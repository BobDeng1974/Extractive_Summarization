the @entity0 has quietly walked back a 2012 directive from the service 's highest - ranking officer that would have rejected female recruits and officer candidates who ca n't perform three chin - ups as part of their physical fitness training			1
the reason – 55 per cent of the women attempting the test are failing			0
just one per cent of men ca n't complete the exercise			2
' women are n’t able to make the minimum standard of three pull - ups , ' @entity0 spokesman capt. @entity14 told reporters on friday			1
the startling admission , and the military 's course - correction , came after just three out of 15 females successfully graduated from the @entity0 ' enlisted infantry training course in november			1
2013 was to be a ' phase one ' transitional year , according to a november 2012 directive from @entity0 commandant gen. @entity60 , with females having a choice of which test to attempt			0
' phase two will commence on 1 january 2014 , ' @entity60 had ordered			0
' pull - ups will replace the @entity66 [ flexed arm hang ] portion of the @entity69 [ physical fitness test ] ... to pass the pull - up portion of this event , females will be required to execute at least three ( 3 ) pull - ups			1
' now , with a 180 - degree pivot in the face of widespread failures , @entity0 commanders ' early predictions that the change was a no - brainer seem more optimistic than realistic			0
in november 2012 , major general @entity82 told @entity83 - 10 in @entity84 that women ' are getting closer and closer to combat , and they need to be in top physical condition as well			2
' general @entity60 , commandant of the @entity0 , ordered the tougher fitness standards for females in december 2012 , but his january 1 , 2014 deadline for implementation wo n't be met after just three women graduated from infantry training nearly a year later ' we decided to execute because there is no reason why we should n’t do this , ' lt. gen. @entity93 told a reporter for the corps ' website a year ago			1
' women are fully capable of accomplishing it			0
it 's more recognition of the changing role of women , the changing capabilities and the changing demands that we place on them			0
' @entity109 said then that the @entity46 would initially set the bar at eight pull - ups for a perfect score , or three for the minimum passing grade , ' and then we will raise or lower that after we see how our female @entity0 do in the year			1
' they did n't do so well , according to a report from @entity116			0
as the @entity36 armed forces integrate women into combat roles , some fear putting them in harm 's way without preparing them for the rigors of active fighting			0
@entity46 will be eligible to participate in combat - ready forward units in 2016			2
@entity0 officers declined to speak with @entity116 on the record , but conceded the pull - up requirement was being put off because it would cost them both new recruits and active @entity46			1
females can serve in most @entity0 units but , just like their male counterparts , they can be discharged from the service if they fail an annual physical fitness tests			1
the change was to take place in two phases , including giving females the choice through 2013 of sticking with the old standard , which required them to hold on to a bar with their elbows flexed for 70 seconds @entity145 , a retired @entity146 lieutenant colonel , told @entity116 that ' young women , in spite of all the training and all the best intentions , are not going to be the equal of young men in terms of upper body strength			1
' his new book , ' @entity155 : how cowards are pushing women into combat , ' argues that @entity160 gender politics are sacrificing combat readiness on the altar of political correctness			0
other experts , female @entity0 among them , insist that women can meet the new standard if they spend enough time in the gym			1
and 45 per cent of them are making the grade			0
' females need to realize we all have to start somewhere , and we have more than enough time to prepare for this , ' corporal @entity171 told @entity0 in december 2012			0
' about a year ago , i was only doing two pull - ups			2
i began weightlifting and targeting specific muscles beneficial for doing pull - ups , and now i can do nine			2
' corporal @entity179 told a defense website a few weeks earlier that she reached the goal after a half - year of intense workouts			0
lance corporal @entity183 insisted that she can do eight pull - ups now , a year after being unable to complete just one hitting the gym : nearly half of female @entity0 are meeting the new standard , but the @entity0 now says that 's not enough -- and is scrapping it for 2014 ' six months ago , i could n’t do one pull - up , my triceps were non-existent , and my biceps were about as hard as a pillow - top mattress , ' @entity179 confessed			1
but ' a month into my new workout regimen i was able to perform three proper pull - ups and have since worked my way up to 12 , ' she said			2
lance corporal @entity183 , who co-hosts the official ' @entity198 ' program on @entity199 , said in a november 2013 broadcast that ' last year , i could barely do one pull - up , and now i 'm up to eight			2
' so i 'm taking advantage of the extra time to complete my goal of 12			0
' a @entity0 web page set up to help female recruits cope with the new physical fitness standard is still active , but the testing requirement now appears destined to be a historical footnote .			1

just three out of 15 female recruits managed to graduate from the @entity0 ' infantry training program in november
55 per cent of women – including active @entity46 – ca n't do three pull - ups , while just 1 per cent of men fail the exam
the new standard was ordered by the service 's commandants in late 2012
now the @entity46 say they **'re** scrapping the requirement for now , allowing women to pass their physical fitness tests without the new *challenge*
existing standards allow female @entity0 and recruits to pass muster by hanging for 70 seconds from a pull - up bar with bent elbows
may women in the @entity0 insist they **'re** meeting the new minimum requirement
@entity46 will be eligible for full war - zone combat duty in 2016
