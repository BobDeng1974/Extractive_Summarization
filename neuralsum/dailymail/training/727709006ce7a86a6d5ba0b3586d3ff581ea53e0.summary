by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 04:19 est , 24 february 2014 @entity3 : 16:23 est , 24 february 2014 @entity4 has officially launched its first @entity6 handsets – the much - rumoured @entity7 , the x + and @entity8 - at an event in @entity1			1
the x and @entity7 + are both entry - level devices with 4 - inch screens , while the @entity8 is larger at 5 - inches			1
the x is available now for 89 euros			2
the x + and @entity8 go on sale from april for 99 euros and 109 euros respectively			1
the x range ( pictured ) has been designed to look similar to @entity4 's current basic @entity19 , which run @entity20 the @entity21 and @entity23 prices for the phones have not yet been announced			2
@entity4 's ceo also announced the @entity27 phones will be reduced as a result			0
the @entity7 is an entry - level device with a 4 - inch screen , @entity32 camera and just 4gb of memory			1
the x looks similar to @entity4 ’s current basic @entity36 smartphones and is due to go on sale next month			1
elsewhere , the screen has a low 800 x 480 resolution and is powered by the 1.2 ghz dual - core processor with @entity41			0
despite being the first @entity6 handset from the @entity45 firm , it has chosen to run an older version of the @entity48 - owner software – android 4.1 jellybean			1
the most up - to - date version is @entity6 4.4 @entity50			0
camera wise , the @entity7 comes with a rear - facing @entity53 camera and the @entity8 includes a @entity55 front - facing device and @entity32 on the back			1
both the @entity7 and @entity7 + will be available in bright green , bright red , cyan , yellow , black and white			2
the @entity8 will be available in bright green , orange , cyan , yellow , black and white			0
all three devices are powered by the @entity66 dual core processor and support @entity67 , letting people switch sim cards to get better deals			0
the x range has been designed to look similar to @entity4 ’s current basic @entity19 , which run @entity73 software			1
@entity4 made the announcement at the annual @entity76 event in @entity1			0
@entity4 also announced a basic smartphone called the 220 , with a @entity79 camera , for 29 euros and the @entity80 for 45 euros			1
the @entity7 series is a significant release for @entity4 , despite the basic specifications			0
previous @entity4 handsets ran the @entity20 operating systems , and although the software has slowly been gaining ground on both @entity6 and @entity88 , it still lags behind			1
@entity20 has been criticised for being difficult to use and runs a fraction of the popular apps seen on the other platforms			0
@entity6 , on the other hand , holds the majority share of the smartphone market in every region globally and has an app store with more than 700,000 apps			0
it is also synonymous with budget and low - end handsets because its intuitive design appeals to less technical users			0
@entity4 will be hoping to attract this end of the market , as well as appeal to emerging markets with the release of @entity7 and @entity7 +			1
it has n't abandoned @entity20 completely , though			0
although the operating system is android based , @entity4 has added the tiles and personalisation features seen on @entity20 @entity36 500 ( pictured ) has a @entity79 camera and starts at $ 69 ( £ 42 ) , the 502 and 503 handsets both have @entity32 cameras and costs $ 89 ( £ 55 ) and $ 99 ( £ 61 ) respectively			1
pictured is @entity4 chief executive @entity115 speaking at the @entity116 in @entity1 similarly , the @entity7 range does n't use @entity48 apps or cloud services			2
it seems @entity4 has chosen @entity6 purely for the apps than the interface , and will use @entity124 's cloud services including @entity125 instead			0
the @entity7 range also complements the firm ’s existing range of budget handsets , namely the @entity36 range			1
the @entity36 range starts at £ 42 ( $ 69 ) with @entity79 and @entity32 camera models			2
the original @entity132 handset was announced in may last year and began shipping in june			0
it has a 3 - inch screen , @entity137 camera and comes in red , green , cyan , yellow , white and black			0
the @entity7 and @entity141 are both entry - level devices with 4 - inch screens , while the @entity8 is larger at 5 - inches the latest @entity36 devices , announced in october added improved sharing options , for example , photos can be shared with one click to @entity149 , @entity150 , over @entity151 and now @entity152			1
@entity36 500 has a @entity79 camera and starts at $ 69 ( £ 42 ) , the 502 and 503 handsets both have @entity32 cameras and costs £ 55 ( $ 89 ) and £ 61 ( $ 99 ) respectively			1
the @entity7 , @entity7 + and @entity8 are a vast departure to what we 've seen before from the manufacturer - but the customisable , tiled @entity88 is similar to what we got from @entity4 's @entity27 range , according to @entity163 , mobiles expert at @entity164			1
' @entity4 's new smartphone family might run on @entity6 , but it does n’t give users access to the @entity169 store , ' he said			2
' however , it will have all of the big - name apps like @entity149 , @entity171 and @entity150 , as well as @entity4 's own here maps and @entity173			0
' also , with some clever leverage of @entity124 's services with a month 's free @entity171 calls and the @entity125 cloud storage service , the @entity7 range proves a great entry to the smartphone ecosystem for new users			0
' he added that the lack of easy app access might hold @entity4 back but , with a little bit of effort , @entity6 software can be installed on the higher end models via a microsd card			0
however , @entity163 said that could prove a barrier for those without the know - how , or lacking the inclination			0
' the @entity8 sports a large five - inch screen			1
it 's nothing new – screens have been getting bigger for a while – but it shows @entity4 is keeping up with the @entity201 , and phones like the five - inch @entity203 , matching current competition in terms of popularity , ' he said			1
leaked images of the new @entity4 handses emerged earlier this month , under the name @entity7 teaser invitations to this morning ’s press conference hinted towards this name , too , before a series of ‘ early built ’ images were posted on @entity212 site @entity213			2
rumours about a @entity4 handset running @entity6 began towards the end of last year , and these leaked shots appeared to confirm it ; with grids and icons similar to those found on existing @entity6 phones			2
this is likely to be the last @entity4 release before @entity124 officially takes over , following an acquisition in september			0
@entity4 chief executive @entity115 holds up the @entity7 handsets at the @entity116 in @entity1 the launch of an @entity6 @entity4 phone is the company ’s latest foray into new areas of the market			1
alongside the @entity231 , @entity4 also launched its first tablet last year – the @entity27 2520 10.1 - inch tablet running @entity234 it also launched its first 6 - inch , phablet device , the @entity4 1320 , to compete with some of the other larger models on the market including the @entity238 and the @entity240 range			1
@entity4 ’s wider offering may have something to do its recent takeover from @entity124			2
@entity124 signed a deal to buy @entity4 ’s phone business in september for 5.4bn euros ( $ 7.2bn ; £ 4.6bn )			2
@entity4 has also licensed its patents and mapping services to @entity124			0
the purchase is set to become official soon and 32,000 @entity4 employees will transfer to the @entity252 - based firm , which recently hired a new ceo @entity253 .			0
