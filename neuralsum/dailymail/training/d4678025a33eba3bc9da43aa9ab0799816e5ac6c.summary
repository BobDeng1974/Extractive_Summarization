the contents of a @entity2 time capsule dating to 1901 has been revealed with the box containing letters , photographs , newspaper clippings and the book ' @entity8 , 1896			1
' the capsule was removed last week from the head of lion statue that has long stood guard over the @entity13			1
the @entity14 , which oversees the historic building , released an inventory of the items wednesday			2
items are stacked inside a shoebox - sized 1901 time capsule in @entity2			2
the capsule contained letters , photographs , newspaper clippings and the book @entity8 , 1986 a piece of wood with the hand written description : ' @entity28 removed from the @entity30 age of same 21 years in 1900 ' is displayed after it was taken from a 1901 time capsule in @entity2 the presence of a red hardcover book , with no visible title , surprised the organization because it had not been included on a list discovered by an ancestor of a man who worked on the statue , nor was it referenced in a recently - uncovered 1901 newspaper article about the time capsule			1
when the book was later opened , it revealed the title ' @entity8 , ' followed by the subtitle , ' @entity47 of the @entity48 , ' and transmitted to @entity49 on dec. 7 , 1896			2
@entity50 would have been president on that date			0
@entity52 , the society 's spokeswoman told the @entity54 that the book was probably just put in to use up space			0
portrait photographs of city and state elected officials are displayed - among those depicted are @entity2 mayor @entity60 , top left , and @entity63 gov. @entity62 , bottom right , who both held office at the time a nail from @entity68 and a nail from the @entity13 are displayed after they were taken from a the time capsule ' basically , the secretary of state would publish the book annually			1
' @entity74 , archivist for the @entity14 , judged the materials that were tightly packed into the box to be in remarkably good overall condition , which she credited to the capsule being tightly sealed to prevent any deterioration or water damage			1
some details will apparently remain under wraps a bit longer , however , including the contents of a letter that was sealed into a plain brown envelope that read : ' a message to @entity87 from the daily newspapers at @entity89			0
' the letter is believed to be a missive to future generations written by a group of @entity2 journalists			0
it was not immediately clear when it might be opened			0
among the political campaign buttons listed on the inventory was a @entity100 - @entity99 campaign button			1
rumors : the society , which manages the @entity13 , first learned about the possible existence of the time capsule years ago from the great - great - granddaughter of @entity106 , a craftsman who had worked on building renovations and was believed to have placed the time capsule in the lion 's head a peek at the goods : the men opened the box , which historians said likely contained documents from circa 1901 red book : @entity118 was a red book			1
the experts on hand declined to even inspect it , citing its fragile condition @entity100 , who won a second term as president in 1900 , would be assassinated only months after the time capsule was placed in the lion 's head , with @entity99 , then vice president , succeeding him			1
other items in the box included photographs and business cards of local elected and appointed officials along two nails , one from the @entity13 and one from another historic @entity2 building , the @entity68			1
the @entity13 , the first seat of @entity63 state government , was an administrative building in colonial times and a focal point of patriotic fervor			2
@entity146 soldiers gunned down five protesters outside the building in 1770 , an event that became known as the @entity150			0
one of @entity2 's most popular tourist attractions , the @entity13 has a storied history			2
handover : @entity154 handed off the century old copper box as the scalped golden lion looked on no crown jewel : the lion statue was placed atop @entity2 's @entity13 in 1901 and the shoebox - sized metal box placed inside and promptly forgotten it was once the seat of @entity162 rule in the northern colonies , and the original lion statue and an accompanying unicorn statue symbolized the unification of @entity162 and @entity167			1
it was just outside the building that @entity146 regulars opened fire on a crowd of protesters in 1770 , killing five people in what would become known as the @entity150			0
in the summer of 1776 , the newly - signed @entity176 was read for the first time to @entity178 from a balcony of the building , which would later serve as the first seat of @entity63 government			0
the plan is to put a new time capsule in the lion 's head , this one made of titanium			0
the society is currently soliciting suggestions of what to put in it , but said one item will be a medal from the ill - fated 2013 @entity194			0
@entity178 have whispered about the existence of a time capsule inside the head of the lion statue placed atop the city 's @entity13 for years			2
the rumors began when a woman purporting to be the descendant of the statue 's sculptor came forward , but the denizens of the @entity63 town have had to wait until now to know for sure			0
