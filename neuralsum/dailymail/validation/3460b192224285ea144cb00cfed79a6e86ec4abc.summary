males of a species of crab , nicknamed after @entity3 because of their hairy chests , spend largely separate lives from the females , according to new research			1
in a study looking at the private life of the deep - sea crab known as the ' @entity3 ' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents 1.5 miles deep near @entity14			1
this , according to the @entity16 research , is because of the conflicting demands of feeding and raising young among the sexes			0

it is a type of yeti crab recognised for their hairs , or setae , along their and limbs that they use to cultivate the bacteria which they eat			0
the new are slightly different in that they exhibit long setae on their undersides			0
they were named after actor @entity3 because of his hairy chest			2
despite living apart from females , the males live in remarkable density			2
in some places , scientists say the crabs reach as many as 600 individuals per square metre			0
in 2010 , a @entity16 expedition revealed a ' lost world ' of deep - sea animals including the crab named after the @entity57 star thriving on the ocean floor near @entity14			2
using a deep - diving remotely operated vehicle ( @entity63 ) to examine the distribution , size and sex of these crabs at the vents , dr @entity59 and colleagues from the @entity61 have now pieced together their private lives			0
dr @entity59 said : ' the life cycles of deep - sea animals have been largely hidden from us until now but thanks to more frequent expeditions and advances in technology , we are getting a clearer picture of the natural history of the ocean depths that cover most of our world			0
' the researchers found that large male @entity3 crabs live highest on the mineral spires of the deep - sea vents , closest to the hot fluids that jet from them			1
a university spokesman said : ' at the base of the mineral spires , smaller males mingle with females in spectacular piles , many crabs deep , where they get together to mate			1
' the females then crawl away from the bustling piles of crabs and the warm mineral - rich fluids seeping from the seafloor , which can be toxic to their young			1
' away from the mineral spires , the few crabs found by the researchers were all females , carrying developing offspring under their curled - up tails			1
males do n't share in ' child - care ' arrangements with the females , and can climb up the mineral spires of the vents to take advantage of the warmth and conditions best suited for growing bacteria on their hairy chests ' moving away from the warmer waters of the spires takes the females across a gauntlet of predators , such as large sea anemones and seven - arm sea stars			1
' away from the vents , the cold water of the deep @entity14 also slows down the metabolism of the adult female crabs , making them less active than in the warmer waters of the jostling piles			2
' however , the conditions away from the vents may be more stable and less harmful to their offspring for their early development , making the journey of the females worthwhile			0
males , meanwhile , do n't share in ' child - care ' arrangements with the females , and instead can climb up the mineral spires of the vents to take advantage of the warmth and conditions best suited for growing bacteria on their hairy chests			1
by scraping off and eating these bacteria using comb - like mouthparts , the males can grow much larger than the females			1
study co-author dr @entity143 said : ' deep - sea vents are island - like habitats on the seafloor , and discoveries like these show that our exploration of the life that thrives around them has only just begun			0
' the @entity3 crab was discovered in 2012 living around volcanic vents off @entity28			0
