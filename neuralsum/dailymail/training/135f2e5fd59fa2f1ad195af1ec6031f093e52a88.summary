a deaf five - year - old girl due to undergo surgery in a hospital reduced to rubble by the @entity5 tornado has finally had the operation after a nurse dug her hearing implant out of the debris			1
@entity10 , a @entity11 orphan adopted by an @entity13 doctor last year , was due to have a cochlear hearing device implanted in her ear last week			1
but the implant , which costs between $ 25,000 and $ 30,000 , was lost when the @entity17 was destroyed during the storm which wrecked 20,000 homes and killed 24 people last monday			2
@entity10 's operation was then postponed indefinitely while doctors considered the logistics of finding a replacement implant			2
happy ending : @entity10 , aged five , can be seen smiling as doctors test out her cochlear implant after a nurse found the missing device among the rubble of a hospital destroyed in the @entity5 tornado before the storm : @entity10 had been due to undergone the surgery at the @entity35 in @entity5 tragedy : the @entity17 was left as just a shell of the building after a tornado hit the area in @entity5 last monday speaking after the storm , @entity10 's adoptive mother @entity42 told kjrh : ' well , her device is somewhere between @entity46 and @entity47			1
i do n't know what happens when a tornado takes the device away			0
' when nurse @entity54 heard about @entity10 's predicament , she spent hours digging through the rubble until she found the computer - sized box holding @entity10 's implant			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' the staff wanted something good to happen this week			0
they wanted @entity10 â€™s journey to keep moving forward			0
an amazing community of folks have helped make this happen in the midst of so much tragedy			0
' @entity10 underwent a successful surgery at the @entity69 on friday morning - meaning the five - year - old can finally hear in both her ears			1
search : nurse @entity54 spent several hours searching through the rubble of the @entity17 in the aftermath of the tornado to find the cochlear implant success : after the cochlear implant was retrieved , @entity10 was able to undergo an operation to have it placed in one of her ears @entity10 , who was unable to speak , hear or use sign language last year , can now hear in both ears after she had one cochlear implant in february and her second on friday the schoolgirl had previously undergone the cochlear implant surgery to correct the hearing in her other ear in february			1
a cochlear implant is an external device that receives the sound through a microphone , computer processes the sound and delivers the information to an internal device placed under the skin			0
but at one time , it was thought @entity10 would never be able to hear			0
@entity10 was placed in a @entity11 orphanage after she was found abandoned by her birth mother in a town square when she was just eight - months - old			0
she had no access to medical treatment to help improve her hearing until she was adopted by @entity42 , a doctor of audiology at the speech and hearing clinic @entity109 , and her family last year			0
the family then concentrated on helping @entity113 , who was unable to speak , hear or use sign language , to be able to hear for the first time by organising for the five - year - old to have cochlear implants in both ears			1
giving hope : @entity10 's adoptive mother , doctor @entity42 , said staff at the @entity17 , pictured after the storm , wanted some good to happen in the aftermath of the tornado the cochlear implant was in a storage cupboard at the @entity17 , pictured , in @entity5 when the storm hit			2
nurse @entity54 remembered where it had been stored and set out to find it			2

but her @entity13 adoptive family arranged for her to undergo surgery to implant a $ *30k* hearing device at @entity35 in @entity5
the *expensive* device was lost when the hospital was destroyed in storm
nurse @entity54 spent hours digging through rubble to find the device
