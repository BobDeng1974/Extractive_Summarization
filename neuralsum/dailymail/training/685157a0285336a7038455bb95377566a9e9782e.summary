first lieutenant @entity6 bailed out near the insurgent group 's de facto capital of @entity10 on wednesday after his f - 16 warplane was damaged during an airstrike			1
the 26 - year - old is the first foreign military pilot to fall into the extremists ' hands since an international coalition began its aerial campaign against @entity18 in september			0
the full - colour monthly magazine , which is distributed online as a pdf document , also contains a lengthy article apparently by captive @entity32 journalist @entity31 , as well as praise for @entity35 hostage taker man @entity34			1
lt @entity22 , who is pictured wearing an orange jumpsuit , describes how his jet was hit by anti-aircraft fire near @entity10 , which is located on the banks of the @entity40 in northern @entity5			1
' we entered the region of ar - @entity10 to sweep the area , then the striker jets entered to begin their attack , ' he was quoted as saying			1
' my plane was struck by a heat - seeking missile			1
i heard and felt its hit			2
' the other @entity3 pilot in the mission – the first lieutenant pilot @entity51 – contacted me from a participating jet and told me that i was struck and that fire was coming out of the rear nozzle of my engine			0
' i checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning			0
the plane began to deviate from its normal flight path , so i ejected			2
' i landed in the @entity62 by parachute and the seat caught on some ground , keeping me fixed , until i was captured by soldiers of the @entity0			2
' @entity0 fighters hold lt @entity22 after he was captured near @entity10 , @entity5 , last week elsewhere in the interview , lt @entity22 answers questions about himself and the coalition involved in airstrikes against @entity0 targets			1
he said his role in the mission was to destroy anti-aircraft positions and guard against any enemy jets			0

the @entity89 has denied that @entity18 shot down the @entity3 aircraft			0
the head of the @entity89 military 's @entity92 , general @entity91 , said the @entity89 will not tolerate @entity18 's ' attempts to misrepresent or exploit this unfortunate aircraft crash for their own purposes '			0

like previous articles in @entity20 attributed to mr @entity31 , the latest piece - headlined ' meltdown ' - appears right at the end of the magazine as its final article			1
it is not clear if the 43 - year - old wrote the article himself or if his name was simply added to another 's work , but it does appear to be written in a less - formal , more journalistic tone than others in the magazine			0

while holding the hostages , @entity34 made two demands - to be delivered an @entity18 flag and to speak directly with @entity137 prime minister @entity146			0
@entity0 's editorial sidesteps the issue of @entity34 's dubious morality , which included outstanding charges for more than 50 sexual offences , saying : ' the fact is ... that any allegations leveled against a person concerning their past are irrelevant as long as they hope for @entity158 ’s mercy and sincerely repent from any previous misguidance			1
' @entity18 had called on @entity160 to kills disbelievers in the @entity162 , including @entity137 .			0
