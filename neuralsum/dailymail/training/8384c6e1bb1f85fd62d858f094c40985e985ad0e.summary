thinking of buying underwear for the party season but daunted by the prospect of traipsing from shop to shop , spending hours being measured and trying on bras ? ordering online and taking the time to try them on at home is far more appealing			1
but given that i ’ve oscillated from a post-pregnancy @entity11 to the @entity13 i was a few months ago , could i really buy a bra over the internet and actually expect it to fit ? a new online brand , @entity18 , claims its measuring method means its bras will fit any woman			1
i put this device to the test , pitting it against other online approaches — while expert bra fitter @entity25 gives me her verdict			1
uses its own sizes and measuring system , a strap called the @entity42			1
you have to send off for this ( £ 4 plus £ 1.50 postage ) and it takes a couple of days to arrive			2
this gives you a body frame measurement ( a letter from @entity51 to @entity52 ) ; your body depth ( small , medium or large ) ; and breast volume ( from one to 21 )			2
you then order one of six bras			1
i chose @entity59 , £ 69.99			2
ordering time : with up to 504 sizes , sometimes the bras are made to order and delivery ( £ 4 ) takes two weeks			1
after i ’d placed my order , @entity18 ’s @entity64 called me			1
as i fell between two sizes , she sent me both — i could send back the spare — plus an extender for the band and an instructional dvd			2
my verdict : feels unlike any other bra			2
the material was super-soft , but i did n’t like the 1950s ‘ torpedo boobs ’ look			2
i liked that the band sat low on my back , but though i ’d been warned the bra is meant to feel tight , i found it uncomfortable			2
@entity80 : i was pleasantly surprised			2
but while the design was supportive , the cups seemed to flatten @entity84 ’s breasts and make them point in different directions , and it was far too tight under the breast bone			2
7/10 @entity88 @entity89 measuring process : the site has a video showing the differences in look and feel between a good and bad fit			1
a three - step guide to finding the perfect fit specifically excludes a tape measure			1
instead , it tells you what to look for when you stand in front of a mirror in your current bra			2
so , if you are wearing a @entity106 where the back is riding up , reduce the back size to 32 — but , if the current cups fit you should also increase the cup size , to a @entity110 because a @entity111 is a smaller cup than a @entity106			1
i was satisfied that @entity13 was right for me , so i chose a @entity115 design called @entity116 ( £ 32 ) in @entity117			0
ordering time : standard delivery cost £ 3.95 and took three days			1
my verdict : hello , boys ! this plunge - cut , moulded bra made me feel quite sexy although it did n’t fit properly			1
it pushed my breasts up so they were spilling out , but i ca n’t help thinking it would be fun for a night out			1
@entity80 : @entity84 likes this for the wow factor but it ’s way too tight , puts too much pressure on her shoulders and will give her backache			0
5/10 @entity132 @entity133 the measuring process : in the @entity110 - plus lingerie section , i clicked the link to the @entity138 and followed a step - by - step guide to measuring yourself			0
first , you put on the best - fitting bra you already own			0
next , you choose between an everyday bra , a maternity bra or a sports bra — i chose the first			0
then you measure your ‘ underband ’ — just below where your bra sits			0
you enter this measurement , along with the size , brand and fit of the bra you ’re wearing , then answer questions about your age and build			1
i turned out to be the @entity155 i thought i was all along and chose the @entity156 ( £ 22.50 ) because i thought the pale purple colour was pretty			0
ordering time : delivery cost £ 3.99 and the bra arrived the next day			1
my verdict : despite the secure fastening and underwiring , the silky material initially felt comfortable			0
but after half an hour , the straps started digging in to my shoulders , and although it seemed to be the right size , i realised my breasts looked a bit saggy			0
@entity80 : not bad for the price but the cut is wrong for @entity84			0
she needs a full - cup bra that will support her properly and although @entity132 describes this as a full - cup , it ’s actually a half - cup with a deep lace trim , that ’s constructed in a way that dragged @entity84 ’s breasts down			0
6/10 @entity180 lace - lingerie.com measuring process : despite a huge choice , there are no guides to tell you how to find a bra that fits , only a list of the different styles			0
given that the 32 - band bras i ’d tried from @entity132 and @entity88 had been slightly on the tight side , i gambled on a larger back size — and , as @entity88 suggested , a smaller cup			1
i ordered a @entity195 in the @entity196 ( £ 42 ) , which caught my eye			0
ordering time : delivery is £ 3 and can take up to five working days			1
my verdict : this bra is slightly padded , which makes it very comfortable			0
it seemed to fit well			1
the cup size worked and i did n’t get the ‘ four boob ’ effect that often happens when i spill out of a bra			0
my only quibble would be that the shoulder straps are too narrow			0
@entity80 : quite a good bra for @entity84 as it ’s bigger around her rib cage , which she needs			0
it has a good shape and will work well under a t - shirt			0
but there is not enough support and only one hook and eye at the back			0
8/10 final verdict it ’s ironic that for all the fancy approaches to measuring , the bra that @entity25 thought fitted me best was from the site that gave no guidance on how to find a bra that fits			0
while i ’m loath to tackle the @entity229 crowds , this has rather proved that there ’s no substitute for going into a shop , being properly fitted and trying on bras .			1
