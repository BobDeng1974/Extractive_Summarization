@entity1 ’s groundbreaking @entity0 has returned stunning images , revealing an enormous canyon and its @entity4 in orbit			1
the spacecraft itself entered orbit around @entity8 in september 2014 , and has now started returning key data as its mission continues			0
this included the switching on of a new methane sensor yesterday , which has allowed scientists to measure the amount of radiation on the @entity17 - and could help in the search for life			1
although @entity22 is the larger of the two moons , it is still only about 14 miles ( 22km ) across , and completes an orbit of @entity8 once every seven @entity28 hours			0
the odd colour of @entity8 is due to the specific filters used by the camera the latest images , released by the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , include a spectacular @entity35 view of @entity36 , a huge volcano on the surface of @entity8 that has its peak 10 miles ( 16km ) high			1
volcanic despoits can be seen on the flanks of the mountain in the image , which was mapped from an altitude of 6,653 miles ( 10,707km ) and has a resolution of 1,824ft ( 556 metres ) per pixel			0
the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) has released amazing images from its @entity0 ( @entity0 )			1
among them is this @entity35 view of @entity36 , a huge dormant volcano on the surface of the planet			1
volcanic deposits can be seen on its flanks the @entity33 's @entity0 ( @entity0 ) , @entity1 's first spacecraft launched to @entity8 , arrived 23 september 2014 to study the @entity8 surface and atmosphere and demonstrate technologies needed for interplanetary missions			1
one of the working group 's objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between @entity64 's @entity63 spacecraft and @entity0 , as well as other current and future @entity8 missions			2
the team are also searching for methane on the surface , which could indicate signs of life on the planet			2
the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) instrument on the spacecraft was used to help map the topography of the region			0
an equally spectacular image reveals @entity22 , one of the two moons orbiting @entity8 ( the other is @entity25 ) , silhouetted against the @entity8 surface			1
although @entity22 is the larger of the two moons , it is still only about 14 miles ( 22km ) across , and completes an orbit of @entity8 once every seven @entity28 hours			0
the images were taken with the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) on the spacecraft , which weighs 2.9lbs ( 1.3kg ) and is used to view the surface of @entity8 and its moons			2
in a close - up view of the surface , the @entity85 captured a shot of the huge @entity92 – which at more than 2,500 miles ( 4,000km ) long is one of the largest canyons in the solar system , covering nearly a fifth the circumference of @entity8			2
the image was taken from an altitude of 15,000 miles ( 24,000km ) , with a resolution of about 0.7 miles ( 1.2km ) per pixel			0
a portion of the canyon known as @entity103 was also observed by the spacecraft , revealing fracture patterns in the surface			0
the images of the surface could help scientists understand the geological processes taking place on @entity8 at a local scale			2

the images could help scientists understand the geological processes taking place on @entity8 at a local scale this week also marked the return of results from the @entity128 for @entity8 ( @entity130 ) payload on the spacecraft , which will detect the presence of methane in the atmosphere			1
it measured the reflectivity of the @entity8 surface , to work out how much of the sun ’s radiation is reflected back into space by the planet			2
officials said they will not release the data until it has been peer - reviewed , though , reported sen. but it is the hunt for methane that is of particular importance , as it could indicate whether there is life on @entity8 or not			0
dr @entity149 , a former scientist on @entity1 ’s @entity151 lunar mission said on his blog that the use of the @entity130 was important as it proved the instrument worked			0
‘ this is like scaling @entity156 for an instrument specialist like me , ’ he said			0
this image , showing the limb of @entity8 against the void of space , was taken using the @entity85 from an altitude of 8,449km the @entity33 's @entity0 ( @entity0 ) , illustration shown , is @entity1 's first spacecraft sent to @entity8			1
it arrived 23 september 2014 to study the @entity8 surface and atmosphere and demonstrate technologies needed for interplanetary missions			0

the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) has released amazing images from its @entity0 ( @entity0 )
they include an @entity174 of the @entity36 volcano and a silhouette of the @entity4 against the planet
another image reveals the enormous @entity92 canyon on the surface of the red planet
this week also marked a *successful* test of a methane sensor , which will search for signs of life on @entity8
