in just a decade , the caterpillar of the horse chestnut leaf - mining moth has munched its way across most of @entity3 and @entity4 , turning leaves brown months early and shrinking conkers			1
scientists say there is no way of controlling the tiny but insatiable pest – and we will have to get used to seeing fewer horse chestnut trees			1
the warning follows a project in which thousands of ‘ citizen scientists ’ , including schoolchildren , helped researchers monitor the moth ’s march			1
the leaf - miner moth has eaten its way through greenery in most parts of @entity3 and @entity4 in the past decade information from the volunteers showed that the @entity27 invader has spread to most of @entity3 and @entity4 since first being spotted in @entity28 , south west @entity29 , in 2002			1
the caterpillars , which are no bigger than a grain of rice , burrow through the leaves of conker trees , causing them to turn brown and autumnal in appearance , even in the height of summer			2
although this does n’t kill the horse chestnut outright , there are fears about the long - term health of the trees which can live for several hundred years			1
it is already known that the average conker has shrunk in size from 1.25 inches in diameter to just one inch			0
one of the keys the pest ’s success is the speed at which it breeds			2
within just one summer , a single female can give rise to 5,000 moths , and a tree will appear to shimmer with activity as the young emerge from their silken cocoons			0
the citizen science project , reported in the journal @entity59 ( must credit ) , also revealed that it takes just three years from the first moth arriving in an area for the majority of horse chestnuts to turn brown before their time			1
@entity69 , of the @entity70 in @entity71 , said : ‘ it looks like autumn has come early			0
scientists say there is no way to stop the pest which turns leaves brown months early and shrinks conkers ‘ they are going brown in august , rather than in november			1
’ experiments done by the volunteers showed that although @entity81 does have parasitic wasps that prey on the caterpillars , there are not enough to them to keep the pests under control			0
dr @entity69 said that ultimately , the disease could cause horse chestnuts to disappear			0
this is because as the trees die from other causes , they are being replaced with other species because people do n’t want to see ugly , brown pitted leaves			2
the moth , which was first spotted in @entity98 , northern @entity27 in the 1970s , is a poor flier and is thought to hitch lifts on cars and lorries			0
dr @entity69 , who worked with @entity103 on the study , said : ‘ there has been quite a lot of research money spent and scientists have had to say there is nothing that can be done to stop its spread			2
‘ although , what is interesting is that it got to @entity114 in 2011 and does n’t seem to have got any further north – i was expecting it to get to @entity117 about two years ago			0
it has n’t yet and i ’m intrigued			0
