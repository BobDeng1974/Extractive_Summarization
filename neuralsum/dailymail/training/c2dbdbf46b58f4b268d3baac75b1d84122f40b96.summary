by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:46 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:52 est , 17 december 2013 a book advising newly - wed women how to behave advises : ' it 's true , you 're not yet an experienced cook or a perfect housewife			1
what 's the problem if he ( your husband ) tells you so ? tell him that he is right , that it 's true , that you will learn			1
on seeing your sweetness and your humility , your effort to change , this will also change him			0
' it sounds like an extract from an outdated @entity22 handbook but it is in fact from a recently published book that 's become a bestseller in @entity27 and @entity28			1
' @entity29 ' , meaning ' get married and be submissive ' , is the title of the self - help tome that calls on women to be ' loyal and obedient ' to their husbands			1
step back in time : a new book advises women to try and be the perfect housewife in order to please their husband another of its pearls of wisdom explains : ' if you only do what is right for you , what you think , then you are not married to a man , you are married to yourself			1
instead of doing that , you should submit to him			0
' it is already causing controversy with feminists and politicians who have called for it to be banned and one women 's group staged a protest in @entity28 where they ripped up copies			1
controversial : the book advises wives to be loyal and obedient to their husbands one reviewer on @entity61 commented : ' what an insult , a real setback for the struggle of women and men in favour of equality			1
' what has riled many even more is that the book is written by a woman - @entity27 author @entity72 , 43			1
a devout @entity74 married with four children , her book is based on the teachings of @entity78 and has been published by the archbishop of @entity82 's printing press @entity80			1
in an interview with @entity85 , she said as well as turning to the @entity86 , she based her advice on the happy marriages of herself and her friends			2
she defended her work saying it was well - received when it was first published in @entity27 in 2011 and she ca n't understand why @entity28 woman are so offended after it was translated and published in @entity28 this year			1
she said : ' i never said that women should get married in general			2
i said that some women , my friends , just those , they should get married ( in fact , now the majority have done so )			2
because i know and i know that to them that is the way of happiness			0
and anyway , not just women , men too , of course			2
' women and men together			2
i believe that at the bottom of the human being there is a sense of emptiness that fills only giving themselves completely to someone			0
this is the way of happiness			0
' she added that a submissive woman will have a happy marriage because : ' @entity122 is the way to make room , to accept , to be put under as the columns of a cathedral , as the foundation			0
not a dirty word : author @entity72 believes the key to wedded bliss is submission ' of course you can be happy			0
because man is seduced by the beauty of a woman , able to support , to be a mother to those she meets			1
and then he can win his enormous selfishness , which is the default male			0
' the book states ' we [ women ] like humiliation because it is for a greater good ' but @entity72 rejects criticism that this incites violence against women			2
she said : ' if disturbing is the word submissive , then burn all copies of the @entity86			0
in that case it will be an honour for me to go to the stake			0
' that there is an incitement to violence against women is a pure madness ... i reject violence			0
