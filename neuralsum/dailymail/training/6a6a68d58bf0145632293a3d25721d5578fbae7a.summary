by @entity1 reporter published : 10:17 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 12:39 est , 29 may 2013 three feminist activists have been arrested for holding a topless demonstration outside a court today in protest against the jailing of a @entity9 member of @entity11 feminist group @entity10			1
@entity10 activist @entity12 , 19 , was arrested at another protest against @entity15 's treatment of women earlier this month after she sparked outrage across @entity9 by posting topless pictures of herself online			1
a @entity15 preacher called for the student to be stoned after the pictures , showing @entity24 with the words : ' my body belongs to me ' written across her bare chest in @entity20 , were uploaded to @entity28			1
the 19 - year - old said last month she wanted to do one last topless protest before she left the country to study journalism in @entity59 and was arrested may 19 in the religious center of @entity61 where an ultraconservative @entity15 group had hoped to hold a conference before it was banned by police			1
@entity24 was charged with carrying a dangerous object , apparently a canister of pepper spray , and will appear before a judge tomorrow her supporters , three foreign activists , today disrobed in front of the @entity36 to protest against the court case			1
the trio , one @entity72 and two @entity59 , approached the entrance to the ministry wearing coats which they took off , revealing naked torsos scrawled with ' @entity77 '			0
extreme views : salafist preacher @entity80 ( pictured ) called for @entity12 to be ' quarantined ' and stoned to death after comparing her to someone with a contagious illness wearing just jean shorts , the women chanted in @entity87 ' @entity86 ' and ' women 's spring is coming ' as people in the crowd attempted to cover them			2
the women then climbed up on the gates of the @entity36 until police pulled them down and hustled them shouting into the building as an angry crowd , many of them lawyers there for work , gathered			2
' this is against our religion , ' said @entity101 , a young woman wearing the black robes of a lawyer but without a conservative headscarf			0
' for these women to take off their clothes as part of freedom of expression is against our religion and the traditions of @entity113 - @entity15 @entity9 society			2
' the crowd surrounded the area where the women were being held and when the activists were transferred to a nearby building the crowed surged forward before being fended off by police			0
' the @entity36 is not a house of ill repute , ' said @entity121 , an angry bystander			0
the crowd also attacked journalists attempting to cover the event as well as lawyers who tried to protect the reporters			0
police took several journalists into custody to take statements from them as witnesses before releasing them			0
@entity9 's prosecutor 's office later announced the women had been taken to main police station for questioning before being charged , and their embassies have been informed			1
the @entity59 consul visited the women and said they were in good spirits			0
lawyers said they could be charged with an attack on public morals or threatening public order , offenses which could carry up to a year in prison			0
a member of @entity10 who identified herself as @entity146 told @entity147 that the activists were protesting the treatment of women in the @entity113 world			2
in custody : the three women , two @entity59 and the other @entity72 , shouted : ' @entity154 , ' outside the court before they were arrested clash : members of the public in the @entity15 country attacked the @entity33 activists for exposing their breasts until the women were escorted away by police officers agenda : speaking ahead of the demonstration , one of the @entity10 activists called @entity146 said they were protesting against the treatment of women in @entity113 countries ' we are attacking the @entity36 one day before the trial for @entity10 prisoner @entity12 to demand to let @entity12 free and to give up @entity15 tradition judging women 's liberation , ' she wrote			1
' @entity10 is planning first topless action in @entity113 country as a sign of a big changes ... @entity33 is announcing the women 's spring that ( is ) starting in @entity9			1
' though it has the reputation as one of the most progressive countries in the @entity184 for women 's rights , overwhelmingly @entity15 @entity9 is still a relatively conservative society and there has been a rise of piety since the overthrow of the secular dictatorship in 2011			2
@entity10 , which has carried out semi-nude protests in @entity193 , has only recently started focusing on the @entity184 , especially after @entity24 's actions			1
@entity184 feminists , however , have largely condemned their approach saying their tactics are foreign to the largely conservative region and risk provoking backlash against women and real concerns like achieving equality			0
the protests come during a particularly delicate period for @entity9 , where decades of progressive legislation are being challenged by a rising trend of conservatism and there is a struggle over the identity of this @entity211 nation of 10 million			0
facing prison : the @entity33 activists face charges of threatening public order and attacking public morals which could carry up to a year in prison the activists were protesting on behalf of @entity12 who sparked controversy in recent months by publishing nude images on @entity28 and writing on her chest : ' my body belongs to me '			1
