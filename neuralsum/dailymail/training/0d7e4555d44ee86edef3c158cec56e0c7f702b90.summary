@entity0 comfortably saw off the challenge of @entity2 on @entity3 , winning 3 - 1 as @entity4 impressed			1
the club captain operated in a deeper midfield role and netted twice , while @entity7 also got on the scoresheet before @entity10 's late consolation			2
@entity12 's @entity11 rated the players at @entity14			0
@entity0 beat @entity2 3 - 0 on @entity3 with @entity4 netting twice at @entity14 @entity15 : – has enjoyed an inspired season and smartly dived to his left to tip away a powerful drive from @entity19 when the score was 0 - 0			1
only beaten by @entity10 's late penalty - 6.5 @entity22 : – showed why @entity23 put him straight back in the team after injury			2
commanding in the air , does the job @entity28 and @entity29 do for @entity30 and @entity31 even though he was foolish to concede a late penalty - 7 @entity33 : – part of his rehabilitation after being substituted early at @entity36			0
had relatively little to do but fortunate to escape booking with rash challenge - 6 @entity38 : – scored for both sides in the corresponding fixture on @entity3 two years ago			2
much quieter this time as part of a three - man defence - 6 @entity22 showed @entity43 exactly why he put him straight back into the starting line - up @entity45 : – did n't maraud forward as much as usual , possibly to protect @entity33 and @entity22 , but did his job and was taken off early to get rest ahead of sunday 's trip to @entity49 - 6 @entity50 : - appreciated by @entity43			0
might not quite be @entity0 's best player as claimed by sir @entity52 , but very , very good - 6.5 @entity4 : – the modern - day @entity54			1
able to time his breaks from midfield into the penalty area perfectly , as underlined perfectly with his two first half goals			0
always seems to score against @entity2 , and also set up @entity58 with a pinpoint diagonal cross - 8 @entity4 strokes home the opener after @entity62 's fine work for the assist @entity64 : – playing his best football for @entity0 under @entity43			1
great delivery led to a glorious chance for @entity62 , and stayed away from any diving controversy - 6.5 @entity69 : – nearly gave away an early penalty when he clipped @entity71 but made amends with two glorious passes for @entity4 's first half goals , one with his left , one with his right - foot			0
a natural no 10 - 7.5 @entity7 : – unselfish performance from the @entity79			2
although the designated centre - forward , he peeled wide at times to give @entity4 space to run in from deep			0
but he was in the @entity84 position to head his deserved goal			0
booked for lunge at @entity87 @entity62 : – not quite 100 per cent sharp but beginning to show why he 's considered world - class			0
should have scored early on but stretched brillinatly to set up @entity4 for his opening goal - 7 @entity7 heads home @entity0 's third of the afternoon past @entity94 substitutions : @entity96 ( for @entity50 62 5.5 ) - the game was already won when he came on and he looked a bit rusty @entity99 ( for @entity62 65 6 ) – popular figure at ot having come through the ranks @entity103 ( for @entity104 80 ) @entity43 : – this was the day van @entity23 's attacking philosophy came into play			1
still has work to do at the back though - 7.5 @entity2 ( 5 - 3 - 2 ) @entity110 : – impossible to miss in bright orange but his defenders would have preferred him to try and catch set - pieces rather than opting to punch even the easier ones			1
no clangers with the goals though - 5.5 @entity19 : – like @entity71 , he was a positive wing - back and tested @entity15 with a thumping right - foot shot after 19 minutes - 6.5 @entity120 : – difficult job in a rejigged @entity2 defence as manager @entity123 is n't normally a 3 - 5 - 2 man - 6 @entity125 : – @entity2 's captain but did n't really organise the back - five as a leader should , although in mitigation @entity0 's movement was very good - 5.5 @entity130 : – his career has n't really lived up to its early promise			1
a booking for a late and clumsy foul on @entity69 summed up his afternoon - 5.5 @entity130 struggled at @entity14 - his career has n't lived up to its early promise @entity71 : – got forward well from left wing - back and one foray led to a strong penalty appeal when he ran across @entity69 and there was clear contact between the pair - 7 @entity140 : – one of only two survivors in the @entity2 team from the side that lost 4 - 3 at @entity14 on @entity3 two years ago			1
did n't make an impact here - 6 @entity145 : – is the target for clubs in january but his agent wo n't be sending out any video footage of his performance here - 6 @entity151 : – thankless task trying to get the ball off @entity0			1
credit that he kept going and won a late consolation penalty - 6 @entity157 : – tough for a 17 - year - old striker to appear at @entity14 on his @entity160 debut and to be honest it was a little bit early for him , but that 's not a surprise - 5.5 @entity166 : – he is a decent goalscorer but when he 's not scoring , contributes little to the cause			0
one dribble in the first half was his most impressive turn - 5.5 @entity166 offers little going forward when he 's not scoring for @entity2 substitutions : @entity172 ( for @entity120 63 ) – @entity2 looked slightly more solid when he came on - 6 @entity10 ( for @entity157 63 ) – a mystery why he did n't start ahead of @entity157			1
@entity174 scored a penalty and will surely start against @entity176 on sunday - 6 @entity177 ( for @entity166 82 ) @entity123 opted for an unfamiliar 5 - 3 - 2			2
the wing - backs actually did well but there was a gap in class in most other areas of the pitch - 6.5			0

@entity0 beat @entity2 3 - 1 at @entity14 on @entity3
@entity4 put in a performance @entity54 would be proud of
striker - cum - midfielder scored twice in the comfortable *victory*
@entity7 also on target while @entity10 nets for *visitors*
