a total of five possible @entity2 presidential candidates have now entered the minefield of vaccine politics , with @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 joining in the fight launched monday by gov. @entity9 and sen. @entity10			1
the scrum grew as news emerged that president @entity14 's $ 4 trillion 2016 budget proposal cut $ 50 million from federal government vaccination programs			1
@entity7 , a former ceo of @entity16 who is busily burnishing her conservative credentials in advance of the 2016 race , said ' parents have to make choices for their family and their children ' about whether to have them immunized against measles , mumps , rubella and other deadly diseases			2
she spoke to a @entity29 writer last month			0
' i think vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense			0
but that 's me , ' @entity7 said			0
' i do think parents have to make those choices			0
i mean , i got measles as a kid			0
we used to all get measles ... i got chicken pox , i got measles , i got mumps			0
@entity10 , an eye surgeon , stirred the pot hours later with a claim that he knew of cases of ' walking , talking , normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines			1
' @entity5 , a world - renowned pediatric neurosurgeon before his retiement , tried to sidestep the controversy monday night with a statement to reporters that leaned toward medical science			1
' although i strongly believe in individual rights and the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit , i also recognize that public health and public safety are extremely important in our society , ' he said			1
' certain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization policies in this country and we should not allow those diseases to return by foregoing safe immunization programs , for philosophical , religious or other reasons when we have the means to eradicate them			1
' @entity49 sen. @entity6 told @entity96 that every child should be vaccinated – but left the door open for parents with religious objections to say no. ' most states include an exception clause for good faith religious convictions , and that ’s an appropriate judgment for the states to make , ' he told @entity96			1
' but on the question of whether kids should be vaccinated , the answer is obvious , and there ’s widespread agreement : of course they should			0
we vaccinate both our girls , and encourage all parents to do the same			0
' on @entity115 , @entity6 told reporters that the sudden focus on the issue generated by @entity9 's gaffe ' is largely silliness stirred up by the media			1
' ' nobody reasonably thinks @entity9 is opposed to vaccinating kids other than a bunch of reporters who want to write headlines , ' he said			2
@entity126 is facing a measles outbreak that has hit at least 102 people , including a large cluster centered on the @entity131 theme park in @entity132			0
according to the @entity135 , most of the @entity132 cases involved children who never received the @entity138 vaccine , which protects against measles , mumps and rubella			2
house speaker @entity142 said tuesday morning during a press conference that ' i do n't know that we need another law , but i do believe that all children ought to be vaccinated			1
' and @entity148 , a spokesman for likely presidential contender and former @entity49 gov. @entity150 , told @entity96 that @entity150 backed efforts to boost vaccination numbers			1
' governor @entity150 strongly believes in protecting life and has sought to improve the health and well - being of @entity156 in a variety of ways , ' the spokesman said , ' including increased immunization rates			1
' in 2003 , at the height of the national smackdown over vaccinations and autism , @entity150 signed an executive order directing his government to adopt a comprehensive plan to increase immunization rates statewide			1
in a ' today ' show interview that aired monday , president @entity14 agreed that parents should vaccinate their kids : ' there is every reason to get vaccinated , but there are n't reasons to not			1
' that pronouncment left conservatives in a tricky spot			0
a @entity179 poll published last week showed that @entity2 are more likely than @entity180 – by a 35 - 19 per cent margin – to believe parents should be permitted to opt out of government - mandated vaccines for their children			1
concerns have run rampant sine the mid- 1990s over thimerosol , a mercury - based preservative that was used in live vaccines until a decade ago			2
anti-vaccine activists , relying on science that was later debunked , claimed the ingredient was tied to a spike in autism diagnoses			1
the biggest cheerleader for that idea was @entity198 , the lawyer - turned - green - avenger who also argued that a different , organic form of mercury was contaminating ocean fish			0
actually ... the earth is somewhat egg - shaped and the sky is black – it only looks blue because of hwo the atmosphere interacts with light			2
but @entity211 's larger point is sound : vaccines work @entity213 : @entity198 ( center ) posed with his mother @entity215 ( right ) and @entity211 ( left ) at last year 's ' @entity216 of @entity218 ' gala ; @entity198 , mroe than anyone else , was responsible for spreading the discredited theory that vaccines cause autism @entity198 wrote a conspiracy - minded article in 2005 , published in print by @entity226 and online by @entity227 , in which he claimed scientists and government agencies were colluding with vaccine makers to cover up evidence of a brain - wasting epidemic			1
@entity227 withdrew the article six years later and deleted it from its website , although copies have survived online elsewhere			0
even though liberals originated the idea that vaccines caused autism , the fallout has left some conservatives who crusade against government overreach lining up behind discredited theories , and threatening to punish candidates who disagree			2
@entity246 's political editor explained on monday , anti-vaccine advocacy remains largely ' a liberal fringe issue			1
' ' the people not vaccinating their kids against the diseases once declared defeated do n't live in @entity249 or @entity250 or a particularly conservative part of @entity252 or @entity253 , ' she wrote			0
' the strongholds are in places like @entity259 , @entity260 , and @entity261 , @entity132			0
the affluent , the educated , the enlightened , the ones who believe in purity and science – people in liberal enclaves are the ones rejecting one of the 20th century 's major scientific achievements			2
' after the facepalm moment : @entity51 governor @entity9 ( right ) and his wife @entity271 ( center ) posed tuesday with @entity274 's chancellor of the exchequer @entity273 ( left ) as they arrived for lunch at number 11 @entity278 in @entity279 @entity9 made his jaw - dropping statement monday morning while touring a flu vaccine manufacturing facility in @entity282			1
' it 's much more important , i think , what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official , ' he said			0
' i also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well			0
so that 's the balance that the government has to decide			2
' his spokesman blasted out a correction of sorts after the comment caught fire online			0
' to be clear : the governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated , ' the qualification read			1
' at the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination , which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate			2
' @entity9 wrote an open letter to @entity51 voters in 2009 , saying he had ' met with families affected by autism ' and heard ' their concern over @entity51 ’s highest - in - the - nation vaccine mandates			1
' ' i stand with them now , and will stand with them as their governor in their fight for greater parental involvement in vaccination decisions that affect their children , ' he wrote then			0
the @entity338 editorial page castigated the governor on monday night , pointing to 644 @entity126 measles deaths last year in 2014 , ' the most in a quarter - century			0
' outbreaks like this year 's measles cases ' are the result of plunging vaccinations rates , ' the @entity338 opined , ' as more parents believe false information about vaccines , including claims that they cause autism			1
' @entity10 ended up pushing forward and doubling down on his libertarian views in a @entity352 interview			0
' the state does n't own your children , ' he declared			0
' parents own the children , and it is an issue of freedom and public health			2
' @entity211 , the @entity180 ' likely standard - bearer for 2016 , tweeted monday night that ' the science is clear : the earth is round , the sky is blue , and # vaccineswork			1
let 's protect all our kids			0
' @entity96 reached out to representatives of other potential presidential candidates , including @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity6 and @entity373			2
none of them responded to questions about vaccine politics .			0

former @entity49 gov. @entity150 ' strongly believes in protecting life and has sought to improve the health and well - being of @entity156 in a variety of ways , including increased immunization rates , ' according to a spokesman
@entity9 and @entity10 had leaped into the growing *fracas* over mandating childhood immunizations , leaning toward ' optional ' vaccines
sen. @entity6 said the sudden focus on the issue generated by @entity9 's gaffe ' is largely silliness stirred up by the media '
@entity14 seemed to *evolve* on the issue , saying in 2008 that *research* on vaccine safety was *inconclusive* but insisting the opposite on monday
@entity211 , too , *pandered* to anti-vaccine activists the last time she ran for president – but now says the science is settled
house speaker @entity142 said tuesday that ' i do n't know that we need another law , but i do believe that all children ought to be vaccinated '
@entity413 's 2016 budget cut $ 50 million from federal government 's vaccination programs
