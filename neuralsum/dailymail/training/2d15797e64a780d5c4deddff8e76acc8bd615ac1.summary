one of the eight people whose crack - related prison sentences based on mandatory minimums has been revealed to be the cousin of the @entity5 governor of @entity6			1
governor @entity7 is a close ally of president @entity8 's but he said that he was not involved in the commutation application for @entity10 , his 39 - year - old cousin who was sentenced to life in prison for possession and intent to distribute			1
' there ’s a significant age gap between the two , and the governor has no recollection of having met mr. @entity10 , ' spokeswoman @entity15 said of the 59 - year - old governor			1
related : one of the eight prisoners whose drug charges were commuted was @entity25 ( left ) who is the first cousin of @entity8 supporter @entity6 governor @entity7 ( right ) connected : @entity7 has been a supporter of president @entity8 for years ( seen together in 2009 ) and the @entity6 governor was an @entity8 surrogate on both campaigns ' governor @entity7 had no involvement in any application for a commutation of mr @entity10 , ' she told the @entity36			1
mr @entity7 is close with the president and was one of the top contenders to be mr @entity8 's attorney general but @entity41 was chosen instead			1
the two have spent time together on and off the campaign trail , as mr @entity7 was a surrogate for the president 's re-election campaign and dined with the @entity47 during their summer vacation in @entity49 this year			1
the outgoing governor 's spokeswoman said that while mr @entity7 was aware that his cousin was in a @entity53 , @entity55 prison , she said that he did not know the details of the case			1
@entity10 was originally sentenced in 1994 to life imprisonment with five years ' supervised release and a $ 1,000 fine because of his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute both cocaine and crack			1
he will now be released on april 17 , 2014			0
in a statement published online following the commutation announcement , the president said that the eight men and women had been sent to jail because of an ' unfair system ' and all had served at least 15 years in prison , many under mandatory minimums that required judges to impose long sentences even if they did n't think the time fit the crime			1
' if they had been sentenced under the current law , many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society , ' @entity8 said			2
' instead , because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust , they remain in prison , separated from their families and their communities , at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year			2
' commuted sentences : president @entity8 speaks to the media on wednesday - on thursday he announced that he was commuting the sentences of eight men and women convicted of crack cocaine offenses the commutation is seen as an attempt to redress the glaring racial disparity between those serving sentences for crack possession and those jailed for carrying cocaine			1
crack cocaine offenses were treated more harshly under old laws than those involving the powder form of the drug and led to tens of thousands of black people serving long prison terms , while those caught with cocaine - who were more likely to be white - were handed lenient jail time			1
of the eight , some had been sentenced to life imprisonment for dealing crack cocaine at the age of only 17 because of harsher sentences created in the 1980s designed to fight what was seen as an epidemic of the highly addictive drug on the streets of @entity123			1
@entity124 : this @entity127 , @entity126 native was charged with possession with intent to deliver cocaine base and possession with intent to distribute marijuana and sentenced in 1997 to spend more than 24 years behind bars in the previous five years of his presidency , @entity8 had only commuted one drug sentence and pardoned 39 people			1
the men and women will be released in the next 120 days and the lucky eight include several high profile inmates who have been at the forefront of campaigns to have their tough drug - conviction quashed			0
many of the eight , such as @entity147 , @entity148 , who was 22 when he was sentenced to three life terms for a 1993 drug deal were young			0
civil rights groups have been fighting vociferously for @entity147 and last year thr @entity153 's inspector general critcized the department 's pardon office for mishandling his petition for clemency			2
@entity158 , a former pardon lawyer who used to work at the @entity153 who represents @entity147 said that her client is ' very grateful ' to the president			0
' he was absolutely overcome , ' said @entity158 to the @entity163			0
' actually , i was , too			0
this has been a long haul for him , 20 years			0
he just was speechless , and it ’s very exciting			0
' another recipient of a commuted sentence from the president is @entity174 , of @entity53 , @entity55			2
he was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for dealing crack at the age of 17 as was @entity179 of @entity180 , @entity126 , who got a life in prison for hiding her boyfriend 's stash of crack cocaine in 1997 , aged just 27			1
in both of these cases the judge who handed out the mandatory sentences called them unjust and said their hands were tied			0
a pardon forgives a crime and wipes out the conviction , typically after the sentence has been served			2
a commutation leaves the conviction but ends the punishment			0
@entity197 ( left ) and @entity198 ( right ) the @entity199 said each of the eight people whose sentences were commuted was sentenced prior to the @entity203 and that they would have received lesser sentences if convicted of the same crime today groups that advocate for prisoners have criticized @entity8 for being stingy with his power - @entity209 granted 189 petitions for pardon and 11 for clemency , while @entity213 granted 396 for pardon and 61 for clemency			1
the old sentencing guidelines subjected tens of thousands of blacks to long prison terms for crack cocaine convictions while giving far more lenient sentences to those caught with powder who were more likely to be white			1
it was enacted in 1986 when crack cocaine use was rampant and considered a particularly violent drug			1
under that law , a person convicted of possessing five grams of crack cocaine got the same mandatory prison term as someone with 500 grams - 100 times - of powder cocaine			1
the @entity203 reduced the ratio to about 18 - 1 and eliminated a five - year mandatory minimum for first - time possession of crack			1
this also comes at a time when draconian sentences are going out of fashion as the nation deals with having only five - percent of the world 's population , but 25 - percent of its prison inmates			2
according to a release issued by the @entity199 , the commutations were granted to : @entity249 , executive director of the @entity250 , called on @entity8 do to more			2
' kudos to president @entity8 for commuting these eight people , but shame on the president for not commuting many more			1
' with over 100,000 people still in federal prison on nonviolent drug charges , clearly thousands more are deserving of the same freedom , ' he said			0
@entity199 officials say he does n't believe that clemency can be a solution on a large scale , because it 's such a time intensive process and there are thousands of federal inmates affected			0
the @entity8 administration wants to make the @entity203 retroactive , and the president called on @entity269 to act in the new year			2
' commuting the sentences of these eight @entity123 is an important step toward restoring fundamental ideals of justice and fairness , ' @entity8 said			2
' but it must not be the last			0
in the new year , lawmakers should act on the kinds of bipartisan sentencing reform measures already working their way through @entity269			0
' together , we must ensure that our taxpayer dollars are spent wisely , and that our justice system keeps its basic promise of equal treatment for all			0
' @entity286 : @entity8 said in a statement that the @entity288 has begun to right to a decades - old injustice , but for thousands of inmates , it came too late @entity199 officials say @entity8 had only approved a single clemency petition among more than 8,000 received because it 's the only one that had been given a positive recommendation by the @entity153			2
according to one senior @entity8 aide , the president expressed frustration that he was n't receiving more positive recommendations			2
so @entity199 counselor @entity299 approached @entity301 's @entity300 early this year and asked them to take a hard look at the clemency petitions filed by convicts for any that might have merit , given the change in the drug sentencing law			0
the @entity300 responded this fall by presenting the @entity199 with 21 recommendations for pardons and clemency			0
@entity299 oversaw an independent analysis and turned over detailed memos on the cases to the president , who signed off on them all , according to @entity199 officials			0
in august , attorney general @entity41 announced a major shift in federal sentencing policies , targeting long mandatory terms that he said have flooded the nation 's prisons with low - level drug offenders and diverted crime - fighting dollars that could be far better spent			0
as a first step , @entity41 has instructed federal prosecutors to stop charging many nonviolent drug defendants with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences			0
his next step will be working with a bipartisan group in @entity269 to give judges greater discretion in sentencing .			0

president @entity8 commuted the prison sentences of eight people on thursday saying their crack cocaine offenses did not justify life sentences
the eight have each served more than 15 years in prison
one of those people was @entity10 , the 39 - year - old cousin of @entity6 governor and @entity8 friend @entity7
@entity7 , 59 , said that he has never met his cousin and was not involved with the commutation
presidents typically use the end - of - year period to consider ways whether to grant requests for commutations or clemency from convicted offenders
