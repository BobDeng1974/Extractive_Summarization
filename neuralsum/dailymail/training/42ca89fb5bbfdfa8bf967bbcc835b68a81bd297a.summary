when @entity1 decided to treat her daughter to a longed for @entity3 after weeks of begging , the worst she expected was a slightly lighter purse			1
but the young mother could not believe her ears when her seven - year - old daughter 's new toy apparently launched into a foul - mouthed four - letter outburst			1
ms @entity1 , 25 , claims that she could hear the doll - which is based on @entity3 ’s web reality series , @entity13 in the dreamhouse - exclaiming ' what the f * * * ? ' as her daughter @entity15 played with it			1
but has since taken the doll away after she discovered an unfortunate sound problem the mother has told of her shock after buying her seven - year - old daughter the @entity3 doll - which seems to exclaim ' what the f * * * ' the doll is programmed to say 15 different phrases , including ' @entity29 ' , ' i love a makeover ' , ' there is no substitute for glitter ' , and ' to the salon ! '			1
but ms @entity1 , who is currently pregnant with her second child , said she was left mortified when she claims to have heard the doll swear			1
she attempted to return the @entity39 toy to the @entity40 where she bought it - but was told there was nothing they could do because she had lost the receipt			0
@entity46 has contacted @entity39 for comment			0
it is believed the doll is actually programmed to say ' off the hook ' but , because of an unfortunate sound problem , it has been misheard by a number of customers as the foul - mouthed exclamation			2
ms @entity1 , from @entity55 , @entity56 , said : '' she loved it and has been playing with it constantly ever since			2
we had n’t really paid that much attention to it or what it was saying			0
' then a friend of ours picked up the toy and i heard it say ‘ what the f * * k ’ loud and clear , i was so shocked			1
the doll - operated by these buttons - is programmed to say 15 different phrases , including ' @entity72 ' , ' i love a makeover ' , ' there is no substitute for glitter ' , and ' to the salon ! ' ' we ’ve taken it off her now			2
we just told her that the doll had been bad and was swearing so it had to go			0
' she was disappointed , of course , but she understood that it is wrong to swear and so the doll had to go			0
' she added : ' i have tried taking the doll back but because i do n’t have the receipt they say there is nothing they can do			0
' i think it ’s very irresponsible of the toy company - they know that children are going to be playing with these toys			0
' i ’m not the only one who has heard it			0
you can hear it loud and clear , it definitely says ‘ what the f * * * ’			1
