by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 25 january 2014 updated : 16:46 est , 25 january 2014 a terrifying video has surfaced showing teenagers riding on the outside of a train as it crosses the @entity8 bridge that links @entity9 with @entity10			0
a growing numbers of teenagers in search of internet fame are risking their lives by performing dangerous stunts on the @entity18 subway in what is becoming an alarming online trend			1
@entity21 is filled with clips of young men in their teens and early 20s jumping across the tracks , playing chicken with trains and ' surfing ' on moving trains			2
the growing number of recordings and images posted online showing the underground acts of daring has left @entity18 officials calling for a crackdown on thrill - seekers			1
still , it is too close for comfort for the majority the teenagers subway surf on a @entity43 train over the @entity44			2
in this latest video , the participants believe they are taking part in some kind of extreme sport - the ultimate expression of rebellion			0
no thought is given to the fact that their actions not only cause massive delays for fellow strap - hangers but the risk of serious injury or death does not even occur			0
why do n't you take the @entity43 train ? the @entity43 train crosses the @entity44 on the top level of the bridge from where there are spectacular views - but you do n't need to be on the outside of the train to enjoy them ! mind the gap : the ledge on which the subway surfer stand is n't even wide enough to hold their foot precarious perch : just one false move , and it 's all over			1
surely ? walloped : there were 53 subway - related deaths last year - but 151 people were hit by trains down time : the subway surfing took place in the middle of the night when there were very few passengers on board the @entity8 bridge was eerily quiet risk : subway surfing causes massive delays for fellow strap - hangers and of course risk serious injury or death the video was filmed with the riders hanging on at the rear of the train and then played in reverse once it was posted online			1
it gives the appearance that the riders are at the front of the train as it hurtles through the subway system			0
at one point , the surfer lifts both of his legs in the air and clings on to the rear of the train and it crosses the bridge			0
a few minutes later the young mans feet are seen on the precariously thin ledge at the very rear of the subway car holding on with just one hand			0
easy rider : the young man shown in this viral @entity21 video ' surfing ' a @entity18 subway is only one of a large community of thrill - seekers who perform risky stunts underground leap of faith : one of the most popular feats among teenage daredevils is jumping across the subway tracks enough is enough : the @entity163 has called for a crackdown on people bent on putting their lives at risk and threatening the safety of others the @entity170 that oversees the sprawling @entity18 subway system has called the stunts ' exceedingly stupid ' and ' extremely dangerous , ' urging the public : ' donâ € ™ t do it			1
' there were 53 subway - related deaths in @entity18 last year			1
even those instances of risky subway feats that do not end in tragedy are stomach - churning to watch			2
in a video that went viral when it hit @entity21 in october 2011 , a grinning young man in a baseball cap worn backwards could be seen ' surfing ' on a moving train by holding onto a door from the outside of the car .			0

there were *55* subway - related deaths in @entity18 in 2012 and 53 in 2013
