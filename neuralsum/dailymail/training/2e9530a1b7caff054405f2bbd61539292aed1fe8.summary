cradling the puppies in his arms , a clearly smitten @entity5 , 54 , said : ‘ i ’m experimenting right now with @entity12 and @entity13			1
‘ i think dogs are good training for babies			2
they are still puppies and they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house			2
‘ this is a bit of a road test for the real thing			1
@entity32 is the girl and @entity13 is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun			2
i would say to anyone thinking about getting a dog – just do it			2
they bring so much happiness into your life			0
’ the @entity39 was given an intimate look inside the life of the pampered pooches in this exclusive set of photographs taken at the music mogul ’s sprawling home			1
the yorkies have free run of the house and spend most nights curled up at the foot of their master ’s king - sized bed			0
@entity5 , who once admitted he was ‘ fanatical ’ about everything in his house being ‘ just so ’ , has clearly relaxed his rules for the new additions to his family			1
in one shot , @entity13 is seen drinking water from a fine china cup and saucer placed on a designer leather side table while @entity12 – who is virtually identical to her brother except for an ear which flops over – perches on a silk cushion on the custom - made sofa			0

normally there is n’t a pillow out of place but he ’s relaxed the rules for the puppies			0
they are very much his babies but he ’s definitely the master			0
he went away recently and when he came back he had to have words with @entity13 because he was strutting a little			0
‘ there was a bit of a drama when one of them almost fell into the swimming pool the other day			0
obviously the whole house will be properly child – proofed before the baby arrives			0
but the dogs have been a wonderful addition to the household			2
@entity5 has a dog trainer but it ’s pretty obvious they are the ones training him now			2
’ it is thought @entity5 named the pooches after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid called @entity117			1
but during an earlier season of the @entity119 , he referred to his fellow judges @entity120 and @entity122 by the moniker , dismissing them with the words : ‘ i think the audience at home are going to disagree with @entity12 and @entity13 here			0

one was labelled , ‘ happiness is 2 puppies asleep ’ , another shows a dozing @entity161 with her eyes rolling back with the caption ‘ @entity32 has gone mad ’ and in another she is lounging on his bed with her tongue poking out , with the message : ‘ @entity12 wants an ice cream			0
