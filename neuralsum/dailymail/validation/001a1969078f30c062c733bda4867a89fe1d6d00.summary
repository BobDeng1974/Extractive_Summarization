teacher @entity0 , pictured , vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog a teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave			1
@entity0 , who has taught @entity9 for the past 28 years , faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct			1
a @entity14 ( @entity15 ) hearing in @entity16 was told mrs @entity17 became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board			1
the 56 - year - old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress			1
@entity33 took the drastic action after suspecting the mother - of - two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the @entity37 later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance			1
however , she was still hauled before the @entity15 - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making ' vexatious ' complaints			1
among the penalties available to the body included striking mrs @entity0 ' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home			1
a panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again			2
mrs @entity0 denied being a troublemaker and said she was ' fighting injustice ' after her complaint about a pupil 's behaviour was not taken seriously			1
she said : ' i am relieved that i am able to carry on teaching			2
i do n't know what i would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances			2
' i 've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job			0
' but despite everything that i have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again			0
' this issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff			0
it is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom			1
' i care too much about my pupils and their welfare			0
' even though they decided the allegations against were proven , i always believed what i was doing was right			1
' and if you can live with your conscience , then you can survive			0
' the @entity15 heard that mrs @entity93 , from @entity94 , south @entity95 , became embroiled in a row with bosses at @entity98 after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil 's ' threatening behaviour '			2
after feeling the issue was not taken seriously , she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later			0
during her period of suspension , it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school 's internal disciplinary processes and made ' vexatious allegations ' to exam board @entity111 in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute			1
case presenter @entity116 said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager , her head of department and headteacher @entity121 - whom she called ' an idiot ' and referred to him being in his ' ivory tower '			0
ms @entity116 added : ' she felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay , because she felt a sense of injustice			1
' we heard today that she did n't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised , but there is still no insight into her failings			0
' she was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding			0
' ms @entity0 had raised issues at @entity98 , pictured , about a ' problem pupil ' however , while the row rumbled on it emerged that @entity140 paid private investigators Â£ 3,600 to tail mrs @entity93 for three days - a move the @entity37 later called ' unlawful '			1
in mitigation , mrs @entity93 told the @entity15 she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years			0
' i had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything i believed i stood for , ' she said			0
@entity152 representative @entity151 told the hearing mrs @entity93 believed she was being disciplined after raising ' a serious safeguarding matter '			2
he said : ' mrs @entity93 believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity , which she found personally devastating			0
' she has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue			0
' i believe the public interest is best served by allowing mrs @entity93 to continue teaching			0
quite clearly , she 's a good teacher			1
' panel chairman @entity161 said the @entity15 was satisfied mrs @entity162 failed to ' behave professionally ' during her disciplinary process and her actions ' fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher '			2
mrs @entity93 , who has been a supply teacher for the past two years , was handed a conditional registration order			2
it means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements , such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress			0
following the decision , she said : ' i 'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now i just want to get back doing what i do best - teaching			2
