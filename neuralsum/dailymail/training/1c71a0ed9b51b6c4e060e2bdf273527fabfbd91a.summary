mr @entity2 , sitting in the @entity0 of the @entity0 in @entity1 , said his ' paramount consideration ' was the girl 's welfare a couple have been given the go - ahead to adopt a three - year - old girl despite separating during the adoption process			1
the couple , who are in their 40s and were married for several years before separating , have been allowed to complete the adoption of the young girl after a court heard how she had developed a strong bond with them and viewed them both as her ' parents '			1
the youngster had been placed in the care of a local authority when she was born , mr @entity2 heard during a hearing in the @entity0 of the @entity0 in @entity1			1
her father had died and she last had contact with her mother when she was five months old			0
she had been placed with foster carers and had then moved in with the couple who were aiming to adopt her			0
the couple had notified a local authority that they were going to separate shortly after making an adoption application			2
since their separation last year , the couple have been living apart and the child has lived with the woman - her prospective adoptive mother			0
mr @entity2 said he had considered ordering the woman to restart the process and make a fresh application to adopt the girl herself			1
but the judge said both the man and the woman wanted to adopt the girl jointly			0
he said he had decided that it was in the girl 's best interests for them to be allowed to adopt - even though they were no longer together			1
he said he had heard evidence from the man and woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , and from a social worker			0
he said it was clear that both the man and the woman were committed to the youngster , that she had developed a strong bond with them and viewed both as her ' parents ' and that they had managed to maintain good relations between themselves			2
' my paramount consideration is [ the girl 's ] welfare throughout her life , ' said mr @entity2			1
the couple , who are both in their 40s and were married for several years before splitting , have been allowed to adopt the young girl after the @entity0 in @entity1 heard how she already viewed them both as her ' parents ' ' there are a number of factors which lead me to conclude that in order to secure and promote welfare throughout her life , it is necessary for her position within this family itself to be secured by an order which makes both her parents			1
' the judge said the man was in ' practical , psychological terms ' the girl 's ' father ' and she was his ' daughter '			2
in the same way , the woman was the girl 's ' mother '			0
he added : ' although the parties are separated , they have continued to co-parent by agreement and , importantly , without significant disagreement or dispute			0
' the factors in this case weigh decisively in favour of my making a joint adoption order in favour of the couple			0
