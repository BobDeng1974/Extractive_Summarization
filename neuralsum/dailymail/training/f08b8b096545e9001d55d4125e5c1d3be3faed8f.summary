a @entity1 florist who refused to provide flowers for a gay wedding rejected an offer from the state to settle a discrimination case by paying a $ 2,000 fine			1
@entity8 , a 70 - year - old grandmother , would n't provide flowers from her shop in @entity11 , @entity1 , for the 2013 wedding of @entity13 and @entity14			1
when longtime customer @entity13 came to @entity16 and asked for the flowers , the devout @entity15 told him her ' relationship with @entity19 ' would n't allow her to do the wedding			1
if the lawsuits are successful , @entity8 could be required to pay damages and legal fees that far exceed the attorney general 's offer to settle the matter			1
in addition to the $ 2,000 fine , the settlement @entity8 rejected said if the florist chose to continue selling flowers for weddings she would have to sell the items to all couples , including same - sex couples			1
in a letter to @entity31 , @entity8 wrote she ' never imagined that using my @entity48 - given talents and abilities , and doing what i love to do for over three decades , would become illegal '			2
she added : ' our state would be a better place if we respected each other 's differences , and our leaders protected the freedom to have those differences			0
' since 2012 , same - sex couples all over the state have been free to act on their beliefs about marriage , but because i follow the @entity66 's teaching that marriage is the union of one man and one woman , i am no longer free to act on my beliefs			1
' @entity1 's constitution guarantees us " freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment			2
" ' i can not sell that precious freedom			0
' video by @entity79 if the lawsuits against her are successful , @entity8 could be required to pay damages and legal fees that far exceed the attorney general 's offer to settle the matter for $ 2,000 @entity8 ( left ) and other at her shop			2
she wrote she ' never imagined that using my @entity48 - given talents and abilities , and doing what i love to do for over three decades , would become illegal ' the offer from @entity31 came after @entity92 judge @entity91 rejected arguments that @entity8 's actions were protected by her freedoms of speech and religion			1
the @entity98 protects religious beliefs but not necessarily actions based on those beliefs , @entity91 ruled			1
the state has the authority to prohibit discrimination and @entity8 can be held personally liable for damages if she breaks bias laws , according to the judge			2
@entity109 , an attorney with @entity79 , called the ruling ' terrifying ' and said @entity31 was targeting @entity8 , @entity108 reported			0
she said : ' he 's using the full power of his office to personally and professionally destroy her			0
' he 's trying to send a message â€” you better shut up if you disagree or you are going to lose everything you own			0
' @entity31 maintains his objective is not @entity8 's financial ruin			0
he said : ' my primary goal has always been to bring about an end to the defendants ' unlawful conduct and to make clear that i will not tolerate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation			0
' before this case began , my office wrote to ms @entity8 , asking her to comply with state law			0
had she agreed to no longer discriminate , my office would not have filed suit , and ms @entity8 would not have paid any costs , fees or penalties			0
' after lengthy proceedings , the court has ruled , the law is clear , and the state prevailed on all counts			0
' @entity8 plans to appeal judge @entity91 's ruling .			1

@entity8 owns @entity16 in @entity11 , @entity1
she would n't sell flowers for wedding of @entity13 and @entity14
@entity92 judge ruled she was n't protected by @entity98 *rights*
@entity8 follows @entity66 's teachings and is ' no longer free to act on beliefs '
if she accepted , @entity8 would provide flowers at same - sex weddings
