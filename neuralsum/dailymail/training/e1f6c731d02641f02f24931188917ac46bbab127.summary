when people learn @entity9 played on @entity11 's football team they usually ask her position			1
the answer ? she was not the kicker , but her boyfriend was			0
female high school football players are n't unheard of , but they are uncommon and usually are n't position players			1

her usual game day attire is pads and a helmet			0

she was n't a starter or a standout , but she played several games and an important role on the team			1
' the best thing about @entity9 is that she really knew her role , ' @entity75 coach @entity74 said			1
' she jumped in every day at practice and wanted to be on the scout teams and played hard on the scout teams and that helped us			2
' teammates : in this november 15 , photo , @entity11 senior @entity9 walks off the field with senior @entity86 after losing in a first - round playoff game at @entity11 in @entity88 , @entity4 huddle : @entity9 ( center ) weaves her way through a group of teammates during a first - round playoff game he said it got players prepared			1

' she came out there and put the time in during two - a - days in the hot sun. she was not that girl out there playing football to say she played football			1
she was out there to play			0
' that 's a football player , does n't matter if it 's a girl or guy , ' he said			1
' it 's a football player			1
' and on the field he said often no one knew whether she was a boy or girl			0

@entity9 , who readied for home games alongside @entity75 's cheerleaders , placed her brown hair , which tumbles past her shoulders , into a long braid and tucked that up inside her helmet			1
only a close look would reveal delicate features common to homecoming queens , not ball players			2
small but mighty : five - foot - tall @entity9 surrounded by her teammates game day : @entity9 ( left ) cheers on her teammates in a first - round playoff game at @entity11 in @entity88 when the team traveled her presence was sometimes surprising			1
