everything i see now reminds me of the child and what i have lost			0
’ his mother @entity97 , 54 , said : ‘ i feel we have had a family bereavement having lost a child that i honestly thought was my grandson			0
i can not think of words to say about how awful it is that a human being could deceive another in this way and cause the hurt and upset it has done to our family			0

instead , judge @entity117 sent her on a ‘ thinking skills ’ programme to help her realise how her appalling behaviour had affected mr @entity15 and his family			1
he criticised @entity0 ’s ‘ immature and self - centred attitude ’ , adding : ‘ the discovery of the child ’s real identity has left them with a feeling of loss similar to bereavement			2

after the totally wicked thing you have done , no one feels sorry for you			0
