the death toll in the battle for @entity3 ’s @entity2 rose to 33 yesterday as fighting between protesters and the police escalated sharply			1
police fired tear - gas and plastic bullets as demonstrators calling for @entity12 ’s army rulers to quit hurled stones and rocks from behind makeshift barricades			1
many of those who died succumbed to bullet wounds , but although protesters have brandished bullet casings , police deny using live ammunition			1
it was the third consecutive day of street battles which have left more than 1,700 people injured and threaten to spiral out of control			0
@entity26 for young and old : at both ends of the protest spectrum , a young man throws a rock at riot police , above left , while a bearded older man wears goggles and a surgical mask to protect himself against tear gas attack last night thousands of protesters remained packed into the symbolic square where demonstrations helped topple detested leader president @entity40 in february			1
a military council has held power since then , but protesters are demanding that it hands over to a civilian government			1
parliamentary elections are due to begin next week , but the protesters want the military out immediately			1
they accuse the generals of acting in the same autocratic way as @entity40 ’s regime and fear they will dominate the coming government just as they have the interim one they appointed in march			0
yesterday that government , under prime minister @entity54 , submitted its resignation to the military council , but is to stay on until a decision on a handover is made			1
foreign secretary @entity60 told the today programme on @entity62 that the military should remain in charge to oversee the elections , but there should then be ‘ the speediest possible transition to civilian democratic rule ’			2
extensive damage : smashed windows , burning buildings and streets strewn with debris are a common sight in the streets surrounding @entity2 as violence continues little cover : demonstrators hide behind a makeshift shield as security forces - on foot and in riot vehicles - approach their position			1
doctors are reporting seeing around 80 casualties an hour sustained attack : protesters flee from tear gas fired by riot police , during clashes at a road that leads to the @entity92 , near @entity2 the military says it will hand over power only after presidential elections , which it has vaguely said will be held in late 2012 or early 2013			1
mr @entity60 said the deaths and injuries were ‘ of great concern ’ , but dismissed claims that the violence undermined hopes that the ‘ @entity105 ’ wave of protests in the region would usher in more democratic governments			0
protesters battled with police throughout yesterday , hurling stones and firebombs and throwing back the tear - gas canisters being fired by police into the square			1
scroll down for footage of @entity2 clashes before the dawn : @entity2 , centre of the @entity12 revolution and now the focus of renewed demonstrations			1
at least 22 protesters have been killed and more than 1,700 injured daylight : riot police have largely secured the square today , but confrontation between protesters and police is continuing in surrounding streets time for prayer : showing the level of unity among protesters , @entity130 stand guard as their @entity136 comrades pray in a respite in clashes with the armed forces in the square a constant stream of injured protesters – bloodied from rubber bullets or overcome by gas – were brought into makeshift clinics set out on pavements around the square where volunteer doctors scrambled from patient to patient			1
police attacked one of the clinics , but were driven back by protesters hurling chunks of concrete from smashed pavements			1
internet clips showed police beating protesters with sticks , pulling them by the hair and , in one case , dumping what looked like a body on a rubbish heap			1
‘ the people had a revolution to live a better life , but look at everything , ’ said protester @entity164 , his eyes streaming from tear - gas			0
islamists , who expect to do well in the elections and suspect the army wants to curtail their influence , dominated the demonstrations			0
@entity176 : holding the flag and facing police in full riot gear with mere stones , young protesters show their determination to make their presence felt not confined to the square : a protester stands in a burning building in @entity3 this morning - one of many buildings damaged during overnight fighting a protester is treated after being hit in the eye , while a field hospital staff member holds spent ammunition collected by protesters			1
security forces have used rubber bullets and live rounds during the clashes analysts say @entity171 could win 40 per cent of assembly seats , with many going to the influential @entity200			2
renewed violence in @entity12 should not dampen optimism about the so - called @entity105 , foreign secretary @entity60 said today			0
he said the military should remain in charge to oversee elections , due to begin next week , but they should be followed by ' the speediest possible transition to civilian democratic rule '			2

he said : ' it is very important that elections take place and that then there is the speediest possible transition to civilian democratic rule in @entity12			0
there are many things the military rulers in @entity12 need to do			2
' the deaths and injuries were ' of great concern ' , he said , but he insisted it did not undermine hopes that the wave of protests in the region would usher in more democratic governments			0
but the weekend unrest drew in many other protesters , including young activists who helped topple @entity40			0
army generals were feted for their part in easing him out , but hostility to their rule has hardened , especially over attempts to set new constitutional principles that would keep the military permanently beyond civilian control			0
the army says the polls beginning on monday will go ahead , but the unrest could deter voters in the capital			0
some @entity12 believe the army council may be stirring insecurity to prolong its rule , a charge it denies			0
protesters also marched yesterday in other cities , including @entity254 where thousands of students called for those responsible for the violence in @entity3 to be punished			2
the @entity258 has no current travel restrictions in place for @entity261 travelling to @entity12 , but it strongly advises them to stay away from @entity2 and the downtown area of @entity3 and to avoid all crowds and demonstrations			2

the @entity258 website says : ‘ the situation is changing rapidly and we recommend that you follow events on local and international news and seek advice from tour operators			0
’ overview : protesters use wooden boards as shields as tear gas is fired by riot police near the @entity92 loaded : police officers with shotguns face in all directions during the violence			2
the weapons fire rubber bullets , which are described as ' non-lethal ' projectiles but can inflict serious injury sending a message : with spent rubber bullet cartridges on his fingers , one protester holds his hand aloft in a classic v for victory sign fighting back : a masked protester carries a tear gas canister back towards @entity12 troops			0
