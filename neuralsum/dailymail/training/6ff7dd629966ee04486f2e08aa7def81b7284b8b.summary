three men were arrested at the scene in @entity12 , as officers seized the marijuana plants			1
neighbouring business owners claimed officers ' had described the drugs haul as the ' biggest they had ever found			1
' they appear to have been very professional			2
they invested heavily in being very secure and very discreet			2
' for a long time we thought it was empty			2
we did n't see anybody coming or going for extremely long periods of time			2
this is n't unusual as lots of the units are used only for storage			0
' they ( the police ) told us they were suspicious about the unit and sent a helicopter over it to scan the temperature but it was no different to any of the others			1
' they were still suspicious about the unit and when they noticed a smell from it they acted			1
' they told us that the plants were growing in insulated boxes which was why nothing showed up on thermal imaging			2
' police officers seized the marijuana plants as they launched an investigation in the large warehouse unit scenes of crime officers , wearing white boiler suits , were seen entering the factory building her father @entity67 , 63 , said he had been told by officers at the scene it was the biggest haul of cannabis they had ever found			1
' our unit is 3,000 sq. foot and they had a double unit and a single unit and upstairs as well			0
it could be as much as 9,000 sq. foot of weed			0
' it 's amazing if you think about it and really brave of them to grow it next door to the police			0
' i 'm really not sure how they thought they would get away with it			0
literally you could throw a brick from the back of this unit and it would land in the police station it 's that close			0
' we had no idea whatsoever what was going on			0
i 'm shocked and very surprised			0
