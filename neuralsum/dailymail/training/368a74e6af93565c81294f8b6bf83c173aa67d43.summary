we are extremely sorry if we have led any team members to believe that is the case and if we have caused them any distress			2
' the only thing we stipulate is that in order to abide by food safety legislation , we ask team members who work in or have to pass through a food preparation area to wear poppies with a secure clasp rather than those secured by a single pin			1
