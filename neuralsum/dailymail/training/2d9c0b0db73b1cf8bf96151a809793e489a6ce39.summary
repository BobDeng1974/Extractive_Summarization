by @entity0 women who are trying for a baby should tuck into a regular helping of @entity6 sprouts , an expert has claimed many people shudder at the thought of @entity6 sprouts , with their minds conjuring up images of bitter , overcooked school vegetables			1
but new research suggests that couples who are trying for a baby should tuck into a regular helping of the festive staple			0
according to studies , nine per cent of all conceptions take place over the @entity21 period , making december the most fertile month of the year			2
parties and festive tipples are thought to be partly responsible for this trend			0
however , @entity25 , a nutritional therapist at the @entity26 , says the increased consumption of sprouts could also play a role			2
she said : ‘ believe it or not , this green micro cabbage is a baby making super food			0
‘ firstly , they are bursting with folic acid which is essential for boosting fertility in both men and women			1
‘ this vitamin rich source also increases sperm levels and helps line the womb with the right nutrients raising sperm survival chances			0
‘ another benefit of this folic rich food is that it also helps to decrease the risk of miscarriages and birth defects			2
’ nine per cent of all conceptions take place over the @entity21 period , making december the most fertile month of the year - this is partly due to the number of parties and the increased alcohol consumption @entity6 sprouts also contain a phytonutrient called di - indolylmethane , which helps women absorb balanced levels of the hormone oestrogen			1
in fact , it binds to environmental oestrogens , like pesticides and hormones in meat and dairy products , and helps rid the body of excess hormones – this boosts fertility			1
the vegetable is also thought to lower cholesterol levels and have anti-inflammatory properties .			0

9 *%* of babies are conceived in december - more than any other month
this is partly down to the parties and increased alcohol consumption
expert says may also be because we eat more @entity6 sprouts at this time
sprouts are high in folic acid which boosts fertility and *reduces* miscarriage and birth defect risk
