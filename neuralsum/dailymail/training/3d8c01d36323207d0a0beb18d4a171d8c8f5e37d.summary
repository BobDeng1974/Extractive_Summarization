when @entity7 accepted a @entity9 friend request from @entity10 , her former boyfriend of 25 years before , she was intrigued to see if he had changed at all			1
gone was the thick mop of black hair and teenage looks , but she realised her feelings were as strong as ever			0
love is in the open air : @entity7 ( left ) was reunited via @entity9 with @entity10 , who is shown in the tent he pitched near her back garden in @entity21 , @entity22 romance rekindled : @entity7 and @entity10 got back in touch last year - 25 years after splitting up in 1986 after he revealed he felt the same way , things then moved so fast he walked out on his wife and ended up living in a tent near her back garden - without her other man knowing			1
now , after their whirlwind reunion last year , the couple have moved into a rented house in @entity35 and are planning to get married in @entity36 once his divorce comes through			0
they originally met at an @entity40 disco in 1985 when ms @entity7 was 19 and mr @entity10 was 16 , but split after a year because he thought he was too young to settle			1
both got married but mr @entity10 could not forget his first true love , so he searched for her on @entity9			1
ms @entity7 , 47 , told the @entity43 that @entity10 's first words to her were ' i 've missed you			2
i 've been looking for you for 26 years '			0
and even though he was married and ms @entity7 was in a new relationship after getting a divorce , they arranged to meet last year			2
how they were : @entity7 ( left ) as she was in the 1980s and ( right ) @entity10 in his youth mr @entity10 , 44 , drove 160 miles to her home in @entity21 , @entity22 , last august and they planned their future together			1
they decided that shop manager ms @entity7 would work out her month 's notice and then they would run away together			0
but mr @entity10 , unemployed at the time but now a supermarket worker , turned up at her workplace a few days later saying he had walked out of his marital home in @entity40 and could not bear to be apart from her any longer			2
he brought his tent so he could be near her until they could be properly together and pitched in a wood near her back garden - unbeknown to her partner @entity67 , 50			1
still in love : @entity10 and @entity7 are planning to marry in @entity36 once his divorce comes through ms @entity7 said : ' living in a small tent - especially during the cold autumn nights - just to be near me was the most romantic thing anyone has ever done			2
' she walked out on mr @entity67 three weeks later , leaving a note on the kitchen table saying she was getting back together with her ex. and the mother - of - two daughters aged 21 and 24 had a bombshell piece of news for mr @entity10 related to their past			1
ms @entity7 revealed that she had discovered she was pregnant six weeks after he left her in 1986 - but had an abortion			0
he said : ' i was stunned			0
maybe i would have stayed and we could have had a life and a child together			0
' ms @entity89 's former partner , mr @entity67 , has forgiven her for dumping him , although he said it would have been nicer to have been told in person that she was leaving rather than through a note			0
however , mr @entity10 's jilted wife @entity93 , 50 , is less upbeat			1
she said : ' [ ms @entity89 ] stole my husband			0
' she may have known him when they were younger , but i was his wife			0

@entity7 met @entity10 , her former boyfriend of 25 years before *...* even though he was married and she was in a relationship
mr @entity10 camped out close to her back garden until they could be properly together
his jilted wife @entity93 , 50 , is angry at woman who ' stole ' her husband
