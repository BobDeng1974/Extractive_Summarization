@entity1 chairman @entity0 claims @entity3 's £ 10million loan is a ' great deal ' for the club - even though the @entity7 outfit has been left with just 25 per cent of its retail business			1
@entity3 has been allowed to tighten his grasp on the @entity12 ' revenue streams after his sports direct firm struck a rescue package with the desperate board			1
in return for his loan - which will be paid in two £ 5million tranches - the cash - strapped @entity16 have given @entity3 another 26 per cent of the @entity22 @entity23 owner @entity3 and his firm @entity24 agree £ 10m emergency loan deal with @entity1 @entity3 - who already placed chief executive @entity26 and finance director @entity27 onto the board - will also be allowed to nominate two more directors			1
the @entity23 owner , who owns 8.92 per cent of the @entity12 , has also managed to grab a floating charge on the club as well as @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and the club 's registered trademarks - including the @entity1 crest - as collateral			2
but he has no claim to @entity7 after fan protests forced him to drop his demand for security on the club 's historic home			2
@entity0 told @entity45 : ' i think it is a great deal			1
i 'm really pleased to get some money into the club			0
' it is just over 12 months since i became chairman and i had three goals			0
one was to make sure this great club never , ever goes into administration			0
chairman @entity0 ( left ) and chief executive @entity26 ( centre ) are fully behind @entity3 's plans ' the second one - there was no money when i joined the club so ( i wanted ) to get some money into the club			1
this deal really moves us a long way to getting some decent money into this club			0
' the third goal was all about the football			0
we 've got to get this club into the @entity71 , into the @entity72 and this sort of money will really help us do that			0
' but @entity0 ducked questions about how he planned to fund such a resurgence while the club continues to hand over more and more cash to @entity3			1
@entity22 is a joint venture set up by the club and @entity24 , with @entity1 owning 51 per cent and @entity3 's company controlling the rest			1
however , @entity24 will now control three - quarters of the business until the first part of the loan is repaid			2
@entity1 fans were already unhappy with deal , claiming profits were unfairly skewed in @entity24 's favour			1
@entity3 wanted to take out a security plan on @entity7 but is unable to do so under the terms of the agreement the club 's accounts showed the company took in £ 7.6million last year - leaving a £ 1.61million dividend to be split between @entity1 and @entity24			1
@entity1 ' share was £ 821,000 but it also owes @entity24 £ 833,000 as the result of ' onerous leases on unprofitable stores entered into by a previous @entity1 management team '			1
now as part of the terms on @entity3 's loan deal , the club will hand over its dividend share to repay these debts - meaning that for every pound collected by its own retail company , @entity1 lost 1.6p			1
the terms demanded by @entity3 for bailing out the club will also see shirt sponsorship cash from season 2017 - 18 onwards ' benefit ' @entity22 - rather than the club itself - for the duration of the loan			2
the first £ 5million - which has no time - limit on when it must be repaid - will be used to repay the £ 3million @entity3 handed @entity1 last october and to cover thursday 's pay cheques			1
the second £ 5million chunk must be handed back to @entity3 within five years			2
the board had a second loan offer on the table from the @entity125 - wealthy fans @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 - but once again put their faith in @entity3 , setting them on another collision course with their own supporters			2
@entity133 of fan ownership group @entity134 said : ' we would love to understand how the arrangements with regard to @entity22 could work to the benefit of the plc which owns our club			0
' it seems that these arrangements are the effective price for the facility being provided			0
there may be no interest on the facility but we would ask for full details of the other conditions that had and have to be met in return for the facility			0
we hope that the directors have been very careful to ensure that their actions comply with their fiduciary duties to shareholders			0
' @entity3 is pulling the strings for now but the balance of power could yet swing away from him in the coming weeks if @entity158 succeeds in routing the board at the general meeting he has called			0
he also faces a hearing with the @entity162 who claim he has breached duel ownership rules .			0

@entity3 and his firm @entity24 agree £ 10m emergency loan deal
@entity1 chairman @entity0 says it is a ' great deal ' for @entity7 outfit
@entity16 have given @entity3 another 26 per cent of the @entity172
