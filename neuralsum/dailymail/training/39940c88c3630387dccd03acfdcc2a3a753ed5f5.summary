by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 22 february 2013 a happy memory of @entity2 : the photo that the @entity4 and @entity5 have sent out to wellwishers she has barely reached the half - way stage of her pregnancy			1
but the @entity5 has been so inundated with good wishes from members of the public that she and her husband , prince @entity13 , have created a special card to thank them			1
in recent days the couple ’s office at @entity18 has been sending out the elegant ‘ thank you notes ’ to members of the public who have written to them in the past few weeks			1
rather than the more traditional - style letter normally sent out by members of the @entity25 , this one is a postcard with a picture on the front of @entity29 taken on their official visit to @entity2 last year			1
on the back is the message : ‘ the @entity4 and @entity5 were touched by your kind words following the wonderful news that they are expecting their first baby			2
' it really was most thoughtful of you and their @entity40 send their warmest thanks and best wishes			2
' inside the special card : a gracious message from expectant parents @entity4 and @entity5 the baby is most likely to have been conceived in early to mid-october , shortly after the couple returned from their tour of the @entity50 have told the @entity51 was not pregnant or actively trying for a baby during the two - week trip due to the anti-malaria medication that she was taking , drugs that she would needed for a further week after returning home on september @entity54 would most likely have conceived either at their homes in @entity60 or @entity61 the time the couple had a series of public engagements including a visit to @entity66 in @entity67 to launch a scholarship scheme in their names on october 8.the following day they visited the @entity73 ’s new training centre at @entity74 in @entity75 october 10 the @entity5 was in @entity76 while her husband attended the funeral of his former nanny , @entity80 evening they met for a private dinner at the @entity84 club in @entity85			1
the following day the prince made a solo appearance at a dinner at @entity18			0
a personal touch : the thank you card that the @entity4 and @entity5 have sent out to people who wrote to congratulate them the card is not signed by @entity5 but the envelope in which it comes bears her distinctive ‘ c ’ cypher			1
the picture on the front was chosen personally by the couple			1
it shows them on the very first day of their tour of south east @entity105 to mark the @entity106 at @entity2 ’s @entity107			1
@entity5 was wearing an exquisite pale pink kimono - style dress			0
it was made especially for her by @entity112 designer @entity111 , and covered with tiny orchids			0
it was an appropriate choice since the couple were being afforded the honour of having an orchid name after them , a purple spotted ‘ @entity119 ’			1
a @entity18 spokesman said the cards were being sent out by the @entity4 and @entity5 ’s correspondence team as the couple had been touched by the number of good wishes they had received			2
the couple ’s first baby , who will be third in line to the throne , is due in july			2
there is much speculation that the @entity5 may be expecting twins because of her age and the acute morning sickness that she experienced in the early stages of pregnancy			0
bookmakers slashed the odds on twins from 50/1 to 8/1 after her hyperemesis gravidarum - a kind of morning sickness - in december			0
no mother of a future monarch has given birth to twins in @entity112 since the 15th century			0
however , under new legislation , if the @entity5 does gives birth to a boy and a girl , it will be the first - born who succeeds – no matter their gender			0
the @entity4 and @entity5 recently went for a @entity156 holiday on the island of @entity158 as a ' babymoon ' break before their baby arrives			0
however , the @entity5 has since been back to her usual duties visiting people around @entity112 , and her schedule has been a busy one			0
most recently she was seen this month at @entity166 , a 23 - bed treatment centre in @entity168 , south - west @entity67 , run by @entity169 , a charity of which she is patron .			0

wellwishers for the @entity173 are being treated to thank you letters
the cover of the card is a picture of the couple in @entity2
