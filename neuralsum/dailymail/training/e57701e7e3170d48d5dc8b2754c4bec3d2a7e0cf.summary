by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:22 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 18:19 est , 9 april 2013 forfeit : sir @entity2 today offered to give up 30 per cent of his £ 700,000 - a - year pension the disgraced boss who was the ' architect ' of the collapse of @entity8 owner @entity6 yesterday became the first man to forfeit his knighthood for more than 60 years			1
in a sensational admission of guilt , sir @entity2 said he was ' deeply sorry ' for the disaster that unfolded at the banking giant after he left in 2006			1
it comes after a damning report by the @entity17 on @entity18 last week singled him out as ' the architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster ' and savaged his ' reckless incompetence ' as chief executive			0
the 57 - year - old has also offered to forfeit 30 per cent of his gold - plated pension of £ 580,000 a year every year until he dies			1
this is equal to around £ 175,000 , which he hopes will be given to a charity or the shareholders of @entity32 – which controversially rescued @entity6 in 2009 – whose nest eggs have been decimated			1
in a final humiliation he was last night forced to quit his £ 125,000 - a - year job as a senior independent director of the catering giant @entity38 , having already lost two other major roles in the wake of the scandal			1
sir @entity1 , whose knighthood was awarded under @entity43 in 2006 for ' services to the finance industry ' , said he believed ' it is right that i should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal '			2
last night , there were calls for other bankers to follow his lead by either forfeiting their knighthoods or sacrificing a part of their pensions built up during their reckless leaderships			0
@entity62 , the @entity63 mp who sits on the @entity64 , said the move is ' highly appropriate ' , adding : ' this sets the benchmark for others			0
' at last , we have a banker who is prepared to say he got it wrong and wishes to make amends			0
' i hope now that this is not an isolated stance and others will follow his example and give up some of the grandeurs of power and pension benefits that they have gained on the back of poor leadership of the banks			2
' sir @entity1 was among three @entity6 chiefs who were savaged over their ' catastrophic failures of management ' by the @entity89			1
' chastening ' : sir @entity1 , pictured giving evidence to the @entity64 admitted that the @entity17 report made for ' very chastening reading ' country pile : sir @entity2 's large home near @entity95			1
he has offered to surrender 30 per cent of his £ 580,000 - a - year pension pot he was singled out as one of the leaders who steered the bank to the brink of collapse – saddling taxpayers with a £ 28billion bill to bail it out			1
the report said the former bosses ' ' high - risk ' strategy , ' reckless lending ' and ' deluded ' leadership all contributed to the disaster – yet all three have since moved on to lucrative positions in the @entity113			2
in a heartfelt statement yesterday , sir @entity1 said the report had made ' very chastening reading '			2
he offered his ' sincere regret for events ' and added : ' i am deeply sorry for what happened at @entity6 and the ensuing consequences for former colleagues , shareholders , taxpayers and society in general			1
' under investigation : former @entity6 chief executive @entity127 and ex-chairman @entity128 who could potentially face being barred from working as company directors for life banking disaster : former @entity6 chief executive sir @entity2 was heavily criticised in the @entity17 last friday a friend of sir @entity1 said last night : ' he saw the newspapers and decided he did n't want to become part of a @entity137 - style witch - hunt			1
' he wanted to be able to meet friends and business acquaintances in the eye and know he 'd done the right thing			0
' it marks a dramatic fall from grace for a man who was known as former prime minister @entity147 's favourite banker			0
pension pot : sir @entity149 has built up a pension pot worth an estimated £ 25million renouncing a knighthood after accepting it is almost unheard of			1
it is thought the last time it happened was in 1948 when an @entity157 lawyer and politician called @entity159 ( pictured ) renounced his following @entity157 independence			2
the year before , the @entity161 had renounced his knighthood on the grounds it was not in keeping with the ideals of @entity165 @entity157			2
in 1969 @entity166 returned an mbe he received in 1965 in protest over @entity170 ’s involvement in @entity171			0
if an honour is to be taken away , evidence is put to the shadowy @entity174 , a group of senior civil servants			0
their recommendation goes via the prime minister to the queen who makes her decision			0
a notice is then published in the @entity181 that the honour has been forfeited			0
the process can take weeks or months			0
but anyone writing directly to the @entity174 to tell them they are returning an honour is likely to see their case dealt with slightly faster , a source said			0
he lost his lucrative high - profile job at @entity191 , the private equity firm , and his trusteeship of the charity @entity193 in the wake of the damning report			0
but he will still enjoy a pension of around £ 400,000 a year			1
@entity197 , the @entity199 mp and a senior member of the @entity64 , said sir @entity1 's move was ' better late than never '			0
he said : ' frankly , the relinquishing of 30 per cent of his pension is a highly arbitrary figure			0
it still sees this walking advertisement for corporate incompetence taking home over £ 400,000 in pension every year until he dies			2
' sir @entity1 's contrite behaviour is in sharp contrast to the lack of any public displays of regret by mr @entity137 , the former chief executive of @entity215			2
he had to be stripped of his knighthood by the @entity217 and agreed to forfeit part of his pension only after a long and bitter campaign , although it is still worth £ 342,500 a year			1
mr @entity62 said the man who replaced sir @entity1 as @entity6 chief executive in july 2006 – @entity127 – and its former chairman , @entity128 , should be in the firing line			2
when mr @entity127 , now 46 , left the bank in disgrace three years later , his pension was worth £ 240,000 a year			1
pension experts said it is likely to be worth around £ 320,000 a year when he reaches 50 and can start claiming it			1
an ordinary saver would have to build up a pension pot of around £ 11million to generate the same pension income , according to financial advisers @entity234			1
mr @entity127 has received the ' complete backing ' of bookmaker coral , where he receives a package of more than £ 500,000 as chief executive			0
@entity128 has also received the support of bookseller @entity240 where he is an independent director .			0

sir @entity2 has a pension pot worth an estimated £ 25million or £ 580,000 - a - year
he said he was ' deeply sorry ' for what happened at @entity6
@entity215 needed a £ *20.5billion* taxpayer - *funded* bailout in 2008
