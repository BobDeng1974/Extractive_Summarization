these mascots stick together do n't they ! @entity126 at the @entity127 : you get the feeling the next goal will decide this one			0
@entity5 were by far the better side for the remainder of the opening half following @entity87 ’s early breakthrough			1
they ’re bright on the ball , the man in possession always has an option and , in @entity142 and @entity143 , they boast a front pair not afraid to take aim			0

@entity126 from the @entity127 : 6 mins - @entity159 said @entity2 could do with an early goal and that ’s exactly what they ’ve got			1
@entity5 goalkeeper @entity190 was their hero seven days ago but he hardly covered himself in glory with the hesitancy which allowed @entity87 to steal in for an easy opener			1
this tie is still level , remember , and @entity2 will need at least one more before they ’re planning trips to the @entity198			0
11 mins : @entity163 fires the ball straight down the middle but @entity49 , called into action immediately after coming on to replace @entity175 , saves with his leg			2

@entity239 and @entity241 's @entity240 will also compete in this season 's tournament following their elimination from the @entity245 via the play - offs this week			0
as it 's @entity2 's maiden voyage into @entity1 , supporters wo n't be too fussy about who the @entity3 line up against should they progress this evening			2
