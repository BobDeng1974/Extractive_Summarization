by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 01:30 est , 12 june 2013 character : sir @entity2 , one of the greatest racehorse trainers of all time died yesterday at the age of 70 @entity7 the two figures — one very tall and elegant , the other diminutive and stocky — walked stiffly across the paddock to the horse that one had trained and the other was about to ride in the big race			1
all around them at @entity15 races there were tense and almost disbelieving faces as the trainer gave his jockey a routine ‘ leg - up ’ into the saddle			2
this was a very different kind of race - day tension , one that even in the libidinous , hot ‑ breath world of horses and riders , @entity24 and @entity25 might have had difficulty describing			1
for the gossip had spread like a hot race tip : everyone knew that just a few hours earlier , the trainer , the elegant aristocrat @entity2 , had terminated the contract of his stable jockey @entity36 , son of an @entity38 plasterer , for sleeping with his wife @entity39 after romping in a shower — a claim the jockey has always vehemently denied			1
it was too late to change riders , though			0
yesterday sir @entity2 died of cancer at the age of 70 , bringing to a close a life marked almost as much by scandal as by his achievements as one of the greatest racehorse trainers the sport of kings has ever known			1
‘ good with fillies , ’ was the running joke in the racing world , for @entity2 , something of a dandy , was himself no innocent when it came to illicit relationships			1
in recent times he trained the extraordinary @entity61 , owned by @entity62 of @entity63 , to win 14 races without defeat			1
dying of stomach cancer , and very weak , @entity2 lived to see this unique stallion proclaimed the finest racehorse in the world			1
friends are convinced that the chain - smoking dandy in colourful waistcoats and @entity73 loafers ( who would sometimes give his handmade shirts away at the end of the season to more needy racing folk ) was sustained through his illness by the thrill of working with the best horse anyone had seen in his lifetime			1
with wife number one : sir @entity2 's first marriage was to @entity87 , the daughter of another racehorse trainer sir @entity88 @entity2 had been at the top — but he ’d also been almost to the bottom and close to bankruptcy			1
he never lost faith in himself , though : he said that utter self - confidence was the only thing he was good at			2
before horses , he ’d never thrived at anything , even failing the entrance exam to @entity98			0
his father , younger brother of the 3rd @entity100 of @entity101 , was killed in action in @entity103 , and @entity2 was still a baby when his widowed 27 - year - old mother married the famous trainer sir @entity105 , who was 57			1
until then sir @entity2 , who trained the @entity107 ’s horses , had been viewed as a confirmed bachelor , but he set about teaching his stepson everything he could about training horses			1
it was a profession that was to lead @entity2 into a series of extraordinary social scandals			1
at first , it seemed like the perfect racing partnership when @entity2 married @entity87 , daughter of another knighted trainer of the post-war years , sir @entity88			1
sir @entity88 ’s wedding gift to them was @entity121 , his famous racing establishment on the edge of @entity124			2
with wife number two : sir @entity2 married second wife @entity39 when she was aged 23 and he was 48 and it was not long before @entity2 was training the first of his 25 classic winners — including four @entity129 — and attracting the richest and most ambitious owners			1
among them was the most ambitious of them all , @entity134 ’s fabulously wealthy sheikh @entity133			0
by the @entity135 , @entity2 and @entity87 had been married some 23 years and had a son and a daughter			1
that was when @entity139 , the daughter of a doctor , arrived in his life			2
it was at the staff @entity143 in 1989 that the languorously good - looking @entity2 and the pretty @entity39 , always so fetching in her breeches , got talking over a glass of wine			1
she was running a breaking yard for young horses near @entity124 and @entity2 took his yearlings to her			1
the following spring he took her to the horse sales			2
by the end of the year , his 24 - year marriage to @entity87 had been dissolved			2
incredibly , and with astonishing loyalty to owners such as sheik @entity133 — who would have been mortified for @entity121 to be broken up in a division of marital property — it was @entity87 who agreed to move out of the home where she had grown up			0
she started a training establishment of her own in @entity124			0
@entity2 ’s head lad @entity166 , meanwhile , was so disgusted by the goings - on that he left			1
wife number three : @entity169 was sir @entity2 's secretary before they married five years ago @entity2 had already been champion trainer nine times by then			1
he would win that title only once more , in 1993			0
the previous year , aged 48 , he had married 23 - year - old @entity39			2
and with her arrival , things had changed at the yard considered to be the ‘ pinnacle of @entity179 racing ’			0
no one objected when the new mrs @entity181 redecorated @entity121 to her own taste , but other things were being changed , such as the type of food the horses were getting			0
sheik @entity133 grew increasingly unhappy , so much so that in 1995 he removed all 40 of his horses that were in training with @entity2 — a major blow			1
a story was put out that he was angry because he had n’t been told that one of his horses was injured , but another version was that the trainer ’s wife was interfering , and the @entity133 — the biggest owner in @entity179 — refused to put up with it			0
it was a hammer - blow to @entity2 , who had to build up his reputation all over again			1
he had n’t lost his talent , and he had other wealthy owners , but his image was damaged			0
a year later , the tough and personable @entity38 jockey @entity36 arrived to work for @entity2 , and was soon riding winners and was proclaimed champion jockey			1
not surprisingly , after the @entity133 ’s sudden departure , @entity181 ’s new - found influence with the horses was much diminished			0
as @entity2 concentrated on re-establishing himself as the best in the business , the marriage began to disintegrate			2
passed away : sir @entity2 , who trained @entity61 during his glittering career , has died age 70 success : @entity2 in 2011 with horse @entity61 and jockey @entity214 after winning the @entity215 within the intimate horsey fraternity of the racing town , some people , especially old friends of @entity2 ’s former wife @entity87 , had always been hostile to @entity39			1
now , they could be openly aggressive			0
@entity2 ’s response was not to remonstrate with his old friends and racing colleagues , but to tell his new wife that she ‘ had to earn their respect ’			1
she began drinking and putting on weight , then fought the resulting depression with more alcohol , diet pills and @entity233			0
it was on a visit to @entity236 to look at some horses in 1999 that she had a one - night stand with someone she later described as ‘ a leading jockey ’			0
until then , she said : ‘ i had been 100 per cent faithful			0
i met someone who made me laugh ... one thing led to another			0
’ they had sex in a shower and more sex in the bedroom			0
to her dismay and @entity2 ’s mortification , the story found its way — via a friend in whom she had confided — on to the front page of the @entity258			2
the following day , @entity2 sacked @entity36 for unspecified ‘ personal reasons ’ , though @entity260 denied he was the jockey involved			2
record breaker : @entity2 , pictured with the @entity107 in 1985 , has the most winners at @entity263 honoured : @entity2 was knighted in 2011 for services to horse racing as for @entity39 , she said : ‘ i ’ll always regret it because i had let myself down			1
i told @entity2 what had happened before the article appeared			2
he was understanding and said : “ we do these things when we are low			0
” ’ @entity2 must have been pretty low himself when , some time after this , he paid a prostitute called @entity275 £ 800 to spend the night with him at the @entity276 in @entity277			2
and , yes , this also made the front page of the @entity258			0
@entity39 , fighting her addictions in @entity283 clinic in @entity284 at the time , was shown the newspaper by a fellow patient			0
then @entity2 arrived , carrying a teddy and hoping in vain for a reconciliation			2
she had a few words with him — ‘ a few loud words ’			0
he issued a statement admitting being with miss @entity275 all night , but denying they ‘ had sex ’			0
couple : but @entity2 divorced second wife @entity39 after mutual allegations of infidelity it was all so very messy and , for his friends , so disappointing that the seamier side of this genial and generous man should overshadow his genius with horses			2
there are various theories about why his career slumped to crisis level after the turn of the century , when he slipped out of fashion with some of the newer owners			0
some say they simply went for younger trainers ; others insist @entity2 was seen by many as ‘ soiled goods ’			1
his yard , once filled with 200 racehorses , was down to just 50 and he had difficulty making ends meet			0
one important owner stood by him through thick and thin			0
this was prince @entity324 , a highly dignified man			0
among the horses he gave him to train was one called @entity61 , who turned out to be a wonder horse			1
and , in 2011 , in the @entity330 , @entity2 was knighted			2
sir @entity2 ’s climb back to the top began before @entity61 , however			1
friends believe it had much to do with the support of his third wife , @entity169 , who was his secretary before they married five years ago			0
so what happened to the others ? first wife @entity87 has retired from training and still lives in @entity124			0
@entity39 , who has never confirmed the identity of her one - night - stand ‘ leading jockey ’ , now lives quietly in @entity343			0
@entity36 took legal action against @entity2 and in an out - of - court settlement is understood to have got £ 200,000 for loss of earnings			1
as for that horse @entity260 rode that day at @entity15 when he and @entity2 stood side by side for the last time — it came nowhere			1
at home : the trainer in his garden in @entity124 in 2011 , as he was battling cancer			0

@entity2 was one of the most successful trainers in racing 's history
endured hard times amidst sex scandals and drink - driving *conviction*
but *rebuilt* his life and trained @entity61 , *officially* named world 's best horse
