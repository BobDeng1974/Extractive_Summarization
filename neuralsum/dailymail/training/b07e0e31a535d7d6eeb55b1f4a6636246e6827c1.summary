former @entity4 leader @entity2 insisted he was a ‘ passionate ’ @entity13 and still hoped that @entity6 would one day join the euro single currency			1
and he revealed he had told mr @entity10 that he believed a referendum was inevitable after @entity16 wielded the @entity6 veto to block an @entity7 treaty change in december last year			1
‘ we were now irretrievably on the way to a @entity13 referendum , ’ @entity2 said today			1
the admission is likely to be seized on by @entity23 in the @entity25 party who have repeatedly called for mr @entity16 to commit to holding a vote			0
however , @entity2 beleives the @entity6 public would not vote to abandon @entity28 : ‘ provided we have that referendum on in or out , it can be won			1
’ @entity2 was speaking at a fringe event at the @entity4 conference in @entity32 , where he warned the currency crisis meant future shape of @entity13 was not yet clear			1

‘ i am a passionate @entity13			0
we have to be passionate			0
as @entity13 moves , as it must , towards deeper federalism … this is a dance we have to sit aside from			0
' we need to do it with apologies and regret but the @entity25 will do it with scorn			0
‘ if it should ever become in @entity6 ’s interests to join the @entity13 , , i am in favour of us doing so			2

former @entity4 leader says @entity16 *'s* @entity7 veto set @entity6 ' irretrievably ' on course for a referendum
@entity2 predicts a *smaller* @entity51 - but the @entity6 should still join eventually
