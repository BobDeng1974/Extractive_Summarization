not terrorists : the @entity18 of the @entity4 has ruled that @entity2 can no longer be included on the @entity4 's terrorist list as the process which saw it put on the list in 2001 was flawed @entity23 members of @entity24 , the armed wing of the @entity2 movement , descend while being harnessed to zip lines as smoke engulfs a building during a military parade marking the 27th anniversary of @entity2 ' founding , in @entity32 on sunday deputy @entity2 chief @entity33 said the @entity4 court 's ruling is is a correction of a historical mistake the @entity4 had made ' the @entity4 continues to consider @entity2 a terrorist organisation , ' @entity40 spokeswoman @entity39 said today , adding that the @entity4 will consider its response to the ruling			1
the @entity18 of the @entity4 , the bloc 's second highest tribunal located in @entity45 , said @entity4 member states could maintain their freeze on @entity2 's assets for three months , to give time for further review or to appeal the verdict			0

' we are not satisfied with the @entity4 's explanation that the removal of @entity2 from its list of terrorist organisations is a ' technical matter ' , ' @entity52 said in a statement from @entity62 today			2
' we expect it ( the @entity4 ) to put @entity2 back on the list forthwith given that it is understood by all that @entity2 -- a murderous terrorist organisation , the covenant of which specifies the destruction of @entity53 as its goal -- is an inseparable part of this list , ' he said			1
conflict : the @entity4 has said it still considers @entity2 ( pictured ) to be a terrorist group , despite the court 's verdict , and may appeal to have it put back on the list not in the clear : @entity4 member states can maintain their freeze on @entity2 's assets for three months , to give time for further review or to appeal the verdict , the court ruled celebration : members of @entity24 , the armed wing of the @entity2 movement , take part in a military parade marking the 27th anniversary of @entity2 founding on sunday @entity53 's protests were unsurprisingly followed by cheers from @entity2 in the @entity91 , as representatives welcomed the verdict			1

the @entity4 court did not consider the merits of whether @entity2 should be classified as a terror group , but reviewed the original decision - making process			2
this , it said , did not include the considered opinion of competent authorities , but rather relied on media and @entity114 reports			0
' the court stresses that those annulments , on fundamental procedural grounds , do not imply any substantive assessment of the question of the classification of @entity2 as a terrorist group , ' the court said in a statement			2
it added that if an appeal was brought before the @entity4 's top court , the @entity126 , the freeze of @entity2 funds should continue until the legal process was complete			2
appeals , which can only be based on points of law , may be brought within two months			0
