she later uploaded the photographs , which were taken without the permission of church officials , onto a website used by punters looking for an escort			0
local vicars described the photo shoot in @entity31 - listed @entity7 's @entity30 in @entity8 , @entity9 as ' shameless ' and suggested that it would upset believers			1
@entity4 , who claims to be from nearby @entity34 , says on her online profile that she charges £ 120 an hour for ' domination and sensual fetish sessions '			2
at least two of the pictures she uses to tout her wares were taken at 12th - century @entity7 's , which is no longer used for services but is open to worshippers under the care of the @entity44			2
reverend @entity45 , vicar of @entity47 & @entity48 church in @entity49 near @entity50 , criticised the woman 's decision to use a place of worship for her escorting activities			1
' although @entity57 made the human body a beautiful thing , there is a time and a place for it , ' he said			1
' i think this is just sad this young lady has decided to use the church - which is a big part of the community , as it houses the post office - in this manner			0
' it 's a place of joy and worship			2
surely there 's a better way of meeting people			0
' historic : the 12th - century church no longer hosts services but is still open to @entity12 worshippers ' shameless ' : the pictures were posted on an escorts ' website in an attempt to drum up business reverend @entity85 , of @entity87 's church in @entity88 , added : ' the pictures show the loss of the sense of sacred we have in society in general			1
' i think it ’s not on really and it ’s something i deplore			0
i think the whole thing is shameless and shows no consideration for those who may have walked past and seen it by accident			0
' there are those who will be repulsed by the sacrilegious side of it			0
' a spokesman for the @entity44 said : ' we ’re very sorry to hear pictures of this nature have been taken at our church without our permission			2
' our churches are open to all as heritage attractions and places of peace and calm , we expect visitors to treat the buildings with the respect they deserve , as well as being respectful of the local community and their use of these buildings			0
