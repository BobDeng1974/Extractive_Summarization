by @entity0 published : 05:18 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 7 february 2013 a south @entity2 man has become the first person in the world to be convicted of killing a great white shark after he hooked one while fishing from the shore			1
@entity7 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , pleaded guilty to contravention of the @entity11 which includes attempting to kill , disturb or be in possession of a white shark without a permit			1
@entity7 pointed out that he had no idea at first that he 'd hooked a great white shark but he pleaded guilty so as not to waste the court 's time			1
catch : fisherman @entity7 poses with the great white shark he caught off the @entity2 coast but in a landmark decision @entity21 handed him a fine of @entity24 , 000 ( £ 8,550 ) or a 12 - month prison sentence , suspended for five years			1
the unprecedented case is the only great white shark conviction in a @entity2 court to date - the first country to impose legislation in protecting great white sharks			1
great white sharks have been protected in @entity2 waters since 1991 and no person is permitted to catch them , or even to attempt to catch them			2
penalty : in a landmark ruling , @entity7 was fined £ 8,500 under the @entity11 but for years anglers who landed the sharks were able to successfully argue that they had not been targeting great whites			1
environmentalists believe the ruling sets a new precedent in that anyone using heavy - duty fishing tackle in an area where white sharks are known to inhabit is effectively breaking the law			1
shark scientist @entity50 , who appeared as an expert witness in the case , welcomed the verdict			2
he told the @entity54 : ' a lot of law enforcement officers were reluctant to prosecute because they knew it was difficult to prove the anglers had targeted white sharks			2
' this prosecutor analysed the law and said as anglers fishing with heavy equipment in an area known for white sharks , they would have a reasonable expectation of catching great white sharks , and so just by fishing with that equipment in that area they are in effect breaking the law			1
' photographs of @entity7 giving a thumbs - up sign after hauling the shark onto the rocks , sparked an angry outcry after they were published in the paper two years ago			1
however photographs of anglers posing with dead great whites are not uncommon and there is an on - going illegal trade in great white shark body parts such as jaws , which fetch a very high price			2
@entity88 spokesman @entity87 said : ' this is the first great white shark case and conviction in any @entity2 court			2
we are certain that the sentence will serve as a deterrent			2
' @entity7 pleaded guilty saying he did not want to waste the court 's time but pointed out he had no idea he 'd hooked a great white shark at the time although great white sharks have been protected in @entity2 since 1991 , there is evidence to suggest that they continue to be targeted by recreational fisherman as a trophy species the @entity105 welcomed the ruling			1
spokesman dr @entity107 said : ' this is the first legal case , and conviction , around the catching of a white shark in @entity2			0
' for authorities to take such clear action is an excellent indication of their commitment to upholding protected species status			0
' the not inconsiderable sentencing of @entity7 will hopefully be a deterrent to these practices in @entity2			1
as far as i am aware , this is also a world first in terms of prosecution for harming a white shark			0
' the great white was caught on the shore near the city of @entity127 on @entity2 's @entity9 anger : photographs of @entity7 hauling the shark onto the rocks , sparked an outcry in @entity2 after they were published two years ago no person is allowed to trade in , or have possession of any parts of a white shark , even their teeth , without a permit			1
in @entity145 , while @entity141 are also protected species in @entity144 waters , legislators have recently approved a plan to kill sharks that venture too close to people in the water			0
there were five fatal shark attacks in @entity145 in the past year , with many residents calling for a more aggressive shark management plan			0
@entity2 sees it 's fair share of great white attacks			0
one particular hotspot is @entity160 's @entity159 beach which has seen three attacks in the last eight years			0
hot spot : @entity160 's @entity159 beach has seen three attacks in the last eight years in september last year , @entity164 tourist @entity163 was attacked with a shark biting off his right leg above the knee and part of his left leg			0
that followed two fatal attacks including that of @entity174 tourist @entity173 who was pulled undewater and dragged out to sea in 2010			0
only his diving goggles were found			0
and in november 2004 , a 77 - year - old @entity178 , was attacked and killed by a shark while doing the backstroke			0
city officials are now considering installing a 355 - metre long net across a stretch of the beach to create a safe swimming area .			0
