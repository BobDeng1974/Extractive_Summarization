by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:33 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 29 november 2013 a cousin of @entity3 has arrived in court to sue his family for 25 years of income from their @entity8 estate			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , 50 , second cousin of the prime minister 's wife , claims he has not received any money from his late grandfather 's 1,000 - acre property despite being granted a 25 per cent stake in 1983			1
now , five years after the death of his grandfather , son of the sixth baronet of @entity23 , the @entity18 is suing his father @entity24 for a quarter of a century 's worth of rent , farm yields and shooting rights fees			1
battle : @entity11 , left , is suing has taken his father @entity24 , right , to court for 25 years ' worth of income @entity32 in @entity8 on 1,000 - acre estate at the centre of the row between the aristocratic @entity11 family mr @entity11 , who like @entity3 is a great - grandchild of the sixth baronet , is also suing the executors of his grandfather 's estate and the trustees of the agreement made in 1968 when it was established			1
@entity43 , representing his father , @entity44 , told the court that @entity11 has ' gradually cut himself off from his family ' over the past 18 years , believing his parents were ' responsible for physical abuse he believes he suffered at the hands of one of his nannies '			2
the estate was established by @entity11 ’s grandfather - @entity53 - in 1968 ' in the fervent wish ' that @entity24 and his heirs ' would continue to own and look after the estate for future generations ' , the court heard			1
mr @entity11 , who died aged 95 in 2008 , was the youngest son of the sixth baronet of @entity23 , who ' rescued the family fortunes ' after the @entity60 were threatened by crippling death duties following @entity62			1
@entity24 , now 74 , followed his father into bank notes manufacturing business , portals , where he later became chairman , and is now facing his own son across a tense courtroom			0
family feud : @entity3 's second cousin is suing his father in a feud over a @entity8 estate during an enormously costly 10 - day trial mr @entity74 insisted that @entity24 and his father had acted in good faith throughout and that @entity11 had always understood that his share in the family trust that holds the estate was given to him by his grandfather in 1983 ' as part of succession and tax planning '			1
' the ( family ) understood @entity11 and his grandfather had reached an understanding at the time of the gift that @entity11 would allow his grandfather to receive all the income from the estate while he was alive , ' said the @entity93			1
' they understood that his grandfather and his wife would continue to occupy their home at @entity99 , on the estate , and generally he would be treated during his lifetime as if he was still the owner '			0
' @entity11 says nobody told him his rights , ' said mr @entity74 , but the barrister argued that the astute economics graduate ' was party to the gift and knew and understood what he was signing '			0
there was , in any case , ' no dispute ' that the estate ’s trustees are ' bound to account ' to @entity11 in respect of his 25 percent share from may 2008 - the date of his grandfather ’s death , said mr @entity74			1
@entity24 insisted in court that his son had been well aware of the true position , adding that he was in line to receive ' a huge benefit - because he would ultimately own 25 per cent of a valuable estate '			2
father and son sat in court just yards apart - separated by a document - strewn desk			0
two of @entity11 ’s siblings - @entity131 and @entity132 - also stepped into the witness box to back their father ’s account			0
mrs @entity132 , 40 , recounted a conversation with her grandfather , when she was aged 16 , in which he ' told me he was passing on his interest in the estate to @entity11 but that he was to keep all the income until he died '			1
' i remember thinking how lovely it was that @entity11 - who at the time was a lovely person and full of life and a great older brother - that the estate would be passed onto the next generation through him , ' she told the court			2
@entity11 ( 1648 - 1721 ) , the first @entity149 , whose heirs include @entity3 and @entity11 , who is now suing his family in a claim that could run into millions mrs @entity132 , who described her grandfather as a ' wonderful man ' , said he had told her his plan because he ' wanted to share it with me '			1
@entity11 had for years accepted the status quo without demur , claimed mr @entity74 , and his father had described him as ' everything we could have wished for in an eldest son '			0
however , by the end of the 1990s , family relations were becomingly increasingly strained , the court heard , prompting group therapy sessions ' in an attempt to reconcile the family ’ relationship with @entity11 '			0
the family had also made ' strenuous efforts ' to mediate the dispute before reaching court , but without success , said mr @entity74			0
the dispute has its origins in 2005 when @entity11 first challenged his father and grandfather about his entitlement to a quarter share of the estate ’s income			2
@entity11 ’s @entity93 , @entity182 , said it was never spelt out in 1983 that his grandfather was retaining his right to income from the estate			2
' the point of the trust is to effect a gift			0
there was no word about reserving for @entity11 ’s grandfather a life interest in the income of that trust , ' he said			2
' although they knew that the gift was made and , indeed , intended the gift to be made , they did n’t follow it through and give effect to the rights that the gift gave to @entity11			0
' the barrister said that , having gifted @entity11 his 25 percent share , but with his grandfather still needing income from the estate , the trustees were left having to ' square the circle '			1
he added : ' what they actually did was ignore @entity11 from thenceforth			0
' judge @entity212 has now reserved his ruling on the case			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
