' @entity13 responded by branding @entity11 's claims ' demonstrably false ' before the judge threw the case out of court			1

' the website goes on : ' the three bedroom , two bathroom condo was renovated in 2008 and boasts luxury finishes , a parking space , a balcony , and access to a landscaped private garden complete with a remote - control hot tub			0
' the dispute allegedly began in june last year when @entity13 entered the property to repair a bathroom and discovered his tenant had painter a wall without permission			1
when he then went onto the balcony to inspect repairs made to the hot tub			0
high flyer : @entity11 is taxi firm @entity2 's senior vice president two months later , @entity11 confronted a female gardener with a baseball bat in the belief she was an intruder , before writing an email to @entity80 stating : ' you provided no notice for this â€¦ if this happens again , i will be forced to call the police			1
' he later threatened to reveal @entity13 's perceived transgressions to his ' tens of thousands of social media followers '			2

@entity11 said he had suffered ' immense stress ' , adding : ' i am entitled to the sanctity of my own home			2
' @entity13 responded by denying that anybody had regularly entered the apartment and that @entity11 had lied under oath			1
the judge dismissed the case with prejudice			1
' having listened to all of the evidence , i 'm finding that this is a borderline frivolous case , ' he said , according to the court transcript			0
' it does n't even come close to meeting the statutory standards of by clear and convincing evidence			0
' it did not end there			0
a furious email exchange ensued			1
' parts of their correspondence were available in public documents filed with the superior court and rent board , ' said @entity39 , ' while others were provided to @entity39 by @entity122			0
' in one , @entity11 wrote : ' i am so glad that you denied that i have sole and exclusive use of the property			1
it is your typical harassment , retaliation , racist activity that you use with me			0

a spokesperson for the @entity136 said in an email that the ' chief himself will not be getting involved in any civil disputes or civil investigation			0
' in march @entity11 sent @entity13 an email saying : ' i was hoping you were not still dealing with your mental health issues			1
but , i guess given that you are a patent troll and a slumlord , you can not help yourself			0
' @entity148 : it comes after he reportedly proposed looking into journalists ' ' personal lives ' and ' families ' while at a private dinner in @entity156 he was speaking with specific reference to @entity159 ( left ) , editor of @entity160 , who recently wrote about deleting her @entity2 app ( right ) after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in @entity164 @entity13 responded by suggesting @entity11 should start looking for a new apartment , to which @entity11 replied : ' i can stay in the apartment as long as i want , a * * * * * e. regardless , this is good evidence of your intent , racist a * * * * * e. ' the acerbic email exchanges came after @entity11 was forced into a grovelling apology last month for suggesting a plan to spend $ 1million on a team of researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company			1
@entity11 , who made the remarks at a private dinner in @entity181 , said he had dreamed up an eight - man team who would find out about writers ' personal lives and families so that @entity2 could discredit them			1
the sinister scheme was targeted at a particular @entity190 female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged ' sexism and misogyny ' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public			0
a chorus of disapproval aimed at @entity11 prompted a humiliating public apology to @entity159 , the editor of @entity160 , in which he disowned the idea entirely			2
@entity11 posted an apology to @entity159 's @entity202 account , saying : ' i would like to apologize to you directly			2
my comments were wrong and i deeply regret them			0
' neither me [ sic ] nor my company would ever engage in such activities			0
' the remarks will do little to improve @entity2 's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints			2
venue : during the dinner party at @entity181 's @entity217 ( pictured ) , @entity11 was reportedly asked about the firm 's depictions in the press			1
in response , the executive suggested that @entity2 should consider spending ' a million dollars ' of its reported $ 15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists , it is claimed and , indeed , the apology did not stop @entity159 from writing a scathing opinion piece on @entity160 , in which she said the plan was ' like a five - year - old pretending to be @entity231 ' - a reference to @entity234 's scheming politician character in @entity237 series @entity235			1
according to @entity159 , @entity11 also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private , but hung up after she refused to have an off - the - record conversation			2
the dinner party in question was hosted by @entity242 , ex-adviser to @entity244 prime minister @entity243 and consultant for @entity2 @entity11 's plan came up when he was asked about the firm 's negative press coverage			1

the eight - strong hit team would investigate ' your personal lives , your families ' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service , he said			0
@entity11 was especially focused on @entity159 , who also recently accused @entity2 of ' sexism and misogyny ' on her @entity190 website , writing : ' the company simply does n't respect us or prioritize our safety			1
' he reportedly expressed anger over her claims that , responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than @entity2 drivers			2
he said @entity159 should be held ' personally responsible ' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app , and are then sexually assaulted , it is reported contradicting his remarks : he added : ' neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities ' and in reference to a specific claim about @entity159 's personal life , he said @entity2 's dirt - diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others , adding : ' nobody would know it was us			2
' after being confronted about his comments , @entity11 , who has been at @entity2 for more than a year and was previously described as a ' top deal guy ' by founder @entity301 , later apologized in a statement to @entity39 on monday evening , he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor @entity2 's views			1
' the remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what i feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company i am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company 's views or approach , ' he said			0
' they were wrong no matter the circumstance and i regret them			0
' at no point during the dinner did @entity11 suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers			2
an @entity2 spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a ' clear violation of our privacy and data access policies '			2
the event at @entity217 was attended by a number of high - profile figures , including actor @entity335 and publisher @entity336 .			0
