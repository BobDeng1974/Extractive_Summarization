@entity0 are preparing to spend another £ 150million next summer to complete @entity2 's revolution at @entity3			1
the club have already splashed out £ 216.4m on additions to their squad since sir @entity7 retired in the summer of 2013			1
and their @entity9 manager will be handed another war chest in the @entity11 , with potential ' @entity13 ' recruits including @entity15 's @entity14 , @entity17 defender @entity16 , @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity21 's @entity20 and @entity22 of @entity23			1
players out of contract in the next year of two - including @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 - could also be culled			0
we take a look at @entity0 's expensive acquisitions since @entity7 retired and assess how they have performed			1
@entity52 ( @entity53 , september 2013 , £ 27.5m ) when @entity54 arrived as @entity7 's successor in the summer of 2013 , he wanted to make a statement in the transfer market			1
unfortunately , the eleventh - hour signing of @entity52 from his old club @entity53 was pretty underwhelming for @entity0 fans given the top names they were linked to			1
the mop - haired @entity62 struggled and became a convenient scapegoat for the @entity0 fans as the club slumped to a seventh - place finish in the @entity66 and bombed out of the cups			2
@entity52 has shown signs of returning to his old combative self since @entity29 arrived , with his all - action performance in the draw with @entity72 the most impressive so far			1
@entity52 is finally starting to show some form at @entity0 after struggling in his first season @entity75 ( @entity72 , january 2014 , £ 37.1m ) with @entity0 struggling to stand the pace in the @entity66 title race , @entity54 splashed out £ 37m to bring in @entity75 in the january window			1
the @entity79 quickly made a positive impression with his incisive passing and intelligent movement and he scored six goals			0
since @entity29 's arrival , @entity75 has been in and out of the starting line - up , but has impressed when he 's been involved			2
he has scored in matches against @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , suggesting he has an important role to play in the side			0
@entity75 has been consistently excellent for @entity0 since joining from @entity72 last january @entity93 ( @entity94 , june 2014 , £ 29m ) knowing they had to recover lost ground and qualify again for the @entity96 , @entity0 wasted little time in strengthening their squad in the summer			1
the signing of @entity93 , who had been strongly linked with the club 12 months earlier , was completed for £ 29m prior to the @entity100			2
the @entity102 midfielder has shown his class in spells so far this season , either side of a fractured rib that forced him out of a few games , and he was particularly influential against @entity90 this week			0
@entity0 paid @entity94 just under £ 30m for @entity102 midfielder @entity93 @entity109 ( @entity110 , june 2014 , £ 27m ) @entity0 were very keen to buy @entity110 left back @entity109 and paid a pretty penny to bring the teenager to @entity113			1
his start to life at @entity3 was n't the best , suffering a hamstring injury which ruled him out of the first three @entity66 matches of the campaign			0
and he struggled a little to get up to the pace of @entity0 's play initially but has in some matches started to demonstrate the class and capability that has him earmarked as a potentially world class talent			0
unfortunately , his momentum has again been stalled by an ankle ligament injury suffered against @entity130 that will keep him out for up to six weeks			0
@entity109 has struggled with injuries since his arrival from @entity110 in the summer @entity135 ( @entity134 , august 2014 , £ 16m ) knowing @entity0 were in desperate need of some steel at the back , @entity29 brought in @entity140 's versatile defender @entity135 from @entity134 late in the transfer window			1
at first , he looked to be a bit of a liability , struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the @entity66			0
the same could be said of @entity0 's defence as a whole in certain games			0
@entity135 dislocated his shoulder in the @entity113 derby but returned after missing two games and @entity0 are slowly starting to look more composed at the back			2
it 's undeniable that @entity0 are still in need of an experienced centre half to replace @entity156 and @entity157 , who both left in the summer , in the long - term			2
@entity135 was brought in from @entity134 to provide more steel in @entity0 's defence @entity162 ( @entity161 , august 2014 , £ 60m ) the marquee signing of @entity0 's summer , prizing @entity164 away from @entity166 champions @entity161 represented a real coup - though they had to pay a @entity169 record £ 60m to get him			1
the @entity170 has adapted superbly to the demands of the @entity66 , contributing three goals and six assists in his 11 appearances to date			0
some of the trickery and passing produced by @entity164 has been mesmerising and it 's easy to see why @entity178 was so upset when he learned he was leaving @entity161			0
@entity164 looks like being a mainstay at @entity3 for many years to come and is integral to their recovery			0
@entity162 has looked impressive since his @entity169 record signing from @entity161 in the summer @entity183 ( @entity184 , september 2014 , £ 13.8m ) having worked with @entity185 during his time as @entity188 manager , @entity29 was eager to sign him after arriving at @entity3			1
far more than a defensive midfielder , @entity185 offers not only protection for the back line but also plenty of gas going forward			0
but just as he was starting to find his feet , @entity185 fell victim to @entity0 's injury curse			0
he damaged knee ligaments in @entity188 's @entity199 qualifier with @entity200 and will be out for a few weeks yet			0
@entity183 celebrates his goal in @entity0 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity203 back in october @entity204 ( @entity205 , september 2014 , £ 6m loan fee ) the most unexpected signing of @entity0 's summer , @entity204 arrived on a season - long loan from @entity205 on transfer deadline day after they had seen off interest from @entity211			1
@entity0 , who paid a £ 6m loan fee , have the option to sign permanently for another £ 43.5m at the end of the season			2
however , this is now in doubt as @entity0 have serious concerns about @entity204 's fitness - he had just returned from a long lay - off with knee problems - and form ( he has scored just once since joining )			2
@entity204 has scored just once for @entity0 since joining on loan from @entity205 on deadline day			2

@entity0 will spend another £ 150m on signing in summer
@entity2 wants to strengthen his squad in several areas
@entity22 , @entity14 and @entity18 among targets
@entity0 have already spent £ 216m on players since @entity7 retired
this included @entity52 and @entity75 under @entity54
@entity29 has signed @entity93 , @entity109 , @entity135 , @entity162 , @entity183 and @entity204
