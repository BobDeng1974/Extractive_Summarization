by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 4 april 2013 a @entity2 family is celebrating giving birth to rare identical triplets , bringing their family to seven			1
but two weeks after the arrival of their daughters - @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 - on march 19 , @entity6 and @entity7 are still unable to tell the girls apart , so they have devised a nifty plan			1
' everyone has a signature colour , ' @entity6 , from @entity18 , told @entity19			1
' @entity20 for @entity13 , purple for @entity12 and yellow for @entity11 , and they have corresponding outfits			2
' a friend is even getting me non-toxic nail polish for their toenails so that way we know for sure who 's who in the middle of the night or during a bath			2
' bundles of joy : @entity6 and @entity7 show off their identical triplets , @entity13 , @entity12 and @entity11 who 's who ? @entity13 wears pink , @entity12 purple and @entity11 yellow as the parents struggle to tell them apart the babies will remain in intensive care at @entity49 until they have reached certain feeding and weight goals , which doctors believe will be around their original due date of may 10			1
despite being born seven weeks early , they all weighed three pounds and are doing well			2
' we are doing excellently , ' said 34 - year - old @entity6 , who left hospital a week ago			2
' we are overjoyed that every one is so well			2
' the @entity57 , who also have a three - year - old son , @entity59 , and a 17 - month - old daughter , @entity60 , had feared that the story would not be such a happy one			0
peaceful : @entity63 rests at @entity64 on tuesday alongside her sisters nap time : like her sisters , @entity67 weighed over three pounds when she was born 7 weeks early baby steps : @entity11 and her sisters will be able to leave the hospital in several weeks once their weight is up @entity6 found out that she was pregnant with triplets during her eight - week scan			1
she and her husband conceived the babies without the use of fertility treatments			0
' the doctor said , " there 's one ... there 's two ... " i was like , " what ! " , ' she said			0
' i honestly do n't even remember her telling me about the third			0
they were sharing one placenta so we knew they would be identical			1
' the only multiple births on either side of the family are @entity7 's grandmother 's twin sisters			1
after their initial shock subsided , the @entity57 grew concerned about the dangers			0
' they told us the scary statistics , ' she said			0
' we were n't able to celebrate like we were with our other two children			2
i think it really was n't until they were actually born that i could relax			0
' growing : @entity6 and @entity7 already have a three - year - old son , @entity59 , and a 17 - month - old daughter , @entity60			1
@entity6 was on bed rest in hospital for three weeks before they welcomed their little sisters brotherly love : @entity59 was originally overwhelmed by the hospital but ca n't wait to see his sisters again the family is now overjoyed at getting to know the new additions ; @entity6 said that as well as being identical , they 're even alike in personality and take it in turns to have a ' feisty ' day			1
the couple introduced their other children to the babies on @entity124 ; the siblings are only allowed to the intensive care unit of the hospital once due to their own young ages			2
' it was a bit overwhelming for my son , ' @entity6 said of @entity59			0
' he covered his eyes when he saw the babies because there were machines and tubes around			0
' but he thought it was neat that they were n't crying and always talks about going to visit them at the hospital again			0
' the likelihood of having identical triplets is unknown , but some estimates range from one in 60,000 births to one in 200 million			1
delicate : @entity6 has returned home but the girls will remain in intensive care for several more weeks colour code : the family plans on painting the babies ' toenails in the colours to make bath time easier support : the @entity57 said family , friends and neighbors have rallied around to help out obstetrician dr. @entity159 said the @entity57 trio are only the third set of triplets he has seen in his 27 - year career			1
' it is extremely rare to have three babies share the same placentas , ' he said			0
' i 'm so happy for @entity6 and @entity7 that their beautiful new babies are doing well			1
' @entity6 said relatives , neighbours and church friends are waiting at home , keen to help with the babies			0
many have prepared them meals for when they return from long days at the hospital			0
' everyone has been wonderful , ' she said - and the love is paying off			0
' they are all doing very well , ' @entity7 added of his baby girls			1
' they are our one in 200 million babies			1
