most people have only ever seen a scorpion fish in an aquarium			1
unless they dine at @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , where they 'll find the spiny , venomous creature on the menu			0
it 's called trash fish dining , and it 's catching on with chefs around the country searching for fresh ways to fill their menus with sustainable - and delicious - seafood			1
' the fishermen would be like , " this is all trash , junk , " but i said , " i 'll pay fair price for it if you 'll bring it back to the dock , " ' says @entity26 , the restaurant 's executive chef			0
' eat some butter - poached scorpion fish and you 'll swear it 's lobster			1
' alternative ingredients : @entity26 , executive chef at @entity3 holds a fresh sheepshead fish , which is rarely seen on menus , in his kitchen in @entity4 , @entity5 chefs such as @entity26 go beyond the usual recommendation to eat small , lower - food - chain fish like sardines , and instead delve full force into little - known local catches that many anglers regard as nuisance or ' trash ' fish			1

' eat some butter - poached scorpion fish and you 'll swear it 's lobster ' at @entity66 's @entity65 , chef @entity64 serves sea slug , tuna spines and roasted fish heads			1
and at @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , award - winning chefs @entity73 and @entity75 built a ' @entity76 ' around whiting , mackerel and other less desirable species			1
besides introducing the public to lesser - known fish , these top chefs also are promoting a broader concept of how to eat sustainably from the ocean , a concept that conservation experts say could help secure the world 's seafood supply			1
just three fish - shrimp , canned tuna and salmon - account for more than half of all @entity94 seafood consumption , according to the trade association the @entity95			1
new delicacy : sea slugs are making their way onto restaurant menus as chefs use ' trash from the sea ' in face of dwindling stocks ' we have created a system based on demand , rather than on what the oceans supply , ' says @entity110 , a former chef who is now director of @entity112 's @entity111			1
' we 're so busy trying to make salmon sustainable that we forget to ask what 's available			2
' better management of the world 's fisheries also is part of the equation			0
two - thirds of the world 's wild fish come from the coastal waters of just nine countries and the @entity125 , says @entity126 , author of @entity127 and head of the ocean conservation organization @entity129			2
' we have created a system based on demand , rather than on what the oceans supply ' these countries have the legal authority to manage the fisheries off their shores without the hassle of international agreements that govern the high seas and the fish that swim in them - the tuna and other large , popular species			2
the @entity94 , @entity144 and the @entity125 already have viable plans to protect nurseries and manage catch limits , @entity126 says			2
getting the remaining seven countries on board , he says , would double the world 's available seafood by 2050			0
' the oceans can play a very big part in making sure people have healthy and good food to eat between now and 2050 , ' @entity126 says			0

' and consumers have been enthusiastic , chefs say			2
sales of fish at @entity164 have increased 45per cent , @entity26 says			2
top catch : fresh blue crabs are said to taste delicious at @entity65 , customers ca n't get enough of @entity64 's unusual offerings , including steaks of @entity170 , an often 85 - pound creature that is 90per cent edible , and fish heads			1
' if i had salmon heads on the menu they 'd be gone every day , ' he says			0
it 's all about making people comfortable with what they 've never had before			0
' and about getting them to stop thinking of good food as garbage			0
many chefs and conservationists say they appreciate the term ' trash fish ' for its sensationalism , which might grab people 's attention			2
but they bristle at the idea that healthy , abundant animals capable of feeding the world 's growing population - and keeping fishermen in business - would be thought of as disposable			0
' there 's a long tradition of big famous chefs generating excitement around a new dish that people have n't previously eaten , and having that become a high status thing , ' @entity126 says			0
