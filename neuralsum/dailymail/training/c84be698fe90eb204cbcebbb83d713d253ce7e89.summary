by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 11:56 est , 2 october 2012 the @entity4 's butler has denied stealing private correspondence but admitted to betraying the trust of the pontiff , whom he said he loved like a son would his father			1
@entity11 's trial for aggravated theft began today in a @entity14 courtroom , with prosecutors claiming he leaked details of power struggles and corruption from papal documents to a journalist			1
the 46 - year - old has confessed to passing on information , triggering one of the most damaging scandals of pope @entity26 's time in office			1
but he told the court today that he was ' innocent concerning the charge of aggravated theft ' although he felt ' guilty of having betrayed the trust of the @entity4 , whom i love as a son would			1
he says he was kept in a tiny cell at the headquarters of the @entity4 's police force , with the lights on constantly , which he said contributed to his ' psychological depression			1
' he claims the cell he was kept in after his arrest was so narrow he could not stretch out his arms			2
father @entity53 , the @entity14 spokesman , insisted that the size of the cell , and the conditions under which @entity11 was held for just over two months , conformed to international standards			2
explosive revelations : @entity11 said he passed details of power struggles and corruption to journalist @entity61 , pictured , to expose ' evil ' within the @entity62 @entity14 police arrested the father of three after they found a stash of papal papers in his @entity68 home			1
in all , police carted off 82 boxes of papers , though not all of them were papal correspondence			0
prosecutors have quoted him as saying that even though he knew taking the documents was wrong , he felt inspired by the @entity78 ' to bring the church back on the right track			0
' he apparently wanted to expose ' evil and corruption ' , adding : ' i was compelled also by my profound faith and desire that there should be light shed on everything in the church			0
' today is the first time the public have heard from the butler himself about the events that landed him in a @entity14 detention facility on may 23			0
the trial opened over the weekend in an intimate ground - floor room in the @entity14 's courthouse behind @entity97			0
on the opposite wall from where he sat was a photo of @entity26 , his boss , the victim of the alleged crime , and the supreme judge in the case			1
as an absolute monarch , @entity26 has full judicial authority in the @entity68 and can intervene to stop a trial			1
he delegates that power to the three - judge tribunal , but he can pardon @entity11 and most expect he will if there is a conviction			2
judge @entity116 has said he expects the trial to be over in about four more hearings			0
@entity11 faces four years in prison if convicted			0
the @entity4 's private secretary , monsignor @entity120 , said he began having suspicions about @entity11 after he realised three documents that appeared in the journalist 's book could only have come from the office he shared with @entity126			2
other witnesses will include one of the four consecrated women who care for the @entity4 's household , @entity131			0
her testimony could shed light on the deeply private world of the small ' papal family ' who live , eat and pray together with the 85 - year - old leader of the @entity137			1
the @entity4 's entourage returned to @entity139 on monday after spending the summer in the papal retreat of @entity141			0
@entity11 has said he handed the documentation to @entity144 journalist @entity61 , whose book ' his holiness : the secret papers of pope @entity26 ' , was published to great fanfare in may			1
' like father and son ' : @entity11 , right , at the start of the trial in the @entity14 this weekend			2
he denies the charge of aggravated theft but says he feels he has ' betrayed ' the @entity4 an earlier @entity61 book , ' @entity155 , ' was based on a trove of damaging documents from the @entity14 bank			1
' his holiness ' contained dozens of reprinted letters and memos : some showed how wealthy donors scored audiences with the pope after handing over checks for 10,000 euros ; others detailed the questionable relationship between @entity144 and @entity14 politics , particularly concerning the tax - exempt status for church - owned real estate			2
the most damaging letter reproduced in the book was written by the former no. 2 @entity14 administrator to the pope , in which he begged not to be transferred as punishment for exposing alleged corruption			2
the prelate , monsignor @entity181 , is now the @entity14 's @entity182 ambassador			0
' inhumane ' : president of the tribunal @entity185 ( front right ) has ordered the prosecution to investigate the claims of @entity11 ( third left , in grey ) that he was mistreated by police after his arrest on the eve of @entity11 's testimony , @entity61 - who revealed his source after @entity11 confessed - said he hoped the one - time butler would make clear why he betrayed the @entity4 and risked so much to air the @entity14 's dirty laundry			1
' he did it because he saw through his own eyes that there were plots , stories and accusations of corruption , made by important monsignors , unclear relationships between states , ' @entity61 told @entity144 television @entity208 on monday			0
' he thought that by making these dramatic stories known he would help bring about the transparency promised by the holy father			0
