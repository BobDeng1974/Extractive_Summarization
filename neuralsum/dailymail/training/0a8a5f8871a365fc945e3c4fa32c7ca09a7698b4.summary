by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 ’s place in the line - up for the @entity5 at @entity6 on october 18 has been thrown into doubt after @entity9 ’s colt picked up a throat infection			1
the @entity12 - trained four - time group one winner could be re-routed to the @entity14 ’ @entity15 at @entity16 in @entity17 if he is forced to swerve the big mile race on @entity20 champions day which is now a target for sunday ’s @entity23 - trained @entity22 winner @entity24			2
@entity12 , whose @entity25 was second in the @entity26 , said : ‘ it is annoying			0
he is the only horse in the stable affected and has never had a sore throat before			0
his chances of running depend on how long he is on antibiotics			2
’ @entity3 , ridden to victory by @entity33 at @entity34 in july , is in doubt for the @entity5 @entity25 ( right ) on the way to second behind @entity37 in the @entity38 in @entity39 @entity41 ’s @entity22 runner - up could run in the longer @entity42 rather than the @entity43 if he goes to champions day after jockey @entity45 advised upping the colt in distance			1
