in his nerve - wracking video of the nest before he eradicated it , the buzz of hundreds of wasps smashing against the camera is clearly audible while @entity6 ' voice is tense as the scary insects engulf the air			1
millions : @entity6 said there were more than a million wasps in the mound , which was the biggest he 'd ever seen ' i have to be honest with you , i was terrified at one point , ' he told the tv station			1

my heart rate was racing , i had hundreds of them on my veil			0
' eventually the terminator - whose company is called @entity63 , managed to kill the entire nest with a good spray and his own technique , details of which he has n't disclosed			2
miraculously , @entity6 managed to walk away with only a single sting on his chin			2
if anyone else had stumbled across the mound they probably would n't have been so lucky , he said			0
