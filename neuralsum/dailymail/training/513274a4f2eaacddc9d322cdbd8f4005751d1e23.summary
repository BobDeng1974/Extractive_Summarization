under - pressure @entity1 boss @entity0 is desperate for his side to turn their season around against fellow strugglers @entity5 on friday night			1
the @entity6 , who reached the play - offs in the previous two campaigns , have dropped into the relegation zone following a wretched run of just one win from their last 16 matches			2
but facing them will be a @entity5 side in similarly rotten form , having won once in 15 outings to lie just two places and two points above their opponents			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 is hoping his struggling side can turn things around against @entity5 on friday the former @entity24 defender @entity0 said : ' everyone knows it is an important game and everyone knows we need to turn the corner quickly			1
we can start to do that on friday night			1
' the atmosphere has been very positive			0
it 's an important game but i do n't expect anything less from the players than in any other game			0
everyone has to go onto the field to do everything to help win the game			0
' @entity0 is expecting a battle against a side very much in the mould of his opposite number , @entity46			1
' they are a team about which the manager tells you everything			0
the team has the same character as the manager , " he added			0
' he is giving everything he can and they will come here to fight and try to get something from the game			0
we need to win the fight and then hope our quality will win the game			0
' @entity64 striker @entity63 ( right ) holds off @entity1 's @entity65 during the @entity6 ' 3 - 0 loss last saturday while @entity1 slipped to a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity64 last weekend , @entity5 were having an even more miserable afternoon as they crashed 5 - 1 at home to @entity69			1
goalkeeper @entity70 is hoping that humiliation will be a watershed in a disappointing season so far			2
' we were all bitterly disappointed after that game and maybe one or two harsh words were said because that was n't a @entity5 performance in the first half , ' said @entity70			1
' but i 've experienced that sort of thing before , when we suffered heavy home defeats to @entity84 and @entity85 under @entity86 ( @entity87 )			0
on those occasions we knuckled down and bounced back , and with the character in this squad i fully expect us to do the same again			0
' we have the opportunity to put the memories of @entity69 firmly behind us by going to @entity1 in front of the @entity95 cameras and showing what we 're really capable of			1
' i still have n't been on the winning side at their new stadium , so this would be the perfect time to rectify that			2
