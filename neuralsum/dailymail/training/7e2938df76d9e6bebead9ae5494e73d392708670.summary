@entity2 , who is at the start of a three - nation tour of @entity14 , said he will be talking ' in great specificity ' with @entity9 leaders about @entity5 's sudden declaration last month of an air defence zone , including over islands disputed with @entity7			1
' we , the @entity3 , are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the @entity6 , ' @entity2 told reporters in a joint press conference with @entity7 prime minister @entity25			2
' this action has raised regional tension and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculations			0
' tensions in the region are at their highest in years , with @entity9 and @entity7 squaring off over a chain of uninhabited islands in a feud that has some observers warning of the danger of an armed confrontation			1
the @entity3 , bound to @entity11 by a security treaty , is looking on alarmed at the growing chances of limited hostilities between the world 's second largest economy and @entity45 's chief ally in the @entity46			2
observers say rising @entity9 , buoyed by its surging economy , is becoming more confident and the dispute with @entity7 is part of a larger effort to stamp its authority on a region long dominated by the @entity3			2
nerves are particularly frayed after @entity5 's proclamation of an @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , in which it says all aircraft must obey its instructions or risk unspecified ' defensive emergency measures '			0
' this underscores the need for crisis management mechanisms and effective channels of communication between @entity9 and @entity7 to reduce risk of escalation , ' @entity2 told reporters			1
' i will be raising these concerns in great specificity directly when i meet with the @entity9 leadership the day after tomorrow , ' he said			0
and he vowed that the @entity3 , which has a security treaty that compels it to come to @entity7 's aid if it is attacked militarily , would stand by its ally			2
' we will remain steadfast in our alliance 's commitment , ' he said			0
@entity25 has been looking for robust backing over his position that @entity5 is being unreasonable and aggressive			0

@entity9 's new air zone overlaps with an air zone set out by @entity7 and covers the disputed islands he was heartened when @entity3 b - 52 bombers flew into @entity9 's @entity56 just days after it was announced			1
' we ... confirmed that we should not tolerate the attempt by @entity9 to change the status quo unilaterally by force and we will continue to work closely in dealing with the situation based on the strong @entity3 - @entity7 alliance , ' the @entity7 premier said			1
' we reaffirmed that policies and measures , including those on operation of @entity121 ( @entity7 's military ) and @entity3 forces , are not changed and that we will maintain close cooperation			0
' @entity5 's announcement of the @entity56 also provoked anger in @entity127 , which , like @entity11 and @entity45 sent official planes into the zone without notifying @entity9			1
the shared reaction in @entity7 and @entity69 marked a rare moment of harmony in a relationship marked by friction over shared history that hobbles @entity3 attempts to bring its two chief regional allies together			0

some analysts believe the declaration of the zone was a far - sighted move by @entity5 in its campaign to undermine @entity7 's claims to control disputed islands , and ultimately , push the @entity3 out of the @entity174			2
others , however , say it looked more like an over-reach by an administration that did not fully anticipate the vehemence of the reaction			0
