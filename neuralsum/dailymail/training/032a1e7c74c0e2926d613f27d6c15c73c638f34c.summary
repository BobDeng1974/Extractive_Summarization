jellyfish are growing in numbers around the world and cost marine industries millions every year			0
but a @entity5 scientist may have found a way to combat the problem , by producing a killer robot which shreds the fish up and destroys them within seconds			0
the machine called @entity13 ( short for @entity14 ) can kill 900kg of the gelatinous creature in an hour using its deadly propellers			2
according to the website @entity38 , the deadly system then traps the animals in a submerged net before ingesting them through the blades			1
@entity44 , director of the @entity45 at the @entity46 , designed the system so three robots could travel together and act as one			2
he started to think of a way to kill them in 2009 , when the @entity53 marine industry lost an estimated $ 300 million because of the creatures			1
during a test run , one system shredded 900kg of jellyfish in one hour , a sign that the killer robots could provide a way to combat the growing jellyfish population			2
the system , which is cheaper than trapping them in a net , would save millions for marine industries every year and could save lives			1
earlier this year , a five - year - old @entity68 boy died after he was bit by a jellyfish while on holiday with his family in @entity73			0
no return : the creatures are then sucked towards the propellers destroyed : the fish is then shredded to death as it passes through the blades and is pulverised with no trace left finished : the @entity13 then pulverises the rest of the swarm before it continues to search the ocean earlier this week , a large cluster of jellyfish forced one of the world ’s largest nuclear reactors to shut down after it caused a blockage in the pipes			1
@entity92 nuclear plant closed its third reactor for the second time in one weekend after a giant wave of jellyfish clogged the pipes that bring in cool water to the plant 's turbines			1
it was not the first time operators at @entity92 have been forced to close reactors due to jellyfish , and marine biologists say could become more common across the globe			0
@entity107 , a researcher at the @entity108 for the @entity109 said : ' it 's true that there seems to be more and more of these extreme cases of blooming jellyfish			0
‘ but it 's very difficult to say if there are more jellyfish , because there is no historical data			0
’ @entity107 said the biggest problem was that there 's no monitoring of jellyfish in the @entity122 to produce the data that scientists need to figure out how to tackle the issue			0
blocked : the @entity92 nuclear power plant in southeastern @entity127 was closed after jellyfish clogged surrounding pipework issue : marine biologists say jellyfish could become a more common problem acorss the globe after a swarm of the creatures forced a @entity127 power plant to close			1

@entity53 industry lost $ 300m because of gelatinous creatures
can block up nuclear power systems and destroy fishing *businesses*
new system *floats* on water with a propeller attached
hunts for the creatures using @entity151 before trapping and ingesting them
