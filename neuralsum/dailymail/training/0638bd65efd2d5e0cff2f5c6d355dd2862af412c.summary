condition : @entity1 , who was raised as a man called @entity3 , only found out she had both male and female sex organs aged 19 a woman with both male and female sex organs lived as a man for over 40 years because her parents did n't tell her she was born a hermaphrodite for two decades			1
@entity1 has lived almost all her life as a man as her parents hid her intersex medical condition from her until she was 19			1
she underwent surgery as an infant and was brought up as @entity14			1
but after years of mockery at school and assuming that ' everybody 's body looked like hers ' , her parents finally revealed the truth about her condition when she was 19			1
after a short , failed marriage to a woman and a period suffering depression , @entity1 decided to dress as a woman two years ago and now wants to take on a permanent ' female persona '			1
she revealed her condition was kept from her ' for as long as possible ' by her parents on medical advice and because her mother and father ' did n't know any better '			1
she said : ' from being young i have always known i was different			2
i could never quite put my finger on why			2
' a doctor told my mother they should deny me my first birthright , the chance to be a woman , in favour of my second birthright , being a man , ' the doctor said it would be easier to hide my female genitalia than the male one , so knowing no different that is what they did			1
' they were also advised to keep my secret from me and the rest of the world for as long as possible			2
' @entity1 was born in @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , in 1968 to @entity55 and @entity56			1
but , after her delivery , their good news was shattered when a nurse said their new baby daughter also had male genitalia			1
@entity1 was brought up as @entity14 in the family home , in @entity53			1
in 1970 , she and her younger brother @entity65 were taken into care after social workers discovered they had been left alone at the family home			2
she added : ' i had a really feminine sounding voice , but i was never told i was different to anyone else and i assumed everybody ’s body looked like mine			2
' as soon as i got to school i realised i did n’t fit in			2
the boys called me horrible names and the girls thought i was weird			2
@entity78 was a really hard time for me and i never really had a girlfriend			0
she said : ' i had n’t been back long when mum said she was going to share something important with me			0
the condition of being ' intersex ' affects one in every 2,000 births in the @entity100 ( although figures may be much higher ) and there are an estimated 30,000 intersex people in the @entity100			0
there are several known abnormalities that can lead to specific sexual ambiguity			0
so called ' xx male syndrome ' occurs in people who have two x chromosomes - one of which contains a significant amount of genetic material from a y chromosome			2
these people appear to be male , but are , in fact , genetically female			1
typically , they will possess male sex organs , but these will often be underdeveloped			1
they will also often develop breasts and maintain a high - pitched speaking voice			0
in fact , biologists now recognise a host of conditions , both genetic and otherwise , which are labelled under the umbrella term ' intersex ' - which replaces older terms such as ' hermaphrodite '			0
intersex people may be genetically female , but physiologically male			1
some will be true hermaphrodites , producing both eggs and sperm			0
many will have been subjected to ' gender reassignment surgery ' after birth , sometimes successfully , often not			1
' she told me to sit down and she went and fetched my baby book			0
in there were pictures of me as a baby and details of my birth			0
' she started to tell me about the day she gave birth to me and the reaction by the nurse			0
' everything all of a sudden started to make sense			0
my whole life people had sensed i was different			0
' she told me they went with the doctors ’ advice because they did n’t know any better			0
' @entity1 continued to spend her life as a man , working in restaurants and pubs as a kitchen porter			1
for a short period she also married , but the relationship broke up not long after they wed. she found herself sinking into depression and , in a desperate act to feel better , she decided to try dressing as a woman two years ago			1
she said : ' to start off , it was really strange as i had only ever known how to dress as a man			0
but very quickly i realised it was the right thing for me			0
' @entity1 added that even now she struggles for acceptance in her new persona			1
she said : ' i grew up as a boy , which i should n't have because secrets were kept from me			1
' i did n't feel right in men 's clothes so after 41 years i decided to take a challenge and put women 's clothes on			1
' the first dress i wore was a pink dress when i walked to the job centre , a people started to stare and say , ' what an idiot '			0
' but since that year i 've started to wear women 's clothes because i knew i was a real woman			2
' i feel happier than ever now			0
i feel healthy and do n't even look back into my past because i do n't want to remember it			2
' new start : @entity1 , 42 , says she now wants surgery to remove her male genitalia so she can officially become a woman ' but even now , two years on , not everyone accepts me			1
i do a lot of volunteer work and visit the @entity188			0
' many of its members accept me for me and can see how taking on my female persona has made be a more happy and balanced person , while others just want to be nasty all the time			2
' i am now looking into having surgery to remove my male genitalia forever			1
' hopefully , this will enable me to put the past behind me and help me move on and find love			2
' campaigners for intersex groups say there are often public misunderstandings about the condition			0
dr @entity205 , director of the @entity206 , said : ' being intersex is not a lifestyle choice , but a medical condition			0
' @entity1 ’s case is typical of that of an a intersex child who had no idea about their condition			1
' the public often confuse intersex people with those who are transgender because of a lack of understanding			0
' ' discrimination against intersex people is often the unreported abuse of a minority , which has for generations been kept a secret by parents and other family members			0
' gay people are now , rightly so , accepted into society and have a right to live as part of the community			0
intersex people also deserve these same rights			0
' i back @entity1 ’s appeal for people to be more tolerant and hope people realise her condition has been inherited , not chosen			1

@entity1 , 42 , was born with both male and female sex organs but was raised as a boy
she did n't find out she had @entity244 until she was 19
she began dressing as a woman two years ago and now plans gender surgery
