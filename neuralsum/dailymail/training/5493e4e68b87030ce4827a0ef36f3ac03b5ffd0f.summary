even billionaires sometimes struggle to find space to park			0
for @entity4 , that moment came when he tried to moor his £ 1billion yacht @entity5 - the largest in the world at 557ft long			1
the @entity9 tycoon was beaten to the only space in the harbour big enough to moor his giant vessel , @entity5			1
@entity14 battleship : @entity5 , the world 's biggest yacht , owned by @entity9 businessman @entity4 , lies at anchor off the coast of @entity20 , near @entity21 , south - eastern @entity15 @entity22 prince @entity23 bin @entity25 - whose own yacht @entity27 is a mere 265ft long - took the coveted mooring in ‘ @entity29 ’ in @entity20 , in the @entity30			1
prince @entity23 is the world ’s 26th richest man with £ 12.3billion , according to @entity32 , while mr @entity4 is 53rd with a fortune of £ 8.4billion			1
holiday on the @entity34 : @entity9 billionaire @entity4 and girlfriend @entity35 the last space in @entity38 ’s biggest yachting harbour simply was n’t big enough for the two superyachts			2
so the @entity14 owner was left with little option but to drop anchor several hundred feet out at sea - and then travel to his villa on the shore by motorboat			0
mr @entity4 ’s crew had pleaded to be allowed to moor in the harbour , but were told it would be impossible to ‘ squeeze @entity5 in ’ as it was ‘ far too big ’			1
‘ mr @entity4 has a villa in the town , and is , of course , always welcome to disembark with his family , but with a yacht this size it was not possible , ’ a source at the port said yesterday			1
‘ instead @entity5 had to be sailed out to sea and left there			2
’ mr @entity4 , 41 , who has six children with his first wife @entity35 and girlfriend @entity35 , often uses his fleet of luxury boats to ferry his family up and down the @entity34			2
but none has ever compared to @entity5 , which has two swimming pools , two helicopter pads , a dedicated disco hall , around 30 cabins , a mini-submarine , and even a missile defence system			0
beaten : @entity14 - owning oligarch @entity4 's current flagship vessel @entity5 ( pictured ) will be knocked off the top spot by the new boat people carrier : mr @entity4 often uses his fleet of yachts to ferry his family , including his six children , up and down the @entity34 luxury : @entity5 had an initial order cost of £ 300million , but this rose to nearly £ 1billion after all the fixtures and fittings mr @entity4 wanted were added to the boat this port ai n't big enough for the both of us : the super yacht of @entity22 prince @entity89 was already moored in @entity20 preventing @entity4 from parking his vessel it also has armour - plating around @entity4 ’s master suite , bullet - proof windows and a laser system designed to dazzle long - lens photographers			1
fabulous wealth : @entity22 prince @entity23 bin @entity25 when it was ordered the initial cost was estimated at around £ 330million , but by the time mr @entity4 took delivery last year it was spiralling towards the £ 1billion mark because of the extra luxury fittings and security measures			1
prince @entity23 ’s vessel , though smaller , has a fascinating history of its own			0
the boat , which can carry 22 passengers and 31 crew , was built in 1980 and bought by @entity22 billionaire , @entity109 under the name @entity111			2
it featured in the 1983 @entity114 film @entity113 – as ‘ @entity115 ’ – owned by villain @entity116			0
its other owners have included @entity118 , who named it the @entity111			0
prince @entity23 bought the yacht in 1991 , and renamed it @entity111 after his investment company @entity122 , his lucky number 5 and the initials of two of his children			0
the prince is the owner of the @entity128 in @entity129 , and his investment company plans to finance the construction of the world ’s tallest building - the @entity134 - in @entity22			1
@entity20 is the largest yachting harbour in @entity38 with more than 2,000 moorings - but only one spot big enough for @entity5			1
mr @entity4 had applied to @entity20 council three years ago to build his own pontoon at the villa , but the plans were rejected			2
a spokesman for the @entity143 said : ‘ the only space where it could fit is already taken , though there are plans to build another large berth in the coming coming years			0
’ @entity5 was built by the @entity150 shipyard in @entity151 , @entity152 , and delivered to @entity4 last december			2
the oligarch also owns three other mega-yachts , the @entity155 ( 377ft ) , the @entity156 ( 282ft ) and the @entity157 ( 161ft )			0
@entity4 once lent the @entity155 to @entity14 footballers @entity158 and @entity160 as a ‘ bonus ’ for playing well			0
annual running costs for his fleet are around £ 16million including full tanks of petrol at around £ 70,000 per yacht .			0
