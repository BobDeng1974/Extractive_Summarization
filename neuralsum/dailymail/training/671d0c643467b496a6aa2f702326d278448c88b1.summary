plans for the 11 - turbine scheme in sight of the tycoon ’s multi-million pound @entity15 golf resort attracted his wrath , as he fears it will spoil the scenic coastal views			1
but energy minister @entity21 yesterday gave the go - ahead for the @entity23 ( @entity24 ) , which could generate up to @entity25 – enough to power almost half of @entity28 ’s homes			2
anger : @entity30 property mogul @entity1 has pledged to spend ' whatever is necessary ' to stop the building of an offshore windfarm after @entity5 ministers approved the scheme reacting to the news mr @entity1 wrote : ‘ the @entity5 wind farm was conceived by the same mind that released terrorist @entity39			1
’ mr @entity1 – who has faced objections to his golf resort at @entity42 – vowed to spend ‘ whatever is necessary ’ to block the scheme			1
he added : ‘ this was a purely political decision , as dictated by @entity45 , a man whose obsession with obsolete wind technology will destroy the magnificence and beauty of @entity5			1
mr @entity1 claims the 11 - turbine scheme will spoil the scenic coastal views ‘ likewise , tourism , @entity5 ’s biggest industry , will be ruined			2
‘ we will spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed			2
‘ all over the world they are being abandoned , but in @entity5 they are being built			0
we will put our future plans in @entity28 on hold , as will many others , until this ridiculous proposal is defeated			0
‘ likewise , we will be bringing a lawsuit within the allocated period of time to stop what will definitely be the destruction of @entity28 and @entity5 itself			0
’ the @entity71 has claimed that the development , which will lie 1.25 - 2.8 miles off the coast , will be capable of generating enough energy to meet the needs of 49,000 homes , almost half the number in @entity28			0
the scheme was put together by @entity79 and @entity80 ( @entity81 )			0
the application pitted mr @entity1 against mr @entity45			1
announcing the scheme , mr @entity21 said : ‘ offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for @entity5 , an opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on our ambitious renewable energy and carbon reduction targets			0
’ mr @entity21 said the sector could generate more than £ 7billion for the economy in @entity5 and support up to 28,000 direct jobs and 20,000 indirectly by 2020			0
the first minister , who is the @entity93 for @entity94 , said : ‘ @entity95 of @entity5 is a world energy capital and , in order to continue to prosper , we have to be at the forefront of all forms of energy research – marine renewables , as well as oil and gas			0
‘ a deployment centre will put @entity28 and @entity15 in pole position for the development of offshore wind technology			1
our ambition must be to see @entity5 as the home of research , development , fabrication and deployment of deep - water marine technology			2
’ the £ 230m proposed wind farm will be in sight of mr @entity1 's golf development on the @entity15 coast @entity24 project spokesman @entity120 said : ‘ the @entity71 ’s most welcome approval for the @entity24 is extremely positive news for both @entity5 and the @entity124 ’s offshore wind industry as it helps position @entity5 , the @entity124 and @entity126 at the global vanguard of the sector			1
’ the scheme ’s go - ahead also relies on @entity15 approving a cable and substation development to bring the power onshore			0
a decision on that was deferred yesterday for a hearing as it emerged that several objections had been lodged .			2
