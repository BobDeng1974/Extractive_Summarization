two of the most powerful forces in the world , money and public opinion , have conspired to bring about the richest and most anticipated fight in boxing history			1
the cash takes the form of the minimum $ 150million ( £ 96m ) which @entity9 is being guaranteed to fight @entity11 in @entity12 on may 2			1
the psychological pressure came to a head when the man who calls himself ‘ money ’ was besieged by fans at an @entity19 game			0
chanting : ‘ we want @entity11 , ’ they clamoured for him to face up to the @entity24 congressman who is his only realistic challenger for the mythical title of greatest pound - for - pound boxer on earth			1
@entity9 has confirmed he will face @entity11 at the @entity28 in @entity12 on may 2 @entity9 posted this image to his @entity31 account on friday shortly after announcing the fight those two elements did more than anything to coax @entity9 out of his five - year hesitation about putting his cherished unbeaten record at its most serious risk yet as he approaches , at coming up 38 this week , the climax to a magnificent career			1
these factors mattered more within the @entity9 psyche than all those protracted , convoluted negotiations			2
@entity11 's acceptance of the smaller share of the booty , the poor chap is only on $ 100m ( £ 64m ) plus bonuses for one night ’s work in the @entity28 , @entity54 and @entity55 agreeing to share the @entity57 pay - per - view broadcast , each boxer wearing his favourite gloves , ' money ' having the honour of entering the ring second , the @entity11 saying yes to @entity59 standard drugs testing … … all these issues and more were mere obstacles waiting to be hurdled by negotiation			1
@entity9 shared the official signed contract for the fight via his @entity66 social media account on friday egos , pecking orders and the settling of old scores had been the immovable barriers for so long that we had come to fear never seeing the two finest boxers of their generation in the same ring			1
incredibly , @entity9 and @entity11 had never even been in the same room until they happened to spy each across the court at a subsequent basketball game			1
hallelujah , that chance meeting helped @entity9 gratify the control freak in his personality			2
it was he who invited @entity11 into conversation and thus he could rightly claim the credit for ending their stand - off			2
@entity90 revealed : click here to read how @entity92 told when the big fight would be announced but lest we forget , @entity11 has always declared himself ready and willing and quickly made the concessions to prove it			1
still , a myriad of detail was still to be settled but all that really remained was for @entity9 to score a point against his old enemy , @entity11 's veteran promoter @entity102 , with whom he had vowed never to work again			1
that he did by demanding the right to make the announcement that the fight is on			0
his delays in so doing gave everyone the jitters but by then his arm had been well and truly twisted			0
@entity11 and @entity9 were pictured together for the first time at the basketball game last month he will come to be grateful that it was because this fight will cement his considerable legacy in the hardest game – win , lose or draw			1
just in time , @entity9 is honouring the tradition of such @entity118 noblemen as @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 – who fought each other without fear of defeat because they knew that only by doing so could they claim their seat in the pantheon			2
you know he senses that importance when he says now : ‘ this is my chance to prove myself t.b.e … … the best ever			0
’ yes , that ego is still in brash working order but more importantly he is doing the right thing by the sport which had made him phenomenally rich and controversially famous			0
@entity139 projected the two fighters onto the big screen and asked the question : ' coming in 2015 ? ' boxing is grateful , also , and never mind that hindsight may reveal that he played a clever game in delaying this inevitable fight until it became this gigantic financial bonanza			2
the worldwide audience of millions will stretch way beyond the core enthusiasts for the hard old game , out across the spectrum of society to engage a new generation			0
the calculating genius of @entity9 has kept him beyond defeat			2
pacquiao the cavalier has exposed himself to the odd loss , while exciting the masses			0
thus there is the prospect of a classic battle of styles – @entity9 ’s scientific technique , refined skills and mastery of the noble art of self defence against the southpaw fury , sustained aggression , knock - out power and non-stop punching of @entity11			1
@entity9 last fought when he beat @entity174 in the pair 's rematch last september in @entity12 if that materialises , these two fighting men can transform boxing into a major sport overnight			1
the instant stampede of enthusiasm suggests that is happening already			0
the @entity184 sold out all its 5,005 rooms within 15 minutes of @entity9 firing the starting gun on line			2
the base room rate for the nights of may 1st and 2nd is upward of $ 500			0
accommodation is already hard find all over the @entity12			0
tickets for ringside seats , expected face value $ 5,000 ( £ 3,300 ) , are already appearing on the black market at up to $ 20,000 ( £ 13,000 )			1
@entity11 was last in action when he dominated @entity196 over 12 rounds in @entity198 last november @entity55 and @entity54 are preparing to charge a record $ 99.95 ( £ 65 ) for a pay - per - view subscription			1
all the @entity184 properties will screen closed circuit transmission on giants screens , entrance fee $ 200 ( £ 130 ) plus			0
millions in the @entity24 will watch on giant screens in city squares and parks			0
a bidding war is under way for tv rights in at least 200 countries outside the @entity57 , the @entity208 included with @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and perhaps @entity216 in contention			0
with the combined purse for @entity9 and @entity11 totalling at least $ 250 million , projections for the value of the event are rising from an initial $ 300 million to close on half a billion			1
if that comes to pass – and there are ten weeks of promotional hype and hysteria to come - the rewards for the combatants will increase			0
this was an offer that @entity231 money - bags could not refuse			0
not that the world would let him .			0
