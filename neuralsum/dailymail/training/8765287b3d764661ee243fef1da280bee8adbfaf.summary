dr @entity0 said researchers should stop spending billions on trying to find a cure for cancer a former editor of the @entity5 has claimed that we should ‘ stop wasting billions trying to cure cancer ’ – because it is the best way to die			1
dr @entity0 says it may be a ‘ romantic view ’ , but cancer gives people a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones , which is denied to many who die from other conditions			1
indeed , he argues that the country is wasting billions trying to cure cancer because curing people of the disease means they are likely to die of worse things , such as dementia			1
but cancer specialists and charities disputed his incendiary comments			2
they said many cancer patients suffered terribly and would not agree that it was ‘ the best way to die ’			1
they also accused the doctor of being ‘ nihilistic ’ about a disease which ‘ takes far too many people far too young ’			2
dr @entity0 , 62 , who was editor of the @entity5 for 13 years until 2004 and is now chairman of the board of directors of medical smartphone app @entity29 , airs his views on the nature of dying in a @entity5 blog			1
leaving aside suicide , he says there are four ways to die : sudden death ; the long , slow death of dementia ; the up and down death of organ failure and death from cancer where you ‘ go down usually in weeks ’			1
he says most people tell him they would prefer a sudden death , but he thinks that is very hard on the families of the deceased			1
‘ the long , slow death from dementia may be the most awful as you are slowly erased , but then again when death comes it may be just a light kiss , ’ he says			2
‘ death from organ failure – respiratory , cardiac , or kidney – will have you far too much in hospital and in the hands of doctors			2
‘ so death from cancer is the best ... you can say goodbye , reflect on your life , leave last messages , perhaps visit special places for a last time , listen to favourite pieces of music , read loved poems , and prepare , according to your beliefs , to meet your maker or enjoy eternal oblivion			2
‘ this is , i recognise , a romantic view of dying , but it is achievable with love , morphine , and whisky			0
but stay away from overambitious oncologists , and let ’s stop wasting billions trying to cure cancer , potentially leaving us to die a much more horrible death			1
’ scroll down for @entity85 dr @entity0 advised patients to ' stay away from overambitious oncologists ' if they are diagnosed with cancer ( file image ) dr @entity0 ’s observations were made in the context of discussing the filmmaker @entity90 ’s fear of overtreatment in his dying days , leading to a ‘ horrible medical death ’			1
he died of pancreatic cancer – at the age of 83			0
but dr @entity0 was strongly criticised for his remarks			1
professor @entity98 , @entity99 ’s chief clinician , said : ‘ of course we are all going to die , but cancer takes far too many people far too young			2
‘ it ’s only by being ambitious in our research that we can give people a measure of choice , and the more we know about cancer the more we can give people options			0
‘ my patients are very clear about when they do and when they do n’t want treatment , and they would much prefer me to be ambitious than nihilistic			0
’ professor @entity113 , a leading oncologist at @entity114 , @entity115 specialising in prostate cancer , said he hoped dr @entity0 would never need his services , adding that doctors ‘ do n’t want anyone to have a horrible death whatever the cause ’			1
he said : ‘ i ca n’t agree we ’re wasting money on cancer research as that would be saying it was n’t worthwhile to make the investment that ’s led to a massive improvement in survival rates			0
deaths from breast cancer have gone down from 17,500 just 25 years ago to 11,700 – this is a fabulous development			0
’ @entity133 , founder and chief executive of the charity @entity135 , was diagnosed with the disease in 2007 and successfully treated			0
she said that in the late stages of pancreatic cancer patients face severe problems such as weight loss and pain			0
‘ there will be many , patients and relatives alike , who will not agree that it is the “ best way to die ” , ’ she said			0
‘ we should be encouraging further investment into cancer research			0
after all , one in three of us will get a cancer of some kind in our lifetime			0
’ dr @entity154 , clinical lead of the @entity155 said : ' i ’m not sure , from a philosophical point of view , why dr @entity0 feels cancer is any different from other diseases , for many of which medical science has discovered effective treatments			1
' if he had been blogging a hundred years ago would he have said tuberculosis was a " preferred " death and berated those " overambitious @entity167 doctors " ? ' childhood leukaemia is an excellent example of where slow , systematic research and clinical trials over many years have resulted in the large majority of children who develop leukaemia now living normal or near - normal lives			0
' @entity178 oncologists certainly played a major role in that and many other success stories			0
' @entity182 , @entity184 @entity183 ’s chief executive added : ' research is not all about trying to find a cure for cancer , much of it is about finding ways to help people live longer and better with the disease			1
' everyone ’s experience is different and to suggest that dying of cancer is the same for everyone is a ridiculous over-simplification			0
' there is no ‘ best ’ disease to die from and what really matters is the quality of life people are helped to enjoy , right up to the end , and that means research into prevention , early diagnosis , better treatment and end - of - life care is a top priority			2
