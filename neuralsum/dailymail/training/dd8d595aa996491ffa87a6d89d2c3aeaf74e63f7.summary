gap - year student @entity11 , 18 , was handing out his cv in the hope of finding a job when he was knifed to death in broad daylight			1
@entity2 , 27 , walked up to the teenager and ‘ without warning ’ stabbed him four times in the chest because he ‘ simply wanted to see what it ’s like to kill someone ’ , a court was told			1
witnesses said engineering student @entity2 appeared to be ‘ laughing ’ and ‘ sniggering ’ as he walked away			1
@entity2 had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility following evidence that it was ‘ highly likely ’ he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia			1
but a jury at @entity32 rejected his defence and found him guilty of murder yesterday after they heard that he wanted the power to choose ‘ who lived and who died ’			1
@entity11 ’s family described the murder as ‘ senseless ’ and said they felt his loss ‘ all the time ’			1
@entity11 lived with his father @entity43 , 54 , mother @entity44 , 45 , sister @entity45 , 17 , and brother @entity46 , 14 , in @entity47 , @entity5			1
mrs @entity44 , a public health programme manager , said : ‘ it is so completely senseless			2
random : gap year student @entity11 - @entity11 was walking to a bus stop in @entity47 when he was attacked ‘ he was just walking along enjoying himself and somebody has attacked him			1
he did not have a chance to do anything			2
' it was just a random , violent assault			2
it has been very difficult as a family			2
it is very , very hard because we feel his loss all the time , and that will continue			2
’ the killing was the second of two street assaults committed by @entity2 on strangers within 12 days in january			1
on january 4 , mature student @entity2 drove from his flat in @entity70 to @entity71 where he punched probation worker @entity72 in the face before running off			1
on january 16 , @entity2 travelled to @entity5 before attacking keen sportsman @entity11 on the streets of @entity75			1
@entity76 , prosecuting , said : ‘ fortified by the apparent ease at which a stranger could be attacked , this time he travelled to @entity5 armed with a knife and intending to kill someone			1
’ victim : this @entity83 footage showed @entity84 taken moments before he was stabbed to death in january heartbreaking : the ' caring and quiet ' teenager was out looking for a job when he was stabbed to death in the street @entity2 drove around @entity75 and @entity47 in the city for an hour in the early afternoon before spotting @entity11 walking along the road listening to music on his headphones			1
he began to circle him , passing him five times in his black @entity95 before parking up and waiting for him			2
@entity11 was carrying his rucksack containing copies of his cv that he intended to hand to shops and businesses			1
the jury was shown shocking @entity83 footage of the attack , with @entity11 , who was planning to read history at @entity105 , being stabbed before collapsing to the ground			1
random : the attack was @entity2 's second street assault on total strangers in 12 days callous : @entity2 was heard to be ' sniggering ' and ' laughing ' as he ran from the scene mr @entity112 added : ‘ the cold stark truth is that			1
( @entity2 ) decided to see if he could get away with killing someone			1
he could exercise power of life and death ; he could choose who lived and who died			2
’ witness @entity121 said : ‘ he took his headphones off and fell forward to the ground			2
he had blood around the mouth and nostrils			2
‘ i started crying – the lad looked so innocent , not streetwise like the man that had run off			2
‘ the other man had a big snigger , a smirk , a laugh			2
’ @entity2 walked calmly to his car before driving back to his rented flat where he ‘ hid the knife and carried on with his studies ’			1
@entity2 will be sentenced today			1
heartbreak : @entity11 was about to get the bus in to @entity140 to look for a job - he was carrying his cv and passport in a backpack investigation : the police complaints watchdog is looking into @entity148 's response to @entity2 's earlier assault - 12 days before he killed @entity11 , pictured with his mother @entity150 @entity151 , @entity152 at @entity153 , said : ' as a result of the verdict reached today , @entity2 has been found guilty of the senseless and brutal murder of @entity84			1
it was an unprovoked attack on a young man who had his whole life ahead of him			2
' throughout the investigation and the court case , @entity2 has refused to accept full responsibility for his actions , instead choosing to hide behind the defence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility			1
' nevertheless , the @entity168 has been determined to bring him to justice and we have worked hard to piece together the evidence and build a strong case against him for the more serious charge of murder			1
' consequently , the jury have rejected his version of events and accepted the prosecution ’s case that @entity2 was in fact fully in control of his actions when he travelled to @entity5 and stabbed @entity11 to death in full view of passing members of the public			1
' at the heart of this truly saddening case in the tragic loss of an innocent man ’s life and i would like to offer my sincere condolences to @entity11 ’s family and friends			1
