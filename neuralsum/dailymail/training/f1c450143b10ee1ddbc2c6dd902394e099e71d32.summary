the app - available on the @entity2 @entity1 and on @entity3 - lets you tell the world where and when you ' made love ' - and even rate the experience out of five and offer comments sharing apps such as @entity10 already let us share where we eat , drink and shop			1
now ' @entity15 ' lets you log and gps - tag your private life in just the same way - and , bizarrely , some people seem to want to			0
the @entity3 app has been downloaded 10,000 times , and rated five stars by dozens of users			1
' did you just make love ? or just want to check where people near you made love ? ' says the app. ' i just made love lets you do all that and more ! ' the @entity3 - and now @entity33 - app lets you record where , when and even in what position you ' made love ' - and then upload it to an online database - with your comments			1
the @entity3 app has already been downloaded 10,000 times			1
the @entity33 app is available to download via i just made @entity40 's site - and seems to be available via the @entity2 @entity1 , although not the @entity41 one			2
the app is free , earning its money via advertising			2
the i just made @entity40 site claims to have recorded 193,000 ' acts of love ' , along with where the event occurred and a limited amount of context - very limited , in fact , offering only the options of @entity54 , outdoors , in a car and on a boat			0
most of the posts via the site so far seem to be in @entity60 - with only isolated instances of lovemaking in other countries			0
one brave soul ( male , on a sofa ) even logged an act of love from @entity69 - although he declined to comment			0
highly unlikely : the overwhelming majority of posts seem to be from men , many seem simply to be jokes , and the majority seem to be from @entity60 tech site @entity76 pointed out that as the app is anonymous , posting lovemaking statistics on a version of @entity82 , its impossible to verify , or even challenge anything posted via the app. ' i just made love lets one brag without the fear that someone who knows better will pointing out that one apparently managed it without company , ' the site wrote			2
' what is clear , and at risk of quoting @entity94 , is that love has nothing whatsoever to do with it			0
