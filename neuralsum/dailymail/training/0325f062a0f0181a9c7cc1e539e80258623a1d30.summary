clearly emotional , @entity15 wiped tears from his eyes while paying his respects at the @entity22 in @entity23 yesterday			0
the lead delegates were the widow of former @entity8 president @entity27 , who engineered a ' sunshine ' engagement policy with the @entity1 and held a landmark summit with @entity15 in 2000 , and @entity53 chairwoman @entity52 , whose late husband had ties to the @entity1			2
@entity1 sent delegations to @entity57 when the women 's husbands died			0
they stood in a line on a red carpet and bowed silently during their visit to the @entity22 palace , where @entity15 's bier is surrounded by flowers and flanked by an honor guard , footage from @entity70 @entity69 in @entity36 showed			1
@entity11 and the two women later exchanged handshakes and clasped their hands when they had brief conversations			0
rise to power : @entity11 has become head of the @entity79 of the @entity80 - a position that appears to make him the top official in the ruling party respect : @entity11 bows his head in honour of his father through the meeting , @entity15 appeared to be sending a message pushing @entity8 to pursue previously agreed upon cooperative projects that would give his country much - needed hard currency , said @entity94 , a professor at @entity57 - based @entity95			1
monday 's meeting appeared to be @entity15 's first meeting with @entity8 since his father 's death			1
it was also the fourth time the @entity1 's media reported that @entity15 had visited the memorial palace since his father 's death , according to @entity57 's @entity104			1
it seems clear now that @entity11 , who is in his late 20s , is now in position to extend the @entity15 family 's control over the country of 24million people to a third generation			1
late monday , @entity36 called @entity15 a ' sagacious leader ' and ' dear ' comrade as he again paid respects to his father , whose body is lying in state at @entity22			2

' as dear comrade @entity11 , who is a sagacious leader of our party , state and military , is at the forefront of our revolutionary cause , the history of our father and general 's glorious military - first revolution will continue , ' it said			2
his grandfather @entity144 , a revered figure , founded @entity1 in 1948 and was succeeded by @entity15 , who ruled for 17 years			0
just as @entity1 created a cult of personality around the previous two @entity148 , the youngest @entity15 has also been showered with intense praise and new titles in the state media			0
the main @entity153 newspaper described him monday as head of the @entity79 of the @entity80 - a post that appears to make him the top official in the ruling party			0
earlier , the @entity1 referred to him as ' supreme leader ' of the 1.2 million - strong armed forces and said the military 's top leaders had pledged their loyalty to him			0
on tuesday , the two lead @entity8 delegates met @entity164 , president of @entity165 of @entity1 's parliament , who often represents the country and is considered a nominal head of state , according to the @entity170 footage			2

dynasty : pictures of @entity11 's grandfather @entity144 and father @entity15 at the unification observation post near the border village of the @entity177			2
@entity11 is now in position to extend the family 's control over the country @entity11 's new titles are slight variations of those held by his father , but appear to carry the same weight			0
it was unclear whether the nation 's constitution had been changed to reflect the transfer of leadership as when @entity15 took power after his father 's death			1
@entity195 continued , meanwhile , despite frigid winter weather , in the final days before @entity15 's funeral , which is set to take place wednesday , and a memorial thursday			1
people continued lining up in central @entity36 's @entity201 , where a massive portrait that usually features @entity144 has been replaced by one of @entity15 , to bow before his smiling image and to lay funeral flowers			2
heated buses stood by to give mourners a respite from the cold , and hot tea and water were distributed from beverage kiosks			0
the funeral of @entity15 will be watched closely for clues to who will gain power and who will fall out of favour under the next leader , his son @entity11			1
however the state ceremonies over wednesday and thursday are also likely to bear the hallmarks of @entity15 's rule , including more of a military presence for the man who elevated the armed forces as part of his " songun , " or " military first , " policy			1
@entity15 , who has been lying in state since he died on december 17 , celebrated major occasions with lavish , meticulously choreographed parades designed to show off the nation 's military might , such as the october 2010 display when he introduced his son and anointed successor to the world			0
" a display of weapons may also be a way to demonstrate that the military remains loyal to the succession process , " said @entity239 of the @entity240 in @entity8			0
" there may even be a small - scale military parade involving aeroplanes			0
" like his father was when former leader @entity144 died in 1994 , @entity11 has been stoic in a dark blue @entity251 - style suit in mourning period appearances - but so far without the black armband that @entity15 wore at the funeral to mark him as head mourner .			1

thanks former @entity8 first lady and prominent business leader for their condolences over @entity15 's death
during meeting , @entity11 appeared to be urging further *co-operation* with @entity8
