by 2030 up to 170 million hectares of forest - equivalent to the combined size of @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 - could be lost , conservationists have warned			1
the huge amount of global deforestation is expected to occur in less than a dozen global hostpots , based on current trends			2
research by wildlife charity the @entity11 identified 11 ' deforestation fronts ' where 80 per cent of projected global forest losses by 2030 could occur			1
by 2030 up to 170 million hectares ( 420 million acres ) of forest - equivalent to the combined size of @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 - could be lost in just 11 hotspots , including the @entity18 ( shown ) and eastern @entity19 , conservationists have warned the areas are the @entity18 , the @entity21 and @entity22 , and the @entity23 in @entity24 , the @entity25 in @entity26 , the @entity27 , @entity28 , eastern @entity19 , the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
the fronts , which are at sustained and increased risk of deforestation , are home to indigenous communities that depend them for their livelihoods and endangered species such as orangutans and tigers , the @entity11 said			1
the @entity18 the @entity21 and @entity22 the @entity23 the @entity25 - @entity45 the @entity27 @entity28 @entity19 the @entity29 @entity31 @entity32 @entity33 but they are being lost to expanding agriculture , including livestock farming , palm oil plantations and soy production , as well as small - scale farmers , the @entity11 's latest @entity46 warned			1
unsustainable logging and wood fuel collection is also causing forest degradation - while mining , construction of hydroelectric dams and other projects cause roads to be built that open new areas of forest to settlers and agriculture , the @entity11 warned			2
the conservation group is calling for action including expanding and strengthening protected areas , recognising the benefits forests provide and boosting schemes which provide incentives to countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation			0
@entity11 - @entity73 is campaigning to close @entity75 loopholes which mean that products such as furniture , books or cards can be sold which have been made from illegally or unsustainably sourced wood			2
the fronts , which are at sustained and increased risk of deforestation , are home to indigenous communities that depend them for their livelihoods and endangered species such as orangutans and tigers , the @entity11 said			1
80 per cent of projected losses will occur in just these 11 areas @entity94 , director of the @entity11 's global forest programme , said : ' imagine a forest stretching across @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 wiped out in just 20 years			1
' we must tackle that risk to save the communities and cultures that depend on forests , and ensure forests continue to store carbon , filter our water , supply wood and provide habitat for millions of species			0
' @entity11 analysis shows that more than 230 million hectares ( 570 million acres ) of forest could vanish by 2050 if no action is taken , with the organisation warning that forest loss must be reduced to near zero by 2020 to avoid dangerous climate change and economic losses			1
they are being lost to expanding agriculture ( example of a rainforest cleared in the @entity18 shown ) , including livestock farming , palm oil plantations and soy production , as well as small - scale farmers , the @entity11 's latest living forests report warned unsustainable logging and wood fuel collection ( shown in @entity19 ) is also causing forest degradation - while mining , construction of hydroelectric dams and other projects cause roads to be built that open new areas of forest to settlers and agriculture , said the @entity11 @entity11 - @entity73 's chief adviser of forests , @entity135 , said : ' deforestation needs to stop if we are to reverse biodiversity loss and combat climate change - which , if unchecked , will affect our quality of life			1
' managing forests sustainably could underpin sustainable development , poverty alleviation and a stable climate around the world			0
' he added : ' here in the @entity73 you can still buy furniture , books , cards and other products made from illegally or unsustainably sourced wood			0
@entity75 rules to prevent the exploitation of forests only cover half of traded products			0
' the next @entity73 government should lobby hard to end this nonsense			0
' thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the @entity18 each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world			2
but despite this , the planet has got greener in the past decade , with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall , according to one study			0
the increase is so noticeable that the world 's trees and plants now store almost four billion more tonnes of carbon than they did in 2003			0
this is thanks to tree - planting in @entity189 , forest regrowth in former @entity185 states because of abandoned farms , and more lush savannas because of higher rainfall			0
scientists analysed 20 years of satellite data and found an increase in carbon , despite ongoing large - scale tropical deforestation in @entity196 and @entity197 , according to research published in @entity199 .			0

up to 420 million acres of forest will be lost in the next two decades
warning comes from the @entity11 ( @entity11 )
80 per cent of project losses will occur in just 11 ' deforestation fronts '
the include the @entity18 , eastern @entity19 and @entity33
