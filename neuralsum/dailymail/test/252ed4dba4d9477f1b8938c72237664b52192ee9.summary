despite being fierce rivals , @entity0 and @entity1 have a somewhat symbiotic relationship when it comes to manufacturing their handsets			1
now it has been reported that the @entity8 tech giant will be the main supplier of the @entity10 chips in @entity0 's upcoming @entity12 range			1
although this is n't the first time @entity1 has manufactured parts for @entity17 , it signals that the frosty partnership between the two may be thawing			1
@entity1 will reportedly be the main supplier of the @entity10 chips in @entity0 's upcoming @entity12 range			1
@entity1 has previously supplied @entity0 with various @entity12 parts , but following legal disputes , @entity0 shifted away from its rival and signed a monopoly deal with @entity24 ( @entity24 ) in 2013 @entity0 relies heavily on other firms to produce the various components it uses in its iphones and @entity29			1
and for years , @entity1 was a dominant member of this group			2
it produced the flash and working memory in the @entity12 , for example , and was a substantial @entity0 chip partner until 2013			1
however , following legal disputes , @entity0 shifted away from @entity1 and signed a deal with @entity24 ( @entity24 ) to produce the @entity38 seen in the @entity39			1
@entity1 has announced better - than - expected profits for the first quarter of 2015			2
a rising demand for memory chips is said to be helping offset a slump in the firm 's smartphone sales			2
during a call on tuesday , the electronics giant estimated an operating profit of 5.9 trillion won ( $ 5.4 billion / Â£ 3.6 million ) between january and march			0
this beat analyst expectations and was up 11.5 per cent from the previous quarter			0
but this forecast was down 30.5 per cent from a year ago			0
it did n't cut @entity1 off completely , though , and around 40 per cent of chips in the @entity55 are still made by the @entity8 giant or partners			1
but by handing the monopoly to @entity24 , it directly affected @entity1 's business			2
reports of the @entity10 deal first appeared last year when a ' source familiar with the deal ' told @entity64 : ' @entity0 has designated @entity1 as the primary supplier of its next chips powering @entity68 devices from 2016			1
' the deal is said to be worth ' billions of dollars			0
' from next year , this report continued @entity1 will supply 80 per cent of @entity0 's supply of application processors , with @entity24 supplying the remaining 20 per cent			1
@entity1 then confirmed it was planning to mass produce its latest chips later this year			2
the @entity8 firm recently partnered with @entity77 - based semiconductor experts @entity75			0
it was said to be this deal that appealed to @entity0 because it will help @entity1 meet the demand for @entity0 's chips globally , and lets @entity75 use @entity1 's latest technology patents			1
as part of this deal , @entity82 said @entity1 will start making the @entity10 at its @entity85 plant in @entity86 , with additional orders going to @entity75			1
reports of the @entity10 deal first appeared last year when a ' source familiar with the deal ' told @entity64 that @entity0 had designated @entity1 as the primary supplier of its next @entity68 chip in 2016			1
@entity1 will supply 80 % of @entity0 's supply of application processors , with @entity24 supplying the remaining 20 % earlier today , @entity1 announced better - than - expected profits for the first quarter of 2015 thanks to a rising demand for memory chips			1
but profits are predicted to be 30.5 % down compared to this time last year			0
this follows news @entity1 is facing a ' bendgate ' controversy after a video showed its @entity106 bending and shattering earlier today @entity1 announced better - than - expected profits for the first quarter of 2015			2
a rising demand for memory chips is said to be helping offset a slump in the firm 's smartphone sales , but profits are predicted to be 30.5 per cent down compared to this time last year			2
this follows news @entity1 is facing a ' bendgate ' controversy , after famously mocking @entity0 when it emerged its @entity116 could bend out of shape in people 's pockets			1
a video from warranty firm @entity121 shows the @entity122 bending under similar pressure as the @entity55			0
but , more importantly , the screen on the @entity125 shattered during this test , while @entity0 's did n't			1
this led to @entity1 releasing its own video , demonstrating a three - point bend test on both its @entity131 models			0
' we are confident that all our smartphones are not bendable under daily usage , ' the company said in a statement			0
@entity121 found that the @entity122 bends and shatters under 110lbs ( 50kg ) of pressure			0
it also tested the @entity139 m9 both deformed and broke at 120lbs ( 54kg )			0
@entity1 added that the test done by @entity121 ' does not show the strength of the back side ' and it has now asked @entity121 to do the test again on both the front and back sides of the device			0
@entity0 had to go to similar lengths during its own ' @entity149 ' crisis , by allowing reporters into its labs to showcase @entity12 6 plus durability tests			0
the teardown shows , from the front , the screen , logic board holder , battery , logic board with processor , camera , rear case and antenna			0
it is a fascinating view of exactly what goes into a modern smartphone - and how @entity1 does business			0
the @entity167 site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm 's @entity131 , which goes on sale on april 10th			0
the internals reveal @entity1 used more of its own chips to power the new @entity131 smartphone than it did for the predecessor @entity176 , according to an early teardown report , in a blow to @entity180 chip supplier @entity179			1
@entity1 is not only using its own @entity185 mobile processor , as had been widely reported , but also decided to rely on its in - house semiconductor business to source other parts , including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips , @entity183 - based consultancy @entity181 said			2
@entity1 is counting on its new flagship @entity131 and @entity106 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014			0
strong sales of system chips such as its @entity185 processor could also help boost earnings , analysts and investors say			0
the @entity131 also comes with @entity1 's @entity202 modem chip , @entity180 phone @entity199 said on its website .			2

reports claim @entity1 will make the @entity10 chips for @entity0 's next iphone
@entity38 and @entity209 were mostly made by @entity210
@entity0 moved away from @entity1 as a substantial chip partner in 2013
@entity1 has previously made flash and working memory for @entity17
