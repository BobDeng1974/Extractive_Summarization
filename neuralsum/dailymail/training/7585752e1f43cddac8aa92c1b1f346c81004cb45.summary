by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 29 april 2013 scandal : @entity3 chief @entity2 revealed details of the sex abuse investigation , which involved at least 140 victims over 30 years one of @entity9 ’s biggest child abuse scandals is likely to have been even larger than previously thought , police revealed yesterday			1
dozens of former residents of @entity3 children ’s homes have given detectives ‘ graphic ’ accounts of appalling abuse at the hands of 84 staff – most of whom have never been prosecuted			1
barely a decade after a £ 13million public inquiry that was meant to uncover the extent of the scandal , police yesterday revealed they had ‘ significant ’ new evidence of ‘ serious and systemic ’ abuse			1
home secretary @entity26 ordered the new inquiry after allegations on the @entity31 ’s @entity30 programme last november that a public inquiry which looked at the scandal had failed to uncover the full extent of the abuse			1
the now - notorious @entity30 film led to @entity38 grandee @entity37 being wrongly implicated in the abuse			0
in their first major progress report yesterday , officers who have been sifting through the accounts of former residents of the homes revealed the appalling scale of the suspected abuse			1
and they warned that abusers who believed they had evaded justice should for ever be ‘ looking over their shoulders ’ in fear of arrest and prosecution			0
the @entity54 of 2000 heard from 650 witnesses and led to the conviction of seven former care workers			2
the report , by former high court judge sir @entity58 , said sexual and physical abuse mainly focused on six council - run homes and two private homes between 1994 and 1990			1
many ex-residents of homes including the notorious @entity54 , near @entity71 , have long argued that @entity58 ’s terms of reference – focusing on abuse within the properties – meant claims of links to a wider paedophile ring in the area were ignored			1
but the bombshell claim by @entity54 to have been abused by @entity37 was discredited when he was belatedly shown a photograph of the former @entity38 treasurer and conceded he had named the wrong man			2
the furore last november led to the resignation of @entity31 director general @entity102 after just 54 days in charge			0
officers working on @entity65 have made one arrest so far			0
a man was held in @entity107 last week and then bailed			0
among those who have given their accounts of being abused to the new inquiry is @entity112 , who was a @entity54 resident from 1972 - 74 and is now a local councillor			2
none of his alleged abusers were prosecuted , but he has given detectives the names of four he is prepared to testify against and predicted more ex-residents would now come forward			0
mr @entity112 , 55 , said : ‘ i was worried it was going to be another whitewash after going through the @entity54 , so i ’m very relieved			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
