in the joint statement , they said : ' we , the families of missing schoolgirls , pray for the immediate safe return of our beloved daughters			1
we feel our loss more acutely on mothers - day as we look over to their beds and see only the spaces left behind by them			0
' we will continue to do everything we possibly can to ensure our girls are brought back to us safely			1
' the families also used the statement to again lash out at authorities , suggesting the school , @entity44 and the local authority ' failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information '			1
they said : ' as parents , we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care			0
' had we been made aware of circumstances sooner , we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the @entity18			1
' the schoolgirls are understood to now be in the terror group 's @entity63 after fleeing the @entity18 last month			1
the girls were pictured going through security at @entity25 last month , dressed in @entity68 clothes			2
@entity75 ( left ) , cousin of @entity10 , @entity71 ( centre ) , sister of @entity8 , and @entity74 ( right ) , father of @entity9 , gave evidence to the @entity77 in the @entity78 last week sir @entity79 , @entity80 ( pictured at the @entity77 ) said that , with the benefit of hindsight , officers should have communicated directly with the families they were later seen on @entity85 in @entity26 , dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with @entity2			1
they are believed to be staying with @entity91 , the fellow pupil from their school who went missing in december			2
@entity91 , the first of the schoolgirls to go to @entity96 , is thought to be in the @entity98 stronghold of @entity99 the 15 - year - old student , the first of the four to disappear from @entity16 in east @entity17 , had not been identified by the authorities but was named this week			2
metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity79 has admitted that ' with the benefit of hindsight ' officers should have communicated directly with the families			2
but he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology			0
however , the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers ' actions when they appeared before a committee of mps earlier this month			2
instead , they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children 's potential radicalisation			2
they were led by their lawyer @entity125 , once the representative of a close associate of the @entity130 killers , who repeatedly demanded an apology			0
the country 's top police officer was later forced to apologise to the families over a misplaced letter relating to @entity91 's disappearance , apologising that it ' did n't get through '			2
the letter had been given to the three pupils instead of being sent directly to the parents , after the girl were spoken to by police as potential witnesses after she went missing			0
however , senior figures , led by @entity144 , have previously insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs			0
' everyone has a role to play , ' said the prime minister			0
foreign secretary @entity153 echoed the comments saying : ' parents have responsibilities , schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators			0
' ' we , the families of missing schoolgirls , pray for the immediate safe return of our beloved daughters			1
we feel our loss more acutely on mothers - day as we look over to their beds and see only the spaces left behind by them			0
' as you can imagine , the last few weeks have been incredibly difficult			0
we would like to thank the public for their generosity of spirit and support in this most trying of times			0
' with respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school , @entity44 police and the local authority , all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other			1
' as parents , we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care			0
had we been made aware of circumstances sooner , we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the @entity18			1
' we note and appreciate @entity201 's very recent attempt to educate parents with respect to such dangers with a pamphlet on radicalisation and extremism			0
likewise , we appreciate the police 's apology with respect to their mishandling			0
we hope other families wo n't have to bear the same pain that we are enduring at the moment , and that lessons are learned from our experience			0
' looking to the future , we hope to work with the relevant authorities to rectify the situation , and we will continue to do everything we possibly can to ensure our girls are brought back to us safely			1
