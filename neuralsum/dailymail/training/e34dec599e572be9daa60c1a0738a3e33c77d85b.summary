@entity6 , 39 , lost her eye after her two - year - old horse @entity9 threw his hoof into the side of her face - smashing her eye socket and cheek bone into six pieces , and causing a brain haemorrhage			1
surgeons told her that her horrendous injuries were similar to those suffered by a bomb blast victim - and had no choice but to remove what remained of her right eye			1
despite her terrible ordeal , mrs @entity6 , from @entity24 , north @entity25 , was determined not to give up on her horses			1
@entity6 ( with horses @entity29 and @entity30 ) is lucky to be alive after her skull was crushed twice by her horses first , she lost her eye after her two - year - old horse @entity9 threw his hoof into the side of her face - smashing her eye socket and cheek bone into six pieces , and causing a brain haemorrhage but just two years after her accident , she was kicked in the head again - shattering her other eye socket , and breaking the top part of her arm in half			1
ten months on from her second brush with death , doctors have still been unable to fix her broken arm - but she is still determined to follow her dream of becoming a para dressage champion			1
mrs @entity6 , who works in transport hire , said : ' to be kicked in the head by a horse once is incredibly unlucky - but twice is unbelievable			1
' i 've lost my eye and had to adjust to a whole new way of life , learning to do the most mundane tasks with limited vision			1
' it 's really hard to deal with becoming monocular later in life , as i have had to re-educate my brain			1
' i could n't believe it when i was kicked for a second time - my skull had only just really repaired itself from the first accident			1
' my arm is so badly broken that surgeons are struggling to find a way to mend it			1
it 's been broken in two places since may last year , and it just will not heal naturally			0
' mrs @entity6 has also suffered chronic osteomyilitus ( an infection of the bones ) and is currently receiving treatment for a suspected deep vein thrombosis			1
she has also lost feeling in my ring and little finger and very little movement in her fingers			1
she said : ' i do n't blame my horses for what happened - they were n't trying to hurt me , and my injuries are something i just have to accept			1
' it has made me determined to follow my dreams and to compete in and promote para sports and encourage others to give riding a try , for someone who can not move i ca n't imagine the freedom and feeling of movement this would give			2
' two years later she was kicked in the head again , shattering her other eye socket , and breaking the top part of her arm in half ten months on from her second brush with death , doctors have still been unable to fix her broken arm her first accident happened as she mucked out her two - year - old gelding in december 2009			1
she said : ' i had given @entity9 a toy to play with in his stable			0
he was very excited by it , and was bucking waiting to get out			0
' i went into the stable to get him and suddenly - bam ! - his foot connected with my head			1
' my body seemed to go onto autopilot			0
i did n't realise how badly hurt i was and i carried on working , before realising that i needed to call an ambulance			0
' i do n't remember much else apart from my mum and my husband shouting at me to stay awake			0
' if they had n't kept me conscious , i doubt i 'd be here today			0
" when i finally came round , i was told that my eye was squashed like a grape on the floor			2
doctors thought that my other eye might lose vision if my bad eye was n't removed , so i agreed to have it taken out			2
' i felt like a lamb to the slaughter when i walked into that operating theatre			0
' the thought of losing my eye was terrifying			2
but i refused to allow myself to sit and dwell on what i 'd lost			2
i had to just get on with it			0
she has also suffered a chronic bone infection and has very little movement in her fingers determined : despite her ordeal , @entity6 is still determined to follow her dream of becoming a para dressage champion ' i was desperate to get back and look after my horses , but i had to stay away for a month because of the risk of infection			1
' i had to teach myself how to live again			0
even the simplest tasks were a nightmare with only one eye , as i 'd lost my sense of depth			1
it was so difficult to drive my car , or peg the washing out on the line - i 'd constantly be reaching for things and they 'd be nowhere near where i perceived them to be			2
' eight weeks after the accident , i was determined to get back on my horses , and although i was terrified , i managed to do it			0
' sadly , i had to sell @entity9 , as i could n't risk being injured again as i broke him in to be ridden , but i keep in touch with his new owner			0
' but as mrs @entity6 started to get back on track , disaster struck again - after she was caught in the cross fire after her two other horses , @entity29 and @entity30 , struck out in a field			1
she was again rushed to the @entity163 in @entity164 , where doctors battled to save her			0
she said : ' i 'd gone to feed the horses out in their field , and luckily , my husband @entity168 came with me			0
' i gave them separate feed bowls , but they started scrapping , and before i knew what had happened , i was struck again			0
' i think that if i 'd had 100 per cent vision , i might have seen what was happening quickly enough to get out of the way , but it happened before i even realised it			0
' again , i suffered serious facial injuries and my left humerus was snapped in half			2
' i had pins and plates inserted into my arm in a bid to fuse the bones back together , but 10 months on , after chronic osteomyilitus it 's still broken and supported with a plastic brace resembling a floppy sausage			2
she is hoping that an operation next month will finally sort the problem			0
mrs @entity6 added : ' hopefully i 'll be able to get back on a horse soon , and start some para dressage to music			1
' my dream is to be good enough to compete at @entity196 , although i may have to win the lottery , as to ride at this level you need a talented horse and loads of training			2
' funding and sponsorship are limited when you become disabled later in life and seems to apply to the under 25 's , but maybe i 'll get lucky given everything that 's happened			0
' i do n't know where i get my motivation and drive but simply ca n't imagine life without a horse and am not prepared to settle for this option			2
' i ca n't thank my family and friends enough for all the help and support they have given me - and the @entity217 , which has given me support and advice			0
' i want to give people that have had a disabling injury hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel			0
