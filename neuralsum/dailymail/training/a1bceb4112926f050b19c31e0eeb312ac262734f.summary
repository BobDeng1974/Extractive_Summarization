by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has unveiled plans for a hypersonic spy plane that could fly at @entity5 , twice as fast as its famed @entity6 , and said a missile demonstrating the new technology could fly as early as 2018			1
@entity9 , the @entity2 engineer who has headed the seven - year research effort , said the new aircraft , dubbed the @entity12 , was designed using off - the - shelf materials to keep it affordable in the current tough budget environment			1
he said the new plane offered game - changing capabilities to the military - and a twin - engine demonstrator jet that could reach any target in an hour could be developed for under $ 1 billion in five to six years			0
the jet accelerates by way of a two - part system			0
a conventional jet turbine helps boost the aircraft up to @entity27 , at which point a specialized ramjet takes over and pushes the plane even faster into hypersonic mode			1
the @entity12 will use a new hypersonic engine and will be twice as fast with a cruising speed of @entity5 in a hurry ? the @entity12 will fly at @entity5 ( around 4,000 mph ) ' hypersonic is the new stealth , ' @entity9 said			1
' your adversaries can not hide or move their critical assets			0
that becomes a game - changer			0
' the new aircraft would travel three times as fast as current fighter jets , which can reach speeds of @entity49 , twice the speed of sound , and it could be outfitted with light weapons to strike targets			2
replacement : the @entity12 supersedes @entity6			1
for more than 25 years , the aircraft provided the nation with demonstrated strategic reconnaissance capability @entity6 : when the last @entity6 was grounded in 1998 it was a double blow			1
not only did aviation lose one of the most advanced aircraft ever built , but also one of the most beautiful when the last @entity6 was grounded in 1998 it was a double blow			2
not only did aviation lose one of the most advanced aircraft ever built			0
the @entity6 is one of history ’s great aircraft			2
it was built during the @entity68 in the early 1960s by @entity2 at its secret @entity70 facility and flew from 1966 to 1998			0
with black paint covering its unprecedented titanium fuselage , it was designed as a reconnaissance platform capable of flying 2,900 nautical miles ( 5,400 km ) at sustained supersonic speeds at an altitude of 80,000 ft ( 24,000 m )			2
the @entity6 could fly so fast and so high that it could literally outrun enemy missiles , and routinely did			1
. using a new hypersonic engine design that combines turbines and ramjets , the company says that the unmanned @entity12 will be twice as fast as its predecessor with a cruising speed of @entity5			1
hypersonic : the @entity85 s purpose is to provide the @entity86 with not only a hypersonic recon platform , but also a strike aircraft as well how it works : the upper engine is a turbine , which is used to power the @entity12 as it takes off from a conventional runway and accelerates it to @entity27			2
then the lower dual - mode ramjet takes over and accelerates the plane to @entity5 the @entity85 ’s purpose is to provide the @entity86 with not only a hypersonic recon platform , but also a strike aircraft as well			1
' hypersonic aircraft , coupled with hypersonic missiles , could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour , ' says @entity9 , @entity2 program manager , @entity104			0
' speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades			0
the technology would be a game - changer in theater , similar to how stealth is changing the battle space today			0
' in an interview with @entity114 , which broke the story , @entity9 explained that the retirement of the @entity6 left significant gaps in the satellites , subsonic manned and unmanned platforms meant to replace it , which the @entity12 will fill			1
the article went on to point out that the sr - 72 program is meant to dovetail with the @entity126 ’s hypersonic research and weapons programs , which has dictated the timetable and many design parameters			0
bye bye blackbird : by bye blackbird : the @entity12 is the replacement for the @entity6 blackbird ( pictured )			1
the @entity6 was built during the @entity68 in the early 1960s by @entity2 at its secret @entity70 facility and flew from 1966 to 1998 according to @entity9 , a @entity5 platform would not only leave very little time for an enemy to respond , but it also be a very effective way to launch hypersonic missiles			1
since these would n't need a booster rocket when launched at six times the speed of sound , they can be of much lighter and simpler construction			0
no new technologies needed to be invented for the @entity12 so a demonstration aircraft could fly by 2018 , and the plane could be operational by 2030			1
details of the new hypersonic spy plane project emerged days after @entity2 , the @entity126 's biggest supplier , teamed up with no. 2 supplier @entity146 ( @entity150 ) to develop a bid for the @entity126 's new long - range @entity152 , @entity146 and other big weapons makers are pressing the @entity126 to continue funding new aircraft development programs despite big cuts in military spending , arguing that a retreat from such projects could undercut @entity86 military superiority in years to come			2
greatly missed : the retirement of the @entity6 ( pictured ) left significant gaps in the satellites , subsonic manned and unmanned platforms meant to replace it , which the @entity85 will fill @entity9 , who works for @entity2 's @entity70 advanced development arm , said missiles based on the new technology could be ready for operational use in 2020 , at a cost only slightly more than the current @entity169 or @entity170 declined to say how much it had invested in the sr - 72 project to date , or what the new airplane might cost if it is ever built			1
but it said it had tried to keep the current tight budget environment in mind while working on the project			0
' what we are doing is defining a missile that would have a small incremental cost to go at hypersonic speed , ' @entity9 said			0
he said about 20 @entity2 employees had worked on the project.one key factor in keeping the new project affordable was a decision to limit speed to @entity5 , rather than reaching for higher speeds that would require more expensive materials such as those used on the space shuttle , @entity9 said			0
he said top @entity126 officials had been briefed on the program 's progress and they were very interested in the new technology as a possible way to counter work by potential adversaries on technologies that could detect stealth @entity200 said the company and its partners had developed and tested key components of the proposed new aircraft using their own internal research funding , but the program needed additional funds to move ahead with larger - scale demonstrations of the technologies @entity210 , analyst with @entity211 , said in a note on friday that the new aircraft could help the @entity86 military quickly identify or hit targets that were intentionally hidden or protected by an enemy 's air defenses			2
he said the previous @entity6 was " the coolest airplane ever made , rivaled only by fictional aircraft			2
" @entity9 said @entity2 had worked closely with @entity219 , a unit of @entity221 ( @entity222 ) , to develop a propulsion system for the new aircraft , which uses an off - the - shelf turbine with a scramjet engine to reach the hypersonic @entity227 project builds on @entity228 , an earlier hypersonic project funded by the @entity126 's @entity230 ( @entity231 ) that was canceled in 2008 after its turbojet engines were found not ready for further development .			0

the @entity6 flew faster than any other *production* plane
its successor , the @entity12 , will go twice as fast
a demo version of the @entity12 could be ready by 2018
the new aircraft will blaze across the *sky* at around @entity5
plane would perform high - altitude *intelligence* , *surveillance* , and reconnaissance missions but also be capable of carrying out strikes on targets
