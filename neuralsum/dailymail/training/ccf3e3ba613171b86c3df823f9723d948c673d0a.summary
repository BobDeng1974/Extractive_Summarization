@entity0 claims to be 847 times more effective than other antioxidants at replenishing skin so called ‘ miracle ’ anti-ageing products and creams are ten a penny these days and promise various extreme results using a variety of weird and wonderful ingredients			1
however , the science behind such products is often extremely dubious , with some claims boarding on ludicrous			0
