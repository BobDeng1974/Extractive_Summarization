@entity1 manager claims he has limited pool of homegrown players to select from @entity6 questions ' englishness ' of @entity7 three @entity9 boss says there are no @entity12 players at some games he attends by @entity14 published : 05:04 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 16:49 est , 17 april 2013 @entity6 fears for the future of the @entity1 team because of the number of foreign players in the @entity7			1
@entity6 claims he is selecting his squad from a decreasing pool of talent because of the number of overseas stars in the top flight , and worries the national team will be dragged into a @entity27 play - off after last month ’s poor performance against @entity29 in @entity30 @entity6 , who succeeded @entity32 @entity31 as the country ’s coach last may , said : ‘ i go to quite a few games these days and there are no @entity12 players			1
one has to be very careful talking about the @entity7 and the @entity4 of it because two thirds of the players are not @entity12			1
we have one of the lowest numbers of homegrown players and that must put us at a major disadvantage to other nations			2
’ limited : @entity1 boss @entity6 has bemoaned the lack of homegrown players in the @entity7 @entity50 's @entity52 column here @entity6 was at @entity53 to watch six @entity12 players start for @entity55 and three for @entity56 last week			1
but he is still at a disadvantage compared to the other major leagues in @entity59			0
just 34.9 per cent of the players in the @entity7 are eligible for the national team , compared with 45 per cent in @entity63 ’s @entity62 and @entity65 ’s @entity64 , 58 per cent in @entity67 ’s @entity66 and 59 per cent in @entity69 ’s @entity68			0
the demand for foreign talent even gripped @entity6 during his spell in charge at @entity74 before he replaced @entity31 at the end of last season			0
leading the way : @entity6 claims two - thirds of @entity7 players - like @entity56 duo @entity80 and @entity81 - are not @entity12 in his final game as manager at the @entity84 , a 3 - 2 home defeat against @entity86 , he picked only two @entity12 players			1
@entity88 and @entity89 are both eligible to play for the national team , but neither are considered good enough to break into the current squad			0
despite @entity6 ’s concerns , there are moves in place to safeguard and protect the national team			0
more than £ 340million is being invested by the @entity7 over the next five years in development projects across all levels of the game			0
the @entity101 has also been designed to produce more homegrown players because of the genuine fears about the quality of @entity12 talent			1
talking point : @entity6 's comments mirror the sentiments expressed recently by his assistant @entity109 @entity55 we stand : @entity111 and @entity112 are two regulars in @entity6 's @entity1 squads the influence of foreign players has also affected the make - up of the @entity119 ’s annual @entity118			1
when the award started in 1974 , nine of the players voted for by fellow professionals in the old @entity123 were @entity12			0
that trend continued until @entity126 playmaker @entity125 became the first overseas player to be named in the @entity118 in 1979			0
the @entity7 era has had a massive influence on the nominations and now it is rare for more than four @entity12 players to be named			1
last year there were four , but in 2011 @entity134 and @entity135 were the only @entity12 players in the team			2
this year there are concerns that @entity140 , who has been outstanding for @entity141 this season , may be the only @entity12 named at next sunday ’s awards			0
@entity112 , who is still a key member of @entity6 ’s squad , is the last @entity12 player to have won the @entity146 award in 2010			2
