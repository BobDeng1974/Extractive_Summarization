by @entity0 a new menu of one - dollar ' cravings ' has been unveiled by @entity3 with around a dozen items priced for a buck			1
11 choices , some of which have been around for a while , are priced at $ 1.00 each			1
the fast - food chain has introduced its menu as other fast food chains such as @entity13 have been moving away from their one - dollar concept and towards a more value - orientated price board			2
however , for some options on the dollar menu , charging $ 1 for some items actually represents an increase in price			1
$ 1.00 menu : the fast food chain unveiled a new " @entity25 " menu , with around a dozen items priced for a buck			1
for the historically cheap chain , in some cases that actually represents an increase in price			2
going up : soft potato taco was 99 cents but will now cost a dollar filling : triple - layer nachos - the $ 1 price point for these items is meant to present a compelling and tempting alternative the chain already had four items on the menu for less than a dollar			1
the @entity42 and @entity43 used to cost 89 cents , and the @entity44 and @entity45 were 99 cents each			1
they 're now on the dollar menu , meaning they ’re actually more expensive			1
@entity3 will earn a little extra money on a few items , and the chain expects customers to buy more than one item			1
@entity55 crunchy tostada shell topped with hearty beans , crisp lettuce , real cheese , tangy red sauce and creamy chipotle sauce			2

going up in price : @entity42 and @entity43 used to cost 89 cents but is going up more than 10 % new addition : beefy fritos			1
the move comes at a time when other big players in fast food , notably @entity119 ’s and @entity120 , have been shifting away from dollar menus toward more value - oriented pricing ' consumers loved getting their own variety of dollar menu items to create their own unique meals , ' said @entity127 , vice president of brand marketing			2
as the price rises at other chains , @entity3 wants to stand out by staying low			0
' what we heard from customers is that they ’re looking to get the most for their dollar , ' said @entity127			0
and having $ 1 items - no matter how few - remains important			2
other options on @entity3 ’s new @entity25 menu include the @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , and @entity143			0
the $ 1 price point could be a compelling and tempting alternative to options like the @entity119 ’s @entity147			0
overall , @entity3 has always been historically cheap with offers like burritos for 59 ¢ and 79 ¢			0
the $ 1.00 menu could mean that some customers might actually end up paying more as they buy more of the ' cheaper ' options .			0
