the @entity12 747 , which was carrying @entity13 host @entity2 and his girlfriend , the singer and accress @entity3 , was not even one hour into the journey from @entity17 to @entity18 when it was forced to land again after passengers and crew started to feel unwell			1

' our pilots used their training and experience throughout and the flight landed normally at @entity34			2
' we provided hotels for the customers and we will be rebooking customers onto alternative flights out of @entity34 as soon as possible			1
' the news comes just one week after it was revealed a @entity7 @entity12 was forced to make an emergency landing in @entity56 , as it made its way from @entity18 to @entity58 , after suspected toxic oil fumes were reported on the flight deck			1
