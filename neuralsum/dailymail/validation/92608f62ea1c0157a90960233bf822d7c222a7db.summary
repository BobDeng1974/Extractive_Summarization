@entity0 has suffered a fierce backlash from teachers who yesterday branded her ' misguided ' for snubbing a major union conference			1
the @entity5 said she had been ' repeatedly ' invited to speak at the event but had ' chosen not to attend '			2
the union also accused her of ' cynicism ' over her rhetoric on teachers ' workload and said it was now clear this was ' just a major pr exercise '			1
@entity0 has suffered a backlash from teachers who said she was ' misguided ' for snubbing a union conference it comes as members are due to debate possible industrial action over teachers ' pay , which could take place after the general election			1
the row is likely to put a damper on mrs @entity32 's efforts to placate the teachers ' unions after taking over from @entity35 last year			1
she earned herself the nickname of ' ms u-turn ' after a series of apparent departures from her predecessor 's policies , but now it appears her attempt to reverse mr @entity35 's war with the unions may be faltering			2
at the weekend , she was attacked by @entity48 , the biggest teachers ' union , for failing to accept an invitation to address their conference in @entity53			2
and according to the @entity5 , this year 's conference in @entity55 will be the first in recent history where there will be no representative mp from the government			1
speaking yesterday ahead of the event , general secretary @entity61 said : ' she was invited repeatedly			0
she has chosen not to attend , we do n't know why she 's not attending			0
' i think that 's not a good place for the new secretary of state for education in a coalition government to be			0
' if she really cared about teachers and if she really cared about their working lives , and the work that they 're doing and the issues that they want to raise , then she would come			0
' she 's missing an important means to engage with teachers			0
' @entity61 , general secretary of @entity48 , said it gave ' such a bad message ' that mrs @entity32 would not go to the major union conference dr @entity61 pointed out that mrs @entity32 had chosen to speak to head teachers at the @entity81 at the weekend			1
@entity83 schools minister @entity82 was also invited to the @entity5 event , but sent a ' personal apology ' for not being able to make it , she said			0
she said of mrs @entity32 : ' i think it 's just so misguided and gives such a bad message , to be able to go and speak to school leaders but not to be able to speak to teachers			1
' what is she afraid of ? would she at atl get a bad reception ? no. would she be jeered or shouted at ? no. she would get tough questioning , but she would get a perfectly polite , and perfectly courteous hearing			0
' i would have thought it would be a major platform for her to speak directly to the profession , and she 's chosen not to do so			0
i think it 's a big mistake			0
' she also attacked mrs @entity32 's pledge to help reduce teachers ' workloads , which included a promise not to make alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in ' exceptional circumstances '			1
the measures followed a survey launched by mrs @entity32 last october called the @entity114 survey , which generated 44,000 returns			1
at the time , she drew praise from unions after hailing teachers as ' heroes ' for their efforts in the classroom			2
but dr @entity61 said yesterday : ' the government 's response , in our view , shows that this was merely a cynical attempt to get 44,000 teachers ' email addresses and to appear to be interested in the issue of workload			2
' ' in our view , the workload challenge was just a major @entity132 exercise with no serious , significant policy response			0
' on tuesday , the @entity5 committee will be asked to campaign for a ' significant pay rise ' for the education sector and to discuss ' joint action ' with sister unions			1
the resolution argues that teachers have lost the equivalent of 15 per cent in their pay packets over the past few years			0
a government spokesperson said : ' the secretary of state recently approved a pay deal which gives heads the freedom to offer their best and most experienced teachers a 2 per cent pay rise , something that is only possible because we trust heads and governors to decide how to reward their staff			0
' they said of the @entity5 conference : ' the secretary of state will not be able to attend because of diary commitments			1
