all cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the ' old @entity126 '			0
it 's been gutted after the $ 17 million sale fell through @entity129 selling agent @entity60			2

the luxurious pool - side look ( above ) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners			0
the current version ( below ) shows @entity101 's highest positioned pool and spa , but little else as it is now			0
the luxurious pool - side look has gone to make way for a new look from new owners			0
the current version shows @entity101 's highest positioned pool and spa , but little else they took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $ 16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit - out ' look , we had to admit that it ( the fit - out ) that was there was not very appealing , so we decided that it needed to be ripped up			1
' ' it 's unique , a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse , so we began by stripping it right back to a shell , that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too , ' mr @entity60 added			1
the @entity45 starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels			2
' there 's not much left from how we found it , ' he said			0
at least the bbq is still in place			0
one of the biggest talking points all along for the @entity45 has been the swimming pool and spa area , the highest of their kind anywhere in @entity101 eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area had been cleared out prior to the auction however , @entity60 added it had some serious appeal			2
it 's position at more than 220 metres above the ground , four levels ( 70 - 73 ) , boasting ' the highest swimming pool and spa in @entity101 ' , no less than eight secure basement car spaces ( which have also had fittings removed ) and ' full resort facilities including pools , gym and gardens '			1
' this will give them ( buyers ) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in @entity22 , and create a residence of world - class standing			2
' you have spectacular views - out to the @entity209 to the west , you look east out to the ocean , then up to @entity212 ( @entity213 ) in the north and all the way down to @entity216 down south , to be fair the previous lay - out did not do that justice			0
' the auction that saw @entity5 one more @entity22 property richer , took place on march 7			1
' you look up to @entity212 ( @entity213 ) and all the way down to @entity216 down south , to be fair the previous lay - out did not do that justice ' said mr @entity60 with views like this , it 's little wonder mr @entity228 claims ' there has been plenty of local and international interest ' about @entity126 - the @entity45 on the @entity16 which had been stripped bare			1
