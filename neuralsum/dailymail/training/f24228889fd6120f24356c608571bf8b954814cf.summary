he treated his 17 sons and daughters like cash cows – generating a staggering benefits income of £ 60,000 a year			1
yesterday , @entity5 remained shameless to the last			0
the drug - taking layabout , who embodies everything that is wrong with the welfare state , was still smiling even after being convicted of killing six of his children			0
@entity14 : a court drawing shows the moment @entity5 , wife @entity17 and friend @entity18 were found guilty of deliberately starting a fire which claimed the lives of six of the @entity23 's children co-conspirators : @entity5 and @entity18 appeared at a press conference ( left ) in a tearful ruse to appeal for information after the fire last year			1
they are pictured ( right ) on their wedding day in may 2003 together with his wife @entity17 and friend @entity18 , he plotted to set fire to the family home in an appalling attempt to frame @entity5 ’s former live - in lover @entity37			1
the deadly gamble was to save the six youngsters , blame @entity40 , and win back custody of five children who had recently moved out of the cramped three - bedroom semi with her			1
a bigger council house was also on the agenda			1
as the cynical trio were found guilty at @entity49 of manslaughter , @entity5 ’s sister - in - law , @entity47 , screamed : ‘ you murdering b * * * * * * *			1
i knew it from day one			0
’ incredibly , the tragic @entity54 were not being regularly monitored by social workers despite dangerous living conditions and their father ’s notorious appearances on national television where he boasted of his sex - obsessed and benefits - funded lifestyle			2
@entity5 pictured with the six children , aged between five and 13 , who perished in the house fire destroyed : the children perished when the fire tore through their home ( above ) in @entity68 , last may plot : a @entity70 photo showing the ladder ( left ) which @entity5 placed at the back of the house as part of his plan to rescue his children after starting the fire sordid : the caravan where @entity5 used to sleep with his wife and mistress on alternate nights as an inquiry was launched into the case , it also emerged that : scorched : the charred landing reveals just how fierce the fire was when it ripped through the house ravaged : the petrol - fuelled blaze broke out in the hallway of the home where @entity5 lived with wife @entity17 , 31 , and their own six children - all of whom perished as they slept yesterday @entity5 , 56 , shouted obscenities before saying ‘ it ’s not over yet ’ moments after mrs @entity100 asked for the verdicts to be received in silence ‘ out of respect for the memories ’ of the children he had killed			1
but with typical arrogance , @entity5 , who infamously appeared on the @entity107 to demand a bigger council house , crossed himself , waved and smiled as he was led away			1
the court heard how @entity5 lived with his wife , @entity40 and their combined 11 children in his cramped three - bedroom council house in @entity114 , @entity68			1
doomed : firefighters said the children would not have been able to survive the intense heat and thick smoke spread rapidly : from the moment the fire was set in the hallway , the flames would have surged up the @entity124 front door , melting the plastic , and quickly progressed up the staircase , firefighters said but he was left irate after @entity40 , 29 , became disillusioned with his ‘ domineering behaviour ’ and summoned the courage to escape the unconventional family home with her five children early last year			1
that decision to leave , taking with her more than £ 1,000 a month in benefit payments , was the ‘ catalyst for everything that was to follow ’			0
miss @entity37 , a cleaner , was due to face @entity5 at a custody hearing just hours after the blaze and @entity5 became the ‘ driving force ’ of a heinous plan to set her up , the court heard			1
ignited : the door to the hallway where the fire was started with petrol fire - starter : a petrol can that was found near the property in @entity152 after the blaze evidence : @entity70 photo of a glove and @entity158 bottle found near the scene of the fire ' upsetting and shocking case : ' assistant chief constable @entity162 ( centre ) of @entity164 issues a statement outside @entity49 after the verdicts he began telling friends she had threatened his home and his children , something he would ‘ use in court to get his children back ’			2
less than a fortnight before the fire , he reported to police that she had made a telephone threat to kill him			0
@entity5 calculated that a fire could also land him a new , bigger council house – something he had been demanding from the local authority ever since his notorious appearance on @entity107 in 2006			1
no hope : thick , black smoke would have quickly filled each of the rooms from floor to ceiling , rendering the six children ( clockwise from top left ) - @entity193 , 13 , @entity194 , 10 , @entity195 , nine , @entity196 , six , @entity197 , five , and @entity198 , eight - unconscious in minutes killed by their own parents : six wooden crosses mark the graves of the @entity5 children young lives destroyed : the six coffins carrying the @entity207 's children are carried into @entity209 's @entity208 for their funeral last year community in shock : floral tributes adorn the pavement outside the house @entity5 shared with @entity17 in @entity114 , @entity68 , after the fire on may 14 last year on may 11 last year , after @entity5 had a sordid sex session with his wife and @entity18 on their home snooker table , the fire was lit , with the intention that the six children sleeping upstairs would be saved through an upstairs window , with @entity5 both ‘ the hero and the victim ’			1
but the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong			0
too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving @entity5 unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching @entity232			2
@entity233 , ten , and brothers @entity193 , 13 , @entity195 , nine , @entity198 , eight , @entity235 , six and @entity197 , five , all died of smoke inhalation			0
denied charges : a drawing of @entity5 breaking down in the witness box as he gives evidence during the trial denial : @entity18 tells jurors she did n't know who had started the fire because she was asleep in the dock : @entity5 ( second from left ) and wife @entity17 ( second from right ) appear at @entity49 along with co-defendant @entity18 ( right ) ahead of their trial facing justice : a prison van carrying @entity252 and @entity18 and @entity18 at @entity49 for the start of the trial in february taking it in : @entity256 , the father of @entity18 , hugs daughter @entity47 , outside after the verdicts difficult time : @entity18 's father @entity256 ( pictured hugging his daughter @entity47 ) said he had difficulty accepting his daughter 's involvement facing jail : @entity263 and @entity5 embrace at their home after the fire , the brand of petrol which was discovered on the clothing of all three defendants was also found in the u-bend of the sink inside the house			1
petrol on @entity5 ’s clothing was also found inside the front door			2
he simply claimed that fuel was found because he had not washed for three months			0
while his wife was seen to be distraught , @entity5 was overheard afterwards saying : ‘ it was n’t meant to end like this			2
’ during a fortnight of surveillance at the hotel where they were put up by police in may , the couple were heard whispering about the case , with @entity5 recorded telling his wife to ‘ stick to your story ’			2
the couple were charged by police on may 30 in connection with the deaths and @entity18 was arrested in the months afterwards , having told a friend the plan had been for him to rescue the children			0
police initially charged the trio with murder but downgraded this to manslaughter because while their actions were sickeningly reckless , the defendants had not intended to kill the six			0
yesterday @entity5 ’s sister , @entity305 , said his family believed ‘ justice has been served ’			1
‘ this past year has been a very difficult time for our family as we have had to come to terms with what @entity252 and @entity17 and @entity18 have done , ’ she said			2
‘ we can now attempt to move on and our six angels can rest in peace			0
’ @entity5 was raking in £ 60,000 a year as a result of his ' three - way relationship ' , police say			1
the cash was paid to both @entity319 and his wife @entity17 , both part time cleaners , in working tax credits and child benefit for the total of 11 children they raised with @entity5			1
although he was not claiming any benefits himself , the five - figure sum was channeled straight into his bank account as he refused to let the women manage their own financial affairs			0
during the trial , prosecutor @entity332 said : ' @entity18 did not want to work			0
he just wanted a house full of kids and the benefit money that brings			0
' the last full - time job @entity5 had was in 1991 as a bakery manager			0
since then he has done odd jobs for cash , including running pub trips			0
mrs @entity18 ’s family said the children had been taken away in the ‘ cruellest way imaginable by the very people who were supposed to love and protect them			2
’ her sister @entity47 , who was ejected from the courtroom , said she was convinced of the @entity350 ’ guilt from the outset			0
@entity164 said a serious case review will examine ‘ @entity17 ’s role as a mother ’ as well as the extent of any involvement social services may have had with the family			2
@entity359 , of @entity360 , said questions would be asked as to ‘ whether there are immediate changes that need to be made to the way local services operate to safeguard children ’			2
‘ the local safeguarding children board will review the work of the agencies involved , even if , as in this case , the children were not subject to child protection plans or legal orders , ’ he added			0
@entity374 assistant chief constable @entity162 described the crimes as ‘ an evil , stupid , shameful act ’			0
he added that @entity5 ’s erratic behaviour since the fire , including a ‘ childlike performance ’ at the infamous police press conference , has been nothing more than a ‘ sham ’ .			1

@entity5 treated his children like cash cows generating £ 60,000 a year in benefits
he plotted to set fire to the family home with his wife @entity17 to frame @entity5 ’s former live - in lover @entity37

he was jailed for trying to kill a *schoolgirl* lover , stabbing her *27* times after she ended their relationship
he planned to ‘ get rich quick ’ – turning funeral funds donated by the local community into @entity414 *vouchers*
