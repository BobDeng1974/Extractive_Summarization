a swan has been grounded for his own safety after falling head over heels in love with a helicopter			1
the bird - called @entity7 - has developed an unusual attachment to the £ 6million chopper and tries to fly up to meet it every time it comes into land			1
@entity7 has been looking for a new mate for the past two years in the skies over @entity15 and @entity16 on the @entity17 of @entity18 after losing his partner			1
but instead of falling for a fellow bird he ’s become obsessed with the dark - coloured @entity21 that regularly lands at the adjacent airstrip			1
air traffic controllers at @entity39 say the infatuated swan recognises the five - tonne chopper ’s twin - engines whenever it flies in			0
@entity7 immediately takes to the skies to try and reach it before chasing it down the runway , then sitting and nestling by it until its owner flies off again			2
but the helicopter 's pilot is so terrified the besotted bird - named after its species the whooper swan - will fly into its rotor blades they ’ve been forced to clip his wings			1
@entity58 , who works at the golf club , said bosses had no option but to ground the swan			0
lonely bird : @entity7 has been looking for a new partner since his mate died two years ago looking for love : @entity7 was often found nestling against the helicopter and soared into the air whenever he spotted it in the skies he said : ' he lost his mate a couple of years ago and has been flying high around the area looking for a mate			1
' apparently he has taken a fancy to a helicopter up at the airport and so as responsible owners we decided to get his wings clipped by a vet			2
' we have lots of other swans here but we do n’t have any other whooper swans			0
' he seems very happy but i would like to find him a female white swan - but this is @entity18 and there are n’t many around			0
' so if anyone can help me find him a mate that would be brilliant			0
it would also stop him flying around the airport when his feathers grown back			0
' the 200mph @entity27 can carry up to 13 passengers along with two crew members and is normally used to ferry private passengers and @entity96			2
neighbours : the @entity27 helicopter is based at an airstrip opposite the golf and country club where @entity7 is based grounded : staff at the @entity103 and @entity16 in @entity18 were eventually forced to clip the wings of @entity7 the swan for his own safety the chopper ’s owner is understood to be a wealthy businessman who lives on @entity110 and regularly hops between the two islands			1
a @entity39 spokesman confirmed that @entity7 had created a potential hazard by ' flirting ' with the incoming aircraft			2
