leading gps are in revolt over a controversial @entity3 scheme to pay them £ 55 for every new case of dementia they record			1

leading gps are in revolt over a controversial @entity3 scheme to pay them £ 55 for every new case of dementia they record practices will be paid £ 55 for every new case recorded until april			1
but more than 50 leading gps , academics and campaigners have written to the head of the @entity3 , @entity29 , and @entity30 , the national clinical director for dementia , voicing ‘ serious concerns ’			1
in a joint letter , published in the @entity34 , they warn that ‘ misdiagnosis is a real possibility ’ as dementia is difficult to confirm in the early stages and often based on a doctor ’s opinion			1
they fear it could lead to patients being wrongly labelled as having the illness which would incur ‘ truly tragic consequences ’ , as the diagnosis would cause huge anxiety and distress for patients and their families and it could be years before mistakes were realised			1
it goes on to say that the scheme sets a ‘ dangerous precedent ’ and risks undermining patients ’ trust			1
the letter was written by dr @entity58 , a gp from @entity60 , @entity61 , who is regarded as an authority on dementia , and signed by @entity65 , chief executive of the @entity67 , as well as a number of @entity70 and @entity71 academics			0

professor @entity112 , @entity94 deputy chief executive , said : ‘ every hospital fall costs on average £ 1,215			2

’ dr @entity58 said last night : ‘ they should n’t be asking us to do this and i really do n’t want to have anything to do with this money at all			2
‘ we should n’t be in a position where money comes into the moment of diagnosis – there should n’t be incentives			0
’ other leading @entity131 who have put their names to the letter include @entity134 , former president of the @entity135 and @entity136 , previously chairman of the @entity131 committee at the @entity139			2
