if you 're a fan of @entity2 , then judgment promises not to disappoint			0
but for those looking for revolutionary gameplay , emotional storytelling and deep , multifaceted level design , you may want to look elsewhere			1
make no mistake , new developer @entity7 - behind the brilliant @entity8 - have honed and perfected everything that makes a @entity12 of game great			1
sadly , given how far the third - person genre has come since the @entity2 ' inception in 2006 , the welcome changes and modifications ca n't hide the tired gameplay			1
all together now : most of the time , your teammates ' @entity19 works well but the same ca n't be same for the @entity21 set as a prequel and told in flashback after the events of @entity12 , plot follows the adventures of @entity27 as they endeavour to save @entity28 from a @entity21 chief called @entity30			0
familiar faces @entity32 and @entity33 are joined by new recruits @entity35 and @entity36			0
unfortunately , although it 's interesting seeing the youthful exuberance of @entity32 and @entity33 , character development pales in comparison to its predecessors			1
there are no moments - such as the devastating death of @entity46 's wife @entity45 in the second game - that stick with you			1
instead , battles are largely forgettable - but that 's not to say they 're not fun			1
there are more enemies on screen than ever before and @entity19 is ( largely ) smart enough to stop you camping and gunning down @entity21 at ease			0
levels are now split up into sections - each one containing a ' @entity60 ' optional mission			1
here , you can choose to add a variant to the level - for example allowing a toxic gas to impair vision or replace easier enemies with tougher ones			1
successful completion of levels and declassified missions rewards you with medals - which essentially act as bragging rights to other @entity2 players			2
this , coupled with levels featuring frequent mini ' hordes ' ( where you must take on waves of enemies ) makes the entire thing feel more ' arcade - like ' than ever before - a move that may jar with some hardcore fans			1
what will be universally appreciated , though , are the visuals			2
judgment is easily the prettiest of the bunch			0
whether it 's watching @entity33 grimace as he mangles a @entity21 with his chainsaw @entity92 or roadie - running across intricately bump - mapped cobbled streets , @entity88 is a visual tour - de - force			2
multiplayer , too , is a triumph			2
overrun mode - where a team must stop a horde of locust troops from opening @entity101 - is a particular highlight			1
this coupled with an easy - to - use class and xp system means there 's still plenty of life left after the 10 - or - so hour campaign draws to a close			2
death from above : enemies come at you thick and fast making firefights exciting			0
but by the end of the campaign you would have had your fill there 's no denying that @entity88 is a good third - person shooter , and , if released a few years back it would be one of the greatest			0
but gamers ' demands have caused the third - person genre to evolve - with many wanting more than just gunning down enemies , walking to another room and doing the same over and over again			0
the game has changed and gears are beginning to grind			0
@entity2 : judgment is out now in the @entity131 and released on march 22 in @entity132			0
watch the latest trailer here : follow us on @entity136 : @ @entity137 and on @entity138 : @entity139 .			0

new developers @entity7 have *tweaked* gameplay to perfection
visuals are the best in the *series*
not a particularly engaging story and lack of character development
gameplay feels *slightly* stale and ' arcade - like ' level design may jar with hardcore fans
strong multiplayer - especially overrun mode
