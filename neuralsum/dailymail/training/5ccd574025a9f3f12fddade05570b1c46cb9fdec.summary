beaming : @entity0 , 48 , was able to avoid a hysterectomy thanks to @entity3 - guided @entity2 a revolutionary no - knife procedure is being used to treat fibroids – and it could save thousands of women from a hysterectomy			1
it uses a high - energy , focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic – resulting in a far shorter recovery time			1
the beam is guided through continuous @entity17 ( @entity17 ) that allows the surgical team to see inside the body			1
‘ this is a revolutionary procedure , ’ says consultant interventional radiologist dr @entity20 , who offers the treatment at @entity23 hospital in @entity24			1
he has treated 15 cases so far in collaboration with consultant gynaecologist @entity28			2
‘ as well as needing no general anaesthetic , it is non-invasive			2
recovery is faster and there are few risks of complication or side effects			2
’ fibroids are common tumours on the wall of the uterus and are usually benign			1
‘ about 25 per cent of women of child - bearing age have them , and up to 40 per cent in later life , ’ says dr @entity20			1
‘ although some women have no idea they even have them , a substantial number need treatment			1
’ treatment is recommended if the fibroids cause symptoms , which can include heavy bleeding , pressure on the bladder or bowel – meaning increased urination , bloating or constipation – or fertility problems			1
‘ there is an association with early miscarriage , or in later pregnancy there may be a problem with space , ’ says dr @entity20			2
‘ it ’s not known why they cause heavy bleeding but they grow in response to oestrogen			0
’ most treatments involve surgery , with many women having a hysterectomy – removal of the uterus			1
half the 50,000 hysterectomies done on the @entity81 every year are fibroid - related			1
this operation can take two hours under general anaesthetic , requires a hospital stay and patients can take eight weeks to recover			2
company director @entity0 , 48 , was advised to have a hysterectomy when she developed fibroids			1
she had been suffering heavy bleeding			0
‘ some days i could n’t leave the bathroom , ’ she says			0
‘ it was a nightmare			0
i was dragging myself to work every day , through the school run and supper , and could n’t ride my beloved horses for more than ten minutes without being exhausted			0
’ after several months , her doctor found she was anaemic and prescribed @entity94 , a progesterone contraceptive injection that often stops periods altogether			0
when that did n’t work , @entity0 had a scan			1
‘ the radiologist said i had fibroids so large it was as if i was carrying an 18 - week foetus , ’ she recalls			1
how it is done : @entity105 uses a high - energy , focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic the gynaecologist recommended a hysterectomy			1
‘ i was convinced there must be another solution			0
i could n’t bear more time away from work and my family			0
i went home and sat at my laptop – when i found the new procedure it seemed ideal			2
’ the @entity3 - guided @entity2 ( @entity122 ) can be done in a few hours under light sedation			1
symptoms start to diminish immediately			0
the @entity81 was happy to consider funding @entity122 for @entity0 , but she could n’t face waiting so had it privately			1
after light sedation , the patient lies very still on the stomach in an mri scanner with the fibroid directly over the ultrasound			0
the surgical team plot and guide the treatment from a control room using the @entity17 console			1
‘ it was n’t the most fun four hours , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ but i was n’t in any pain			0
you have to stay completely still but the main problem is feeling chilly and a bit bored			0
every now and again the ultrasound beam bounces off the pelvis and you feel discomfort			0
but i had a button to press if this happened , and the second i did so they moved the beam			0
i went home and had an excellent night ’s sleep with just a couple of painkillers			0
’ two days later the bleeding had eased significantly , and continued to tail off over the following weeks			0
consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist @entity154 says : ‘ the science is excellent , with good clinical trials , and could be fantastic in certain situations			0
though fibroids have to be on the front of the uterus with no bowel in between and ca n’t be too large			2
the procedure is likely to become popular			2
’ dr @entity20 adds : ‘ occasionally there may be some redness , minor pain , skin burns or bruising			0
these usually resolve within ten days			0
’ the treated fibroids will not grow back but there is a small risk of new ones growing			2
‘ i went in on the thursday and was back at work on monday , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ my life has been changed			0

new no - knife procedure could save thousands from hysterectomy
@entity0 , 48 , was rid of fibroids after new @entity17 treatment
@entity3 - guided @entity2 takes only a few hours
