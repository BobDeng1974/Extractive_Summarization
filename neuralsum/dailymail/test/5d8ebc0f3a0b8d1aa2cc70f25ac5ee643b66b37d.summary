@entity1 ringleaders @entity2 and @entity3 will today find out if their last - ditch legal appeal against their death row sentence will be allowed to proceed			1
a @entity7 court is due to decide whether the pair ’s lawyers can challenge @entity12 president @entity11 ’s decision to deny the two @entity14 clemency			1
the unusual appeal in the state administrative court is likely the pair 's last legal avenue to save them from the firing squad for their part in the 2005 @entity1 heroin smuggling bid			2
@entity24 men @entity3 , 31 , and @entity2 , 33 , are currently awaiting execution on the death island of nusakambangan with seven other prisoners after they were transferred from their home of almost ten years – @entity31 ’s notorious @entity30 prison – in a dramatic show of force , over a month ago			2
if it overturns this decision on monday , lawyers will then argue mr @entity11 did not fulfil his obligations when he issued a blanket rejection of clemency to @entity3 and @entity2 , as he plans to do to more than 50 other death row drug offenders			1
if the court upholds its earlier decision , it 's not known what move the lawyers will take next in their efforts to spare the men			2
lawyer for @entity3 and @entity2 , @entity66 , last week said they had done their best for their @entity14 clients			0
president @entity11 previously rejected the @entity14 pair 's clemency bids the pair are currently being held in isolation on the prison island family members of @entity14 death row prisoners @entity3 and @entity2 leave nusakambangan prison island after visiting the two prisoners on march 9 on sunday , @entity7 's catholic archbishop , @entity80 , told reporters he was saddened by @entity12 's use of the death penalty , which he described as a " failure of humanity "			1
also distressing for the archbishop was the severe treatment of @entity3 and @entity2 when they were moved last month from their @entity31 jail cells to nusakambangan , which involved a fighter jet escort			1
" these men were handcuffed , was it necessary to be guarded by @entity99 ? " he told reporters after his @entity96 service			0
a smiling @entity100 , the police commissioner of the @entity31 capital of @entity102 , poses for a photo with his hand upon the shoulder of condemned prisoner @entity3 inside the plane before take off for the @entity14 @entity1 kingpin 's final flight to the island where he will be executed surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return , 33 - year - old @entity14 @entity2 looks up at @entity31 police commissioner @entity100 who posed with the two condemned @entity14 before their take off from @entity102 airport for the two hour flight to ' death island ' " for me that 's not strictness , for me that 's very saddening because it 's obvious that power wants to show itself and human dignity is not cherished			1
" @entity7 is awaiting all of the 10 prisoners in line for the firing squad to run out of options for court appeals before setting a date for their executions			0
@entity2 and @entity3 are facing execution alongside @entity133 woman @entity132 , @entity135 citizen @entity134 , @entity137 citizen @entity136 and the only @entity12 citizen among the group @entity140			0
