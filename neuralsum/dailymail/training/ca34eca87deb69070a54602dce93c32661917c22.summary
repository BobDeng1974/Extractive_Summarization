a self - styled vigilante has been staging citizen 's arrests on @entity4 drivers around @entity5			1
@entity6 , a limo driver who has been previously affiliated with @entity7 , says he is fighting back against the ride - sharing app which he labels a ' blatantly illegal operation '			1
customers who use the @entity4 service get cut - price fairs by taking trips in private cars driven by members of the public			2
but mr @entity6 argues that @entity4 drivers are often unaware that what they are doing is breaking the law under the @entity20 , and they face fines of up to $ 110,000 if caught			1
he said his background , including two years in the advanced riot squad and counter-terrorism , would help him in his quest to @entity35			0
' i know i have the connections , the resolve , and i have the complex methodologies , ' he said			0
' i have a unique skill set built up over many years in my previous employ and that is to take on these kinds of criminal organisations in ways they have n't anticipated			0
' the reason i talk about my background in policing is to say that i know what i 'm doing in relation to these arrests - i understand the law			2
' the @entity54 filmed mr @entity6 conducting one of his arrests during a ride - along with a hidden camera			1
in the video , he books an @entity4 in the @entity60 and strikes up a conversation with the driver , who appears to be unaware that operating an @entity4 is against the law			1
after they get out of the car mr @entity6 informs the driver he is placing the man under citizen 's arrest			2
mr @entity6 ( pictured in red circle ) said his policing background , including two years in the advanced riot squad and counter-terrorism , would help him in his quest to ' stop ' @entity7 police attended the scene but the driver later told the @entity54 he did n't receive any warning or fine from police and was reassured by @entity7 than he was not doing anything illegal			1
a @entity83 police spokeswoman said the matter was subject to a police investigation and ' it is not appropriate to comment further '			0
mr @entity6 said until earlier this month he had been an uber partner for two years , helping to sign drivers and passengers to the app. ' i brought probably like a third of the cars they had on in their first year , ' he said			2
' in terms of clients easily over 500 - 1000 passengers			0
' but he said he changed his tune because he disagreed with the way @entity7 operated			2
' i realised i could n't be part of the lie , ' he said			0
' i would have been rewarded handsomely for it if i convinced more drivers to come on their illegal platform			2
' i just thought if i 'm not going to be with them i 'm actually going to try to stop them			0
' mr @entity6 argues that @entity4 drivers are often unaware that what they are doing is breaking the law under the @entity110 mr @entity6 said he has been labelled a ' thug ' but asserts he has never used excessive force during his arrests			1
' i am clearly not fighting individual drivers â€“ i 'm clearly fighting @entity7			1
' @entity7 is coercing , manipulating and exploiting these people - not @entity6			1
' and if @entity6 was n't out there arresting them every now and then they would still be out there committing these offences			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity7 said mr @entity6 had been ' harassing ' a number of drivers and the company had reported him to authorities			1
' @entity6 claims to represent a taxi industry that has not faced any competition in decades and , through its association with mr @entity6 , is now resorting to open intimidation and threats of force to those who dare to provide an alternative service , ' she said			0
' hundreds of thousands of riders have taken millions of trips in @entity137 and we are growing exponentially week on week			0
the spokeswoman said @entity7 has signed up 1100 new drivers last month , adding that not one of the drivers mr @entity6 has ' harassed ' has left @entity7			1
a spokeswoman for @entity7 said @entity6 had been ' harassing ' a number of partners and the company had reported him to authorities ' with the taxi industry now threatening violence against @entity7 partners , we call on governments to remove the ambiguity around ridesharing , begin its promised consultation process and provide certainty to the the thousands of @entity35 partners who are working to provide for themselves and their families , ' she said			1
the @entity160 denies any affiliation with mr @entity6 , but is critical of the app and other ride - sharing services			1
' the issue here , setting aside his actions , is there is a prevailing sense of injustice among our industry , ' said @entity160 ceo @entity171			0
' from the fact that [ registered taxi drivers ] do right thing , they comply with the law , they have to pay all of their obligations , have cameras in their cars , pay for proper insurance , yet they see people thumbing their nose at the law and operating illegally			2
' @entity83 transport minister said @entity188 there were serious safety issues to consider			0
' this is a complex issue and cities all around the world are grappling with it as we speak , ' ms @entity188 said in a statement			0
mr @entity6 said he has been labelled a ' thug ' but asserts he has never used excessive force in his arrests ' here in @entity83 we have been very clear that it is illegal for drivers to participate in what we call " ride - sharing " activities like @entity202 ' @entity204 has issued several fines of thousands of dollars for those breaking the law and @entity204 will also be initiating legal action before the end of the year against motorists engaged in driving for @entity202 ' a spokeswoman for @entity212 says @entity213 does not breach the @entity20 1990 by offering the service , but drivers transporting passengers for a fare do			1
' taxi and hire car services in @entity83 must be provided by an accredited operator authorised by roads and @entity222 , ' she said			0
' authorised drivers have relevant criminal history and medical checks			0
this is to ensure the safety of customers and drivers			0
' the spokeswoman added that on the spot fines of between $ 500 and $ 1000 have been issued to drivers for offences including ' drive private hire vehicle without authority ' , but drivers could find themselves facing $ 110,000 fines before a court .			1
