@entity0 has been accused of ' impersonating ' its users ' without their consent ' to secretly endorse items in the news feeds of their friends			1
critics say the social network is recycling users ' likes and using them to promote ' @entity11 ' about products and stories with which they may not want to be linked			1
in some cases users have even seen items ' liked ' by friends and relatives who are in fact no longer alive			1
' helps you connect and share ' : but it seems that @entity0 has been sharing content on its users ' behalf without their explicit consent - or even their knowledge the process is completely invisible to the users whose identities are being exploited , it is claimed , with the posts only showing up in the news feeds of friends and families			1
it happens when a user likes an advertiser 's @entity0 page			2
as would be expected , this ' like ' appears on the user 's page and is recorded on their activity log			2
however , an advertiser using @entity0 's @entity45 ad product can then take that ' like ' and attach it to related content promoted to the particular user 's friends as a ' @entity49 '			1
for example , if a user were to like @entity52 ' page on @entity0 and the coffee shop chain paid to advertise a new variety of coffee on the social network then that ' like ' could reappear on friends ' news feeds next to a @entity49 promoting the new product			1
in effect , once a user likes a particular brand , the social network then recycles that indication of approval for later ' @entity11 ' by that advertiser which the user may never have even seen			1
and there is no indication to the user that their ' like ' is being attached to such related content			2
@entity73 - based developer @entity72 said he first became aware that @entity0 was recycling his likes when a friend asked him if he liked ' penis - shaped waffles '			2
that shocking association spurred him to investigate the phenomenon using a fake account , and he has posted a video to @entity82 documenting what he found out			0
' @entity0 is impersonating people without their consent , and most individuals have no idea this is happening , ' he wrote in a related article on @entity90			0
' @entity0 is impersonating people without their consent ' : this screengrab from a @entity82 video by @entity72 shows where his fake account set up to investigate @entity11 is linked to an article he showed how the feature works by using his fake account to like pop culture magazine vice , then logging in with his genuine account to find that identity was linked by a @entity49 to a risque story published by his website			1
however , logging back into the face account showed that the @entity104 was completely invisible to the user , and there was no way of finding out about that the identity and the story were linked , or to withdraw consent			0
' this goes beyond just advertising on a user ’s behalf , ' he wrote			0
' [ m ] y friends & family might think i like inappropriate content , or information i do n’t agree with - it can damage relationships			0
' in the cases highlighted by mr @entity72 each story was labelled as ' related ' , but apart from that the posts looked like any other and with no explanation of what ' related ' meant in that context			0
the accusations come even as @entity0 agreed to a $ 20million settlement of a class - action lawsuit brought by users angry about their identities being linked to @entity45 on the site			2
the lawsuit alleged the adverts are a violation of privacy that unwittingly turns users into spokesmen for products without their approval			0
and that is not the worst of what @entity0 is accused of			0
another @entity0 user last month documented a range of cases where friends had liked brands that seemed completely out of character			1
@entity11 are part of @entity0 's @entity45 product for advertisers			1
sponsored stories are based around content users have already interacted with on @entity0 by , for example , liking a particular brand 's page			1
advertisers can pay the social network to ensure that user 's friends see this interaction with a brand , but they can also publish fresh , related content alongside that like as a @entity49			1
in this way , users ' identities can be linked with content on the site that they may be entirely unaware of , let alone have endorsed			0
for example , if a user was to like the @entity0 page for @entity173 , and the sportswear brand was to publish fresh content on @entity0 about a new trainer they are marketing , then that user 's like could be republished to their friends alongside the post about the new footwear			1
indeed , in some cases highlighted by @entity184 on @entity185 , the person who had liked the item in question was no longer actually even alive			0
mr @entity184 conducted his own investigation by asking his friends whether they had liked the particular brands they had been linked with , and none said they had			0
after contacting @entity0 to ask them directly what was going on , a spokesman told him its possible these people liked the things they were linked on accidentally , perhaps by inadvertently pressing a button on the mobile app. the spokesman maintained that in the case of dead people liking things , it could be that the social network is recycling likes from when they were still alive			1
when contacted by @entity206 , @entity0 said that @entity45 were ' useful ' for giving ' social context ' to pages promoted on the site			2
' sponsored stories are based around content that people have already interacted with on @entity0 , for example a friend liking a page , ' a spokesman said			2
' @entity158 can pay to ensure you see this interaction , although the precise audience is government by an individual 's privacy settings			0
' for most of us the opinion of our friends is an important factor in how we view the world and many people find it useful to have this sort of social context when discovering new @entity0 pages			2
' however we also give people the option to opt out of @entity45			0
' when @entity0 users die , we ask that their families or close friends notify us so that we can memorialize the account			0
' that enables us to remove it from the @entity45 system			0

the social network is ' recycling ' likes alongside new , related content that the users may never have seen
when @entity0 attaches a user 's ' like ' to the new @entity49 content they do not inform them it has happened
in some cases users have even seen content and brands ' liked ' on the website by friends who are dead
@entity0 spokesman says the feature is part of the @entity45 ad product and users are able to opt out
