two babies who could n't breathe have been fitted with a revolutionary new ' throat splint ' made on a 3d printer			1
both @entity3 , 18 months , from @entity4 , and @entity5 , two , from @entity6 , were born with a condition called tracheomalacia , making their tracheas susceptible to collapsing and cutting off their air supplies , meaning they could potentially suffocate			1
doctors from the @entity13 created a @entity15 printed splint to support the trachea , acting as a type of scaffold and allowing for the area around it to heal			1
@entity3 was born with a weakened trachea , making him prone to suffocation			2
thanks to a new @entity15 printed splint he is recovering and is able to breathe more easily the @entity15 printed larynx support , which was created in four hours from a special plastic that will expand and grow while the patient does			1
in three years it will be completely dissolved , meaning it will not need to be removed surgically another advantage of the revolutionary technique is that , much like dissolvable stitches , they are broken down and absorbed by the body , meaning there is no need for further surgery to have them removed			1
made from a material called @entity41 , the splints are completely bio-compatible and the patient does not need immune - suppresants			1
3d printing is already used in the construction industry , to make guns , artwork and other miscellaneous items			0
now it has proven uses in surgery and medicine			2
the splint was created by the doctors at the @entity13 , who began by taking ct scans of @entity3 's throat and used a cad machine and a 3d printer to make the device surgeons carry out the eight - hour procedure on @entity3			1
despite his poor health , the operation went well the splint will stay in @entity3 's throat for three years before it is completely absorbed by the body , allowing for his trachea and windpipe to grow stronger @entity3 was born with a defective windpipe meaning that the slightest incident - from an accidental jostle to getting upset or crying - could cut off his breathing			1
his mother @entity74 from @entity75 , @entity4 , said : ' he could go from being totally fine to turning blue sometimes - not even kidding - in 30 seconds			0
' it was so fast , really scary			0
' when he got upset or even sometimes just with a diaper change , he would turn completely blue and that was terrifying			0
' his father @entity80 said : ' it 's just been issue after issue with breathing , and just trying to keep him breathing at all			0
' the same issue affected little @entity5 , whose parents april and @entity87 were also desperate for a solution			0
doctors gave @entity3 a low chance of recovery but he has grown stronger since the successful procedure mrs @entity5 said : ' quite a few doctors said he had a good chance of not leaving the hospital alive			2
' at that point , we were desperate			0
anything that would work , we would take it and run with it , ' she said			0
the @entity101 and the @entity102 turned to dr @entity103 and dr @entity104 at the @entity13 , who were developing 3d printing technology for medicine , using a machine that melts particles of plastic dust with a laser to craft shapes			1
doctors believe the technique could have other uses in medicine , including bone grafts and replacing body parts because @entity3 was a lot sicker , doctors had a lot less time to carry out the procedure of fitting the tube - like device			1
they did a ct scan of his windpipe so an exact replica could be printed			2
dr @entity104 said : ' in some sense we were thrown directly into the fire			0
' we characterized it as sort of a hail mary pass			0
' it 's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly			0
' while the technology is revolutionary , it requires open - chest surgery to implant the splint			2
the splint is made out of a special type of plastic called @entity41 , which , like dissolvable stitches , will be be absorbed by the body over time , so will not require surgery to remove it dr @entity103 said : ' ( @entity3 's ) condition was critical			1
it was urgent and things needed to be done quickly			0
it was highly questionable whether he would survive and how long he would survive			0
' after an eight - hour surgery , @entity3 was on the road to recovery and his parents said he had grown stronger			2
his splint is designed to grow and expand as he gets bigger and will dissolve completely within three years .			1

two children suffered from weak tracheas , meaning they were a high risk of suffocating
@entity13 doctors fitted them with @entity15 printed splints
devices designed to dissolve like stitches , removing the need for surgery
*scientists* hope the technique can be used in the *future* to replace body parts and for bone grafts
