after putting her passion on hold when she had her family , the 40 - year - old ’s work has become a hit after she put it online			2

what makes her face painting technique so unusual , is that unlike other special effects make up artists , she does not rely on any prosthetic materials to create her ‘ faces ’			1
@entity7 only uses paint and her natural talent to create celebrity faces , footballers , zombies , 3d effects and even gory cuts			1
@entity7 as @entity36 's maleficent from the cent hit film			1
she creates all her looks without using any prosthetics the @entity70 is recreated in incredible detail by the mother - of - two using just face paint and make - up unsurprisingly once @entity7 had posted her transformations into famous celebrity like @entity77 , they soon went viral as soon as she set up her make up page , her lifelike face painting went viral on @entity80			1
@entity7 ’s transformations , which have become known as ‘ famous faces ’ to her fans , also caught the eye of the @entity85 - commonly known as @entity86 , who have invited her to be a guest speaker this summer			1
the make up artist , who is originally from @entity91 , has always had a talent and passion for art , and particularly enjoyed pencil drawing and charcoal sketches as a child			2
after finishing school she applied to @entity99 , however @entity7 ended up turning down her place			2
what makes @entity7 's face painting technique so unusual , is that unlike other special effects make up artists , she does not rely on any prosthetic materials to create her ' faces ' she explains : ' i felt at the time that there was n’t anywhere for me to go with what i wanted to do , i did n’t want to be a standard artist			1
i loved special effects , particularly body and face art. ' i went to find out about it but there was literally nowhere in @entity91 or @entity117 that specialised in that kind up of make up art. ' feeling frustrated she decided to move to @entity1			0
within three weeks she met her husband and together they have opened a line of cafe ’s in the city			0
focusing on business and having two young children , @entity7 was n’t left with much time to focus on her art. when she turned 33 , she decided that it was time she invested in her talents			1
she enrolled in @entity131 ’s make up academy , which is based in @entity132			0
@entity7 , who lives with husband @entity45 and children @entity46 , 12 , and @entity48 , 10 , has been invited to teach at a prestigious make - up event in @entity50 in 2015 each transformation , like this one of @entity136 in @entity137 , takes up to four hours to create and requires tiny brushes to do the intricate lines it was n’t long before word of @entity7 ’s skills spread and she was working at the @entity143 on a play called @entity145			1
soon after , she began working on @entity146 ’s @entity149 production @entity147			0
' i had to do the make up for one of @entity153 ’s wives , @entity151			0
it was after she was beheaded so i had to make her look like she was dead , and as though she has been decapitated			0
' the budding make up artist had not really explored face painting at this stage , until she was approached by a mother at one of her children ’s school			0
she had heard that @entity7 was a make up artist and asked her to help out at the school ’s summer fete			1
' i was practicing on the children at home but they used to get bored so that ’s why i started painting my own face			0
' i would go up to the kitchen and start painting , it developed over the years , going from this level to the next and now people asking how did i learn to paint like this ? ' the famous faces are my favourite because they ’ve made me very popular they went viral on @entity80 which was a shock			1
people were messaging me from around the world , it was mad			0
' then the make up world and face painting world started talking to me , and people in @entity50 called the @entity185 and @entity186 , ' says @entity7			1
@entity7 says that although she would love to work behind the scenes in @entity189 productions , she will wait a few years as she is very dedicated to being close to her children as they grow up the association got in touch with @entity7 at the end of last summer , after seeing her famous faces creations on @entity80 and invited her to this year ’s event			1
@entity7 and her husband @entity45 flew for over a week			2
so that really spurred me on thinking i am doing something different , because to me i just thought i was clowning around			0
@entity38 and @entity200 went viral and then i decided to do more and more famous faces			2
they take me about four hours to do as they are very detailed , and i literally use the smallest brush - an eyeliner brush , ' says @entity7			2
the @entity206 was held in may this year and the organisation asked her to be a special guest and teach some classes at the event in 2015			1
@entity7 , here transforming herself into @entity211 , hopes to arrange to teach classes in the @entity213 and @entity214 , and prepare for her classes at the @entity206 and @entity216 in @entity50 next year she is currently sponsored by superstar face paints who are based in @entity214 and @entity219 @entity213			1
they provide her with the paints she needs and both have asked her to teach classes to their students			1
@entity7 decided to wait until she had visited @entity50 and watched how others teach , before leading her own classes			1
@entity7 says : ' it ’s a different ballgame and i want to do it the right way			2
superstar said just be yourself , and i did see that in @entity50			0
everybody was very relaxed and doing demos and asking questions			0
' ' my aim right now is to teach there next year in 2015			0
but i might start this year at some workshops in @entity214 and the @entity213			0
i just have to fit it in with the children			0
' @entity7 says that although she would love to work behind the scenes in @entity189 productions , she will wait a few years before applying for those roles as she is very dedicated to being close to her children as they grow up			1
@entity7 's skill have led to work for the @entity143 on a play called @entity145 and the @entity146 's @entity149 production @entity147 ( left : @entity250 skull look , right : @entity38 ) ' i do n’t feel comfortable about leaving them for months - which is how long it would be if i was working on a film			1
' i would also love to work in @entity10 or @entity1 , which is why i tried the @entity255 shows			2
i thought i could do something while i ’m still near home			0
' the talented artist is extremely excited to present her work at the @entity85 ( @entity86 ) in @entity1 this june			0
@entity86 is renowned for inviting the best make up artists in the world			0
' it ’s a huge compliment ; they even said they will put my superstar paints out while they develop theirs			0
so they asked if i can bring some of my own - that ’s in a few weeks time			0
' however most of the fx make up artists they work with mainly use prosthetics to create their looks , in contrast to @entity7 who only relies on face paints			1
it is not just faces that @entity7 is skilled at creating , with creatures , mystical beasts and even animals like this cat being within her artistic range ' i wanted to see how far i could get being an illusionist without using prosthetics , so i got a kick when i went to do face painting and someone asked if the nose was glued on			1
' and i could say no it ’s all paint , and then people asked for tutorial so then i started doing those			2
that made it even more popular because people could see that i was just drawing it on , ” adds the artist			0
after @entity86 , @entity7 hopes to arrange to teach classes in the @entity213 and @entity214 , and prepare for her classes at the @entity298 in @entity50 next year			1
@entity7 is currently sponsored by @entity300 shop and superstar face paints			2
she says they have both been extremely supportive of her work and of all their artists			0
she explains that @entity300 shop introduced her to the world of body painting and helped her put her video tutorials on @entity310			0
the make up artist explains : ' what i would like to do at the moment is teach , i think that would make me happy			0
' i thought about one day working as a teacher in a make up academy , but when you are freelance you get to do a lot of different things , which suits me because i bore easily			0
' if i became better known then i would love to give back more to @entity1 , but i would n’t say no to anything			2
