police were today hunting two eight year - old muggers who ripped an 80 - year - old woman 's bag from her hand just after she got off a bus on this road in the @entity10 area of @entity11 both were wearing hooded tops with the hoods worn up and ran off down a nearby street with her handbag , which contained her purse , keys , bank cards and a @entity27 mobile phone			1
' she felt someone pull at her handbag , ' a police spokesman said			2
' she let go and turned around to see two boys running off with her handbag			1
' neighbours living near to where the woman was attacked said a similar incident happened around 18 months ago when teenagers mugged a pensioner in the same area			1
@entity40 , 59 , said : ' this is absolutely despicable and a cowardly act			2
there have been anti-social behaviour problems in the past before but that 's not involved children , it 's been teenagers			1
' i find it disgusting that people at that age can do this			2
it 's always bad enough when people are mugged , but being eight or nine is unbelievable			2
' at that age what are they going to achieve by doing this ? it 's not like they are on drugs			2
' under the law , children under ten can not be charged with committing a criminal offence , but they can be given a curfew , or subjected to a child safety order ( file photo ) pensioner @entity67 , 73 , said he felt sorry for the elderly victim			1
' it 's hard to take in , ' he said			2
' being that age and to do something like that is awful			0
it 's very surprising and terrible			0
' it 's a nice area here and people do look out for each other and keep tabs on what is happening			1
' i ca n't believe they are walking around unsupervised at their age , that 's also what worries me			0
' lorry driver @entity86 , 47 , added : ' it 's normally quiet here 99 per cent of the time			0
at that age it is n't right , it 's terrible			0
' they should be doing normal things that normal children do at that age			1
i would love to see them caught as soon as possible and held to justice			0
you always get the odd incident but not when they are this age			0
' under the law , children under ten can not be charged with committing a criminal offence			1
however , they can be given a local child curfew , banning them from being in a public place between 6pm and 6am - unless with an adult , or a child safety order where they are placed under the supervision of a youth offending team			1
under tens who break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care , or their parents could be held responsible			0
people also took to social media to express their disbelief at the crime			0
@entity120 said : ' it 's disgusting			0
maybe if parents were allowed to chastise their kids , this kind of thing would n't happen so often			0
' @entity126 would n't because they 've been brought up properly			0
i hope the lady is all right and not too traumatised			0
' @entity129 said : ' obviously the parents have failed in their mission to educate their children			1
further inquiries need to be made			0
those children need attention and care			2
