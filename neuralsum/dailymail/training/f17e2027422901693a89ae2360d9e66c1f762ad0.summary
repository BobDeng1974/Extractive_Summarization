the @entity0 quickly denied claims on friday from a watchdog group that the @entity3 has militants stationed in @entity5 , @entity6 who plan an ' imminent ' attack against the @entity9			1
a @entity0 spokesman was bewildered , telling @entity11 that ' we are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim ' made by @entity15 , a center - right group			1
' in @entity6 ? ' the official said on the phone			2
' i have n't seen that at all			0
' an hour before @entity15 's report surfaced , homeland security secretary @entity20 said publicly that his agency and the @entity23 ' are unaware of any specific , credible threat to the @entity9 homeland ' from the terror network			1
and during a late - morning media briefing , @entity28 press secretary @entity27 said flatly that ' the most detailed intelligence assessment that i can offer from here is that there is no evidence or indication right now that [ @entity3 ] is actively plotting to attack the @entity9 homeland			1
that ’s true right now			0
' ' it 's a non-denial denial , ' he told @entity11			0
citing @entity20 's use of words like ' credible ' and ' specific , ' @entity38 said , ' you could drive a truck bomb through that loophole			1
@entity0 has not denied our story			2
' @entity15 reported friday , based on sources that it would not identify to @entity11 out of concern for their safety , that @entity3 terrorists are ' planning to attack the @entity9 with car bombs or other vehicle born [ sic ] improvised explosive devices			1
' the group said a ' warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack ' had been issued to ' agents across a number of @entity0 , @entity78 and defense agencies , ' instructing them ' to aggressively work all possible leads and sources ' to prevent it			1
it also claimed the commander of @entity85 , a @entity86 base near the @entity5 border crossing , has been briefed on the threat			2
' this is dire , ' @entity38 said			0
' look , this needs to be – it 's impossible for me to overstate the seriousness of the threat			0
' ' the president calls @entity3 a @entity97 terror organization , and now we have a report they 're in @entity5 , planning attacks with @entity101			1
' @entity38 predicted that the federal government may be playing a stalling game , with the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks approaching in less than two weeks			0
' this may be a case of them saying two weeks from now that they took care of the threat the @entity15 was saying [ was there ] , ' he said			2
later in the afternoon the @entity114 and @entity115 both published stories about a situation report distributed to law enforcement agencies by the @entity119			0
@entity114 did n't respond to questions about whether the documents were the same , but a @entity123 reporter said they were			0
@entity38 said @entity15 did not base its reporting on the same bulletin they cited			2
map : the @entity0 quickly denied claims on friday from a watchdog group that the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) has militants stationed in @entity5 , @entity6 @entity3 , a fearsome and deadly terror group that dominates much of @entity132 and @entity133 , now includes some militants with passports from the @entity9 and other @entity137 nations , a fact that worries @entity9 intelligence agencies nope : @entity28 press secretary @entity27 said @entity9 intelligence services have ' no evidence or indication right now that [ @entity3 ] is actively plotting to attack the @entity9 homeland ' ' the @entity145 bulletin is not inconsistent with our information , ' he said , but ' our story highlights more specific and imminent warnings			1
' ' it would not surprise us if it turns out the @entity145 bulletin is a watered - down - for - public - consumption - version of what our sources report			0
' @entity114 described a ' three - page bulletin , entitled " @entity156 on the @entity157 "			0
' ' social media account holders believed to be @entity3 militants and propagandists have called for unspecified border operations , ' the bulletin read , according to @entity114 , ' or they have sought to raise awareness that illegal entry through @entity6 is a viable option			1
' @entity123 had published its own report two hours earlier , reproducing a portion of one page			0
that page showed a recent video stunt in which conservative filmmaker @entity172 demonstrated the ease with which a terrorist could cross the @entity175 by donning an @entity177 mask and wading from @entity6 into @entity145			1
neither news outlet claimed the law enforcement bulletin articulated any warnings about an imminent terror attack			1
@entity5 : the crime - ridden @entity6 border town opposite @entity184 , @entity145 has become a staging ground for illegal immigrants – including drug cartel members and narcotics smugglers – to enter the @entity9 illegally @entity15 claimed the commander of @entity85 , an @entity86 base in @entity145 , has been briefed on but @entity38 stuck to his guns , insisting that the threat of an @entity3 incursion into @entity145 – @entity5 abuts @entity184 with just the @entity175 in between – is real			1
' we take it seriously , ' he said			0
' we did n't put it out there lightly			0
' in a nod to his organization 's frequent alarms about border security in @entity9 's southwest , he suggested that if the @entity205 administration was waving reporters away from the story , it was in order to draw attention away from illegal immigration concerns			2
' i ca n't say who in @entity212 knows about this , ' @entity38 said			0
' but to be sure , this is exactly the type of information that this administration would have an interest in minimizing , downplaying and withholding , to distract from the disaster on the border and the national security threat there			2
' @entity27 , president @entity205 's chief spokesman , told reporters on friday that @entity9 's border crisis is over ' for now			1

three **online** reports warned friday of @entity3 involvement south of the border , including one from @entity15 that cited ' imminent ' car - bomb attacks
the @entity0 and the @entity28 quickly denied that they have any information about @entity3 gathering an attack force in @entity6
@entity0 secretary @entity20 said @entity9 is ' unaware of any specific , credible threat to the @entity9 homeland ' from the terror network
other reports cited social media warnings from @entity3 militants and an **online** video showing a conservative filmmaker in a @entity177 mask *sneaking* into the @entity9 from @entity6
