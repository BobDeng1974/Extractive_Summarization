women taking @entity1 could cut their risk of heart disease and an early death – as long as they start in their 50s , according to researchers			1
data from 40,000 patients found that those taking the drugs from this age were less likely to die prematurely from any cause and the threat of a heart attack was halved			1
there was , however , a slightly raised risk of blood clots			1
an estimated one million women in @entity19 take hormone replacement therapy to control symptoms of the menopause and experts believe taking it in your 50s could help cut the risk of early death and heart attacks @entity1 is given to control symptoms of the menopause and is usually taken by women in their early 50s			1
this large - scale review sought to investigate if it has positive or negative effects on other areas of women ’s health			0
when evidence from those across a wider age range was examined , it showed oral @entity1 did not protect against heart disease and may increase stroke risk			1
but the beneficial effects became apparent in a group of 9,000 women who started @entity1 at or not long after the menopause and before 60			2
they took it for three to ten years			0
lead researcher dr @entity48 , from @entity49 , said : ‘ the evidence we have provides some support for the so - called “ timing hypothesis ” but we should bear in mind the size of this effect			0
‘ when we looked at the results according to the age of women , or by how long since their menopause that they started treatment , we found that if 1,000 women under 60 started therapy we would expect six fewer deaths , eight fewer cases of heart disease and five extra blood clots over about seven years , compared to a 1,000 similar women who did not start			1
’ an estimated one million women in the @entity19 take @entity1 for symptoms like hot flushes and mood changes although it also protects bones			1
however , some specialists have long held that @entity1 should prevent heart disease based on the fact that when women naturally lose supplies of oestrogen at the menopause , their heart risks rise			1
@entity1 is given to control symptoms of the menopause and the study collected data from 40,000 patients across the @entity19 ( file picture , posed ) the theory was that taking oestrogen supplements – the basis of @entity1 – would help restore protection			1
but startling results from the @entity97 women ’s health initiative study in 2002 not only found no heart disease benefits but harm caused by breast cancer			2
however , expert analysis has since concluded that the risks were largely found in women taking @entity1 many years past the menopause in their 60s and 70s for whom it was never intended			2
the latest findings , published in the @entity110 international database , came to a similar conclusion			0
in women under 60 or who started @entity1 within ten years of the menopause , there was a 30 per cent drop in deaths from any cause and a 48 per cent lower risk of coronary heart disease			1
as well as a small increased risk of blood clots , there was a suggestion of a higher chance of stroke			2
however , this was inconclusive			0
the general findings across different age groups showed death rates from any cause , specifically cardiovascular disease , were not affected by being on @entity1			0
but there was a 24 per cent higher risk of stroke			0
dr @entity48 said : ‘ the evidence adds to a large bank of evidence that helps gps advise their patients			0
but you need to weigh up the severity of the symptoms and the benefits and harms			0
’ dr @entity147 , editor - in - chief of the @entity110 , said : ‘ the main analysis that the authors did found no benefit and so we need to apply caution to the results from the sub-group analysis			0
‘ however if true , this apparent benefit in preventing heart disease in younger women should be considered alongside other possible benefits and emerging evidence of harms , including the risk of breast cancer , ovarian cancer and @entity164			2
’ the review looked at almost 4,000 investigations worldwide , including two large @entity97 studies which recruited women as old as 79 .			0
