while most artists would be distraught at their work being vandalised , one sculptor believes the erosion of his underwater pieces by marine life has only made them better			1
more than 450 figurative sculptures have been installed in the underwater museum , the @entity8 , since @entity10 sculptor @entity9 co-founded it back in 2009 off the coast of @entity13 , @entity14			1
but many of the artworks , all part of ' the @entity17 ' project ' , are unrecognisable today after coral , sea urchins and other marine life have taken them over as their new home			1
transformation : @entity9 's sculpture of @entity30 , the owner of a @entity27 showroom in @entity28 , has been taken over by marine life in the @entity32 in @entity13 , @entity14 underwater artwork : a sculpture based on a local school teacher called @entity36 , pictured left , is now encrusted with coral and covered in sea urchins			1
pictured right is another piece from ' the @entity17 ' project which has been transformed by sea - life over the years new home : this work by @entity9 is based on @entity44 , a local fisherman from @entity46			1
it is located 10 metres below the sea surface in the @entity32 in @entity13 , @entity14 , and is now home to a vast array of sea - life the 39 - year - old said : ' when i place them underwater it is the beginning of their lifecycle			1
for me they only come alive when they have their underwater patina			0
' they are made from inert cement but when you see the skin of capillaries and tubular networks of the marine life and sponges colonising them , it makes them feel immortal			1
' the sculptures are all based on real - life people including @entity30 , the owner of a @entity27 showroom in @entity28 ; @entity71 , a fisherman from @entity46 , @entity14 ; and @entity36 , a local school teacher			1
over time the works have become encrusted with hundreds of luridly - coloured sea sponges , spiny sea urchins and marine plants called hydroids , capable of delivering a nasty sting when touched			1
coming to life : @entity9 believes the sculptures only come alive when they are covered in marine life life below the surface : ' the @entity83 ' , a sculpture by @entity9 , sits in a bed of sea grass the spiny sea urchins crawl across the faces of the sculptures , 10 metres below the surface , and provide a useful service to @entity9 by eating the algae that can prevent coral from forming			1
asked if he has any plans to prune back the growth on his works to ensure they do not become obscured , the artist is resolute			0
' no , the plan is leave them as they are , ' @entity9 said			2
' the human figure is so embedded in our psyche that even a small reference to our anatomy helps us comprehend the artwork			0
' despite their foreboding appearance of the sculptures , @entity9 says that to him they feel ' almost feel like family ' , although he admits that visitors to the museum are occasionally spooked			1
' some times people get a little scared , it depends on the conditions of the day , ' @entity9 said			2
' if the water is clear with bright sun the figures have a slightly euphoric feel , other days when it is cloudy or the water murky the encounter can be quite startling			0
' each character has a unique story and it is very exciting for me watching nature take over			0
' under the sea : @entity9 's underwater sculpture ' @entity133 ' at the @entity134 @entity135			1
over time bright yellow fire coral will travel along the stainless steel lattice and look like blood through veins living art : an underwater sculpture by artist @entity9 , entitled ' resurrection '			1
the work uses live purple @entity144 ( @entity146 ) , which had been displaced from the reef system in a storm man on fire : the artist 's sculpture ' @entity151 ' , is made from black @entity154 neutral marine cement , and depicts a solitary burning figure			2
over time it will be overrun with fast - growing , bright yellow live fire coral the artist is happy to abandon his works to the waves , but does acknowledge that there can be downsides to working in an underwater environment			2
he said : ' sometimes when diving at night my dive lights attract thousands of tiny swimming sea worms			0
recently one crawled inside my ear canal and felt like it had entered my brain			0
' i was on my own at the time and found it quite disturbing , although fortunately after 20 minutes it found its way out ! ' @entity175 has previously created a real life city of @entity177 , sunk a life - size sculpture of a @entity179 and even a house			0
he also unveiled a series of new sculptures last month including one called @entity183 , a cement cast of a hunched - over woman , which alludes to the loss of @entity188 coral reefs , while another , @entity151 , depicts a solitary burning figure - a reference to the practice of setting yourself on fire as a form of political protest			0
talking art : ' the speaker ' stands in a bed of sea grass			0
the sculpture is planted with more than 200 cuttings of rare @entity204 coral stunning : the sculpture is planted with more than 200 cuttings of the rare @entity204 coral , in @entity13 , @entity14 prolific : @entity175 now has 510 sculptural works permanently on display at the site , many of which feature live coral latest additions : the 39 - year - old unveiled a new series of works last month in the @entity8 , the subaquatic museum he co-founded back in 2009 off the coast of @entity13 , @entity14 made from black @entity154 neutral marine cement , the work is augmented with stainless steel spines , and over time it will be overrun with fast - growing , bright yellow live fire coral which will mimic flames			1
@entity175 said : ' i try to use the work to highlight the huge losses we 're having and how our blue planet is changing quite dramatically			0
' future generations are n't going to see the same number of species and fantastic pristine reefs			0
' but i want to balance that sadness - in order to inspire people , you have to offer them hope as well			0
' another of @entity9 's sculptures is @entity238 , a winged angelic - looking figure , which uses live purple @entity241 fan coral and had to be rescued after being displaced from the reef system and damaged during a recent storm			2
art with a message : a number of the new works deal with the devastation of the natural marine habitat natural subject : ' @entity183 ' in the @entity8 in @entity13 , @entity14 , a cement cast of a hunched - over woman , alludes to the tragic loss of @entity188 coral reefs artistic installation : one of the artist 's latest sculptures is pictured being lowered down into the water at the submarine park last light : the sculpture gets one last glimpse of daylight before being completely submerged by the water getting wet : no turning back is carefully winched into the water and placed on a rock at the bottom of the ocean strong currents around the museum meant that the sculptures had to be craned from a bridge into a nearby canal and then toed out to the site			1
the @entity274 , @entity275 , born artist said : ' some of these were much more delicate than pieces i 've made before , so it was difficult working in tough conditions			0
' i had to box some of them up in crates and then sink them underwater in their crates			0
believe me , taking a crate apart underwater is difficult			0
' @entity175 now has 510 sculptural works permanently on display at the site , although these are his final additions for the time being as he prepares to relocate back to @entity292			0
however , the museum has been a huge success , receiving 250,000 visitors each year , and @entity9 is trying to secure funding to eventually expand it to include 8,000 figures - more than the famous @entity298			2
he said : ' i 'm leaving @entity14 , but i 've got this legacy here , that my daughter can come back in twenty years time and it will still be there			2
' some of his more creative works include a life - size version of a @entity179 and an underwater ' city ' of homes			2
hands on : @entity133 sticks out of the top of the water as it is lowered down by a crane hook , left , while artist @entity9 gets into the water himself to help lower one of his sculptures into place , right preparation work : @entity9 works on his sculpture ' @entity151 ' in his studio in @entity13 expanding : the museum has been a huge success , receiving 250,000 visitors each year , and @entity9 is trying to secure funding to eventually expand the site to 8,000 figures			1

@entity10 sculptor @entity9 co-founded the @entity325 in @entity13 , @entity14 , in 2009
over the years he has installed more than 450 works of art in the underwater museum
some sculptures are *barely* recognisable after coral , sea urchins and other marine life have made them their homes
