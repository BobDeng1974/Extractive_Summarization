while @entity1 did not order the programme , @entity0 says he was ' aware ' of it president @entity5 secretly endorsed the release of hardened criminals to assassinate @entity9 leader @entity8 to curb the @entity11 threat , a new book has claimed			1
at the height of tensions between @entity14 and neighbouring communist @entity9 in the early 1960s , @entity1 was implicit in the freeing of rapists , drug dealers , and mafia hitmen through @entity20 in a bid to recruit ' untraceable ' spies willing to risk their lives on dangerous missions rather than go back to jail , a new book sensationally claims			1
desperate to remove @entity8 from power , the president resorted to using dangerous criminals as operatives - rather than @entity20 agents - to ' do @entity14 's dirty work ' as they could n't be linked back to his administration , it is claimed			1
in one failed plot , an ex con was smuggled into @entity9 in 1962 to pose as a waiter in @entity8 's favourite restaurant where he would drop poison tablets into the revolutionary leader 's soup			0
height of the @entity42 : desperate to remove @entity8 , right , from power , president @entity5 , left , resorted to using dangerous criminals as operatives - rather than @entity20 agents - to ' do @entity14 's dirty work ' the explosive claims come in a new book by veteran @entity14 journalist and author @entity0 , who claims specially - recruited criminals became ' untouchable ' and were allowed to embark on ' crime sprees ' in the @entity14 without fear of prosecution			1
@entity0 , former assignment editor at @entity14 news networks @entity53 and @entity54 , says he uncovered the programme - which he believes is still in operation today - after following the ' trail of destruction ' left by one such operative			1
though @entity1 did not order the setting up of the top secret programme , @entity0 says that as president @entity5 would have ' been aware ' of it			1
' for over 50 years , the @entity20 and @entity14 government has been systematically releasing dangerous criminals back into society to work for them on secret missions overseas , ' said @entity0 , whose new book @entity66 details the life of alleged @entity20 operative and ' one - man @entity14 crime wave ' @entity71			1
' the programme started during the @entity5 administration at the start of the 1960s as a clandestine means of dealing with the @entity11 threat of @entity8 , and was given the seal of approval by @entity1 - who was still smarting following the political embarrassment of the failed @entity82 in 1961			2
' one man @entity14 crime wave ' : the details of the plot were revealed by veteran journalist and author @entity0 , whose new book @entity66 , right , details the life of alleged @entity20 operative and ' one - man @entity14 crime wave ' @entity71 ' criminals were ideal operatives as they were ruthless and willing to risk their lives during missions rather than be sent back to prison			1
they also could n't be officially connected with the @entity20 so it did n't matter if they were captured - there was no risk of @entity14 's shady policies being exposed			2
' @entity71 was a typical recruit			1
highly intelligent , ambitious and with no morals			0
the @entity20 sent him on many missions abroad , including to @entity9 to assassinate @entity8 , ' added @entity0			2
' between missions he was allowed to do what he liked - which generally consisted of embezzlement , fraud , gunrunning and drug dealing - without fear of being arrested or prosecuted			0
' warning : @entity0 claims the @entity20 continues to recruit hardened criminals to ' do @entity14 's dirty work ' with impunity @entity0 claims to have first encountered @entity71 back in 1961 while working as a dj at a radio station in @entity111 , @entity112			1
@entity71 , then in his early 20s and with ambitions of being the ' next @entity114 ' , had connections with the @entity116 and used his connections to ' persuade ' the radio station to play his records			0
though they lost touch , @entity0 next heard of @entity71 in april 1962 when working as a cub reporter for a @entity111 tv station - after hearing he had hijacked a plane to @entity9			1
according to news reports , on friday , april 13 , 1962 , @entity71 and an accomplice had forced pilot @entity126 at gunpoint to fly them to the communist island , where they planned to defect , only for the @entity9 authorities to imprison them before sending them back to @entity111			0
@entity0 says he was contacted by @entity71 prior to the @entity134 trial and during that meeting revealed that he was working for the @entity20 and had been sent to infiltrate @entity9 as a spy			1
' the skyjacking was just a smokescreen conjured up by the @entity20 after the mission went wrong			0
' @entity71 confessed that he 'd been recruited by the intelligence agency while in prison for extortion of a public official back in 1960 , and had been sent to @entity9 to carry out a number of assignments - including one to assassinate @entity8			0
' he had posed as a waiter at one of @entity8 's favourite restaurants and been supplied with @entity150 tablets - an untraceable poison - by the @entity20 to drop into his soup , but @entity8 must have got wind of the plan as he suddenly stopped eating there			0
' @entity0 admits that at first he thought that @entity71 was a ' fantasist ' and , after the criminal was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the skyjacking by the @entity14 @entity159 in november 1964 , largely forgot about him			2
@entity1 with military leaders in 1962 : the programme started during the @entity5 administration at the start of the 1960s as a clandestine means of dealing with the @entity11 threat of @entity8			0
but @entity0 claims the practice is still in use today it was only after his retirement from @entity54 in 2005 , when he started writing @entity66 , that @entity0 discovered that @entity71 might have been telling the truth about the criminal operatives programme all along			1
@entity0 traced @entity71 's whereabouts from the time of the skyjacking trial onwards and found that far from serving his time in jail , he had apparently been back on the streets committing crimes within a matter of months			2
the journalist uncovered over 40 newspaper reports of @entity71 's various crimes in archives and gained further corroboration of his seeming invulnerability to prosecution after tracking down several of his victims			0
he added : ' @entity71 was a one - man crime wave who was allowed by the @entity20 , and indirectly the president , to consistently get away with his crimes in return for his occasional assistance			1
' in the late 1960s and early ' 70s he went on undercover missions to @entity196 , @entity197 and other troubled @entity199 countries , and back at home got away with embezzlement , fraud , gunrunning , drug dealing and sexual assault among other crimes			0
smoking gun : @entity0 says @entity71 had posed as a waiter at one of @entity8 's ( pictured ) favourite restaurants and been supplied with @entity150 tablets - an untraceable poison - by the @entity20 to drop into his soup , but @entity8 must have got wind of the plan as he suddenly stopped eating there ' he has left a string of victims across the @entity14 over the last 40 years , but the police and @entity219 have been powerless to act because he is protected by the @entity20			1
the agency maintains a policy of complete secrecy and does n't want to risk compromising operations by having one of their operatives involved in a public trial			0
' one unfortunate woman who came across @entity71 was swindled out of $ 20,000 - her life savings - and the deeds to several properties , but the police and @entity233 were n't allowed to warn her , and were n't allowed to stop him			2
' @entity0 says that he has evidence of @entity71 living in @entity235 in 2005 , but after that the scene goes cold			2
he claims requests for information from the @entity219 , @entity20 , @entity239 and other government agencies were ignored and suspects @entity71 , now in his 70s , is either dead or has been placed into a @entity243 scheme to put him out of reach			2
@entity0 says he does n't disapprove of @entity14 's criminal operatives programme per se , but has written @entity66 to warn the @entity14 public about the programme in case they become victims of ' untouchables ' such as @entity71			1
he added : ' @entity14 has lots of enemies and security has to be maintained if we are to prevent another 9/11 so i am not against a programme that helps protect the nation			0
' what i do object to is the @entity20 's insistence on complete secrecy			0
the rationale that a few @entity14 have to suffer for the sake of 315 million is not acceptable			0
' it 's sad and pathetic that totally innocent @entity14 have lost virtually everything , including their homes and businesses , while the @entity233 stood by and did nothing but protect their released criminals			0
' the @entity20 should be capable of controlling freed criminals without exposing their clandestine operations , and if they ca n't , should discretely warn potential victims to keep away from these people			0
