by @entity0 the packing checklist for a girls ’ break abroad can – most women would surely admit – be a lengthy one , with the shoes section alone capable of taking up several pages			0
but if there is one thing a female traveller does not need to take with her on holiday , then – according to new research – it ’s a man			0
holiday heaven for one : two thirds of @entity17 women feel more confident taking a holiday by themselves a poll of over 2000 @entity17 holidaymakers has revealed a growing trend for women to take trips abroad by themselves – with many saying they enjoy the experience far more than when they are accompanied by a husband , a boyfriend or a male companion			1
the survey , which was conducted by accommodation website @entity31 , revealed that 54 per cent of @entity17 women say they are more likely to take a foreign escape by themselves than they were five years ago – while almost two thirds ( 64 per cent ) say that they feel more confident when taking a trip on their own than with a man			1
travelling alone also seems to be beneficial to the holiday itself , with 61 per cent of women surveyed saying they feel more energised when taking a holiday by themselves – and more refreshed for the experience when they return home			2
reasons given for these boys - not - invited breaks include a greater sense of freedom , and the chance to travel without having to cater to other people			0
just short of two thirds of the women who responded to the survey said a break for one means they have the opportunity to be themselves while away			2
staying in touch : 62 per cent of female travellers keep in contact by using social media while on their travels and almost half – 47 per cent – said that a solo holiday is heaven because they can be selfish and do exactly what they like – without having to worry about a partner who wants to see different sights or do something else during a long day in the sun. ‘ our research suggests that the phenomenon of the female solo traveller is one that is here to stay , ’ says @entity74 of @entity31			1
‘ a third of @entity17 female travellers are looking for that freedom to set their own agenda , and to find that boost in confidence that a solo break provides			1
’ the survey also showed that social media is the key way of communicating for the modern female traveller			0
again , almost two thirds of respondees – 62 per cent – said that they keep in touch with friends and relatives at home by using the likes of @entity99 and @entity100			0
and three quarters – 75 per cent – said that social media gives them the confidence to travel alone , enabling them to plan a route in advance , or unearth places to eat and stay			0
which way from here ? 64 per cent of women surveyed said a holiday by themselves gives them more freedom the poll was conducted from a sample of @entity17 men and women , aged between 25 and 45 , who have travelled away from the @entity17 since april 2013			1
and half of the women surveyed enjoyed their holiday me - time so much that they tend to do it all over again – 51 per cent say they plan to travel solo again in the next 12 months .			2
