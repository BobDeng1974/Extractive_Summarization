by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 17:41 est , 6 april 2013 foreign secretary @entity1 has urged @entity2 not to execute drug smuggling grandmother @entity3 foreign secretary @entity1 has urged a court in @entity2 not to execute a @entity6 grandmother convicted of drug smuggling			1
a panel of judges in @entity10 is expected to rule this month on an appeal against the death penalty passed in january on @entity3 from @entity13			1
drugs mule @entity3 , 56 , was caught smuggling cocaine worth £ 1.6 million in the lining of a suitcase from @entity18 to the island last year			1
she got a death sentence despite taking part in a sting after her arrest which resulted in the arrest and conviction of the smuggling plot ’s alleged masterminds , who got lighter sentences			0
now , in a forceful intervention , mr @entity1 has sent a strongly - worded appeal to the three judges through the @entity32 arguing @entity3 ’s death penalty is ' unwarranted because it is an excessive punishment '			1
the 14 - page submission , shown to the @entity35 by a court insider , says the @entity6 government has ' serious concerns ' over @entity3 ’s case			1
' the government requests that the court takes into account the violations of mrs @entity3 ’s fundamental rights and decide that in these circumstances the death penalty would not be appropriate , ' it says			1
' allegations of mistreatment of mrs @entity3 during the initial period in detention have been raised			0
this includes threats with a gun and sleep deprivation			0
' the @entity6 government also has serious concerns at the absence of immediate – and prolonged delay of – consular notification			0
this is all the more concerning given the absence of legal representation and a translator during the period of detention			0
' the document – known as an @entity68 – says @entity3 ’s death penalty should be reduced to a jail term and implies her execution would have diplomatic repercussions			2
' mrs @entity3 is a 56 year old woman			2
she has two sons and an infant grandchild who would plainly be seriously affected were mrs @entity3 to be executed , ' it says			0
@entity3 was caught smuggling cocaine worth £ 1.6million in her suitcase from @entity78 ' mrs @entity3 cooperated with the authorities with a view to detaining others who were involved in the drug trafficking			1
' the @entity83 should take into account this cooperation , especially given that the others involved have now been convicted			0
' briton @entity3 , 43 , the plot ’s alleged mastermind , was sentenced to six years for possessing cocaine after initial accusations of conspiracy to traffic drugs were reduced			1
his partner @entity3 , 38 , got one year for failing to report a crime while a third @entity3 , 40 - year - old @entity3 , jailed for four years for possessing drugs			2
@entity3 claims she only agreed to carry the cocaine because of death threats to her son and says @entity3 , @entity97 and @entity3 organised her smuggling run from @entity18 to @entity10			1
@entity6 embassy officials in @entity2 did not learn of @entity3 ’s arrest for nearly two weeks after her initial arrest as she cooperated in the drawn - out police sting			2
' the ( @entity6 ) government wishes to draw the attention of the court to the allegations of mistreatment by officials when mrs @entity3 was first detained , ' says the document			0
@entity3 , left , was convicted of drug - smuggling along with briton @entity3 , right , the plot 's alleged mastermind who was jailed for six years ' this mistreatment constituted violations of mrs @entity3 ’s fundamental rights under international law and @entity2 constitutional law			1
' mrs @entity3 was also not provided with a lawyer during the period of interrogation and in addition concerns have been raised about the adequacy of mrs @entity3 ’s legal representation during parts of the trial process			0
' criticising the january sentence in the district court in the island capital @entity128 , document argues : ' it is not apparent that the court took account of these considerable mitigating factors when making its decision			0
' the fact that the prosecution did not seek the death penalty gives weight to the inappropriateness of the death sentence in ms @entity3 ’s case			2
' @entity3 will be executed by firing squad if her death penalty is upheld			2
she can , however , make a further appeal to @entity2 ’s @entity144 in @entity145			0

he added : ' the amicus brief forms part of @entity3 ’s appeal against her death penalty sentence			1
