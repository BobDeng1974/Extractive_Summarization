3d printing has already begun blurring the lines between amateur designers and professional engineers			1
but now the fashion world is hoping to get a slice of the action			0
@entity8 - based designer @entity7 has used technology that was once the preserve of large engineering industries to create striking bespoke fashion accessories			1
@entity12 uses 3d printing and white nylon to create designs such a scaffolded corset , a blossoming feathered shoulder piece and a waist bracelet her collection , @entity12 , is designed to ‘ push the boundaries of digital fabrication within the luxury market			1
’ it uses @entity24 printed white nylon to create designs such a scaffolded corset , a blossoming feathered shoulder piece and a waist bracelet			1
the collection is complemented by four transformative headpieces that hide key areas of the face ; including a guilded horn and a mirrored mask , and a cut out visor helmet			0
@entity8 - based designer @entity7 hopes that her collection will show how 3d printing can sustainably solve sizing issues and cut down on wastage while better supporting consumer demand inspired by identity and the visual structure of human chromosomes , @entity12 is created almost entirely with individual and interchangeable ball and socket components ‘ advances in technology have allowed me to utilise my expertise as a pattern cutter to approach current complications surrounding garment sizing and manufacturing restrictions , ’ said ms @entity45			1
‘ 3d technology can sustainably solve sizing issues and cut down on wastage while better supporting consumer demand			2
’ the collection is complemented by four transformative headpieces that hide key areas of the face ; including a guilded horn and a mirrored mask , and a cut out visor helmet ms @entity45 started her collection by scanning the body of the wearer and then importing the data into @entity69 software each piece is bespoke and can be designed to fit any body shape			2
once a computer model is produced , it is sent to a @entity75 3d printer which produces the designs from powdered nylon ms @entity45 started her collection by scanning the body of wearer and then importing the data into @entity69 software			2
the computer models were then sent to a @entity75 3d printer			0
the technology , also known as rapid prototyping , works by using software to divide these computer designs into triangular facet			0
this allows a 3d printer to read the designs and then deposits successive layers of material which can either be in liquid , powder or sheet form			0
the layers are jointed together automatically to create the final design , corresponding to the initial computer model			0
inspired by identity and the visual structure of human chromosomes , @entity12 is created almost entirely with individual and interchangeable ball and socket components @entity12 is currently taking part in the @entity107 's new exhibition , ' @entity104 is here : a @entity108			2
' the exhibition runs until 29 october @entity12 is currently taking part in the @entity107 ’s new exhibition , ‘ @entity110 ’			1
the exhibition runs until 29 october and will look at new methods of manufacturing and emerging digital technology and how these are revolutionising the role of the consumer , and the manufacturing process .			0
