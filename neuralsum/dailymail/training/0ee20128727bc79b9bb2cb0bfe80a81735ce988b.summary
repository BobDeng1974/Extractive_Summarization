two leading women 's charities have warned making it illegal for women to drink while they are pregnant could ' undermine their autonomy drinking during pregnancy could be classed as a criminal offence , in light of a landmark case due to be heard at the @entity9 tomorrow			1
a council in @entity11 is seeking criminal injuries compensation for a six - year - old girl with ' growth retardation ' , caused by her mother 's alcohol consumption during pregnancy			1
if the court agrees that the woman committed a crime , it could pave the way for a pregnant woman 's behaviour to be criminalised			1
however two women 's charities have warned that any such ruling could ' seriously undermine women 's autonomy while pregnant and their freedom to make decisions for themselves '			1
the case is of ' profound social significance ' and could establish a legal precedent which could be used to prosecute women who drink while pregnant			2
there are fears it could mean other aspects of women 's behaviour - such as medication taken during pregnancy or her choice of childbirth - could also have damning implications			1
charities also fear women with addictions could choose to abort their unborn children rather than face criminal prosecution			1
@entity50 , chief executive of bpas , and @entity53 , co-chair of @entity54 , said : ' making one particular form of behaviour during pregnancy into a criminal offence would lay the ground for criminalising a wide range of other behaviours because they may too pose a risk to the health of the baby			2
' similar developments in the @entity66 have resulted in women being imprisoned			0
as a result , the @entity68 for @entity69 in the country has urged caution over this @entity74 case			0
it has called on the court to ' reject efforts to create criminal penalties as a mechanism for addressing health problems women may face during pregnancy '			2
the syndrome was diagnosed 252 times in @entity93 between 2012 and 2013			0
but the charities claim that there is ' continuing uncertainty ' in the medical profession over the relationship between drinking and harm to the foetus			0
and they say mothers and their babies would not be best served by treating pregnant women with drug or alcohol abuse problems as criminals			2
the @entity9 will decide if the mother of a six - year - old girl born with foetal alcohol syndrome committed a crime in drinking alcohol while she was pregnant			1
the case could set a legal precedent , criminalising women 's behaviours while they are expecting lawyers representing the local authority are seeking to prove the six - year - old 's mother committed a crime under the @entity123 1861			1
the case will be heard at the @entity9 tomorrow			2
in january , it emerged they had failed in their bid to win compensation on the child 's behalf from the @entity131 ( @entity131 )			0
a written ruling by the @entity133 of the @entity134 said the child was born with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder as a ' direct result ' of her mother 's drinking			1
@entity86 ( @entity86 ) is a complex condition , denoting a collection of features including retarded growth , facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment			1
there remains uncertainty in the medical community over the relationship between alcohol consumption and harm to the foetus			0
while it occurs in babies born to alcoholic women , most babies of alcoholic women will not be affected , as other factors , including nutritional status , genetic make - up of mother and foetus , age and general health , are also thought to play a role			2
there were 252 diagnoses of @entity86 in @entity93 in 2012 to 2013			0
but it concluded : ' if ( the girl ) was not a person while her mother was engaging in the relevant actions then ... as a matter of law , her mother could not have committed a criminal offence			0
' neither the girl nor the mother was identified in the ruling			0
@entity182 and @entity183 said criminalising mothers is not the way to best help them or their children			0
instead , pregnant women with addiction problems need rapid access to specialist support services , as do children born with disability caused by drug or alcohol abuse			1
ms @entity50 and ms @entity53 said : ' viewing these cases as potential criminal offences will do nothing for the health of women and their babies			0
' there is a strong public interest in promoting the good health of pregnant women and babies , but , as long - standing government policy recognises , this interest is best served by treating addiction and substance abuse in pregnancy as a public health , not criminal , issue			2
' as well as undermining women 's ability to make their own choices while pregnant , women with substance addictions may avoid engaging with health services or feel compelled to terminate their pregnancy rather than continue and face criminal sanctions			1
' it could also make health professionals responsible for reporting women in their care to the police			0
' both the immediate and broader implications of this case are troubling			0

@entity9 will decide if girl born with growth retardation , caused by her mother 's drinking during pregnancy , should receive compensation
landmark case could pave the way for a pregnant woman 's behaviour to be criminalised , two leading women 's charities have warned
six - year - old was born with foetal alcohol syndrome - the *symptoms* include growth , facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment
