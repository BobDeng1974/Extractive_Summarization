by @entity0 fifty @entity2 producers are set to make two versions of the film so they can please both fans of the explicit book and allow the movie to be shown in mainstream cinemas			1
' what we ’re kind of hearing from the fans is they want it dirty ... they want it as close as possible [ to the book ] , ' said producer @entity14 , who has been listening to the demands of the book 's female followers on @entity18			1
after a fairly restrained take on the bondage bestseller for mainstream cinema audiences , he reveals filmmakers are planning to release a more explicit version soon afterwards			2
fifty shades producer @entity14 ( left ) and author @entity23 ( right ) the sex scenes featuring bondage , spanking and sadomasochism were a big part of the appeal of the so - called ' mommy porn ' books by @entity23			0
they tell the story of virginal college student @entity34 , who embarks on an intense voyage of sexual discovery with her s&m - loving boss , billionaire entrepreneur @entity34 but they have created a minefield for filmmakers of the £ 25m movie who risk either neglecting the racy book 's fans by toning it down too much or getting a rating that deems it off limits for mainstream cinemas			2
if the first version of the film gets an @entity55 or restricted rating in @entity57 it could be seen by anyone aged 17 or over			1
a more explicit version may get the much rarer nc - 17 certificate , which is reserved for films depicting rape or drug use			1
' i always thought it would be really cool if we released the r version [ 18 in @entity68 ] and then we had an nc - 17 version that we released a few weeks later			1
' everybody could go and enjoy the r version , and then if they really wanted to see it again and get a little bit more gritty with it then have that nc - 17 version out there as well			1
that is my idea , but the fans and the studio [ @entity81 ] will benefit from the double dip ... @entity83 plays @entity34 ( left ) and @entity85 - born former model @entity84 plays @entity2 ( right ) ' we do not want this film to be seen as mommy porn - we want to keep it elevated but also give the fans what they want , ' @entity14 told review site collider.com			1
if the clever marketing strategy was followed in @entity68 the film could seek an 18 certificate for the more vanilla version and an r18 rating for the explicit cut , meaning it could be shown only in cinemas with a special license cinemas , revealed the @entity102			2
but cinemas could legally change themselves into sex - film venues for ' special events ' such as midnight screenings , as long as they get local authority approval , said a former adviser to the @entity108			0
the film 's scheduled release was delayed after @entity68 actor @entity111 , 33 , pulled out of the lead role			0
he has been replaced by @entity85 - born former model @entity84 , 31 , who portrayed a serial killer in the @entity115 series @entity116			0
@entity83 , 24 , the daughter of @entity117 and @entity118 , plays the role of @entity34			0
the highly - anticipated movie , which starts shooting in @entity121 tomorrow , was scheduled to premiere in august next year			0
however fans will have to wait a little while longer			0
the first part of the trilogy is now set to hit the big screen until february 13 2015 , suggesting @entity81 hopes it will be a @entity127 's date movie .			0

producers hope first version gets r rating in @entity57 , seen by anyone 17 *+*
want to release more explicit one with rare @entity135 - 17 reserved for rape or drugs
' we *'re* hearing fans want it dirty ... as close as possible [ to the book ] '
