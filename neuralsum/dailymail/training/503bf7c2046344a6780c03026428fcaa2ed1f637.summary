@entity85 said such a compromise must guarantee the rights of the @entity58 - speaking residents of eastern @entity32 , who must feel like they are ' an integral part ' of their own country			1
@entity85 's statement appeared to signal that he sees their future in @entity32			1
separatists in the eastern @entity103 and @entity104 regions have declared independence and asked to join @entity58			0
@entity25 has rebuffed their appeals , but is seen by @entity32 and the @entity107 as actively supporting the insurgency			2

@entity123 has also accused @entity58 of moving troops back toward the @entity32 border			2
@entity85 appears determined to keep up the pressure to force the @entity1 government to give the eastern industrial regions more powers and to prevent @entity32 from moving too close to the @entity130 or @entity123			2
but he also wants to avoid more punishing sanctions from the @entity132 and particularly from the @entity130 , whose leaders will meet friday in @entity134 , and therefore needs to be seen as cooperating with efforts to de-escalate the conflict			0
the @entity137 initially dismissed the peace plan that new @entity32 president @entity139 laid out on friday			0
but in a statement issued late saturday , @entity85 said he welcomed the cease - fire and @entity139 's ' intention to take other concrete steps to reach a peaceful settlement			1

he also proposed new local and parliamentary elections , and measures to protect the language rights of @entity58 speakers in the east			0
@entity85 was more specific when he spoke publicly following ceremonies commemorating the @entity173 invasion of the @entity174 on june 22 , 1941			0
' that president @entity139 announced a truce is without a doubt an important part of a final settlement , without which no agreement can be reached , and there is no doubt that @entity58 will support this intention , but in the end the most important thing is a political process , ' @entity85 said			1

' after the @entity58 government too referred to the cease - fire in positive terms , the interlocutors emphasised the need for all sides to abide by it now and for a political dialogue to be put in motion , ' @entity196 's office said in a statement			1
' another topic of the conversation was the issue of securing the @entity32 - @entity58 border			2
' in @entity1 , @entity139 also addressed his nation on the day on which @entity32 and @entity58 mourn the millions who died during @entity218 he called for peace , but urged his compatriots to stand strong and united			0
' it was so during the violent struggle against the @entity223 and it should be the same now , ' @entity139 said			0
' facing a real threat , we must unite even more and secure our historical choice , defend our right to live freely on our land			0
' @entity85 has appealed to both sides to halt all military operations and sit down at the negotiating table			0
however , it remains unclear whether the @entity234 separatists would comply and how much pressure @entity58 would put on them to cease fire			0
@entity85 said today that fighting was continuing , including what he said was artillery fire from the @entity32 side			2
@entity139 has said his troops reserve the right to fire back if separatists attack them or civilians			0
tensions between @entity58 and @entity32 escalated sharply in february when protests in favor of closer @entity32 ties with the @entity130 drove @entity234 president @entity249 from power			2
@entity58 denounced the events as a coup and annexed @entity32 's mostly @entity58 - speaking @entity254 region			1
rebellion in the eastern regions broke out shortly afterward , with @entity32 accusing @entity58 of supporting it			0
