by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 10:41 est , 13 march 2014 more than £ 65billion was spent in @entity2 in 2012 - 13 by @entity3 and @entity4 but only £ 53billion was raised through taxes @entity2 plunged more than £ 12billion into the red last year following a catastrophic collapse in oil revenues that leaves @entity9 ’s independence plans in chaos			1
over £ 65billion was spent north of the @entity11 in 2012 - 13 by @entity3 and @entity4 , but just £ 53billion was raised through taxes			1
the growing ‘ black hole ’ has destroyed @entity13 claims that @entity2 pays more towards the @entity14 than it receives back , and exposes the dangers of building an economy on such a volatile resource as oil			1
the amount of tax generated by @entity2 ’s @entity23 fields plummeted from £ 10billion in 2011 - 12 to just £ 5.6billion – a 41.5 per cent fall – in the wake of unplanned stoppages			1
economic experts last night warned that oil revenues are ‘ likely to have fallen again ’ this year			0
at the same time , the cost of @entity2 ’s massive welfare state continues to grow – increasing by nearly £ 1.3billion to an eye - watering £ 22.4billion			1
as a result , the country ’s deficit has risen from 5.8 per cent to 8.3 per cent , compared to a fall from 7.6 per cent to 7.3 per cent across the @entity14 as a whole			2
the official figures – unveiled by first minister mr @entity9 yesterday morning – mean that every man , woman and child would have been the equivalent of £ 283 worse off in 2012 - 13 if @entity2 was independent			1
and according to the @entity43 , the figure could actually be as high as £ 500			0
however , in an example of the strength of remaining in the @entity47 , that overspend was effectively paid for by taxpayers across the @entity14			0
in a major miscalculation by separatist campaign chiefs , the findings came as they launched an advertising campaign asking @entity2 : ‘ what would you say to living in one of the world ’s wealthiest nations ? ’ the official @entity59 website was quietly altered yesterday after the figures destroyed claims that @entity2 pays more in tax than it receives in spending			2
mr @entity9 yesterday insisted that @entity2 ’s public finances have been healthier than the @entity14 ’s ‘ over the past five years ’			2
but chief secretary to the treasury @entity68 said : ‘ whatever the @entity70 says now , the government of an independent @entity2 would be forced to raise taxes and cut public services			1
’ @entity71 chief secretary to the treasury @entity68 warned an independent @entity2 would have to cut spending and put up taxes she was the poster girl for @entity75 at @entity76			1
now @entity78 gold medallist @entity77 has joined the independence debate by saying she would prefer that the team stayed together			0
the pregnant heptathlete and @entity83 2014 ambassador visited the @entity85 @entity84 and @entity86 yesterday			0
she was joined by @entity88 star and @entity91 silver medallist @entity89 , with whom she shared a room at @entity76			0
when asked how she would feel about losing some of her team mates if @entity59 votes yes , @entity93 said : ' i definitely think one team is a great way to go forward			0
' even though at this @entity91 @entity100 will be competing for @entity2 and some of my other team mates will be competing for @entity102 , we still very much feel like one team			0
' in sport , i would definitely like to stay as one team			0
' former chancellor @entity104 , who is leading the @entity105 campaign , said : ‘ this is a landmark moment in the debate			0
this is the day that @entity9 ’s own figures made the case against independence			0
‘ if @entity2 was independent today we would have no option but to cut spending on services like schools and hospitals or put up taxes – or probably both			2
today as part of the @entity14 we do n’t have to do that			0
‘ oil revenues are a major source of @entity2 ’s income , but are a relatively small part of the @entity14 economy			1
the drop in oil revenue is so big that it is the equivalent of the entire budget for @entity2 schools			2
’ @entity131 leader @entity130 added : ‘ if this was the first day of independence , @entity2 ’s chancellor of the exchequer would be announcing an emergency budget to increase taxes or cut spending on schools , hospitals and universities			2
’ the figures are contained in the annual ‘ government expenditure and revenue @entity2 ’ ( gers ) accounts , released by the country ’s chief statistician			2
including a geographical share of @entity23 oil , @entity2 ’s deficit was £ 12.1billion in 2012 - 13 , compared to £ 8.6billion in 2011 - 12			1
that is the equivalent of 8.3 per cent of @entity152 , while the @entity14 ’s £ 114.8billion deficit was equivalent to 7.3 per cent			2
that 1 percentage point difference is equivalent to £ 1.5billion , or £ 283 per head			0
however , @entity43 chiefs yesterday used a different calculation as they pointed out that @entity2 ’s gdp - per - head is higher than the @entity14			1
due to @entity23 oil , the amount of tax raised north of the @entity11 was £ 800 - per - head higher than the @entity14 as a whole , but spending - per - head was around £ 1,300 higher – leaving a shortfall of £ 500 for every man , woman and child			1
@entity167 , a leading economist at @entity169 ’s @entity168 for @entity170 ( @entity171 ) , said : ‘ measuring @entity2 ’s fiscal position relative to the @entity14 depends heavily on @entity23 oil revenues			2
recent years have , on average , shown the fiscal balance relative to the @entity14 to be marginally in @entity2 ’s favour but , in 2012 - 13 the reverse is now true			1
this is likely to remain the case in 2013 - 14 , as @entity23 revenues are projected to fall again			0
’ @entity179 of the @entity180 ( @entity180 ) , added : ‘ in planning for independence , the @entity70 should be cautious in its fiscal assessment , and avoid building its budget on the back of optimistic forecasts for @entity23 revenues			0
’ but mr @entity9 said : ‘ @entity2 is one of the wealthiest countries in the world			0
‘ the figures show that tax revenues generated in 2012 - 13 were £ 800 higher per head in @entity2 compared with the @entity14 , meaning that now for every one of the last 33 years , tax receipts have been higher in @entity2 than the @entity14			1
‘ over the past five years , @entity2 ’s public finances have been relatively healthier than the @entity14 ’s by a total of £ 8.3billion - the equivalent of nearly £ 1,600 per person			1
’ he said the ‘ net fiscal deficit ’ in @entity2 in 2012 - 13 reflected the ‘ higher level of capital spending in @entity2 which will boost the economy in the long term ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity23 revenues fell by 41.5 per cent between 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13			1
this - in part - was caused by unplanned disruption to production and record capital investment by the oil and gas industry which has doubled since 2010			0
this will reduce tax receipts in the short - term but maximise tax revenues in the future			0

state spent £ 65billion in @entity2 in 2012 - 13 but tax raised only £ 53billion
leaves the @entity218 *'s* claims about *relying* on oil wealth in tatters
@entity14 government wants an independent @entity2 would have to hike taxes
