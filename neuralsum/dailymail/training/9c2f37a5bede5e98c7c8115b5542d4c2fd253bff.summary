' there 's a big gate today , ’ a bald man in the public gallery whispered in broad scouse			0
it was the 118th day of the @entity6 and it was @entity9 ’s turn to give evidence			1
even the @entity12 sir @entity11 , bespectacled coroner in grey three - piece suit , blue tie and blue pocket square , seemed caught up in the hoopla as his counsel , @entity17 , tried to establish @entity9 ’s bone fides. @entity9 arrives at @entity19 to give evidence at the @entity22 inquests but it was tragedy and not his professional abilities that brought @entity27 ’s most venerated player to this court in a @entity19 business park			1
the events of april 15 , 1989 , when 96 supporters were crushed to death at the @entity34 end of @entity22 during @entity27 ’s @entity35 semi-final against @entity37 , defined @entity9 as a legend of his bereft club as much as did his trophy - laden deeds as a player of extravagant ability			1
still , 25 years later , there is no closure for either the grieving relatives or @entity9			2
the furrows on his brow have no doubt been deepened by the trauma of that sunny spring day in @entity53 and its aftermath , which saw him attend up to four funerals a day , before he stepped down as manager , exhausted by duty , 21 months later			2
@entity9 ’s ordeal in this fractious court lasted one hour and 45 minutes			0
@entity9 gave his evidence in the final afternoon session before the hearings adjourn for the @entity66 break having quizzed @entity9 about what he had described in his autobiography as fans ‘ bunking in ’ to watch the 1986 fa cup final against @entity78 at @entity79 , @entity80 , representing some of the police officers involved , then drew the court ’s attention to @entity72 reports of ticketless and drunken @entity27 fans at the 1989 fa cup final , the month after @entity22			1
did people bunk in ? ‘ i have no evidence of people bunking in at @entity79 ( in 1989 ) , ’ said @entity9 , who added that there was ‘ a clamour ’ across @entity85 to ‘ show unity for those who had lost loved ones at @entity22 ’			1
@entity9 walks off the pitch followed by @entity37 boss @entity92 on that tragic day back in april 1989 @entity93 asked if @entity9 thought fans arriving late or drinking too much at @entity22 may have ‘ contributed to the disorder that followed ’			1
lord @entity96 was unimpressed , telling @entity93 that he knew ‘ perfectly well ’ the witness could not answer that question			0
three times the jury and @entity9 left the court as the lawyers argued			0
but despite the odd moment of clear anguish when he relived the day of ‘ mayhem ’ — how he was thankful his own 12 - year - old son , @entity102 , was ok — @entity9 was calm and dignified			1
@entity93 claimed there was a ‘ cohort of @entity27 fans before , during and after @entity22 … who were prone to fight ’			2
@entity9 countered : ‘ @entity27 fans with that exception ( the riot at @entity112 in 1985 ) were very highly respected and revered			1
’ @entity9 was the 160th witness to give evidence in person			2
the @entity6 , started after the attorney general quashed the original verdicts , has heard character portraits of the dead , of how the emergency services acted and how the stadium was prepared			0
the inquests are expected to run until next summer , when a jury of seven men and four women will pronounce on the memory of the 96 fans who perished at a football match			0
@entity27 supporters hold up scarves during a memorial service at @entity131 back in april this year to mark the 25th anniversary of @entity22			0
thousands attended as to remember the 96 who lost their lives those who died are remembered on a memorial at @entity131			0

@entity9 was @entity27 manager on the day of the tragedy
@entity9 was giving evidence at @entity19
he was wearing a @entity27 tie and ' 96 ' badge in tribute to fans who died
