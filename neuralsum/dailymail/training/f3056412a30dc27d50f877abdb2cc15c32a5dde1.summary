in the period drama @entity2 , servants are portrayed as loyal , deferential and discreet			1
but experts claim that finding a modern - day butler with such traits can be a tall order			2
estate agent @entity7 claims that after debt , death and divorce , staffing problems are one of the main reasons behind the sale of country homes			1
while some aspire to own a sprawling estate complete with a gardener , housekeeper , nanny and butler , the dream can turn into a nightmare , it is claimed			2
finding good staff like @entity28 in @entity2 , played by @entity29 ( right ) , is becoming a burden for upper class country home onwers , with good workers ' like gold dust ' , estate agents @entity7 has said in its latest ‘ rural report ’ , @entity7 said that many customers simply can not find the staff			1
this upper - class problem may attract little sympathy , but experts claim that employing workers for a country house ‘ can be a burden without expert help or advice ’			1
the report said issues around recruitment and retention were common problems , while some employees are litigious and ready to sue their boss if they feel their rights are breached			0
it said : ‘ staffing issues – especially if they ever reach the court – can be extremely costly , in terms as time and personal angst , as well as money			0
‘ it is vital to keep abreast of any new rules to avoid being sued by disgruntled employees			0
‘ people are becoming increasingly well - informed about their rights and litigious , especially if they have a high - profile employer			0
’ social media has also caused a fresh headache for employers , who could find their secrets splashed across @entity72 or @entity73 by disgruntled or indiscreet workers			2
@entity7 said anyone hiring staff should ensure they sign confidentiality agreements which includes social media , saying : ‘ domestic staff in particular may have access to very personal aspects of your life , things that you probably do n’t want shared with the entire world			1
’ @entity7 said staff should sign confidentiality agreements to protect the personal lives of their employers from being exposed , as happened in the trial of the aides to @entity94 and ex-husband @entity95 celebrity chef @entity94 and her ex-husband and art dealer @entity95 found their own personal lives exposed after a much - publicised court case involving their assistants @entity100 and @entity103			2

yesterday , @entity7 said a rise in overseas millionaires buying property in the @entity128 meant the demand for good private staff now outweighed supply – enabling the top workers to name their price			1
@entity28 is a much - loved butler in @entity2 , but finding staff like him is proving to be difficult @entity135 , who heads @entity7 ’s consultancy service finding staff for the super-wealthy , said : ‘ owning a country house can very quickly become unenjoyable if the people they have hired are not looking after it as they would like			1
‘ good workers are like gold dust and they do not tend to move around often			1
’ he said that many wealthy people tried to hire couples so that one could do the housekeeping and cooking while the other did outdoor work such gardening , driving and security			0
