@entity0 has warned that a new trade deal with @entity2 will open the door to inferior food , including beef pumped up with growth hormones , banned additives and pesticides			1
there are also concerns that @entity11 crops and food produced in the @entity2 , which have not been through more strict vetting procedures in @entity14 , could be forced on to dinner plates			1
the campaigner and chef held talks this week with business secretary @entity19 to outline his ‘ massive concerns ’ that the deal could seriously undermine @entity23 food and farming			1
concerns : celebrity chef @entity0 has held talks with business secretary @entity19 about his worries that rules to protect food in the @entity23 and @entity14 could be lost with a new free trade pact campaigner : tv chef @entity0 has long been an advocate of quality food and ingredients and has expressed ' massive concerns ' over the potential of a new trade pact with @entity2 the @entity37 and the @entity2 government are negotiating a new free trade pact – known as @entity40 – which will lift barriers to trade in key sectors of the economy across the @entity44			1
the deal will make it easier for companies on both sides of the @entity44 to access each other ’s markets , affecting pharmaceuticals , cars , energy , finance , chemicals , clothing , food and drink			0
however critics like the chef fear it will expose @entity23 families to inferior food and drink which does not meet the higher health and welfare standards that exist in this country and @entity14			1
for example , @entity2 farmers are allowed to pump up beef cattle , which are raised on vast factory farm feed lots rather than in fields , with growth hormones			1
similarly , they are allowed to boost milk production with hormone injections			0
currently , these are banned in @entity14 on the basis of health concerns for consumers			0
@entity23 has effectively banned the use of certain artificial colours from food for children because of an association with hyperactivity , however these are not banned in the @entity2			1
@entity2 farmers can also use pesticides that have been banned in this country as a health risk			1
balance : business secretary @entity19 , pictured , told @entity0 his fears were unfounded however , all these protections could be swept away , according to @entity0 and other critics of the @entity40 proposals – @entity94 – which is the biggest free trade deal in history			1
writing on @entity98 , the chef told followers he had been to see the business secretary ‘ to tell him my massive concerns about any possibility of the @entity23 ’s and @entity14 ’s food standards being compromised ’			1
he said : ‘ we have fought long and hard to get where we are today and i really do n’t want feed lot beef with growth hormones , nor chickens washed with chlorine or food produced with banned pesticides and additives , to name but a few , and i certainly do n’t want our farmers undermined			1
’ mr @entity19 and his officials reassured @entity0 that his fears are unfounded , but he went on to say : ‘ food is still on the negotiating table and that does mean technically anything can still happen			2
‘ i ’m glad they are aware of my concerns , but we must keep watching this space very very carefully			0
’ wholesome : @entity0 , pictured here for @entity0 's @entity124 , says he does n't want ' chickens washed with chlorine or or food produced with banned pesticides and additives ' , allowed in the @entity2 beef : most @entity2 beef cattle are fed with synthetic growth hormones to pump them up , boosting muscle			1
beef from these animals was banned in @entity14 , including @entity23 , in 1989 amid concerns the residues were a cancer risk – particularly breast cancer - in humans dairy : cows in the @entity2 are routinely given the synthetic hormone bovine somatotrophin , which dramatically boost milk production			1
there are raised levels of the hormone in the resulting milk			0
milk and dairy products from the @entity2 were banned in the @entity23 and @entity14 in 2000 because of concerns of a cancer risk to humans and evidence of harm to the cows			1
chicken : farmers in the @entity2 are allowed to feed antibiotics to chicken to speed up growth			1
this practice was banned in @entity23 and @entity14 in 2006 amid concerns it was leading to the emergence of superbug versions of dangerous infections , such as campylobacter and @entity168 in the @entity2 wash chicken carcasses in a chlorine and water solution to kill bugs			1
this was banned in @entity23 and @entity14 in the 1990s because of concerns the residues were a cancer risk			2
additives : artificial colours - @entity178 ( @entity178 ) ; quinoline yellow ( @entity181 ) ; @entity182 ( @entity182 ) ; @entity183 ( @entity183 ) ; @entity184 ( @entity184 ) ; allura red ( @entity186 ) – have been removed from virtually all foods / sweets / drinks aimed at children in the @entity23 on the advice of the @entity192			0
this is based on concerns they are linked to hyperactivity and changes in @entity197 are no such controls in the @entity2 where these additives are commonly used in processed food , including breakfast cereals			1
pesticides : 82 pesticides that are banned in the @entity23 and @entity14 are allowed on @entity2 farms			1
these include @entity206 , which was banned here in 2003 because of evidence it was contaminating water supplies and can disrupt the human hormone system			0
it is still used intensively in the @entity2 or corn , sugar cane and many other crops			2
the @entity2 also allows the use of neonicotinoids			0
two of these have been banned in @entity14 because they harm bees			0
@entity11 : many @entity11 crops such as maize or corn and soya are grown on an industrial scale in the @entity2 and appear in thousands of processed food products - everything from snacks to fast food , breakfast cereal , cooking oils and chocolate			1
these crops have not been subjected to the more rigorous safety assessments that apply in the @entity23 and @entity14			2
the @entity23 government is one of the driving forces in the @entity37 to get the new free trade deal approved			1
it claims @entity40 could add £ 10billion to the @entity23 economy , £ 80billion to the @entity2 and £ 100bn to the @entity37 every year			1
it says shoppers would benefit by the removal of @entity37 import tariffs on popular goods , such as jeans and cars			0
it ’s also claimed that reducing regulation would help @entity23 businesses export to the @entity2 , with small businesses in particular predicted to benefit			2
importantly , it says restrictive markets would be opened up			0
for example , this might mean that a current block on exports of @entity23 lamb and venison to the @entity2 could be lifted			2
@entity259 has promised to put ‘ rocket boosters ’ behind talks to secure the deal , saying @entity40 is central to his vision of a reformed competitive @entity14			0
it is also supported by the @entity265			0
@entity266 , @entity267 and the @entity268 broadly support the pact , as long as caveats are included to ensure protection for the @entity272 from private @entity2 corporations demanding they are allowed to tender for public health services			2
@entity275 is more sceptical and the @entity276 is strongly opposed			0
once the deal is signed , @entity2 companies will be able to take governments in @entity23 and @entity14 to court if they feel their products are being unfairly kept out , which could involve huge financial penalties and compensation			2
the @entity285 business organisation is a major supporter of @entity40			0
its director general , @entity287 , said : ‘ this deal is vital for future growth and the prosperity for citizens across the @entity37			0
and could create thousands of new opportunities for our young people			0
‘ it would create an integrated market of over 800million people , bringing more choices for consumers at cheaper prices			0
and with the @entity23 already trading more and investing more with the @entity2 than any other country , there are real advantages to drive home particularly for smaller firms			2
’ however , @entity306 , senior food campaigner at @entity307 , said : ‘ this trade agreement is a trojan horse that promises jobs but will threaten our food safety , environment and farmers			0
this would mean more @entity11 foods , pollution and factory farms – and less choice for citizens			0
the only winners will be the corporations that push industrially produced foods			0
’ a @entity323 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity325 and @entity324 have both been clear that food safety standards are not up for negotiation in @entity40 and the high standards we enjoy in the @entity23 will never be compromised			0
removing unnecessary barriers to trade will benefit @entity23 exporters and consumers , and all food imports will continue to be subject to @entity37 safety requirements			2

worries @entity11 crops and less vetted food will be forced on dinner plates
chef spoke to business secretary @entity19 about ' massive concerns '
@entity2 farmers often rear beef on vast factory farm feed lots rather than fields
laws allow them to pump animals with growth hormones
concerns come as @entity23 and @entity2 negotiate a new free trade pact
