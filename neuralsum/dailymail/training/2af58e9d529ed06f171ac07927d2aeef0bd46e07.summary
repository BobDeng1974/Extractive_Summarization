' time and place : mr @entity24 was 18 - years - old on august 14 , 1945 when victory over @entity54 was announced			1
at the time , he was on leave from the @entity22 and in @entity51 wandering around @entity6 with a friend mr @entity24 's story sounds a lot like the soldier that @entity15 captured for the famous @entity17 cover			1
' in @entity75 on @entity40 i saw a sailor running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight			2
whether she was a grandmother , stout , thin , old , did n't make a difference ' the photographer recalled in his book @entity15 on @entity15			0

' it represents the unconditional surrender			0
