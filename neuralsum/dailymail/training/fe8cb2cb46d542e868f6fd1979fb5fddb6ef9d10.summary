during a tv documentary charting his final playing season at @entity3 , @entity0 is shown getting angry in the wake of a home defeat to @entity6 in his second game as interim manager			1
his knuckles go white on his car ’s steering wheel			2
three months on , @entity3 ’s new assistant manager is no longer angry as he sits in a low chair in a @entity15 hotel			1
the message , though , is exactly the same			2
‘ the players have got to take a bit of pride in how they perform , train and play , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ there ’s no doubt that few players lived up to the standards of what they are capable of doing last season			1
the way back for them has started already , in training			2
there is no time to waste			2
the recovery has to start now , getting some kind of form			0
‘ that is why i was so disappointed after the @entity6 game			0
the team i put out would have won if they had played to their potential			2
’ @entity3 have a new manager now of course , @entity53 , but the wreckage of last season remains			1
a seventh - place @entity35 finish means no @entity59 football while some of the continent ’s biggest stars have decided to look elsewhere for their career development			1
it ’s tempting to say that @entity0 has seen it all before , but he has n’t			1
he has n’t seen @entity3 off their perch , looking desperately for the credibility and authority that always seemed part of their dna			1
asked if there was fear in @entity3 ’s football at @entity75 last season , @entity0 says : ‘ yeah , there was			1
@entity75 had always been a fortress over the years , the place nobody wanted to go			0
towards the end of last season it was n’t like that			2
‘ you do n’t know if players will be scarred by last season but you hope they respond in a positive way			2
‘ in my first season we lost out in the league against @entity87 and i could n’t wait in the pre-season to get back			2
‘ i wanted to get rid of that feeling i had because until you could do something about it that feeling was always there			0
‘ i ’m sure these players ca n’t wait to get to @entity75 and produce the form they are all capable of			0
’ legend : @entity0 retired as a player after a career which included 963 games and 34 trophies emotional exit : although @entity0 was caught up in the moment he is determined to look to the future now @entity0 , 40 now , has been impressed by @entity104			1
offered the role of assistant after half an hour of chat in a @entity109 hotel last may , he believes he sees some of the great sir @entity110 in his new mentor ’s methods and thinks he sees @entity3 ’s players responding to the 62 - year - old ’s simple , clear methods			1
it will seem strange never to see @entity0 in a red shirt again			1
@entity3 ’s record appearance holder ’s time has finally passed			1
he is n’t overly interested in sentimental reflection , though			0
@entity0 admits he became emotional briefly at the end of last season — wondering if his time at the club was up — but all that disappeared once he met @entity104 in @entity126			1
dominant figures : @entity0 has drawn similarities between sir @entity110 and @entity26 straight to the point : @entity0 claims he was n't asked to be @entity104 's assistant , he was told @entity131 delighted with new - look @entity3 ‘ he was pretty direct about it , ’ recalls @entity0			1
‘ it was after about half an hour of meeting him			0
he straight out asked — or did he tell me ? ! he might have told me actually ! ‘ he just said : “ you ’re my assistant manager ” — or “ i want you to be my assistant ” — and i did n’t think twice			2
it was obviously a tremendous opportunity for me to learn from one of the great managers and stay at the club and try to get better as a coach			2
‘ i do think there are similarities with sir @entity110			1
they do have an aura about them			0
that comes from the success they have had			0
they demand the players respond and they demand respect			0
‘ in the short space of time i have worked with @entity153 you can see why he has been a success			0
on a high : @entity104 's success with @entity157 at the @entity158 has earned him the respect of the @entity3 squad bold : @entity104 's decision making has also earned him praise from @entity0 , such as bringing @entity163 on for @entity157 's penalty shootout win against @entity165 in the quarter - finals ‘ he is infectious			1
he wants everything right from the first minute of training to the last			0
everything he does is clear			0
and everyone gets it straight away			0
‘ he has got a unique way of putting it over and it ’s brilliant to see			0
to see it first - hand is great for my experience and the players			1
‘ what he did at the @entity158 with @entity157 was brilliant , the way he changed his goalkeeper against @entity165 for example			0
if i was the opposition penalty - taker it would be somewhere in my head : “ why have they changed keepers			2
is he someone special ? ” ‘ it ’s what makes top managers — their decision - making			1
if it had gone wrong he would have had to face the consequences			0
that ’s what you ’ve got to do			0
you ’ve got to back what you think is right			0
‘ sometimes it will go wrong but if you stick to your principles usually it will be ok			0
you have to do that if you are manager of @entity3			1
’ with the season looming , @entity3 ’s first steps on the road back to respectability have already been made			1
in @entity0 ’ mind , though , there should be no baby steps			1
two decades at @entity75 have taught him that much			0
asked if a top - four finish would be acceptable this season , his eyes darkened and it was possible to imagine those knuckles whitening on the wheel again			1
‘ no , no , ’ he says			0
‘ with the players we ’ve got i want to be contesting for the league			0
there are people in that dressing room who have won the league many , many times			0
‘ they are winners who were hurt by the way we played last year			0
we ’ll be wanting to win the league			2
’ top dogs : @entity0 insists a top four finish is not enough for @entity3 next season , they must go for the title			1

@entity0 *compares* @entity26 to former manager sir @entity110
@entity0 believes if @entity3 stars play to their potential club can return to top
@entity3 legend adds a top - four finish is not acceptable this season , @entity3 must go for the @entity35 title
@entity104 's will to win is described as infectious by his right - hand man
