by @entity0 @entity2 will today pledge that his @entity4 manifesto will be even more radical than @entity5 ’s			0
he will declare that he wants to go further than both @entity7 ’s @entity6 and the ‘ @entity8 personified by the likes of mr @entity5 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
mr @entity2 will argue that the challenges facing @entity13 are so serious that only sweeping changes will do			1
radical move ? @entity2 vows to go even further with sweeping changes than his predecessors such as @entity5 ( left ) , whose far - left manifesto was famously dubbed ' the longest suicide note in history ' mr @entity5 ’s far - left 1983 manifesto called for mass nationalisation of industry , new taxes on the rich and unilateral nuclear disarmament			1
it was famously dubbed the ‘ longest suicide note in history ’ by one of the party ’s own mps			1
but in a speech to @entity6 ’s @entity33 in @entity34 , mr @entity2 will say : ‘ we have moved on from @entity6			2
' and we are not going back to @entity36			0
' instead , our programme for government is more radical and more ambitious in the change we seek , crafted for the age we are living in and the challenges we face			0
’ @entity6 activists will lay the groundwork for mr @entity2 ’s manifesto at the forum , with policy proposals set to include a return to nationalisation and higher taxes on the rich , with a 50p top rate and ‘ mansion tax ’ widely expected			1
mr @entity2 will say @entity6 needs to ‘ fundamentally reshape our economy ’ in order to tackle ‘ inequality and unfairness ’			2
condemned : @entity2 took a swipe at @entity7 's government for not doing enough to eliminate inequality in a swipe at mr @entity7 ’s @entity6 , he will say : ‘ we did great things in government			1
but we did not do enough to reduce inequality , or eliminate the problem of low pay , or build an economy that will work for the next generation			0
' and the reason is that we did not do enough to change the fundamentals of the economy			0
’ mr @entity2 will also warn activists that @entity6 can not return immediately return to the free - spending ways of the past because of the need to tackle the country ’s huge budget deficit it ran up when the party was last in office			1
and in comments that are likely to provoke further concern among business leaders , he will reiterate his commitment to major interventions in markets that he believes to be failing the general public			0
mr @entity2 will say @entity6 is ‘ moving on from a time when rising inequality was just a fact of life – or when we acted as if there is nothing we could do about markets that are n’t fair or are n’t working ’			2
he will claim that more can indeed be done , by forcing businesses to pay a higher minimum wage and imposing a price freeze on energy firms			0
mr @entity2 will also promise to build 200,000 new homes a year , curb the use of zero - hours contracts and abolish the spare - room subsidy – known by its critics as the bedroom tax .			0
