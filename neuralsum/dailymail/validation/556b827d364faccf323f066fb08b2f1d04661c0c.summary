doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims , drug addicts or those with infections under new plans in a bid to battle the shortage of healthy donors			1
experts say donor organs are declining in quality with more now coming from the elderly or those damaged by lifestyle			0
the @entity15 is trying to increase the numbers of willing organ donors because so many patients are dying waiting for transplants			1
doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims , drug addicts , and those with infections under new plans ( file picture ) and one of the plans reportedly been considered is offering patients transplants using organs from people who would have usually had them rejected after being deemed to ' high - risk '			1
according to the @entity34 , the proposals would create a special ' fast track ' waiting list for the high risk organs			1
dr @entity38 , director of transplantation at @entity40 , told the newspaper : ' one of the things that we have been looking at is trying to match risk with risk			0
' there are people on the lost who are willing to take that risk , accept kidneys from people with known infection risk or cancer risk			2
' organs are deemed high risk if they come from cancer patients , intravenous drug users and those with a history of having high - risk sex lives			1
however , @entity40 have said they rejected a research proposal looking into high - risk organ donation			1
a spokesperson said : ' @entity64 submits hundreds of research proposals and applications for funding every year			0
' this was an application for funding for a research project looking in to offering patients at risk of dying without transplantation organs considered high risk			1
' this proposal was rejected by the funding body and therefore will not be progressing any further			0
' @entity77 , 42 , left , and @entity78 , 67 , right , both died after receiving kidneys infected with meningitis - causing parasitic worms last year , it emerged that at least a quarter of all transplants that took place last year involved ‘ high - risk ’ organs that could be damaged or infected			1
figures obtained from @entity87 , the authority which oversees donations , show that last year , 333 patients were given high - risk organs			1
this represented a quarter of the 1,320 transplanted and included donors who were former addicts , cancer sufferers or those aged over 71			2
the 333 figure was almost certainly an underestimate because it does not include donations from smokers , the obese or the very sexually active who may have @entity101 or other infections			0
but @entity103 , who worked for @entity104 before emigrating to @entity105 , warned the @entity15 drive to increase donations was flawed			2
it comes after it emerged that two patients had died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic infected with a rare parasitic worm			0
the relatives of @entity77 , 42 , and grandfather @entity78 , 67 , say they were never told about the lifestyle of the donor by doctors at @entity115 in @entity116			0
mr @entity78 and mr @entity77 both underwent the operations at the @entity118 in @entity116 ( pictured ) in 2013 and died within three weeks the organs belonged to a 39 - year - old alcoholic with cirrhosis and had been rejected by hospitals in @entity123 and @entity124 before they were accepted by the @entity115 in @entity116			2
the man had died of meningitis from an unknown cause and the mystery behind his death had stopped surgeons in @entity131 , @entity104 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 from accepting his kidneys			0
mr @entity103 , who is a transplant surgeon and liver specialist , said : ‘ we were regularly offered donors that i considered to be very high risk			2
we were offered organs of patients who were dying of widespread sepsis ( blood infection )			2
‘ i was offered organs from patients with a history of recent and significant high grade cancer , which has a high risk of transmission			1
‘ we were offered livers from patients who were actually dying of liver failure			0
the vast majority of transplants that do take place in the @entity158 are successful and that ’s due to the dedication and hard work of the whole transplant community			0
last year – 2013/2014 – there were 4,655 transplants , an increase of 10 per cent on the year before .			0

@entity15 is trying to increase the number of organ donors due to a shortage
more and more people are dying while they wait for organ transplants
under new plans , doctors could give patients organs that are ' high - risk '
would come from cancer victims , drug addicts and those with infections
comes after figures showed a quarter of transplants in 2013 involved ' high - risk ' organs
