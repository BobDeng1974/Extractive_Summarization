by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 19:15 est , 18 march 2013 rising numbers of hospitals are failing to respect the dignity and privacy of patients , the care watchdog warns			2
nearly a fifth do n’t meet national standards for ensuring patients – many of them elderly – are treated with proper compassion and consideration			1
this marks a sharp rise on the findings of the same survey carried out by the @entity17 the previous year			0
failure : nearly a fifth of hospitals do n't meet national standards for ensuring patients - many of them elderly - are treated with proper compassion and consideration ( file picture ) some elderly patients say they are too frightened to call for help at night in case they are told off by nursing staff for ‘ interfering ’ , the @entity17 report said			1
on other wards , staff risk embarrassing patients by putting the names of those who need a catheter on display on notice boards			1
the @entity17 also found that staff had filled - in ‘ @entity42 ’ forms – apparently without getting consent from patients or their families			1
in some wards , basic privacy was not respected because the curtains were not shut around beds when patients were examined			2
over the last 12 months the watchdog inspected 50 hospitals and found 18 per cent were not meeting national standards for treating patients with dignity and respect			1
last year 12 per cent were found to be not adhering to these requirements			2
although this is only a snapshot of the 300 hospitals across the @entity58 , there are concerns that the failings are widespread			0
some elderly patients say they are too frightened to call for help at night in case they are told off by nursing staff for ' interfering ' the findings come a month after a devastating report into the @entity68 hospital scandal in which hundreds died due to neglect			1
there is now growing concern that similar failings exist in hospitals across the health service			0
the report comes as the @entity76 continues to fight for better standards in hospitals through its dignity for the @entity80			2
the @entity17 warns that although hospitals have made improvements in ensuring patients have enough to eat and drink , too many are failing to provide ‘ basic care			2
’ @entity86 , chief executive of the @entity17 said : ‘ it is disappointing people are still not being given enough privacy and that they are left alone when they call for help			0
‘ this is basic care and getting it right can transform a stressful experience for an older person into a supportive and caring one			0
‘ @entity95 , good quality care is not complex or time - consuming			0
’ scandal : the findings come a month after a report into the @entity68 hospital ( @entity102 hospital pictured ) scandal in which hundreds died due to neglect inspectors found staff were talking over patients as if they were n’t there or making them wait if they rang call - bells			1
on one ward inspectors found that two thirds of ‘ @entity42 ’ forms had been filled - in without seeking the consent of the patient or their family			1
the forms state that doctors should not try to revive the patient should their heart stop beating			0
they should only be signed following detailed discussions with the patient or their family members			0
one patient told inspectors that they were frightened to call for help at night because they had earlier been told off by a hospital worker for ‘ interfering ’			1
they had tried to warn the nurse that another patient was ringing their call - bell but a member of staff had ‘ displayed annoyance ’			1
in another hospital , inspectors saw one worker tell a colleague ‘ i think you ’ve got a lost cause there ’ because the patient they were trying to feed had fallen asleep			0
the report found that one in three hospitals were failing to meet all five national standards on respect , feeding patients , protecting them from abuse , keeping adequate records and having a safe number of staff			1
one , @entity150 , in @entity151 , did not meet any of these requirements while @entity154 hospital in @entity155 met just one			0
@entity156 of the @entity157 said : ‘ call bells going unanswered and people left to soil their beds because they do n’t get help going to the toilet is an utter disgrace			0
pockets of poor care on this scale are unacceptable and typify the cultural change needed			0

elderly patients too frightened to call for help for fear they are ' interfering '
