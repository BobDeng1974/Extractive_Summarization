at the start of the conference at his office in @entity13 , colonel @entity10 said : ' during my entire service as a civilian and later military prosecutor , i have never brought shame to the @entity18 and i will protect the honour of an officer of the @entity1 armed forces and prosecution			1
' thank you , please give me a five - minute break , i need to rest , ' @entity10 said , as the reporters then leave the room			2

he added that @entity10 had suffered injuries to his face			1
@entity10 is a deputy head of the prosecutor 's office and the head of a local department investigating organised crime in the army			1
he then asked the reporters to leave as he ' needs a rest ' with the camera still rolling , he crosses to the other side of his office after the journalists have left after shooting himself , his body slumped to the floor , with just his shoe visible in the frame ( arrowed ) he had asked the reporters to leave his office after he criticised media leaks from the continuing probe into the plane crash in @entity72 on april 10 , 2010 , that killed then - president @entity74 and 95 others , mostly senior @entity1 officials			1
during his brief news conference , @entity10 said the military prosecutor 's office had the right to seek phone records of journalists covering the investigation of the crash			1
he read a statement to reporters in which he objected to plans by prosecutor general @entity88 to put military prosecutors under civilian authority			0
@entity88 said that such a decision has not been made yet			0
@entity10 also said that military prosecutors were proving themselves competent in the many probes that they have opened into organised crime cases inside the army			2
@entity10 was taken to hospital , where he is in a stable condition with injuries to his face the death toll from the plane crash included the country 's president and wife , its central bank head and the country 's military chief along with other senior government and military figures dead : @entity1 president @entity74 and wife @entity112 were among those who perished in the crash the probes primarily concern suspicions of corruption in buying equipment for @entity1 's troops on missions in @entity121 and , earlier , in @entity122			1
@entity10 denied media suggestions that the military prosecutors broke the law while investigating the crash			1
the media have alleged that the prosecutors had sought billing lists and text message content of mobile phones of some reporters to determine the source of leaks to the media			0
several news outlets showed footage of @entity10 's body behind his desk before an ambulance took him to a hospital			2
a spokesman for the military prosecutor 's office was not available for comment			2
' according to the information available , the prosecutor is alive , he is being treated in the hospital and the site is being investigated by the prosecutors and military police , ' said spokesman of @entity13 military prosecutors office @entity153			0
@entity1 president @entity154 said in a statement he was ' concerned ' about the suicide attempt and asked the head of the national security bureau to monitor the situation			2
some lawmakers are calling for a special parliamentary probe into the case			0
the wreckage of the @entity1 president 's plane lies in woodland near @entity168 airport in @entity72 @entity72 fully blamed @entity1 for the deadly plane crash which killed the @entity1 president			1
@entity72 officials investigating the plane crash that killed @entity74 said the crew was pressured to land in bad weather by an air force commander who had been drinking			1
@entity74 and 95 others , including his wife , died in april 2010 when their plane crashed while trying to land in @entity168 , @entity72			0
officials of the @entity182 , which investigates crashes in much of the @entity184 , said that the pilots were pressured to land by @entity1 's air force commander , general @entity186 , who was in the cockpit			1
they said he had a blood - alcohol level of about 0.06 percent , enough to impair reasoning			0
@entity186 's presence in the cockpit ' had a psychological influence on the commander 's decision to take an unjustified risk by continuing the descent with the predominant goal of landing against the odds , ' the committee chairwoman @entity191 told a news conference last january			0
the report found no fault with @entity72 air traffic controllers			0
@entity1 officials have already complained that previous drafts of @entity72 's report should have questioned whether controllers should have allowed the plane to land in poor visibility			1

@entity74 and his delegation were on their way to attend a ceremony commemorating the victims of the 1940 katyn massacre , in which 20,000 @entity1 officers and other prisoners of war were killed by the @entity226 secret police			2
the symbolic importance of @entity74 's planned visit apparently increased the pressure to land the aircraft despite the poor conditions			0
but the head of the committee 's technical commission , @entity235 , said there was no ' concrete command ' from @entity74 to land			0
the blood - alcohol content found in @entity239 was lower than what is generally considered outright intoxication			0
but the professional pilots and physicians group says ' the number of serious errors committed by pilots dramatically increases at or above concentrations of 0.04 percent , ' lower than @entity186 's level .			0

@entity10 had just defended military probe into leaks relating to plane crash that killed @entity1 's president
he is in stable condition with injuries to his face
