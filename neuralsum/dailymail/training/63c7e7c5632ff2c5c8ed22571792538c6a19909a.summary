by @entity0 sunseekers enjoying the great outdoors this weekend were shocked to see the clear blue skies obscured - by clumps of falling hay			1
clusters of dry grass were reported raining down on several parts of the @entity9 as @entity9 basked in warm sunshine over the past few days			1
homes in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 were hit , leaving many with a thick layer of hay to sweep from their cars , lawns and gardens			1
from above : clumps of hay falling down from the skies were seen in locations like @entity26 , @entity14 , pictured swirling : experts at the @entity28 said that thermal air currents were behind the odd phenomenon the bizarre sight was filmed by @entity32 , 42 , who was covered when he got off the bus near his home in @entity35 on saturday afternoon			1
@entity32 , a self - employed bathroom fitter , said : ' i looked up and i could see all this hay			2
' there was no wind , so i assume it was something to do with thermals			0
' it was swirling around anti-clockwise and it was quite high in the sky , about the height seagulls fly at			0
' the hay must have been picked up from a nearby field and then come down			2
' i used to live in @entity48 and you have what they call " dust devils " there , but i have never seen anything like this			0
' hot and dry : the weather , combined with large numbers of people cutting hay and mowing lawns , allowed dry hay and grass to travel over the country in air currents			1
pictured is @entity32 near his home in @entity35 , @entity12 @entity68 , 59 , had his outdoor sunday lunch interupted when huge lumps of hay fell on him and his wife @entity72 , 47 , and daughter @entity73 , 16 , near @entity26 , @entity14			1
the electrical engineer said : ' it was quite an amazing event			0
' i was even more surprised when i came into the office today to hear from colleagues that it only happened in half of the village - there seems to have been a cut - off point half way			0
' it really was quite a peculiar thing to see			0
we were sitting having lunch in the garden when at first we say just a few little bits coming down			0
' soon it was huge great lumps coming down , covering the garden , the cars , and the caravan			0
it was all over the place			0
' it seems the dry rain began earlier in the week , with the first report coming from @entity100 who was showered in hay in @entity102 , @entity13 , on thursday			1
she said : ' we were having drinks in the @entity107 garden when we saw shaped clumps of hay like material spiralling down from high up in the sky , no wind			2
' it â€™s even more mysterious as it happened in two different parts of @entity9 days apart			0
' the most northern reports of the phenomenon came from surprised people in @entity16 , who saw lumps of hay soaring through the air on sunday			1
@entity123 , 20 , from @entity124 , @entity16 , said she spotted a small tornado before the hay started to rain down			1
@entity127 from nearby @entity128 added : ' i saw grass falling from the sky			1
it was the weirdest thing i have ever seen			0
' at first i thought it was a load of feathers until it got closer			0
then i saw it was clumps of hay and grass ' how the hell can this happen in three different places in the @entity9 within three days ? weird			2
' continual : falling hay was reported in @entity13 on thursday , @entity12 on saturday , @entity16 yesterday and then again in @entity15 on sunday ' swirling ' : people reported that the grass formed tornado - like formations before falling from the sky in clumps @entity148 from near @entity149 in @entity15 took to @entity150 to report the odd weather he experienced on sunday evening			1
he wrote : ' @entity152 was full of it for 10 mins or so falling from a very high altitude			0
' weather experts said the bizarre raining hay was down to rising hot air and warm plumes of cloud - free air			1
first : some people mentioned the falling grass and hay as early as thursday in @entity13 @entity28 spokesman @entity162 said : ' we 've had a couple of weeks of dry weather across much of the country and that has allowed the ground to dry and warm up , and this weather has been ideal for farmers to cut grass for hay etc. ' this grass has been lifted into the air by some means , possibly by convection - where the ground heats the air above it causing the air to rise and carrying the grass aloft - and it is then carried along by warm thermals			1
' a thermal is a warm bubble or plume of cloud - free air that rises from the ground as the ground is heated and cools the higher it gets			2
' thermals are used by birds to climb with little effort and by glider pilots to gain extra lift during a flight			0
' because the air eventually cools the thermal will break down and the grass will fall from the sky			2

reports of clumps of dry grass falling began on thursday in @entity13
phenomenon also observed in @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity15 this weekend
weather experts say the falling hay was *sucked* up and moved by warm air
the effect was especially *noticeable* thanks to farmers cutting hay en masse
