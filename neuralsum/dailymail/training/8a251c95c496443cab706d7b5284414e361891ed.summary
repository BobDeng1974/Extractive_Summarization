the @entity1 's top secret military plane which has orbited the @entity2 for nearly two years is set to finally land this week , and could touch down today			1
the @entity4 space drone , otherwise known as the @entity5 , has been in flight since december 2012 on a secret mission			1
the mystery spacecraft , which skeptics say could be used for spying , is expected to land at the @entity11 in @entity12			1
skeptics believe the 29ft ( 8.8m ) shuttle 's mission is defense or spying - related , but the military plane 's purpose remains a highly - guarded secret			1
in 2011 , amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first @entity4 which included flyovers of @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance			1
the @entity5 , which is solar powered , is designed to land automatically			0
two hangars at the @entity46 base have been cleared , ready for its arrival			0
colonel @entity49 , @entity50 wing commander , said : ' @entity46 stands ready to implement safe landing operations for the @entity52 , the third time for this unique mission			0
' the mystery spacecraft , which skeptics say could be being used for spying , is expected to land at the @entity11 in @entity12 the @entity4 is too small to carry people onboard , but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck , which is just large enough to carry a small satellite the plane has been in space for a total of 672 days , far more than its two previous flights which lasted 225 and 469 days			1
the @entity1 's unmanned @entity4 space plane has flown three secret missions to date			1
each time it has carried a mystery payload on long - duration flights in @entity2 orbit			1
the spacecraft looks similar to @entity75 's space shuttle but is much smaller			2
the @entity4 is about 29ft ( 8.8m ) long and 9.5ft ( 2.9 m ) tall			2
it has a wingspan of just less than 15ft ( 4.6 m )			0
at launch , it weighs 11,000lbs ( 4,990kg )			0
the craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to @entity2			2
the program 's first mission launched in april 2010 and landed in december that year			2
the second space plane took off on march 2011 and came back to @entity2 in june 2012			0
according to @entity4 manufacturer @entity86 , the space plane operates in low - earth orbit , between 110 and 500 miles above earth			1
by comparison , the @entity89 orbits at about 220 miles			0
both top secret missions ended at @entity92 , but this may soon change as @entity86 , which built the shuttles , is working to renovate a @entity75 hangar at the @entity96 , which could become @entity4 's new home			1
all missions so far have launched from @entity16 , @entity99			0
while the airplane looks like @entity75 's retired space shuttles , it has its own identity			0
like a shuttle , it is blasted into orbit by a rocket			0
however , it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft			0
the @entity4 is too small to carry people onboard , but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck , which is just large enough to carry a small satellite			2
according to @entity4 manufacturer @entity86 , the space plane operates in low - earth orbit , between 110 and 500 miles above earth			1
by comparison , the @entity89 orbits at about 220 miles all three missions so far have launched from @entity16 , in @entity99			0

the @entity1 's top secret military @entity4 plane will land this week
the spacecraft has been on a mystery mission for nearly two years
skeptics say the plane may have been used to spy on other countries
the craft could finally land in @entity12 today after 22 months in orbit
