by @entity0 published : 00:06 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 02:14 est , 12 july 2013 more than four - fifths of people can not identify an ash tree from its leaves and almost half can not recognise an oak , a survey has revealed			1
members of the public are being encouraged to report signs of diseases which are threatening @entity13 trees , such as ash dieback , as part of efforts to tackle infection which could wipe out millions of trees across the countryside			1
but many people can not even identify some of the @entity23 's most common trees that are at risk , a poll conducted for the @entity25 suggests			2
spot the difference : four in five people could not identify an ash tree ( left ) by its leaves , while half did not recognise an oak tree ( right ) , the survey by the @entity25 found only 17 per cent of those shown an ash leaf could say what tree it came from , despite the high profile of @entity38 ash dieback , which experts have warned could have the same effect on ash trees as @entity43 elm disease had on @entity13 elms			1
and 57 per cent could identify an oak , one of the country 's most common and recognisable trees			0
oaks are at risk from disease such as acute oak decline , which causes bleeding and lesions on stems and tree death			0
one in 10 mis - identified an oak leaf as coming from a sycamore tree , the survey of 2,050 adults by @entity58 revealed found			1
the situation is most acute among young people who appear to be losing touch with nature , with less than two - fifths ( 39 per cent ) able to identify an oak tree from its leaf and only one in 10 able to identify an ash leaf			2
older people were best able to recognise trees , with more than two - thirds ( 68 per cent ) of over- 55s identifying an oak and almost a quarter ( 23 per cent ) able to correctly name an ash leaf			2
the @entity25 said it needs people to report signs of disease , such as ash dieback ( pictured ) one in 10 of the adults asked thought an oak leaf ( pictured ) came from a sycamore tree those in north - east @entity84 and @entity85 struggled most to correctly identify oak leaves , with just 40 per cent getting it right , while less than one in 10 ( 9 per cent ) people in the @entity89 could name an ash leaf			1
the @entity25 is warning that a lack of knowledge about trees among members of the public could hamper efforts to stop the increasing risk of pests and diseases which @entity23 trees face			0
@entity102 , head of conservation at the @entity25 , said : ' we are relying on people to report the signs of disease and pests in their local woods , so if more people were able to identify common trees like ash and oak , it would make tracking the spread easier			1
' we are calling for increased education on native trees and disease identification before it 's too late			0
' we need to learn about and love trees and woods or we risk losing them			0
' he added that there was a clear trend from the findings that younger people were less engaged with nature			0
there were currently 15 tree diseases listed by the @entity130 as being present in the country , with another five with the potential to arrive here , he said			1
' it is of massive importance that we give everyone the skills to help tackle tree diseases , otherwise our native trees will be under threat			0
' in order to tackle diseases and pests and protect our trees from future threats , it 's imperative we increase the nation 's understanding , ' he said .			0
