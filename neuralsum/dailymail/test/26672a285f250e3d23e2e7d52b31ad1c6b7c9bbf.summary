together they wrote a string of chart - topping hits for some of the world 's biggest stars and created the memorable theme tune of @entity9 television soap @entity7			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , who were married for more than three decades , were dubbed ' mr and mrs music ' after composing for artists including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
so when @entity11 died last month aged 74 after a long battle with cancer , @entity10 was expected to be at her funeral to say a final goodbye			1
true , their marriage had ended in divorce , but they had a daughter together and one of the most successful creative unions in showbusiness			0
but @entity34 can reveal that @entity10 was banned from the funeral by @entity11 's second husband , @entity36 , who today accuses the composer of breaking his wife 's heart			1
although they were responsible for about 400 songs together , they had been mired in a long - running feud over seven that @entity11 claimed she co-wrote			2
after years of pressure , says @entity36 , @entity10 agreed to acknowledge @entity11 's part and her name now appears against some of the songs on the @entity10 website			1
but on other songs , @entity10 is the only composer credited			0
@entity36 told @entity34 : ' yes , i banned @entity10 from attending @entity11 's cremation			1
' the 71 - year - old former policeman , who married @entity11 in 2005 , said : ' it might seem petty and churlish of me because , whatever anybody says , @entity10 and @entity11 are welded at the hip for all the wonderful work they did together			1
' i would never contest that			0
but her firm words to me were , " i hate him for what he did to me and for what he 's still doing to me			0
" ' i could n't and would n't contact @entity10 myself			0
it would be inappropriate because we 're in litigation			0
' instead , he passed the message to @entity11 's son from her first marriage , @entity88 , who @entity10 had adopted when they married			1
@entity36 said : ' @entity88 rang , giving it the smooth patter of , " oh , they had such a lovely warm life together " , which they did not			0
and when he said he wanted to invite @entity10 to the cremation , i said quite firmly , " no. if he turns up , i shall call the police			0
" ' suffice it to say that @entity11 would not want @entity10 anywhere near her final moments on this earth			1
he and his wife were specifically banned from attending her funeral , or anything in connection with it			2
' @entity11 always told me , " no service – just you			0
" ' the cremation was held on the @entity112 island of @entity113 , where @entity11 lived with @entity36			0
it is also home to @entity10 and his wife			2
@entity10 , 75 , clearly got the message , writing on his @entity119 page on the day of the funeral : ' today was final departure day for her soul but i was banned by her husband @entity36 from attending the crematorium			1
' @entity36 now plans to bring @entity11 's ashes home to @entity127 for a memorial service in may at her local parish church in @entity131 , @entity132			2
much of @entity11 's wealth , he said , had recently been eroded – not least by the legal battle with her former husband over the songs , which @entity36 claimed has cost about £ 20,000			2
it 's a far cry from 1965 when @entity10 and @entity11 met and fell in love			1
@entity10 was already married and the couple embarked on an affair before marrying the next year and going on to become one of the most successful teams in music , earning millions of pounds			0
but if @entity10 , the son of a pianist , who grew up in @entity147 , @entity148 , and @entity11 , the daughter of a miner from @entity152 - under - @entity151 , made a fortune , they seemed to have trouble holding on to it			1
the couple moved to @entity156 at one point because of its tax benefits for artists			0
@entity10 wrote the theme tune to @entity161 and is still remembered by many as the ' mr @entity164 ' judge on 1970s tv talent show @entity166			2
in 1982 , the pair moved to @entity9 and were later asked to write the theme song for @entity7			0
their marriage ended abruptly and abrasively back in @entity127 at @entity11 's 55th birthday party in 1995 , when @entity10 confessed that for years he had been in love with one of his wife 's friends			1
@entity36 plans to persevere with @entity11 's legal battle over the disputed songs : ' not for financial gain – @entity11 was getting her share [ of songwriting royalties ] – but because it was her dying wish that he finally admitted she co-wrote those songs			2
' @entity10 declined to comment .			0

but he did not attend her funeral when @entity11 died at the age of 74 last month
