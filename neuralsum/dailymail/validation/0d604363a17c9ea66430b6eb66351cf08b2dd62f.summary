swinging from crying to flying into a rage , the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by @entity16 but on learning of @entity0 ’s emotional , mental and physical state dr @entity16 could not ‘ in good conscience ’ go on with the interview			1

' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to @entity9 , 22 , ending up face down in her tub			1
just two days ago @entity9 's aunt , @entity117 , made a series of explosive @entity120 posts in which she alleged that the family had ' strong evidene of foul play ' relating to @entity0 's role in events			1
she posted : ' @entity0 is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family			2
moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do ! ' @entity117 made her claims in response to being invited onto dr @entity16 's show			2
tough to watch : the young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer in her message she wrote : ' with all due respect , @entity0 is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece …			2
we have strong evidence of foul play			0
' marks were found on her face and arms , marks that @entity0 has explained as the result of cpr which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived			2
and speaking to dr @entity16 , @entity0 insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them [ @entity4 and @entity9 ]			1
' railing against the decision by @entity9 's father , @entity157 , to ban him from his fiancée 's bedside at @entity161 's @entity160 , @entity0 said : ' my name will be the first she calls			1
' according to his mother , @entity27 , @entity0 can not forgive himself for his ' failure ' to revive @entity9			1
his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier			0
' i hate @entity157 ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father @entity157 , who has blocked him from seeing the 22 - year - old in the hospital ' are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. @entity16 asks about @entity0 's sobriety refuses to go : the 25 - year - old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help resigned : ultimately , @entity0 concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility then , on 11 february 2012 , it was @entity0 who tried to resuscitate @entity4 when she was found unresponsive in her bath - tub just hours before she was due to attend a @entity186 awards party			1

" @entity0 has now entered a rehab facility in @entity161			1

it is now six weeks since @entity9 – @entity70 as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath - tub of the home she shared with @entity0 in @entity23 , @entity24			1
unlike @entity4 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating @entity9 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22 - year - old as a criminal investigation			1
while @entity9 fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with @entity0 , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged			1
in an interview with @entity214 a friend of the couple , @entity217 , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , @entity52 , pot and heroin substitute @entity223			2
sounding eerily similar to @entity9 's mother and father 's drug - dependent relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on			1
' @entity9 and @entity0 would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had			1
it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs			0
' there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed			2
there were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice			0
she was always covered in cigarette burns			0
' their relationship was also very volatile			0
' when @entity4 died @entity0 was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control @entity70 to get access to the money			2
she 'd do whatever he told her			0
' he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her			0
they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around			0
' according to @entity217 : ' but @entity70 really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother			0
she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her			0
@entity0 knew this and took advantage of it			2
' troubled relationship : a friend of the couple , @entity217 , claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin , @entity52 , pot and heroin substitute @entity223			2
