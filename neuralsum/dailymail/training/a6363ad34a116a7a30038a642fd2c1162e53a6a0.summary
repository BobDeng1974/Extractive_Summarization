by @entity0 published : 20:01 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 24 may 2013 complaints : @entity4 's @entity3 at the @entity5 has been branded too suggestive for young audiences raunchy pop videos are to be forced to carry age ratings , ministers said yesterday			1
they are closing a legal loophole that has allowed youngsters to buy sexually explicit and ultra violent material without restriction			1
there are already age restrictions on feature films but a range of pop videos , sports releases , religious and educational dvds and @entity22 discs are classed as exempt			1
in one case , topless lap - dancing was considered exempt on the basis it was an exercise video			1
semi-naked cage fighting has also been free from classification because it was deemed a sport			0
campaigners have also warned about depictions of self - mutilation , erotic dancing , sex toys and drug use being widely available to youngsters as dvds			1
@entity39 communications minister @entity38 yesterday announced the @entity40 is being changed to enable age ratings to be given to dvds that are currently exempt			1
products that are deemed unsuitable for children will have to carry the familiar @entity46 age ratings : 12 , 15 and 18			0
the changes are expected to come into force next year and will apply to all new releases			0
mr @entity38 said : ‘ government realises that the world has moved on since these exemptions were written into the @entity40 30 years ago			1
‘ the changes we ’ve announced will help ensure children are better protected and parents are provided with the information necessary for them to make informed choices about what their children view			1
’ the minister also wants the industry to ‘ develop solutions so more online videos – particularly those likely to be sought out by children and young people – carry advice about their age suitability ’			2
examples of currently exempt dvds attracting complaints to the @entity46 include @entity4 , live at @entity73 – a concert recording in which the singer dances suggestively in her underwear			1
ultimate fighting championship dvds – a series with images of bloodied sporting violence – have also caused upset			2
@entity82 , chief executive of the @entity81 , made the dvd age rating recommendation in his independent review into the commercialisation and sexualisation of children in 2011			2
he yesterday welcomed the government ’s announcement but said he wanted the digital world to also adopt age ratings because children can download inappropriate videos off the internet			0
of age ratings , he said : ‘ it ’s giving parents , but also children and young people , the opportunity to decide whether something is appropriate or not			0
you would n’t go to the cinema without looking at what rating a film is beforehand			0
‘ some material in music videos is either very violent or misogynistic or its very sexually explicit			2
‘ many parents would feel very shocked if they realised their children were encountering it			0
’ @entity109 , a respected clinical psychologist , said : ‘ this will help parents as they ’re not always up with what their kids are watching			0
vulnerable : psychologists worry that parents often do not know what their children are watching ‘ videos are something that you ’re not aware of the implicit messages they sometimes send			0
we know , whether it ’s using derogatory language towards women or having them as decorative objects , all these things send a really negative message and objectify women and young girls and give kids an unhealthy script about how to relate to each other			0
’ the government also announced that wireless internet providers are working to make publicly available @entity140 ‘ family - friendly ’ in places such as cafes and restaurants			1
the firms will automatically block pornography websites or encourage their business providers to adopt filtering services at sites where children may have access to their free service			0
@entity149 , the children and families minister , said : ‘ through the @entity152 @entity151 we will push for a firmer commitment from @entity140 providers , retailers , shops and cafes so parents are reassured their children will not be able to access pornography when they are away from home			2
’ the @entity160 also announced updated guidance to members to help promote ‘ responsible childrenswear retailing ’ .			2
