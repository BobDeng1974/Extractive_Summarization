by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 10 november 2012 updated : 18:30 est , 10 november 2012 celebrating : baroness @entity1 calls for @entity2 of all religions to join in each others ' celebrations whoever chose @entity1 ’s study when she was moved to the @entity8 in the @entity10 reshuffle two months ago must have had a keen sense of history			1
of all the rooms they could have given her , they chose one in the part of the @entity8 still known as the old @entity19			2
it was from here that the @entity2 ruled @entity22 , including the @entity24 ’s native @entity23 before it became independent			1
her ministerial study is directly opposite the magnificent centrepiece of the @entity19 , the marble - floored @entity27 with its three storeys of doric , ionic and corinthian columns			2
built when @entity33 @entity32 was on the throne , it was modelled on @entity22 durbars – courts where native princes held receptions for visiting @entity2 dignitaries at the height of the @entity41			1
when i started our interview at the @entity19 by admiring @entity27 , @entity1 winced at my clunking @entity45 ‘ der - baah ’ pronunciation of the word			1
‘ it is drrr - ba , ’ she said , lending an exotic musical flourish to the prolonged ‘ drrr ’ and clipped ‘ ba ’			2
i could almost hear sitars in the background			2
born in @entity55 , @entity56 , the second of five daughters of @entity23 immigrants , she had a successful career in the law before being made a @entity63 peer			2
she is as @entity67 and refined as the @entity27 , yet as down - to - earth and homely as @entity56 pudding			2
she calls herself a working - class @entity69 mum , yet sends her children to private school			1
her accent is half @entity23 and half @entity56 , and she is fiercely proud of both			2
after being appointed @entity2 ’s first woman @entity76 cabinet minister in 2010 , @entity1 came close to being humiliated when @entity77 moved her out of her job as @entity63 chairman in the september reshuffle			1
unnamed conservative mps ran a whispering campaign against her , claiming she was n’t up to it and had been given the post only because the prime minister was desperate to break up the serried ranks of white and overwhelmingly male @entity63 faces around the @entity10 table			1
even more wounding , it was alleged that her brash successor as chairman , @entity91 , ran a successful campaign to grab the post from her			2
certainly , she has shed no tears over @entity91 ’s abrupt fall from grace following bizarre disclosures that he used an alter ego , @entity98 , in a parallel career as a downmarket internet entrepreneur			2
when i mentioned @entity91 ’s troubles , a beatific smile spread across her face			2
‘ he ’s had a real baptism of fire , it ’s been awful , ’ she said , archly			2
‘ he ’s had the grief after a month that i had after a year			0
fighting talk : @entity1 in deep conversation with @entity112 's political editor @entity0 at the @entity8 @entity91 is n’t the only one to discover how @entity1 fights like a tigress			1
when @entity77 asked her to move to a more junior role at the @entity8 , she faced being stripped of her @entity10 place			0
she made three demands : a new title , that of senior minister of state , adding the ‘ senior ’ to signal she was foreign secretary @entity122 ’s deputy , at least in name ; the retention of her @entity10 seat ; and the additional role of @entity126 , @entity128 jargon for @entity129			1
only the canniest of politicians get to the top of ethnic politics in @entity2			1
she is barely 5ft tall , yet her warmth and presence more than fill her palatial office , with its towering 30ft ceiling			0
with @entity63 support among black and @entity141 voters pathetically low , @entity77 could hardly risk having a woman – and a @entity76 to boot – walking out on him			0
and which white @entity63 could possibly tackle thorny issues , such as the grooming of vulnerable young white girls by @entity23 men in @entity69 towns like @entity148 , with her courage and credibility ? more than 800,000 schoolchildren – one in eight – do not speak @entity152 as their mother tongue			1
critics say schools ’ resources are being stretched as heads are forced to recruit foreign language assistants to help migrant children			1
some 240 different languages are spoken in @entity162 ’s schools including @entity163 , @entity1 ’s native @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			1
in some schools , more than 50 languages are spoken			0
taxpayers foot an annual £ 140 million bill for translation services , including £ 64,000 a day in the @entity173 – a 17 per cent rise since 2007			0
@entity173 trusts translate pamphlets into 120 different languages			0
many public bodies provide translations but the legal obligation to do so is not clear			0
the @entity181 only requires translations if someone is arrested or charged with a crime , while the @entity185 says all parts of the community should have access to services			0
‘ a small minority of @entity23 , @entity192 and @entity193 men think @entity141 women are second - class citizens and white girls are third - class citizens , ’ @entity1 told me			1
when we met last week , she had just arrived back from a whirlwind trip to @entity23 in her role as foreign office minister for the region			1
but we have met to talk about her domestic ministerial role , that of @entity203 and the @entity204			1
in a wide - ranging interview on the eve of a speech on integration , she insisted there was no contradiction between being a devout @entity76 and celebrating @entity211			0
‘ being brought up — before the politically correct brigade got going — on harvest festivals , maypoles , @entity213 plays , @entity211 carols and the @entity215 , made me much more sure about my own identity , ’ she said			0
‘ i did n’t feel it was all watered down to the lowest common denominator			0
’ @entity1 fondly recalled how she and her four sisters persuaded their father , @entity223 , and mother , @entity225 , to celebrate @entity211 – mainly as an excuse to get presents from @entity228			1
‘ our house was small and because @entity231 and @entity232 took out the chimney - breast , like everyone was doing in the @entity235 in those days , we thought @entity228 could n’t come to our house – so my sister left the back door unlocked			0
‘ he still did n’t arrive ! my dad said “ we do n’t do @entity211 , ” so one of my sisters said to him , “ december 25 is the birthday of @entity245 , the founder of @entity23			0
” ’ @entity1 bursts into laughter at the memory			1
‘ we introduced turkey , crackers , hats , a tree and tinsel			0
it became more and more christmassy every year			0
’ did she do turkey with all the trimmings ? ‘ i have spiced turkey ! ’ @entity1 loves @entity211 carols – her favourite is @entity259			1
and while retaining her @entity76 faith , she has continued the @entity211 tradition with her own children , especially 14 - year - old daughter @entity263			1
‘ @entity211 , she just had to be @entity264 , ’ she grins			0
in her first @entity211 as @entity63 chairman , @entity1 was horrified to discover the proposed official chairman ’s card had no mention of @entity269 – so she binned it and replaced it with a ‘ proper traditional card , with @entity271 on it ’			1
she added defiantly : ‘ it took the confidence of a @entity2 muslim to do that			1
’ and she wants other ethnic minorities to follow her lead			0
‘ why not ? white people celebrate @entity281 and @entity282			2
and we all enjoy @entity280			0
’ embracing celebrations : baroness @entity286 's daughter @entity263 , now 14 , celebrating @entity211 aged 4 she is equally determined to make more significant changes to improve integration , including getting rid of classroom assistants used to help children who can not speak @entity152			1
and @entity1 says the proliferation of multilingual forms available for @entity152 speakers at hospitals , welfare offices and elsewhere merely encourages people not to bother to learn @entity152 and hinders their chances of integrating and getting good jobs			1
she takes the same no - nonsense approach to other issues , such as drugs			0
wary of treading on ethnic toes , home secretary @entity302 has not responded to calls to ban the legal plant - based drug khat , which is used mainly by minorities			2
‘ i have been pushing the home secretary to get on with it			0
we can not say , “ because it ’s @entity166 and @entity312 boys who take this , it ’s part of their recreational activity , hey - ho , we will just let them take it			0
” we would not legitimise marijuana to please the @entity319 community , so why do that with khat ? ’ are you listening , @entity322 ? with only six weeks to go before @entity211 , i could not resist asking @entity1 if she had drawn up her @entity211 card list			1
would she be sending one to @entity91 – or @entity98 perhaps ? ‘ i ’ll send him a @entity211 card addressed to the chairman of the @entity63 , ’ she replied			0
and the twinkle in her eye could illuminate an entire christmas tree			0
by @entity331 what @entity1 says is brave , creditable and straightforwardly good			1
her suggestions would be wise whoever made them , but the fact that a @entity76 of @entity141 ancestry has said these things is important and heartening			0
for far too long our official and political classes have , in practice , supported a well - intentioned but disastrous multiculturalism which has encouraged some communities to turn in on themselves			0
no melting pot can function unless it is heated by the warmth of human contact – above all , by a shared language but also , as @entity1 urges , by as much shared culture as possible			1
the idea that @entity351 should celebrate @entity211 is a particularly happy one – as it happens , the birth of @entity353 to the @entity264 is recorded in the @entity354			0
if we were less embarrassed about our own faith and culture , many of our newer citizens might well find it easier , not harder , to fit in .			0
