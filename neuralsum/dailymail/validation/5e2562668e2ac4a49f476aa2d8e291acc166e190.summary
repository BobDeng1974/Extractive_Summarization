a self - made millionaire from @entity1 will put £ 30million of his personal fortune into @entity4 ’s phoenix team , @entity5			1
@entity6 , a 37 - year - old entrepreneur , made that commitment at a press conference			1
with that injection , plus £ 28m in prize money , the team will run on a total budget of £ 58million			2
@entity5 will take part in the opening race of the season in @entity16 on sunday week , subject to their cars passing crash tests			1
briton @entity20 is one of their drivers			0
ovo founder @entity6 ( left ) has joined forces with former @entity25 ceo @entity24 ( right ) @entity5 , who as @entity26 went into administration last october , will be chaired in the interim by @entity24 , former @entity25 ’s chief executive			1
@entity30 , a former @entity32 trader turned founder of energy company @entity34 , revealed he was a @entity4 fan			1
he attended the @entity35 , watching from the outside , ‘ figuring out a way to get over there ’ ( on the inside of the sport )			0
he then spoke to @entity24 about resurrecting the team			1
with stability and sponsorship the initial aims @entity30 joked : ‘ we ’re unlikely to win any races for the first half of the season			0
’ @entity49 's @entity20 has been announced as the renamed @entity41 's first driver for the 2015 season the team , formerly known as @entity26 that went into administration at the end of october and missed the final three races of last season , will continue to be run by sporting director @entity57 and team principal @entity58			1
@entity5 has been preparing their cars at their old base in @entity61 , @entity62 , which comply fully with the 2015 regulations			1
@entity57 claims the cars , which are being crash tested this week , are ' a new concept of car with a very high degree of carry over ( from 2014 ) , with a lot of safety upgrades for 2015 '			0
but the team will definitely be heading to @entity16 for the first race on march 13 - 15 , with the majority of the freight on its way to @entity76 on friday			0
@entity30 , who previously worked as an investment banker at @entity32 , concedes when he first approached @entity57 the team 's cause appeared ' almost hopeless '			0
former team @entity26 will return to @entity4 under the name of @entity5 this season @entity30 added : ' it was one of those situations that needed more time to understand everything , so it seemed too late , with no realistic possibility of reviving the team			1
' but it was ironic that after making it through a hard first five years , claiming ninth in last year 's championship and reaching the first rung of financial stability - if there is such a thing in @entity4 - and then running out of steam , it seemed like too good a story to end there			2
' so i looked to see if there was a way to help this team cling to life , to survival			0
' after speaking to @entity57 , who was very straightforward and we had some frank discussions , there was just one long list of challenges , top of which was to re-establish credibility with the main suppliers , like @entity115			0
' it was a very complex landscape , with a lot of legal and financial challenges , and now in 10 days ' time we will be in @entity16 with a solid business platform on which to operate			0
' for me , @entity24 has been a huge help in navigating the landmines , especially as this is the first company i 've bought			2
' @entity24 has confirmed he is only on board in an interim basis and that he will assist in looking for a full - time chairman before taking on a non-executive directorship			1
@entity24 said : ' i know from the years i spent at @entity25 that with the right people , right values and sheer hard work , you can turn any business around			1
the @entity4 team will enter a @entity134 that will see them emerge from administration ' in @entity57 and @entity58 we have all three and i 'm fully confident we can help @entity5 be competitive at the highest level of racing			1
' @entity57 concedes people will be unaware of the hurdles that have had to be cleared over the past few months in order for the team to be on the brink of racing again when it seemed they would fold			0
@entity57 and @entity58 have moved heaven and earth to ensure the marque would continue in @entity4 , holding numerous negotiations , notably with the long list of creditors owed a combined total of £ 60million			2
it resulted in deals being struck and @entity5 obtaining a @entity154 ( @entity134 ) on february 19 , allowing them to exit administration and press ahead with plans to return to the grid			1
power - unit supplier @entity115 , the main creditor owed £ 16.5m , was one of the key players in @entity5 's ability to acquire the @entity134			2
' the last few months have been a bit of a rollercoaster , ' said @entity57			0
' it 's important to say in getting back to racing we 've had a huge amount of support from the @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 ( @entity173 ) , our suppliers , partners and staff , with many of them back on board			0
' i have to pay particular thanks to @entity6 who has a passion for the sport , but what really struck me is that he also has a passion for business challenges			2
' he is driven by solving problems , and i 've been incredibly impressed by his ability in doing that			0
this team would not have been saved without his input			2
' @entity5 confirmed last week young @entity192 @entity20 as one of their drivers , with the 23 - year - old given a taste of @entity4 in the final race of last season in @entity200 when he drove for @entity201 in their bid to emerge from their own administrative process			1
no announcement has been made yet as to the second driver .			0
