@entity0 insists he has no regrets about returning to become @entity3 coach for the second time even though they face a humiliating early exit from the @entity7 if they lose here on monday against @entity10			1
@entity0 , a county championship winner with both @entity12 and @entity13 , finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after @entity3 's woeful showing at this @entity7			1
they need to defeat both @entity10 at the @entity20 and @entity21 in @entity22 on friday while hoping @entity23 also beat @entity10 to ensure they claim the quarter - final place that should have been comfortable for them			1
@entity3 coach @entity0 talks to the media during a press conference at the @entity20 on sunday @entity0 insists he has no regrets about returning to become @entity3 coach for the second time @entity0 finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level but @entity0 , who often struggles to get his message across in public , cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he can not afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job			1
' no regrets at all , ' insisted @entity0			1
' i came in because i felt i could help make a difference			0
you have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we 've certainly been behind in the one - day format and have to get better			0
' i 've no regrets on taking on that challenge			0
as a coach you have only one focus now and that 's the @entity7			1
it comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment – to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament			0
' i 'm fine because we 've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that 's the most important thing			0
we 're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need			0
' @entity0 first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain @entity63 and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him			1
' @entity70 will tell , ' said @entity0 , who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director @entity73 when he appointed him in the wake of @entity3 's @entity76 debacle here last year			1
' i 'd love to say things change straight - away but they do n't			0
@entity3 coach @entity0 speaks with @entity80 during an @entity3 nets session in @entity82 @entity3 have endured some rotten @entity83 since they went close in 1992 and must beat @entity10 @entity3 know they can not afford a slip - up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face @entity10 ' what we 've seen so far is the emergence of some players who 've had a really good time and others who have found challenges			1
the emergence of @entity94 has been really exciting and @entity95 is starting to grow as a player			0
' individually we 've seen people grow but there 's work to be done with our younger one - day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket			2
that 's a long - term thing			0
' @entity104 match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against @entity106 last summer and identify a new - look line - up			0
there are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we 're in one at the moment with this @entity7			1
mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then			0
' @entity3 will not confirm their team to face a @entity10 team they lost to in the last @entity7 until the toss on monday but @entity0 defended @entity121 and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when @entity3 's session was finished			1
' @entity121 's had a tough time of it but that does n't mean he 's not a really good player , ' said @entity0			1
' we know we 've got a big game and we 've thought about what our best team is			0
we 're pretty clear on what that best xi is now			0
we 'll announce it at the toss			0
' @entity139 of @entity3 takes a catch during an @entity3 nets session at the @entity20 @entity3 's @entity142 takes a catch during an @entity3 nets session on saturday ahead of their next game if @entity147 stays despite a run of four failures since replacing @entity150 on the eve of the @entity7 then it would be confirmation for @entity142 that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his @entity154 form over 50 - overs			1
if @entity142 does not play now then clearly @entity3 do not rate him			1
@entity3 still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in @entity157 but @entity158 appeared to be in the frame today , possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent @entity161			2
or @entity147 if @entity3 decide to play an extra bowler			2
' it looks a good batting pitch and i expect it to be full of runs , ' said @entity0			2
' there 's pressure on us because we have n't played as well as we 'd like to have done and we have to win the game			2
international cricket is about handling that pressure			2
it 's part of the job and that 's the challenge for the players tomorrow			0
we 're up for that			0
' there was also discouragement for his old bête noire @entity63 , who appeared to be handed an @entity3 lifeline by new @entity185 chairman @entity184 last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket			2
' it sounds like what @entity184 said was taken out of context and the policy on the @entity63 situation has been made very clear by @entity73 , ' added @entity0			2
@entity158 ( left ) is held back at the @entity20 as he and his team - mates get prepared @entity3 warm up during a nets session at the @entity20 where they will meet @entity10			1
