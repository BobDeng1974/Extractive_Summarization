by @entity0 federal health regulators will consider this week whether to green light a provocative new fertilization technique that could eventually create babies from the dna of three people , with the goal of preventing mothers from passing on debilitating genetic diseases to their children			1
the @entity11 has framed its two - day meeting as a ' scientific , technologic and clinical ' discussion about how to test the approach in humans			1
but the technique itself raises a number of ethical questions , including whether the government should sanction the creation of genetically modified humans			1
scientists could soon create embryos using dna from three people - a man and two women - to prevent mothers from passing on genetic diseases			1
the @entity32 is starting a public consultation on the rules to gather as many views as possible before introducing its final regulations the experimental technique , if approved for use , would allow a woman to give birth to a baby who inherits her normal nucleus dna but not her defective mitochondrial dna			2
to accomplish this , researchers would remove the nucleus dna from a healthy female donor 's eggs and replace it with the nucleus dna of the prospective mother			0
after fertilization , the resulting child would inherit the mother 's nucleus dna - which contains most inherited traits like eye color and height - but the donor 's healthy mitochondrial dna			0
the @entity11 panel will hear from several prominent critics who oppose any human testing of the approach , arguing that it could be a slippery slope toward ' designer babies , ' - in which parents customize traits like eye color , height and intelligence			1
but the field 's leading @entity73 researcher will be on hand to explain and defend his work , which he describes as ' gene correction , ' rather than ' gene modification			0
' ' we want to replace these mutated genes , which by nature have become pathogenic to humans , ' says dr. @entity83 , who will present on tuesday			2
' we 're reversing them back to normal , so i do n't understand why you would be opposing that			0
' the @entity11 meeting was prompted by @entity83 's research at @entity90 in @entity91 , where he and his staff have produced five healthy monkeys using the dna - replacement technique			1
he is seeking @entity11 approval to begin testing in a handful of women who carry defective genes that can lead to devastating diseases in children , including blindness , organ failure and epilepsy			1
an estimated 1 in 5,000 @entity73 children inherit such conditions because of defective dna in their mitochondria , small energy - producing organs found in the cell			2
unlike most dna - located in the nucleus of the cell - mitochondrial dna is passed along only by the mother , not the father			0
the experimental technique , if approved for use , would allow a woman to give birth to a baby who inherits her normal nucleus dna but not her defective mitochondrial dna			2
to accomplish this , researchers would remove the nucleus dna from a healthy female donor 's eggs and replace it with the nucleus dna of the prospective mother			0
after fertilization , the resulting child would inherit the mother 's nucleus dna - which contains most inherited traits like eye color and height - but the donor 's healthy mitochondrial dna			0
this graphic explains the science behind the technique which has been slammed by critics for being a breach of medical ethics the technique initially made headlines as a way to create babies with three parents , but scientists say that 's an overstatement , since the child would have only trace bits of dna from the donor			1
no matter how it 's described , the technique faces opposition from a broad spectrum of critics who say it presents serious medical , ethical and societal dilemmas			1
chief among these concerns is that the genetic changes created using the technique would be passed down to future generations , potentially spreading unintended health consequences throughout the population			1
in a letter to the @entity11 , the @entity163 points out that more than 40 countries - including @entity165 and @entity166 - have laws banning human gene modification that is passed on to future offspring			1
the group 's director says mitochondrial replacement would help only a tiny fraction of patients affected by such disorders , and they have other options like egg donation to create healthy children			2
' it does initially look like something you would want to support , ' said @entity182			0
' but the safety concerns and the social and ethical concerns are really overriding			0
' still , many experts expect the @entity11 to eventually sign off on testing the technique			1
they note that regulators in the @entity189 found broad public support for the research there , with no evidence that it would endanger mothers or their children			2

the techniques under discussion involve removing the nucleus dna from a healthy female donor 's eggs and replacing it with the nucleus dna of the prospective mother , either before or after fertilisation the @entity189 has significantly more regulations surrounding in vitro fertilization than the @entity73 , where fertilization clinics are essentially a self - regulated industry			0
and before the @entity11 considers the philosophical implications of genetically modified children , its first concern is the safety of any patients enrolled in experiments			1
in documents posted ahead of this week 's meeting , the agency said it will seek public input on how to monitor the safety of women who undergo the fertilization process			0
the agency also wants to hear proposals for long - term follow - up of any children produced via the process			0
@entity230 professor @entity229 says the @entity11 is taking the right approach by focusing on the immediate safety concerns , rather than speculating on whether this could lead to a ' @entity234 ' scenario of biologically engineered humans			1
' we constantly live on slippery slopes and it 's our job as moral humans to hold a good position on the slope , ' said @entity229 , a law professor who studies medical ethics			0
' if you 're worried about genetically engineered monsters or superheroes then you try to stop that , you do n't try to stop medically useful interventions because you 're worried that 17 steps down the line it will turn into something we do n't like			0

two day @entity11 meeting will examine scientific and technical issues of testing the technique in humans
critics claim move approval could be first step towards designer babies
