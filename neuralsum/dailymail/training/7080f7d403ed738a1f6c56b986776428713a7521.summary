think you can keep a straight face while watching your favourite comedian ? a comedy club in @entity4 is betting you ca n't , and it is even basing its ticket prices on how often it can make you laugh			1
@entity6 has installed facial - recognition technology on the back of its chairs to track how much each person in their theatre has enjoyed the show			1
the system was dreamt up by @entity4 - based advertising agency @entity25 , after @entity27 asked them to think up a way to increase ticket sales			1
a number of people have tried , and reportedly failed , to sit through a comedy show without laughing in an attempt to get a free ticket			1
using the novel system , the average ticket price per person has so far been € 6 ( £ 4.70 or $ 7.58 )			1
funny money : one laugh will cost you € 0.30 ( 24p or 38 cents ) , and customers have a maximum charge of € 24 ( £ 18 or $ 30 )			1

it is unclear which facial recognition software is being used , but most use algorithms to track facial landmarks on a subject 's face			0
for instance , an algorithm can analyse the position , size or shape of the mouth to determine whether a person is laughing , smiling or sad			2
the comedy club has also launched a mobile app as a method of payment and a pay - per - laugh season ticket			2
@entity72 , director of @entity74 's @entity73 , told the @entity75 : ' sounds fun , just so long as all the facial recognition data does n't get forwarded to the @entity78 [ @entity78 ]			0
' it 'd be a big technical challenge - as people laugh so often at the 99 we 'd have to install a cash machine by every seat			2
' next time your boss tells a bad joke and you feel compelled to laugh , beware - they can tell you 're faking it			2
researchers from @entity74 have discovered our brains carry out different process when we hear genuine laughter compared to fake chuckles			0
when laughter is forced , for example , it activates a part of the brain linked with deciphering emotions			0
this means we know it 's not a genuine laugh , and we automatically try to work out why they 're faking it , what the laugh means and what the they 're thinking			2
while genuine laughter lights up areas of the brain linked with happiness and positive emotions			0
to test the theory , psychologist dr @entity115 from the @entity116 measured brain responses of volunteers as they listened to genuine laughter on @entity120 clips			0
each participant was asked to pick clips they found @entity124 ranged from comedy shows , such as @entity126 , and even the @entity127			0
the results were then compared to how their brains responded to fake laughter			0
the findings revealed participants , none of which were told the study was about laughter perception , could unconsciously tell when the chuckles were insincere			0
