by @entity0 published : 04:10 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 04:43 est , 10 august 2013 wine - makers in @entity2 are facing ruin after hail storms decimated vineyards in @entity6 just a few weeks after summer storms destroyed up to 90 per cent of crops in @entity9			1
the torrential hail storm which struck on august 2 ravaged around 20,000 hectares of land in the region - leaving many vineyards completely barren			1
many wine - makers in the region have been left with no crops by freak hail the size of ' pigeon 's eggs ' while others have seen theirs severely reduced			1
devastated : many wine - makers are facing ruin after hailstorms destroyed much of the crops last weekend ( stock image ) now two of @entity2 's best - known wine - producing regions , @entity6 and @entity9 , will have limited output in the next two years causing many to lose their livelihoods and a hike in price for bottles of wine that are produced			1
@entity38 , who owns 30 hectares at the @entity39 near the village of @entity41 , between the @entity36 and @entity37 rivers south - east of @entity6 , told the @entity42 : ' it 's a catastrophe			1
everything has gone : the leaves , the grapes , everything			0
a year 's work gone in nine minutes of hail			2
' the storm was so violent the hailstones wounded the wood			0
the outer skin is shredded			0
there wo n't be a single bottle from these vines this year			0
' we have been hit by hail six times in the last 25 years , but never like this			2
we had just finished trimming the vines and getting rid of the weeds – without herbicides – ready for the harvest in september			0
we had high hopes of this harvest			0
' it comes after the majority of vineyards were wrecked by rain storms in @entity9 , where some of the country 's best wines are produced , at the end of july			1
damaged crop : the @entity9 village of @entity75 , pictured , was one of many wine - growing villages affected in the @entity80 region which stretches over 12 miles ruined : vineyards which were left seriously damaged after a summer hailstorm in @entity9 the damage caused by the ‘ catastrophic ’ weather is threatening both the 2013 and 2014 vintages of the exclusive wine			1
growers are still assessing the impact of the storms on the vines , but the @entity91 ( @entity92 ) said the @entity94 and @entity95 areas - prized for their well - known and crus - were the worst hit			2
‘ it is awful to see these vines ripped by hail and several years of wine growers ’ work destroyed by the weather in one afternoon , ’ @entity98 , head of @entity2 ’s independent wine makers said			2
‘ damage will be severe , which means that the 2013 vintage due to come out in 2015 - 2016 will become much rarer , ’ he said			2
bad for business : burgundy wine supplies will be hit for the coming vintage , meaning that the price will have to increase because of the scarcity premier cru : @entity9 is home to some of @entity2 's most expensive and respected wines , which are now in jeopardy many wine - makers were still trying to recover from damage caused by hail last year and from floods this spring			1
some are using extreme methods to try and protect their crops from future weather - related catastrophe			0
one technique being used is cannons which fire silver iodide into the atmosphere which dissolves hailstones so they turn into rain			0
but a lot of iodide is needed for it to be effective and advanced warning ahead of a storm so it can be released in time			0
another option is placing netting high above the vines to catch the hailstones before they can damage the plants but many wine - makers found the hailstones just eventually broke the nets and landed on the vines anyway			1
many argue that insurance is the only viable option - but with some areas seeing six devastating hailstorms in the last 12 years , it is becoming increasingly costly .			0

severe hailstorms hit the @entity6 region on august 2 completely destroying entire vineyards
vineyards owners described the hail as being the size of ' pigeon 's eggs '
comes weeks after much of @entity9 's wine crop was destroyed by storms
many wine - makers are now facing ruin as they have no grapes to make wine
