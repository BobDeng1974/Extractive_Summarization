by @entity0 the sad beauty of these incredible images cast a light on the shipbreaking industry in @entity5 , where workers face death and injury from accidents and environmental hazards for just a few dollars a a day			1
@entity11 is the largest of its type in the world			2
around 80 active ship breaking yards line an eight - mile stretch of the coast , employing more than 200,000 @entity5 and accounting for half of all the steel in @entity5			1
ship breaking is the dismantling of ships for scrap recycling			2
most ships have a lifespan of a 25 - 30 years before there is so much wear that repair becomes uneconomical , but the rising cost to insure and maintain aging vessels can make even younger vessels unprofitable to operate			1
these are hauled off the beach by teams of loaders , then melted down			2
ship breaking allows materials from the ship , especially steel , to be recycled			0
equipment , fuel and chemicals on board the vessel can also be reused			0
@entity64 , writing for @entity66 , visited the region to see it first hand			0
he described the guards , razor wire - topped fences and signs prohibiting photography there , installed following scrutiny in the ship breaker 's operations after a spate of deaths			1
after workers spent several days cutting through the decks of the @entity83 , a large section suddenly crashes , sending shards of steel flying toward the yard managers			1
built in @entity88 , @entity89 , the cargo vessel was at sea for 30 years , about the average ship 's life span he said : ' in the sprawling shantytowns that have grown up around the yards , i met dozens of the workers			1
many had deep , jagged scars			0
" @entity35 tattoos , " one man called them			0
' some men were missing fingers			0
a few were blind in one eye			0
' in one home i meet a family whose four sons worked in the yards			1
the oldest , @entity109 , 40 , spent two weeks as a cutter 's helper before witnessing a man burn to death when his torch sparked a pocket of gas belowdecks			0
' " i did n't even collect my pay for fear they would n't let me leave , " he says , explaining that bosses often intimidate workers to keep silent about accidents			2
' fishermen place their nets at low tide in front of the ship - breaking yards in @entity35 , @entity5			1
today @entity35 is partially soaked with oil and toxic mud			0
file picture ship breaking is dangerous work and can expose workers to toxic chemicals			1
file picture the work is back - breaking because these massive ships are not designed to come apart , but withstand some of the harshest conditions imaginable at sea			2
they are often constructed with toxic materials , such as asbestos and lead			0
when ships are scrapped in the developed world , the process is more strictly regulated and expensive , so the bulk of the world 's shipbreaking is done in @entity5 , @entity149 , and @entity150 , where labour is cheap and oversight is minimal			1
the article about the ship breakers of @entity35 appears in the may issue of @entity66			0
right , a worker in a ship - breaking yard in @entity35			2

arduous and dangerous job employs 200,000 @entity5 and is notorious for injuries to and deaths of workers
there are around 80 yards along an eight - mile stretch of the coast of @entity5
