@entity0 has acknowledged that the propulsion unit on one of the rockets responsible for the deadly @entity5 chemical attack indicates it was made by a @entity7 plant in @entity8			1
but @entity10 experts claim the remnants of the ‘ antique ’ weapon provide new evidence the sarin blast was the work of rebels and not the @entity18 regime			1
president @entity20 ’s military machine would not have used this ‘ ancient junk ’ for a chemical attack when they have far more up to date missiles , said one			2
mourning : a @entity5 man grieves over a dead body after the 21 august attack which prompted @entity5 agreeing to lose its arsenal the first missile was ‘ a 140 - mm m - 14 - series rocket projectile from an old @entity7 - made @entity33 multiple - launch system dating from 1952 , ’ said @entity34 , director of @entity0 ’s @entity35			1
the numbering and @entity38 letters show it is from @entity41 plant in @entity42 , which during the @entity43 was ‘ one of the @entity7 ’s main producers of various types of unguided rocket projectiles			0
‘ the code 4 - 67 - 179 means the 4th batch in 1967 by factory 179 , ’ he said			0
@entity34 claimed it was ‘ unlikely ’ the @entity7 had sold chemical weapons to @entity5 but said that in any case ‘ an old munition has clearly been improvised to take chemicals			2
‘ we know that the @entity5 took the @entity58 out of service long ago and m - 14 - series projectiles for that weapon are long past their storage deadlines			0
’ ' given proof ' : @entity5 president @entity20 , right , meets @entity65 in @entity18 today , where the @entity0 deputy foreign minister said @entity5 told his officials they have handed over proof of ' rebels participating in the chemical attack ' the @entity0 expert said : ‘ if they wanted to use chemical munitions then they probably would not have wanted to risk it with antiques like these and instead would have gone for the @entity78 , for which they probably do have chemical munitions			1
‘ but the insurgents could have found this ancient junk after capturing some military storage depot			0
’ the second projectile identified by weapons inspectors looked to be ‘ home made ’			0
blaming the @entity20 opposition for the attack , he claimed : ‘ the @entity5 army is unlikely to be making and using such primitive munitions			1
’ meanwhile , @entity0 claimed today it was handed new materials by the @entity5 regime implicating rebels in the chemical attack outside @entity18 on august 21			1
deputy foreign minister @entity65 , said after meeting top officials in @entity18 : ‘ the corresponding materials were handed to the @entity0 side			0
we were told that they were evidence that the rebels are implicated in the chemical attack			0
’ he said that @entity0 would ‘ examine the @entity5 materials implicating the rebels with the utmost seriousness			1
’ @entity0 has repeatedly expressed suspicion that the chemical attack was a ‘ provocation ’ staged by the rebels with the aim of attracting @entity111 military intervention in the conflict			2
mr @entity65 also claimed this week ’s @entity114 report into the chemical attack was ‘ politicised , biased and one - sided ’ .			0

@entity10 says parts of chemical **gas** rockets were made in @entity8
@entity0 *sources* say they hail from the 1960s - and are ' too old ' for @entity20
they claim this proves @entity5 rebels fired sarin **gas** on *civilians*
