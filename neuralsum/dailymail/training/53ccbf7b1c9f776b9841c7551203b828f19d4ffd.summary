@entity2 , who describes herself as ' half - @entity15 , half @entity16 ' , was on board a plane between @entity3 and @entity5 on sunday when she was arrested along with two other passengers after a security scare			1
but she was completely unaware she had been singled out , along with two @entity22 men sitting in her row - none of whom knew each other - before an armed swat team stormed on to the plane			1
at the time , she had just sent a tweet on her mobile phone saying ' ( c ) ops in uniform and plainclothes huddle in rear of plane '			0
another passenger had reported the two men as being ' suspicious ' , apparently after they got up to go to the bathroom in succession			1
mrs @entity2 said : ' someone shouted for us to place our hands on the seats in front of us , heads down			2
' the cops ran down the aisle , stopped at my row and yelled at us to get up			0
' one of the cops , grabbing my arm a little harder than i would have liked			0
he slapped metal cuffs on my wrists and pushed me off the plane			0
' the three of us , two @entity22 men living in the @entity5 metro area , and me , a half - @entity15 , half - @entity16 housewife living in suburban @entity57 , were being detained			1
' in shock , she was held in small cell , strip - searched and then questioned by @entity62 agents			1

high alert : a heavily armed police officer stands guard on @entity95 , @entity96 , during the 9/11 memorial on sunday ' i asked what was going on , and the man said judging from their line of questioning that i could probably guess , but that someone on the plane had reported that the three of us in row 12 were conducting suspicious activity			1
' what is the likelihood that two @entity22 men who did n't know each other and a dark - skinned woman of @entity15 / @entity16 heritage would be on the same flight from @entity3 to @entity5 ? was that suspicion enough ? ' even considering that we did n't say a word to each other until it became clear there were cops following our plane ? ' mrs @entity2 was later released without charge , along with the two men			1
but initial media reports claimed she and one of the other passengers had been ' making out ' during the flight			0

' due to the anniversary of sept. 11 , all precautions were taken , and any slight inconsistency was taken seriously , ms @entity140 said			0
' the public would rather us err on the side of caution than not			0
