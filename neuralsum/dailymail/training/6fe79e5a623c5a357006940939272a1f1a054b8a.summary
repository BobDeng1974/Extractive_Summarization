he was taken ill overnight and died at @entity12 @entity37 is a powerful general anaesthetic that can cause the sensation of a near - death experience , but deaths linked to the substance are rare			1
legally used for operations on humans and animals , it gives recreational users a ' floaty ' feeling but can also lead to a bad trip known as the ' k - hole '			2
costing around £ 20 a gram on the street , it can be addictive and includes among its effects paralysis of the muscles , loss of feeling in the body and a distorted sense of reality			0
it can also cause hallucinations , agitation , panic attacks and impairment in short and long - term memory , and frequent use has been associated with depression			2
the drug was regraded from a class c to a more serious class b controlled drug earlier this month amid growing concern over its impact on the health of long - term users			2
physical damage from long - term use includes serious bladder problems , with some heavy users even having to get their bladders surgically removed			2
a spokesman said : ' the family of the man had been informed of his condition yesterday			0
his death is not considered suspicious			0
' at this stage we believe this was an individual reaction to ketamine and was not from a bad batch of the drug			1

as steady rain fell on the site , many appeared reluctant to leave the relative comfort of their tents , while others tentatively ventured out in wellies and anoraks to see just how much mud they might have to contend with			0
although the rain - expected to continue throughout the day - was not welcome to many , stall holders charging £ 15 a time for wellies and waterproofs were enjoying a roaring trade			0
also performing on the @entity4 later today will be @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , while acts on other stages include @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
