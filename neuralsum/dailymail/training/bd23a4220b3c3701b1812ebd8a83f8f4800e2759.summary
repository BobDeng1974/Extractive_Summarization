by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 18:14 est , 28 april 2013 a police box in @entity3 's @entity2 : they were phased out in 1960s these days , it ’s more commonly known as @entity7 ’s time - travelling spaceship , the @entity9			1
but the blue police box could be set for a return to @entity13 ’s streets			1
an influential think - tank has called for police forces to bring back the boxes , which were phased out in the 1960s			1
in a major report , @entity18 called for the return of the blue boxes to save money and improve the service to the public			1
it concludes that police stations , though popular with the public , are ‘ out of date ’ and should be replaced by both boxes and counters in shopping centres , post offices and elsewhere on the high street			1
the report endorses the ‘ possible introduction of a modern version of the @entity9 police box , made famous by @entity7 ’			1
it adds : ‘ these would be technologically - enabled police contact points , featuring two - way audio - visual technology so the public could communicate directly with police			2
’ the boxes were commonplace from the 1920s to the 1960s , before the introduction of police radios			1
beat officers would be based around a box , which contained a phone			2
a light on top of the box would flash to indicate to the officer they should contact the station			2
modern versions would allow the public to report crime and anti-social behaviour , get information and even give witness statements , the report said			0
crucially , they would allow the members of the public to contact officers even when their local police station had closed			2
forces across @entity69 and @entity70 have closed hundreds of counters at stations in recent years in an effort to save millions of pounds			1
the boxes could operate as a base for neighbourhood beat officers , the report said			2
its author , professor @entity78 , director of the @entity79 at @entity80 , added : ‘ there has been uproar whenever chief constables or @entity86 suggest they might want to close some stations			0
‘ however the truth is most crime is reported by phone , many stations are getting old and increasingly expensive to maintain and are often located in the wrong places , away from key population centres			1
‘ it might be more productive to engage local people in conversations about replacing out - dated stations with more local offices			0
’ the blue police box is more commonly known as the time - travel machine in @entity7 , starring @entity101 and @entity102 the report said that use of police station front counters was in decline			1
in @entity108 some have fewer than seven visitors a day			0
the number of people reporting crimes at counters has fallen by more than 100,000 in six years			0
about one in five of those who visit a station is asking about lost property , while one in ten is asking for information such as directions			0
last year it was revealed chief constables will close 264 public counters over the next three years			0
the @entity122 and other forces have announced they will put counters in supermarkets and elsewhere to try and stay in touch with the public			0
the report said saving money on buildings is better than cutting the number of officers available			0
of the ‘ @entity9 ’ boxes , it adds : ‘ they could be used to report crime , provide witness statements , discuss concerns and priorities and access information			0

@entity18 says police stations are out of date and should be replaced
it suggests police boxes and counters in shopping centres and post office
the box was phased out in the 1960s when police radios were introduced
