by @entity0 last updated at 8:21 pm on 8th december 2011 top scientists are designing a self - controlled navigation system that will pilot the next @entity3 - an artificially intelligent ' sat nav ' that will drive the hi - tech vehicle			1
except , of course , on @entity6 , there are no gps satellites to guide it - so it will be smart enough to do the whole thing itself			1
it should speed up the vehicle immensely - sending a radio signal to @entity6 to control a vehicle takes more than half an hour			1
independent : the new navigation system will allow a @entity3 to find its way around the @entity6 all by itself since the ' seeker ' navigation system will save so much time , it will allow a rover to find its way around the @entity25 - covering at least one kilometre a day			1
the system will perform a range of key actions completely unaided by @entity29 or gps - type technology including : working out the precise location of the rover on @entity6 , identifying particular sites to visit on the planet and detecting and avoiding hazards			1
it will also be able to navigate its way back to previously visited sites			2
it will take the team of experts from @entity43 , @entity44 , and @entity45 seven months to complete the project , which is part of the @entity47 ’s ( @entity47 ’s ) @entity49 initiative , which tackles space - related challenges			1
early developments of the system were unveiled by the team based at the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) in @entity55 at @entity54 's 7th @entity57 conference today			0
the event organised by @entity59 sees leading experts from across the globe sharing the very latest developments in current and future space exploration			0
self - controlled : the system will be able to identify specific sites to visit and detect hazards project director , @entity67 of @entity59 said : ' the keys to @entity21 ’s success will be imagination , application and team work			2
' with radio signals to conventional rovers taking at least 30 minutes to travel between @entity77 and @entity6 , @entity21 ’s ability to work autonomously in hostile terrain will be crucial to extending our understanding of our planetary neighbour			0
' @entity81 , minister of state for universities and science , said : ' space captures the imagination of so many people , and it ’s excellent to see @entity43 experts playing such a significant role in the groundbreaking @entity49 initiative			0
' @entity91 project has the potential to transform our exploration of @entity6 and make an important contribution to the international body of knowledge on the universe around us			0
' the seeker team includes experts from @entity54 's @entity102 , it developer @entity103 , global defence and security company @entity105 , and electronics engineering company @entity107 - all in @entity43			2
scientists from @entity109 , the leading research unit specialising in information science and technologies in @entity44 and @entity112 in @entity45 also form part of the team .			0

vehicle will be able to find its way around the @entity25 - covering at least one km in a day
