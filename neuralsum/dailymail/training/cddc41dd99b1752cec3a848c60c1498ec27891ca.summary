@entity0 has reportedly suspended all filming in the wake of a devastating hacker attack that has crippled the company 's ability to make payments			1
the entertainment giant is allegedly unable to make transactions , or make any use of a huge number of computers , after a hacking cell linked to @entity13 disabled its security measures and stole valuable information			1
as well as disabling key elements of their network , hackers also took and leaked a trove of embarrassing e-mails , which revealed the a top executive made a racist jibe at @entity24 , insulted @entity25 , and tinkered with the storyline of a film about @entity13			1
pictured is @entity35 ceo @entity34 a source told the @entity37 that the company ca n't process any payments , which has in turn led third parties to cancel shoots			1
the scale of the suspension was not immediately clear			0
@entity45 has contacted @entity0 for comment			2
the revelation on friday is the latest in a damaging chain of revelations linked to the action , seemingly with the aim of preventing the release of @entity53 , a film in which @entity13 dictator @entity54 is assassinated			1
in emails that were leaked on thursday , @entity35 chief executive officer @entity34 wrote to @entity57 asking that scenes from the movie featuring @entity54 be removed or edited			1
@entity60 then shared the information with the film 's star , writer and director , @entity62 , who was none too happy			1
not happy : @entity62 ( above ) , who wrote , directed and starred in the film @entity53 was asked to change key scenes supreme leader : the interview tells the story of two men sent to @entity13 to try and kill @entity54 ( above ) ' this is now a story of @entity73 changing their movie to make @entity13 happy , ' wrote @entity62 in an email to @entity60 obtained by @entity76			1
' that is a very damning story			0
' @entity60 tried to explain herself to @entity62 , saying ; ' as embarrassing as this has been from my point of view , you have to appreciate the fact that we have n't just dictated to you what it had to be			2
' she then adds , ' this is n't some flunky			0
it 's the chairman of the entire @entity35 who i am dealing ( with )			0
' in another email she cites the proximity of @entity13 to @entity96 as another reason changes might be necessary			2
' i have n’t the foggiest notion how to deal with @entity96 politics as it relates to @entity13 so all i can do is make sure that @entity0 wo n’t be put in a bad situation and even that is subjective , ' she tells @entity62			1
@entity62 agrees to make the changes , though @entity60 does put in an email to @entity34 that there was some ' resistance from the filmmakers			2
' the changes , which have to do with a major plot point , seem to take some time to deal with , and @entity62 completes the task to @entity34 's liking it would seem by october , writing in his final email , ' please tell us this is over now			0
' and while he may have been annoyed and angered , @entity62 is still very much a fan of @entity60 , praising her thursday evening at the premiere of the film			1
' we want to thank @entity57 for having the balls to make this movie , ' said @entity62			0
ironically , however , the film is not set to open in @entity122			0
her again : @entity0 head @entity57 ( above ) was tasked with telling @entity62 he had to make changes the changes are also described in the emails , though they spoil the film , which is set to open on december 25			1
this is just the latest email leak from a group calling themselves @entity131 , who , as previously mentioned , want to stop the release of @entity53			0
@entity60 said in an interview thursday that every employee 's email from the past 10 years was obtained in the hack , meaning these leaks could go on for weeks or even months			0
it is believed that a group from @entity13 is behind the hack			0
the scenes that were changed are detailed in the emails , and show what an amusing and out there film @entity53 will be warning : spoilers ! in one email , @entity60 writes to @entity148 : ' in shot # 337 there is no face melting , less fire in the hair , fewer embers on the face , and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire , as well as darkened to look less like flesh			0
' she then adds , ' we arrived at this shot ( # 337 ) after much cajoling and resistance from the filmmakers			0
' in another email , @entity164 , president of @entity0 motion picture group , wrote to @entity60 : ' in the interest of getting this approved , i would still like to see them eliminate the tendril of flesh on the left side of his forehead that comes just before the fireball			2
' @entity148 also requested that the scene where @entity54 's head explodes not be shown in any versions of the film outside the @entity73 .			2
