by @entity0 @entity2 's boyhood home is set to open its doors to the public on august 16 , attracting up to 50,000 tourists a year			1
music aficionados already flock to the @entity8 area of @entity9 to commemorate the @entity2 's death - even though there are few restaurants or country music dives to quench the thirst with a legal beer			1
now as part of a £ 3.3million project , the musician 's simple clapboard home will welcome fans and give a glimpse into the star 's childhood , which was spent with his family cultivating a small plot of land			1
cash 's modest five bedroom family home is soon to open for tours - expecting 30,000 - 50,000 visitors annually the five - room farmhouse has been restored to look just as it did , with new furniture conjured up from old photographs and diaries			1
the new tours are expected to boost tourism in the area , bringing in around £ 6million to the local economy			1
' so , that , for @entity9 , is quite significant ' said @entity40 , head of @entity43 's @entity42 program and at the helm of the project			0
hidden away at the eastern edge of the state , the small town of @entity8 is where @entity2 spent most of his formative years until he joined the @entity50 in 1950			2
now , there are high hopes that the little farmstead – which sits at the end of a dirt track on the edge of town , at 4791 @entity58 – can become as famous a tourist site as the onetime address of another @entity62 musical legend , @entity61			1
@entity61 ’s flamboyant @entity64 mansion sits just 50 miles from @entity8 , across the @entity65 and the @entity67 state line , in @entity68			1
it attracts 600,000 visitors every year – and tourism officials in @entity9 are optimistic that the cash family homestead can share in some of the passing trade			2
the @entity75 's desolation inspired many of @entity2 's songs such as ' @entity78 ' about the 1937 flood the ambitious restoration goes beyond providing a glimpse into the childhood of a musical sensation , providing also an idea of how a typical colony family lived at that time			1
the cash family , with three - year - old @entity2 in tow , moved to @entity8 in 1935 as part of an experiment in which five hundred families were selected to settle in modest houses and cultivate 20 - 40 acres of swamp and forest			1
' you came and you worked the land			0
when the land became productive and you began to make some money off it , then you paid the government back with the idea of eventually owning your own land ' @entity40 told @entity101			0
cash 's eldest daughter , the writer @entity102 says of the poor @entity2 family : ' i do n't think they would have survived without the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) project			2
there were 500 cottages , the administration building where my grandpa sold the cotton he picked and the co-op , the movie theater , the cafe and the school			0
' the @entity118 : @entity2 and wife , singer @entity119 , in @entity121 in 1968 the museum will educate about a significant part of @entity124 , illuminating the origin of some of @entity2 's heartfelt songs like ' @entity78 ' about the catastrophic 1937 flood and ' @entity129 ' on the back - breaking cotton picking process in @entity8			1
the eagerly anticipated opening follows in the wake of the fourth annual @entity134 with headliners @entity135 , @entity137 and @entity138 - initially started as a fundraiser for the project			0
transforming the colony 's theatre , now just a shell , into a tourist orientation centre , and building a caretaker home are intended as later phases to the venture			2
family , community and helping others in times of hardship and need are recurring themes in @entity2 's lifelong body of work - highlighting principles which are still important in the @entity75 today			2
what must have been a memorable jamming session ! cash joins @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity61 the project is hoping to raise the fortunes of the @entity8 , where money is still scarce and much of the village has fallen into decline , with agriculture and numbers dwindling			1
the @entity75 's desolation , however , does appear to have contributed greatly to the music of @entity2 , @entity172 and @entity173 - spurring them on to find a way out of the heat and the hard work and proving perhaps that necessity is the mother of all invention			2
a new museum dedicated to the life of @entity2 is set to open in @entity182 later this year			0
the new museum will be situated on @entity182 's main strip , @entity185 , ' right in the middle of the hubbub , ' explained @entity2 's son @entity188			0
@entity102 said of @entity189 , the collector of @entity2 memorabilia who is behind the project : ' he 's been an incredible supporter of my dad and one of the largest collectors of memorabilia			0
' ' if anybody has the whole structure to put up a museum , he does			0
so i have a lot of trust in him and i think it 's great at this point			0
i think he 'll do something with dignity and class that 's historically important , not some kitschy thing			0
i 'm very interested in seeing what he does			0
