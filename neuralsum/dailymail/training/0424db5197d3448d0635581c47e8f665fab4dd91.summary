the first memories are cherished ones			2
for me , it is @entity6 vs @entity7 in 1965 , the all - red strip against the all whites			2
the goal - scorers stand out as iconic names : @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12			2
i ’ll never forget that diving header of @entity12 to win the @entity14			1
i would have been seven years old and after the game i was running about in the garden with my friends practising diving headers			0
then there was @entity21 and @entity22 scoring for @entity23 against @entity24 in 1967 , the first time my team had made the final			1
watching the team you supported winning a @entity14 for the first time was amazingly exciting			1
first @entity14 finals are like first loves ; you never forget them			1
sometimes we need reminding just how important the @entity14 is to our national game			1
on saturday though , @entity34 and @entity35 did the job for us , as did @entity37 on friday night			1
it is turning into one of the best weekends for the @entity14 for years , which everyone who understands @entity42 football will relish			1
@entity45 ' ( front ) goal gave @entity47 side @entity46 a 4 - 2 lead in injury time against @entity24 on saturday @entity45 ( centre below ) celebrates scoring the fourth goal as his @entity46 team - mates enjoy the moment @entity35 players celebrate with their travelling supporters after beating @entity56 2 - 0 @entity37 players celebrate after holding @entity58 to a 0 - 0 draw in the @entity14 on friday night it has had such an pivotal role in our game			1
over my childhood years , the finals are imprinted on my mind			0
the incredible physicality of that @entity7 vs @entity24 final in 1970 , the night - time replay at @entity71 , the long throw and @entity74 ’s goal ; @entity76 ’s celebration in 1971 ; @entity77 ’s save in 1973 — ‘ better than @entity80 , ’ according to my uncle , who himself had been a schoolboy keeper on @entity23 ’s books			1
@entity14 final day was like a bank holiday			1
in my house , it meant a big family gathering with friends , uncles , aunts and cousins coming round to watch the game			2
as a child , the excitement would grow throughout the week			0
it was like waiting for @entity92			0
of course , it had a lot to do with the novelty of the game being on television			0
that in itself was a cause of excitement			0
in that week in may there was suddenly a glut of games on live television : the @entity14 final , @entity42 vs @entity107 a week later and maybe a @entity109 final , if an @entity42 team had made it			1
it ’s hard to believe those used to be perhaps the only live games of the season , other than the odd @entity42 match			0
i would n’t want to swap what we had then for the comprehensive tv coverage we have now			0
but it is clear that the rarity of televised football in those days magnified the importance of the @entity14			1
that will never return and the fact that the @entity127 is financially a much greater priority is not going to change			1
the kind of hype which was once reserved for the @entity14 final is now a week - by - week occurrence in @entity127 games			1
i do n’t believe there ’s one magical reform which could restore the allure of the @entity14			1
@entity137 ( centre ) and @entity139 ( right ) parade the @entity14 after @entity24 's 2 - 1 replay win vs @entity7 in 1970 @entity142 is a commercial business and the success of the @entity127 was evident last week with the release of the list of richest clubs in @entity148 — all 20 of the @entity127 clubs from last season are in the top 40			1
that demonstrates how strong the domestic product is and the tv money they can command			0
however , there is a need for a little balance from managers and players			0
in my day , winning the @entity14 was on a par with winning the league			1
many fans , players , managers and even chairmen would prefer a glory day at @entity167 to winning the league			0
i was lucky enough to play in four and win two finals			0
i remember my first against @entity56 in 1981			1
i was a bit frustrated that i was missing all the build up on the tv , because that had been such a part of my life			0
and when i walked out on to the pitch a couple of hours before kick - off , i was hoping that i was one of the players selected for an interview			2
i ’d watched that day , that build - up and the pre-match interviews so many times as a kid , i just wanted to be a part of it			2
fortunately , @entity187 , who worked for the @entity188 , picked me out			0
that was one of the iconic finals , with @entity193 ’s amazing goal in the replay , having played so badly in the first game			0
when he set off on that famous run , we were all desperate for him to just hit it early , before he lost the ball			2
fortunately he ignored us all and created one of the @entity14 ’s great moments			1
these days you can not expect the same kind of feelings from players			0
the @entity14 had become just one hyped game among the hundreds shown on tv			1
players who are 20 or 25 now wo n’t have the same fond memories i had			0
@entity23 's @entity193 ( centre ) celebrates after scoring the winning goal in the 1980/81 @entity14 final @entity215 ( left ) and @entity216 celebrate as @entity23 defend the @entity14 the following 1981/82 season but they would do well to reflect on the fact that @entity220 is still remembered all around the world for that moment			1
you can remind players that when they look back on their career , it ’s the @entity14 finals they will want to tell their grandchildren about — not finishing sixth in the @entity127			1
having managed , i understand how difficult it is to balance a squad when the @entity127 is your first objective			1
but equally , as a manager , the pinnacle is to win a trophy			0
clearly your job prospects depend on how you do in the league , but for yourself and your own career , winning a cup will be hard to better			0
they are the ones who are usually keener on their club taking the @entity14 more seriously than anyone else			2
@entity246 have sunk right down to @entity247 and endure a horrendous time financially over recent years			0
but speak to most @entity246 fans and the moments they remember , the stories they tell again and again will be about the day they won the @entity14 in 2008 with @entity254			2
you can not make the @entity14 what it was			2
television habits , culture , society and football have all moved on			0
but you ignore it at your peril			0
football is about glory , excitement and winning			0
the money came to football because of the romance , not the other way around			0
people who do n’t understand how important the @entity14 is in creating that romance do n’t really understand what @entity42 football is about			2
@entity246 boss @entity254 ( left ) and captain @entity274 celebrate winning the @entity14 in 2008			2

@entity24 lost 4 - 2 at home to @entity46 in the @entity14
@entity127 holders @entity56 lost 2 - 0 against @entity35
@entity58 drew 0 - 0 at @entity37 in the fourth round
