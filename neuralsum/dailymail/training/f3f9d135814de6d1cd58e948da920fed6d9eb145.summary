criticism : @entity1 was scathing in his summary of @entity4 states a leading @entity4 mandarin said @entity6 is a ' hobbled ' prime minister in a speech in which he blasted the state of the continent and declared : ' @entity10 is ripe for an overhaul			1
' @entity1 singled out @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 as ' essentially ungovernable ' and derided eurosceptic mps in the @entity17 parliament as ' unspeakable backbenchers , his @entity19 ' - a reference to the right - wing protest party in the @entity22			1
@entity1 is a leading member of @entity26 chancellor @entity25 's @entity24 party , his nation 's @entity4 energy commissioner and a former state premier of the wealthy state of @entity31			1
his comments have sent alarm through the corridors of power in both @entity35 and @entity36 as he is at his core a firm believer in the @entity10 project and not a man to ignore			2
but @entity1 pulled no punches in his tuesday night speech to a @entity26 , @entity45 and @entity44 meeting in @entity35 on tuesday evening			1
he said : ' it worries me that too many in @entity10 still believe that everything will be fine			2
@entity10 is ripe for overhaul			2
' he added that @entity35 had spent more time patting itself on the back about how @entity10 is civilised and a shining example to the rest of the world ' instead of fighting the financial and economic crisis '			1
he said many @entity4 members had ' ceased to function ' politically and said it worried him about ' essentially ungovernable ' nations			0
he also slammed @entity62 , currently in turmoil over a gay marriage law , as being ' completely unprepared to do what â€™s necessary to get its economy back on track '			0
he slammed the fact that it has twice as many civil servants as other @entity4 nations ' but no middle class and little in the way of innovation '			0
under fire : @entity6 has recently been criticised for going on holiday to @entity77 with his wife @entity78 instead of staying in @entity17 to focus his attention on fixing the @entity17 's problems @entity1 did not spare his own country in his speech , delivered at a time when 17 of the 27 nations of the @entity4 are still in recession and the politics of austerity seem to have failed miserably			1
although largely unscathed by the euro crisis because of its strong export economy , he said his nation is jeopardizing its economic success with a false political agenda			0
' @entity26 is at the highpoint of its economic ability			2
@entity26 will not get any stronger pursuing an agenda of child - care subsidies , quotas for women , minimum wage and rejecting fracking for natural gas , ' he said			0
he criticised @entity26 for worrying about the effects of fracking - the process whereby natural gas or oil deposits are retrieved through polluting high - pressure splitting of subterranean rock - but did not have the same concerns for the environment in @entity112 from where @entity26 imports much of its gas			1
' that 's what i call hypocrisy , ' he said			0
' the @entity26 are a pretty hypocritical lot			0
' he said environmentalists had to accept certain risks if the continent 's energy supply needs were to be met in the future .			0
