by @entity0 published : 00:14 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 2 january 2013 @entity1 has been named the most influential man in @entity3 , edging out @entity4 , prince @entity5 and even prime minister @entity6			1
the mayor of @entity8 , who won plaudits for his handling of the widely - praised @entity11 , triumphed over luminaries in politics , showbusiness and top executives in a list published by @entity17			1

power : @entity1 has been named ' @entity27 in @entity3 ' by @entity17 @entity28 : the @entity8 mayor was praised for his handling of the @entity11 and is noted for his high - profile appearances , such as his encounter with a faulty zipwire in @entity8 's @entity33 other top @entity34 in the list include @entity6 , chancellor @entity4 , education secretary @entity36 and health secretary @entity37			1

the @entity40 hit the headlines for both his military service in @entity49 and the pictures that emerged of him partying naked in a @entity52 hotel room			2
in what appears to reflect the television programme @entity56 , where a civil servant guides the decisions of the minister he is meant to be serving , sir @entity53 , cabinet secretary , was voted more influential prime minster @entity6			1
cycling heroes : gold medalist and @entity61 winner @entity20 ( left ) and sir @entity22 ( right ) were both in the top 20 the list , which is out in the february edition of the magazine that will hit stands tomorrow , the top 20 is heavily dominated by government figures , with seven political players being included			1
a spokesman for @entity17 told the @entity70 that the @entity71 had replaced press power with ' institutional scrutiny and new - media guruism '			1
she said that the list had a large proportion of old - @entity78 and wealthy figures who were more guarded about their private lives after the explosion of web gossips who discussed the details of the rich and famous			1
she added : ' untrammelled power like that wielded by @entity87 is replaced by institutional scrutiny and new - media guruism			2
' in reaction there has been a resurgence of the old guard â€“ former etonians dominate public life once more , including the mayor of @entity8 , the archbishop of @entity98 and the prime minister			2
keeping it in the family : prince @entity5 and his youngest son @entity40 both made it into the top 20 - but surprisingly the @entity104 only made it to 33rd place ' meanwhile with the rise in power of web gossip factories , businessmen are much less willing to court the public eye			0
' the flamboyant tycoons of the past have been replaced by more retiring figures who avoid the limelight			0
' money no longer shouts , it murmurs			0
' @entity17 compiled the list with a ' star chamber ' of figures at the top of their fields to help draw up ' the definitive countdown of the men who really run @entity3 '			1
