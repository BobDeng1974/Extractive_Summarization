@entity26 : @entity27 and his niece @entity28 have accused the @entity5 forces of acting too hastily in storming the @entity31 gas plant where their brother and father , @entity10 , died during the siege ' we could have done better ' : @entity28 believes her father , @entity35 ( right ) may have survived if @entity5 troops had waited for support from @entity13 and @entity39 special forces to launch an ' all - out military assault ' the four - day siege then reached its bloody climax when seven workers were executed by their @entity19 - linked captors when @entity5 special forces stormed the desert facility on saturday			1
the botched action took place as an unarmed @entity13 surveillance drone soared overhead - yet the @entity5 government had refused offers of help from @entity13 and @entity39 's crack special forces as they tried to overcome one of the biggest kidnappings ever seen in @entity56			1
mr @entity10 's older brother @entity27 said : ' my brother should not have had to die this way			2
' while details of mr @entity10 's death remain unclear , his family said the @entity5 troops should have waited for support from @entity39 or @entity13 special forces			1
terrifying : this newly released image shows an armed @entity19 militant ( in camouflage ) standing guard over @entity5 workers outside an accommodation unit of the @entity72 plant hands up : this is the moment the gas plant workers surrendered to @entity19 militants after they stormed the facility in the early hours of last wednesday morning his daughter @entity77 , 27 , told @entity79 : ' i think we could have done better than with an all - out military assault			2
that 's my personal feeling			0
' she said mr @entity10 was assured the gas field was safe before he took the job and did so because it would allow him to take one - month periods of time off to see his loved ones			0
' there are no words			0
when i was upset i could call him			0
i do n't have that anymore			0
' the four - day siege reached its bloody climax when seven workers were executed by their @entity19 - linked captors when @entity5 special forces stormed the desert facility on saturday @entity10 was one of three @entity13 who died during the stand - off at the plant in @entity16 last week two other @entity13 also died in the siege - fellow @entity101 and @entity103 - while seven made it out safely			1
