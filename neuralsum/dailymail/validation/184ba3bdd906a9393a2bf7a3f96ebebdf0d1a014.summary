a wind - up @entity1 case that can charge a phone simply by spinning a handle on the back could spell the end of ' battery anxiety '			1
designers claim the @entity9 can provide up to three hours of power by winding the handle for just five minutes			1
it also includes a usb port that allows users to charge accessories , or a friend 's mobile phone			1
he said : ' i realised that without access to power , there was no way i could stay in touch with my friends and family			1
' with millions of people facing the same issue during events like @entity29 , and more recently during @entity41 , i knew there had to be a way to keep people connected regardless of access to a traditional power source			1
' @entity9 leverages existing technology in a new way to generate power to keep mobile devices charged without having to depend on traditional power outlets			1
' @entity9 uses a magnetic dynamo generator to produce power			1
designer @entity24 said he was inspired to develop the device after being separated from his family by @entity29 in 2005			1
the handle on the back of the case can also be used as a support to prop up the phone for watching videos			2
mr @entity24 has launched a campaign on @entity62 to help fund development of the case			2
the team plans to begin shipping the device , which costs $ 59 ( £ 39.50 ) , in october 2015 @entity66 has said that the ' all day ' battery in its new watch lasts 18 hours with ' typical use '			2
however official tests have revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , three hours of talk time and 6.5 hours of music playback			0
music can be played via apps on the watch when connected to a phone , and this can be done either using the timepiece 's built - in speaker or via @entity82 headphones			2
@entity66 defines the battery on its @entity87 product page and said a time check typically lasts four seconds			0
it is likely that a notification illuminates the screen for a similar time			0
this means 90 time checks and 90 notifications equate to 12 hours of screen activity			0
when this is added to app use and workout time the total usage is 13 hours and 15 minutes			0
this leaves 4 hours and 45 minutes on standby			0
when used just as a watch , @entity66 said the device will last 48 hours if checked five times an hour			0
@entity9 uses a magnetic dynamo generator to produce the power needed to charge the phone			1
this uses a rare earth metal spinning inside a magentic field to generate electrical current inside a coil of wire spun around the magnet			0
mr @entity24 said that spinning the handle on the back of the case for one minute can provide enough battery life for 40 minutes of standby use for an @entity1 , and 20 minutes for an ipad mini			1
he has now launched a campaign on @entity62 to help develop commercial products from the prototype he and his colleagues have created			0
they plan to begin shipping the device , which costs $ 59 ( £ 39.50 ) , in october 2015			0
a usb port in the @entity9 also allows other devices or accessories to be charged using the handle ( above ) the handle of the case can be folded away when it is not in use so that it can be slipped easily into a pocket			2

@entity9 provides 40 minutes battery with a minute of winding
designer @entity24 developed the mobile case after @entity29
following the 2005 *disaster* in @entity26 he was separated from his family
he found he was unable to stay in touch with them without access to power
the @entity9 allows users to charge using a magnetic dynamo generator
it can charge a phone in the case and also be used to charge accessories
