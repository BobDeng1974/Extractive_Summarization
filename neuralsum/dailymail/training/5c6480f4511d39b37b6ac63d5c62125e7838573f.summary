the @entity1 account accidentally crashed a conversation about domestic violence yesterday by misunderstanding the meaning behind a trending hashtag , and sending out a joke tweet			1
following the release of a video that clearly showed footballer @entity11 's brutal domestic assault of then fiancée @entity12 in an @entity14 hotel elevator , other abused and battered women took to @entity1 to bravely share their stories , using # @entity16			1
that is when the @entity1 account tweeted , ' # whyistayed you had pizza			1
the person behind the account quickly realized their mistake and apologized , writing , ' a million apologies			0
did not read what the hashtag was about before posting			0
' that 's not all either , as they also then spent the entire day writing back individual responses on @entity1 to the thousands who voiced their disgust that the brand would make light of something so horrible			2
apologies : so the person behind the @entity1 account started apologizing ... and apologizing ... and apologizing ... and apologizing the flub seems to have been forgiven by most as a result , including @entity51 tv host @entity50 , who retweeted the brand 's apology after he wrote to them , ' it 's not delivery , it 's domestic violence			2
' this , of course , is a rife on @entity1 's popular slogan , ' it 's not delivery , it 's @entity61			2
' for good measure , the brand offered up one final apology this evening on @entity1 , writing , ' we heard from many of you , and we know we disappointed you			0
we understand , and we apologize to everyone for this mistake			0
' forgiven : after spending almost an entire day responding to complaints , it seems that many have forgiven the pizza brand as for @entity11 , he was fired by the @entity74 and has been indefinitely suspended from the @entity75 following the release of yesterday 's video			1
earlier today , he spoke for the first time since the video surfaced , saying he and his wife ' are in good spirits ' and that he must focus on being ' strong for my wife			0

after video of @entity11 *punching* his then fiancée went *public* , other abused woman shared their stories on @entity1 using # @entity91
pizza brand @entity61 *unknowingly* tweeted out a joke about pizza using the same hashtag , much to the horror of many on @entity1
since then , the person behind the account has spent hours apologizing for their mistake
