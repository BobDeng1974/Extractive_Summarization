@entity0 is fond of talking about the @entity1			0
but in one respect , the owner is moving away from the club ’s traditional blueprint for success this summer by buying players in bulk order			0
when @entity1 dominated the football landscape , they used to tweak their squad with one or two quality acquisitions each summer			2
now , with @entity14 gone and @entity15 due to return , manager @entity13 has been given the green light to go for quantity – understandable in one way , but risky in another			2
@entity1 have already signed six new players this summer ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity20 , @entity55 and @entity23 ( who is heading back out on loan ) from @entity58			1
@entity59 made five purchases last summer to make the leap from second to first that @entity1 are trying to emulate , but only two of them became first - team regulars			1
@entity65 were more radical and signed seven first @entity67 players to replace @entity68			2
@entity13 will argue a deeper squad is necessary with @entity1 back playing @entity15 football for the first time since 2009			1
he has tried to minimise the risk of upheaval by ensuring some of his new players have @entity34 experience			1
@entity53 , @entity52 and @entity55 helped @entity77 finish in the top half last			1
even so , nobody knows how @entity32 ’s @entity20 and @entity54 of @entity80 – both aged 20 – will fare in their first season in the @entity34			0
been there , done that : @entity55 is one of only three new signings with @entity34 experience good enough ? summer signing @entity54 ( right ) , pictured in action against @entity31 , is hoping to force his way into @entity1 's midfield next season @entity89 : @entity13 has opted to revamp his squad with a number of new additions this summer @entity52 ( £ 4million from @entity77 ) @entity34 experience : two seasons with @entity77 , scoring 28 goals			1
had turned 30 by the time he reached the top flight			0
@entity53 ( £ 25miliion from @entity77 ) @entity34 experience : two seasons with @entity77 where he played well enough to get an @entity99 call up			1
@entity20 ( £ 20million from @entity32 ) @entity34 experience : none			1
@entity54 ( £ 10million from @entity80 ) @entity34 experience : none			1
@entity55 ( £ 20million from @entity77 ) @entity34 experience : one season in @entity99 but did well at @entity77 to earn a @entity104 place for @entity105			1
@entity106 ( £ 10million from @entity58 ) @entity34 experience : none			1
last season , @entity1 ’s thrilling form was based on an almost telepathic understanding between @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity14			2
how can @entity53 , for example , be on the same attacking wavelength when he returns from an injury lay - off ? at 32 , can @entity52 adapt to the expectation at @entity117 having spent the majority of his career in the lower leagues			2
in a sense , @entity13 has had no choice but to deal			0
@entity14 wanted to go and @entity1 will have more games to play next season			2
but it would be foolish to say this is n’t a gamble			0
@entity128 struggled at @entity59 and @entity129 when he was backed by a wealthy owner who wanted lots of new players			1
even when his successor at @entity134 , @entity135 , bought in quality stars like @entity137 and @entity138 in 2010 they did n’t challenge for the title , only hitting form at the end of the season to win the @entity144			0
@entity146 ’s manager at the time @entity148 noted at the start of that season that @entity59 ‘ did n’t have a clear identity ’ as they shuffled the new signings about			0
city did add five new signings last summer and won the title ; @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			0
but only @entity156 and @entity160 were regular players at the business end of the season			0
expectation : some fans have questioned whether 32 - year - old @entity52 can step up in the absence of @entity14 next season tough start : @entity53 will need to bounce back from a six - week injury lay - off after joining for £ 25million @entity13 ’ biggest task will be to make sure last season ’s successful players @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and others do n’t lose their mojo and have their form disrupted by an army of new signings			1
last season ’s biggest turnover happened at @entity183			0
they signed 14 players and @entity186 got the sack after admitting : ‘ there are many players and many different languages - it is difficult to speak to each other			0
’ nobody is suggesting @entity13 will be as unprepared as the maverick @entity194			0
but @entity1 fans who think more is naturally better may be in for a shock .			0

@entity1 have signed six players already this summer
only @entity53 , @entity52 and @entity55 have @entity34 experience
@entity13 has opted to revamp his squad after the sale of @entity14 to @entity29 for £ 75million
@entity65 struggled last season after spending over £ 100m on new players
@entity128 experienced difficulties at @entity59 and @entity129 after bringing in a large number of new faces
