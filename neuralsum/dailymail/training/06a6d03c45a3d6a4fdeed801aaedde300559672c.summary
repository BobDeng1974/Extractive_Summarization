of all the places you 'd expect to find an 8ft snake that squeezes rats and birds to death , central @entity0 probably would n't be the first			2
but a colony of the beasts has been living beside the capital 's @entity9 - despite being powerful enough to kill a small cat or dog			1
now a row has broken out after a government quango said the snakes were an ' invasive species ' which could be culled , even though they may have been living peacefully in the city for decades			1
invasive : a colony of around 30 @entity22 snakes has been living by @entity0 's @entity9 ( file photo ) it is not known for certain where the snakes came from , but it is thought their ancestors may have escaped several years ago from @entity29			1
they are native to central @entity31 and are already a foot long when they hatch , before growing to their adult length of four to five feet			0
some have been recorded growing up to 8ft long			0
it is thought the snakes ' ancestors may have escaped from @entity29 ( file photo ) the snakes are non-venomous , and instead kill small animals by constricting them			1
but now the animals face a possible cull after a government quango , the @entity44 , marked them as a ' non-native species of high concern '			1
the quango put the species in its second highest - priority group and said the snakes would require ' control , management , eradication etc. ' it added staff would have to ' establish ecology , breeding sites and methods of removal '			0
the plans come despite a colony of the animals having lived peacefully for several decades in @entity64 after they escaped from the @entity65 , in @entity66			1
dr @entity67 of @entity68 , who works with the @entity65 colony , hit out at the plans as a possible waste of resources			0
he said : ' any attempt to eradicate the @entity22 snake would require justification of resources to be devoted to an almost certainly non-problematic introduced species with little prospects of spread , as opposed to the many far more damaging species already out there			2
' from a wider and more philosophical point of view , we should ask ourselves what we can really conserve			0
popular : the @entity9 is a summer hangout for thousands of people - but they have not been alone ' given the near certainty of massive global climate change over the next century , the idea that we can treat the @entity90 fauna and flora like some kind of pre-industrial vicarage garden and preserve it forever without any changes is simply farcical			2
' lisi manager @entity98 said : ' [ the ] aesculapian snake species is listed in the @entity100 , meaning it is illegal to allow the species to spread or escape into the wild			0
' at present there is limited information on what affects the species may have on our local ecosystems			0

colony of 30 @entity22 snakes has been living by @entity9
they are not venomous but kill prey like rats by constricting them
snakes now face possible cull by @entity44
expert *criticised* *decision* and said colony already lives peacefully in @entity124
