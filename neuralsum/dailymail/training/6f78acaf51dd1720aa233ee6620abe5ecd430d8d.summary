@entity0 left @entity1 full - back @entity2 on the floor with a fleet - footed piece of skill on the right flank and burst to the byline , with five @entity10 team - mates waiting in the box for that killer cross			1
then , with no - one around him and time to pick out a man , he went for an unnecessary , extravagant rabona pass			2
as his left boot wrapped around the outside of his right , the ball skewed off the pitch			0
another chance wasted , an opportunity gone			0
his team - mates looked away			0
it just about summed up @entity0 's match			2
@entity0 gave the ball away 51 times			1
he struck 19 crosses and only four of them were any good			1
his pass completion was down at 63 per cent , the worst of any outfield player to start the game and the worst of any player in the tournament who has played more than 40 minutes of a match			1
' i suppose that 's what this @entity72 is about , the worst player on the pitch scores the winning goal , ' @entity76 said afterwards on the @entity78			2
' he was lucky to still be on there when he scored as he had played so badly			0
' he only lost the ball 51 times ? that 's amazing , i thought he lost it more than that			1
' @entity84 further twisted the knife , adding : ' he gave it away so many times , whether it was on the left - hand side , whether it was on the right - hand side , whether he was coming down the middle			2
' he lost possession so many times trying to whip balls in and constantly hitting the front man			0
' difference : @entity0 touched the ball plenty ( right ) but his completed passes were few and far between heat map : @entity0 was all over the place and gave the ball away a staggering 51 times @entity104 : @entity0 runs with the ball as @entity106 tries to stop him near the touchline @entity0 's passes were intercepted â€“ short ones , long ones , mid-distance ones ; high ones , low ones			1
his crosses were cut out , or headed away			0
his runs mainly ended at the first man			0
the astonishingly bad level of his performance was the antithesis of his incredibly high tenacity to keep going and going and going			0
he struck 12 shots during the game , even though only three of those landed on target			0
@entity50 , who admittedly had a poorer game than his usual standard , must 've wondered what he had to do to help his team through after creating eight goal - scoring chances in the match before @entity0 finally converted one of them in extra-time			1
@entity0 has missed just one minute so far of @entity10 's @entity72 campaign , coming off in the final minute of their 1 - 0 win against @entity136 in the group stage			1
their last - 16 game on tuesday was the one blip in an otherwise solid tournament from the 26 - year - old			0
although , like the rest of his @entity10 team - mates , he has been bailed out by @entity50 on too many occasions			2
but regardless of all the damning statistics and the armchair critics , @entity84 summed it up succinctly : ' you know what ? no - one will remember that whatsoever			0
they 'll remember that one piece of magic that got them through to the quarter - finals , that 's what people will remember			1
' drama : @entity0 celebrates netting his last - minute goal in extra-time for @entity10 embrace : @entity50 was the architect of the goal as he set @entity0 up to score the winner finish : @entity165 keeper @entity164 could do nothing to stop the ball from going in contrast : @entity10 players celebrate while @entity165 players fall to the floor following the full - time whistle heartbreak : @entity174 can not hold back his disappointment after the @entity165 crashed out in @entity176 @entity177 : @entity10 fans celebrate following @entity0 's goal - a rare contribution on an off day for the midfielder			1

@entity0 wins match for @entity10 in dying minutes of extra-time against @entity1 to book place in @entity72 quarter - finals
@entity0 gave ball away 51 times and just four out of 19 crosses were good
pass completion was 63 per cent - worst in the tournament of those who have played more than 40 minutes
