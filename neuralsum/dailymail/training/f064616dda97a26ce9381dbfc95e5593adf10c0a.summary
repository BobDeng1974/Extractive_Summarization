@entity1 's first competitive game as @entity3 manager ended in defeat as @entity5 spoiled the @entity7 party			1
midfielder @entity8 put the @entity9 ahead , and despite @entity11 's acrobatic equaliser , @entity3 fell to defeat after @entity12 scored from close range			1
@entity15 's @entity14 gives his opinion on the performances from both sets of players			0
indecisive and hesitant on the ball on occasions @entity51 6.5 – composed @entity53 debut			0
looked more comfortable on the ball than both @entity44 and @entity55 at times @entity57 6 – unlucky to be forced off after 24 minutes after a bright start although injury looked a lot worse at first @entity61 6.5 – did his job well but players around him lacked the creativity to open up @entity5 lacking : @entity61 worked hard but never found the creativity needed to unlock @entity5 's defence @entity67 6 – still getting to grips with the pace of the @entity71 game and was caught in possession			2
@entity73 young 5.5 – promising going forward but defensively suspect again as he lost @entity75 in the build - up to second goal @entity78 6 – can still give so much more			0
wasted a couple set - pieces by putting them too close to the keeper @entity82 5 – largely anonymous performance showed why he will probably be on his way			0
replaced by @entity85 at half - time @entity11 6.5 – couple of ambitious efforts in the first half but new skipper got @entity3 back on terms with the equaliser level : @entity11 leaps to slam home an overhead kick and level the score at 1 - 1 captain fantastic : @entity11 celebrates finding the net n his first game as permanent captain substitutes : @entity102 ( for @entity103 24 ) , @entity85 ( for @entity104 46 ) , @entity105 , @entity106 ( for @entity107 67 ) , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110			1
scorer : @entity11 53 manager : @entity1 – 5.5 impact : @entity114 made something of a difference in the second half , but it was n't enough for @entity3 work to do : it was a difficult start for @entity3 's new boss , who will have to rethink his 3 - 5 - 2 formation @entity5 @entity122 fabianski 6.5 – must have though he would be tested more by @entity3 but reliable when required @entity124 6.5 – typically strong performance from him at right - back , subduing both @entity127 and then januzaj down the @entity3 left @entity128 7 – got in a couple of important blocks and looked solid alongside @entity131 solid : @entity128 stops @entity11 getting away , during an encouraging performance at the back @entity135 7.5 – made some fantastic interceptions , not least when @entity11 looked as though he was through in the second half @entity139 5.5 – rash challenge on @entity102 earned him a booking and replaced eight minutes after the restart @entity143 6.5 – great job shielding the @entity5 defence and then launching the breakaway attacks @entity8 7 – helped keep @entity3 at bay and got forward to take his chance really well opener : @entity8 had put @entity5 ahead in the first half with a well - placed finish @entity152 6.5 – energetic performance summed up by fne run in the build - up to the first goal @entity12 8 – match - winning display			1
kept his cool to score the second goal from close range , having played a part in the first goal as well			0
get in : @entity12 finds the net from close range to win the game for @entity5 @entity165 6.5 – a real threat down the right for @entity5 even though his cross for the second goal was actually a shot @entity170 7 – a real handful for the @entity173 defence throughout			2
they never quite got to grips with the big man			0
handful : @entity170 may not have got on the scoresheet but he was a constant thorn in the side of united 's defence subs : @entity183 ( for @entity39 ) , @entity184 ( for @entity185 ) , @entity186 ( for @entity187 67 ) , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191			2
manager : @entity193 – 7 scorers : ki 28 , @entity12 72 booked : @entity187 , @entity185 , @entity143 referee : @entity196 7 @entity197 man : @entity12			1

@entity12 stars as @entity193 's side ruin @entity21 's @entity7 debut
@entity3 manager 's *tactical* *tweaks* do n't work as his side start *season* poorly
@entity11 overhead kick the only major plus for @entity3 in defeat
