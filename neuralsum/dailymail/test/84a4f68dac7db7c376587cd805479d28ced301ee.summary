the tragic death of a seven - week - old baby in his mother ’s bed has led a coroner to demand new guidelines to warn parents of the dangers of sleeping next to newborns			1
‘ well cared - for and loved ’ @entity9 was found lying face down and unresponsive the morning after @entity11 , 26 , took him to bed			1
at the baby ’s inquest this week , a coroner in @entity15 said new parents were given ‘ confusing ’ advice over how tired they could be when they slept in the same bed as their child			1
tragedy : @entity9 , who was described as ' well cared - for and loved ' , was sharing a bed with his mother @entity11 ( pictured together ) when he died in his sleep last october co-sleeping : mrs @entity11 had taken her son to bed with her at the family home in @entity31 , @entity32 but the next morning he was ' lying face down and unresponsive ' , an inquest heard the @entity37 government ’s ‘ reducing the risk of cot death ’ leaflet , which offers similar advice to the @entity39 in @entity40 , says parents should not share a bed with a young baby if they ‘ feel very tired ’ , take drugs , smoke , or have drunk alcohol			1
but coroner @entity49 said : ‘ the advice is that it is not wrong to share a bed with your baby – but you should refrain from doing so if you are “ excessively tired ”			1
it is a fact of life that parents or carers of a young infant would be very tired because of the baby ’s erratic sleep pattern			2
‘ it suggests that it ’s okay to go to sleep with your baby if you are not very tired			0
but very few people will sleep unless they ’re actually tired			0
’ the bedsharing guidance does stress that the safest place for a baby under six months to sleep is in their own cot in the same room as its parents			2
but new mothers sometimes struggle with this – especially if they are breastfeeding – because the easiest place to do this is in bed			0
miss @entity11 had been to a party and had ‘ a little to drink ’ before she , her baby and a friend all shared the bed at the family home in @entity85 , @entity32 , in october last year			1
the next morning @entity9 was found ‘ face down and unresponsive ’			1
@entity15 coroner @entity49 said the current advice on ' co-sleeping ' is ' confusing ' @entity89 heard how attempts were made to resuscitate @entity9 but he could not be saved			1
tests later showed his brain had been starved of @entity94 pathologist @entity93 told the inquest there was no specific cause of death but it was typical of @entity100 or ‘ cot death ’			1
he said : ‘ the cause of death might be sudden unexplained death in infancy while bed sharing			2
examination showed a suggestion that the brain had an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood shortly before @entity9 died			1
’ the coroner recorded an open conclusion and said the death could not be explained on pathological grounds , adding : ‘ there is no doubt that he was well cared for and loved by his family			1
sadly it is not uncommon for a baby to die with no obvious cause of death			0
’ the @entity37 government said it will consider the coroner ’s comments , but said its guidance was ‘ very clear ’ and was reviewed by experts last year			0
chief medical officer for @entity37 dr @entity128 said : ‘ we will consider the coroner ’s correspondence to us and respond appropriately in due course			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) , which issues health guidelines in @entity40 and @entity37 , said : ‘ sharing a bed with your baby at night can aid breastfeeding and in some cultures , co-sleeping is seen as perfectly normal			2
but the @entity142 advises that the safest place for a baby to sleep is in a cot			0
’ the clinical director of the @entity39 watchdog has admitted guidelines for preventing cot deaths are ‘ confusing ’			2
the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) published advice for @entity40 and @entity37 in december which told parents there was a strong link between co-sleeping and cot death , or @entity157			1
but guidelines do not tell women they should n’t bring their babies into bed – even though it makes the risk of death five times higher			0
the watchdog stopped short of telling women not to take babies to bed in case the advice interfered with breastfeeding guidelines			0
professor @entity173 , @entity134 clinical director , said : ‘ it ’s quite a confusing message , it is not clear			0
we ’re not telling people not to co-sleep , we know that could get in the way with breastfeeding , but there is an association there with @entity157			0
’ he added : ‘ we are between a rock and hard place			0
the only recommendation we could have made would be to avoid co-sleeping , but it would be seen as incompatible with breastfeeding guidelines			0
’ there are currently around 300 cot deaths in the @entity191 every year			0
however professor @entity192 , from the @entity193 , has estimated that around 120 cot deaths could be prevented every year in the @entity191 if parents were advised not to co-sleep			2
inquest : mr @entity49 recorded an open conclusion and said @entity9 's death could not be explained on pathological grounds - but a pathologist said it was typical of @entity100 or ' cot death '			1

@entity9 died in his mother @entity11 's bed in october last year
' well cared - for and loved ' baby was found ' face - down and unresponsive '
coroner says advice should be *changed* to suggest never bed - sharing
@entity39 says not to if parents smoke , drink , have taken drugs or are very tired
open *verdict* on @entity9 's death but pathologist said it was likely a cot death
