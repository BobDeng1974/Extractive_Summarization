it was a day of peculiar reunions as @entity3 ’s players returned to the club ’s @entity5 training ground for their first ball - playing sessions of pre-season on monday morning			1
in the absence of newly appointed manager @entity12 , assistant coach @entity10 assumed responsibilities on the training field , but it was the make - up of the playing staff , rather than coaching staff , that was causing near jaw - ache among the chattering classes at the club ’s @entity5			2
all those players who did not appear at the @entity22 in @entity23 returned late last week for the usual rigorous medical testing to assess how their fitness had been maintained in the close season			0
however , there was also much consternation as several loanees returned to the club - including cast - offs such as the @entity51 winger @entity27 and the @entity23 midfielder @entity52 - with their tails firmly between their legs			2
@entity27 was signed in a bizarre £ 7million deal in the summer of 2011 - despite sir @entity56 later admitting he had not seen the winger play - and the 23 - year - old is still yet to start a @entity59 match four years later			1
flop : £ 7million @entity27 ( left ) was one of the players who reported to @entity3 's pre-season training on monday change of scene : @entity52 spent the second half of last season on loan to serie a outfit @entity68 he was the one player immediately written off by @entity69 last summer and it is understood that @entity12 will adopt the same approach towards a player with one year left on a five - year contract			1
@entity3 will loan @entity27 out for a third consecutive season or sell him on a permanent deal if they can find a buyer			0
@entity52 , for his part , became a source of frustration for @entity69 over his perceived lack of fitness , evidenced by the damning statistic that he has completed ninety minutes of @entity59 football on only 18 % of the 104 appearances he has made in a seven - year spell of fluctuating form at @entity87			1
he endured a stuttering loan spell at @entity68 in the second half of last season and @entity3 may encounter trouble as they attempt to recoup in excess of £ 20m for the player signed by sir @entity56 on the recommendation of his brother , @entity93 , who said : ‘ @entity56 , he ’s better than ( @entity96 ) @entity95			0
’ familiar sight : @entity52 has only completed 18 % of the 104 @entity59 appearances he has started there was , however , excitement to see the return of several young and talented players to the club , including @entity104 from @entity105 , who is hoping to be granted a clean slate by @entity34 after being frozen out by @entity69 over his perceived failure to grasp the immaculate standards expected of a @entity3 player on the training ground			1
@entity111 , who @entity112 understands who would have been promoted into the first - team pool had @entity56 remained in charge last season , has also returned after a campaign with @entity117 , along with 21 - year - old forward @entity118 from @entity119 and @entity121 striker @entity120 , who struggled to make an impact on loan at @entity124 last season			0
assistant manager @entity10 is believed to have pencilled in meetings with every player for this week and he will advise @entity34 over the right course of action with @entity3 ’s young players , although any decision will ultimately be rubber - stamped the @entity131			0
on the ball : @entity104 will hope to impress @entity3 's this season after being loaned out last campaign up for the challenge : @entity111 ( left ) has returned to @entity3 after an impressive loan spell at @entity117 @entity137 will rebuild @entity3 - @entity138			0

@entity3 players returned to their first ball - playing pre-season sessions on monday
@entity27 and @entity52 were *involved* at the @entity5
@entity27 is yet to start a @entity59 game for @entity3 despite joining for £ 7million four years *ago*
@entity52 has only completed 18 % of the 104 @entity59 games he has started for the @entity148 during a seven - year speall
@entity10 took charge in the absence of @entity12 - who is away on @entity22 duty with @entity36
