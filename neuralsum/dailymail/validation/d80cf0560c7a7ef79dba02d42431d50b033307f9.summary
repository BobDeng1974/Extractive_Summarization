while driverless cars wo n't be cruising down the motorway anytime soon , they could soon find their way into our airports and campuses			1
ten @entity8 cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year , with the first being unveiled in @entity10 , @entity11 in the spring			1
meanwhile , trials will launch in another 12 to 20 @entity8 locations by the end of next year , which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 @entity8 cities by 2017			1
meanwhile , trials will launch in another 12 to 20 @entity8 locations by the end of next year			1
@entity21 in the @entity22 will also be trialling the technology ( artist 's impression pictured ) the trials use vehicles developed by @entity29 - based @entity28 , according to a report in the @entity31			1
these vary in size from two - seaters to large buses			0
' some will be on the roads where it 's legal , ' @entity38 , a strategist for automated transportation systems who runs the firm told @entity41			1
elsewhere , he said the focus will be on college campuses , theme parks , airports and downtown areas			1
' the whole goal is to launch pilots so we can collect data to help with the regulations that will legalise the cars , ' he added			1
for instance , in the @entity56 's @entity55 in @entity57 , automated pod - like cars will transport wounded troops from their barracks			1
' it 's a wounded warrior campus , and we 're going to start pretty small with two essentially big gulf carts to take the soldiers from living quarters to the hospital next door , ' said @entity38			1
pictured are the locations who have publicly agreed to pilot projects under the @entity72 programme			1
@entity72 's ultimate goal is to have the project running in 30 states , but said that some are not yet ready to announce plans ' starting with two vehicles our goal is getting up to six to eight			1
' the programme , run by @entity72 , is also planning a pilot project at the @entity83 at @entity83 , at the @entity84 , as well as two more projects in @entity11			1
meanwhile 70 - person automated vehicles will operate in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity91			2
@entity72 's ultimate goal is to have the pilots running in 30 states , but said that some areas are not yet ready to announce their plans			1
as well as the @entity8 , the @entity22 will also be trialing the vehicles in @entity21 as part of the $ 9 million project called @entity98 , shuttling people to the @entity100			1
@entity38 explained that the technology works in the same way as @entity104 's driverless vehicles			1
an on - board computer uses data from sensors , including radar , a laser and cameras , to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles			0
@entity38 , who is co-ordinating the trials told @entity41 that an accident involved a driverless car is inevitable - although he added none have taken place in his pilots			1
' systems will fail , people 's judgements will fail , ' he said			2
' if someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle , if it ca n't stop , it ca n't stop			2
' ' it 's interesting to see people 's reactions ' , said @entity38			1
' very few are nervous , or noticeably nervous			0
' most of them are curious , excited intrigued and many of them are very comfortable – or they soon get comfortable			0
' ' we 've had interesting reactions from non-riders too			0
we were in the @entity138 and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen			2
' ' the vehicles stopped			0
we 've never had an accident			0
' a recent report by the @entity146 highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars			0
motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front , but were less able to react quickly			2
however , many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans			2
software that guide and control the cars will have to be written with a high degree of accuracy and contain fail - safes , while cars will need to be regularly maintained to ensure there are no faults			0
@entity104 has also been teaching its vehicles to drive more safely by giving them instructions on ' defensive driving ' styles			0
they have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles ' body language ' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are			0
passengers can set their destination on some of the vehicles by typing it into a map or using commands			0
a combination of radar , lasers gives the car a 360 - degree ' view ' , with sensors linked to computer software able to ' see ' and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights			0

' @entity28 will fail , people 's judgements will fail			2
if someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle , if it ca n't stop , it ca n't stop			2
' ' it 's important we figure out alleviate the problem , to keep moving forward '			2

ten @entity8 cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year
the first is @entity248 , @entity11 , with 20 other locations following next year
company behind the pilot says it 's not ready to announce full locations
pilots will be focused on areas such as campuses , parks and airports
no accidents have so far taken place , but @entity38 , who is running the pilots , told @entity41 that an injury is inevitable
