by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:58 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 3 november 2013 shocking details of the unpublished report into electoral fraud in @entity7 's @entity6 constituency have been revealed , showing evidence of forgery , coercion , trickery and manipulation			1
the @entity14 union has been accused of trying to fix the selection of the @entity7 candidate in the party 's safe seat and @entity19 ordered an enquiry into goings - on , only to abandon the inquiry and refuse to publish what was discovered			1
however , extracts from the report are contained in a @entity14 document compiled to reject the accusations against the union			1
a report by @entity14 on @entity7 's investigation into alleged vote rigging by @entity14 members has revealed details of alleged fraud			1
@entity19 , pictured on the @entity34 last week , ordered the investigation but refuses to publish the findings it says @entity7 's probe found evidence that signatures and documents were forged , new recruits pressured to join @entity7 and even tricked into signing up			1
there is also evidence that membership fees were paid by a third party			1
published in today 's @entity48 , the report states : ' it is not unusual for complaints to be made about all aspects of the selection procedure but these complaints are of particular concern because of the number of members involved			1
' there is a line to be drawn between recruting members who support the aims of the party and the recruitment of large numbers of paper members who have no wish to participate except at the behest of others in an attempt to manipulate the party			1
' the union has been accused of trying to pack the @entity70 with @entity14 members to win selection for his assistant @entity73 , left the report also states that there are concerns over 112 applications or direct debit forms , and 14 show evidence of being paid for by someone other than the person named , a violation of party rules			1
@entity14 's document denies all the allegations outlined and today it released a rebuttal of the claims made in @entity48 , claiming their responses to questions sent to them by the newspaper were ignored			1
it said : ' this report is a rehash of issues already investigated by @entity96 and the @entity70 , both of which found that @entity14 had done nothing wrong , and had broken neither the law nor the party ’s rule book as it stood at the time			1
' specifically , @entity14 entirely denies any involvement in or knowledge of the forging of signatures on application forms or of any documents whatsoever ; the coercing of individuals to join the @entity70 – however that might be accomplished ; the recruitment of individuals to the party without their knowledge or any other breach of @entity70 rules			2
' @entity14 called for an independent public enquiry into what happened in @entity6 , and we remain entirely happy to assist such an inquiry – and draw appropriate lessons from it if necessary – should one be established			2
' some of the questions submitted , however , appear to relate to conduct by third parties , about which @entity14 can not comment			2
' @entity14 would also point out that once individuals join the @entity70 they can involve themselves as much or as little in the party ’s business as they choose , but @entity14 would certainly encourage any of its members to play as full a part in the party ’s life as they can			2
' today the @entity134 reported @entity135 is at the centre of @entity7 ’s vote - rigging row in @entity6 after one of the candidates for the seat directly accused him of trying to fix the selection			1
@entity142 , a @entity143 communications expert , said @entity19 ’s former campaigns chief had used his power in the party to try to install his union - backed office assistant as the candidate			2
@entity149 , left , has accused @entity19 ally @entity135 , right , of being key to the vote - rigging scandal in @entity6 , @entity152			2
police investigated in may amid claims the party was packed with @entity14 members mr @entity142 also claimed that mr @entity135 had been involved in ‘ all the shenanigans ’ , including trying to pack the @entity6 party with members of the @entity14 union to win selection for his assistant , @entity73			2
he also alleged that the party leadership ‘ knew what was going on ’			0
it is the first time mr @entity135 , who stepped down from his frontbench role in the wake of the row , has been publicly accused by another party figure of trying to influence the selection process			0
mr @entity135 did not respond to messages but has previously denied any wrongdoing or involvement in the alleged ‘ fix ’ of the selection process in @entity6			0
the explosive claims come just days before the contest to succeed @entity179 , who quit the party after a commons bar brawl , is reopened in the @entity152 seat			0
mr @entity183 is married to @entity185 mp @entity184 , pictured @entity7 suspended the selection in may after @entity134 revealed it was investigating allegations of vote - rigging by @entity14 and had referred the matter to the police			1
ms @entity73 and the local party chairman , @entity191 , were also suspended - triggering a knock - on threat of industrial action by @entity14 at the nearby @entity195 petrochemical plant , where mr @entity191 is a union convener			0
mr @entity19 dropped the investigation in september after key witnesses withdrew their testimony			0
mr @entity142 , the @entity199 political director of communications firm @entity200 , made his remarks at a party fundraising dinner last week			0
he described an atmosphere of ‘ serious intimidation ’ during the selection process - claiming he and fellow candidates had ‘ all been taken out in one way or another ’			0
he told how mr @entity135 had tried to help ms @entity73 by ‘ packing ’ the local party with @entity14 members , ‘ getting them put on the membership list ... they had a spreadsheet of names and a cheque , and he phoned up party office and said you need to accept this ’			2
he described the reaction of @entity222 as ‘ it ’s a bit dodgy ... not sure about this ’ , adding about mr @entity135 : ‘ he was involved in it all behind the scenes ... all the shenanigans , pushing things through ’			0
but mr @entity142 said that when the party leadership uncovered the allegations it tried to broker a deal with @entity14 for ms @entity73 to quietly stand down : ‘ the party came to a deal ... we ’re not going to investigate this stuff that ’s gone on , we know what ’s all gone on , but you have to pull out of the selection , ’ adding : ‘ their preference was , we know it ’s all happened but it ’s better for everyone if you just pull out			0
’ shortly before the process was suspended , mr @entity142 was eliminated from contention when an all - female shortlist was imposed			0
mr @entity142 , who is married to @entity247 mp @entity184 , said he still had not ruled out being selected when the process is reopened			0
the allegations follow the leak of emails last week which appeared to show @entity14 officials were involved in a bid to undermine @entity7 ’s inquiry			1
@entity14 dismissed the suggestion and said neither the law nor party rules had been broken in the selection process			0
last night , a senior party source said : ‘ we have acted swiftly and decisively throughout the process , and the candidate at the centre of the issue has now withdrawn			0
’ mr @entity142 did not comment .			0
