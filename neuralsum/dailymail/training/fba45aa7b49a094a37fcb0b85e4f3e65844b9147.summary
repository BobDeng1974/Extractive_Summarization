by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale a @entity1 is looking highly likely to be staged for the first time , with golf chiefs from both sides of the @entity5 involved in talks to make it happen			1
setting up an over- 50s matchplay tournament between the @entity9 and @entity10 has been in discussion for some time , now that the @entity1 has become such a major event			1
but the impetus has come from the crop of @entity10 players newly eligible to play seniors golf , who would ensure a highly competitive event rather than @entity9 dominance			1
impetus : @entity21 , who won the @entity1 as a player and captain , is backing the move these include @entity21 , who has won two senior majors this year , as well as sir @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 — all of whom have been @entity10 captains in the @entity1			1
@entity34 , the @entity36 president , said : ‘ we are analysing the possibility of hosting a senior @entity1 , but there are a lot of moving parts to evaluate			1
’ @entity42 , chief executive of the @entity43 , also confirmed discussions were progressing between the stakeholders , but said it was too early to forecast a starting date or definitive format			0
the speculation suggests 10 - a - side teams , with the first event to be televised by @entity52 in the @entity9 in september next year			1
thursday ’s senior moment from 83 - year - old @entity54 was the @entity56 television commentator mixing up @entity9 golfer @entity57 ( right ) with @entity59 great @entity58			1
spot the difference : @entity54 confused @entity9 golfer @entity57 ( left ) with ex-footballer @entity58 ( right ) the @entity61 , having made all three of their editorial staff redundant this week , attempted on thursday to turn off a new , irreverent , ball - by - ball audio commentary alternative to the @entity56 ’s @entity64			1
@entity65 was set up by the @entity67 team , also sidelined by @entity68			0
junior operatives from the magazine were sent around to retrieve the @entity72 viewing card utilised by @entity67			0
they went away empty - handed because @entity65 were using the television facilities of @entity74 for their lord ’s online commentary			2
the relationship between @entity78 organisers the @entity79 and the @entity43 is always spiky			0
so something can be read into the @entity43 temporary offices at @entity82 being situated next to the caddie shack , while the @entity79 rooms are in prime position next to the clubhouse			0
@entity56 ’s army at @entity78 @entity88 take an army of personnel to every event they cover			1
the @entity78 is no different with 186 @entity56 people employed on their @entity82 operation , significantly more than the 156 golfers competing			2
a spokeswoman said : ‘ every member of the team has a clear and accountable role and staff on site work incredibly hard			2
’ bloated : @entity101 and @entity54 are part of the @entity56 team that has more staff then the @entity78 has players controversial : @entity106 , who broke the rules at the @entity78 in @entity108 in october , is part of the @entity56 team the @entity56 radio team includes @entity106 as a summariser , despite him being found guilty of breaking the rules in the @entity112 in @entity108 last october when he was judged to have deliberately tapped down a spike mark			1
the @entity79 might be in a position to announce the successor to retiring chief executive @entity116 in september , with headhunters @entity118 having produced a shortlist of candidates			2
the search can hardly go worse for @entity118 than their botched eight - month recruitment of a ceo for @entity124			2
the @entity79 are no respecters of reputation — even when it comes to the august membership of host club @entity129			0
@entity131 , the financial director of a multi-national company and a former @entity82 committee man , was due to do scoring duties on two days , but was curtly dismissed by an @entity79 operative after failing to turn up for a second briefing , not believing it was necessary			0
no mercy : the @entity79 are determined to be fair at this year 's @entity78 , and have dismissed @entity131 an @entity79 spokesman said : ‘ we ca n’t have one rule for one and another for everybody else			0
’ the disappearance of @entity145 ’s champagne tent , an @entity78 institution since 1969 , follows the @entity79 wanting a massive increase in their previous £ 100,000 licensing agreement			0
the @entity79 are now running the tent — hidden away at @entity82 — on their own .			0
