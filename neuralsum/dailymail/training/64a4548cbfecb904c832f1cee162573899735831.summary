by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 with the aim to win the @entity5 for the first time in five years , @entity3 arrived at @entity7 with a host of new faces ready to lead a title charge			1
@entity11 splashed the cash in the summer , spending £ 32million on @entity13 and £ 30million on @entity14			1
@entity11 also resigned former @entity16 striker @entity15 on a free and recalled @entity17 from his loan spell at @entity19			1
but how did the four @entity3 new boys get on ? @entity21 takes a look at the summer arrivals who helped the @entity16 to a 3 - 1 win at @entity26			1
@entity14 it 's like @entity14 has never been away from the @entity5			2
the @entity28 international had spent the previous three years desperately trying to become a key player at @entity31 but he already looked integral to @entity3 within one half of football			0
in control : @entity14 ran the midfield on his @entity3 debut in a standout performance key player : @entity14 is congratulated by @entity39 after assisting the @entity41 's goal dominant : @entity21 's @entity42 shows how @entity14 controlled the @entity3 midfield click here to view more maps and stats with our excellent @entity42 the former @entity49 midfielder assisted @entity39 ’s goal from a corner , but it was his first - time pass from the edge of the box for @entity55 ’s strike which will have @entity16 fans purring			1
it ’s already set to go down as one of the passes of the season			0
tougher tests lie in wait for the 27 - year - old though			0
verdict 9/10 @entity13 there ’s plenty more to come from @entity13 , who did n’t have many chances to make his mark on his @entity3 debut			1
but when they did come , he looked encouragingly sharp			0
the striker was first on the scene to convert a rebound and the @entity16 equaliser after a cross rebounded off the post			0
while the 25 - year - old showed his sharpness to latch on to a woeful back - pass before being unfortunately booked for diving after being brought down by @entity7 keeper @entity79			2
up and running : @entity13 scored on his @entity3 debut and was unfortunate not to win a penalty kick well done , lad : @entity11 was pleased with @entity13 's performance speaking post-match better nights will come for @entity13 to show off his hefty price tag but he already looks well on his way to becoming a fan favourite			2
verdict 7.5/10 @entity17 seen as the long term future for @entity3 by boss @entity11 , but @entity17 did n’t look it after allowing @entity91 ’s 14th minute strike to fly past him a little too easily			1
that ’s perhaps a little harsh on the @entity93 making his debut , but the 22 - year - old would soon show why he has been given the nod over veteran @entity97 , denying @entity91 ’s top corner bound drive later in the game with a superb one - handed stop			0
kicking practice : @entity17 had little to do on his @entity3 debut in goal keeper 's ball : but the @entity93 looked confident in commanding his box and gathering crosses it was one of the very few saves @entity17 had to make during the game , but the former @entity19 stopper commanded his box well and was not shy in racing off his line to collect a cross			2
@entity11 ’s faith in the keeper looks like it will pay off			0
verdict 7/10 @entity15 given six minutes to make his mark , it was n’t going to be the toughest of tests on the 36 - year - old legs of @entity15			2
but the veteran striker still nearly rolled back the years on his second @entity16 debut , neatly controlling a long goal kick from @entity17 before unleashing a powerful volley just wide with his next touch			0
eye on the ball : @entity15 soon got involved with the game despite playing just six minutes still got it : @entity15 showed flashes of brilliance with a volley which flew just wide @entity11 at the very least may have just found his ultimate super sub , with the @entity132 looking lively and still showing he has the ability to compete at the top			1
the stamina test will come another day			0

@entity14 , @entity13 and @entity17 shine on @entity3 debuts
@entity15 also showed flashe *sof* ability in six - minute cameo
*blues* *strolled* to *comfortable* 3 - 1 *victory* at @entity7
