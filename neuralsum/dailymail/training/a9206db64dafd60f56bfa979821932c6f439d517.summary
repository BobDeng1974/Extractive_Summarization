for @entity1 and his family , real life is in the mountain , with their forty goats			2
' this is the way my ancestors lived , it 's my fate , ' he tells me , liberally sloshing more home - distilled grappa into shot glasses			1
in the thirty years he has lived with his wife , and later his daughters and granddaughter , in this simple home perched on the hillside above the @entity22 old town and the bow - ­ tie shaped southern part of the bay , he has seen cataclysmic change , the landscape pushed and pulled by tradition versus progression			1
once , communist - owned factories chugged below ; now , ecology is thriving , @entity1 grows all his own food and only descends for beer , coffee and sugar			2
a view over @entity36 from the home of @entity1 and his family , who live the simple life away from the modernisation of @entity40 apart from the odd horror during the @entity42 i knew little about @entity40 , except that it sounded green , but somehow moody and grey , in the shadow of huge mountains ­ and of course , that lots of millionaires live there			1
now , daring to dip a toe into the world of multi ­ - generational holiday , i 'm here with my mother , and i see that i was right			1
but of course , that 's just the tip of the iceberg			2
we begin in @entity60 , where the biggest news is the 287 million euro @entity40 – baby of @entity64 gold ­ miner @entity65 , which calls itself the @entity69 's first megayacht marina			1
once a military factory with large berths once for warships , now home to behemoth yachts where discerning super rich can remain anonymous and enjoy the deliciously swanky @entity76 hotel , a sophisticated nightclub , three tennis courts , five lavish restaurants , lido swimming pool and 45 shops metres of retail space			2
@entity83 became an @entity69 playground for the rich and famous in the 1960s but the break - up of @entity86 saw its decline the peaceful waters of @entity36 : here , old men sit contented with their coffee and cigarettes , enjoying the quiet life superyachts up to 80 - foot long and megayachts over 164 - foot long cost between £ 15,000 and £ 40,000 per year to moor here but i 'm told per metre of yacht , owners pay one million euros , so it 's a mere drop in the ocean			1
but the most curious thing here is 165 - foot 1969 @entity105 submarine pitched up next to the 210 - foot infinity pool and @entity107 , the nightclub			1
it was bought from the @entity110 for a large , unnamed sum and then brought back to life by its last captain			2
it seems jarring to see such a blatant reminder of communism in amongst all this pomp			0
in @entity124 , looking over the city scape , @entity123 , our guide says ' fifteen years ago if you told me this was @entity124 , i 'd think it had been photoshopped			0
' money talks in this city ; high rise luxury apartments and resorts are popping up like unruly creepers			0
the infinity pool at @entity134 in @entity124 , a beautiful cluster of villas with its own herd of goats and onsite cheese and yoghurt making @entity141 and the @entity142 have stayed at @entity143 in the infamously flambouyant royal suite			0
now in low season there are cranes and building works dot the horizon			0
we stay at @entity134 , a beautiful cluster of villas with its own herd of goats			0
it is luxurious in its simplicity			0
there is a room here devoted to @entity160 and old @entity86 with paintings and trinkets from before the nineties when communism shut down – and in homage to simpler times , the owners make their own cheese and yoghurt			2
but then there 's the pool			0
' i 've never been in an infinity pool before , ' says mum			0
' what happens if you swim over the edge ? ' in the morning , @entity123 takes us to the wine cellar where we all drink brandy at 9am			0
apparently it thins the blood , so it 's health - ­ giving in a sense			2
i 'm not convinced , but it tastes great			0
the £ 220 million @entity40 – baby of @entity64 gold ­ miner @entity65 , calls itself the @entity69 's first megayacht marina @entity40 , where @entity190 up to 80 - foot long and megayachts over 164 - foot long more in the berths of former warships book your @entity40 through tour operator explore @entity40			1
flights depart from @entity197 into @entity60 three times a week with @entity199			1
car hire is recommended and available from @entity201 for pick up or delivery with @entity204 experience @entity36 with @entity206 or stay at the @entity207 or head to the @entity209 and stay at @entity134			0
for more information about @entity40 visit the @entity211 food in @entity40 was traditionally divided by wealth , with the poorer north accompanying every meal with bread , cheese and meat			1
on the coast , fish and seafood rule , with specialities including black risotto			0
wine is good here , too , especially if you ca n't stomach the endless shots of grappa			0
we visit @entity83 , something of a staple for tourists to @entity40 - a tiny islet consumed by one single hotel resort , @entity232			1
once , the summer resident of the @entity235 , it became an @entity69 playground for the rich and famous in the 1960s and 1970s , but the break - up of @entity86 saw its decline			1
after a painstaking refurbishment which saw each of the original bricks that were removed , returned to their original position , the beautiful site is now a five - star franchise hotel owned by the @entity246 , with 58 rooms , cottages and suites , and high profile guests such as @entity251			1
workers relax of @entity254 beaches , were in high season tourists pay through the nose for a beach package , including towels and an umbrella			2
meanwhile , over on the banks of @entity36 the water is so tranquil it looks like it 's been ironed			0
my mother and i sit outside the @entity267 cafe			0
old men sit with their coffee and cigarettes , reading the local rag			0
once a military factory , @entity40 now has a nightclub , three tennis courts , five lavish restaurants , lido swimming pool and 45 shops @entity254 beach : in high season , tourists flock to this beach and pay through the nose to hire umbrellas and towels for the day within the old city walls : the home of @entity1 is the last inhabited home in the mountains overlooking @entity22 old town @entity289 , the owner tells me : ' we do n't go into town , we stay here where it is slow and quiet			1
' later , we hike up to the fortress walls overlooking the @entity22 fjord			0
this was once the was once safest place to live in @entity40 , now @entity1 's house and the crumbled remains of the village of @entity301 are all that is left			1
the fabric of @entity40 is changing , each stitch taking it further from the simple @entity305 holiday destination it once was			1
now , for the heavy - pocketed there is almost too much			2
but for everyone else , there 's enticing , beautiful greenery ; including four national parks and @entity313 's last remaining rainforest ; sumptuous food ; and a truly fascinating history .			1

@entity69 beauty spot has *reinvented* itself as a five - star holiday destination for super wealthy yacht owners
in @entity60 , the 287 million euro @entity40 , 80 - foot megayachts moor for up to £ 40,000 per year
but there is plenty for everyone with four national parks , peaceful lakes , *glorious* beaches and a fascinating history
