owners of curious pets might suspect that their animals have a sixth sense when they seem to be ' spooked ' by nothing at all			0
but now scientists might have gone some way to explaining their strange behaviour as they have said that cats and dogs have ultraviolet vision – so they can see things that humans ca n’t			1
however , experts are not sure why the animals need the capability			2
@entity16 eyes : scientists have said that cats and dogs can see in ultraviolet ¿ so they can see things that humans ca n't - but experts are not sure why the animals need the capability scientists are not sure why some animals can see ultraviolet light and others ca n't			1
it is thought that some use it to see in the dark as well as spotting potential mates or predators			0
reindeer for example see uv light and it helps them spot polar bears that appear to be incredibly well camouflaged in white snow			0
bees and other insects use their @entity43 vision to see colours and patterns on plants			1
rodents use it to follow trails of urine , but they are not sure what pets use it for			0
experts also question why human eyes filter out uv light			0
some think it could be to protect the delicate retina , but other animals that live for a long time and see @entity43 do not have damaged eyes			1
other scientists consider that the human eye is best suited to seeing detailed images in low levels of light , whereas other creatures that see uv tend to see in less detail			0
@entity70 researchers found that a whole plethora of mammals , including hedgehogs and ferrets can see in uv , giving them a better view at night among other benefits			1
it was previously thought that only a handful of mammals could see ultraviolet light , but the new study could help scientists shed some light on why pets behave the way they do			1
@entity86 , a biologist at @entity87 , in @entity85 told @entity88 : ‘ nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet , but in fact , they do			1
’ light is made up of a spectrum of colours and humans can see from red to violet , whereas many animals , such as bees , fish , reptiles and amphibians can see ultraviolet wavelengths invisible to humans			2
a number of mammals including bats , reindeer and some mice and moles are already known to see in ultraviolet , but scientists are not sure why some animals have it and others , as well as humans , do not			1
the lens of the human eye blocks ultraviolet light , but in some animals uv can reach the retina and the light is converted into nerve signals , which travel to the brain and are processed			2
scientists think that the uv filter in the human eye means that we can see more accurately than without it			0
humans can see in such detail because we have dense colour - sensitive cells ( cones ) in the retina ( pictured ) that convert light to create detailed images in dim conditions to explore which animals possess the capability to see ultraviolet light , the researchers obtained eyes from a wide array of mammals that had died in zoos , vets , science labs or slaughterhouses			1
they measured how much light got through each animal ’s eye to the retina			0
scientists found that many of the animals , including cats , dogs , hedgehogs , ferrets and okapi , have lenses that let some ultraviolet light though , suggesting that they can see well in the dark			1
scientists already know that bees and other insects use their @entity43 vision to see colours and patterns on plants , while rodents use it to follow trails of urine , but they are not sure what pets use it for			1
‘ the question is only being asked because humans ca n't see it , ’ dr @entity86 said			2
to explore which animals possess the capability to see ultraviolet light , the researchers obtained eyes from a wide array of mammals , including dogs and hedgehogs , that had died in zoos , vets , science labs or slaughterhouses he is interested in why the human eye blocks uv light and while some scientists think it could be to protect the retina from damage , many animals that live for long periods of time and are active in the daytime , can see ultraviolet light and ‘ their eyes do n’t fall apart ’			1
other scientists think that the uv filter in the human eye means that we can see more accurately than without it			0
they found that animals that also block this part of the spectrum have the highest resolution vision			2
humans can see in such detail because we have dense colour - sensitive cells ( cones ) in the retina that create detailed images in low levels of light , but nocturnal creatures have eyes that let in as much light a possible , including uv , but do not enjoy the same level of detail			1
birds can see uv light , which means that the ' eye ' markings in a peacock 's tail features looks sharper scientists have long been fascinated by the colour vision of animals and what they see when they look at us			0
a lot of animals , such as birds see ultraviolet so a peacock looking at a potential mate would not see the rainbow of colours like humans , but a plainer , yet vivid display of plumage			2
animal colouration provides some of the most striking examples of evolution by natural and sexual selection			0
but animal colours did not evolve for our benefit ; the impressive array of animal colours that we see ( and ca n’t see ) in the natural world allows animals to communicate with each other , to attract mates and to avoid predators			0
because animal colours evolved for the benefit of animal - and not human - eyes , understanding the visual world from an animal ’s point of view can explain why some animals are bright while others are dull			2
some are highly patterned and others plain			0
this allows scientists not only to shed exciting new light on the animal colours we can see , but also to understand the importance of colours that they ca n’t .			0

@entity70 researchers found that a *variety* of mammals , including hedgehogs and ferrets can see in ultraviolet - more than previously thought
biologists at @entity87 said the finding might explain why creatures act the way they do
experts are *unsure* why some animals have @entity43 vision and humans do n't
