by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 06:40 est , 17 august 2012 a floating robot has been deployed to track great white sharks in the @entity3 as part of efforts to understand the giant predators			1
the ' wave glider ' , which from above looks like a yellow surfboard , picks up signals from tagged fish up to 1,000 feet away in the ocean and then sends their positions to researchers via a satellite transmitter			1
the location of sharks are relayed to researchers via a special @entity18 app , and they can also see maps and even video from the glider scientists have only a hazy understanding of where great white sharks , portrayed as ferocious killers in films like ' @entity28 ' , swim in the oceans			1
the new robot will give insights into their movements , they say			1
' here we are in the 21st century and scientists have just put a rover on @entity35 , ' said @entity36 , a marine sciences professor at @entity37 in @entity38 in charge of the project			0
researchers @entity41 & @entity42 examine the waver rider robot , which can track nearby sharks and sent the results to an @entity18 ' and we do n't understand what is going on in the oceans , ' ' we will send a wave glider out to follow the sharks			1
' in one eight - day test , the glider , made by @entity38 - based @entity51 and which moves at less than walking speed , made 200 detections of 19 individual sharks			2
@entity51 on the water , with its solar panels and communication mast			0
it can roam the seas looking for great white sharks to track the glider , about 7 feet long with solar panels above and a wave - power system below , could also give clues to other tagged creatures ranging from mako sharks to tuna and salmon			1
it can only notice creatures that have been previously tagged by scientists with tiny battery - powered acoustic transmitters that bleep once every two minutes			2
thousands of creatures carry the tags , @entity36 said			0
the glider , and listening buoys in fixed positions chained to the seabed , are building on a previous project for the tagging of @entity3 predators , which was part of an international census of marine life from 2000 - 10			0
fixed bouys with solar panels are also used to listen for sharks @entity36 said that scientists already knew that great white sharks wandered across the @entity3 from @entity91 , often all the way to @entity93			1
there were also mysterious gatherings , including in one mid-ocean area dubbed the ' white shark cafe '			0
unlike the fixed buoys , the gliders can monitor such ' ocean wi - fi hotspots '			0
the researchers are setting up an app , ' @entity103 ' allowing people to track the fish			0
@entity36 hopes to extend the ocean observing network down the west coast of the @entity109 , likening the region to a ' blue @entity111 ' as rich in wildlife as @entity113 or @entity114			0
the glider is lowered into the sea , where it searches our signals from nearby tagged sharks			2

floating robot can spot sharks who have been *electronically* tagged
researchers use a special @entity18 to view great white *'s* movements
