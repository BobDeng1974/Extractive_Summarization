by @entity1 reporter published : 07:57 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 18:28 est , 11 april 2013 @entity3 imported from some countries , including @entity5 , contains high levels of lead that could pose a health risk to children , researchers have claimed @entity3 imported from some countries contains high levels of lead that could pose a health risk to children , researchers have claimed			1
@entity14 experts detected concentrations of lead ranging from six to 12 milligrams per kilogram in rice from several sources			1
the highest amounts were seen in rice originating from @entity5 and @entity20			2
significantly high levels were also found in samples from the @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
all these countries export rice to the @entity30			2
infants and children consuming the rice would be exposed to lead levels 30 to 60 times higher than the tolerable safety limits set by the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , said the study authors			1
for @entity40 children , who consume more rice , exposures could be up to 120 times higher			1
for adults , daily exposure levels were 20 to 40 times higher than the @entity36 guidelines			0
' such findings present a situation that is particularly worrisome given that infants and children are especially vulnerable to the effects of lead poisoning , ' said study leader dr @entity49 , from @entity50 in @entity51			1
the findings were presented yesterday at the annual meeting of the @entity53 in @entity54			0
the researchers are still in the process of analysing rice samples from @entity58 , @entity59 and other countries			2
lead accumulates slowly in the body , and can lead to nerve and kidney damage , as well as anaemia			2
one study has shown brain shrinkage in workers exposed to lead through their occupations			2
long - term lead exposure has been linked to reduced iq and disruptive behaviour in children			1
@entity3 is the staple food of around three billion people worldwide			0
because rice is grown in heavily irrigated conditions , it is more susceptible than other staple crops to environmental pollutants in irrigation water			0
health fears : @entity40 children , who eat twice as much rice on average , are most at risk in the @entity30 , the average person consumes around 5.6 kilograms of rice per year			1
consumption in the @entity30 is expected to increase as the ethnic population expands and food tastes diversify			0
rice imports account for only about 7 % of the rice consumed in the @entity14 , which is a major producer and exporter of the grain			0
lead contamination results from the take - up of metals and other pollutants found in the soil			0
it is one of several toxins which is known to have been found in rice in the past			0
a spokesman for the @entity107 said : ‘ we are not aware of any evidence or research which suggests that the levels of lead generally in rice are a concern			1
’ she said the @entity115 recently published a report which found that rice played only a small part in the average person ’s exposure to lead through food			1
she added : ‘ we would welcome the opportunity to review the @entity14 research			0
' however , the levels quoted are much higher than those we have detected here in the @entity127			0

@entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 rice also caused alarm
children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning
