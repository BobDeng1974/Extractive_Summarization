you might call it the vengeful act of a bitter old woman , and for two centuries it has stood : an 18th - century spinster 's demand for narrow pavements to prevent the irksome parading of young lovers arm in arm			1
the rule was put in place on the orders of @entity15 , who in the late 18th century offered to pay £ 400 for new paved public footpaths throughout the @entity19 town of @entity20			1
there was just one condition : they should be made so narrow that pedestrians had to walk in single file			1
but now , 220 years later , those narrow pavements will soon be no more as council chiefs put plans in place to pedestrianise the town 's roads - effectively scrapping its narrow walkways			1
@entity15 became the inspiration for the main character in @entity51 's novel @entity50 and who was played by actress @entity53 in the adapted @entity55 drama , @entity56			1
councillor @entity57 , @entity58 leader of @entity59 , said : ' i am all in favour of retaining our fantastic heritage , but this is one of those occasions when we can improve on the legacy of the past			1
' we want to create a space which will be enjoyed by the residents - whether they are walking arm in arm or not - while also attracting visitors and enabling businesses in the locality to thrive			0
' the shops and businesses are a great asset to @entity78 and the street merits and deserves enhancement works			0
' just what @entity15 , who was the daughter of the 11th @entity36 , would have thought of the scheme is impossible to say			1
she lived in @entity84 in @entity20 until her death in 1803 when she was reputed to be in her 80s and was a benefactor to the town after paying £ 400 to have the pavements laid			1
in her book ' @entity20 : a history ' , author @entity91 said : ' she did not approve of linking couples walking arm in arm , so stipulated that it should only be wide enough for one			0
' a group of men stand on @entity99 in @entity20 in 1861 where the narrow pavements were laid to stop people walking along arm - in - arm the council kept the thin walkways for more than 220 years , but now they are planning to widen them a history of the town records say that at least one countryman , who got in her way while she was out walking , received a firm tap from @entity15 's gold - headed cane , accompanied with the words : ' take that fellow ! ' but she often avoided confrontations on @entity20 's narrow pavements by taking to her sedan chair , which can still be seen in the town 's heritage centre			1
the book continued : ' she paraded with her gold - knobbed cane which she used to reprimand those who impeded her progress			0
her sedan chair makes an annual appearance at the @entity126			0
' in the book ' @entity51 : @entity129 ' by @entity130 in 1910 it said : ' @entity15 was beloved by her household , and admired by the whole neighbourhood ; but she had very strict notions of propriety and of the courtesies of life , and would not have them infringed			1
' it is also said that @entity15 , of whom there is only believed to be one portrait , also suggested as her own epitaph : ' a maid i lived and a maid i died ; i never was asked and never denied			2
' lady @entity15 was the daughter of the 11th @entity36 and was said to be an eccentric character , who remained single throughout her life			1
she was carried through the town in a sedan chair because in those days there were no footpaths and she complained the hard stone cobbles caused her discomfort			0
when she died she left a sum of money to provide a footpath , but because she disapproved of seeing young people walking arm - in - arm , she demanded that the footpath should be the width of a ' single flag '			2
that way it would only be wide enough for one person to walk along and would not encourage the common form of courting , which she frowned upon			2
as a result , the woman would occupy the pavement while the suitor had to either walk behind her or pick their way through the gutter			2
the sedan chair , used by @entity174 , was built in 1769 , left			0
it has since been used in the town 's annual @entity177 celebrations , right is a young girl standing by the sedan chair in 1913 one of the road 's in the town , @entity183 , was renamed @entity184 after funds from @entity15 's pot were used to plant trees along the side of the heath			2
while this was going on , author - in - the - making , @entity51 was growing up in the town - and it later became the inspiration for her novel @entity195 , published in 1851			1
@entity51 went on to write @entity50 , who she revealed was inspired by @entity174 , which recounts the daily lives of the widowed @entity199 of @entity200 and the spinster @entity202 , whose father was a @entity204			2
the books were adapted by the @entity55 for a television series in 2007 and combines characters from both novels , starring @entity209 and with @entity15 played by actress @entity53			1
@entity15 's sedan chair , built in 1769 , can still be seen at the town 's heritage centre and is showcased every year in the @entity214 celebrations			2
some years ago it was urgently in need of restoration after parts of the frame had rotted , the fabric lining was in poor condition and the front window pane broken			2
it was relined with cotton chintz , woven to match the original pattern , and a piece of the original lining is preserved in the heritage centre			0
@entity51 wrote @entity195 in 1849 and the story focuses mainly on the fictional @entity19 town 's single and widowed middle class female inhabitants			1
along with two other novellas @entity50 , and mr @entity236 's confessions , it was developed into a @entity55 series @entity56 in 2007 and also starred dame @entity209 as @entity238			1
mrs @entity51 once wrote in a letter : ' the character of my @entity50 at once suggests the @entity243 mrs @entity242 in @entity195 , and it is interesting to know that they were both founded on the same original ' @entity174 ' who lived at @entity84 , @entity20			1
the street as it is now , is open to traffic and people are forced to walk along a tiny strip of paving stones the plans for the road will mean that it will be completely pedestrianised and people can walk hand - in - hand ' @entity15 was beloved by her household , and admired by the whole neighbourhood ; but she had very strict notions of propriety and of the courtesies of life , and would not have them infringed			1
' @entity59 has drawn up a design concept to upgrade the street with wider pavements and higher quality materials			1
it says the changes are intended to transform @entity99 into a ' more vibrant public space and improve access for people whose mobility is impaired , while retaining vehicular access at all times and as much on - street parking as possible			2
' @entity274 , chairman of the town centre working group in the @entity276 said : ' after several years of hard work , and unparalleled engagement by the town plan , this is a real opportunity for @entity20 to get the high street it deserves - now is the time to get it right for everyone			0
' @entity20 might be best known for its service station but it has a history dating back until 1086 it is perhaps best known for its motorway service station , but @entity20 has history that dates back as far as the beginning of the last millennium			0
situated 14 miles from @entity296 , the town was recorded in @entity298 's @entity297 of 1086 as @entity299 , after former @entity301 - @entity300			0
he is said to have forded the @entity303 , which runs through the town and is believed to be the smallest river in @entity306			0
the town celebrates an annual @entity177 celebration , which observes the custom of ' sanding the streets '			0
this is where the pavements are decorated with coloured sand and pictures			0
it is said to derive from tradition by @entity300 , that while he was fording the river he threw sand from his shoes into the path of a wedding party - wishing the newlyweds as many children as the grains of sand at their feet			0
the town is said to be a reasonably residential affluent area in ' @entity19 's @entity330 ' , which include @entity331 and @entity332 , with house prices ranging from £ 79,000 to £ 3,850,000			0
in 2005 @entity20 was named as the most expensive town to buy a house in @entity336 , followed by nearby town @entity337			0
and it 's home to celebrities including comedian @entity341 , actress @entity342 and singer @entity343			0
it is also where the @entity346 parliamentary constituency originated from , after it was named after @entity347 , owned by the @entity349 family .			0

lady @entity15 offered to pay £ 400 for new pavements in *hometown*
condition was that people must walk in single file as she hated affection
@entity59 stood by her wishes for 220 years but now paths will be widened
it comes after several complaints from shoppers that they are *awkward*
@entity15 was inspiration for @entity50 in novel and series @entity195
