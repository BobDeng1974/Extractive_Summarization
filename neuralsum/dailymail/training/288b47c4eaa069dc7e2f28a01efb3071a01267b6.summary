the couple have a daughter , aged 14 , and the care and support of her is captain @entity1 ’s main concern at this sensitive time			2
it is not clear whether the romance was responsible for the breakdown of his marriage , but friends of @entity22 claim the couple have been openly living together at her home in @entity23 for the past few months			1

’ captain @entity1 , an @entity72 gold medallist in three - day eventing , met @entity22 through his work as trainer of the @entity15 eventing team			2
he lives in @entity15 for several months of the year			1
she bears an uncanny resemblance to his second wife when she was younger and shares his passion for horses – a love he has passed down to his daughter , @entity12 , who has hopes of making this summer ’s @entity86 eventing team			1
captain @entity1 has even met his new partner ’s parents , @entity87 , 70 , and his 68 - year - old wife @entity88 , several times			1
since leaving the military @entity1 , pictured competing at the @entity92 in 1976 , has spent his life in the world of equestrianism - so it is little wonder that it is through his love of horses that he met the women in his life			2

the couple married in 1997			0

they are said to have found him immensely likeable – which is not entirely surprising , as they are clearly far closer to him in age			0
a relative of @entity22 , who did not want to be named , said yesterday : ‘ @entity142 and @entity88 are quite old fashioned and , i suspect , would not have approved of their daughter seeing a married man			0
but i know they have met @entity1 many times when in @entity23 and do like him			0
‘ other people in the family knew she was seeing @entity1 and of course everyone was aware of who he was and his royal connections			0
’ another friend added : ‘ it was pretty much well known among the equestrian community there that @entity1 and @entity14 were an item			1
they did not really try to hide it in the last couple of months , but were still very careful not to be seen to be photographed together or holding hands			0
they were always very discreet			0
’ miss @entity14 ’s £ 300,000 home is situated on the exclusive @entity165 and @entity166 , a sprawling development of gated communities in @entity169 , @entity23 that boasts its own equestrian facilities as well as an 18 - hole golf course			1
@entity172 , a former neighbour , said she would often see capt @entity1 ’s silver @entity173 parked in the driveway of the three bedroom home – even though he would ostensibly stay in a rented house on the same development while working in @entity169 , known as the equestrian capital of the @entity15			1
‘ he was always very friendly and we loved his accent			0
i had no idea he was from the @entity184			0
' we just thought he was part of the horsey set that live all around here			0
' that is neat to know that he was related to the @entity11 , ’ she said			0
miss @entity14 sold her home in march this year and the couple are now said to be looking for a property in the area to buy together			1
there was no sign of mrs @entity12 yesterday at the family farm in @entity19 , near @entity196 , @entity20 , and a member of staff said she did not wish to comment			0
captain @entity1 was divorced by @entity110 in 1992 after it was confirmed he had fathered a child outside of the marriage			0
he married @entity126 - born @entity125 in 1997			0
