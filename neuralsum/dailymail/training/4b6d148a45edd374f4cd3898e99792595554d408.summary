with the transfer window open , it is crazy season in the @entity3			1
the new year means new beginnings and managers are scrambling around to find the man to improve their fortunes			2
@entity8 was the icing on the cake at @entity11 , while @entity12 looks relieved after finally landing @entity13			2
teams want to spend big money on proper players and if i were a manager , i would want @entity18 in my side			1
he has all the qualities to become the next big thing			2
when he scored a hat - trick in his first @entity26 start last season , people sat up and took notice			1
regular @entity3 action followed , as did performances for @entity31 and a call - up to @entity34 ’s senior squad			1
@entity26 striker @entity18 has been linked with the likes of @entity36 and @entity37 @entity18 has been likened to former @entity39 striker @entity38 by @entity41 's @entity40 @entity8 and @entity13 sealed moves to @entity11 and @entity43 respectively i am surprised that more was not made of @entity47 ’s cowardly push on @entity48			1
the @entity50 man shoved @entity48 while he was in mid-air and now @entity39 ’s right back is out for three months with a dislocated shoulder after he crashed into an advertising hoarding			2
on tuesday when @entity58 ’s @entity57 shoved @entity59 , the @entity56 defender was lucky to escape injury			2
it is a cheap shot , it shows no respect for your opponent or their safety and as a former pro it really riles me			2
i fractured my shoulder playing against @entity69 when somebody shoved me when i was already falling			2
it leaves you no time to brace yourself			2
@entity73 was shoved into @entity74 while playing for @entity31 against @entity75			1
he broke his jaw and missed @entity77			0
it can look innocuous , but it ’s a deliberate act and must stop			0
if you hit the hoarding , it ’s like being shoved into a brick wall			0
@entity39 defender @entity48 has been ruled out for three months with a shoulder injury but despite his talent , there have always been question marks over his conduct off the pitch			0
that culminated in him being banned for 12 months for drink - driving after pleading guilty			0
that is a real disappointment and until recently it seemed he was struggling to find the right balance in his life			0
it is not easy for young men to deal with overnight success and that ban means any clubs looking at signing him may tread more carefully			0
i have , however , seen improvements in recent weeks and there is certainly no problem on the pitch			0
after a fast start last season he suffered a bit of a dip but , despite a barren autumn , he already has six goals in three games in 2015 and is playing with a real swagger			1
his confidence has improved and in each game he is expressing himself more and more			0
he looks like the real deal			0
@entity18 has great technical qualities but it is the flashes of imagination that are impressing me			1
whether it is an outside - of - the - foot pass , a subtle flick or an improvised finish , he is showing there is more under the bonnet each week			0
his ability to score all types of goals reminds me of @entity38			1
he loves to open his body up and curl a finish into the corner but he can hit them with either foot and is good in the air			0
importantly for a young striker , he is very calm in front of goal , too			0
but of all the positions on the pitch , it is often the strikers who have an edge			0
@entity146 is the league ’s most well - balanced forward , physically and mentally , but a lot of top strikers come with a warning label			0
@entity151 caused @entity36 so many problems but would they take him back at @entity153 ? of course they would			1
@entity26 manager @entity155 will be desperate to keep hold of star striker @entity18 when a player shows talent , sometimes you have to take the gamble and invest in the whole package			1
@entity36 are just one of the clubs looking at @entity18 and after the @entity165 experiment failed , they will look at any future transfers closely			1
but @entity18 is a totally different proposition			1
many of his problems are in the past and i have seen increasing signs of maturity			0
after scoring the winner against @entity177 , his first thoughts after the game were for his team			0
he talked about the importance of defending well and keeping a clean sheet			1
you want youngsters to be team players and that is what @entity18 is becoming			1
that is why @entity155 should not let him go			1
if a huge offer comes in , it may be out of his hands but @entity18 ’s goals can be the difference between @entity26 staying up or going down			1
if he stays until the summer , at least he can try to keep his side in the top flight and he would leave with an enhanced reputation and even bigger price tag .			0
