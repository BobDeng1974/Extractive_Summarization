acclaimed @entity1 political historian @entity0 has urged @entity2 to show some guts and take on @entity4			1
he challenges @entity2 to ' be more courageous , like @entity5 ' and covet the leadership of the party and country			1
day has penned his latest instalment on the country 's ' most important @entity11 prime ministers ' , " @entity16 " , and told @entity13 that @entity2 should take a leaf out of @entity5 's book			1
political historian @entity0 has urged @entity2 ( left ) to show some guts and take on @entity4			1
he said he should ' be more courageous , like @entity5 ' and covet the leadership of his party @entity2 should look to history , says @entity0 , and take on @entity4			1
' @entity5 tried and failed but six months later it paid off ' @entity5 ( left ) is the subject of @entity0 's most recent political account			1
he lost his first party room ballot against @entity25 ( right ) but six months later would succeed ' he ( @entity5 ) knew his first challenge ( against @entity25 ) was a big risk but he took it , he was a courageous politician on several fronts , and it showed then , ' day said			1
' @entity2 should look to that sort of history , @entity5 tried and failed			1
. but six months later it paid off			0
' indeed , @entity5 put his political career on the line when he challenged @entity25 in june of 1991			1
he was soundly defeated in the party room ballot and took his place on the backbench			0
six months later though , it was a far different story			0
the man , who had left school at age 14 , took over as @entity42 just a week before @entity43 , when he defeated @entity44 in a second tilt			0
but while the former @entity42 refused @entity0 's invitation to play a part in his new book , @entity0 is a fan			2
' i take several legacies out of his time in @entity1 politics , ' he said			0
' he opened up @entity1 to the world , he had mostly impressive years as treasurer , put the republic on the agenda and @entity57 was perhaps the most important policy on a practical level			0
' ' yes he was a divisive figure but i admire many of the things he did			2
' indeed , @entity0 does not resile from his belief that @entity5 may have suffered dyslexia , a claim to which the former @entity42 took no shortage of umbrage			2
he wrote a letter to the @entity69 on that score saying , in part : ' this is completely untrue			0
' @entity0 says @entity5 's speeches ' were memorable '			1
here the former @entity1 prime minister is pictured in 1992 as he prepares to speak at @entity74 in @entity75 , to mark the @entity76 of the @entity78 's @entity77 @entity2 has been urged to take on @entity4 by political historian @entity0 ( right ) the moment which led to then pm @entity5 being labelled ' the @entity81 ' by the @entity83 media , as he places a hand on the back of @entity86 during her tour of @entity1 in 1992			1
@entity0 says it was a non-issue for most australians @entity5 also took him to task on his marital status			2
' day 's book is full of inaccuracies , including that i divorced my wife - which i have not , ' he wrote			2
the author told @entity13 : ' i will take his word on the divorce but on the question of dyslexia , i stand by it			0
' ' he obviously took it badly , in that perhaps it suggests you are a moron but that is not the case at all			0
' @entity109 and @entity110 both were ( dyslexic ) and the description of someone who is , fits him ( @entity113 ) to a tee			2
' just his behaviour , in the way he got his knowledge and how he got his information			0
for a long time nothing was known about it all but it 's not a disability and it helps to explain how he operated , how he could see th ebig picture and how he was able to scane documents and get a gist faster than others			0
' @entity5 did not assist day with the book and says there are several inaccuracies in the account			2
' i tried several times to speak with him but he just said no , he did not want to be involved in the writing of it			0
' but that did not diminish his respect for the former @entity11 leader			0
' @entity5 had been treasurer for nearly nine years , he transformed @entity1 's economy it 's fair to say but he wanted the top job , ' @entity0 added			1
' he truly wanted @entity1 to be proud of their country and wanted to lead those changes			0
. and he did so			0
' the former @entity42 is pictured as he arrives for the funeral of former @entity11 deputy leader @entity145 in @entity75 earlier this month			0
he has refuted claims by writer @entity0 that he suffered dyslexia @entity4 ( seated ) beat @entity2 42 votes to 41 to take over the @entity150 leadership in 2009			1
@entity0 has urged the communications minister to show courage and challenge for the top job again even the hand on the @entity86 's back incident was a non-issue , according to the author			1
' i do n't think it meant anything to @entity1 , it was not a concern for them at all , if anything it just made him seem more human , it was just about the @entity168 reaction , where they went over-the - top calling him " the @entity81 " all that			0
' ' his was a formidable ( political ) career and his speeches were memorable , ' @entity0 said			2
' this book was particularly gruelling for me , so that delayed the writing of it but i found that there are very different opinions about him			0
' ' @entity177 said , ' was always a reluctant convert to the ascendancy ( as leader ) of @entity25			2
day recounts how @entity5 made no secret of , and continues to , the belief he did much of the hard graft for the @entity183 in the mid-eighties , after the then @entity42 's daughter @entity185 was ' found to be addicted to heroin '			2
' it 's a sign of their close relationship that @entity5 is the one minister in whom @entity44 confides , ' wrote day , while noting , it also changed their relationship for the worse			1
' @entity5 's speeches were memorable '			2
@entity0 , despite being challenged by the ex-pm over claims in the new book , remains a fan of someone he called ' a divisive figure ' prime ministers of the time			1
then @entity83 leader sir @entity200 greets @entity5 ' according to @entity5 , the shock wrought on @entity44 destroys his confidence to such an extent that he takes years to recover , leaving @entity113 to carry most of the burden of government , ' according to day			1
' this leaves a power void , says @entity5 , " and i filled it "			0
not surprisingly this is roundly rejected by @entity44			0
' day has now added @entity5 's account to his ' series of six most important @entity212 ' , along with the best - sellers on @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 - with @entity25 and @entity217 still to come to complete the set			1
on whether any of the current parliamentarians will ascend to the ' most important ' list one day , the author singled out @entity222 and @entity223 as having the potential to succeed , while adding : ' i thought @entity4 would do better than he has			2
author @entity0 says @entity226 , @entity223 ( left ) and @entity227 attorney - general @entity222 ( right ) have what it takes to get to the top @entity5 shares a joke with prince @entity232			1
the former pm once famously told the @entity86 that ' @entity1 felt the monarchy was an anachronism ' @entity5 , 71 , became @entity1 's 24th prime minister , holding office for more than five years before he was toppled in the 1996 election by @entity239			1
he was treasurer for almost nine years and the floating of the @entity241 remains one of the pivotal moments of that tenure			0
@entity5 would spend almost 27 years in federal politics and @entity0 writes of that time : ' the cost of his single - minded ambition was eating away at his marriage and threatening the relationships that he held most dear			1
' ' rather than being lauded for his efforts , @entity5 was tossed from office at the 1996 election by voters who had become tired of change			0
' spurned by his own part , and with his marriage in tatters , @entity5 was left lonely and embittered as he watched some of his milestone achievements being dismantled by the new ( @entity239 ) government			0
' @entity0 's account of @entity5 's political life is the fourth in a series of six on @entity266			1
