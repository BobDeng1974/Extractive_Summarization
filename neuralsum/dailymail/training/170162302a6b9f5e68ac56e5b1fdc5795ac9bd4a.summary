by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 stressed he had had no contact with @entity5 over their managerial vacancy after saturday 's 4 - 1 win against @entity9			1
@entity2 claimed he did not know where reports linking him with @entity11 had come from , and insisted he already had an important job on his hands			2
' there has been no contact at all with @entity5 , ' he said			2
' as you can imagine , i have a serious amount of work to do here and anyone who knows me will appreciate it is important to see it through			0
staying put : @entity2 has dismissed speculation linking him with the vacant @entity5 job points secure : @entity30 scores @entity3 ' third goal against @entity9 ' the most immediate job is to get us out of this division			1
i 'm desperate to do that as quickly as possible and my short and long - term job is to do that			0
' it is flattering , and maybe @entity3 ' story coming through the divisions catches the attention , but i 'm desperately keen to get the job here completed			2
' turning to his side 's 4 - 1 win over @entity9 , @entity2 was more forthcoming			1
first - half goals from @entity46 and @entity47 set @entity3 up for another home win on the back of monday 's 8 - 1 hammering of @entity51			1
and although it was a gutsy performance from @entity9 , a second - half strike from @entity30 and an own goal from @entity55 left @entity57 's team on the wrong end of another crushing defeat - with only a @entity61 own goal for consolation			1
job to finish : @entity2 chats with striker @entity65 at the training ground celebration time : @entity46 ( no.6 ) celebrates scoring @entity3 ' opener make that four : rangers walk back to the centre circle after scoring a fourth goal , an own goal by @entity9 's @entity55 after making it two home wins in a week and scoring 12 goals in the process , the @entity3 boss was delighted to keep the momentum going			1
' i 'm absolutely happy with the performance , although a little bit annoyed we did n't keep a clean sheet , ' he said			0
' we played good football and could have scored a few more - we hit the post twice			0
' we are really pleased with the goals			0
if you are getting goals from throughout the team it is really pleasing - and losing the goal is really a bit of a moan			2
' @entity2 acknowledged there was a case for @entity61 to be sent off early in the second half for a trip on @entity98 on the edge of the box , but thought the referee got it right when he only showed a yellow card to the @entity3 defender			1
vacancy : @entity5 are searching for a permanent manager after @entity108 ' shock departure eyes on the job : but @entity2 is concentrating on taking @entity3 back to @entity111 it was not a happy return to @entity114 for former @entity115 defender @entity57 as the @entity9 boss watched his side slip to their third consecutive defeat			1
while his side stood up well , @entity57 was disappointed with the way they leaked four goals			0
' the goals are shockers , especially the first one from a set - play			0
' i said to the players at half - time that it was only 2 - 0 and we could maybe have a chance with the next goal			0
but we lose another on the break and then when it goes to 4 - 0 you get a bit worried			1
although we had a bit of luck with our goal , i thought we deserved something from the game			2
' the @entity9 manager did not want to dwell on the incident involving @entity61 and @entity98 , but accepted it might have influenced proceedings			0
' my initial reaction was that @entity98 was through and @entity61 was the last man , but i do n't want to see players sent off and maybe the ref has called it right , ' he said .			0

@entity3 boss @entity2 has *distanced* himself from *rumours* he 's in the running to take the vacant @entity5 job
*speaking* after his team *thrashed* @entity9 4 - 1 at @entity114
@entity2 said : ' there has been no contact at all with @entity5 '
@entity3 third in the @entity163 table
@entity46 , @entity47 , @entity30 and a @entity55 own goal did the damage
@entity9 boss @entity57 thought his team deserved better
