the heartless thug who kicked a squirrel into the @entity2 in a @entity4 clip has a £ 10,000 bounty on his head thanks to furious animal activists			1
@entity8 ( @entity8 ) , famous for its shock tactics and ads containing scantily clad women , are on the hunt for the man shown in the video			1
the charity pointed to notorious criminals such as @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , who all abused animals in the past , as reasons why the act should not go unpunished			0
at least one of them deserves a kicking : after luring the adorable rodent to the edge he takes aim gone : the tiny animal flies off the edge of the canyon after the man kicks it into the abyss the video shows two men in boxer shorts at the @entity2 as one of them lays out treats for the squirrel ( seen bottom right ) the video has had nearly 105,000 views and shows a shirtless man wearing boxers and a straw hat laying out breadcrumbs for a squirrel near a cliff top			1
as the squirrel gets close to the edge of the cliff one man , thought to be @entity53 , sneaks up on it and boots it off the cliff			1
@entity8 @entity59 spokesperson @entity58 said : ' it is imperative that any community faced with a sadistic and violent act such as this take measures to find the culprit or culprits and bring them to justice			1
' animal abusers are a danger to everyone - they take their issues out on whomever is available to them , human or non-human , and must be caught before they act again			0
' the reward will be paid to anyone who gives information leading to the arrest and conviction of the man responsible			1
anyone with information is encouraged to contact @entity2 chief ranger @entity83 on +1 928 - 638 - 7888			2
the 15 - second video was uploaded to @entity4 by a user claiming he was only just a witness and had no part in the evil joke			0
‘ i did not realize what was happening until it was too late , ’ @entity88 wrote in his defence			0
‘ i do not know who they are			0
all i know is that they were @entity53			2
’ danger ahead : the man walks off as the little squirrel dashes towards the treacherous trail of treats if found , the man could face a charge that falls into a category of disturbing or harassing wildlife — a federal petty offense that carries a maximum six months in jail and / or a $ 5,000 fine			1
however it is unlikely @entity107 would pursue animal cruelty under a state statute because that would require them to retrieve the squirrel and prove that it was injured or had died			2
squirrels are an everyday sight at the @entity2 and have become accustomed to visitors , climbing on their laps , begging for food and ransacking backpacks			0
park officials discourage visitors from petting or feeding wildlife because the animals can bite or attack			0
do you know the person responsible ? contact corey.charlton@mailonline.co.uk			0
