@entity2 @entity1 bosses insist that safeguards have been put in place to keep personal data safe , despite concerns from doctors and nurses health officials are to go ahead with a controversial plan to harvest the personal data of millions of @entity2 patients despite widespread concerns			1
a pilot scheme involving 265 gp surgeries and 1.7million patients will see confidential medical information put on a giant computer database , it emerged last night			0
the data , which includes childhood illnesses as well as recent conditions , will be uploaded unless a patient specifically opts out			1
the highly controversial project was meant to begin last spring but officials were forced to postpone it following opposition from senior gps and privacy campaigners			0
bosses at @entity1 insist that over the past six months they have ‘ listened carefully ’ to the concerns of doctors and patients , and put in place safeguards to prevent data falling into the wrong hands			1
but experts say the safeguards remain unclear and point out that the @entity2 has an abysmal reputation for losing patients ’ medical data			1
@entity1 , backed by health secretary @entity42 , insists the data is hugely valuable and will identify poor care and possibly help find new cures			1
critics warn it could fall into the hands of hackers – or insurance firms who will use it to drive up premiums for patients with certain conditions			1
there have been repeated complaints that information about how to opt out has been unclear			0
despite this , the pilot schemes will launch in six @entity63 local gp - led organisations – spanning @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
they will cover up to 265 surgeries and , given an average practice size of 6,500 , nearly 1.7million patients			0
unless patients specifically opt out in writing or by word of mouth to their gp , their data will be uploaded automatically			1
the information will include a patient ’s date of birth , @entity2 number and postcode – but not their name			1
however , experts say it would be very easy for hackers or private organisations to identify patients from the information stored			2
mr @entity42 has promised that the data would not be shared with insurance firms for purely commercial reasons			1
but campaigners pointed out that a number of insurers also carry out research and analysis , so could use this to obtain information which could be used it to drive up premiums			2
over the next few weeks doctors in the pilot areas will contact patients by text , email or letter alerting them to the @entity112 scheme and advising how they opt out			0
@entity1 does not yet know when the full project will begin but it is likely to be within months			1
last february – a month before the scheme was due to get under way – it called a temporary halt following fierce opposition from doctors and patients			0
critics have warned that patients ' data could fall into the hands of insurance companies , who will use it to drive up premiums , or could be accessed by hackers both the @entity131 and the @entity132 said patients had not been given enough information as to how they could opt out			1
a number of @entity136 were so opposed they automatically withdrew the thousands of patients on their books – and in so doing risking their surgeries being shut down			2
they included dr @entity142 , from @entity143 , who received a threatening letter from @entity1 informing him his actions were in breach of his contract mr @entity42 said in march that the database would be invaluable for identifying poor care and finding new treatments			1
‘ this is so important scientifically and this is going to save so many lives that it ’s really important that we carry the public with us , ’ he said			0
but the @entity2 has an appalling reputation for mislaying data			1
figures show there have been 2.1million breaches since 2011			0
these include computers containing medical records mistakenly being sold on @entity165 by hospital trusts and files being dumped in recycling bins			0
last night @entity169 of @entity170 said : ‘ if you have a mental health condition – for example depression – there is the potential for this to become public knowledge			0
' it could be hugely damaging for your reputation			0
supposing you are a woman who had an abortion – if that got out it could destroy your career or relationship			0
’ @entity186 , of the campaign group @entity188 said : ‘ the basis of the programme is unchanged – identifiable medical information will be extracted from the gp record of every man , woman and child in @entity1			1
' this this data will be centralised and made available in various forms to an open - ended array of organisations and companies for ill - defined purposes			2
‘ it ’s all very well to make promises , but patients must be able to trust those promises are true			0
@entity1 can not fudge what it says to doctors and patients , or it risks another crisis of confidence			2
we look forward to reading what @entity1 are actually proposing			2
’ @entity213 , @entity1 national director for patients and information , said : ‘ there are huge benefits to be had from this programme and this is our opportunity to make sure we get it absolutely right			2
‘ this is another step on the way to creating a more substantial picture of our nation ’s health so we can improve care for patients			0

@entity233 ' date of birth , @entity2 number and postcode to be uploaded to system
bosses at @entity1 say they have addressed concerns over data safety
critics warn cache could be accessed by insurance companies or hackers
