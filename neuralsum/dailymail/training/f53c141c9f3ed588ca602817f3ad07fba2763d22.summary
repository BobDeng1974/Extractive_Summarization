by @entity1 reporter a woman has hailed her pet dog as a ' guardian angel ' after it sniffed out a cancerous lump growing in her breast			1
@entity7 only went to see her doctor because her @entity9 , @entity10 , had been pestering her for months , sniffing and nuzzling the area where the aggressive tumour was growing			1
the 43 - year - old was sent to hospital for checks by her gp - where a scan picked up the fact she had breast cancer			1
she began a course of chemotherapy , and will have the tumour removed in an operation on monday			1
mrs @entity7 said her dog pestered her for weeks before she went to the doctor mrs @entity7 , of @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ' @entity10 was pawing me for weeks			1
' she would gently paw me as if she was trying to get something out of my left breast , but i ignored it			1
' when she stood on me in the middle of the night and would n't get off , the pain was like a thousand bee stings and the next day i felt bruised			2
' it was only when i checked the next morning that i noticed a lump but again i ignored it as i thought it was an injury			2
' mrs @entity7 , whose mother died from breast cancer nine years ago , plucked up the courage to have it checked in january			1
she was diagnosed with @entity44 - positive breast cancer and started chemotherapy			1
after she started treatment , mrs @entity7 said 18 - month - old @entity10 never bothered her owner in the same way again			1
the mother - of - two , a school midday supervisor , said : ' dogs are not just a man 's best friend , they 're a girl 's best friend too			2
who needs diamonds ? ' she 's my guardian angel			2
we bonded straight away when she was a puppy but this is just amazing			0
' i feel she was sent here just for me and she never leaves my side			0
if it had n't been for @entity10 's persistence , i would n't have gone for a check - up			0
' but that 's wrong , and i would encourage anyone who thought there was something amiss to immediately see their doctor			0
' mrs @entity7 is being treated at the @entity74			1
she added : ' the next few months will be an emotional rollercoaster , but with the love and support of my family and friends i 'll get through it			0
' mrs @entity7 said her dog was her guardian angel			1
dogs are known to have an extremely sensitive sense of smell her husband , @entity86 , 45 , who works for @entity27 and @entity87 , described his wife as " an inspiration "			0
he said : ' she has such a positive attitude and just gets on with things			0
' it 's lovely to see the bond that she has with @entity10 and , although we are going through an awful time , we know it could have been so much worse had the lump not been discovered			1
' researchers in @entity100 last year found that specially - trained dogs could detect a tumour in 71 percent of patients			2
it is thought that tumours produce chemicals , including low concentrations of alkanes and aromatic compounds , which dogs - whose sense of smell is 100,000 times better than that of humans - can detect			0
however , there is little evidence of cases of untrained domestic dogs sniffing out cancers in their owners			0
dr @entity122 , course leader for animal biology at @entity124 , said : ' they are far more attuned to us than any other species			0
' there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to say dogs have detected cancers and they are very responsive to things			0
it does n't surprise me this dog detected its owner 's cancer			2
it 's a lovely story and reinforces the overall value of animals and their companionship			0

mrs @entity7 discovered a lump after her dog kept nuzzling her breast
she has received chemotherapy and will have the tumour removed soon
