police were ordered to ' stand and observe ' rioters as they laid waste to @entity5 's streets instead of confronting them , it was claimed today			2
@entity7 insiders have revealed teams were frustrated at their inability to wade in and arrest troublemakers while they looted and burnt out shops			1
they had apparently been told to try and contain any violence but not to haul away offenders who would instead be identified through video footage later , according to @entity15			1
it was only on monday night , when the riots escalated still further , that tactics changed and armoured vehicles called @entity20 were used to disperse the crowds			1
on tuesday night , some 16,000 officers also flooded @entity5 's streets - almost triple the previous night 's deployment - and they were finally given the green light to confront the gangs			1
police are said to have complained they were ordered to go ' soft ' on rioters police on @entity30 before they were apparently given the all - clear to take tougher action the @entity33 has also come under fire for taking three days to issue any images of suspects - and then only releasing 12 grainy pictures			1
the @entity38 managed to produce another 30 with ease			0
in contrast , @entity40 were issuing images online via social network sites within hours of similar violence in their area			1
in @entity48 , police tracked down suspected rioters hours later and smashed into their homes to arrest them			0
officers mounted raids on around a dozen properties across the city and made seven arrests			1
they also recovered apparently looted items			0
the police 's tactics have led to much public criticism from residents and business owners , who are bemused at the ' soft ' approach when their livelihoods are being ruined			1
eye witnesses have told of ranks of police standing by while mobs of youths rampaged and stole from shop fronts and terrorised residents			1
however , it has been suggested that the approach may also have been dictated by the sheer scale of the problem with teams unable to spare officers to make arrests on the spot			2
there have also been calls for far more robust measures - including plastic bullets , water cannon and even the @entity83 - to quell the chaos			0
by monday night , police were using armoured vehicles and considering using baton rounds police officers in riot gear stand outside a looted sports store in @entity91 it has been suggested that the softer approach has been sparked by controversy over the death of @entity96 during the @entity98 riots and wider criticism of policing during protests			1
mr @entity96 was struck by a policeman wielding a baton during the @entity98 protests in 2009 and shoved to the ground			0
he suffered massive internal bleeding and died minutes later			0
the officer involved is now awaiting trial for manslaughter over his death			0
@entity7 was also heavily criticised in the @entity111 in april for using ' kettling ' during the @entity98 demonstrations			0
judges ruled the @entity33 had broken the law in the way it kettled 5,000 protesters because it was ' unjustified ' and an unlawful deprivation of liberty			1
@entity33 officers detaining a suspected rioter in @entity122 on tuesday night the police approach had toughened by day four of the violence in the capital deputy assistant commissioner @entity126 insists ' nobody ' gave any instruction to go soft			1
' i 'm now aware of any order to take things easy , ' he told @entity133 's radio 4 today programme			2
@entity96 before he was pushed by a police officer at the @entity98 protests he said : ' we have had this allegation made a few times			0
you have to realise we had over 3,000 officers on sunday night			2
that is the size of two small forces combined			0
it is a significant asset that we put out there			0
' we filled the cells of @entity5 on sunday and monday night , we drove @entity20 at looters - if that is taking things easy , i do n't understand that logic			2
' he admitted there were ' significant gaps ' in the police response and that they were ' enormously stretched '			0
but he insisted : ' as far as i 'm concerned @entity156 and @entity157 who led this did not give any instruction and nobody else has either			0
' on wider tactics , he said everything ' from local engagement to extreme use of force ' had been considered			2
officers trained in using baton rounds were ready if needed but there are currently no water cannon on the @entity170 mainland , he added			2
@entity172 rounds , or plastic bullets , can only be used if sanctioned by the commissioner of the @entity33 and have never been fired on the @entity170 mainland			1
they were issued to police at the @entity178 riots in @entity179 in 1985 but never used - although the weapons are apparently also issued annually for the @entity181 .			0

yard insiders : officers were ' told just to try and contain violence '
complaints by public that looting mobs were being allowed to continue
tactics finally changed on monday as armoured vehicles moved in
@entity33 took three days to issue pictures of offenders
