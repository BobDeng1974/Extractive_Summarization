this week i must admit i ’ve been feeling the january blues a tad			2
@entity2 has hit @entity3 with full freezing force and i ’m still pining after the sun , sand and sea from my trip to @entity9 a few weeks ago			1
to top it all off , my skin was really feeling the effects from soaking up all those @entity9 rays			1
so to combat my dull , dehydrated complexion , i thought i ’d treat myself to a facial at the @entity16 in @entity17			2
i wanted a treatment that would refresh and clear my skin without the downtime of a peel , so i opted for the vitamin c @entity21			2
@entity23 has been feeling a bit down in the dumps lately so treated herself to a @entity22 facial in order to perk herself and her skin up the @entity22 facial exfoliates the outer layer of the skin by gently removing dead skin cells , leaving the complexion looking radiant and rejuvenated			1
it also targets the deeper levels of the dermis to promote skin cell renewal , overall resulting in a fresher , more youthful look			2
i was lucky enough to be treated by the @entity16 ’s treatment director @entity40 , who has years of experience in skincare			0
the @entity22 facial exfoliates the outer layer of the skin by gently removing dead skin cells , leaving the complexion looking radiant and rejuvenated @entity40 began by applying a retinol serum to my face , to tighten skin and boost collagen production			1
the serum is made up of a unique blend of vitamins a , @entity53 and @entity54 , which infuse the skin with its nourishing and anti-oxidising properties			0
it also includes hyaluronic acid , to hydrate the skin and reduce the appearance of blemishes			0
after this , @entity40 applied a mixture of botanical stem cells to my face to renew and revitalise the skin , as well as gently nourishing the delicate eye area			0
while the mixture was left to penetrate the deep layers of my skin , i was treated to a pampering shoulder and scalp massage			1
it was so soothing i could almost feel myself drifting off at one point ! the treatment also helps to promote skin renewal resulting in a more youthful look finally , @entity40 massaged a clarifying serum containing brightening @entity79 extract into my skin , to leave it looking clear and refreshed			0
after a highly relaxing 45 minutes , i checked my reflection out in the mirror and was thoroughly impressed			0
my skin looked bright , clear , and as the facial ’s name promised , completely rejuvenated			1
@entity40 also prescribed me with a set of aftercare products from the @entity87 system range ( their @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity91 moisturiser ) to help me maintain my radiant glow by preventing pigmentation , dullness and breakouts			0
@entity23 says that the facial is the perfect quick fix to a flawless complexion the @entity22 facial is suitable for all ages and skin types – including dry , sensitive , mature and rosacea - prone skin – providing instant results that last for 6 - 8 weeks			1
one session costs £ 89 – book at londonpremierlaser.co.uk			0
if your lacklustre skin is in dire need of a pick - me - up – or if you ’ve got a big night out coming up and want a quick fix to a flawless complexion – i ca n’t recommend it enough ! that night i headed out to the @entity115 party with my fellow @entity117 castmates @entity40 , @entity118 and @entity119			1
@entity115 is a new holiday offering for 18 - 35 year olds that love having chilled days and lively nights whilst away			1
the bar was set up into different ‘ scenes ’ which represented some of the ultra-glam destinations on offer such as @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 and more exotic long - haul destinations like @entity133 , @entity9 and @entity134			1
binky recently returned from sunny @entity9 where she tried out the ultra-glam glitter lips trend i kept my make - up minimal as i wanted to show off my glowy visage , but discovered these amazing @entity140 at the party which completely transformed my look ! you can easily create this look for yourself in three simple steps : step 1 : @entity148 exfoliate your lips with a sugar scrub or toothbrush to get rid of any chapping or dry skin			1
this will encourage blood circulation in your lips too , making them appear plumper			0
follow up with a non-greasy lip balm like @entity159 to give your pout a super-smooth , soft finish			0
@entity23 rocking the beauty look with @entity40 ( left ) and @entity163 ( right ) who joined her on holiday step 2 : colour next it ’s time to add your base lip colour			1
opt for a product with a bold , matte finish to give the look optimum longevity			0
to recreate my vivid purple - pink look , sweep two layers of @entity176 in @entity177 over your lips			2
step 3 : @entity180 now it ’s time to get glitzy ! start by applying a slick of clear lipgloss like @entity184 in @entity185 over your pout to hold the glitter in place			0
then gently pat a glitter pigment such as @entity191 in @entity192 all over your lips with your fingertip , focusing on the middle for fuller - looking smackers			1
finally , set your glittering pout in place with a spritz of @entity200 ’ @entity201 to ensure your lips ’ll be sparkling all through the night			0
you can get all the products above from @entity205			0
stay gorgeous , @entity23 xxx			2
