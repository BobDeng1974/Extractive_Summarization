on a cold friday night , there is nothing more tempting than a takeaway			0
but not only can these dishes wreak havoc on our waistlines , they can also damage our teeth , according to a leading dentist			0

. takeaways not only wreak havoc on a person 's wasitline , they can also damage their teeth			0
dr @entity10 , a leading dentist at @entity13 's @entity12 practice , advises drinking water and flossing to keep teeth healthy @entity24 : @entity25 it 's not just dark beverages such as tea and coffee that will stain your teeth - any heavily pigmented food can lead to tooth discoloration - and curry powder is one such culprit			1
while this staple ingredient of @entity37 cuisine is n’t particularly dark , the deep pigment can stain teeth yellow over time			0
dark liquids used to flavour foods , such as soy sauce , can produce the same effect			2
so if you do eat sushi or @entity46 food , use the soy sauce sparingly			1
@entity37 and @entity46 takeaways contain curry powder and soy source , dark pigments that can stain teeth over time			1
' anything that would stain a white t - shirt is likely to stain the surface of your teeth in the same way , ' dr @entity10 says			1
eating broccoli or spinach can form a protective film over teeth dr @entity10 advises using the example of a white t - shirt : anything that would stain this is likely to stain the surface of your teeth in the same way			2
he also recommends eating an appetiser of spinach or broccoli first , as these green veggies form a protective film over teeth , making them less porous and susceptible to staining			0
opting for lighter coloured condiments such as rice vinegar or lemon is also advisable , he says			0
@entity78 : @entity79 eating lots of chewy kebab meat can overwork the jaw , leading to jawache believe it or not , the foods you eat can have a big impact on the health of the joints in your jaw			1
as a result , the tough texture of the meat used for kebabs is sometimes associated with jaw ache			2
eating a high amount of very chewy foods can overwork and overextend your jaw – leading to strains			0
‘ any time you overuse a certain set of muscles , it can lead to contracted muscles and related pain , including headaches , and toothaches over time , ' dr @entity10 explains			2
most obviously , try limiting the number of problem foods you consume and be sure to distribute the way you chew your food evenly around the mouth			0
@entity113 : @entity114 pizza and pasta are two of the most popular dishes in the @entity119 and are rarely associated with tooth decay			0
however , white pizza bases and pastas are refined carbohydrates which contain simple sugars that dissolve quickly			2
this causes a surge of acid inside the mouth and when combined with the acidity of tomatoes , can erode tooth enamel and ultimately lead to sensitivity			1
these foods also take on a gummy consistency when chewed that can allow small particles to get trapped between teeth and stick to the surface			0
flossing as part of your daily oral hygiene routine is the most effective way to remove trapped food and chewing sugar - free chewing gum can limit damage by making your mouth produce more saliva - helping to cancel out the acid in your mouth after eating or drinking			0
pizza and pasta are refined carbohydrates and contain simple sugars that dissolve quickly in the mouth			1
this causes a surge of acid which erodes tooth enamel and causes sensitivity @entity158 : @entity159 starchy foods are notorious for getting stuck in between your teeth and lodged between crevices			1
while they may not necessarily taste sweet , the starches can begin converting to sugar almost immediately through the pre-digestive process that begins in the mouth			2
processed foods are also notorious for using sugar as a preservative or flavour enhancer : ‘ sugar can come in many different forms and the batter on fish and associated sauces such as ketchup , are culprits for having a high sugar content , ' dr @entity10 said			1
while limiting sugar intake to meal times is not a cause for concern , snacking on starchy foods at regular intervals is what can cause problems			2
dr @entity10 advises rinsing your mouth with water after eating to help fight tooth decay			1
‘ this washes away trapped food , whilst the fluoride content fights against bacteria and prevents mineral loss in tooth enamel , ' he said			0
fish and chips are starchy foods that get stuck in between the teeth			1
they are converted to tooth - rotting sugar immediately through the mouth 's pre-digestive processes @entity204 : @entity205 the delicious sticky sauces and little nuts and seeds that you come across in most @entity204 dishes are very damaging to your tooth enamel			1
the small nuts and seeds tend to get stuck in between the teeth and are not easily rinsed away , so the sugars in them have longer to wear down your enamel , harming your teeth			0
to combat this , dr @entity10 advises to floss afterwards and chew sugar - free chewing gum to dislodge the food residue			1
do not brush straight after eating as this will cause the food residue to get further lodged in between the teeth and cause further damage .			0

dr @entity10 is a dentist at @entity13 's @entity12 practice
