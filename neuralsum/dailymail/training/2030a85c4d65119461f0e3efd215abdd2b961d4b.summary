by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 5:14 pm on 17th january 2012 bullied : @entity2 was picked on at school , according to her family claims that the @entity7 teenage girl who jumped in front of a bus to kill herself did so due to bullying are now being rebuffed by police			1
@entity2 , 15 , died over the holidays , and while some friends and family were certain that she was bullied , official investigators have ruled that out as the main factor in her suicide			1
instead it is now thought that her tendancy to fall hard for boys , her history of depression , and an increase on her drinking and smoking , all converged to a tragic tipping point			2
' no one had any previous signs of her being bullied , ' a source close to the case told the @entity32			0
though bullying may not have been a contributing factor to her suicidal mental state , it certainly reared its ' ugly head after her death , as commentators made scathing jokes on a @entity43 memorial page			1
one of the harshest messages , from @entity45 , played on her last name , saying : ' bus was cummin ’ @entity49 was watchin ’ oh hurry @entity51			0
' on december 27 at about 7:30pm , witnesses saw @entity2 jump in front of an oncoming city bus			1
hours before , she had posted to @entity43 : ' ... @entity55 ill die tomight crying over you			0
. ' while the national problem of bullying - and the cruel @entity43 postings post-mortum - may have had investigators initially looking into the tormentings of teenagers , other evidence points to personal problems as the biggest cause			2
she had been hospitalized in 2009 for cutting herself , but the doctor 's notes make no mention of bullying ever being an issue			0
her death came weeks after revealing posts appeared on her public @entity43 page , in which she talked about ' feeling depressed ' and asks ' what did i do to deserve this ? ' in one disturbing post on december 1 she said : ' i 'll go kill myself '			2
@entity43 abuse of @entity2 : a sick poem from @entity81 and a mocking image tribute page on @entity43 to @entity2 who jumped in front of bus clutching a suicide note taunting : facebook users continue to harass @entity2 ' through the social media site even after her death on december 6 , in what appears to be a cry for help , @entity2 posted on her @entity43 : ' when i say im ok i want that one person t look me in the eye , hug me & say no ur not ' three days earlier , the natural blonde who recently dyed her hair black , said : ' worst sat nite ever i cnt believe this is happening what did i do to deserve this			1
' she later talks about ; ' mad people are turning against me : ' ( im spending this sat nite alone in my room crying '			0
@entity2 herself did not even cite bullying in her extensive four - page suicide note			1
instead , she sounded like a sad and love - lorn girl who had just broken up with a one - time flame			0
in the note , she confessed to being the reason behind her most recent romantic failing , saying that she was sorry for coming between her crush , @entity115 , and his suspected love interest @entity116			0
she finished the letter with the haunting words : ' i do n't deserve to live ! ' funeral : mourners said an an emotional farewell to @entity2 at a packed church in @entity7 enough love to fill the world : @entity2 's family said the 15 - year - old 's only wish was to have that love returned to her			2

@entity2 , 15 , died december 27 after jumping in front of a bus
initial reports though bullying was the cause due to rude @entity43 posts
suicide note made no mention of bullies , just *despair*
history of depression , increased drinking , and bad break - ups all contributed
