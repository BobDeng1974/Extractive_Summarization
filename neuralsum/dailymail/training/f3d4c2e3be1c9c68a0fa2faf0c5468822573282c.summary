by @entity0 an award - winning food blogger has hit out at bakery chain @entity5 's cupcakes , accusing it of ' stealing ' her recipe for @entity7 and chocolate cakes and passing it off as their own			1
@entity10 used her blog , ms @entity12 , to attack the @entity14 bakers for saying they made the first official sweet and savory treat last week when she posted a recipe online in 2010			2
she claims their guide to baking the cakes ' makes no sense ' and contains identical passages to her own recipe , which was also published in her book in 2011			1
@entity10 , who goes by the name ms @entity12 online , claims bakery chain @entity25 stole her recipe for @entity7 and chocolate cupcakes proof ? : @entity10 posted this image online from the pages of her book showing the recipe for the cupcakes speaking to @entity32 , she said : ' i was a bit shocked when i saw the recipe , i thought " how can they be saying this when they know perfectly well it 's not true ? " ms @entity10 ' says that several identical passages from her recipe book appeared in @entity5 's own guide ' i have contacted my lawyers about this , but there is n't much case history in the @entity47 because i think people are afraid of taking on big corporations			1
' @entity5 's have sent me a message saying they are formulating a response , so we will see what the next step is after that			2
' they should absolutely not be allowed to get away with this			0
' if they wanted my recipe they could have just hired me , but instead they decided to run roughshod over my work for their own gain			0
' on her blog , she added : ' their recipe makes no sense			0
the ingredients and the method do not match			0
that 's what tends to happen when you copy and paste from someone else 's work , you slip up			0
' the biggest " coincidence " is that the genius who runs @entity25 came up with this quote : " the centre will either be a shock or a pleasure depending on where your @entity7 sensibilities lie ! " ' lets compare and contrast with my blog post of 2010 which says : " this ' centre ' would either be a shock , or a pleasure depending on where your @entity7 sensibilities lie "			2
' ms @entity10 said @entity5 's has no right to claim theirs as the first @entity7 cupcakes , as the brand contacted her in 2010 to make a recipe			1
she also accused @entity5 's of ' bungling ' her recipe , with online users complaining that the instructions were impossible to follow			1
in a joint statement , @entity5 's and @entity7 denied that the recipe was stolen			1
the companies said : ' ms @entity12 ’s cupcake has a vanilla sponge and cream cheese topping , while @entity5 ’s is chocolate sponge with a buttercream chocolate ganache frosting			0
' the only similarity is the use of a liquid centre that is found in over a third of @entity5 ’s range			1
this is a standard caramel recipe with some @entity7 added			2
' last week @entity5 's released the ' first ever ' @entity7 cupcakes			1
managing director @entity119 said he was ' always searching for ways to create innovative , exciting cupcakes with unusual ingredients ' ms @entity123 said @entity5 's recipe ' makes no sense ' as parts from her guide were used out of context ms @entity10 began blogging about her recipes in 2008 under the name ms @entity12 , then shot to fame by hosting an underground supper club at her north west @entity14 home			1
since then has won the @entity134 2014 and the @entity135 2013			0
many other supper clubs have now popped up in the capital and beyond , and ms @entity10 ' website plots them on a map , helping to spread the trend			1

however she was n't truly well known until 2009 , when she began hosting a supper club at her home in north west @entity14 , one of the capital 's first underground restaurants			2
