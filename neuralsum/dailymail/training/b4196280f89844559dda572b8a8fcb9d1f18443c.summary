by @entity1 reporter published : 17:33 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 17:33 est , 27 august 2012 sixteen @entity3 men and women accused of cutting people 's hair and beards are set to go on trial this week over the alleged hate crime			1
as jury selection began at a court in @entity13 on monday , the defendants were supported by a dozen women from the community , all dressed nearly identically in traditional outfits			0
the accused , most of whom are related to one another , are charged in three separate attacks on nine people , including the parents of some of the suspects			0
support : @entity3 women attending the start of the trial of 16 people accused of beard - cutting hate crime attacks jury selection : monday saw the opening of the trial , whose charges date back to last autumn the series of crimes rocked the normally quiet , pacifist @entity3 community in southeast @entity40			1
the assaults were considered especially egregious because the beard is a symbol of a man 's identity among the @entity3 , and women in the community do not cut their hair for biblical reasons			2
federal prosecutors say the attacks were revenge for a dispute between @entity54 and other @entity3 bishops after those bishops disputed the excommunication of eight families from @entity60 's breakaway group			2
authorities accused @entity60 , 66 , of being the ringleader of the assaults , although they say he was not present during any of them			0
unprecedented : the @entity3 usually sort out their disputes within the community rather than involving goverment officials charges : if found guilty of a hate crime , the 16 defendants could face many years in prison officials said conversations recorded in jail before federal charges were brought revealed that he was planning more attacks			1
@entity60 and the others face 10 counts , including obstruction , conspiracy and a federal hate crime , ' for willfully causing bodily injury because of actual and perceived religion '			1
two defendants , @entity60 and @entity87 , have filed motions arguing that the hate crime statute , which carries a possible life sentence , does not apply to intra-religious disputes and is a violation of the separation of powers			1
seven defendants , including @entity60 , have been in custody since their arrest in october			0
unusual : the defendants are said by some to belong to a breakaway cult hostile to other @entity3 defiant : those accused have repeatedly rejected plea deals with prosecutors last week , judge @entity103 ruled that prosecutors are not permitted to refer to @entity60 's community using terms that may be derogatory , like ' cult ' or ' sect , ' but they will be able to present evidence of @entity60 's sexual ' counselling ' of female members of his group even though he has not been charged with a sex crime			1
another earlier ruling allows the defence to argue that the cutting of a person 's hair or beard does not constitute bodily harm even though the @entity3 believe married men and women must abstain from cutting their hair			2
members of the @entity3 community will not be required to be sworn in before testifying because oath - taking is considered a violation of their religion			0
the judge has banned cameras and blogging from the courtroom during the trial			0
leader : @entity60 is accused of orchestrating the alleged attacks with members of his family accused : the defendants in court at a plea hearing last october			0

breakaway sect accused of cutting hair and beards of other @entity3
could face heavy prison sentences if found guilty of hate crime
