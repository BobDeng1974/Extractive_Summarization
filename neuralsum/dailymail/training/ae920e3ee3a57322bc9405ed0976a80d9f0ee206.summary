by @entity0 back pain : @entity3 ' singer @entity2 , 34 , was diagnosed with a degenerate disc in his spine in 2008 having sold half a million copies of his album @entity8 and completed a sell - out @entity10 tour , one might forgive singer @entity2 for putting his feet up			1
but he is more likely to be found hitting the gym			2
for @entity2 , though , the reason for his devotion to fitness is more than vanity			1
exercise is his way of coping with degenerative disc disease in his lower back , and the almost constant pain that has blighted his life for six years			1
despite his doctors recommending surgery , @entity2 – one fifth of vocal harmony group @entity3 – has decided against having the operation because he ’s terrified it might leave him worse off			1
instead , to keep himself motivated , he is writing a fitness blog and hopes to inspire others in the same situation to get in shape			0
@entity2 , 34 , noticed a problem in 2008 , ironically while exercising			1
‘ i felt a pop in the small of my back , then a grinding ache			1
i thought , “ i ’ve done something , ” ’ he says			0
‘ over the next few days i was getting shooting pains down the backs of my legs			0
’ he went to his gp , who sent him to a physiotherapist			0
‘ the stretching exercises helped but they did n’t fix the problem , ’ he recalls			0
he was then sent for an magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity47 ) scan , where it was discovered he was suffering from a degenerate disc in his spine			1
orthopaedic expert dr @entity51 says most people over the age of 30 will have this kind of problem with their discs – the tough , fluid - filled sacs that act as cushions , allowing the vertebral bones in the spine to move smoothly			0
disc degeneration follows a pattern			1
first , the gel centre loses water , becoming thick and fibrous			0
as a result , it loses its shock - absorbing properties			0
routine stress and strain begin to take a toll on the structures of the spine , and tears form in the outer membrane			0
as the disc weakens , it starts to collapse , and the bones of the spine compress			1
dr @entity51 , of the @entity80 , says : ‘ if the disc ruptures , the fluid can escape and press on to surrounding nerves , causing weakness in the muscles which the nerve runs to			2
pain typically radiates from the deep muscles in the back and down the legs , where the nerves run			1
’ why some people develop degenerate discs is not known but genetics are thought to play a key role			2
boyband : @entity2 , pictured centre with fellow @entity99 bandmembers @entity100 , @entity102 and @entity103 , now blogs about his fitness regime to help with the disc problem ‘ if the fibrous part of the joint is being worked and twisted all the time , it ca n’t repair itself fast enough and will burst , ’ says dr @entity51			1
‘ it can come on suddenly when exercising , but i ’ve also met people it happened to who just rolled over in bed			0
’ in 2010 , @entity2 was offered a discectomy to trim the disc , which would ease the pressure on his nerve			1
however , @entity3 had just signed their record deal			0
‘ i was told there was a one per cent risk of being left unable to walk properly , ’ he says			0
‘ i do n’t know if this was a sign but the day after i saw the doctor , i saw a man limping			0
a few weeks later i met a dj while doing a radio interview who had the operation and who had been left with a problem with his feet			2
’ instead , @entity2 has turned to exercise to strengthen the muscles around the affected area , writing a blog about his experiences called my @entity138			1
‘ i focus on exercises to strengthen my core , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve had great feedback and it ’s good to know i ’m not the only one with back problems			2
’ but the pain can get him down			2
‘ it ’s a constant thing and it can affect my mood , ’ @entity2 admits			1
sitting in one position is n’t helpful but the hours of rehearsal needed to prepare for a show also take their toll			0
‘ we ’ll rehearse for eight hours a day and i need regular breaks			0
’ dr @entity51 says that even if @entity2 chooses to have the surgery , it might not be the solution as up to one in eight patients will experience a recurrence of pain after the operation			1
‘ drop foot ’ – the complication @entity2 fears that leaves patients limping – occurs in one per cent of cases			1
‘ every time a surgeon operates on your spine , there ’s a chance something can go wrong , ’ says dr @entity51			0
he advises patients to first pursue other options such as physiotherapy , exercise and medication for pain control – and even epidural injections that can decrease the inflammation around the disc			1
‘ the right kind of exercise can be helpful , ’ he says			2
‘ you can strengthen the back muscles that support everything			2
this helps deal with the spasms in the affected muscles that cause pain			2
it ’s possible to help with these problems without surgery			0
