by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 09:44 est , 5 november 2013 key clue : @entity2 is believed to have swallowed the bunch with the intention of passing them and freeing himself later or selling them to another inmate a convict who secretly swallowed handcuff keys was busted when a full - body x-ray scan revealed they were lodged inside his chest			1
@entity16 @entity2 somehow got hold of the bunch and consumed them shortly after being sent to prison in @entity21 , @entity22 , last week			1
it was reported that he hoped to excrete them and either use them to escape next time he was cuffed or to sell to other inmates			0
but @entity29 did n't realise that bosses at @entity32 prison had recently upgraded their security and had installed a state - of - the - art x-ray machine			2
@entity36 - eyed officers soon detected a foreign body inside the convict 's stomach after he had passed through the scanner			1
on closer inspection the image , which has been released by the @entity42 , showed two tiny keys designed to open handcuffs			0
it 's still unclear how @entity29 obtained the keys , and an investigation has been launched by prison chiefs			0
@entity50 , sub-director of security at the prison , praised the recent upgrading of security at the facility			0
' before , if a person had come into the prison with something metallic like handcuff keys in their body , it would not be detected ' , he told @entity63			2
' today , thanks to this new system , we were able to detect the prohibited item ' , he added			0
hard to swallow : the criminal was only busted because full body scanners had been recently installed at the prison in @entity21			1

@entity16 @entity2 had been *jailed* in @entity21 , @entity22
he somehow *managed* to *acquire* keys and swallow them for later
newly installed body scanners *picked* up the foreign *object* in his abdomen
