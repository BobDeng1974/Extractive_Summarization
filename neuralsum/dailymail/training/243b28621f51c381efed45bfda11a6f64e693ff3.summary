sadly , this does n't translate into action : only about one in 10 report that they do it once a week			0
location matters : people in the @entity24 have the most sex , but @entity13 have the highest sex drive in the nation men and women from the @entity30 rate themselves better in the bedroom than any other region - 56per cent think they have skills , compared to a national average of 53per cent - and women have a very high opinion of themselves at 67per cent			1
