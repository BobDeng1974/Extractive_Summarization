published : 05:59 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 03:38 est , 18 march 2013 a @entity1 father plunged to his death in the @entity3 while desperately searching for his 12 - year - old son who had been killed in a fall minutes earlier			1
police believe @entity6 , who had been hiking with his son @entity7 in the snow on @entity9 , was on the phone to emergency services asking for help when he lost his footing			1
the 48 - year - old managed to tell rescuers his son had fallen out of sight down a couloir – a deep gully – but communication was cut off before he could give the location			1
an attempt to speak to him again is understood to have left rescuers able to hear only his footsteps and laboured breathing as he trudged through the snow in a frantic state on saturday			1
@entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 were involved in a tragic accident whilst walking in the @entity32 @entity31 @entity33 : the helicopter rescue of @entity6 and @entity35 who died whilst walking in @entity37 on saturday afternoon			1
the pictures show one of the victims being winched with a rescuer aboard the rescue helicopter with the @entity43 as a backdrop the bodies of the father and son were found after a photo taken of them earlier in the day was used to locate them earlier this month no fewer than 10 people - including mountaineers and off - piste skiers - died in the @entity9 area tragedy : they plunged down a mountain at @entity37 they kept calling back but went straight to answerphone – and it is believed that by then he had plunged into the same gully as @entity7			1
@entity63 were later able to contact mr @entity6 ’s wife @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66 , and , using a photograph her husband and son had sent her from the mountain earlier in the day , pinpoint their whereabouts			1
their bodies were found at 7.40am yesterday , more than 16 hours after mr @entity6 ’s call , during the fourth aerial search			1
@entity7 had fallen about 980ft			2
his father was discovered about 150ft above him			2
they were at an altitude of 5,000ft on the 15,781ft mountain			2
the area where the tragedy happened has a number of footpaths which weave in and out of the mountainside			2
@entity83 , a @entity1 mountain guide who has worked in the area for 20 years and lives 1km from the @entity43 , said trails on the north side of the valley were currently ' covered in snow '			1
he said : ' the footpaths usually do n't get that many people out at this time of year because they are much more difficult to navigate , although yesterday was a beautiful sunny day			2
' police said the pair were wearing normal walking boots on a route rarely dared in winter where crampons and proper climbing gear are essential			1
captain @entity99 of the mountain police said yesterday in the @entity32 ski resort of @entity37 : ‘ we think the man fell while he was on the phone to the police			2
we think he called immediately after his son had fallen and that he fell very shortly after			2
it all happened very quickly			2
’ a @entity109 spokesman said it was providing consular assistance to the family ‘ at this difficult time ’			2
a statement from the family issued by the @entity109 last night said : ‘ @entity6 and @entity35 were involved in a tragic accident whilst walking in the @entity31			1
the tragic pair died in the popular skiing destination of @entity37 in the @entity32 @entity3 ‘ they had flown to the @entity31 for a short weekend of adventure in the @entity37 valley			1
they were to have a half - day walking followed by a full day skiing			2
their bodies were recovered by the local mountain rescue this morning			2
‘ @entity7 was always full of life , had a really happy temperament and loved spending time with his father			2
@entity6 was fantastic at making things happen , resourceful , with a positive approach to life			1
they will both be sorely missed by friends and family alike			0
’ the pair had arrived in the @entity37 valley on saturday morning and were booked into the two - star hotel @entity138 in the nearby town of @entity140			1
according to police the area they had chosen to hike , called @entity144 , at @entity145 is a popular summer route rather than suitable for winter or early spring			1
there are steep escarpments and the path is often covered with snow and ice at this time of the year			1
captain @entity99 said : ‘ it is a dangerous , deep , snowy hike			1
it is not a route that is chosen much at this time of the year , especially without snowshoes			0
in the winter you can not see the path , it is hidden by snow			1
‘ the accident is being investigated and it will determine the circumstances of the accident , as well as the level of preparation of the hiker and his experience			0
the father and son should have had proper mountain equipment – crampons and climbing gear			1
’ it was just before 3pm on saturday when the emergency centre in @entity175 received the frantic call from mr @entity6			1
the father and son are thought to have reached a high altitude by taking the chair lift from @entity145 village to the approaches of the @entity43 , at 1400m			0
from there , they are thought to have set off on the well - known @entity144 ( @entity185 ) hike , which is hugely popular with tourists , especially in the summer months			1
@entity144 is a rocky spur from which hikers can look out towards the @entity145 and @entity191 glaciers			0
it was is on the route taken by the @entity32 who first ascended @entity9 in 1786			0
the slopes around @entity9 , the highest peak in western @entity197 , are notoriously dangerous , with scores of mountaineers , skiers and hikers dying on them every year			0
not only is the fabled ‘ @entity9 ’ 15,780 feet high , but the climbs around it are some of the most technically difficult in the world			0
despite this , it is often mistakenly claimed that people can enjoy an easy stroll up the @entity209 set off on paths every day without ice axes or crampons , let alone other basic equipment like extra food supplies and tents			1
many of the 20,000 - plus people who attempt to reach the summit each year are inexperienced or completely novice climbers			0
earlier this month no fewer than 10 people – including mountaineers and off - piste skiers – died in the @entity9 area			1
@entity224 , the sub-prefect of @entity226 , said : ‘ the man spoke in @entity228 and said he was in @entity145 in the commune of @entity140 and that his son had fallen			0
he did not say anything else			0
‘ the call was immediately transferred to the mountain police in @entity37			0
they repeatedly asked him questions			0
they could hear him and he was panicked			0
‘ he did not reply to their questions			0
and then it cut off			0
they kept trying to call him back but it went straight through to the answerphone			0
’ meanwhile police had already alerted the helicopter rescue , but the area is vast			0
three sweeps were carried out , including with infrared cameras after dark			0
on saturday evening mrs @entity249 was contacted and her help was used to direct a fourth helicopter search yesterday morning , despite high winds			0
it was then the bodies were spotted			0
mr @entity224 said : ‘ they were found 50metres apart			0
they had fallen down the very steep @entity257 over rocks and on to the glacier below			0
’ @entity260 , the mayor of @entity37 , said it was vital to take full precautions when venturing on to the mountain			0
his assistant @entity264 , a keen mountaineer , said of the route taken by mr @entity6 and his son : ‘ i have turned back in springtime before			1
it is not a winter hike			1
’ on average around 100 people a year die in similar tragedies in the @entity9 area			0
last july , three @entity1 were among nine mountaineers swept to their deaths by an avalanche on @entity279 in the @entity9 range .			0

@entity6 and @entity35 died at ' @entity282 ' in @entity283
pair had set off on hike without specialist equipment like crampons
spring thaw of snow and ice *creates* potentially lethal conditions
