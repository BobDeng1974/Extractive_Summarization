@entity0 got back to winning ways in emphatic style following some recent poor performances with a 52 - 0 thrashing of @entity5 at @entity6			1
@entity0 , who lost 36 - 13 by @entity7 last time out having also been heavily beaten by @entity8 last month , ran in seven tries with @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 ( two ) , @entity13 and @entity14 the men on the scoresheet			1
there was also a penalty try for the hosts , with @entity20 converting all seven scores as well as kicking a penalty to push @entity0 past the half - century mark			1
@entity12 scored two tries in @entity0 devastating 52 - 0 win against @entity5 for parts of the game , it was not a vintage performance from the home side but @entity31 led from the front with an impressive display , while behind the scrum @entity10 and care both sparkled			1
promoted @entity5 battled hard but once again they fell away badly in the second half			0
it was their fifth heavy defeat and it already appears likely that they must win next saturday 's home game against fellow strugglers @entity40 if they are to have any chance of avoiding relegation from the @entity43			0
@entity0 made four changes from last week 's defeat to @entity7 with one of them seeing @entity20 return at fly - half while @entity48 made his first appearance of the season			1
@entity5 had the three changes from their home defeat to @entity53 with former @entity0 , @entity54 and @entity55 , both included in the starting line - up			2
they replaced @entity58 and the injured @entity59			0
@entity60 was on the bench for the @entity62 , having been loaned out by the @entity63			0
@entity64 captain @entity31 ( right ) starred for the hosts as they swept aside @entity5 on saturday it took @entity0 just three minutes to take the lead with an superbly created try			2
from a line - out and drive , @entity11 and @entity20 combined skilfully in a pre-planned move , which gave @entity10 an easy run for the try			1
even at that early stage , it was evident it was going to be a long afternoon for the @entity5 and it came as no surprise when the home side extended their lead in the 11th minute			0
@entity31 drove forward to set up a ruck from which @entity82 burst clear to provide @entity11 with a simple try			0
@entity5 then suffered two further blows with full - back @entity85 limping off to be replaced by @entity58 before @entity20 kicked a penalty after @entity10 was late tackled by @entity88			1
that made it 17 - 0 after 22 minutes but the visitors were much more competitive in the remainder of the half and @entity0 could not make any more additions to the scoreboard			2
@entity10 ( left ) put @entity0 ahead on three minutes in what turned out to be a comfortable afternoon during that period @entity5 matched their opponents in terms of territory and possession , but were unable to take any advantage			1
the concession of penalties at almost every scrum and frequent handling errors proved to be their downfall			0
their effort deserved points and they would have had some , had they not declined a number of kickable penalties in favour of more attacking options , which came to nothing			0
after that , it was pretty much all one - way traffic as @entity0 moved up through the gears in the second half to add five more tries			0
they notched their third of the afternoon within seconds of the restart when @entity10 evaded three defenders on a 30 - metre run before providing the scoring pass for @entity12			2
@entity20 continued his 100 per cent record with the conversion and also slotted over the extras three minutes later after @entity13 went over for try number four			0
scrum - half @entity11 was also on the scoresheet for the hosts who returned to winning ways in the league skipper @entity136 and @entity11 were both replaced with half an hour to go as @entity0 temporarily relaxed with the match already won			1
the game then became disjointed and was further disrupted by a lengthy delay as @entity5 's replacement prop , @entity141 , was carried off on a stretcher			0
@entity0 got the scoreboard moving again with a penalty try after replacement @entity14 was high - tacked by @entity54 as the scrum - half raced for the line			1
@entity20 converted as @entity54 made his way to the sin - bin			0
@entity14 was not to be denied his score for long , though , as he latched on to a chip ahead from @entity10 to add @entity0 ' sixth try before @entity12 powered over to complete the rout			1
@entity20 again converted both for a match tally of 17 points .			2

@entity12 scored two tries as @entity0 thrashed @entity5
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity14 all *crossed* the *whitewash* for @entity0 , who also scored a penalty try
fly - half @entity20 kicked 17 points for the hosts
