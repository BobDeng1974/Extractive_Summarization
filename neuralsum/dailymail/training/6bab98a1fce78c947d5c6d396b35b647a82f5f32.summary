by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:54 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 05:53 est , 13 december 2013 @entity2 has been convicted of kidnapping the dog he had given away in a ' military - style ' operation with a billionaire for a father , @entity2 is perhaps used to getting what he wants			1
so when the 22 - year - old decided that giving his pedigree @entity9 to a fellow student was a mistake , he assumed money would get the animal back			1
but @entity14 refused his offer of £ 1,500 , saying @entity16 was not for sale			1
@entity2 , from @entity18 , then took the extraordinary step of dognapping the animal in the dead of night			2
his mission succeeded – but he gave himself away by documenting his movements on @entity24			2
yesterday , a judge threw out his appeal against a community sentence for the theft and imposed a suspended jail sentence			2
the saga began last december when @entity2 , whose father owns a hotel chain and has played polo with prince @entity34 , offered @entity16 for free , saying the one - year - old needed more space and a family to play with			1
he posted a picture of the dog – whose pedigree name is @entity41 – on a @entity43 website miss @entity14 , 22 , and her boyfriend @entity44 , 23 , stepped in and took @entity16 to mr @entity44 ’s family farm in the village of @entity47 , @entity48			1
but two weeks later @entity2 decided he wanted the dog back and made his £ 1,500 offer			1
it was rejected and on march 28 he drove 70 miles to the farm to kidnap @entity16			1
his tweeted updates included ‘ patience is a virtue ’ , ‘ time for a late night mission ’ and , at 5.30am , ‘ success ! ’ @entity2 , who claimed all he wanted was one last visit with the dog , was spotted clearing a 5ft fence with @entity16 before making off in his silver @entity62			1
@entity2 , 22 , gave chocolate @entity16 away after deciding he could no longer look after him the engineering student was questioned by police but refused to say what he had done with the dog			1
apparently abandoned , @entity16 was found in @entity68 , @entity69 , more than 40 miles from @entity2 ’s home in @entity71			1
representing himself at @entity73 yesterday , @entity2 said : ‘ i felt wronged when i was n’t allowed my last visit			0
i had given everything for free			0
when he was 16 , @entity76 fled from the home of his strict father , @entity78 , said to be a devout muslim , to live with his mother , @entity80 , in @entity71			2
as a teenager in @entity18 , @entity2 was surrounded by bodyguards and unable to go out with his friends			0
in 2008 , he reportedly got away from his bodyguards , hailed a taxi to @entity86 and boarded a plane to @entity88 in his school uniform			0
it was the first time he had seen his mother in nine years			0
‘ i did n’t ask for anything			0
i just wanted a visit			0
i know that what i did was wrong by taking the dog but it was the only way i was going to be able to see him			0
‘ to me he was n’t just an animal , but when i thought i was n’t going to see him again i felt i had no choice			0
i tried to negotiate but there seemed to be no way we could be civilised about it			0
’ asked why he planned the ‘ military - style operation ’ , @entity2 replied : ‘ i did n’t really think that i would make it			1
i thought i would be caught			0
’ he said his studies stopped him doing the 120 hours of voluntary work initially imposed on him by magistrates			0
‘ i am a full - time student in my second year of engineering , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t have time for community service , so i would rather have a suspended sentence or a prison sentence			0
’ but his appeal was thrown out in barely five minutes			0
@entity76 ( pictured right when he was younger ) is the son of billionaire @entity78 ( left ) giving him a six - month prison sentence , suspended for two years , judge @entity117 told him : ‘ i am sorry but i ca n’t offer you a place in prison			1
’ @entity2 was ordered to pay a further £ 450 costs on top of the £ 760 bill he ran up during the magistrates hearing in september			2
he claimed that the dog was found in @entity68 after escaping through a hole in the fence of a property he was using			0
@entity2 live - blogged his ' military - style ' operation on @entity24 @entity2 demanded pedigree chocolate labrador @entity16 was given back to him just two weeks after giving it away			1
he live - blogged his dead - of - night mission on may 27 : 11.47pm : just waiting here			2
patience is a virtue 1.47am : time for a late night mission 2.35am : no going back now 3.50am : close 4.06am : now or never 5.30am : success ! 5.31am : on the run 6.26am : snow 6.45am : no plan goes to plan			2
