by @entity1 reporter published : 18:20 est , 28 july 2012 updated : 10:58 est , 29 july 2012 @entity3 's hopes of ever winning an @entity5 medal evaporated today as she was forced to withdraw from the @entity7 marathon because of injury			1
speculation had been rife the 38 - year - old world record - holder would pull out after a foot problem flared up again and today the news was confirmed			1
it was the latest - and possibly most frustrating - setback in a long list of @entity5 disappointments for @entity3 , one of the best female distance runners ever who holds the marathon world record but has failed to win a medal in four previous games in a statement released this afternoon , @entity3 said : ' however hard today is , finally closing the door on that dream , at least i can know that i truly have tried absolutely everything			1
' anguish : @entity3 , right , breaks down and is comforted by @entity26 , left , at the end of the @entity28 after finishing 23rd at the @entity29 in 2008 ' i have been through the mill emotionally and physically the past three weeks , cried more tears than ever , vented more frustration and at the same time calmly tried every direction and avenue available to heal myself , ' @entity3 said in a statement			2
" as desperate as i was to be part of the amazing experience of the @entity7 , i do n't want to be there below my best			1
' the 38 - year - old @entity3 failed to finish the @entity41 marathon and was 23rd in @entity42 four years later after deciding to race while still recovering from a stress fracture in her thigh			1
she finished fourth in the 10,000 metres in @entity47 in 2000 and was fifth in the 5,000 in @entity48			2
she is a three - time winner of the @entity28 , and had hoped for one more big victory in the capital			0
' from the day when it was announced that @entity52 had won the bid , taking part and performing well in the @entity7 has been a major goal in my life , ' @entity3 said			1
' the goal of a fifth @entity7 in my home country , what better ? the chance to make amends to myself for bitter disappointments at the previous two @entity7			1
' she said the joint in her injured foot is ' degenerative and badly damaged ' but not the end of her career			0
' i do n't believe now that it ca n't recover and be carefully managed to allow me to still do what i love to do , ' she said			0
' unfortunately though , that is n't going to happen in one week			0
' ' however hard today is , finally closing the door on that dream , at least i can know that i truly have tried absolutely everything			1
not one day was wasted in getting treatment , scans or interventions that might help , ' she said			0
' i cross trained as hard as i could whenever i was unable to run to give myself every chance should the pain settle			0
' a statement on the @entity84 website read : ' the @entity85 and @entity84 announced this afternoon that marathon athlete @entity3 is being withdrawn from @entity87 due to medical reasons			1
' @entity3 has been suffering with a foot problem and after a fitness test on sunday it was concluded that she would not be able to race competitively to the best of her abilities			2
' @entity3 has been struggling for fitness since a degenerative foot injury flared up three weeks ago and now her battle is over			0
sources close to @entity3 had speculated last night that she would make the heart - breaking decision today			2
speaking yesterday , one said : ‘ the time to make a decision has arrived and there ’s only one decision to make , ’ said the source			0
‘ @entity3 is not fit to run at the moment			0
there will be an announcement shortly			0
’ @entity3 recently flew to @entity113 to seek help from renowned sports doctor @entity115 for osteoarthritis in her left foot in a desperate bid to get fit for the @entity7			1
world class : @entity3 has won both the @entity52 and @entity121 marathons three times the possibility of her withdrawal was floated as far back as april by @entity3 ’s lifelong friend and former @entity87 marathon colleague @entity26			1
‘ if she ’s injured she wo n’t put herself through that [ an @entity5 marathon ] again , ’ said @entity26 in the build - up to the @entity28			2
pulling out of what would be her fifth games will be agony for @entity3 who , despite winning both the @entity52 and @entity121 marathons three times and @entity135 at the @entity137 and @entity136 , has yet to win an @entity5 medal			2
the closest she has come was when she finished fourth in the 10,000m in @entity47 in 2000			0
four years later in @entity142 her race fell apart through stomach cramps brought on by anti-inflammatory drugs she had taken for a leg injury			0
@entity3 pulled out four miles from the finish and burst into tears			0
she was dogged by a stress - fracture to her leg four years ago in @entity42 and trailed home in 23rd place			0
however , her withdrawal is likely to be good news for @entity156			1
the @entity158 runner narrowly failed to make the @entity87 team despite a brilliant debut at the @entity28 , but @entity3 's foot injury has freed up a place			1
@entity84 and the @entity85 plan to nominate @entity163 as a late replacement , but approval will be required from the @entity166 and @entity167			2

the runner , 38 , has competed in four @entity7 but has never won a medal
she announced today that she had ' finally closed the door on that dream '
her replacement in the women 's marathon next sunday is likely to be scot @entity156
