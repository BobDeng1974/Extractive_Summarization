a guest at an 007 - themed swingers ' party drowned in a swimming pool after apparently downing most of a bottle of @entity6 's whiskey			1
the 35 - year - old man was one of about 30 pleasure - seekers at the ' @entity9 meets @entity11 ' event in a £ 2.5million country mansion in the @entity13			1
he is thought to have entered the pool naked with a woman he had met at the party before suddenly starting to thrash about in the water and then sinking to the bottom			1
organiser @entity20 ( left ) with friend in an image from a website that promotes the swingers ' parties the sex party was reportedly ' just getting started ' when a 35 - year - old man drowned in the swimming pool of the £ 3million gated property ( pictured is a pool at the mansion ) detectives are investigating the ' unexplained ' death and the 50ft covered pool has been sealed off while toxicology tests are carried out to check that the water is safe			1
the party was one of the regular swingers ' events put on by retired management consultant @entity42 , 66 , and his partner @entity20 , 58 , at their eight - bedroom home in @entity44 , @entity45			1
the couple , who appeared in a @entity48 series last year , say they do not run the sex parties as a business , but ask for contributions to their costs			1
the event on friday night featured 007 references including a roulette wheel , a woman covered in gold paint inspired by @entity59 and chocolate replicas of the weapon from @entity62			1
the man got into difficulties in the water just after midnight			1
the death happened at a swingers party run by @entity42 and @entity20 , pictured in the @entity48 documentary @entity69 grows up the owner of the house , who organised the sex party , said there were safety notices around the pool ' the party was really only just getting started , ' a guest told the @entity78 ' i was in the garden when a naked couple walked into the heated pool			1
she was white and in her 30s or 40s , he was black			2
' there is a steep incline in the pool , which is about 3m deep , and the guy went in deeper by himself and started whacking the water			1
i thought he was playing			2
' after a while the woman screamed and i saw the guy lying on the bottom			1
his body looked like it was moving , but then i realised it was ripples in the water			1
' revellers dragged the man out and performed cpr on him at the poolside , but he could not be revived and was pronounced dead at @entity100			2
the victim , who told other guests he was called @entity103 , was not a regular at the parties			2
he is believed to be @entity106 and from north - west @entity107			0
the woman who entered the pool with him , who was not well known by other guests , was left distraught			1
mr @entity42 said the victim had apparently ' severely dented ' a bottle of @entity6 's he brought with him before entering the pool			2
the group 's website states that there are health and safety rules for using the large indoor swimming pool the couple have been hosting sex parties at the mansion - which includes a dungeon - for 10 years he added : ' i heard a shout and ran over			1
i dived in fully clothed , pausing only to take my @entity127 out of my pocket			0
three of the guys pulled him out , with me pushing him from behind			2
they put him straight into the @entity98 position and tried to revive him			0
one of the guests was a qualified nurse			2
' i got straight on to 999			0
the call operator gave very clear instructions , which i shouted to the team performing cpr			0
we kept doing that until the ambulance arrived			0
' then the police turned up – there were about a dozen officers in total by the end of the night			0
after interviewing various people , the inspector said to me , ' this is a non-suspicious death '			0
it may well be that he had a heart attack			0
' the mansion boasts a sex dungeon , a dance room with a pole and a sauna for the ' hot - blooded sexual olympians ' who attend the parties			2
mr @entity42 and his partner decided to go ahead with a planned @entity161 - themed party on saturday night after receiving messages of support from their regular guests			1
the property features a converted attic which mr @entity42 calls the ' dungeon in the sky ' the tragedy struck in the early hours of saturday at the mansion ( pictured ) in @entity44 , north of @entity107 the mansion 's owners say the pool complies with all health and safety rules and has been inspected ' my first reaction was that having a party the following night was not going to be appropriate , ' mr @entity42 said			1
' but we had so many supportive emails and texts saying things like , ' the first thing you do if you fall off a horse is get back on it ' , and ' it was what he would have wanted '			0
' somebody said when a plane crashes into the @entity191 , you do n't stop all aviation			0
you sit down around a table and think about whether you could have done anything differently			0
' that 's what we are doing			0
the health and safety people will come over this week and we will go through what we could do better			0
' mr @entity42 said he would invite the victim 's friends and family to visit his house and set up a memorial there if they wished			0
a @entity208 spokesman said : ' an investigation is on - going at this time to establish the circumstances surrounding the man 's death , which is being treated as unexplained pending the outcome of a post-mortem			2
this is due to take place in the next few days			0
' a documentary showed pornographic films are played on a large screen during the parties and a pole has been fitted to the centre of the dancer floor the website states : ' to assist those who feel torn between eating out or frolicking , we ease the burden by feeding you to a fair standard '			0
