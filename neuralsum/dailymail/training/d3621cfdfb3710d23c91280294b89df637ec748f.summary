boys really are more competitive than girls ... but only if they come from rich families , say researchers			1
a study of 15 - year - olds found there was a gender gap in the risks they were prepared to take to make more money in a series of maths tests			2
the @entity14 youngsters were able to earn one krone if they answered a simple question correctly or three kroner if they gambled on the harder option			2
boys are from @entity19 ... the study found that among well - off participants , boys were much more aggressive than girls			1
professor @entity24 said that both biology and culture impact the results of the boys , 51 per cent chose the competitive alternative , compared with 31 per cent of the girls			1
but when the researchers , from the @entity32 in @entity33 , asked participants about their family circumstances , it became clear class was an important factor			0
the scientists found that boys from poor families were on the same level as girls from a similar background			1
but among the well - off participants boys were much more aggressive			1
professor @entity24 , of the @entity32 , @entity33 , believes if biology is the decisive factor it has consequences for politics			0
he said : ' our point is if the difference in competitiveness is a result of women being discriminated or oppressed it lends legitimacy to politics which aims to balance this difference			2
' however , if our finds primarily reflect basic biological differences the challenge becomes how to relate to this			0
' of course it is never only the one or the other			0
we believe both culture and biology are at play here			2
' a similar @entity68 study from 2007 found 73 per cent of the men were competitive , against just 35 per cent of the women			1
cultural impact : according to professor @entity24 the studies indicate a lack of competitiveness may be a reason why women do not become top leaders earlier research among the @entity81 tribe in @entity82 , a very patriarchal group , found the men were most competitive whereas women wear the trousers in the matriarchal @entity88 people of @entity89			1
they were even slightly more competitive than the @entity81 men			0
prof @entity24 said : ' based on these finds it has been argued competitiveness is culturally determined			0
' while it is one thing to look at cultures which are extreme in terms of gender differences , what may be found in the most gender equal society in the world ? ' if measures towards gender equality works in regard to competitiveness the gender differences ought to be smaller in countries such as @entity14			1
' but that is not the case			0
according to @entity111 there are dramatic gender differences among the top executives in @entity14 , with just ten to fifteen per cent women			2
he said : ' the studies indicate a lack of competitiveness may be a reason why women do not become top leaders			1
' this does not necessarily mean they ought to compete more			0
perhaps we need to think differently about the way we recruit top leaders			0
the most competitive candidate is not necessarily the best leader			0

boys from poorer families on the same level as girls from similar background
among the more well - off participants , boys were much more competitive
both biology and culture affect competitiveness , claims @entity14 study
suggests that it may be the reason there are not more women leaders
