what 's for dinner ? how about leftover cartilage of skate with herring - head tartar sauce , cured tuna blood line aioli or a meat loaf of offal and slightly past - its - prime cow usually reserved for dogs ? those and two dozen other dishes using scraps and usually ignored bits comprise the menu at chef @entity16 's @entity15 , a pop - up project at one of his @entity20 restaurants in @entity21 intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste			1
the farm - to - table guru , a multiple @entity27 winner and author of @entity29 : field notes on the @entity31 did n't have a hard sell on his hands when he invited 20 of his heavy hitter chef friends to join him in turning out $ 15 a la carte plates made from day - old bread , bruised beets , brine from the olive bin and the peels of pineapples			1
among the chefs backing the concept are @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , with each taking it in turn to take the lead			0
grub 's up : in this thursday , march 19 , 2015 photo , a waiter serves a couple at @entity54 in @entity21 - the menu includes dishes using scraps and other ignored bits diners have n't been put off by the idea of ' dumpster dining ' and there is currently a waitlist for @entity15			1
the final sitting will take place on march 31 and there is no word if a repeat session will occur			0
even @entity16 's tabletops and cocktails tell the story			1
the restaurateur had his @entity74 tables redone with tops from agricultural byproducts and mushroom mycelium for his two - and - a - half week pop - up			1
his boilermaker libation included flat beer syrup and spent coffee grounds with the bourbon			0
using such waste , of course , has been part of rustic cuisines around the world for centuries			2
and chefs like @entity16 , who has a second restaurant on a farm north of the city , are far more efficient than they 're given credit for			1
but in the @entity102 , the land of abundant fast food , grocery aisles piled with perfect produce and home refrigerators stuffed with food never eaten , the distribution system has been deemed broken by activists in a waste movement more firmly taking root			2
' really , the larger issue is how do we create a culture of eating that utilizes the entirety of the food system			2
' to do that we need chefs and restaurants to start the conversation , ' @entity16 said during a recent busy night of service at @entity15 , capitalized to emphasis his hope of educating the unenlightened			1
fine - dining restaurants are just a fraction in the food waste equation , however			1
about 40per cent of food grown for human consumption in the @entity102 is tossed , cramming landfills , and about a third of such food globally never makes it into human mouths			2
dinner is server : fried skate wing cartilage with smoked whitefish head tartar sauce novel idea : chef ( above ) @entity16 's @entity15 , a pop - up project at one of his @entity20 restaurants in @entity21 , is intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste with nearly one billion people starving or food insecure around the world , much of the waste is generated by @entity102 households and farms themselves , said @entity145 , an activist in @entity146 , @entity147 , and author of @entity149 : how @entity150 ( and what we can do about it )			1
' it 's a system that is not serving anyone particularly well , ' @entity145 said , noting that waste is scattered throughout the distribution chain			2
' we have an obesity crisis on a global scale in addition to a hunger crisis , the scale of which we 've never seen before , and at the same time we 're overproducing , taxing our planet to an unnecessary and dangerous amount			0
' @entity16 sees his pop - up as an extension of his ' third plate ' philosophy that challenges @entity102 to radically rethink what is acceptable and unacceptable to eat while becoming better stewards of the land			1
' in @entity102 we come with this blessed landscape , this @entity172 ... with incredible soils , temperate climate , predictable rainfall , and we produce a ton of food			0
' and because of that we were never forced into the kind of negotiations that suck up waste , ' he said			0
that goes a long way in explaining the ' wasted special ' served up by one of @entity16 's guest chefs , @entity183 of the @entity187 restaurant @entity185			1
he fashioned his plate of tuna on a bed of salvaged radish greens , incorporating them into a pesto , slicing the radish into the dish and using the usually tossed blood line of the fish in an aioli			0
chefs are trained to carve out the blood line and tuna overall is a good example of customer preference driving waste , he said			0
' people look for that certain ruby red part of the tuna			0
they 're not interested in paying top dollar for a piece on the side that may not look as beautiful but still is just as tasty , ' said @entity185 , hoping to sneak his @entity54 dish onto the menu of his own restaurant			0
' i just wo n't call it blood line			0
' a rainbow of color : ingredients used in the dishes at @entity54 are laid out in the kitchen team work : @entity16 , center and @entity183 prepare one of the dishes served at @entity54 @entity226 would n't mind			2
he and his wife live in @entity228 , @entity229 , and filmed themselves living on discarded and culled food for six months for their documentary just eat it			0
they did their share of dumpster diving - heading to unlocked bins of wholesalers for the best finds - and they came up with some treasures : cartons of eggs with plenty of time left on expiration , boxes of pricey chocolate bars tossed because they did not have the requisite @entity249 - @entity248 labeling required in @entity250 , and a mountain of packaged hummus still in containers but perfectly edible			0
' the whole reason that we did the project was to prove the food was good , ' @entity226 said			2
' everybody talks about how 40per cent of food is wasted , but to see it in the bins is another thing			0
' eating from dumpsters is not a good lifestyle for anyone			0
it 's a terrible lifestyle			0
the point is the food should n't be in the bins to begin with			0
' advocates like @entity226 , @entity16 and @entity145 applaud the higher visibility in recent years of sustainable farming techniques , as well as locavores who prefer eating food grown close to home			1
enough for all : chef @entity183 serves a taste of cured tuna blood line aioli to the waitstaff but @entity226 thinks rigid standards for date labels on packaged foods serve to muddle the edibility issue , wrongly convincing people that perfectly good food is no longer safe to eat			2
and appearance remains a huge stumbling block in the processing and packaging of food , with retailers demanding exacting uniform standards that have growers and middlemen tossing 20 to 70per cent of shipments in some cases			2
@entity298 knows that first - hand			0
he 's the president of @entity300 , a distributor and processor of produce in the @entity303 serving high - end hotels and restaurants like those of @entity16 and @entity185			1
he signed on to supply @entity15 , providing the peels of pineapples , for instance , for a dessert served with candied mango skin and an ice cream flavored with lime leaves			1
@entity315 - as a middleman - has made strides in re-purposing his own food waste , using natural enzymes to dehydrate byproduct before it hits landfills			1
the company is also a major contributor to @entity323 , which feeds the hungry in @entity21 using rescued food			1
' will there be 100 chefs tomorrow saying i want to follow @entity16 's lead ? i hope so , ' he said			1
