a father who allegedly threw his five - year - old daughter to her death off a 60ft - high @entity4 bridge is mentally incompetent , according to two doctor evaluations			1
@entity6 is accused of throwing his daughter @entity7 off the @entity8 in @entity9 last month			1
after the doctors ' statements were released this morning , court officials have said the competency hearing for @entity6 will take place on february 17			1
twelve hours before her death , a child welfare operator failed to pass along a message from @entity6 's lawyer about his mental state because she did n't think the child was in danger during the official hearing , attorneys can debate the meaning of the evaluations given thus far , which have not been made public , according to the @entity35			1
before the case proceeds , the judge needs to decide whether @entity6 understands the case against him			0
if he is ruled incompetent , he will be put into treatment and re-evaluated at a later date in hopes that treatment would make him mentally capable to stand trial			0
@entity6 ’s history of mental - health issues has been raised as one of several warning signs outlined in a @entity48 ( @entity48 ) report , according to @entity50 @entity35			2
the department revealed that it had received several calls from @entity6 ’s divorce lawyer regarding his mental state			1
just 12 hours before he allegedly threw his daughter to her death , his own lawyer called a state child abuse hotline warning that his client was suffering from mental delusions			1
but according to documents released by child welfare officials on monday , the hotline operator failed to pass on the call to investigators because she did n't think the child was in danger			1
one week prior to the lawyer 's call , another worried caller told the @entity70 that @entity6 's daughter @entity7 had been physically abused in the past the casket of @entity73 is carried out after memorial services at @entity75 in @entity76 last month one week earlier , another worried caller told the @entity70 that @entity6 's daughter @entity7 had been physically abused in the past			1
that call , however , also failed to get to @entity48 investigators because the operator hung up before she got @entity6 's address			1
instead of calling back , she simply closed the case , according to the state 's investigation			0
the lapses have cast the already troubled @entity48 in a harsh spotlight , prompting new secretary @entity90 to change hotline protocol			0
going forward , if a caregiver seems to be experiencing a psychotic episode , a child protective investigator will be required to visit within four hours			0
police say @entity73 was likely alive when her father sped past a police officer january 8 , stopped on the @entity8 in @entity9 , pulled the girl from the back seat and dropped her to her death			0
he was arrested and accused of first - degree murder , but has n't formally been charged as he is undergoing mental health evaluations			1
@entity6 's own divorce lawyer had warned authorities of his mental state january 7 , telling the hotline operator that @entity6 had driven to three different churches in his pajamas with @entity7 in tow and asked his attorney to translate a @entity112 @entity111 into @entity113			1
another worried caller told the @entity48 and families a week before the bridge drama that @entity6 's daughter @entity7 had been physically abused in the past @entity6 was also expressing paranoid fears that @entity7 was not his biological daughter , his lawyer said			1
' he 's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his , it just really concerns me , ' the unidentified attorney told an operator , later adding , ' it 's all craziness and it does n't make any sense and he 's out of his mind			0
' but the report noted the relatively inexperienced operator said the caller seemed more worried about @entity6 's mental state , not the child 's safety and labeled the call as ' inadequate supervision ' and did not turn it over to investigators			1
the attorney even noted that @entity48 had an open investigation on the family , but the operator said she could n't find the report and did not ask a supervisor , according to the state 's investigation			2
the missing report came from a caller who alleged family violence , inadequate supervision and substance misuse at the @entity6 home			0
' we are reminded yet again that every process within our system should be critically examined at every opportunity to ensure that the role it plays is carried out effectively , ' @entity90 said in the report			0
@entity7 's mother @entity158 is helped away from her daughter 's funeral last month			0
@entity73 was in the custody of her father when he threw his child to her death ignoring calls has been a problem in the past and the hotline has undergone a multi-million dollar overhaul			0
among the other problems uncovered in the investigation of @entity7 's death , @entity171 's child protective investigators had 25 vacancies and were overwhelmed by the high number of new cases			0
although the area has a network of nearby mental health , substance abuse and domestic violence resources , investigators do n't routinely seek expert advice before closing cases , using the organizations only for referrals			2
investigators also seemed more focused on whether @entity7 and her siblings ' basic needs were being met , instead of addressing the histories of domestic violence , mental health , and substance abuse issues in the home , according to the report			2
@entity48 investigators have struggled over the years to look at the big picture in several other high - profile child abuse deaths			0
a call in june of 2013 first brought child investigators to the @entity6 home where they closed the case , agreeing that family violence threatened @entity7			2
@entity6 was arrested as a result of the call after an altercation with @entity7 's mother			2
he and @entity7 later moved out of the home , but monday 's report noted that no services or interventions were put in place .			0
