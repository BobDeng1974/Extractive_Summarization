yesterday 's raid bore all the hallmarks of having been carried out by the @entity4 , a gang responsible for audacious heists across @entity53 and beyond over the past two decades			0
they always wear balaclavas or face masks and use @entity57 and high - powered stolen cars to carry out their spectacular crimes			2
the @entity4 are said to speak several languages and travel on genuine passports issued to other people , but with the photos changed			0
many are former soldiers from @entity53			0
@entity65 is their favoured operating ground but they have carried out more than 100 heists across the globe , netting £ 300million			0
cities where they have struck include @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0

the @entity17 , known as the ‘ @entity118 ’ is hugely popular with holidaymakers , and is used by hundreds of thousands of @entity121 drivers every year			1
the methods used in the robbery immediately led to speculation that the @entity4 – a notorious gang of criminals from @entity53 – had struck again			2
the gang earned their name in 1993 after stealing a £ 500,000 diamond from a jewellers in @entity130 , @entity71 , and hiding it in a jar of face cream – a tactic copied from the 1963 film @entity135 , starring @entity136 as the bungling inspector clouseau			0
