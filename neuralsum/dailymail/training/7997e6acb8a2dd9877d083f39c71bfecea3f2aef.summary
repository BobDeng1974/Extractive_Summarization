these adorable pictures show two kittens being nursed back to health with the help of babies ' socks after being found minutes from death			1
the kittens , @entity8 and @entity9 , were found abandoned in a shed in @entity10 , west @entity11 two weeks ago , severely malnourished and only a couple of weeks old			1
thankfully they are now on the road to recovery - partly thanks to a pair of babies ' socks and some clever thinking			2
ms @entity31 , based at the @entity30 's animal hospital in @entity38 , south - west @entity11 , has to hand - feed them every two hours , and give them lots of love and attention			1
centre manager @entity43 said : ' you may wonder about the outfits			0
' unfortunately these two naughty boys have a habit of suckling each other in their sleep and making themselves sore			0
' our nurse came up with these fabulous outfits to help stop the habit			0
' they are made from baby socks as they really are that small			0
as you can see they are very happy and not affected by them			0
' the kittens will be re-homed in a month , but vets will make sure the inseparable pair go to the same owner one of the kittens has befriended a dog at @entity67 's animal hospital , where they are recovering despite the vets ' best efforts to stop the kittens from playing with each other , @entity8 and @entity9 are almost inseparable			1
@entity8 and @entity9 will be available for re-homing in around a month once they are fully weaned , but will have to be kept together because they are so close			1
ms @entity43 said : ' we are seeing such a high number of kittens coming into our care , and we would like to urge people to remember to get their cats neutered to try and avoid unwanted litters of kittens			2
' hand - rearing is so time intensive and our staff are overwhelmed by the sheer number of cats and kittens that need our help			1
' the @entity30 is urging people to adopt a kitten rather than buy one because of a surge in abandoned and neglected cats so far this year			2
the charity has taken 14 per cent more poorly cared for cats this year than last , and has rescued 3,306 abandoned cats so far in 2014			0
