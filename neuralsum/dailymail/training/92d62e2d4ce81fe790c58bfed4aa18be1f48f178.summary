the @entity20 seen against the backdrop of the @entity22 , one of @entity4 's most famous landmarks cabins are tested high above the @entity26 arenas , formerly the @entity27 , and the @entity7 in @entity4 during the test drives the gondolas were filled with workers to see how the system would cope with passengers the month - long period before the @entity6 will see transport bosses recoup as much as possible of the rumoured £ 50m cost of the @entity11			1

@entity2 say passengers with a travelcard or other @entity40 ( including @entity84 ) will be able to fly for the same fare but will need to buy a boarding pass from ticket offices or vending machines at either end of the route			2
it was feared that the network would be not be finished in time for the start of the @entity94 on july 27 but an application for final approval has been received by transport secretary @entity97			0
it means that spectators will be able to use the cable cars to travel between two of the @entity94 venues - the @entity51 on the south bank of the @entity7 and the @entity52 in east @entity4			0
the @entity20 - sponsored transport will be the first urban cable car system of its kind in the @entity107			0

' this innovative airborne travel link will be a vital component in the ongoing renaissance of a vibrant easterly quarter of the capital , providing a much - needed river crossing			0
' the consortium to build and operate the cable car was led by @entity138 , whose past projects include the @entity140 and the @entity141 in @entity4			0
the cost of the cable car was originally estimated at around £ 25m and it was intended to be funded entirely by private investors			2
but , despite a 10 - year sponsorship deal with the @entity147 - based airline @entity20 worth £ 36m , public money was needed to make up the shortfall			0
@entity4 now joins cities including @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 which all operate cable car systems .			0
