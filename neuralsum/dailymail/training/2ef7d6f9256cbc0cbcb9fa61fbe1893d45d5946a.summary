@entity0 is walking away from @entity2 football having never lifted the greatest domestic trophy – the @entity4 – but he is not alone			1
there are a whole host of other great players who have graced the game in this country but never got their hands on the holy grail			0
@entity12 has compiled an xi of the greatest players to have played in this country but not won the title since the @entity4 's inception in 1992			1
@entity18 @entity4 clubs : @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 set the record for most consecutive appearances in the @entity4 at 310 between august 2004 and october 2012			1
consistently been one of the league 's top stoppers , but spells at @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , in 17 years in the top flight – and still going at 43 – did not lead to the league title			1
@entity23 goalkeeper @entity18 smiles during a match against @entity32 in 2012 @entity33 club : @entity20 the defender shared @entity0 's pain , winning countless trophies together – including the @entity38 , the @entity39 , the @entity40 , two @entity41 , three @entity42 , and the @entity43 – but never the league title			1
during his 17 years at @entity20 , @entity33 was one of the most consistently high performing defenders in the top flight			2
@entity20 defender @entity33 gestures during the @entity48 derby at @entity49 in may 2013 @entity50 @entity4 club : @entity52 one of the best centre backs in the world during his six years at @entity52 , but though he won the @entity58 and @entity38 with @entity59 during that time it did not work out as well in west @entity60			1
lifted the @entity61 , @entity40 and @entity43 while at @entity62 and countless other titles across @entity64 – including twice the @entity38			0
@entity52 's @entity50 ( right ) puts in a challenge on @entity66 during a match at @entity49 in 1999 @entity68 club : @entity23 on raw ability @entity68 is up there with the best of them , but chronic knee problems held him back			2
once described as a ' freak ' by @entity76 because he could not kick a ball in training and only play one game a week but still be the best player on the pitch at the heart of defence			0
won the @entity84 in 13 years at @entity23 , but nothing else			0
@entity68 ( left ) has his eye on the ball during @entity23 ' match against @entity89 at @entity90 in 2010 @entity0 club : @entity20 he is perhaps the greatest player not to have won the @entity4 , given that he has been at a club who have had the squad to win it for countless seasons he has been there but never quite made it			1
last season was the closest he came , slipping up at the death – literally , against @entity52 – to allow @entity32 to pip them to it by two points			0
@entity0 celebrates his goal for @entity20 against @entity102 in the @entity4 last month @entity103 @entity4 clubs : @entity105 , @entity23 , @entity22 , @entity106 the mercurial @entity107 was an integral part of the @entity105 side who , in the 1995 - 96 season , agonisingly threw away a 10 - point lead in january to finish four points behind @entity114			1
that was as close as he got , despite seven years in @entity2 football			0
@entity107 @entity103 ( right ) controls the ball during a match between @entity52 and @entity105 @entity119 club : @entity121 @entity119 did not win a single trophy despite 16 years dazzling @entity2 football with his skills and goals at @entity121			0
perhaps his devotion to the south coast club cost him a chance at winning cups , but it did not stop him being regarded as one of the country 's great midfielders			0
@entity119 celebrates a goal for @entity121 in a @entity4 match against @entity22 @entity135 @entity4 club : @entity137 , @entity52 @entity138 never won the @entity4 with @entity137			1
he played @entity84 matches for the club during the 2003 - 04 season when they won the title , but did not break into the first team in the league until the following campaign , and they have not won it since			2
this could be his year , at rivals @entity52			0
@entity135 celebrates after scoring from the penalty sport for @entity137 against @entity149 in 2010 @entity150 @entity4 club : @entity23 you would not bet against the @entity154 winger winning the @entity4 one day , but he has n't yet			2
when he left @entity23 in that world record £ 86million deal he was without a trophy but he has since gone on to win four in his first 18 months in @entity158			0
@entity150 celebrates a goal for @entity23 against @entity160 at @entity90 in may 2013 @entity161 @entity4 club : @entity52 won the @entity163 title alongside @entity164 at @entity165 and lit up the @entity4 when he moved to @entity2 in 1996			1
seven years at @entity52 produced some sparkling football and moments of magic from the mercurial @entity169 and six other trophies – but not the @entity4			0
@entity52 's @entity161 celebrates with the fans after scoring against @entity172 at @entity62 in 2000 @entity173 @entity4 clubs : @entity20 , @entity175 , @entity32 the player to hit the most goals in the @entity4 without winning the title , sixth on the all - time list with 162			1
he was known for his instinctive finishing , but though it brought him many trophies at @entity20 , the league was not one of them			0
@entity20 's @entity173 celebrates after scoring against @entity186 at @entity187 in 1999			2
