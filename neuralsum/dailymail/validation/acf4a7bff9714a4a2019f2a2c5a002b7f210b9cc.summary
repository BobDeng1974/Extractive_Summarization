while most parents choose to enrol their children in cricket or tennis , a rising number have embraced the taboo of pole dancing as an after - school activity through a new brand of all - ages ' pole fitness ' classes			1
the growing number of dance studios around @entity14 offering classes to children as young as four has sparked criticism from advocates against the sexualisation of young girls as well as the @entity21 , but many in the industry claim pole fitness is purely about exercise			1
' unfortunately in @entity14 pole is still associated for the majority as something that takes place in a strip club , [ but that ] is an adult stereotype that is placed on a perfectly legitimate workout , ' @entity25 , who runs classes for children from her studio in @entity30 's east , told @entity38			1
while the studio also offers classes for adults , she maintains that none of the moves that the juniors are taught could be considered sexual and that the activity is a fantastic activity for children and teenagers			1
' for a lot of parents it can be difficult to motivate teenagers to exercise and get involved in sports , pole is just another avenue that can be utilised to help build strength , stay healthy , active and build confidence , ' she said			1
the classes , which require parental consent , usually involve a warm up , basic gymnastic routines , spins on the pole , and pole routines , depending on age and skills level			2
@entity25 ( left ) , who owns @entity45 in @entity30 , is pictured with her daughter , justice ( centre ) , and partner @entity75 justice 's mother is a former showgirl in the exotic industry and said pole fitness was a sport @entity25 said there was a distinction to be drawn between pole dancing and pole fitness or ' sport ' , which focuses on the athletic benefits of the activity rather than performers who ' adapt a more exotic dance style choreography into their classes '			1
but @entity92 , spokesperson for @entity93 , a grassroots movement against the sexualisation of girls , said the sport was still connected to its strip - club association , which could place children in a vulnerable position			2
' if this is purely about fitness , then why would n't you choose gymnastics instead of placing them in a context which they do n't have enough knowledge about to consent to ? ' ms @entity92 said			0
' let them be kids , instead of participating in an adultified form of gymnastics			0
i would question why parents would choose to put their children in such a scenario if pole dancing was purely for fitness			2
' but @entity92 , spokesperson for @entity93 , a grassroots movement against the sexualisation of girls , said the sport was still connected to its strip - club association @entity121 , spokesperson for the @entity21 , said the argument that pole fitness was purely an exercise based activity was not a new one ' teenagers can now enrol in burlesque and lap dancing classes			1
in the current context the uniform of pole dancing is high heels , feather boas , and spread legs , ' she said			0
@entity121 , spokesperson for the @entity21 , said the argument that pole fitness was purely an exercise based activity was not a new one			1
' it is wonderful for children to exercise and get fit , and it 's been argued that it increases body strength for at least four years now , but there are other , less sexualised , ways to get fit , ' ms @entity121 said			1
' i do think it sexualised and if you have children competing publicly those moves are on display			2
' as well as running @entity45 , @entity25 also heads up the @entity156 in @entity14 , which introduced a junior category for the first time this year , in response to what she claims a growing acceptance of pole dancing in the mainstream			1
pole dancing has seemingly exploded in @entity14 over the past decade , with many women - and men - embracing the activity for recreation , fitness , and almost everything in between			2
@entity25 ( left ) also heads up the @entity156 in @entity14 the national championships have introduced a junior category for the first time this year , in response to what she claims a growing acceptance of pole dancing in the mainstream justice @entity43 attends her mother 's pole fitness classes and can contort herself into many different position on the pole from hens nights and 21st birthdays , to circus performers and festival attractions , pole dancing has enjoyed a good run - indigenous dancer @entity186 auditioned for @entity14 's @entity187 in 2011 with his pole dancing routine			1
however ms @entity121 said that while adults have the ability to make an informed decision about whether to engage in pole dancing , children are not in a position to do the same			2
' it ’s really up to the parent to decide if they want to enrol their children , but they need to be fully informed and empowered to make decisions for children when they ’re too young , ' she said			2
@entity25 said that children were unaware of the sexualisation of pole and were more likely to be monkey - like in their movements , rather than imitate any racy dance moves they might see			1
' kids are not aware of the stereotypes some surround pole with and innocently participate in an activity which is fun , challenging and rewarding , it is the negative attitudes of adults who create the stereotypes stigma of kids doing pole , ' she said			0
' any pole trick that is performed usually has its counterpart or similar in gymnastics or ballet			0
@entity220 originally has been performed in @entity221 and @entity222 for 100 ’s of years by predominantly men in circus and as a sport			0
' @entity227 ( above ) began pole dancing when she was 15 years of age @entity230 runs @entity231 in @entity233 's @entity232 , which also offers teen pole dancing lessons and said that every studio she has been to has offered classes to children 12 years and over			1
' i signed up at 17 years of age , so it ’s not something i really think about			0
as long as we have a parent ’s permission , with written consent , i do not think there is anything wrong with children or teenagers attending classes , ' @entity230 said			2
' pole dancing is a sport which requires athleticism , tremendous strength and skill			2
it is another art form of dance and expression , using a vertical pole as the apparatus , ' she said			0
' ultimately , i would like to see stereotypical and preconceived ideas regarding pole dancing continue to be challenged , so pole dancing and the people who choose to do it , are respected for their talent , skills and the strength they have achieved			0
' @entity227 said she was drawn to pole dancing after seeing a video and signed up immedidately ' pole fitness is n’t about being sexy and stripping , it ’s about setting a goal and achieving it , ' @entity227 said @entity227 , now 18 , began pole dancing lessons at @entity274 at the age of 15 , and said that when she tells people she does pole dancing they will often ask if it involves stripping , but that she does n't see the sport as sexual			1
' pole fitness is n’t about being sexy and stripping , it ’s about setting a goal and achieving it			1
in my opinion , pole sports does not sexualise young girls , we ’re not promoting pole to be sexual we ’re promoting it to be a fitness , ' @entity227 said			1
' personally , i think young girls should be allowed to do this sport , it is an amazing way to get fit			0
i think children and teens should have all rights to start at any age , there is no age limit to being fit			0
' ' personally , i think young girls should be allowed to do this sport , it is an amazing way to get fit , ' said @entity227 @entity231 in @entity233 's @entity232 offers classes for teenagers ( 2015 graduation concert above ) ms @entity304 said that she believed studios were taking pole dancing and ' white washing ' it of all connections to the sex industry and 're - branding as fitness '			1
' pole dancing still refuses to distance itself from the sex industry			0
there is a definite crossover , pole dancing is still featured at @entity319 , and i think it 's really sinister to enrol kids in pole dancing classes because they have no idea of the context of it , ' she said			0
' if they are performing routines that are used by adults in connection to the sex industry that is a real burden on a child			0
' ms @entity121 said that she was concerned that children engaging in pole fitness would not realise the impact of their movements , and that as they got older if the activity had been presented as a legitimate sport it could cause issues			1
' i think there needs to be some caution exercised , because we ca n't control people 's perceptions			0
i do n't know how controlled the competitions are and if i had a daughter i 'd be very concerned , ' she said			0
' it reminds me of beauty pageants , little girls all done up and makes me feel very uneasy			0
they gorgeous and completely innocent and unware of the message they are sending out into the ether			0
