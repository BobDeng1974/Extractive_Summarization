@entity0 has cited the ' offside law ' that led to @entity3 's exit as the only thing that he would change about his side 's @entity7 campaign			1
@entity3 arrived home from @entity10 on wednesday after an extremely disappointing tournament that saw them exit at the group stage of a @entity7 for the first time since 1958 - taking just a single point in the process			2
and upon being asked about any regrets he may be bringing back from @entity10 , @entity0 referred @entity18 's inadvertent assist in the build - up to @entity21 's winner for @entity22 as his biggest frustration of all			1
' but i wo n't be changing any laws of the game			0
' that is how small the margins are			0
' @entity0 also rounded on the critics who say he should be sacked by highlighting @entity3 's attacking performance against @entity54			1
' if you take your mind back after the first game , i seem to remember the general consensus and opinion was that the team had done very well and that things were looking very bright			0
' so then we lose 2 - 1 to @entity22 to a freak goal after a period of domination and all of a sudden everything we have done as a team and a group in terms of preparation is wrong			0
' disappointing : @entity0 lead @entity3 to their worst ever @entity7 finals performance dejection : @entity0 and his players saluting the fans following their draw with @entity78 ' we accept we have failed and we will do our best to put it right before 2016			1
' ' the @entity81 made it very clear after the second game that they wanted me to stay on and lead the team for the next two years			0
' ' the players and the staff want me to continue and i am very happy to continue			2
' ' we have seen a lot of good players coming through , the evolution has been very good so we think that the future is actually looking much brighter now than it was some months ago even and we have to hope and rely on the players to take us there			2
