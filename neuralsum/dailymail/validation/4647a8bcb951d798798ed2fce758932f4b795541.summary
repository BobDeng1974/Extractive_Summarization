@entity0 has warned @entity2 team - mate @entity1 that he will have to wait patiently for a place in @entity5 ’s midfield			1
@entity1 was still only 19 years old when he made his @entity5 debut in september 2013 and set pulses racing with some of his performances for @entity2 last season which earned him a place at last summer ’s @entity11 in @entity12			1
but this campaign the 21 - year - old has struggled for the same kind of form and , despite winning 10 @entity5 caps already , does not currently appear to be in @entity19 ’s first - team plans			2
@entity1 has been played in multiple positions for club and country and @entity2 manager @entity23 has experimented the most with him out on the wing , as an attacking central midfielder or further back in the middle			2
@entity1 may have to wait for his chance to impress with @entity5 , according to team - mate @entity0 @entity0 spoke on wednesday about his club team - mate 's progress in what has been a difficult season the @entity2 skipper said he believed @entity1 would have to bide his time and wait for an opportunity ‘ i think @entity1 will have to bide his time , ’ @entity0 , who is his club captain , said			1
‘ and when he does get the opportunities for @entity5 , keep playing the way he has , keep playing well , keep being positive and hopefully when he gets that chance to play in two or three games on the spin , that is his chance keep the shirt and make it much harder for someone to take it off him			0
‘ it is difficult with the position he would try to get in the team in			0
we have got a fantastic amount of midfielders that come away with @entity5 and quite a lot who want to play in a similar position			0
’ one player almost certain of a starting place in the crunch games is goalkeeper @entity59			2
after being dropped by @entity60 earlier in the season , he has worked his way back into guaranteed first pick			0
@entity1 has had a difficult season with @entity2 after a brilliant breakthrough campaign last year that season resulted in a @entity11 call - up , and @entity1 looked a bright spark against @entity69 earlier in @entity5 's group , @entity1 congratulates @entity71 after coming on against @entity72 that culminated in his stand - out performance against @entity75 , in which @entity76 described him as ‘ phenomenal ’ even though he could not prevent @entity60 going out of the @entity77			1
@entity0 , @entity1 and the rest of their @entity2 team - mates watched the match in @entity81 ahead of their @entity83 tie			1
‘ we were pretty much laughing at the performance from @entity59 , ’ @entity0 revealed			2
‘ it was just one of those nights			0
’ it is sometimes difficult to get the accolades when you 're at a big team			0
it is normally the people scoring the goals and things like that , but when @entity59 is needed he normally comes up trumps with some fantastic saves or some fantastic decisions in games			0
' @entity0 said he was ' laughing ' at @entity59 's performance against @entity75 in the @entity77 @entity59 was in brilliant form to repeatedly deny @entity76 and co at the @entity105 in last week 's second leg			1

@entity1 was part of the @entity5 squad for last summer 's @entity11
but this season he has struggled for form with his club @entity2
@entity0 says his team - mate may have to wait for his @entity5 chance
