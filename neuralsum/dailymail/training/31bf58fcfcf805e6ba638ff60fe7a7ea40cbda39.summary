when cola the cat was born , @entity0 was running the country , @entity3 was topping the box office and rapper @entity5 was a newborn baby			2
now , after 28 years , the feline is set to celebrate a milestone birthday - turning 140 in cat years and being crowned @entity8 's oldest moggy			1
until now a cat called @entity11 , from ravensden , @entity12 , was thought to hold the crown of @entity8 's oldest living feline - after celebrating his 27th birthday this year			1
born in the eighties : @entity18 will turn 28 this year and is believed to be @entity8 's oldest cat but @entity18 , who was born in in november 1985 , trumps him by several months			1
the cat , whose favourite foods are cream , custard and salmon , has only been to the vet once - to get spayed			1
@entity28 , 66 , has lived with her pet at her home in @entity31 , south - east @entity32 , since @entity18 was a kitten			1
she put her cat ’s extraordinary long life down to lots of treats and regular walks with her pet dog , and said : ' i do n’t throw big birthday parties for her , because every day she is around is a celebration			1
' we have had children who have grown up to have their own families and @entity18 has lived through all that and is still around			0
it ’s quite a milestone			0
the years have absolutely flown by			2
curiosity has n't killed this cat : @entity8 's oldest feline cola with her owner @entity28 ' the secret to her long life is love and spoiling			1
she loves her luxuries like cream , custard and salmon			1
she always has a good nibble from my plate as well as her own cat food			2
' i ’ve got children , grandchildren and great grandchildren who come over to play with her and keep her busy			0
' apart from a touch of arthritis in her old age , @entity18 has always been as fit as a fiddle			2
mrs @entity28 , who has four grandchildren and two great grandchildren , said : ' she has been lucky and not really had many close shaves or problems			1
' the nearest she came to getting unstuck was on one of our trips out			0
' she used to go on walks with me and our pet @entity84 dog to the park , she would sit in the tree while me and the dog played and then follow us home			0
' but once a @entity89 dog spotted her and chased @entity90			0
that was a nerve - racking experience for her , but luckily she out ran him			0
' she was quite a sprightly cat in her day , she loved chasing birds and would catch mice and sometimes bring them into the house			2
' she is still reasonably fit for her age and can still jump onto a chair - but she does n’t have quite the same spring in her step			2
' the retired school cleaner said a healthy dose of treats has kept her moggy in top shape			2
she said : ' she is quite a hardy cat			0
i have pampered her a bit with her treats - probably most vets would say she should n’t have this or that , but she is still going strong			0
' still not lost her fizz : @entity18 has reached the grand old age of 140 in cat years born at the bottom of a wardrobe at mrs @entity28 ’s mother - in - law ’s home in @entity119 , @entity18 has gone on to have three litters of kittens and was a ' fantastic mum '			1
@entity18 will be @entity8 's oldest cat when she turns 28 in november mrs @entity28 ’s husband @entity124 , 72 , a retired driver , said : ' she has always been very friendly and is a real favourite with our grandchildren - they have kept her fit by playing with her			1
' we have always had lots of animals - cats , dogs , hamsters , rabbits , chinchillas - and @entity18 has got on with them all			0
' she has lived to such a grand age			0
perhaps she really does have nine lives ? she is a lucky black cat , that ’s for sure			1
' hopefully she still has a few years left in her , although she is n’t as sprightly as she one was she still has some go in her			0
' the @entity140 are desperate to discover if their beloved moggy is the oldest in the world - and said they would be ' overjoyed ' if she claimed the title			0
mrs @entity28 said : ' i ’ve never heard of another cat reach her age , so i wondered if she was the oldest in the country			1
' i would really love to know if she is			0
i would be over the moon if she was crowned the world ’s oldest cat			0
' according to @entity153 , the oldest living cat is 23 - year - old @entity154 , born on october 31 , 1989 from @entity155 , @entity156 however , there were reports in june of a 31 - year - old cat called @entity160 living in @entity161			1
