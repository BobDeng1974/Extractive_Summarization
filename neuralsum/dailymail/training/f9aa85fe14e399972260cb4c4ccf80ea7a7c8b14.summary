from holodecks and virtual surgeons to 3d printed smart clothes and virtual sex , it seems the future is about to get a lot more hi - tech. researchers were asked to imagine the technology they believe will be around in 2025 , when ultra high speed ' gigabit ' internet connections are commonplace			1
the agree that virtual reality will be key , and say the age of the @entity13 ' holodeck ' could finally arrive			1
the age of gigabit connectivity is dawning and will advance in coming years			2
a gigabit connection can deliver 1,000 megabits of information per second ( @entity24 )			0
globally , cloud service provider @entity25 reports that the average global connection speed in quarter one of 2014 was 3.9 mbps , with @entity28 reporting the highest average connection speed , 23.6 mbps and the @entity30 at 10.5 mbps			1
the new report from the @entity32 and @entity33 called @entity34 in the @entity35 , asked 1,464 experts what the advent of gigabit - speed internet connections will mean			1
they all agree that virtual environments were likely to become key			1
' there will be full , always - on , 360 - degree environmental awareness , a semantic overlay on the real world , and full - presence massive open online courses			1
' @entity48 wo n't break up nearly as much , ' said @entity49 , @entity50			0
however , they believe that pornography will be among the prime uses of the technology as holodecks appear at home			0
' on the entertainment front , something like the @entity59 concept first shown in the old @entity13 series is actually within our grasp by 2025 , ' said @entity64 , an analyst with @entity65			2
' games , films , shopping for cars and vacations , and ( of course ) porn will all become immersive 3d experiences			0
' however , rather than the current vitual worlds , experts say that holograms could finally become a reality			1
' no doubt the killer app will be real - life holograms operating in real time : for instance , as doctors , as surgeons , as coworkers , ' @entity78 said			1
he believes it could mean the end of having to go to the office			0
' sensors everywhere — on property , on our clothes , on ( and perhaps in ) our bodies , all of it feeding digital information to be processed on servers or filtered and passed to the cloud			0
' by 2025 small devices might be powered by harvested energy , in which case the possibilities expand dramatically			2
' on the receiving end of this massive information flow will be large displays at work and in many homes through which vast quantities of information can be rapidly visualized			0
' we have lagged in exploiting this because it is more difficult to model or demo than a simple application , but it will come			0
' @entity116 , @entity117 ' it will change the workplace			0
not only will it diminish the need for business travel , it will also increase competition in the labor market immensely			0
' whereas before you had to compete with fellow humans in the same physical area , immigrants for example , in the future you have to compete with ' cloud immigrants ' — coworkers appearing in their work as a hologram			0
' @entity135 being filmed to be made into a hologram : researchers believe that by 2025 , holograms will be commonplace , and allow us to work and even recieve healthcare at home			1
schoolchildren are also likely to spend far less time in the classroom , it was predicted			0
' the school day will disaggregate into a number of learning sessions , some at home , some in the neighborhood , some in pairs , some in larger groups , with different kinds of facilitators			2
' @entity159 of @entity160 said			0
he also believes that advances in technology will lead to a massive change in how we shop - with a new outfit being printed every day , and recycled once it has been worn			1
' wearing clothes that are tailor - made for you every day , 3d - printed at home , will also become normal , with the previous day 's clothes recycled efficiently ' said @entity159 ' entertainment appliances , environmental control systems , and security alarm systems will all benefit from third - party service providers managing these systems on our behalf			1
' smart cities will amass substantial information in real time to deal with traffic , power generation , and distribution			0
' high - speed connectivity means streaming will be replaced by download / playback except for real - time events			1
group interaction and perhaps 3d video will become a reality			2
' already we see a lot of the former in @entity195 ’s hangouts			0
' 3d printing will lead to completely new supply chains including for raw materials			0
' designs will be transferred on the @entity200 and devices created at the end points with @entity196 and manual or automatic assembly			1
” @entity205 , vice president and chief internet evangelist for @entity195 the report also says that our diets will change dramatically , as will the way we monitor our health			2
' the next big food fad , after hipster locavores , will be individualized scientific diets , based on the theory that each person 's unique genetics , locations , and activities mean that she requires a specific diet , specially formulated each day			2
' @entity220 , @entity50 claimed			0
@entity221 , @entity195 's chief economist , says that our health will also improve thanks to more monitoring			2
experts all agree that virtual environments were likely to become key in the future ' the big story here is continuous health monitoring ... it will be much cheaper and more convenient to have that monitoring take place outside the hospital			1
' you will be able to purchase health - monitoring systems just like you purchase home - security systems			1
' indeed , the home - security system will include health monitoring as a matter of course			1
robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace			2

*dozens* of experts were asked to predict how high speed connections will be used in 2025
claims holograms will be commonplace
virtual reality *headset* will allow us to live ( and have sex ) in a virtual world
new outfits will be @entity196 printed every day , and recycled once worn
our health will be constantly monitored - with *holographic* surgeons able to operate remotely
