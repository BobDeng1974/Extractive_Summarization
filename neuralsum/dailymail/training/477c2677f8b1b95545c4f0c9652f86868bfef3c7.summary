' i knew that by speaking the truth we were going to make people upset , ' @entity0 told @entity135 during an interview from @entity12			1

@entity174 said @entity0 's comments were a blunder			0
' it 's no surprise that @entity0 would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people ; this is exactly what we 've come to expect from @entity0 here at home , ' said @entity188 spokeswoman @entity187			2
' @entity0 is just embarrassing himself			0
