@entity2 , 29 , could have faced life behind bars after stabbing the woman once in her side and five times in a broad daylight attack on a street in @entity6			1

@entity32 @entity31 heard that on december 14 last year @entity2 , of no fixed address , was travelling in a car in @entity6 with the female victim , @entity3 , 27 , and another man			2

but @entity2 took the knife from her and stabbed her six times , once in the side and five times in the back			1
he then ran off down an alleyway and went into hiding before he was found two days later			0

jailing @entity2 , who has previous convictions for domestic violence on different partners , for a total of four years , mr @entity66 told him he posed a high risk to all women			1
after already spending a year behind bars on remand , @entity2 could be eligible for parole within just 12 months			1
the judge said : ' originally you faced a charge of attempted murder but because vital evidence had been lost a plea to section 20 was accepted			1
' you pose a high risk of harm to the victim and to all women			0
there is clearly a significant risk to female members of the public			0
' there was an intention to commit serious harm			0
' the sentence also included a guilty plea for assaulting a man outside a flat in november last year after they got into an argument over noise			0
after falling to the floor , the victim was kicked in the head by @entity2 before he jumped with both feet onto his back			2
