@entity1 mogul @entity0 has bought a £ 25million super yacht that is so big it is almost classed as a ship			1
the 155ft - long vessel has been commissioned by the 58 - year - old and will blow his current 120ft - long boat out of the water			1
but it pales in comparison to the @entity10 , the world 's largest private yacht			1
owned by @entity16 oligarch @entity14 , that vessel is a staggering 536ft - long and cost £ 272million			1
it has two swimming pools , two helipads , a gym , hair salon , dancefloor and a 007 - style submarine			2
known only as @entity40 , it will be 590ft - long and cost £ 400million			1
still , mr @entity0 can take comfort in the fact his yacht will have four decks to house 12 close friends as well as ten crew members			2
construction recently began at @entity48 in @entity35 , @entity36 , and floor - plans have hinted at what will be contained within			1
the sky deck could boast a giant hot tub and bar and the upper deck will feature a luxurious dining area			2
an on - board nightclub will be built and , after a tiring night of partying , mr @entity0 and his guests will be able to relax in the lower deck day - room			2
there will be a ‘ beach club ’ stern and ‘ panoramic viewing platforms ’ down the side , giving guests a front row seat for the @entity62 at @entity63			0
the yacht will have an on - board garage complete with small boats and jet skis			1
it will cost approximately £ 30,000 to fill up the super yacht with fuel for her 4,500 - mile range			1
a team of workers began building the 500 - tonne vessel in april			1
construction is expected to be finished by december next year			2
it will be the largest ever built by @entity31 , a firm that has long been a favourite with @entity1 drivers including @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
@entity30 , founder of @entity31 , said : ' she will not be owned by many but those that do will be buying a craft of exceptional style , quality and innovation			0
' mr @entity0 owns a 120ft vessel named ‘ snapper ’ , which is currently moored in @entity63			0
now a commentator at the @entity98 , he is a member of the @entity99 in @entity100 and has keen interests in extreme sports outside of sailing , including skiing			0
last month , stunned photographers captured images of the @entity108 vessel as it was transported out of the 170 - metre dry dock at the yard of @entity114 shipbuilder @entity112			1
it had because too large to build inside			0
the yacht , which was minus its bow section , was quickly moved to the larger 220 - metre dock so engineers could continue with their work			1
@entity121 , from @entity122 , said : ' the photographers who took the pictures of @entity40 were overwhelmed by the size of it			0
' it is difficult to say at this stage but i think it will be a very elegant yacht and more interesting looking then @entity10			0
' there appears to be a special propulsion system which should make it one of the fastest yachts out there			0
' in terms of length , we think it will be around 180 - metres which makes it longer than some cruise ships			0
' if it has been commissioned for the @entity145 it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often			0
it is more of a question of prestige , to have the world 's largest yacht			0
' the yacht 's ' beach club ' stern			0
it will also have ' panoramic viewing platforms ' down each side side , giving guests a front row seat for the @entity62 at @entity63 yacht fans : mr @entity0 ( left ) may live a life of luxury , but his yacht is almost like a toy when compared to the private boat owned by @entity14 ( right ) huge : @entity10 , owned by @entity16 owner mr @entity14 , has two swimming pools , two helipads , a gym , hair salon , dancefloor and a 007 - style submarine official details on mega yachts , such as @entity108 and mr @entity14 's @entity10 , are notoriously sketchy due to confidentiality agreements set up between the builders and their customers			1
but they are known to have incredible security systems and it is not uncommon for them to be flanked by smaller yachts and submarines which help make up a billionaire 's flotilla			0
it is thought a yacht this size will cost its new owner around £ 400million - and that is just the initial payment with the yacht having astronomical running costs			1
the yacht 's fuel tank will be able to hold a staggering one million litres while the owner will have to pay 50 of the best staff in the world to man it 365 days of the year			0
@entity112 , which is building @entity40 , has refused to discuss the top secret yacht although rumours in the industry are that is being build for @entity39 billionaire @entity204			0
@entity204 , 57 , is worth around £ 10billion and a member of the @entity39 royal family			0
if he is the owner , he is thought to have ordered the new toy as a replacement for his @entity210 yacht , which he has enjoyed for the past 20 - years			2
when the yacht is completed next year it is most likely to be moored on the @entity214 but there will be just two locations which can accommodate a boat of such size - @entity63 and @entity219			2
ousted : but mr @entity14 is about to lose his title as the owner of the world 's largest private yacht - after this incredible vessel was spotted in @entity114 last month on the move : the yacht , which was minus its bow section , was quickly taken to a larger 220 - metre dock so engineers could continue the awesome project super-secretive : the £ 400million megayacht , known only as @entity108 , is rumoured to have been commissioned by the @entity39 @entity145 watch video of the range of yachts built by @entity31 :			1
