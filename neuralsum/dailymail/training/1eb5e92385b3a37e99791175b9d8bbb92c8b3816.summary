in any discussion about spiralling transfer fees , it is always the richest clubs that get the blame			0
@entity5 , or @entity6 , are typically held responsible for the fact that clubs in the lower leagues are crippled by an expensively hostile market			1
yet the most inflationary transfer this summer , without a doubt , is @entity14 ’s move from @entity15 to @entity16 for £ 11million			2
these are the deals that will be quoted when @entity32 open negotiations for @entity33 at @entity34 , not the £ 75m paid by @entity19 for @entity17			0
relative to the @entity22 deal , @entity17 is a snip			2
@entity14 ’s move , meanwhile , jacks up prices in domestic football , forcing clubs abroad for value as opportunities for @entity44 players decrease			1
hot property : @entity17 moved to @entity19 from @entity27 for £ 75million earlier this month			0

@entity5 and @entity6 are usually held responsible for the hostile market
@entity14 moved from @entity15 to @entity16 for £ 11m , and @entity22 looks set to join @entity23 for £ 14m
relative to the @entity22 deal , @entity17 **'s** £ 75m move to @entity19 is a snip
@entity14 **'s** move also hikes prices in @entity57 , forcing clubs abroad
