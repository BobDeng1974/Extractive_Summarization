@entity2 football 's new golden boy @entity0 has vowed to try and turn the other cheek if he becomes the target for @entity7 's hatchet - men this season			1
@entity0 was the one @entity8 player who returned from their @entity10 failure in @entity11 with his stock greatly enhanced and the teenage star will carry the hopes of @entity16 fans still grieving the loss of @entity18			1
but with reputation comes responsibility			0
sent - off for his country in @entity2 against @entity22 this summer for a bad tackle of his own , @entity0 knows opponents are looking out for him now and wants to take inspiration from @entity26 and @entity27 who have learned to cope with being kicked regularly by over-zealous markers			1
laughing about it : @entity16 winger @entity0 ( left ) has admitted he needs to learn in dealing with physical approaches from defenders dynamic duo : under the management of @entity34 , @entity0 blossomed into one of the @entity7 's finest wingers last term time for a chuckle : @entity0 is currently in the @entity39 with @entity16 as part of their pre-season tour ' the physical side is part of the game , ' said @entity0 , whose speed and balance can make a chump out of any defender			1
' you are going to get defenders who want to let you know they are there , make you feel their presence			2
' i 've got to keep my temper , stay calm and try to play the game the way i think it should be played			1
if i can play well and score , they will know it 's not all about being physical			1
' i will definitely be keeping a cool temperament and doing my best for the team			0
' for someone 5ft6ins tall and of slight build , @entity0 can handle himself			1
he 's already picked up eight bookings in his fledgling career and his red card against @entity22 in june – when he slid in recklessly against @entity68 – was described as a ' lesson ' for the youngster by international boss @entity71			0
@entity0 says his challenge is to let his talent do the talking whatever the provocation			1
' if you are getting kicked a lot on the pitch , it must mean that you are a threat to the opposition because they want to stop you as early as possible , ' he said			0
' in this game , you 've just got to look at people like @entity26 or @entity27 , they get kicked all the time , i think they are doing something right			1
' i 'm not saying i 'm a @entity26 or @entity27 but it 's the same that if you are in an attacking position , defenders will try to kick you			1
it is just part of the game , you just have to get on with it and try to do your best			2
' shining star : @entity0 scored a stunning goal for @entity16 in their recent pre-season friendly with @entity96 one to watch : @entity0 is congratulated by team - mates following his goal against @entity96 at the @entity99 in @entity100 there is a willingness to moderate his performances too and not try to win matches single - handedly every time he picks up the ball			1
' i do like taking defenders on and making things happen , a goal or assist , but i need to try and mix my game up , ' he acknowledges			1
' it 's not always about trying to take the man on , sometimes to try and play one or two touches , get in behind defenders and be a handful that way			1
it 's a challenge for the new season			0
' @entity16 beat a number of top clubs to win @entity122 - born @entity0 's signature from @entity123 at 15			1
he has won rave reviews as winger but recently has shown he can be a dynamic @entity126 too			1
he was the catalyst for @entity16 's 5 - 1 win against @entity129 , one of their best performances from a season that saw them come close to winning the @entity7 , and impressed centrally at the @entity10 when @entity71 picked him there against @entity134			1
diplomatically , he insists he is happy to play wherever manager @entity34 picks him			2
but there 's a twinkle in his eye when he discusses the central playmaker 's role where you can dictate the flow of the game			2
three @entity8 positive : in an otherwise disastrous @entity10 for @entity8 , @entity0 was one of the few stars to emerge with his reputation intact for the @entity8 learning experience : @entity0 was sent off in a @entity146 friendly against @entity22 ' the manager has trusted me a little to play the @entity126 role			1
i 'd like to see myself inside more , becoming educated in that position , ' he said			2
' if i can get that bit more freedom , hopefully it would take my game to the next level and improve my goals - to - game ratio			2
' the point about goals is important			0
@entity18 scored 31 last season and others will have to step up if the club are to have another tilt at the title and do well in the @entity168			0
@entity34 has signed five players this summer with more on the way but @entity0 also wants to improve on the 10 goals he scored last season			1
' @entity18 was a big part of last year , a massive part to be fair , ' he admits			0
' you 've got @entity177 ( @entity176 ) up front and the new player , but we all have to contribute to make up the missing goals			0
' that is part of the next step for me , to improve my goal scoring			0
not to put too much pressure on myself but that is definitely the challenge for me			0
' every few years , a young @entity2 player comes along with complete self - belief that separates it from arrogance			0
@entity194 had it , @entity196 had it , @entity0 has it			2
he does n't turn 20 til december by which time he will probably have racked up 100 games for one of the most famous clubs in @entity202			0
if @entity16 do n't sit down with him about a new contract this season , the likes of @entity204 would be interested			2
is he shocked by the speed of his progress ? apparently not			0
' my aim was always to be in and around the first team as soon as possible , ' he said			0
' the club would give me a yearly schedule , @entity214 , reserves , first - team and i 'm grateful a manager like @entity34 came in and given me a chance			0
' but i would n't say it is a real surprise because it 's something i wanted , to play for a big club like this and show what i can do			0
' by his own admission , @entity0 was glad to leave @entity225 , his career might have taken a different path had he stayed			2
even at @entity228 , behavioural problems were bad enough for him to be asked to leave			0
turning the other cheek was n't part of his life back then – but it 's needed now .			0
