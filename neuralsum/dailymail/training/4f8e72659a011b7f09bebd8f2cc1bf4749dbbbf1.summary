@entity0 can protect women against @entity2 's – providing it is taken at the menopause , according to researchers			1
a study showed women who began taking hormone replacement therapy within five years of the menopause cut their risk of the disease by a third			1
but the findings suggest that if @entity0 is started in later life , it could give women a greater risk of developing the condition , leading some experts to believe there is a ' window of opportunity ' when the benefits are maximised			1
the study found that women who began @entity0 within five years of menopause had a 30 per cent lower risk of @entity25 s dementia than those who had not used @entity0 the researchers at @entity28 , in @entity26 , followed 1,768 women aged 65 and over for 11 years , recording a history of their @entity0 use and the date their menopause began			1
a total of 1,105 women had used some form of hormone therapy , the report in journal @entity32 noted			2
during the study , 176 women developed alzheimer 's disease , including 87 of the women who had taken hormone therapy compared with 89 of the 663 who had not			1
the study found that women who began @entity0 within five years of the menopause had a 30 per cent lower risk of @entity2 's dementia than those who had not used @entity0			1
many people with dementia are not dying in the place they want to , says @entity53 research			0
although two out of three people want to die in their own homes , in 2010 only six per cent of people with dementia did			0
this is compared to 21 per cent of the general population , says a report , @entity61 : dying well with dementia			0
it found in many cases people with dementia had not discussed their wishes around death and dying so no - one was able to put services in place to make them a reality			0
the high needs of people with dementia also mean it is difficult for carers to cope at home and there are difficulties in coordinating care			0
the report said people with dementia are often not treated with dignity at the end of their lives			0
one man had a dislocated shoulder for 11 days until his death despite his family raising concerns with numerous doctors			0
the risk was unchanged among other hormone users who began treatment more than five years after the menopause			2
and the protective effect was even larger in women using @entity0 for ten years or more			2
but the risk of dementia among women who had started @entity0 when they were at least 65 , which , depending on the individual , can be more than a decade after the menopause , was almost doubled			1
the protective effect from @entity0 may come from boosting supplies of the hormone oestrogen , which is thought to play a key role in keeping the brain healthy , or the improvement in heart risk factors linked to @entity0			2
earlier this month a study found @entity0 can reduce the risk of heart attacks and heart failure			2
in the @entity114 , women in their 50s are told to use @entity0 drugs short - term and for no longer than five years			0
dr @entity116 , head of research at @entity118 , said : ' previous research into @entity0 has shown mixed results , but this useful study suggests the timing of hormone use may be critical for either raising or reducing the risk of @entity2 's			1
' more work is needed to understand this link and help women make informed decisions about whether to start @entity0 , but these findings could be important for guiding future research			0

*scientists* found ' critical window ' near menopause where hormone therapy could be beneficial
women who began taking hormone replacement therapy within five years of menopause cut their risk of @entity2 's disease by a third
however , if @entity0 was taken later it could raise risk of developing dementia
