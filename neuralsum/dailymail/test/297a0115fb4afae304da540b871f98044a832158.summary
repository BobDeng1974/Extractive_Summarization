@entity0 is getting inside teammate @entity2 ’s head as the @entity4 bids to win his first @entity6 title , according to two time winner @entity7			1
@entity2 accused @entity8 team - mate @entity0 of deliberately compromising his race at last weekend ’s @entity10 by slowing down but @entity7 said the @entity13 driver ’s tactics , which saw him win a third consecutive @entity10 ahead of the @entity4 , were entirely legitimate			1
‘ if you are leading a race that 's a fantastic place to be and what goes in your mind when you are leading into finish the race first , ’ said @entity7			1
@entity0 celebrates his win with the @entity8 team , but @entity2 appears less pleased with 2nd @entity2 accused @entity0 of being selfish by driving too slow and compromising his second position @entity0 crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in @entity27 ‘ so you do everything with the team in the right way so you are able to finish the race first			1
if you have to save tyres , brakes , engine , gearbox whatever it is , that 's what you do			2
' you do n't think about the guy behind you , what he is feeling , how his car is handling or how you want his car to handle at the end of the race you just take care of your own stuff			2
‘ i have been in this situation with @entity48 [ @entity49 ] where where i was much quicker than him and he was definitely challenging me in a very interesting way , ’ added @entity7			1
‘ @entity53 and @entity2 are going through at the moment , they are having a very difficult challenge , already last year and there are challenges continuing this year between them			1
@entity2 responded to a fan who accused him of ' crying ' after he complained about @entity0 former world champion @entity7 says @entity0 was well within his rights to look after himself @entity0 celebrates with with his trophy and bottle of champagne after his race win ' they are the drivers with the best possible chance of winning at the moment			1
it requires a lot of nerves from the drivers to be able to be a good racing driver and not to start fighting because it does n't make any difference			0
’ @entity0 , who is bidding to win a third world championship title this season , has out - qualified and out - raced @entity2 in all three grand prix and @entity2 will likely be feeling the pressure according to @entity7			1
‘ @entity2 has definitely got big pressure on him , ’ said @entity7 , ‘ he does n't know how it feels to be a world champion and does n't know what confidence a world championship generates inside you when you are racing driver			1
‘ he is still hunting that feeling			0
he wants to win but first he has to beat @entity53 but @entity2 is a great driver and if you look at the qualifying result at the last grand prix the time difference was hardly nothing			1
i do n't say that pole position is the key point to win a grand prix certainly it helps to start in pole			2
’ @entity53 , many congratulations			0
was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from @entity99 and , also , can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up ? were you aware that @entity2 was getting so backed - up towards @entity103 ? @entity104 : i was n’t controlling his race , i was controlling my own race but , great race , i ’m really happy			1
definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the @entity113 were very , very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres			2
so , today the real goal was to manage the tyres			0
and , as i said , my goal was to look after my car			0
i had no real threat from @entity2 through the whole race			1
so , i just managed it and got to really enjoy it , to be honest			0
a few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop , which i really enjoyed			0
ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole , full practice sessions , on my side of the garage at least			2
and it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race			2
so really happy , and yeah , kinda excited			0
q : @entity2 , can you talk us through your view of the race today			1
started second , finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at times under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe ? @entity150 : no. it ’s just now interesting to hear from you , @entity53 , that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front , and necessarily that was compromising my race			0
driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that @entity103 was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for @entity103 to try that early pit - stop to try and jump me			1
and then i had to cover him			0
so , first of all it was unnecessarily close with @entity103 as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because i had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer			0
so i ’m unhappy about that , of course , today			0
other than that , not much to say			0
q : @entity53 , would you like to respond ? @entity104 : not really ! my job is not to … it ’s not my job to look after @entity2 ’s race			1
my job ’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that ’s what i did			0
i did n’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up			0
i just was focussing on myself			0
if @entity2 wanted to get by he could have tried but he did n’t .			2
