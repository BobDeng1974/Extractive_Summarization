what was supposed to be a moment for @entity2 to revel in @entity4 ’s famous victory descended into an incredible personal attack as @entity6 launched an expletive - laden outburst against his former boss			1
‘ where is the @entity15 media ? i want to speak to the @entity15 media , ’ said the long - haired @entity10 prop as he stormed into the post-game press conference			1
he then lashed out at @entity17 and slammed the @entity19 club for the way they dealt with his move to @entity24 in june 2013			1
@entity6 , who made 149 appearances during seven seasons with @entity4 , used the vilest epithet to describe the club ’s director of rugby following suggestions that he left the club for a pay rise			1
he also claimed his former employers no longer treat staff with respect			0
‘ he was saying that people go for the money but he has a lot of f * * * * * * squad players who get paid as well			0
i paid my own f * * * * * * money to leave this club			2
i do n’t need the money to play rugby			0
i love this game and i used to love this club			2
‘ i still love this club but i never want to speak with @entity54 any more			2
if i hate you , if you have been a * * * * , i will never speak to you again			0
i do n’t hate anyone			0
i just do n’t like * * * * s. ’ the rise of @entity62 tighthead @entity60 effectively ended @entity6 ’s tenure as the club ’s premier prop			1
@entity60 got the better of his former team - mate in sunday night ’s @entity68 tie and the hosts won an early scrum penalty to take the lead , with promising @entity73 youngster @entity72 kicking 20 points to go with @entity76 ’s 20th - minute try			2
@entity2 ( above ) attempted to diffuse the situation after @entity6 expletive - laden post-match outburst @entity24 ’s points came through tries from @entity82 and @entity83 , with @entity86 fly - half @entity84 kicking his side into losing bonus point territory			1
but the significance of the result was overshadowed by @entity6 ’s outburst			1
‘ i never had the opportunity to defend myself when i left , ’ added the 33 - year - old			1
‘ @entity54 talks about the money , but the real reason i left this club is because you have @entity60 and you have me			2
@entity60 paid gets paid half the money from the @entity99 and i am foreign			0
' you have a good f * * * * * * tighthead prop playing for @entity62 and a hairy , fat @entity10			1
the thing is that they made it look like i went for the money but i paid £ 100,000 from my pocket to leave this club because i want to play rugby			0
former @entity111 lock @entity76 scored a crucial 20th minute try for @entity4 against @entity24 ‘ i always love this club and i wanted to clarify and talk face to face , which is something @entity54 never does			1
i think in the last few years people are getting sacked and this club was not like that before			0
they used to respect people , now they act like nothing is going on			0
that is not from the club , that is from the guys in charge			0
’ @entity2 had already addressed the media before the outburst but returned and attempted to defuse the situation after @entity6 returned to the changing rooms			1
‘ i ’ve a lot of time for @entity132 — he ’s a fantastic player and icon for this club and a great guy , ’ said the @entity4 coach			1
‘ i always said i would pick on merit and i did			0
@entity60 was third choice behind @entity137 and @entity132 and worked hard to become first choice			0
@entity132 was released a year early and we agreed a transfer fee with @entity24			2
i do n’t want him to feel bitter towards us			0
one day we ’ll have a beer together and smile about it			0
’ @entity4 fans have complained about alleged abusive comments made by @entity24 full - back @entity145			1
@entity4 are likely to investigate the claims this week			2
@entity24 came roaring back into the contest , however , with winger @entity82 scorching over in the corner the @entity24 pack put the squeeze on @entity4 but @entity2 's men held on for a famous victory			1

@entity6 started at tighthead for @entity24 during his side 's *25* - *21* defeat to @entity4 at @entity158
