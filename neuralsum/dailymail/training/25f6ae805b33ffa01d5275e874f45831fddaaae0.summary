@entity0 has vowed to wield a second veto in @entity2 if @entity3 and @entity4 insist on pushing ahead with an @entity6 - wide financial transaction tax @entity0 has vowed to wield a second veto in @entity2 if @entity3 and @entity4 insist on pushing ahead with an @entity6 - wide financial transaction tax			1
the prime minister said countries calling for a levy were welcome to implement it within their own borders – but added that to impose it across the @entity6 without the backing of other major economies would harm businesses and jobs			0
the plan to impose a so - called ‘ @entity21 tax ’ could cripple the @entity22 , through which the vast majority of @entity2 financial transactions go			1
mr @entity0 spoke hours before @entity3 announced it would try to implement a financial transaction tax of its own , even if @entity6 leaders can not agree on a tax to cover the whole union			1
the country ’s housing minister @entity30 said yesterday that a bill on the tax – which would only cover @entity3 – could be put to parliament as soon as next month			0
mr @entity0 is entirely happy with the prospect of @entity3 going it alone because it would mean their financial sector would be put at a disadvantage to the @entity41 ’s			1
however , @entity41 would be able to veto an @entity6 - wide tax because it would need the support of all 27 members			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ if the @entity3 themselves want to go ahead with a transactions tax in their own country then they should be free to do so			1
‘ we actually have stamp duty on share transactions in @entity41 and yet we have one of the most competitive and successful financial services markets anywhere			0
‘ but the idea of a new @entity2 tax when you are not going to have that tax put in place in other places ... i will block it unless the rest of the world all agreed at the same time that we were all going to have some sort of tax			0
’ @entity3 president @entity66 and @entity4 chancellor @entity67			0
@entity3 announced it would try to implement a financial transaction tax of its own , even if @entity6 leaders can not agree on a tax to cover the whole union the prime minister 's determination to fall in line with the rest of the world has left him in a trickier position when it comes to @entity78 contributions , however			1
after his pledge not to go above a £ 10billion ceiling , the @entity79 revealed today that he is prepared to give 30bn euros more to help the eurozone if countries such as @entity84 and @entity85 do the same			2
mr @entity0 tried to play down concerns @entity41 will end up excluded from decisions affecting the single market under a new treaty being thrashed out in @entity90			1
the latest draft of a fiscal accord designed to shore up the crisis - hit eurozone specifically talks about ‘ deeper integration in the internal market ’			0
it also suggests @entity6 institutions would be involved in policing tough new deficit rules			0
a bid to apply new rules across the @entity6 was vetoed by the prime minister last month – but @entity41 found itself alone among the 27 member states in opposing the proposal			0
@entity41 may end up giving billions of pounds more to the @entity78 to help bail out eurozone countries			1
after previously refusing to pledge more than the £ 10bn approved by @entity107 in july , @entity0 could be ready to change his position , insiders said			1
they believe that if countries such as @entity85 and @entity111 increase their support to the @entity78 to help it deal with the eurozone crisis , the prime minister is likely to follow suit			2
' i 'd expect the issue of resources to be discussed at the @entity122 finance ministers ' meeting , ' mr @entity0 's spokesman told the @entity79			1
@entity41 is already under pressure from the single currency countries to increase its @entity78 contributions by 30bn euros			2
the prime minister has so far refused to join the eurozone members who have committed an extra 150bn euros to the @entity78 to assist @entity2			2
but it now looks possible that he could commit to giving more money on an ad hoc basis , in a move that is bound to infuriate eurosceptic @entity133 mps			0
@entity78 experts have pointed out that getting assistance from other countries will depend on @entity2 demonstrating its efforts to prop up its struggling countries			2
extra resources would help supplement an @entity78 war chest of about $ 348bn , which is currently too small for a major rescue of @entity142 and @entity143			0
but mr @entity0 could have trouble persuading @entity107 to increase @entity41 's contributions to the @entity78			1
the last time he tried to do so , 30 conservative mps joined forces against the proposal with @entity149 .			0

' @entity21 ' tax could cripple the @entity22
but mr @entity0 ready to give billions more to @entity78 for assisting eurozone
