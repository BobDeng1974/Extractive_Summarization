@entity0 and @entity1 both enjoyed gentle re-introductions into the game as @entity5 ’s under 21 side drew 1 - 1 at @entity6 , although @entity7 and @entity8 both limped off			1
@entity10 forward @entity9 has been out of action since february with an ankle injury after leaving @entity13 on crutches			0
but he was up and running again in the @entity14 , helping set up @entity5 ’s goal for @entity16 although his overall performance was rusty to say the least and he was replaced just after the hour			2
defender @entity1 has been out for six games due to suspension following his spitting incident with @entity21 at @entity22 back in march			0
@entity5 goalscorer @entity16 ( centre left ) is congratulated by @entity24 ( left ) and @entity0 ( centre right ) @entity16 levelled the scoreline in the 32nd minute by wriggling past @entity6 's defence before scoring past the helpless @entity28 @entity29 put his side in the lead after 18 minutes after getting on the end of a cross by @entity6 playmaker @entity34 @entity6 forward @entity29 runs off in celebration after finding a way past @entity5 reserve goalkeeper @entity37 @entity5 right back @entity7 had to be taken off in the 44th minute after sustaining a rib injury during the reserve match @entity6 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity28 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity34 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 75 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 68 ) , @entity48 ; @entity29 subs not used : @entity50 , @entity51 goal : @entity16 32 @entity5 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity53 ; @entity7 ( @entity54 44 ) , @entity1 , @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity24 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity16 , @entity8 ( @entity59 54 ) ; @entity9 ( @entity60 62 ) subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 goal : @entity29 18 referee : @entity67 and despite his frustrating absence , @entity1 looked solid enough in a 90 minute appearance where he went close from a set piece before the break			1
however he will feel he should have denied @entity29 the opener for @entity6			2
@entity9 and @entity1 along with @entity7 and @entity55 were all in the @entity5 side that lost 5 - 3 to @entity6 at the @entity74 back in september and keen to banish the memories of one of their lowest points of the season			1
@entity5 could have taken an early lead with @entity24 seeing a shot deflect wide from @entity83 ’s cross			2
however it was @entity6 who took the lead in the 19th minute , @entity34 ’s tricks out wide enabled him to cross for @entity29 , the highly - rated @entity87 and @entity88 international , who powered home			2
it would be harsh to blame @entity1 for the goal but @entity29 was his man and he will feel he should have done better			0
in response @entity5 went close through @entity8 who shot wide from distance while @entity96 had to do well to push @entity6 midfielder @entity43 ’s effort around the post			1
the visitors started to press with @entity28 ’s save keeping out a @entity24 effort			0
@entity9 , who was an unused sub at @entity102 on saturday , had been virtually anonymous in the opening half an hour with few touches of the ball			0
but he played his part in the leveller laying the ball off for @entity16 who burst through the @entity6 defence and finished well on 32 minutes			2
@entity109 was hit by another injury when @entity7 was forced off just before the break with an apparent rib injury after an aerial collision with @entity34			0
@entity7 looks in pain as @entity6 's @entity34 checks on the @entity117 defender during the first half of the draw at the @entity74 @entity7 had to be replaced by @entity54 shortly before the half - time interval despite managing to get back onto his feet @entity5 winger @entity8 was also taken off with an injury during the reserve encounter at @entity6 's @entity74 @entity9 finally got his opportunity in first half stoppage time but his effort from outside the area was well saved by @entity28			1
and from the resulting @entity8 corner , @entity28 made an even better stop to push @entity1 ’ header over the bar			0
@entity7 ’s replacement @entity54 saw a shot deflect wide at the start of the second half before @entity9 ’s next involvement was a lay - off that was intercepted by @entity46 in the area before it reached its intended target			1
a frustrating evening of injuries for @entity5 continued when @entity8 went off with what appeared to be a leg injury following another seemingly innocuous aerial collision with @entity34			2
@entity9 was substituted on 62 minutes , going off to warm applause from all present at the @entity74 which had one side opened			1
it may not have been the goalscoring return he wanted , and indeed he looked fairly quiet , but it was the game time under his belt that he needed as he looks to score the goals that would seal a @entity155 spot for @entity157 ’s side			0
you would still suspect a start at @entity160 on sunday would be far too early for @entity9 – but maybe not for @entity1			1
the @entity161 international still had work to do late in the game as he marshalled a defence that came up against @entity34 , keen to force his way back into @entity168 ’s plans , who twice went close to finding the net			0
a ball across the box from @entity29 also caused one or two alarms for the @entity5 back four but @entity1 can generally be pleased with his evening ’s work			1
@entity24 could have won it for the visitors late in the game but dragged a left - footed effort wide under pressure from @entity41			0
and he went in even closer deep into stoppage time as his effort was kept out by @entity28 from @entity83 ’s cross from the left			0
@entity8 awaits treatment from @entity5 's medical staff before going off injured during the @entity187 21 encounter @entity5 first team striker @entity9 ( centre ) was named in a strong under 21 side as he aimed to work on his fitness @entity9 , pictured before the under 21 clash at the @entity74 , was an unused substitute during @entity5 's defeat by @entity102 @entity5 forward @entity9 played 62 minutes before being replaced by reserve team midfielder @entity60 @entity5 defender @entity55 , who came on for the last 10 minutes against @entity102 , also made an appearance @entity57 captained @entity5 despite the presence of first team stars @entity9 , @entity7 , @entity55 , @entity8 and @entity1 @entity5 centre back @entity1 will be hoping to be involved against @entity160 after serving a six - match ban for spitting the @entity5 ace and @entity10 international warms up ahead of the under 21 match against @entity6 on monday night @entity187 21 boss @entity202 watches on as his side face a strong @entity5 side including @entity9 and @entity8			1

@entity0 , @entity8 , @entity1 , @entity55 , @entity24 and @entity7 all started for @entity5
@entity5 first team stars @entity8 and @entity7 sustained injuries during the 1 - 1 draw at the @entity74
@entity9 *boosted* his chances of starting against @entity160 on sunday by playing 62 minutes of under 21 encounter
both goals came during the first half as @entity16 cancelled out @entity6 forward @entity29 's opener
