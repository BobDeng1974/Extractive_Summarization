she said : ' i think at the time i was actually quite flattered by his advances			0
he was really humorous , he made me cry with laughter			0
' ms @entity3 started visiting @entity15 near his probation hostel in @entity52 , @entity53 , every fortnight			1
she said : ' he was attracted to me , he made it clear			0
' the first time she brought @entity15 to her village home near @entity60 , @entity26 , he was friendly and got on well with her children			1

@entity94 , counsel for @entity15 's family , told her : ' you knew , did n't you , that you had to maintain professional boundaries ?
