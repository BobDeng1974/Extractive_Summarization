savers investing in the new tax - free @entity2 are being blocked from receiving the most attractive interest rates , it has emerged			1
just days ahead of the launch of the chancellor ’s flagship savings policy , many banks and building societies are preventing customers from transferring existing @entity11 funds into the new top - rate , easy access accounts			1
pensioners and savers who had hoped to switch to the highest rates to boost their income could now find themselves denied the chance to make more than £ 500 extra a year			1
pensioners and savers who had hoped to switch to the highest rates to boost their income could now find themselves denied the chance to make more than £ 500 extra a year under current rules , savers can transfer up to £ 11,880 into a tax - free @entity11 ( @entity11 ) – only half of which can be cash			1
the new @entity26 , which launches on july 1 , will allow savers to put in up to £ 15,000 a year however they want , either in cash or shares			2
customers would normally be allowed to transfer money held at rival banks and building societies into their @entity11 but the huge rise in the allowance has prompted many providers to end the practice			1
nationwide , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 building societies are among those who have already slammed the door shut on @entity44 on some accounts – and there are fears more will follow			0
the lenders are saying that only new money can be invested in the @entity26 at table - topping rates of at least 1.5 per cent – worth at least £ 150 a year on £ 10,000 savings			1
savers would then have to keep nest eggs in other accounts on existing @entity55 – which average at about 1.18 per cent but are as low as 0.5 per cent			2
careful older savers who have invested the maximum allowed into a cash @entity11 every year since they were introduced in 1999 would have saved at least £ 57,540 by april 5 this year , excluding interest earned			1
on an interest rate of 0.5 per cent , they would earn £ 512.70 on all of their tax - free savings across the year			1
but at the higher rate they would earn £ 1,088.10 – £ 576.60 more			0
it comes just days ahead of the launch of chancellor @entity68 's flagship savings policy although @entity70 says all @entity11 accounts must allow customers to transfer their cash whenever they want , providers are not obliged to accept it			1
@entity75 , co-founder of @entity76 , said : ‘ with rates as low as they are , savers are absolutely desperate for a decent rate			2
‘ so you can understand their outrage when they see one , but which bans transfers			0
if you ’re a building society , this is a commercial decision – it ’ll simply cost you more to take on the bigger balances			0
’ one option for savers is to cash in some of their existing cash @entity87 , put it into their bank account , and apply for the full £ 15,000 rate at the more generous rate			1
but this can be an administrative nightmare – taking weeks to complete and losing interest in the process			0
@entity97 said record interest in its 1.5 per cent bonus @entity11 had triggered its curb on access			2
if it allowed transfers , it would not be able to offer the rate to as many customers , it said			0
@entity39 , which is state - backed and guarantees 100 per cent of savers ’ money , said accepting transfers into its popular 1.5 per cent @entity108 would risk breaching @entity110 rules about how it raises money from the public			2
@entity114 of price comparison site @entity116 said : ‘ we have created a savings wilderness , where banks and building societies simply do n’t want savers ’ cash			2
it means consumers need to be much more aggressive and change on even the smallest interest rate difference – even half a percentage point			0
‘ my concern is that unhappy savers hunting for higher rates will end up taking on more risk with a retail bond , say , or peer to peer , and wo n’t get the protection they want or need			0
’ meanwhile , providers continue to cut rates for new savers			0
@entity139 has trimmed the rate on its cash isa from 1.25 per cent to 1 per cent			0
@entity143 ’s @entity142 is falling to 1 per cent from 1.25 per cent next month .			0
