by @entity0 @entity1 laid down a @entity3 marker as they thrashed @entity5 51 - 20 at @entity6 to retain the @entity7			1
the @entity1 missed out on what would have been a record 18th consecutive @entity10 win as they drew 12 - 12 against the @entity5 last week , but they enjoyed exacting their revenge back on home soil			2
@entity13 scored two tries while @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 also crashed over for the hosts , who also notched a penalty try , while @entity21 and @entity22 touched down for the visitors			1
triumph : @entity1 captain @entity13 lifts the @entity7 after victory over @entity5 dominant : the @entity1 ran out comfortable 51 - 20 winners at @entity6 it actually started well for @entity29 's side , who have not won at @entity6 for 28 years , as a lofted kick off from @entity32 created a penalty opportunity as the recalled @entity34 strayed offside			1
@entity32 took his chance to give the @entity5 the lead , but that just seemed to irritate their hosts who responded with a forceful black tidal wave to pen @entity5 back in their own 22			0
they exhibited the kind of precise offloading and incisive running lines that were ruled out by bad weather last week , but ultimately they were made to settle for a penalty as @entity51 levelled the score			0
a further kick from the @entity55 fly - half nudged his side in front before @entity13 had a mad moment and was sin binned for hands in a ruck , with @entity32 taking full advantage to make it 6 - 6			0
first up : @entity15 scored @entity1 's second after their penalty try going over : @entity16 touching down the @entity1 second try just after half time despite being a man down it was the @entity1 , who also had two men binned last week , that seized the initiative during this period and @entity51 kept the scoreboard ticking over with another penalty			1
under mounting pressure @entity5 lock @entity78 was sent for a spell on the sidelines to equal the numbers and , in his absence , the @entity1 pack crushed @entity5 's scrum to earn a penalty try			2
@entity51 and @entity15 then combined to devastating effect as they ran almost the length of the field before the @entity90 winger made it an incredible 24 tries in as many @entity10			0
@entity51 added the extras to make it 23 - 6 at the break			0
spot kicker : @entity51 ( left ) converted eight of nine attempts in a confident display touchdown : captain @entity13 celebrates two tries in quick succession early in the second half conclusive : and @entity17 rounding off the scoring in the last minute of the game @entity16 's try was probably the highlight of the day as he latched on to an intelligent chip inside from @entity15 to finish off a fine sweeping move that had @entity5 scrambling from deep			1
captain @entity13 more than made up for his spell in the bin with two tries in five minutes , with @entity51 also completing five out of five conversion attempts , before @entity5 hit back with a three - minute salvo of their own			1
@entity21 and @entity22 both ran in fine efforts just after the hour - mark , with @entity32 adding the extras , but it was rightly the @entity1 who would have the last word			2
once again down to 14 men after @entity123 was pinged for hands at a ruck , @entity17 went over in the final minute on his home ground and @entity128 added the late conversion			0
the result means @entity5 , who have not won the @entity7 since 2002 , will have to wait until next year 's shortened @entity3 for another attempt to lure the trophy across the @entity134 .			0

@entity1 thrash @entity5 51 - 20 in @entity3 at @entity6
@entity13 ( 2 ) , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity137 score tries for the @entity1 whilst @entity51 converts eight out of nine kicks
@entity21 and @entity22 go over for @entity5
