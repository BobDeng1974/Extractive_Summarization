there are lots of theories on how to beat jetlag , but a new app claims it can work out how travellers can adjust to new time zones faster			1
researchers behind @entity8 - in a study partly funded by the @entity10 - say they have developed mathematical formulas that calculate light exposure			1
if it works , it means holidaymakers travelling long - haul will be able to use the free app to work out how much daylight they need and when to change their body clocks quicker			1
the clock is regulated by the bodily senses - most importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark			2
when we work late , or travel to different time zones , the light our body expects to see - based on how long we 've been awake - for example , is different , and this causes our body clock to fall out of sync			1
this causes the feeling of jet lag			0
@entity47 , @entity48 math professor who led the research , said : ' if you get light in the wrong time or wrong way , it 'll send you the wrong direction			2
' a master biological clock , called a circadian rhythm , regulates when we become sleepy and when we 're more alert			0
when people travel across time zones , the body clock has to reset itself - with light exposure being its strongest regulator			1
the @entity48 team used two equations proven to predict someone 's circadian rhythm , and with computer modelling calculated different schedules of light exposure for more than 1,000 possible trips			1
it 's possible to customise a block of time each day when you should be in light , the brighter the better , and another when you should avoid it , @entity47 's team reported in the journal @entity80			2
for example , flying from @entity82 to @entity83 , which is five hours ahead , arriving at 11am @entity83 time , it 's generally thought that it would take a day per time zone to fully adjust			0
@entity88 : but the study suggests a three - day adjustment schedule			2
on the day after arrival , holidaymakers should make sure they get light exposure from 7.40am to 9pm ; on day two from 6.20am to 7.40pm ; and from 5am until 7.20pm on day 3			1
@entity94 , an @entity96 app , does the calculations			0
and if travellers do n't go outside or stay up later , it adjusts the advice			0
and holidaymakers can help with the research by submitting their data to a @entity48 study			0
' i think it makes sense , ' said dr @entity108 of the @entity110 's sleep disorder centre			0
' anything you could do to optimise your adjustment is welcome , without medications			0

researchers have calculated how light exposure *affects* body clocks
study for @entity8 app was part - funded by the @entity10
free app would be useful for travellers on long - haul flights
