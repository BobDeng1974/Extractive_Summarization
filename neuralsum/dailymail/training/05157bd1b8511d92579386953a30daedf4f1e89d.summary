a family of four who were all overweight have worked together to shed the pounds			2
the @entity2 , from @entity3 , have lost a total of 9st 13lbs between them in three months after deciding it was time to change their unhealthy lifestyles			1
the waistlines of parents @entity7 , 43 , and @entity8 , 45 , and their daughters @entity10 , 20 , and @entity11 , 18 , all increased after @entity7 was diagnosed with @entity15 , until they tipped the scales at a combined weight of 65 stone 3lbs			1
health back on track : @entity7 's weight rose to 14st 6lb after she was diagnosed with @entity15 , left , but now she 's dropped four dress sizes warning : @entity8 was told he could have a heart attack if he did n't lose weight and has since lost @entity24 , right @entity7 explains how the whole family 's health deteriorated after she began suffering from the symptoms of @entity15 , also known as chronic fatigue syndrome			1
she said : ' there are no words to explain the way i felt			0
the tiredness was like no other			0
i lost my job as a teaching assistant and the ability to care for my family			1
my husband @entity8 had to become my carer , helping me get out of bed , get dressed , eat and do all the things i used to do on my own			1
' i had always done the cooking ; cleaning and taking care of the family , but my illness meant i could n't do that anymore			2
' as time went on the family 's diet started to change and takeaways and processed food fast became the norm			1
self - esteem boost : @entity10 had less confidence when she was a size 16 , left , but now she 's a slim size 12 @entity8 , a train driver and also a crew manager for @entity60 fire and rescue service , said : ' it was easier for me to grab a takeaway on the way home from work , but the more often this happened the more the whole family relied on quick fix takeaways and snacks to keep them going			1
' @entity7 's weight rose to 14 stone 6lbs , dress size 20 , while @entity8 was 23 stone 9lb			1
meanwhile , their daughters @entity10 and @entity11 weighed 13 stone 2lbs and 14 stone respectively and were dress sizes 16 - 18			1

she said : ' i would always skip breakfast , not eat much during the day then eat badly in the evenings			0
' media apprentice @entity11 's eating habits were similar			1

rarely having breakfast and skipping lunch left me starving in the evening and i 'd end up eating into the late hours			0
i 'd snack as well , eating chocolate , crisps , chips , pasta and cereal			0
i hated exercise and spent most of my time in front of the television when i was n't at college			0
' happier : @entity11 , pictured before dieting left , said she loves being able to shop for smaller clothes now she dropped two dress sizes , right the sisters said their weight affected their confidence and happiness			1
@entity10 said : ' i would also skip nights out with friends			1
the truth is when you hate yourself so much ; you struggle with social situations and your lack of confidence makes you just want to hide away			2
' @entity11 agreed : ' because i was overweight , i did n't want to go out with my friends , they were all skinnier than me and i felt uncomfortable around them			1
i did n't feel good in anything i wore , i felt very unhappy			0
' the turning point came when @entity8 was told his obesity could send him to an early grave			1
he explains : ' our weight and waistlines obviously increased , but that was n't the only thing			2
i started to suffer with general aches and pains and was experiencing headaches and heartburn			0
it actually turned out to be much more serious than that and my gp told me that i was at high risk of having a heart attack if i did n't change my diet and lifestyle			1
' @entity7 said they knew they had to do something to change their ways			1
' i hated seeing my girls sad and not wanting to go out and enjoy themselves and certainly did n't want @entity8 having a heart attack ' , she said			1
concerned about her father 's health after his warning from his gp , @entity10 called a family meeting where they all agreed to stick to a diet programme			1
@entity8 has whittled his waist from 48 to 44 inches and said it was all thanks to the family working together to achieve their goal @entity10 had heard about the ' body by @entity156 ' from a friend and the family decided to try it			1
@entity8 was initially reluctant but agreed to give it a go			1
he said : ' when the girls came home and told me all about body by @entity156 , i was a little skeptical			2
i hate diets and all the fuss and organising you have to do			0
plus with my work patterns nothing seemed to actually work			0
i either ate too much or not enough			0
' as a dutiful husband i listened and a lot of what @entity7 said began to appeal			2
i was very overweight and my health was suffering and i agreed to join the @entity156			0
' the family started with the 90 day challenge that involves replacing two meals a day with @entity178 shakes , only having filling snacks from their range and a home made low fat meal in the evening			2

she said : ' but the biggest thing for me personally is how i feel and how it 's improved my health			0

i feel more alert and as the pounds began to melt away i started to feel more confident and positive			0
' @entity8 , who now weighs 20 stone and has whittled his waist from 48 to 44 inches , said doing the challenge together made all the difference			2
he said : ' doing the challenge as a family has been great			2
we have encouraged and supported each other through the highs and lows			0
we are all on the same wavelength			0

it 's so nice when people give me compliments			0
' the family are now determined to stick to their new lifestyle by maintaining a healthy diet and exercising by joining a gym			1
@entity7 explained : ' we all are a lot more thoughtful as to what we eat			2
we do have treats but actually our food is so much better			0
we still eat well but healthier versions of previous meals			0
a family favourite is fajitas â€“ the chicken is baked with no fat and the vegetables are roasted with a spray of low cal fry light			2
we have a tortilla each or @entity10 and i like to use romaine lettuce as a wrap for a healthier choice			2
then top with salsa or i make a low cal yoghurt dressing with chopped mint			2
' we also make curries from scratch instead of a sauce from a jar			0
and we have brown rice instead of white and we portion control our meals			0
' we do n't add fat to food , we roast , bake or grill the meat , the same with vegetables			0
if we have a sauce it 's tomato based as they are less fattening			0
' we 've cut out bread and have very few potatoes but as a treat we still have our roast dinners			0
we 've found just making these small changes have helped			0
' @entity156 were so impressed with their combined weightloss of @entity283 they named them winners of the family weightloss competition			1
@entity7 said they were delighted by the recognition but added : ' the best prize of all is having my family back to the way we used to be			1
our weight - loss has given us the new found confidence we needed to get back on track			2
