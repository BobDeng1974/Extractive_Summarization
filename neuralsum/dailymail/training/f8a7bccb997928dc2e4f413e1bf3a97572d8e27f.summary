the @entity15 feminist group @entity1 : upsetting @entity17 , continued its crusade against @entity7 's secrets by carrying out its ' operation panty drop ' the activists are fighting what they call a ' culture of rape ' and take issue with the messages such as ' sure thing ' emblazoned across the front of @entity7 's @entity6 underwear			1
over the weekend @entity30 , 26 , and @entity31 , 27 , along with a number of ' consent enthusiasts ' launched co-ordinated strikes against the lingerie store , sneaking in thongs emblazoned with ' @entity37 means no ' and placing them alongside the official lingerie line			1
' what we ’re doing is one tactic within a bunch of necessary tactics to change our culture , ' @entity30 told the @entity46			2
earlier this month the group tried to convince @entity15 fashion media that @entity50 's pink line was launching a special collection of sexual consent - themed underwear , sending out a fake press release and launching a fake website under the @entity7 's secret name			1
in its original press release , @entity50 loves @entity58 claimed to be a new @entity50 line that ' promotes consent to fight rape in new panties			2
' the @entity50 loves consent website , with a @entity7 's @entity6 copyright notice on the bottom and the brand 's logo at the top , features a model wearing underwear with the phrase ' @entity72 '			2
the line has its own @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , and @entity77 , and the website claims to have more than five milliion members who have joined the ' consent revolution '			2
the website also shows how the @entity50 pink line has evolved with ' @entity83 ' sections that read : ' then we loved styles that were all about rape culture			0
now we love styles that are all about consent ! catch the changes hitting stores this holiday season			1
' sexual consent campaign : feminist group force has launched ' operation panty drop ' , putting fake @entity50 thongs with the words ' @entity72 ' next to real @entity7 's @entity6 underwear that say ' @entity97 ' the website also has a facts box which reads : ' by the time women in the @entity15 graduate from college , one in four will have been raped			1
' every 21 hours someone is raped on a college campus			0
women are twice as likely to be raped in their lifetime than to develop breast cancer			0
' when @entity110 's @entity109 spoke to @entity111 , who says she is the ' @entity112 with @entity50 's new @entity50 loves consent line , ' she said she was working for @entity50			0
however a @entity115 spokesperson ( which owns @entity50 ) , rebuffed these claims , saying : ' this is not an official @entity50 campaign			0
we are looking into it			0
' the website is still active , and now that force has admitted it is behind the @entity58 campaign , it is taking to brick - and - mortar @entity50 stores to spread their message , putting its @entity58 underwear next to real @entity7 's @entity6 lingerie			1
according to the @entity1 website , it wants ' customers who had n’t heard about @entity50 loves consent on the internet to stumble upon it in stores			1
' despite the unwanted attention from @entity1 , @entity50 continued with its swim line shoot in @entity135 over the weekend			0
models @entity136 and @entity138 sizzled on set during a steamy bikini photo shoot in the @entity141			0
life 's a beach : models @entity136 ( left ) and @entity138 ( right ) sizzled on set during a steamy bikini photo shoot in the @entity141 @entity146 - who is married to @entity148 dj @entity147 and has a one - year - old son named @entity150 - kept a hat on hand as she let her naturally wavy blonde locks fly in the wind			0
@entity155 revelled in showing off her fabulous figure in a range of different designs on the tropical paradise of @entity135			0
the mother - of - two of two 's physique was impossibly fit as she sauntered around in the surf in a variety of skimpy bikinis			0
according to the @entity1 website , it wants ' customers who had n’t heard about @entity50 loves consent on the internet to stumble upon it in stores			1
' @entity174 products : people that have come across the @entity58 website actually want to purchase the goods , however force are unable to sell them for obvious copyright reasons consent revolution : @entity1 hopes to draw attention to its cause through the hoax , pointing out that ' by the time women in the @entity15 graduate from college , one in four will have been raped ' it continues : ' last week , @entity50 shut down pinklovesconsent.com and @ loveconsent [ both the website and twitter handle are back up after the group fought the take down ] and we realized we need another method to spread the good news of consent			1
' apparently many people have stumbled upon them in stores actually want to buy them , including @entity110 's @entity199 , who praised @entity1 's efforts , wrote : ' my only complaint is that you ca n't actually buy anything off the site , because now i kind of want some underwear that says ' respect ' on the crotch			2
' @entity1 's website explains : ' when one shopper found them in the store in @entity214 , @entity215 , she said , " when i picked up this pair of underwear , it was fun because i knew that they had been planted in the store , because i knew about @entity222			0
' although force ca n't sell its prank underwear line because they would probably be sued ( @entity50 has already taken legal action to try and block the website , according to @entity1 ) , the group says : ' there never was a plan to sell consent - themed panties , [ it is ] just to create a consent revolution ! ' prank website : the @entity50 loves consent website , with a @entity7 's @entity6 copyright notice on the bottom and the brand 's logo at the top , features a model wearing underwear with the phrase ' @entity72 '			1
