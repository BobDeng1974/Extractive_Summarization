council officers have also gone undercover to carry out ‘ test purchases ’ at local escort agencies , it was revealed last night			1
snoopers : town halls have launched an astonishing 9,600 spying missions on the public in the past three years in other cases , tactics included obtaining phone records and trapping householders putting out rubbish early by using motion - activated cameras on lampposts and inside tin cans			1
families suspected of cheating school catchment area rules have been followed by council ‘ spies ’			2
civil liberties campaigners said was clear the hugely controversial @entity32 was being abused			1
they urged the @entity33 to stop merely ‘ tinkering ’ with the ‘ broken ’ law – passed ostensibly to fight terrorist fanatics – and subject it to an overhaul			0
in a painstaking report , which took months to compile from @entity41 requests , the big brother watch group discovered 345 councils had been authorised to use @entity32 9,607 times since 2009 – the equivalent of around nine spying missions a day			0
some 26 local authorities have used @entity32 to spy on dog owners to see whose animals were responsible for dog fouling			1
a further seven have used their powers to investigate suspected breaches of the smoking ban			2
@entity54 conducted a ‘ test purchase of dating agency services ’			2
bin cam : tactics include trapping householders putting out rubbish early by using motion - activated cameras on lampposts and inside tin cans many councils are targeting minor offences such as flouting the smoking ban , dog fouling and dropping litter @entity70 mounted an operation to check on the ‘ proper movement of pigs ’ and to investigate a ‘ fraudulent escort agency ’			1
@entity76 mounted three spying operations on a ‘ tarmac resurfacing service ’			2
@entity80 said @entity81 was the worst authority in the country for @entity32 investigations , with 315 in three years			0
alarmingly , seven public authorities refused under the @entity41 to disclose why or how often they have used the powers			2
they included the @entity88 and @entity89			1
the spies are called ‘ covert human intelligence sources ’			0
in many cases they will be council employees , such as dog wardens or trading standards officials , but school children are sometimes recruited to test for the sale of underage alcohol or cigarettes			1
@entity99 , the communities secretary , admitted councils had been misusing @entity32			0
@entity70 mounted an operation to investigate a ' fraudulent escort agency '			2
no action was taken he said : ‘ under @entity106 , councils seriously abused and over-used such snooping powers – for matters as trivial as spying on garden centres for selling pot plants ; snooping on staff for using work showers or monitoring shops for unlicensed parrots			1
’ mr @entity99 said the @entity33 had changed the law so that , from november , town halls will require the permission of a magistrate before they can launch snooping missions			0
but campaigners and experts – including the government ’s own watchdog – have questioned how much difference the change will make			2
@entity80 director @entity127 said : ‘ the current law is broken and before further surveillance powers are considered we need to fix the situation			1
‘ despite nearly ten thousand investigations in three years , most resulted in no action being taken , reinforcing the need for a comprehensive review			0
’ he wants the public to have a right to know they have been spied upon			0
currently , those who are found to be innocent never know they have been under surveillance			2
sir @entity143 , the government ’s @entity144 , said in his annual report : ‘ i still remain unconvinced that the government ’s proposal to require all local authorities to obtain the approval of a magistrate before they can use these powers will have much impact other than to introduce unnecessary bureaucracy into the process			1
’ however , @entity156 , of the @entity157 , said that without snooping powers it would be harder for councils to tackle rogue traders			0
the @entity80 report also laid bare the extent to which scores of other public bodies and quangos are spying on the public			0
@entity168 made use of @entity32 34,093 times between 2009 and 2012			0

the @entity88 refuses to reveal the tactics it uses to catch licence - fee evaders a string of public bodies including the @entity88 have refused to disclose how often they have used the spying powers			1
the lack of transparency was yesterday described as ‘ unacceptable ’ by communities secretary @entity99			0
hundreds of state bodies are entitled to use the @entity32 , which was introduced by the last @entity106 government			0
normally , they reveal under the @entity41 how many surveillance operations they have carried out and why			1
but the @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity190 , the @entity191 , the @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 all refused requests from the @entity196 campaign group			1
they claimed ‘ disclosure would , or would be likely to , prejudice a range of law enforcement functions and activities ’			0
in the @entity88 ’s case , this is likely to involve operations to catch licence - fee evaders			1
unlike town halls , under a change in the law later this year , public bodies will continue to be allowed to snoop without approval from a magistrate			0
mr @entity99 said : ‘ for public bodies , funded by and working for the taxpayer , to be using @entity32 yet so vociferously trying to avoid accountability is simply unacceptable			0
from the @entity88 to @entity89 , the @entity190 to @entity194 , public bodies should be transparent about why there are using these powers			1
‘ it is important that the public can have faith that surveillance powers are being used only in those situations where serious crimes are taking place and when there are no less intrusive alternative routes of investigation			2
’ a tv licensing spokesman said the @entity88 used @entity32 only to detect licence evaders ‘ as a last resort ’ , adding : ‘ the reason we do not release more details on how and when it is used is to ensure people without a valid tv licence do n’t use this information to their advantage			1
