when they took just one point from @entity5 and @entity6 in the space of a week , any title challenge from @entity2 ’s @entity1 was written off			1
their defence was porous , their midfield void of invention and their forwards misfiring			0
even @entity14 had fared better than the new @entity16 boss			0
a winter of discontent lay in store as november beckoned			0
but the forecast has changed at @entity20			1
@entity21 , thus far , has been a season of contentment for @entity24			0
the title race , having doubled in size when @entity5 stalled and @entity6 surged , now has a third competitor			1
@entity1 , after six wins on the spin , have hit top speed			1
@entity31 is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after opening the scoring against @entity34 @entity31 sent @entity34 goalkeeper @entity35 the wrong way to set up @entity1 's win over their chief rivals @entity2 has transformed @entity1 in the past six weeks , in which his side have won six times as it stands : the @entity43 table on monday the 3 - 0 victory over @entity34 was not without its flaws and they did , of course , need goalkeeper @entity48 at his best			1
but there was an air of inevitability about their triumph ; such expectancy is what has marked @entity1 as champions throughout the @entity43 era			1
they were quicker , stronger , more hungry and clinical			0
there was cunning , too , exemplified by the brilliant @entity60			1
@entity24 , it was said , was considering @entity60 for the captain ’s role before he was injured in the same week as the manager ’s unveiling			1
armband or not , he is leading their renaissance			0
@entity68 starts : six wins			2
his return has facilitated the realisation of this team ’s potential , of which there were early - season glimpses			1
now , it is there for all to see			0
@entity79 , having baffled all with his failure to produce despite the arrival of his mentor , now has four goals from four games			1
without his strikes two seasons back , sir @entity85 would not have signed off with a league winner ’s medal			0
likewise this time around - without an on - form and on - target @entity91 , they can not challenge			2
at @entity93 , where @entity1 were admittedly poor , the @entity16 striker had two chances and took them both			1
they won 2 - 1			2
while @entity91 has four in four , the captain has three in that period			0
having worn a frown for much of last season , he is playing with a smile , free of the pressure which had appeared to weigh so heavily amid the failings of his team - mates			2
@entity79 has scored four goals in his last four games to find his best form again at last the return of @entity60 ( left ) has provided experience and helped inspire @entity1 's recent resurgence @entity48 ( centre ) has been a rock in goal , almost single - handedly repelling @entity34 on sunday even the supporting cast are now playing their part ; @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 are all enjoying new direction under @entity24			1
20 dec @entity122 vs @entity1 26 dec @entity1 vs @entity123 28 dec @entity124 vs @entity1 1 jan @entity125 vs @entity1 4 @entity126 or @entity127 vs @entity1 ( @entity129 third round ) 11 jan @entity1 v @entity93 17 jan @entity132 v @entity1 31 jan @entity1 v @entity134 @entity119 , aided by @entity60 , is helping to shield a backline previously left brutally exposed			1
they have conceded just once at @entity20 in six hours and , in @entity138 , they finally boast a goalkeeper worthy of mention alongside the likes of @entity142 and @entity143			2
monday ’s @entity145 draw took place minus the previously ubiquitous @entity1			2
but that is no bad thing			0
even better , they managed to dodge the @entity150 and made an early exit from the @entity152			0
@entity5 , meanwhile , have a @entity152 quarter - final at @entity154 on wednesday , while @entity155 will serve as a distraction to domestic affairs when the knockout rounds resume with a tie against @entity160 in february			1
@entity6 , too , are not without their worries			2
@entity162 is sidelined until the new year , as is his replacement @entity164 and skipper @entity165			0
@entity167 lie in wait in the @entity145 and then there is @entity170 , match - winner again on saturday and a player they can ill afford to lose to the @entity174 , where he is contracted to play in 2015			0
@entity5 have seen their lead at the top of the @entity43 cut to just three points @entity6 must cope without star striker @entity162 until the new year due to injury @entity31 ( left ) , @entity91 and @entity118 celebrate the win that confirmed @entity1 among the title contenders video 6 wins in a row , my wife is happy - @entity24 before the new year , @entity1 face @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
they will be favourites to extend their winning run to nine matches , all the while quickening the pace in pursuit of the top two			0
it is all a far cry from the anonymity of their mid-table malaise just six weeks ago			0
@entity5 were as good as champions , @entity6 would take second and , as for @entity1 , they could do battle with @entity93 , @entity198 and @entity199 for the @entity150 places			1
they were 10th , residing only in the top half by virtue of goal difference over @entity204 and @entity123			0
they were closer to the bottom than the top			0
but @entity1 are motoring through the gears , the title race is on and there are three teams who can win it ... @entity213 here to like our @entity1 facebook page .			2

@entity1 beat @entity34 3 - 0 at @entity20 on sunday
@entity1 are now eight points behind @entity5 in the @entity43
@entity6 are just five points clear of @entity1
@entity2 has transformed his team in just six weeks , after six wins
@entity79 , @entity31 , @entity48 and @entity60 have been *key* men
