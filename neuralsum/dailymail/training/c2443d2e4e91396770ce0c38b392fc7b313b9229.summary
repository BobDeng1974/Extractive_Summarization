in a discovery that has shocked everyone involved , experts have found @entity3 can survive the harsh conditions of space as well as re-entry into the atmosphere			1
scientists who attached small double strands of @entity3 to the outer casing of a rocket said they were ' completely surprised ' when more than half the samples remained intact			1
this was despite temperatures soaring to more than 1,000 째 @entity15 ) during the short flight to sub-orbital space and back , and it raises the possibility of extraterrestrial life molecules arriving on @entity21 from space			1
scientists at the @entity23 have discovered that @entity3 can survive the harsh conditions of space and re-entry into the atmosphere			1
the finding was made by attaching @entity3 to the outer casing of a rocket , shown launching from the @entity29 base in @entity30 , @entity31			1
it has led to questions about the origin of life on @entity21 the research , published online in the journal @entity38 , was carried out by scientists from the @entity23 in @entity39			1
the @entity41 sub-orbital mission launched from the @entity43 base of @entity29 in @entity30 , northern @entity31 , and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket			0
but scientists decided , in addition , to test the effects space travel has on @entity3 when carried at three positions on the rocket 's outer casing - and found it survived			1
@entity56 is the theory that life exists throughout the universe and is spread by asteroids and comets , in addition to simply drifting through the cosmos			0
@entity56 proposes life forms that can survive the effects of space , such as extremophiles , become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life			0
these life - forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks			0
if met with ideal conditions on a new planet 's surface , the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins , it is believed			0
many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the @entity21 early in its history			2
but some go further and suggest that @entity3 , the essential molecule of life itself , could reach the @entity21 in meteoric dust , 100 tonnes of which hit the planet each day - a theory known as panspermia			1
during the experiment , around 53 per cent of the dna was recovered from the grooves in screw heads , and more than a third remained fully functional			0
the ' plasmid ' dna carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance			0
it was shown to function by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria , and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells			0
dr @entity109 , one of the scientists from the @entity23 , said : ' we were completely surprised to find so much intact and functionally active dna			1
' professor @entity113 , from the same university , added : ' this study provides experimental evidence that the dna 's genetic information is essentially capable of surviving the extreme conditions of space and the re-entry into @entity21 's dense atmosphere			2
' the @entity41 sub-orbital mission launched from the @entity122 ( shown on map ) and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket - but the surprising dna discovery is likely to spark considerable attention the type of dna carried by the rocket was known as ' plasmid dna ' ( stock image shown )			0
this carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance			0
it was shown to function on its return to @entity21 by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria , and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells the research also suggested that scientists conducting space missions to other planets needed to be careful about contamination			2
@entity151 said : ' the results show that it is by no means unlikely that , despite all the safety precautions , space ships could also carry terrestrial dna to their landing site			0
' we need to have this under control in the search for extraterrestrial life			0
' back in august , traces of plankton and other microorganisms were found living on the exterior of the @entity168 ( @entity168 ) by @entity170 cosmonauts			1
they claim the plankton were not carried there at launch - but are thought to have been blown there by air currents on @entity21			2
incredibly , the tiny organisms were found to be able to survive in the vacuum of space despite the freezing temperatures , lack of oxygen and cosmic radiation			2
some said the plankton may simply have been contamination from other areas of the @entity168 nonetheless , the discovery appeared to prove extremely primitive life could survive in the harsh environment of space			1
and , coupled with this latest research , the finding raises interesting questions about the origin of life on @entity21			2
many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the early @entity21			2
but , some go further and suggest @entity3 , the essential molecule of life itself , could reach the @entity21 in meteoric dust from elsewhere in the universe ( stock image shown ) - a theory known as panspermia back in august , traces of plankton and other microorganisms were found living on the exterior of the @entity168 ( @entity168 ) ( pictured ) by @entity170 cosmonauts			1
they claim the plankton were not carried there at launch - but are thought to have been blown there by air currents on @entity21			0

scientists at the @entity23 discover @entity3 can survive re-entry
the *remarkable* finding was made by attaching dna to a rocket
it was *subjected* to temperatures of more than 1,000 째 @entity224 ) at launch
but , when brought back to @entity21 , the dna was found to still function
' we were completely surprised , ' said dr @entity109 of the university
it supports the theory that life on @entity21 came from space
and it follows the discovery of plankton on the exterior of the @entity168 in august
