probably the most extraordinary thing about the island of @entity2 is that it was ever found at all			1
a tiny ten by six mile speck in the @entity5 1,200 miles from the coast of @entity7 , it lay undiscovered for around 14 million years able to evolve its own unique flora and fauna untouched by the outside world			1
but almost from the moment @entity16 explorer @entity14 was blown there by the @entity17 in 1502 it assumed an importance out of all proportion to its size			2
@entity21 is the capital of the @entity5 island of @entity2 , discovered by in 1502 by @entity23 it was a key stopping place for the ships of the @entity26 and other vessels - at its peak it serviced a thousand a year			1
it played a role in both slavery and its abolition : when the trade became illegal it was the base from which the @entity33 sought to capture the perpetrators and free their human cargo			2
and it was the place to which @entity36 was exiled after his defeat at @entity38			1
the emperor who had escaped @entity40 was not going to get away so easily from the most isolated place on earth			1
framed by cragged volcanic cliffs soaring 800 metres ( 2,600 feet ) above sea level , the island is just 122 square kilometres in total the island , which is smaller than central @entity48 has just 4,200 inhabitants - and 850 of them live in the small capital of @entity21 early next year a £ 218m airport will open and make this @entity52 no longer quite so isolated			1
at the moment though the only way to get there is still by sea and for most that means the @entity58			2
this @entity59 is the island ’s lifeline			1
it carries in all its supplies and up to 150 passengers who range from returning or departing @entity64 ( as the residents are known ) to tourists with a taste for something different as well as , more recently , construction workers , entrepreneurs and conservation experts			2
early next year , an airport will open on the island			1
the £ 218 million project will make this @entity52 far more accessible once the airport is open in february 2016 , the ship service - which takes five days from @entity76 - will be retired here , the runway of the future airport is visible			1
the upcoming airport will be located in the @entity82 area of the island this means it ’s a ship of two halves : the front laden with dozens of huge containers , the back a sun deck where we take dips in the little swimming pool and play quoits , shuffleboard , skittles and passengers v. crew cricket			1
in between are a couple of lounges with bars where travellers can listen to talks and watch films			2
these are not compulsory , of course , and many of the @entity64 for whom the voyage is basically just a bus service sit and watch benignly			2
for the rest of us they ’re a wonderful ice - breaker and a source of great fun and fierce rivalry : passions are running particularly high by the final of the three night accumulator quiz			2
as it stands , the only way to reach @entity2 is via ship - the @entity58 , a @entity59 that transports all supplies to the island traveller @entity124 describes the ship as a ' ship of two halves ' : the front laden with dozens of huge containers , with a sundeck out back we are fortified in all this by the most enormous hearty meals : there ’s even an extra savoury course after the cheese at dinner though i never get that far myself			1
sailing on the @entity58 has been like stepping back in time			0
captain @entity135 himself tells me that sometimes he surveys the deck and thinks this is still a bit of @entity139 on which the sun has not yet set			0
for me at times though it seems even further back and i think a lot about all those ancient mariners crossing this vast ocean where in a ten - day round trip we sight only two other ships and even the wandering albatrosses say goodbye after a couple of days			0
it ’s good preparation for the island itself which emerges from the waves at dawn like a dream			2
there is in fact something rather @entity161 - ish about @entity2 as if everything has shrunken to produce a geography and a society in miniature			1
the edge of the runway will offer spectacular views of the blue water , nestled among the jagged rocks of the coastline while visiting , @entity124 climbed the island 's infamous @entity172 : a 699 - step staircase that towers 600 feet in the air so within only 47 square miles of land mass there are barren deserts and lush cloud forests , a black sand beach and towering crags , rolling pastureland and peaks of up to 2,700 feet			1
on a central ridge it ’s possible to look in one direction on the empty moonscape of @entity188 and in another on sheep scattered fields which could be in @entity192			0
similarly in human terms for a population of 4,000 , barely the size of an @entity198 village , there is a governor , a legislative council , a hospital , three primary and one secondary school , a cathedral with a bishop plus places of worship for several different denominations , a police force , a prison , two newspapers and two radio stations			0
what this means for the visitor is a wide range of activities			0
i seemed to fill almost every hour of the nine days i spent there while the ship sailed on to @entity220 and back			0
despite being barely the size of an @entity198 village , the capital boasts a legislative council , several schools and two newspapers two were spent walking : there are lots of trails graded in difficulty and many routes have ‘ post boxes ’ which hold visitors books and rubber stamps			0
one day we climbed @entity235 in the company of @entity237 , a mine - of - information @entity198 known locally as @entity239 who is on a three year project to catalogue the local invertebrates			2
on another we walked with a young @entity242 to @entity243 , @entity244 and his wife being giant geological features and the pool being a serene inlet protected by rocks from the crashing waves beyond and filled with colourful fish			0
the walk was an hour ’s climb up a steep rocky hillside and half an hour ’s descent down the other side ending in having to slither down a rope for the last 30 feet but more than worth it			0
it was one of the loveliest places where i have ever swum			0
@entity263 life is a big attractions for snorkelers and divers – there are also several wrecks to explore – and fishermen who can chase tuna , wahoo and marlin			0
we were too late for the seasonal visit of whale sharks but 200 dolphins did their best to compensate , cavorting around our boat as we sailed out to the seabird colonies			0
i also had an enchanting afternoon watching wirebirds , the island ’s only endemic bird so called because of its spindly legs and something of a conservation success story			2
the island is full of trails - of varying levels of difficulty - as well as fabulous swimming and diving opportunities as well as there being several ship wrecks to explore , the marine life is another major draw for snorkellers and divers alike by contrast there was a @entity36 themed day : a visit to @entity299 where he stayed briefly when he first arrived , @entity300 where he lived for six years until his death in 1821 and his tomb in the pretty valley setting he chose himself			1
though his body was repatriated to @entity306 19 years later and much of @entity308 ’s contents like the clothes and the death masks are replicas , the places are still resonant if melancholy			0
and it ’s not every day one can stand on the exact spot where an emperor passed away			0
. other experiences included a cookery lesson making tuna fishcakes , pumpkin stew and pilau – pronounced plo – a spicy legacy of @entity2 ’s diversity , which its people made up from arrivals from @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity33 and @entity7			1
there were also visits to the ‘ world ’s remotest distillery ’ run by ex-pat @entity332 @entity331 who produces among other drinks a spirit called tungi made from prickly pear and ’ the world ’s remotest coffee plantation ’ run by another ex-pat @entity339 who decided to revive the @entity341 bushes originally brought over from @entity342 in 1732			0
@entity2 is also home to the ' world 's most remote distillery ' and the ' world 's remotest coffee plantation , ' both run by @entity33 ex-pats then there was the small but excellent museum , the forts , batteries and cannons dotted around the place , the fine collection of @entity2 prints and drawings at @entity362 ( in pre-photography days ships had their own artists on board ) , the @entity350 cemetery ( 6,000 were imprisoned here during the @entity352 but given freedom to work , trade and organise events ) and the @entity357 grounds to see @entity372 the tortoise who is at least 182 years old and probably the world ’s oldest reptile			1
and finally i did what any self - respecting visitor has to do and climbed @entity172			0
once a tramway for hauling goods up the cliff side in the capital jamestown this is now a terrifyingly steep 600 ft high staircase of 699 steps			0
not wanting to risk passing out halfway up , i took it very slowly , pausing every 50 steps and reaching the top in 28 minutes			0
i was pretty puffed up with pride but quickly deflated when i learned the record stands at 5 minutes 11 seconds			0
@entity391 ( 01737 214 291 ; www.discover-the-world.co.uk ) offers a 20 - night self - drive holiday to @entity2 from now until march 2016 priced from £ 3,451pp ( two sharing ) including 10 nights on the ship , two nights in @entity76 and 8 nights bed & breakfast on the island			1
for more information about @entity2 , visit www.sthelenatourism.com			1
currently , the only way to reach the island is aboard the @entity58 , learn more at www.rms-st-helena.com .			1

@entity2 , a 122 square kilometre island in the middle of the @entity5 , will soon be much easier to reach
early next year , the island 's £ 218 million airport will be complete , opening it up to tourists like never before
the remote *destination* is perhaps best known as the place where @entity36 was exiled after his @entity38 defeat
