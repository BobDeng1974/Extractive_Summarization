proposals : @entity1 wants to impose a benefits cap of £ 26,000 , which is the same figure as the income of an average family scores of workless families with ten or more children are living on state benefits worth more than £ 60,000 a year			1
figures released under the @entity10 show that there are 190 families with at least ten under - 18s where one or both of the parents gets an out - of - work benefit			1
these families are eligible for £ 61,183 a year in state support – much more than they could hope to earn if they entered the job market			1
a family in work would have to earn £ 93,000 to be left with this amount of money after tax			2
the statistics illustrate the extent to which enormous handouts condemn such families to a life on benefits , because it would not be worth their while to take on work			1
one minister has suggested that parents should think twice about having so many children if they can not support them without the help of benefits			2
nearly 100,000 people on benefits have four or more children , with more than 900 claimants having at least eight			2
work and pensions secretary @entity1 wants to impose a benefits cap of £ 26,000 – the income of an average family – on workless families			1
sources say the cap is essential to stop workshy families using extra children as revenue - raisers , getting more child benefit and perhaps a larger house			1
but the plan is hitting trouble in the @entity55 , with some @entity56 arguing that the cap should be set higher			2
the @entity58 are determined the original cap should go through to help bring the costs of the welfare state under control			2
a crucial vote will be held next week			0
last night mr @entity1 said : ‘ @entity64 left our welfare system in a sorry state , with too many people better off out of work and on benefits than if they entered the working world			1
@entity72 and @entity73 receive £ 95,000 a year in state benefits to look after their ten children aged one to 15			1
they live in a four - bedroom house rent - free and the council even pays for breakfast to be delivered			0
the @entity81 were evicted from their previous home in @entity83 , leaving it uninhabitable , according to their former landlord who claimed that mattresses and walls were stained with human and animal excrement			0
but despite being given a new home by the council in @entity92 , mrs @entity93 , 36 , complained : ‘ it ’s very cramped			0
we have four bedrooms with bunk beds for the kids and that ’s it			0
we ’ve been told we might not be given a new house for another nine months , which is ridiculous			0
’ complaining : @entity72 and @entity73 received £ 95,000 in benefits , live in a four - bedroom house rent free and even have breakfast delivered , but they are still not happy with what they have she claimed they were so short of money that the children had only one @entity112 games console between them			1
she said in september 2010 : ‘ we do get breakfast delivered but sometimes we have to ring them to remind them and it ’s not like proper hot food			0
‘ it ’s usually beans , tinned tomatoes and cereal , which is n’t really enough for us all			0
’ the couple have not worked since mr @entity1 , 40 , resigned from the @entity125 in 2001 to care for his wife , who has curvature of the spine			1
at that time they had three children			0
the family receive child benefits , disability living allowance , carer ’s allowance , tax credits and income support totalling £ 44,954 a year			1
they also have a £ 950 - a - week bed - and - breakfast deal where the council pays for breakfasts delivered to their home			2
this comes to £ 49,400 , making a grand total of £ 94,354 a year			0
‘ it ’s not fair that benefit claimants can receive higher incomes than families who are in work , in some cases more than double the average household income			1
that ’s why we ’re introducing a cap on benefits – to restore fairness to our welfare system while ensuring that support goes to those who need it			1
’ figures released following an @entity163 request show that there are 140 families with ten children in @entity167 receiving an out - of - work benefit			1
another 30 have 11 children , and 20 families have 12 , making a total of 190 with ten children or more			0
pleased : @entity173 of the @entity174 said that it was only right that the government is taking action these families get a range of benefits including jobseekers ’ allowance , incapacity benefit , income support and employment and support allowance			1
they are also entitled to other handouts , including housing benefit , child tax credits , child benefit and council tax benefit			1
a workless family with ten children under the age of 18 could receive around £ 1,177 a week in benefits if they were claiming all these			2
that works out at £ 61,183 a year , a total of more than £ 11million for all the families involved			2
ministers believe the vast majority of the families will be claiming all the benefits to which they are entitled			2
@entity173 , of the @entity203 ’ @entity174 , said : ‘ taxpayers feel that it is unfair that so many claimants are receiving so much more in benefits that many hard - working people			0
‘ this has to change and it ’s right that the government is taking action			0
’ it was reported last week that the government is planning last - minute changes to the controversial cap on benefits for workless families in an attempt to quell a rebellion among @entity56 peers			1
the £ 26,000 figure is based on average income for all families , including those on benefits , which means it is lower than the income of a family in work			1
some @entity56 argue that the cap should be set higher , to the level of the average income of a family in work			0
just over a year ago , culture secretary @entity236 provoked a storm by saying it should not be the state ’s responsibility to fund the ever - growing families of the workshy			0
he said : ‘ the number of children that you have is a choice and what we ’re saying is that if people are living on benefits , then they make choices but they also have to have responsibility for those choices			0
‘ it ’s not going to be the role of the state to finance those choices			0
‘ you can have children but if you are going to ask for support that is more than the average wage that people earn , then we ’re saying no , the state should n’t support that			0
‘ that ’s not fair on working people who have to pay the taxes to pay those benefits			0

statistic show extent to which handouts condemn families to life on benefits
