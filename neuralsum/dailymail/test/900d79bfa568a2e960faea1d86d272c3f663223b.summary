a vietnam war veteran has been suffering from songs being stuck in his head for weeks at a time in a condition that doctors think may be linked to his service			1
@entity7 , 68 , of @entity8 , @entity8 , first sought medical attention after he got @entity10 trapped inside his mind last may , setting off nearly twelve months of doctors his mind shuffling between tunes that are stuck on repeat			1
he has also hallucinated the theme song to the western 1950s television show @entity18 had the same mysterious bugle call stuck in his head for years			1
@entity22 neurologist dr @entity21 and researcher @entity23 have looked for a way to end the earworm , though they have yet to find a cure for the military - style revelry			0
sounds including police sirens are stuck in his head for around a month ' these men and women who served , their service still influences their lives even years later , ' dr @entity21 told @entity39			1
the doctor said that the hallucinations occur in those in hearing loss , when the brain compensates for a lack of stimulation by making its own sounds			0
@entity23 , who used to make drum machines and synthesizers for @entity50 and @entity51 before he got into science , said that music hallucinations are different from how a normal person has a song stuck in their head			2
he told @entity58 that patients such as @entity7 experience their hallucinations as sound , rather than have the consciousness that it is only stuck in their head			2
@entity7 will often be listening to the same song for a month before something new appears , though some , like the bugle call , never leave			1
he thinks that his mind made up the sound , which no one else can put a name to , though he likes it better than other sounds such as the police sirens that circled around his brain for a week			2
@entity23 , a cognitive science researcher who used to make synthesizers for @entity51 , helped @entity7 identify the song in his head and says the tune is unique because it is self - composed dr @entity21 ( left ) of the @entity22 ( right ) is trying to help cure @entity7 by playing the song repeatedly in hopes that he will tune it out @entity23 said that music hallucinations are most often songs that everyone else knows such as ' @entity10 ' , making @entity7 's self - composed song fairly novel			1
the call was particularly frustrating when he first brought it to the attention of doctors , as he did not know what it was			0
he originally described it as some sort of brass instrument , and was only able to narrow it down with @entity23 's knowledge of synthesizers and knack for creating sounds described by others such as musical artists			0
' i 'm getting used to it , but i do n't like it , ' @entity7 said of the condition			0
dr @entity21 is trying to help him rid himself of the current bugle call by playing the song repeatedly in hopes that his patient will tune it out			2
musical hallucinations are most common in older people and often bring back melodies heard during youth			0
@entity7 's father was a jazz saxophonist , according to @entity117 .			0
