by @entity0 a @entity2 university has staged a bizarre quilt - folding contest to work out which students were neat and tidy enough to get one of the rooms in a student dorm			1
a shortage means there is tough competition to get official accommodation at @entity12 in @entity13 in eastern @entity2 , so staff decided the unusual test was the best way to root out slovenly students			1
in scenes difficult to imagine at a @entity21 university , about 200 students were given 20 minutes to fold the quilts and prove they were neat and tidy enough to win one of the coveted places			1
neat idea : @entity2 students had to undertake a quilt - folding contest to prove they were tidy enough to win a place in a dorm coveted : official accommodation is scarce , so competition for a spot is fierce a university spokesman said : ' some students do n't pay attention to hygiene and the dorm ended up a mess , so we have tried to clamp down a bit on standards and this is a good way to focus on the priorities , to encourage the students to treat their dorm with more respect			1
' a tidy home is not just a better place to live - but also a better place to study			0
besides , the contest is interesting and makes the campus life more colourful			2
' students in @entity2 are known for the extreme lengths they are willing to go to			2
time trial : about 200 students were given 20 minutes to fold the quilts dedication : @entity2 students will go to extreme lengths to excel at university moment of truth : the quilts are laid out for inspection by university staff young scholars are so keen to learn they have been spotted breaking into their university lecture rooms at night to guarantee themselves a seat during the next day 's lessons			0
@entity2 citizens were bemused earlier this year when the @entity2 military released pictures of 500 army recruits taking part in a quilt - folding contest in @entity75 , capital of eastern @entity2 's @entity76			0
the recruits were tasked with folding the quilt as precisely and neatly as possible			0
the populace took to the internet and joked that @entity2 's military superiority was assured as its soldiers excel in the art of neatly folding their bedding .			0
