by @entity1 reporter published : 20:44 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 04:46 est , 23 may 2013 a baby boy , who doctors said would probably never leave hospital alive , has had his life - threatening condition cured by a medical first achieved using plastic particles and a 3d laser printer			1
@entity9 , who used to stop breathing nearly every day , can now breathe normally after having a windpipe transplant and an artificial airway splint inserted			1
it 's the latest advance from the booming field of regenerative medicine , making body parts in the lab. healthy future : @entity9 plays with the family 's dog , bandit , outside his @entity22 , @entity21 home on tuesday in the case of @entity9 , doctors did n't have a moment to spare			1
because of a birth defect , the little @entity21 boy 's airway kept collapsing , causing his breathing to stop and often his heart , too			1
doctors in @entity32 had been researching artificial airway splints but had never implanted one in a patient			1
in a single day , they ‘ printed out ’ 100 tiny tubes , using computer - guided lasers to stack and fuse thin layers of plastic instead of paper and ink to form various shapes and sizes			2
the next day , with special permission from the @entity46 , they implanted one of these tubes in @entity49 , the first time it had been done			0
suddenly , a baby that doctors had said would probably not leave the hospital alive could breathe normally for the first time			1
he was three months old when the operation was done last year and is nearly 19 months old now			0
@entity9 , playing with his mom april , can finally breathe normally thanks to a first - of - a - kind biodegradable airway made by @entity32 doctors using plastic particles and a @entity61 laser printer he is about to have his tracheotomy tube removed ; it was placed when he was a couple months old and needed a breathing machine			1
he has not had a single breathing crisis since going home a year ago			0
‘ he 's a pretty healthy kid right now , ’ said dr. @entity67 , a pediatric ear , nose and throat specialist at @entity71 of the @entity72 in @entity73 , where the operation was done			2
it 's described in thursday 's @entity76			0
independent experts praised the work and the potential for 3 - d printing to create more body parts to solve unmet medical needs			2
‘ it 's the wave of the future , ’ said dr. @entity83 , a pediatric specialist at the @entity84 in @entity85			0
‘ i 'm impressed by what they were able to accomplish			0
’ so far , only a few adults have had trachea , or windpipe transplants , usually to replace ones destroyed by cancer			0
the windpipes came from dead donors or were lab - made , sometimes using stem cells			0
in a medical first , doctors at the @entity99 used plastic particles and a @entity61 laser printer to create an airway splint to save @entity9 's life last month , a 2 - year - old girl born without a windpipe received one grown from her own stem cells onto a plastic scaffold at a hospital in @entity111 , @entity112 @entity9 had a different problem - an incompletely formed bronchus , one of the two airways that branch off the windpipe like pant legs to the lungs			1
about 2,000 babies are born with such defects each year in the @entity122 and most outgrow them by age 2 or 3 , as more tissue develops			2
in severe cases , parents learn of the defect when the child suddenly stops breathing and dies			1
that almost happened when @entity9 was six weeks old at a restaurant with his parents , april and @entity134 , who live in @entity22 , in northeast @entity21			1
‘ he turned blue and stopped breathing on us , ’ and his father did cpr to revive him , @entity135 said			0
the splint has a slit along its length so it can expand and grow as the child does - something a permanent , artificial implant could not do more episodes followed , and @entity9 had to go on a breathing machine when he was two months old			1
doctors told the couple his condition was grave			1
‘ quite a few of them said he had a good chance of not leaving the hospital alive			1
it was pretty scary , ’ his mother said			0
‘ we pretty much prayed every night , hoping that he would pull through			0
’ then a doctor at @entity160 , @entity161 , suggested the experimental work in @entity32			0
researchers there were testing airway splints made from biodegradable polyester that is sometimes used to repair bone and cartilage			2
@entity9 had the operation on feb. 9 , 2012			2
the splint was placed around his defective bronchus , which was stitched to the splint to keep it from collapsing			2
the splint has a slit along its length so it can expand and grow as the child does - something a permanent , artificial implant could not do			2
normal kid : @entity9 has n't had a single breathing crisis since leaving hospital a year ago and is about to have his tracheotomy tube removed the plastic is designed to degrade and gradually be absorbed by the body over three years , as healthy tissue forms to replace it , said the biomedical engineer who led the work , @entity188			1
@entity67 and @entity188 have a patent pending on the device and @entity188 has a financial interest in a company that makes scaffolds for implants			0
dr. @entity196 , a pediatric specialist at @entity198 's @entity197 , said only time will tell if this proves to be a permanent solution , but he praised the researchers for persevering to develop it			0
‘ i can think of a handful of children i have seen in the last two decades who suffered greatly ... that likely would have benefited from this technology , ’ @entity196 said .			0

@entity9 was born with a defect that caused his airway to keep collapsing
doctors told his parents he would probably never leave hospital alive
in a medical first , a 3d printer created an artificial airway splint which was inserted into his throat
now he can breath normally and is about to have his tracheotomy tube removed
