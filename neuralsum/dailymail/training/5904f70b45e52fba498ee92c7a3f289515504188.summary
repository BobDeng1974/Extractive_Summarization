@entity5 , 47 , had been heading to a building site in the city of @entity8 in western @entity10 's @entity9 when he suddenly came to an abrupt stop after the ground collapsed underneath him			1
he said : ' i was travelling pretty fast when suddenly i felt the truck bump as if it had hit something and come to a stop , which sent me flying forward			2
i had absolutely no idea what had happened but then it started lifting in the air and suddenly i was looking at the sky			0
i opened the door and jumped out as quickly as possible and realised that almost the entire lorry had vanished into a hole in the ground			2
he said : ' it was a shame , i reckon the load would have gone some way towards filling the hole although it was pretty big			0
' @entity48 spokesman @entity47 said : ' the truck which was a " @entity50 " cement mixer vanished into a hole in the ground at the point with the road runs alongside the river outside the @entity57 shopping centre			1
the road had only just been repaired so it 's a mystery as to how this happened			0

in total it was in the ground for almost two days			0
@entity47 said : ' we could n't risk putting up a crane until we had tested the rest of the ground to make sure there were n't any other surprises			0
