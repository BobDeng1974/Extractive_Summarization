@entity0 has submitted a formal proposal for a summer blockbuster between @entity3 and @entity4			1
significant hurdles remain in making a june bout between these super-bantamweight world champions , most notably because they are backed by different broadcasters , with @entity3 enjoying huge exposure on @entity10 while @entity0 's fighters , including @entity12 ( regular ) champion @entity4 , operate on @entity14			1
the dilemma is between the lure of terrestrial television and the greater prize purses that would most likely be generated by a box office event on @entity14			0
for his part , @entity0 has now tabled a proposal and is waiting on a reciprocal suggestion from @entity23 , who manages @entity24 champion @entity3			2
@entity3 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) could be in line for a super-bantamweight bout in june @entity0 has tabled a proposal for the fight but significant hurdles still remain @entity3 's manager @entity23 will talk with his boxer as a decision draws near it remains to be seen if there will be a way forward from there , with @entity23 adamant after @entity3 's excellent win over @entity36 last month that the fight should prioritise exposure over ' greed '			1
but @entity0 told @entity40 : ' @entity4 is not worried about where the fight is staged or what television channel it is shown on – we just want to make this fight			1
of course the finances have to be right and we have submitted a proposal that will pay both fighters huge money			0
they ( @entity3 and @entity23 ) will talk with their broadcaster and see what 's on offer and then hopefully we will sit down as soon as possible			0
' after that , we can push negotiations on			0
i 'm not sure if we will ever find an agreed split - i would be happy for a 60 - 40 purse split in favour of the winner			0
if you really fancy it i ca n't see a problem with that			0
@entity3 celebrates after his victory over @entity36 in @entity68 , @entity69 in february @entity3 spins to address the crowd after stopping @entity36 in the fifth round last month ' we can talk about world titles and legacy and exposure but ultimately this is a super fight – and in a super fight it is only right that these two great fighters get the best deal possible financially			1
' venues for what would likely be the biggest fight in @entity83 this year are currently under consideration in @entity68 , where @entity3 is from , as well as @entity85 and the @entity86 in @entity87			2
@entity0 added : ' if we can all reach an agreement , then i would love to make this fight in june			2
we 'd be happy to fight in @entity68 if the numbers were right , but likewise @entity85 would be brilliant and so would the @entity86 in @entity87			0
there is a long way to go but who would n't want to see this fight ? ' after @entity3 's thrilling @entity10 debut against @entity98 on february 28 , in which he extended his record to 20 wins from 20 fights , @entity23 said : ' @entity0 thinks of the numbers all the time , let 's think of the game , let 's think of it being free - to - air and millions and millions of people enjoying watching it because it will be a great fight			1
