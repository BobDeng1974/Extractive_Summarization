it ’s been a busy old month for @entity1			0
from playing a pivotal role for @entity3 as they won @entity5 for the first time in nearly two decades , and then finished runners - up in the @entity8 to @entity9 , to trying to decide where his club future lies			2
@entity13 is beckoning for him to return to his parent club @entity14 ahead of next season , but first there is the small matter of a @entity20 campaign with @entity21			1
his clean sheet in @entity21 's 1 - 0 win against @entity24 was the 100th of his career – a remarkable achievement when you consider he has only just turned 22			2
milestone : @entity1 makes a strong stop in the first half of @entity21 's @entity20 win against @entity24 safe hands : the @entity33 commands his area well to punch a corner clear against @entity37 's men the flamboyant @entity38 might be the standout 24 - carat piece in @entity21 ’s ‘ golden generation ’ , but @entity1 is arguably just as valuable			2
the 6ft 6in shotstopper has reached the milestone in 218 games for club and country , meaning he has kept clean sheets in 45.87 % of the games he has played in since making his debut for @entity52 in the @entity53 in 2009			1
safe hands : @entity1 , pictured with @entity55 and @entity56 , before the @entity24 match in comparison , @entity58 , considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time ( regardless of his recent blip in form ) , had kept 73 clean sheets when he turned 22 in the summer of 2003			1
benchmark : @entity58 in training ahead of @entity66 's final @entity20 group stage match against @entity67 @entity21 have still never lost when @entity1 has been in the side			1
that ’s 19 games now			0
thirteen wins , six draws and zero defeats			0
not bad for a 22 - year - old			0
early stages : @entity1 shouting during a game for his first club @entity52 in the @entity53 @entity77 rivals : @entity1 shakes the hand of a winking @entity79 after a match against @entity9 upsetting the parents : stealing the ball from @entity14 striker @entity83 in @entity3 's @entity8 win			0

the goalkeeper has 100 clean sheets in 218 games for club and country
the @entity21 *international* has already won the @entity93 and @entity5
he is *expected* to return to parent club @entity14 after the @entity20
at the same point in his career @entity58 had only kept 73 clean sheets
