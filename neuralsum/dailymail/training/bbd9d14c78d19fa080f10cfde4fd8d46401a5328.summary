@entity2 chairman @entity1 ’s next stated ambition after his @entity3 is to restructure the management of the @entity2			2
that does n’t look like good news for the @entity8 set - up established by sir @entity9 in 2010 to run international football for the @entity2			1
two members of the @entity8 board , sir @entity13 and general secretary @entity14 , have left or are leaving the @entity2			1
that gives dyke the opening to disband the group and hand the responsibility of running @entity8 business to @entity20 , technical director designate , and performance services chief @entity21			1
they both impressed the main @entity2 board with a presentation about the way forward for @entity8 after the @entity27 debacle			1
a perplexed @entity28 ca n’t help identify who is responsible for posting an advertisement in @entity31 offering a full - time professional football club for sale that owns the stadium and is situated in a ‘ fast expanding city in @entity8 ’			1
however , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 fit that description			2
@entity2 chairman @entity1 is planning to reshape the @entity8 board in the foreseeable future @entity20 , pictured with national team boss @entity42 , will help @entity8 's future progression sir @entity13 left his role on the @entity8 board after the @entity45 while @entity14 ( right ) will leave his position in january 2015 whoever wins the race to host the @entity49 can thank the @entity50 for bringing about the bid reform recommendations that were influential to the changes being rubber stamped in december			1
@entity54 combined with @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 in formulating a document of proposals for future bids sent to @entity62 president @entity61			2
and @entity54 , who withdrew from bidding for the 2022 @entity64 , said they would have re-engaged in the process if the new regulations had come in earlier			0
one wonders why @entity69 sports tycoon @entity68 , owner of ice hockey ’s @entity70 and basketball ’s @entity72 , turned up at the recent leaders in @entity76 conference when he was already well down the road in his @entity79 takeover and then denied any interest in acquiring a @entity82 club			1
@entity69 investor @entity68 is in talks with @entity79 about purchasing the @entity82 club a @entity86 and bull story @entity88 executive @entity86 made an extraordinary claim that temporary buildings are the only real cost of staging a @entity27 and that @entity88 spent three times more than @entity93 on the 2014 tournament			1
@entity88 ’s corporate communications manager told the @entity97 summit that $ 600m — the cost of temporary structures — was the real @entity93 bill , while the governing body had forked out $ 1.7billion			0
@entity88 ’s spending for @entity103 2018 is estimated at $ 2.1bn			0
@entity86 said : ‘ there is a complete misunderstanding of what are the costs of staging a @entity27			0
in @entity93 every metro or bus line was put under the cost to get this number of $ 31bn			0
but what does this have to do with the @entity27 ? we do n’t need a new bus line or changing a favela			0
the temporary infrastructure , yes , that ’s the only cost			0
’ @entity86 also added that @entity57 and @entity118 had a vision of why they wanted a @entity27 but @entity88 were ‘ still wondering ’ what @entity93 ’s was — apart from winning it			0
whatever @entity86 ’s left - field views , @entity88 still made a profit of $ 2.7bn from the @entity93 tournament .			2

@entity20 will have more responsibility on the @entity128 set up
sir @entity13 left after the @entity45 while @entity14 will leave in january 2015
a football team in ' a fast expanding city in @entity8 ' posted an advertisement in the @entity31 stating a football team is for sale
@entity137 , who is interested in purchasing @entity79 , attended the recent leaders in @entity76 conference
