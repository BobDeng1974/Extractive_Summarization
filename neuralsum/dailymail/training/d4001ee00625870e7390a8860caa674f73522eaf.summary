by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:54 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:26 est , 31 december 2013 a four - year - old boy who was too young for life - saving heart surgery was kept alive by a rubber band until he was ready for the operation			1
@entity7 , who was born with a hole in his heart , finally underwent the surgery earlier this year - and when he came round from anaesthetic , the cheeky boy 's first words to his family were ' boobies and knickers '			1
his family has now paid tribute to the pioneering device which saved his life by reducing the size of an artery and helping him breathe properly			0
miracle : @entity7 was kept alive for four years by a rubber band in his pulmonary artery when @entity7 was just a few months old and struggling to put on weight , doctors discovered that he was suffering from a hole in his heart as well as an enlarged artery which affected his breathing by putting pressure on his lungs			1
they believed he was too small for the surgery he would need to correct the faults , so they fitted a rubber band around the artery to reduce its size			1
the band could be easily adjusted by pointing a remote control at the boy 's chest , meaning that its size changed as @entity7 grew older , avoiding the need for it to be manually adjusted			1
it was finally removed by doctors during a 12 - hour operation in october at @entity47 's @entity48 intended to repair his heart			1
relief : @entity7 , pictured with brother @entity51 and parents @entity53 and @entity54 , has finally undergone the heart surgery the @entity56 was invented by children 's heart surgeon @entity59 of @entity48 in @entity47 as a way of helping children who need heart surgery but are too young			1
pulmonary artery banding - essentially a rubber band wrapped round the artery to reduce its size - has long been used to control serious heart conditions in children waiting for operations			1
however , as the children grow older they often need the exact size of the band to be adjusted several times , which has previously required surgery			2
the @entity56 is controlled by a remote device which sends a radio signal instantly changing the size of the band without the need for further surgical @entity81 size is changed by a tiny motor and piston clipped to the band , which can either tighten or loosen the device as necessary			0
his mother @entity54 , from @entity88 in @entity89 , said : ' they wanted to wait until @entity7 was bigger so his heart would be bigger , making it a less risky procedure			2
' your heart is the size of your fist , and @entity7 had tiny fists so the operation would have been very intricate			1
' before this invention , @entity7 would have had to have surgery each time the band needed to be expanded , and he would have faced at least four or five operations by now			2
' but instead , it took about 30 seconds to adjust the @entity56 with the remote control			0
they just put the remote control on @entity7 's chest to expand the band			1
' when the boy 's parents first noticed that something was wrong , doctors sent him to @entity48 where specialists discovered the hole in his heart			2
in addition , @entity7 's pulmonary artery was 3cm wide instead of 1cm , putting too much pressure on his heart and lungs			2
at home : @entity7 is now recovering at his home in @entity89 alongside six - year - old brother jack mrs @entity125 said : ' doctors had warned us that there was a 15 per cent chance that @entity7 would not make it through the surgery			0
' the surgeon told us that for difficulty , he rated @entity7 's surgery as 9.5 out of 10			0
' he was in theatre for eight and a half hours , but then had to be rushed back for another three and a half hours after doctors realised he was suffering from internal bleeding			0
' @entity7 is a cheeky little character and he loves making people laugh and telling jokes - particularly rude ones ! ' , his mother said			0
' the nurse just fell about laughing when he came out with his first words			0
' after a week in hospital , @entity7 is now recovering at home with his six - year - old brother @entity51 , and is healthier than ever before			0
mrs @entity125 added : ' it has been a real rollercoaster for the whole family and we are thrilled that the heart surgery has been done , as that is all we have been gearing up to for the last few years			0

@entity7 was born with an enlarged artery and a hole in his heart
but doctors said it was too dangerous to operate until he was older
he had an adjustable rubber band fitted to control the size of the artery
finally underwent operation in october and came out with cheeky comment as soon as he woke up again
