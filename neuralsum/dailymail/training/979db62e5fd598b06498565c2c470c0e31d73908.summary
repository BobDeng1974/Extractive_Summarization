@entity17 's skin is so sensitive that it can tear if she is even picked up , her feet are permanently wrapped up in bandages , and she has to be given morphine before she can even be bathed			1
mother @entity22 and father @entity23 ( pictured ) are scared to cuddle their baby because of the rare condition she suffers with			1
five - month - old @entity27 has @entity15 which causes her skin to blister the child must be dressed with her clothes turned inside - out to avoid the seams rubbing against her skin , and all labels must be cut out of anything she wears			1
@entity17 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , has such a severe form of the disorder that she not only gets sores and blisters on her skin , her mouth , throat and eyes are also affected			1
mother @entity22 , 34 , said : ' when we first discovered what @entity17 's condition was , we were scared to pick her up at all , and that caused a lot of difficulty with bonding			2
' i was afraid to touch her in case i hurt her but i wanted to give her a cuddle and make sure she was comfortable			0
at first doctors thought @entity17 had been born with birthmarks on her feet or that the redness could be sign of infection			2
it was n't until they saw blisters on her back that they suspected she had something more serious ' we have to be careful what we wear when we do pick her up and all jewellery or anything that could scratch her skin has to come straight off			2
we ca n't be too careful			0
' @entity17 's daily routine means her parents @entity22 and @entity76 , 47 , have to pop her blisters , apply cream to them and dress her in soft clothing and nappies			0
but when she was born , @entity17 had no skin on her feet at all , but doctors were baffled as to what could be wrong with her			1
doctors thought @entity17 might be suffering from early chickenpox			0
it looked like chicken pox			0
eventually they confirmed she has the incredibly rare skin condition @entity15 ' at first they thought they were birthmarks on her feet , and then they thought it could be an infection , ' @entity22 said			1
' they were n't really sure and doctors were at a loss			0
' but then they changed her nappy and we saw she had started to blister on her back and her bottom			2
it looked like chicken pox			0
' finally they confirmed she had @entity0 , but still no - one was too sure as to how to treat her			1
' @entity15 is a severe genetic skin disorder that affects around 5,000 sufferers in the @entity3 , and only 500,000 worldwide			1
the condition causes blisters to develop anywhere on the skin , and the mouth and eyes are particularly susceptible to the sores			1
@entity117 exacerbates the condition skin is made up of two layers ; the outer layer is the epidermis and the inner layer is the dermis			1
in healthy skin , proteins hold the two layers together so they do not move separately			2
in those born with @entity0 , the layers do not have the protein that holds them together			1
it means that any movement that creates friction between the two layers creates blisters			0
blisters can develop anywhere on the skin , and the mouth and eyes are particularly susceptible to the sores			2
@entity17 's feet are permanently bandaged , her clothes must be inside - out to prevent seams rubbing against her and she must be given morphine before being bathed some sufferers are born with blisters but others will develop them in the first few weeks of their life			1
@entity17 was diagnosed with @entity0 , which means she also has an exceptionally high risk of developing skin cancer as a teenager			1
@entity22 , a teaching assistant , said : ' her skin is incredibly sensitive			2
i pulled her little vest off the other day and felt skin come away from underneath her arm			2
' it 's terrifying because it feels like i 'm hurting her			0
we have to be so careful			0
' she rolled over recently , and while it was exciting to see to begin with , we then thought about how much more damage she could do just by being a normal baby			0
@entity17 was diagnosed with @entity0 , which means she also has an exceptionally high risk of developing skin cancer as a teenager ' she will struggle with crawling and it 's often hard to find the right shoes for @entity0 babies because of the pain in their feet			1
' @entity17 is in so much constant pain that she is permanently dosed up on the maximum amounts of paracetamol and ibuprofen , and when she has her dressings changed , she has to be given morphine			1
@entity22 and @entity76 are supported by a specially trained nurse funded by @entity0 charity @entity183 , who help them with @entity17 's condition and dressings			1
@entity189 's father , @entity76 , a bus driver , said when he takes her out , people stare at her because they do n't know what 's wrong with her			0
sometimes he worries that people think he has hurt her @entity22 said : ' our nurse has such a healthy outlook and says @entity196 does n't know she is any different			0
' it 's a normal pain to @entity17 , just like having a headache is to us			0
' we just want her to have a happy life and not be in any pain			0
' she 's inspirational because we think of what she is going through and she does n't let it get to her			0
' ' inspirational ' : @entity22 says she just wants @entity17 to have a happy life and not be in any pain			0
she hopes that by telling @entity12 's story she will raise awareness of the rare condition @entity22 and @entity76 are trying to raise awareness about the condition and the charity @entity183 , after finding there was very little knowledge of @entity0			1
@entity76 , a bus driver , said : ' when we take her out , people stare at her because they do n't know what 's wrong with her			0
' a lot of people think she has chicken pox , but in the summer months when her feet are on show , they assume it 's something terrible			0
