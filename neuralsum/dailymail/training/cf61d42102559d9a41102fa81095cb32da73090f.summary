by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 striker @entity2 is on the verge of completing a move to @entity7 side @entity6 according to reports in @entity9			1
@entity10 claim that the @entity12 international will put pen to paper on saturday after a Â£ 15.5million deal was agreed			1
the 24 - year - old will reportedly sign a five - year deal with @entity19 's side as he has a day away from @entity22 's @entity21 training camp in @entity23			1
stepping up : @entity2 ( centre ) earned himself a place in @entity9 's provisional @entity21 squad after 22 goals for @entity3 last season @entity2 needed a year of transition to @entity30 before he could blossom into one of @entity9 's most lethal strikers			1
following a debut campaign in @entity9 's top flight in which he scored just five goals in 33 league appearances for @entity38 and , after hearing criticism that he was not ready for the big time , @entity2 proved week - in and week - out last season at @entity3 that he does have what it takes			1
the 24 - year - old finished as the ' capocannoniere ' , the top scorer in @entity30 with 22 goals in 33 league appearances and his performances helped @entity3 finish seventh in the league			1
he also made his senior debut with @entity9 in an international friendly against world champions @entity52 in march			1
' last season he struggled but @entity54 has character , ' @entity9 coach @entity22 said			1
' he has a striker 's dna and he has not been affected by negative experiences			2
' many said he was n't ready for @entity30 but now those critics praise him			1
he is doing very well			0
' the journey has not been easy			0
@entity2 joined @entity62 in 2009 but had loan spells at @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
it was at the latter where his career began to take off			0
he scored a @entity71 record 28 goals to help @entity66 finish top in the 2011 - 12 campaign and gain promotion before he joined @entity38			2
' i will always remain a fan of @entity66 , ' @entity2 said			2
' my time there was crucial to grow and improve as a player			0
it was my launchpad to top football			2
' @entity2 's hopes of playing for @entity62 , the club that had signed him at the age of 18 for 80,000 euros , were dashed when the @entity12 giants sold part of his rights to cross-town rivals @entity3 last summer			1
all smiles : immobile shares a joke with team - mate @entity93 during training on wednesday ' despite my ( @entity62 ) past , i was welcomed in the @entity3 camp with a lot of enthusiasm , something i did n't expect would happen , ' @entity2 said			1
' i was very touched			0
' ( @entity3 coach @entity101 ) @entity100 is similar to ( @entity66 coach @entity102 ) @entity103			2
' from a tactical and character standpoint , they have both made me grow as a person and as a player			0
' i will never stop thanking @entity100 because this has been a great step for me			0
' @entity2 forged a potent attacking partnership with @entity111 at @entity3 , with his team - mate notching 13 goals and setting up 11 others in @entity30 @entity22 spoke during the season of @entity111 's unselfishness and it was no surprise when he , too , made @entity9 's squad			1
' i 'm really happy that the national team coach has considered @entity121 and i for the squad , ' @entity2 said			2
' on the pitch we understand each other very well			0
' the year has been so good for @entity2 that the @entity126 has surpassed @entity3 greats @entity127 and @entity129 with a single season record of goals			1
@entity132 's all - time scorer @entity127 and @entity129 had each scored 21 goals			0
wanted man : immobile is on the verge of joining @entity6 according to reports in @entity9 ' to have overtaken two legends like @entity127 and @entity129 gives me great pride , ' he said			1
' i think i am very similar to them in character and also in my mindset to always play my best			0
' i have worked so hard to reach this level but i never expected to have such a season and to lead the goalscoring charts			0
' even though we just missed out on qualifying for @entity154 football next season , our aim this season was for our fans to enjoy watching us play again and i think we have succeeded in doing so			0
' ' it will be difficult to turn down an important offer from abroad			0
but in the future i would love to play for @entity159 , my home club			0
