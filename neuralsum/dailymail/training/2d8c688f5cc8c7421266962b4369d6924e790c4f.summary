by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 10:03 est , 25 july 2013 tarnished reputation : founding father of @entity3 , @entity4 was a member of the @entity5 the city of @entity3 is debating how to deal with the racist past of its founding father @entity4 as he stands accused of inciting a notorious race riot			1
a new magazine , @entity11 , has highlighted @entity4 's role in creating a racist atmosphere in the town before the riot in 1921			1
when @entity4 arrived in 1890 from @entity16 , @entity3 was just a few dirt streets and tents occupied by white men seeking their fortune in uncharted @entity22 lands			1
the ambitious shoe salesman saw an opportunity and seized it , opening a general store , followed by a hotel			0
by the time @entity27 became a state in 1907 , @entity4 was a celebrated city father			1
he signed @entity3 's incorporation papers , started a newspaper and chartered a train filled with boosters , including humorist @entity33 , to promote the new boomtown to people in the @entity36			1
however , a lesser - known side of @entity4 has become the focus of debate in his adopted hometown nearly 90 years after his death			2
the son of a @entity44 veteran , @entity4 was a member of the local @entity5			2
and new questions have emerged about his involvement in the most notorious event in @entity3 history , a 1921 race riot that left 300 black residents dead			1
the issue is especially sensitive because @entity4 's name is all over town - on a street , a mansion , a theatre and a historic neighborhood			1
it is also the name of the city 's most ambitious development effort in a generation - a glitzy downtown entertainment district			2
@entity4 's membership in the @entity5 was never a secret			1
it had been noted in @entity3 's historical records but was largely forgotten until the new @entity3 - based literary magazine , this land , published a long article in late 2011 by author @entity71 , who detailed klan activities and @entity4 's involvement with the group			1
specifically , the article said , @entity4 created an environment of racism that led to the riot			1
honoured : @entity4 's name currently appears all over the city of @entity3 , @entity27 dozens of businesses were looted and burned to the ground , and the chaos decimated the @entity83 , where grocers , newspapers , prominent doctors and attorneys had thrived in an area historians often call the @entity89			1
even before the article was published , @entity3 had struggled to come to terms with its racial past			1
black leaders had complained that the riot has been downplayed in local history			2
the city council , community leaders and residents are weighing what to do about a once - proud name that is suddenly tainted			0
' there are councilors who are concerned and ashamed that we have this name , and we know what mr. @entity4 stood for , ' said @entity106 , the council 's lone black member who plans to introduce a law thursday to rename @entity109 as @entity110			1
black people account for roughly 16 percent of the city 's population of 400,000			2
towering figure : the @entity115 pictured nearly 90 years after his death @entity106 's proposal , which is expected to come to a vote next week , reflects a recently discovered 1907 document on which someone crossed out @entity110 and wrote @entity109 in its place			0
the downtown area is ' growing like it 's never grown before , ' @entity106 said in an interview			0
' so changing the name of the street is n't going to stop the momentum			0
' the council has asked business owners in the new @entity130 about the name , which is widely used in promotional marketing			0
the owners opposed any name change , concluding that it 's better to be reminded of the city 's checkered past in order to create a better world			2
' rather than seeking to revise history , today 's residents , visitors and merchants should regard the name as a demonstration of a new set of principles , ' they said in a july 14 letter			2
" removing the name is to surrender to the past			0
' business owners have also protested that changing the name of the street would confuse visitors and hurt sales , among other concerns			0
most politicians have remained mum on the issue			0
others quarrel with the idea that @entity4 was a major instigator of the riot			1
mayor @entity164 said he 's read accounts that showed disagreement over @entity4 's role in the unrest			1
the mayor wants to keep the @entity4 name , citing concern that the renaming effort could become a slippery slope for other streets and landmarks named after people with questionable pasts			1
race riot : this picture from june 1 , 1921 , shows @entity3 's @entity83 during race riots that left 300 black people dead ' we look at history as a good teacher , not something to emulate , obviously , but in this case something to learn from and avoid , ' @entity164 said in an interview			1
' my opinion , i guess , is that i have not heard a strong groundswell of support for changing the name and to what ? what are we going to call it next ? ' the entertainment district is at the core of @entity3 's effort to rejuvenate its moribund downtown , which had long been pocked with half - empty offices , blank storefronts and weeds			1
the improvements come after the city invested decades , and many millions of dollars , in failed attempts to revive the area			0
today the district has been reborn			0
it has a new ballpark , boutiques , a cigar bar , trendy restaurants and a museum and park dedicated to @entity27 's @entity216 balladeer , @entity217			0
man of influence : @entity4 with his wife , @entity220 the elegant @entity221 is one of the jewels , opened by @entity4 in 1914 as the biggest arena between @entity225 and @entity226			2
it 's now a popular showplace for indie and classic rock shows			0
' we 've been here over six years , and no one seemed to notice or care ' about renaming @entity109 , said @entity235 , executive director of the @entity236 , one of many specialty shops that have taken root along the street in question			0
' the success is finally here , and now we think we need to put someone else 's name on it			0
' others say the name can serve as an omnipresent reminder of ' never again ' as the city moves ahead			0
' it 's like changing the name of the city of @entity3 because it has a racist past , ' said @entity255 , a @entity257 transplant and teacher , who is black and lives in the @entity259			1
' where do you stop ? ' @entity262 , a white resident of the historic district , agrees , saying the city need not dredge up the battles of the past			0
' it 's not going to change anything , ' she said			0
confusion over the name seems especially apparent in the @entity259 neighborhood , a section of large , nearly 100 - year - old homes , including the @entity272 - style mansion @entity4 built in 1920 and named @entity273 , after @entity276 's @entity275 estate			1
once home to business barons , the neighborhood is now is full of young families in fixer - uppers and newcomers to the city			0
until recently , many never even knew who the district was named for			0
still , ' you do n't revamp history , ' said @entity292 , who lives with her parents in @entity4 's old mansion , which has been turned back into a single - family house after being divided up in apartments			2
' you should n't forget who @entity4 was , but you keep history the way it is			2

chequered past of @entity3 's founding father raises questions over his presence around the town 's landmarks and public spaces
@entity4 is accused of instigating infamous 1921 race riot
riot left 300 black residents of @entity3 dead in just 18 hours
some locals are questioning his honour of having his name all over town
