@entity1 officials could n't believe their luck last week when a suspected @entity5 commander who heard there was a $ 100 reward for his whereabouts turned himself in to authorities			1
perhaps misunderstanding the meaning of ' wanted ' , @entity9 sauntered up to police in @entity12 , @entity13 province , with a poster bearing his own face - and demanded the finder 's fee			2
officers arrested @entity9 on the spot , the @entity18 reported			0
nevertheless , when @entity1 forces went to confirm @entity9 had come forward they were understandably incredulous			1
' imbecile ' : the poster offering a $ 100 reward for information on the whereabouts of @entity9 - which he took with him when he tried to claim the money ' we asked him , " is this you ? " ' spc @entity29 told the @entity18			2
' @entity9 answered with an incredible amount of enthusiasm , " yes , yes , that ’s me ! can i get my award now ? " ' biometric checks confirmed that the man @entity39 police were holding was the alleged insurgent @entity1 troops had been looking for			1
he is suspected of plotting at least two attacks on @entity39 security forces and his face was on hundreds of posters plastered all over the district			0
@entity47 forces often distribute wanted posters , but they are rarely so effective			0
civilians are usually afraid to pass on information for fear of reprisals , and @entity5 fighters themselves usually avoid urban areas when they are being hunted			0
but not it seems , @entity9			0
' clearly , ' one @entity1 official told the @entity18 , ' the man is an imbecile			1
' @entity9 's effort to claim the reward money on his head may have been a misguided attempt to replicate the recent taunts of the @entity64 made by @entity66 militant @entity65 brazen : @entity65 , 61 , told the @entity1 it should give $ 10million reward for his whereabouts to him , claiming he had made no secret of his movements the 61 - year - old founder of militant group @entity72 mocked @entity1 officials who put a £ 10million bounty on his head , saying they should give the reward money to him , as he had made no secret of his whereabouts			1
speaking to a news conference near to @entity66 's military headquarters earlier this month , he boasted : ' i am here , i am visible			0
@entity1 should give that reward money to me			1
' i will be in @entity83 tomorrow			0
@entity1 can contact me whenever it wants to			1
' @entity65 has been accused of orchestrating the 2008 attacks in the @entity86 city of @entity87 that killed 166 people , including six @entity1 citizens			2
but he operates openly in @entity66 , giving public speeches and appearing on tv talk shows .			0

' clearly , the man is an imbecile , ' @entity1 official says
