chic in a tailored cream jacket and a neat black dress , @entity2 's @entity1 @entity0 was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for her husband @entity7 's speech at the @entity9 today			1
but for once , she had serious competition , which came in the shape of the @entity13 ' equally glamorous @entity12			2
the two were in @entity15 for the 69th session of the @entity17 , which includes a debate in which both @entity7 and @entity19 are due to speak			2
so which is your favourite palace ? the royal pair compare notes as they chat with another delegate at the @entity9 with no speech of their own to make , the two sat together and chatted as they waited for proceedings to begin and , at one point , burst into laughter			1
it was all a far cry from the serious business on monday , when the @entity2 queen and her husband spent the day meeting scientists living and working in @entity15			0
but with @entity7 due to make a big speech putting the case for his country 's inclusion in the @entity38 , @entity0 and @entity12 soon sobered up and watched intently as the debate began			1
both @entity12 , 43 , and @entity0 , 42 , are relatively new to their thrones , with the @entity2 queen ascending to the throne in june and her @entity13 counterpart a year earlier			1
lots in common : both @entity0 and @entity12 are relative newcomers to the business of monarchy serious business : their husbands , @entity7 and @entity19 , were both due to make speeches paying attention : the royal pair listen as the speech - making gets underway at the @entity17 meeting hard at work : @entity7 and @entity1 @entity0 spent monday meeting @entity2 scientists working in the @entity59 like the @entity61 , both are mothers to young children and have taken a keen interest in children 's charities since being handed the top job			1
but while @entity0 's reign has so far gone smoothly , @entity12 and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks to the @entity72 tragedy , which left the @entity13 reeling			1
nevertheless , the popularity of the @entity75 - born @entity13 queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the @entity72 families			0
she has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside prime minister @entity82 as the first flight arrived back on @entity13 soil			0
traditional : @entity12 , looking glamorous in crimson , arrives for @entity19 's @entity87 speech glamorous : a crimson - clad @entity12 and her husband @entity19 were cheered last week despite the tragedy , the @entity13 royal couple were cheered to the rafters when they appeared on the balcony of the @entity95 in the @entity96 on @entity87 , along with former @entity97 , 76			2
@entity0 too has become increasingly popular since ascending to the throne in june , making regular appearances in support of children 's and disability charities , as well as on the arm of husband @entity7 , 46			2
most recently , @entity0 found herself on the receiving end of a slew of positive headlines after stopping to greet a wheelchair - bound well - wisher who had travelled to the @entity2 city of @entity109 to meet her			0
her hair whipping around her shoulders , @entity0 ignored the unseasonably miserable weather as she bent down to chat to the elderly lady			0
the engagement , which took place days before she and @entity7 travelled to @entity15 , was part of an unusually intense september schedule which looks set to be replicated over the coming month			0
friendly : @entity0 stops to greet an elderly well - wisher during an appearance in @entity109 last week busy schedule : @entity7 and @entity0 have been working at a breakneck pace over the past month			0

queen @entity0 and @entity12 sat together during their @entity9 visit
both had come to hear husbands make speeches to the @entity17
appeared to enjoy the experience and chatted *happily* throughout debate
