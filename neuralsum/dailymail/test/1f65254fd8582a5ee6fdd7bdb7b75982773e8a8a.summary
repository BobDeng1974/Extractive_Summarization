@entity1 , 17 , whose username is @ saskiaisabxlla , posted excerpts of the exam on monday with the message ‘ @entity15 made me take an @ @entity3 exam			1
’ for @entity1 ( surname withheld ) , the stakes were high before she scored 43.5 out of a possible 50 points , or 87 per cent			1
by the grading system of her boyfriend , who did n’t want to be identified , that constitutes an @entity24 @entity1 , 17 , aced the ' @entity3 exam ' given by her boyfriend with a score of 43.5 out of 50 or 87 per cent ‘ well done , @entity1			1
as a result , i will not be dumping you [ lucky you ] , ’ he wrote in red pen on the cover of the test along with some feedback			1
the post has since been retweeted 9,600 times , almost five times for each of her 1,900 or so followers , with widespread congratulations coming from @entity6 fans			2

’ her responses included ‘ @entity45 is buff ’ and that ‘ he scores a lot of goals ’			0
a derogatory comment about @entity46 , the newly crowned @entity53 , got extra marks			0
she told @entity56 : ' after the @entity3 vs @entity59 game the previous sunday , he told me " i might make make an @entity3 exam for you "			1
at first i thought he was joking but then i thought it would be funny to do it			0
' over the time that we have been together i managed to adopt his interest and learnt a lot about football in the process			0
so the following day i took it under his watch to make sure i did n't cheat			2
he marked it based on his own grade boundaries and i did better than he expected			0
' i tweeted it the same evening , but we never expected it to get this far			0
i 've had mixed reception but most of it was positive , some even calling him a " legend "			0
he said that our relationship was on the line but he was bluffing and used it as a tool to motivate me			0
' a few took it too seriously but at the end of the day it was just something that we did together for fun and was meant to be humorous and lighthearted			0
' @entity1 correctly identified the @entity3 away strip although she did n't recall the score of the 2014 @entity101 final club loyalty was an important part of the exam and @entity1 knew the score when it came to @entity106 @entity1 ’s recall of last year ’s @entity101 final was also tested , but she must n’t have been paying attention that day when the @entity6 beat @entity110 3 - 2 ( not 2 - 0 ) and @entity111 scored the winner ( not @entity113 )			1
after correctly identifying a yellow @entity6 shirt as the away strip , @entity1 was asked to name the entire @entity3 starting @entity116 with their positions for 22 points			1
she faltered only in calling @entity119 a defender , @entity121 a midfielder instead of a striker ( harsh marking ) and leaving out @entity124 altogether			0
@entity45 ' is buff , ' says @entity1 in one answer ; although she thought @entity119 was a defender in her boyfriend ’s feedback he advised @entity1 to ‘ learn all player positions ’ and how she is supposed to feel about @entity129 rivals @entity128			1
‘ i salute your boyfriend ! and you deserve a medal for being such a sport ! ’ tweeted @entity131 ( ‏ @entity132 ) .			2
