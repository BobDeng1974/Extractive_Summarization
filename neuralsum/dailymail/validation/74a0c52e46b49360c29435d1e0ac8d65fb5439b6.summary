mr @entity0 said a strong showing for @entity2 at may 's election could boost the calls for electoral reform , which in turn could make his eurosceptics a ' big party in @entity13 politics '			1
he said : ' i 've always thought there should be election reform but that is frankly irrelevant in the next 38 days			0
' yes , this is very hard for us because you find good @entity2 support in @entity49 constituencies and in conservative constituencies			2
' yes , that 's a challenge but what we have to do is to get over the line in enough seats in this general election campaign and then you 'll see how many seats we 've actually come second in , and you 'll realise as part of a longer - term strategy this really could become a big party in @entity13 politics			1
' mr @entity0 was mobbed by photographers , camera people and journalists as he arrived in @entity65 in central @entity23 to unveil the poster truck			0

last year mr @entity0 warned that people would not vote for @entity2 unless he broadened its appeal beyond his own profile			2
' i do n't think people will vote for us in a general election in big numbers if they think it 's a one - man band			0
i intend to change that over the summer , ' he said in may 2014			0
but mr @entity0 today brushed aside questions about the use of his photograph on the card			0
he said : ' the thing about @entity2 is we have become the most eclectic , diverse political party			1
' we 've got all shades of opinion , we 've got people from the left , people from the right , people of all ages , all classes , all races			0
' we are quite reflective i think now as a party of what modern @entity13 is			1
' mr @entity0 insisted that smaller parties will have major influence in an election which no party will win outright responding to @entity2 's pledge card , a @entity130 spokesman said : ' @entity2 's pledge card should instead be a p45 for each of three million people whose jobs benefit from our membership of the @entity15			1

the @entity2 leader - who will later kick off his party 's campaign by announcing its key policies - told @entity152 's @entity151 : ' i 'm up for it			1
' we have got massive public support for our views on proper immigration controls and the need for an @entity160 - style points system			0
as we have shown before , we have come from behind in many elections to win in the past			0
' we are going to win a good number of seats in @entity165 , but with the best will in the world , i am not going to be prime minister			0
' he added : ' i 'm a straight - talking person , i 'm honest - @entity2 are not going to win the general election			2
but you know what ? no - one is going to win the general election			0
there will be nobody with a clear majority			0
' the question is what parties will have enough power to coalesce around the other parties ? ' he said @entity183 had never wanted to hold a referendum on @entity13 's @entity15 membership , and had been ' forced into ' his vow to stage a poll by the end of 2017			1
' our job in the next @entity31 would be to hold his feet to the fire , to make sure that the referendum is not a stitch - up , ' he said			0
' i do n't want this to be kicked into the long grass until the end of 2017			1
i think it should be before the end of this year			0

' what we have just passed through is the phoney war			0

but he insisted : ' we are through all of that			0
what we have now got to talk about is an election campaign in which the biggest issue in voters ' minds is the impact of immigration on public services and on people 's incomes ... i think @entity2 , over the next 38 days , is going to connect with people			1
' he said he stood by his position that discrimination laws should be relaxed , so employers can favour @entity13 workers over those from other @entity15 nations			1
' i think that to have an open door and to have mass migration of unskilled and semi-skilled labour is bad for @entity13 people , because it has driven down wages and how does that make sense ? ' said mr @entity0			2
' what may be good for big business is n't necessarily good for millions of @entity13 families			2

@entity2 leader insists his party is ' more in tune ' with the @entity13 public
