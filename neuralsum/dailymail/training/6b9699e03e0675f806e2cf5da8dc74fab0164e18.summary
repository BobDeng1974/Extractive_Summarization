a @entity1 teenager has invented a device that he claims could clean up some 20 billion tonnes of plastic waste from the world 's oceans			1
@entity6 , 19 , came up with the idea of a series of floating booms and processing platforms designed to collect floating plastic rubbish			1
the ' ocean cleanup ' concept is designed to capture the floating plastic but allow life like fish and plankton to pass through unharmed , while saving the waste materials to be recycled			1
the design is self - sufficient and saves energy by being tethered to the sea bed ( pictured ) the @entity30 is an anchored network of floating booms and processing platforms will span the radius of a gyre			1
the booms act as giant funnels where the angle of the booms effectively ' suck ' rubbish in			0
the debris enters the platforms , where it will be filtered out of the water and eventually stored in containers until collected for recycling on land			0
one of the most significant advantages of using booms instead of nets is that marine life can not be caught in them			0
furthermore , because the transport of plastic along the booms is driven by the currents , it ’s slow enough for organisms to escape			0
the engineering student believes that once operational , his device could dramatically reduce the amount of rubbish in the oceans in just five years time			1
millions of tonnes of plastic debris are littering oceans and have accumulated in areas of high concentration called gyres - which are essentially floating rubbish tips			1
this litter directly kills millions of aquatic animals annually but also spreads and introduces harmful algae and invasive species as well as man - made pollutants into the food chain , costing governments and organisations millions of dollars to clean up every year , according to mr @entity6			1
mr @entity6 believes his invention could make up to $ 500 million a year from recycling the waste collected ( pictured ) making it a potentially profitable clean - up solution while he believes humans must end their reliance on disposable plastic items and manage waste responsibly , his innovation could make a big difference to the cleanliness of oceans in the shorter - term			1
he proposes fixing sea water processors to the sea bed , which are also attached to the floating platform so that the water can move through them and generate energy			0
his concept also includes using floating booms instead of nets to cover vast areas of water effectively , while no mesh and a very low speed , means there will be ' virtually no by - catch ' and unfortunate animals getting tangled in nets that are meant to help conserve their habitat			2
his concept uses floating booms ( pictured ) instead of nets to cover wast areas effectively , while no mesh and a very low speed , means there will be ' virtually no by - catch ' and unfortunate animals getting tangled in nets the litter in the oceans directly kills millions of aquatic animals annually ( like this bird with a stomach - full of plastic ) but also spreads and introduces harmful algae and invasive species as well as man made pollutants into the food chain writing on his website , mr @entity6 said : ' although this hypothesis still has to be tested , even the planktonic species - due to their density being close to that of the sea water - may move under the booms along with the water flow			1
' in a bid to solve problems of conventional clean - up measures , including rubbish escaping , emissions and high costs , he said his contraptions are ' completely self - supportive ' and get their energy from the sun and waves			2
' by letting the platforms ' wings sway like an actual manta ray , we can ensure contacts of the inlets with the surface , even in the roughest weather , ' he said			0
millions of tonnes of plastic debris are littering oceans and have accumulated in areas of high concentration called gyres ( pictured by the circles of arrows ) which are essentially floating rubbish tips while mr @entity6 ( pictured ) is now a student at the @entity161 , he came up with the idea while he as at school to win a number of prizes as well as solving an environmental problem , mr @entity6 also believes his invention could make up to $ 500 million a year from recycling the waste collected			1
he said : ' this concept is so efficient , that we estimate that by selling the plastic retrieved from the 5 gyres , we would make in fact more money than the plan would cost to execute			2
in other words ; it may potentially be profitable			0
' mr @entity6 believes that many people need reminding about the environmental disaster affecting the @entity181 's oceans			2
he said : ' one of the problems with preventive work is that there is n’t any imagery of these ‘ garbage patches ’ because the debris is dispersed over millions of square kilometres			0
' ' by placing our arrays however , it will accumulate along the booms , making it suddenly possible to actually visualise the oceanic garbage patches			0
we need to stress the importance of recycling , and reducing our consumption of plastic packaging , ' vr - zone reported			0
while mr @entity6 is now a student at the @entity161 , he came up with the idea while he as at school to win a number of prizes and the respect of more experiences marine experts			2
he has now set up @entity209 to raise funds to develop his innovation .			0

device could remove 20 billion tonnes of plastic from the world 's oceans
@entity6 came up with the idea of a series of floating booms and processing platforms designed to ' suck ' in floating plastic rubbish
the *young* engineering student 's ' ocean cleanup ' concept is designed to be self sufficient and harness energy from the sun and waves
his invention could even make money by selling the plastic collected from the oceans , which kills millions of animals every year
