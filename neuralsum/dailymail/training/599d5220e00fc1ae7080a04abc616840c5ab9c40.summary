partners in crime : @entity41 , 28 , pictured left , and @entity42 , 49 , pictured right , have also been jailed for conspiracy to supply drugs ' they used @entity42 ’s home as their hideout from which to cut up the drugs into smaller quantities and sell on to make significant profit			1

' mobile phone analysis not only showed that @entity7 and @entity65 were close friends , but the sheer volume of text messages about drug debts and deals showed this sort of criminality was their way of life , and their way of making money			0
' these convictions are a fantastic result for @entity134 because two determined drug dealers are now behind bars , but more than anything it is a victory for the community who , for too long , have had to put up with the likes of @entity41 and @entity7 mistakenly thinking that can " run " this part of @entity183 and act with impunity			2
' drug dealers like these can all too often cause misery and hardship among law - abiding residents who may be too scared to speak up for fear of reprisals			0
' with these men off the streets , we have not only made a huge dent into the supply of drugs in this area but also sent a powerful message that no - one is above the law			0
' @entity134 will work hand - in - hand with residents to remove these corrosive elements from our communities and make them safer places			0
