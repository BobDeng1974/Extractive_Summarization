president @entity0 bungled the response to the @entity2 and ' waited too long ' to engage the terrorist group , the nation 's 39th president , @entity4 , said tuesday			1
@entity0 's current approach to fighting @entity7 in @entity8 has a ' possibility of success , ' @entity4 added , but only if ground troops do their part			1
@entity4 , a @entity13 who served as president for one term in the late seventies , held little back when asked about the current occupant of the @entity19 by the @entity20 on tuesday			1
in an interview at the work site on tuesday , @entity4 gave a biting critique of @entity0 's foreign policies @entity4 and his wife , @entity32 , joined @entity27 and @entity33 , along with thousands of volunteers , in building twenty new homes in seven days in the @entity37 neighborhood of @entity25			1
they are pictured here yesterday preparing a siding board for attachment to one of the homes the retired politician said he supported @entity0 's candidacy but disagrees with the way he 's handled several foreign policy issues , including the ascent of @entity7			1
' first of all , we waited too long [ to get involved ] , ' he said			0
' we let the @entity2 build up its money , capability and strength and weapons while it was still in @entity53			0
' then when [ @entity7 ] moved into @entity8 , the @entity54 did n’t object to their being there and about a third of the territory in @entity8 was abandoned			2
' @entity4 seemed skeptical that @entity0 's current plan of attack would yield the desired result			1
' if we keep on working in @entity8 and have some ground troops to follow up when we do our bombing , there is a possibility of success , ' he stated			2
he did not indicate who should supply the soldiers , the @entity69 , @entity8 or some other country			1
ground forces are also needed in @entity53 , @entity4 said			2
' you have to have somebody on the ground to direct our missiles and to be sure you have the right target			0
then you have to have somebody to move in and be willing to fight @entity7 after the strikes , ' he explained			0
president @entity0 and his administration have already set to work on recruiting moderate rebels of the government to serve as the @entity69 ' eyes and ears on the ground in @entity53			1
before @entity87 left @entity88 for an extended recess last month , it authorized a weapons and training program for members of the @entity93			0

part of the problem with @entity0 's approach , @entity4 said , is that it 's been inconsistent			1
' it changes from time to time , ' he said			0
' i noticed that two of his secretaries of defense , after they got out of office , were very critical of the lack of positive action on the part of the president			0
' @entity4 was referring to former administration officials @entity127 and @entity128			2
both of have released unflattering memoirs on their time working for @entity0 since retiring from government service			0
@entity127 's book , @entity134 : a memoir of @entity136 in @entity137 , was released just yesterday			0
in promoting it , he derided @entity0 in numerous times for not arming rebels in @entity53 sooner and for refusing to leave troops behind in @entity8 when the @entity69 ended its years long occupation of the country			1
@entity4 also noted his opposition to @entity0 's drone program			1
' i really object to the killing of people , particularly @entity69 overseas who have n’t been brought to justice and put on trial , ' he said			2
' we ’ve killed four @entity69 overseas with @entity69 drones			2
to me that violates our @entity155 and human rights			0
' when it comes to replacing @entity0 in 2017 , the year his second and final term will come to an end , @entity4 was slightly more reserved , however			1
' it ’s too early to speculate about the next presidential election , ' he stated			0
' i think @entity162 [ @entity163 ] is a real possibility , ' he noted , but did n't give any clues as to whether she 'd have his support in the primary			0
' whoever the @entity103 candidate is , the @entity170 will vote for them , ' the former president said .			0
