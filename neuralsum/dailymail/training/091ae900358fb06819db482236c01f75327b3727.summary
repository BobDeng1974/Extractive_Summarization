injured : @entity3 has withdrawn from the @entity1 squad for the friendly against @entity7 recovery : @entity14 's @entity4 has been rested after an injury - hit season for the @entity20 this week 's game is also @entity7 's last friendly before they fly to @entity24 for the @entity25 and their manager @entity26 has voiced frustration @entity1 are not at full strength			1
@entity0 is also disappointed not to have the pair , but he feels the rest of the players could benefit from the experience ahead of @entity34 qualifying			1
@entity0 said : ' they 'd be a loss to any team in the world because they are top - quality players and you always want them in your team , but it is not to be			1
' we have 10 qualifying games and we may not have them for one or two games and we have to adapt to that			0
' we went to @entity47 with 15 players missing and we got a super performance from the lads who were with us ( drawing 1 - 1 last october )			2
' that is what we need whoever we have got			0
if we are missing @entity3 and @entity4 we just have to get on with it as we have a job to do			1
' we are up against a world - class team and that is how it is			0
' annoyed : @entity7 boss @entity26 is irked by @entity1 ' failure to produce a full - strength squad wales have a number of other senior players missing , most notably @entity64 and @entity65 , and are travelling with an inexperienced squad			1
defenders @entity67 and @entity69 , of @entity70 and @entity71 respectively , could be handed first caps			0
another potential debutant is 20 - year - old @entity75 midfielder @entity74 , who came to prominence last month when handed a surprise @entity78 start against @entity70 by @entity80 interim boss @entity79			2
@entity82 's highly - rated youngster @entity81 , who featured against @entity83 in march , could get another chance			0
@entity86 defender @entity85 , 18 , @entity88 midfielder @entity87 , 20 , and @entity90 midfielder @entity89 , 18 , could also be in the reckoning			0
the future : @entity0 has taken the opportunity to call up some youngsters into the @entity1 squad @entity0 said : ' they are all at different stages as some had their season finish three weeks ago and others earlier than that			1
' but when we took this game we knew what we were doing and we knew it would be a tough game and we knew we 'd have some players missing			0
' we thought we would have a weakened squad but the lads who are here have been good			0
' our @entity112 campaign is two years and 10 games and every squad i 've picked the one that turns up is always different			0
' we need to give all of these guys experience of playing international football because you never know when you are going to have to call on them			2
' no doubt in the next two years we will be calling on them so they need experience of playing at this level , playing a team like @entity7 , who are a top - level team			1
' the only way they can get used to it is by experiencing it so we do n't have any fear			0
' we are full of respect of @entity7 but we have our own way of doing things and we will stick to that			2
' @entity0 may be without @entity3 this week but he has been hugely impressed by the 24 - year - old since his world record Â£ 85million move to @entity140 last summer			1
@entity3 scored a stunning goal to win the @entity142 for @entity10 and then topped that with a decisive header in the @entity11 final			2
@entity0 said : ' to do what he has done in his first year - he had a huge input in them winning the @entity11 and it does n't get much better than that			1
' they have won two cups and @entity10 are that one team where the @entity11 is the @entity152 and they have achieved that			0
