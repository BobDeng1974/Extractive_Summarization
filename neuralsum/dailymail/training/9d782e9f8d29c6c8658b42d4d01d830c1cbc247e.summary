with their doors dented and their paintwork badly scratched , this was how £ 30million - worth of @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 emerged from a carrier ship today after it ran around just off the @entity10 coast three weeks ago			1
the @entity11 , carrying 1,400 luxury cars including a £ 260,000 rolls @entity13 , was deliberately grounded on @entity14 in the @entity15 to stop it capsizing on january 3			1
while a spokesman for the shipping company today described the damage to the cars as ' limited ' , there are fears the entire fleet could have to be scrapped after a similar accident in 2006 lead to 4,700 @entity26 being destroyed			1
the cars were sent to the crusher after transporter @entity29 partially capsized in the @entity31 while carrying a load of @entity26 away from the factory			1

this @entity56 was left with large scratches and dents to its bodywork a spokesman for the shipping line described the damage today as ' limited ' , but in 2006 a shipment of @entity26 in a similar condition were destroyed after resting at sea for three weeks at an angle of 60 degrees - almost identical conditions to the @entity68 initially a @entity70 spokesman said that only 68 cars had been damaged in the crash , either by slipping their moorings or rolling into other vehicles , but it was eventually decided that all 4,700 vehicles needed to be crushed			1
engineers were worried about what effect resting at such a severe angle for so long would have on the inner workings of the cars , especially on the electrolyte in the batteries			0
rather than open themselves up to the possibility of lawsuits due to mechanical faults , the company decided that it was safer to scrap the lot			0
the @entity68 was deliberately run aground after it started to list at 52 degrees , a similar angle to the @entity29 , just after leaving @entity93 port			1

back ashore : a red @entity117 f - type is driven back on to dry land after spending three weeks stranded on board the @entity36 valuable : the ship 's cargo is thought to be worth £ 30million , leaving a huge bill for the accident if the cars have to be written off dozens of @entity4 are on board , as well as @entity5 , and the incident could run into costs of tens of millions of pounds of damage @entity70 engineers were concerned about what effect resting at such a severe angle would have on the cars , particularly on the electrolytes in the batteries			1
if inspectors take the same decision over the @entity68 ( pictured ) , then the bill for the accident could run into tens of millions the transporter was also carrying up to 80 agricultural or building plant machines , including a large stone - cutter machine weighing more than 30 tonnes			1
high winds and heavy rain hampered the rescue operation - even causing one of the tugs to smash into the @entity68 as it was being towed			0

' it is not yet known which vehicles were damaged by the sea water inside the ship and the spokesman said the vehicles were owned by ' a variety of parties ' - including dealers and private owners			2
cars which are damaged or do not start up will be towed off the ship			2
the spokesman said only preliminary checks had been carried out at this stage and a full assessment would be completed once every car was back on dry land , so they could make a decision about what to do with damaged vehicles			0

the @entity11 was deliberately grounded in the @entity15 on january 3 after it started to list at 52 degrees
cars had dents and scratches , though a spokesman for the shipping line described the damage as ' limited '
however entire fleet may need to be scrapped after a similar accident in 2006 lead to 4,700 @entity26 being crushed
