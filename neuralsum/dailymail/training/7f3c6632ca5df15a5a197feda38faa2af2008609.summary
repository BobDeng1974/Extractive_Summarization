@entity0 , pictured at a press conference for @entity2 , says that seeing the character on screen ‘ was hard even for me – and i ’d played the role ' the film is a dark blend of betrayal , gore and suspense – and its leading character a chilling femme fatale riven by jealousy and loathing			1
so it is perhaps not surprising that five gruelling weeks spent playing psychotic @entity15 in the hit thriller @entity2 left @entity18 actress @entity0 traumatised and physically drained			1
but the instant the cameras stopped rolling , @entity0 , 35 , made a momentous decision – she knew she wanted to have a baby ... straight away			1
‘ after filming i just knew i had to go out there and make a human being , ’ says the @entity24 - educated actress , patting her bump beneath her loose - fitting white @entity27 dress			2
‘ the film was so tough and such a hard experience that the instant i ’d finished i thought , “ i need to bring something positive into the world			1
life is good with little people around			2
” ’ @entity0 , who already has a two - year - old son called @entity38 with her partner , @entity40 businessman @entity39 , is now seven months ' pregnant with her second child			1
but the happy domesticity she now radiates could hardly be in greater contrast to @entity2 ’s @entity15 , who is at war with her cheating husband			0
indeed , with the birth of her new child just weeks away , @entity0 found it disturbing watching the film at last month ’s premiere in @entity51			1
@entity2 , based on @entity53 ’s addictive bestseller of the same name , is the tale of a marital meltdown in which @entity15 goes missing on her fifth wedding anniversary , leaving behind a scene that suggests her husband @entity59 ( @entity60 ) has harmed her			0
what starts out as psychological warfare descends into a gory bloodbath			0
‘ seeing it on screen was hard even for me – and i ’d played the role , ’ says @entity0 in an exclusive interview with @entity65			1
‘ as a pregnant woman i felt so far away from that narcissistic woman			2
‘ it ’s the sort of part that does make you look at yourself and wonder where the movie role ends and the real self begins			2
‘ i thought , “ i ’d better make sure this is all buried away			0
i do n’t want to release any of this when i get home			0
” the role was tough because there are scenes of great violence in the film – physical and psychological			1
the script just gets into your veins , as though someone is injecting toxins into you			0
’ luckily , @entity39 , 53 , and @entity38 were able to join her while the film was being made , providing some much - needed distraction			1
‘ if you have a little boy , you walk through the door at home and you get on to the floor with some @entity98 – that ’s a wonderful antidote , ’ @entity0 reveals			1
’ while her blossoming career may mean moving to @entity108 from @entity40 full - time , the actress is determined that neither of her children will become @entity113 brats			0
‘ i look at all of the kids who are wearing t - shirts saying “ @entity116 ” or “ i ’m @entity117 ” or “ i ’m @entity118 ” or “ my mommy thinks i ’m @entity120 ” or whatever , and they ’re encouraged in school to sing songs about why they are special , and it ’s just got out of hand			0
' it ’s really prevalent – expectations are sky - high for kids these days			0
’ though clearly a doting mother , @entity0 , pictured here with her partner , @entity40 businessman @entity39 with their son @entity38 , two , she takes her career seriously which has been more steady than stellar she adds : ‘ i think we are living in a narcissism epidemic			1
we ’re encouraged to share our lives in a way that is presented as fun			0
' but what it really means is that we end up editing them – we want to make it seem that we are more enviable , and having a better time , and going to more amazing parties than all our friends are			0
‘ if you watch people taking photographs of each other now , you see that everyone is aware of the cameras in the room and everyone is aware of how they want to be seen , and immediately thinks , “ @entity157 , change my expression , i do n’t want to make that face for the camera			2
” @entity0 , pictured here with @entity60 in a scene from @entity2 in which she played a dark role , said after a tough day of filming she would wind down by playing with her son @entity38			1
' if you have a little boy , you walk through the door at home and you get on to the floor with some @entity98 – that ’s a wonderful antidote ’ ‘ but if you look at old albums from your parents ’ or grandparents ’ generation , there ’s an amazing candour in people ’s faces you just do n’t get these days			0
’ though clearly a doting mother , there is no doubt how seriously @entity0 takes her career			1
to date , however , her track record has been more steady than stellar			0
although she played supporting roles in a number of @entity113 films , a big breakthrough role had proved elusive ... until now			2
she discovered from @entity189 director @entity188 that she had been cast while filming in the @entity190			2
@entity0 , pictured in merry spirits after a night out at a function in @entity193 this month , says she 's been ready for tougher roles for years and says she was ready to ' get out of all the boxes i 've been put into ' ‘ i ’ve been ready for tougher roles for years , ’ she insists			1
‘ i was ready to get out of all the boxes i ’ve been put into ... for someone to call on me for the dark role			2
i felt as though i ’d never been stretched			0
‘ even though i ’ve played a variety of roles i ’m still seen in the same light : the reserved , cool one from @entity24			0
‘ when i first met @entity188 , he probably wanted to see whether i had the guts for the role , or whether i was some sort of precious little @entity209 flower who did n’t want to get my hands dirty – which , of course , was n’t the case			1
‘ i ’ve been fortunate enough to have had some lovely roles where i am not the main focus – now i was ready to do something like this			0
