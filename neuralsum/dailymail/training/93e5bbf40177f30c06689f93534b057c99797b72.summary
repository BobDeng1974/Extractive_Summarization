by @entity0 , royal correspondent last updated at 12:57 pm on 11th november 2011 prince @entity1 will undertake a six - week tour of duty in the @entity3 early next year , the 30th anniversary of the conflict			1
the future king , an @entity7 pilot , will fly to the @entity8 in february for the posting without his new wife			2
the timing of @entity1 ’s deployment is hugely sensitive and is certain to antagonise the @entity14 government , which continues to assert a territorial claim to the islands despite defeat at the hands of @entity20 forces in 1982			1
keen to go : prince @entity1 at the controls of a @entity22 , which he will be co-piloting on a six - week tour of the @entity3 early next year talked at length : the @entity1 and his wife , the @entity27 , pictured on a visit to a @entity30 centre in @entity31 on november 2 , will be apart for nearly two months			1
but she is said to be very supportive two years ago @entity14 's foreign minister , @entity32 , condemned suggestions the prince would be posted , saying : ‘ this only serves to once again highlight @entity20 's ongoing military presence in land and sea areas that are part of the @entity14 's national territories			1
’ @entity1 , referred to in the @entity7 as flight lieutenant @entity41 , has always made clear , however , he is keen to go			1
according to sources , the prince does not want to be singled out for any special treatment and the posting will , significantly , count towards his bid for promotion to captain			0
he is currently working as a @entity22 co-pilot			1
he has also discussed the issue with his wife , the @entity27 , as it will be the longest they have ever been apart			1
@entity27 , though , considers herself ‘ very much a military wife ’ and is said to have been ‘ overwhelmingly supportive ’ of his decision			1
for his part the prince is said to be looking forward to the posting			0
‘ he just wants to get on with his job , ’ a source said			0
the @entity62 was at pains to stress last night that this was very much a ‘ routine deployment ’ - although it will , conveniently , allow the prince to be back in the country well before the actual anniversary of @entity14 ’s invasion , on april 2 , and the @entity70 celebrations in june			2
a spokesman further insisted that the decision to send the prince , who will be one of a crew of four sent from @entity75 on @entity76 , @entity77 , was one taken solely by his @entity7 chain of command			0
in a statement the department said : ‘ the @entity7 can confirm that flight lieutenant ( flt lt ) @entity1 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity75 will complete a routine deployment to the @entity3 as part of a crew of four @entity7 personnel during the period february – march 2012			1
‘ this deployment forms part of a normal squadron crew rotation and will form part of @entity41 ’ training and career progression as a @entity7 pilot within the @entity7			2
’ victory : @entity20 soldiers fly the @entity97 flag over port @entity99 , @entity100 , on june 16 , 1982			2
simultaneously , another flies in the islands ' capital @entity105 , signifying the end of the @entity3 conflict in the family : prince @entity108 grins broadly at @entity105 in his capacity as a @entity22 pilot during the conflict			1
he opened @entity111 , where prince @entity1 will be based , in 1985 defeat : @entity14 prisoners of war amassed in @entity105 after their surrender to the @entity20 @entity115			1
prince @entity116 will be deployed there on the 30th anniversary of the war they also stressed that the prince would not be carrying out any royal duties while he was there			0
the spokesman added : ‘ flt lt @entity41 is one of 38,000 @entity7 personnel , all of whom are regularly and routinely deployed abroad			0
it is part of the job a six week deployment to the @entity3 is conventional for such pilots at this stage of their career			2
’ the @entity137 insisted it was simply co-incidence that the prince was being deployed during the 30th anniversary of the war			0
‘ it is a routine deployment and just so happens to fall in the 30th anniversary			2
it was not planned in any way			0
obviously we value our relationship with @entity14 and these things are taken into consideration but it is simply that the deployment rotation has fallen in this way , ’ a spokesman said			0
two @entity7 ( @entity151 ) crews are based in the @entity3 at any one time and pilots routinely deploy on a rolling basis as part of their training and career development			0
provocative : the @entity1 's deployment may be seen as antagonistic , but @entity159 says sovereignty of the islands is non-negotiable a @entity151 crew consists of two pilots , a winch / radar operator and a winchman			1
the team provides 24 - hour cover and support for @entity20 forces in the region as well as providing an extra rescue and life - saving facility for islanders and shipping in the area			0
@entity1 will travel to the @entity20 sovereignty 8,000 miles away in early february – just after his wife ’s 30th birthday – and return to the @entity20 in march			1
@entity111 , where he will be based , was opened in 1985 by the @entity108 , who was famously a @entity22 pilot in the 1982 war			1
@entity108 was based on invincible flying on missions that included anti-submarine warfare and casualty evacuation			0
he witnessed the @entity14 attack on the civilian container ship , @entity187 ’ and was one of the first to take off survivors			0
@entity111 , 30 miles south west of the islands ' capital , @entity105 , is home to up to 2,000 @entity20 military personnel			0
conditions are said to be ‘ bleak ’ and the base has been dubbed ‘ the death star ’ due to its confusing layout			1
the prince will have to take his own toilet roll and be prepared for plagues of mice and mites in his living quarters			0
his accommodation will be furnished with a simple single bed and shared bathroom facilities			0
@entity1 will be advised to take plenty of warm clothing as the islands can experience ‘ all four seasons in just one day ’ and shoes in good repair because there are no cobblers			1
the base does have a range of sporting activities to alleviate boredom , but the golf course in @entity105 has no greens and players need to negotiate a mine field			2
@entity223 normally arrives twice a week and the @entity27 will have to write ‘ blueys ’ , like other forces ’ wives .			2

@entity1 will fly out in *january* after *spending* @entity228 with the @entity27
longest time *newlyweds* would have been apart
@entity27 said to be very supportive of deployment
@entity1 will co-pilot @entity22 on rescue missions
conditions on island ' bleak ' but military base does have sporting facilities
