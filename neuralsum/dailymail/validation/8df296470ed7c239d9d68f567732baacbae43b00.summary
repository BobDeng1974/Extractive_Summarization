' we understand how difficult this has been for @entity6 and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life			1
' doctors said the chemotherapy would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival , but without it there was a near - certainty of death within two years			1

the lymphatic system is part of your immune system			0
@entity59 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes			2
lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes or glands			0
these lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection			2
the most common symptom of @entity9 is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin			0
it usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50			0
almost all young people with @entity9 will be fully cured			0
for older people over the age of 50 , the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent			0
treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids			2
several other states recognize the ' mature minor doctrine ' , but the court said she did not understand the severity of her condition			2
she will have to wait until she turns 18 in september before she can make her own medical decisions			2
@entity6 was diagnosed in september and after initial surgery failed , she was given two rounds of chemotherapy			1
she then asked for treatment to be stopped and , in order to avoid further trips to hospital , ran away from home			0
her mother @entity39 supported her choice but the @entity18 claimed custody of the girl and took the case to court			0
' it 's a question of fundamental constitutional rights -- the right to have a say over what happens to your body -- and the right to say to the government ' you ca n't control what happens to my body , ' @entity6 's mother 's attorney , @entity117 , told @entity132			1
her mother told @entity134 that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want ' poison ' in her body			0
' she has always — even years ago — said that if she was diagnosed with cancer , she would not put poison into her body , ' ms @entity6 explained			1
she was then returned to @entity12 to start chemotherapy			1
' @entity12 reported to the @entity18 that i was not giving medical attention to my daughter , ' said ms @entity6			1

' it 's disgusting that i 'm fighting for a right that i and anyone in my situation should already have			0
' this is my life and my body , not @entity18 's and not the state 's			1
i am a human — i should be able to decide if i do or do n't want chemotherapy			0
' whether i live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone 's choice but mine			2
' she added : ' i believe there 's a natural way or at least an alternative to chemo out there that i am willing to look for and explore			0
