by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 11:08 est , 5 november 2012 parish councillors have pulled the plug on a @entity4 lights switch on ceremony in a decision described as ‘ health and safety gone berserk ’			1
the event , which usually attracts several hundred people every year , was axed by councillors in @entity12 , @entity13 who feared the village green would become overcrowded			1
instead , the lights will be quietly switched without fanfare			2
@entity4 is cancelled : the @entity4 lights switch - on at @entity12 last year			1
the event usually attracts several hundred people but has been cancelled this year over health and safety fears @entity21 , vice-president of the @entity22 , said the decision was ‘ health and safety gone berserk ’			1
he said : ‘ we ’re talking about responsible adults bringing children to a community event and nothing more than that			1
i think it ’s a perfect location			0
this year the switch on has been cancelled , the lights will be turned on quietly without fanfare			1
pictured is last year 's switch on			2
‘ in terms of space , we ’ve looked at it and we think there ’s more than enough room for everybody to come and have a great time			2
‘ there is nowhere else to go now			0
the parish council has really let the community down			1
’ in previous years , the ceremony has been held in a local supermarket car park with @entity50 ’s grotto inside the community centre but this year the @entity52 withdrew permission for the use of the centre because organisers failed to ‘ sign in ’ everyone who entered the building			1
to resolve the issue , the chamber , which has organised the switch on for the last 11 years , suggested the event be held on the village green			1
but the parish council blocked those plans on health and safety grounds			0
chair of the parish council , @entity68 said : ‘ the plans we voted against were using our little green area			0
the key reason for that is it ’s quite a small area and normally we get hundreds to the light switch on			0
‘ i think the problem is that they approached us with about four weeks to go and essentially held a gun to our head and said “ either you let us use the green or it wo n’t happen ”			0
‘ we just ca n’t see how they could fit it on that particular piece of land			0
‘ we ’re in favour of the lights			0
we ’re just not in favour of holding it on the parish green			0
’ previous fun of the fair : crowds in the town are kept entertained but there will be no similar scenes this year after they feared too many people would turn up to the village green @entity21 from the chamber of commerce said it was ' responsible adults bringing children to a community event and nothing more than that ' concerns were also raised about event licences , the lack of stewards , the weight of the fairground roundabout , notices for road closures , adequate risk assessment and insurance to parish council property			1
mr @entity68 said of the plans : ‘ we are concerned as we have dry - stone walls , a fountain and a rockery and an adjacent main road			0
our concern is that it is just totally unsafe and unsuitable			0
‘ as far as i know the christmas lights committee has not scheduled another place to hold the switch - on			2
’ the @entity4 lights , which cost £ 3,000 to install and maintain , were due to be lit on november 24 but they are now likely to be switched on without an official event			1
mr @entity21 said : ‘ if the parish council does n’t want to co-operate , then we will just turn the lights on without the event			1
‘ the council is supposed to be working with the community , not having all this in - fighting			2
‘ they have also given us nothing in terms of cash			0
‘ it ’s truly a highlight of the year in the village - it ’s a delightful event			0
‘ it ’s all about the community , it ’s all about the children and for those children who come , it ’s absolutely wonderful and marks the start of @entity4			1
’ health and safety guidelines for public events state that organisers need to have crowd management , planning for emergencies and event stewards			0
village highlight : the ceremony is a special time of year for @entity12 when the lights , which cost £ 3,000 to install and maintain , are switched on in november			2

the @entity52 *refused* permission for the annual @entity4 lights switch on ceremony
they worry there is not enough room for the several hundred people the event attracts
the @entity22 says the council has ' let the community down '
