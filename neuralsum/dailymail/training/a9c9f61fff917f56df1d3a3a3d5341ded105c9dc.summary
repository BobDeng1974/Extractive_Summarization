by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 11:33 est , 13 april 2013 a young mother suffered a massive stroke after she was wrongly sent home from hospital because there were no specialists on duty over the weekend to assess a brain scan			1
@entity9 was aged just 30 when she was admitted to hospital after suffering two mini-strokes over 48 hours			1
doctors carried out two brain scans , but failed to give her a diagnosis because it was a friday evening and the specialist neurologist was not on site			1
before : @entity9 on her wedding day to @entity19 before she suffered a stroke aged 30 after : mrs @entity9 , from @entity21 , following her stroke			1
now 36 , her husband says she is still learning to speak again after being left permanently brain damaged			2
the stroke could have been prevented by an aspirin instead they sent the mother - of - two home without treatment and that night she suffered a massive stroke in bed			1
her husband , @entity19 , 47 , discovered his wife , who worked in a building society , slumped on the floor of their bedroom , unable to speak or move			2
mrs @entity9 , whose two children @entity39 and @entity41 were aged just five and one when the stroke occurred , suffered permanent brain damage			1
she was unable to speak and is still learning to read and write again			0
she also has short - term memory problems , suffers from depression and is unlikely to ever work again			0
last month ( march ) the couple were awarded a six - figure sum in damages following a seven year fight for justice			1
but mr @entity51 , an executive chef , said that no amount of money could compensate for how his family life had been irrevocably damaged by the blunder			2
mr @entity51 said : ‘ @entity9 changed overnight from a happy , vibrant , independent woman to a shadow of her former self and our family life will never be the same again			1
happier times : mrs @entity9 was a ' bubbly , vibrant character ' , before she was struck down by her stroke , according to @entity19 ‘ the stroke destroyed @entity9 , she is a former grade a student but now everything is a struggle			1
she has had to learn to speak again and still has difficulty talking			0
she ca n’t sit and read the children stories , or help them with their homework and our seven - year - old daughter is teaching her how to read and write			1
‘ despite this , she can understand everything that ’s going on , which is very frustrating for her			0
she suffers from depression and has talked numerous times of not wanting to be here anymore			0
’ mrs @entity9 , a keen horse rider who visited the gym several times a week , suffered the first mini-stroke while visiting her mother , @entity82 , 61,on november 15 2006			2
while waiting for a blood test at her @entity85 surgery the following day she suffered another small stroke and the decision was made to go straight to @entity88			2
she was admitted and underwent a ct scan , then an @entity89 scan the following day			0
however , medics failed to make a diagnosis and instead said they wanted a specialist neurologist , who was not at the hospital , to take a look at the scans			0
because it was a friday evening the specialist was n’t available and , although the scans showed signs of abnormality , medics made the decision to discharge mrs @entity9 , who was told to wait for an out patient ’s appointment , instead			1
she returned home and went to bed but suffered the stroke in the middle of the night			2
a medical expert provided evidence to the couple ’s solicitor that prescribing a simple dose of aspirin for mrs @entity9 , now 36 , would have prevented it occurring			1
mr @entity51 , of @entity21 , @entity118 , added : ‘ if the hospital had given @entity9 aspirin and monitored her effectively the stroke would have been avoided			1
‘ the sad truth is if @entity9 had suffered her mini-strokes on a monday she would probably had better care because there would have been more doctors and more specialists on duty			1
‘ unfortunately , @entity9 was sent home on a friday night because the doctors knew nothing could be done over the weekend			0
‘ we put our trust in those doctors and unfortunately they let @entity9 down			0
@entity133 has agreed to pay the family a six - figure compensation package after a seven - year battle ‘ instructing solicitors was never about getting compensation , it was about getting some answers for @entity9			1
as it turns out we now know that someone did n’t do enough for her , which does n’t make it any better or give her any closure			0
’ tests later revealed mrs @entity9 was suffering from @entity148 's arteritis , a rare disease caused by the inflammation of the walls of the largest arteries in the body , which makes sufferers more susceptible to strokes			0
she has been treated with aspirin on an on - going basis and has not suffered another stroke since			2
dr @entity159 , a consultant physician , provided evidence on mrs @entity9 ’s care for her legal case			0
he said : ‘ there was a failure to recognise the signs of stroke and to appreciate the initial scan findings			0
mrs @entity9 was initially discharged without any treatment and it is likely aspirin would have been beneficial			0
’ @entity171 , a medical negligence lawyer at @entity172 , who represented mrs @entity9 , said : ‘ this is an absolutely tragic case of a young woman with a loving family who has been struck down in her prime			0
‘ the quality of care provided to sufferers can mean the difference between a full recovery and permanent disability , so it is absolutely vital that the @entity185 is making sure its healthcare staff are able to provide fast diagnosis and treatment			0
’ a spokesman for @entity88 said the hospital was ‘ pleased ’ a settlement had been reached with mrs @entity9 , but added : ‘ @entity192 has made no admission of liability			2

@entity9 , of @entity21 , @entity118 , left struggling to speak and look after her children
sent away from @entity88 despite suffering two mini-strokes
it was a friday evening so no neurologist was on duty
hours later she suffered huge stroke in bed , causing brain damage
simple aspirin *prescription* could have prevented the tragedy
@entity133 agrees to pay six - figure sum in compensation for now 36 - year - old
@entity19 , 47 , says family life will never be the same again
