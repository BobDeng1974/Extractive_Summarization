the third - in - line - to - the - throne was sporting a checked shirt open at the neck to display an @entity42 leather thong - style necklace , jeans , suede desert boots and a baseball cap			0
his girlfriend , pretty upper - class dance student @entity27 , who at 24 is four years younger than the prince , was even more dressed down in slouchy ‘ boyfriend ’ jeans - so called because they look like they could have been borrowed from your partner			1
her oversized grey wool jumper appeared to have been pinched from @entity6 as well , the sleeves hanging loosely over her wrists , while on her feet were hi - top white trainers			2
it certainly was n’t the kind of outfit you would expect even an off - duty @entity63 of @entity64 to be seen in			0

true gentleman : the 28 year old royal stepped in as a knight in shining armour and helped his lady in distress with her bag on the lookout : prince @entity6 looks over his shoulder as his girlfriend gets in the car alighting on the platform , the couple peeled off from the rest of the group and headed , accompanied by two @entity14 bodyguards , towards a waiting @entity15 driven by another member of the security team			1
ever the gentleman , @entity6 helped @entity27 to load her bag into the waiting car before they hopped in together and headed off the in the direction of @entity17 , where the prince has an apartment			2
well - placed sources say the prince , who has just completed a stint in @entity171 as an @entity173 helicopter pilot and is continuing his training with the @entity175 , said he seems ‘ incredibly keen ’ on @entity27 , with whom he was seen smooching on the slopes of @entity179 ski resort earlier this year			0
