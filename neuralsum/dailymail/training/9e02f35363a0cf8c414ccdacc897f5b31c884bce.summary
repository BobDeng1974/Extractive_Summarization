@entity0 was celebrating the perfect @entity2 homecoming last night - and then revealed that the first person to congratulate him after @entity5 ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity6 was @entity7			1
@entity0 walked out on @entity8 just days before returning to @entity5 so was delighted to pick up @entity7 ’s message minutes after the final whistle			1
‘ when i checked my phone after the game the first person who texted me was @entity7 and i appreciated that , ’ he added			1
‘ he knew that probably it was the right time for everybody concerned			2
@entity0 clenches his fist in celebration after @entity5 's 2 - 1 win over @entity6 @entity0 celebrates with his backroom staff during @entity5 's victory over @entity6 @entity7 was the first person to congratulate him after the win , according to @entity0 ‘ he just said it was a great result and i appreciated that			1
’ @entity0 soaked up the applause from a thrilled home crowd who had seen @entity5 bounce back from a @entity28 opener to win courtsy of a @entity31 penalty and @entity32			1
but @entity0 reckoned the masterstroke was the half - time introduction of @entity36 to stifle the life out of @entity6 ’s midfield and late arrival of @entity40 off the bench to run the visitors ragged			1
‘ i just felt we needed more maverick behaviour in the team and that was the reason for the sub at half time and then @entity50 came on and gave us the exact reaction i was looking for , ” @entity0 said after the 2 - 1 win			1
' i left him out to see what his reaction would be			2
this is a boy whose confidence i think really has to be rekindled and today will do him no harm , those 20 minutes were electrifying			2
‘ i do n't know muich about @entity36 but he was the difference			2
@entity61 was getting too much time on the ball and he stopped him playing			0
' in the end it was our discipline that saw us home			0
we had all the attributes of a great victory and an eventful 90 minutes that has worked out really well for us			0
i am glad it ended how it did with us having a few more chances			0
' @entity31 shoots to score his penalty against @entity6 on saturday evening for @entity5 @entity32 was able to make it 2 - 1 in the final 10 minutes against @entity6 to give @entity5 the win @entity0 has swapped relentless derision and criticism from @entity8 fans at @entity77 for the unwavering support of the @entity2 crowd and he harnessed their voices by rousing their cheers in the final minutes as @entity5 worked hard to complete the triumph			1
but the former @entity5 player knows how quickly things in football can change and how fickle football fans can be so he ’s refusing to get carried away with a tough trip to fellow relegation fighters @entity89 next weekend			2
' football has highs and lows , ' he said			0
' @entity6 put one of the performances of the season in against @entity96 last week and then come here and get beaten by @entity5			1
' it will be the same for us if we lose to @entity89 , it changes quickly and keep your feet on the floor			0
it is not straight lines in this game and turning up on time and eating the right food			0
it is about having a bit of maverick about you somewhere and this team needs a bit of that and today we found it just in time			0
' we have a few but it can be withdrawn and i think you can get a bit negative with bad results and your maverick players start playing a bit sensible			0
you have to get the balance right and second half we did			0
