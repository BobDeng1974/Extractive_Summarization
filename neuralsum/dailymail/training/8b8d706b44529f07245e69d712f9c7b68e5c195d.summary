click here to view all the stats and graphics from @entity4 's win against @entity5 using our fantastic match zone service given his age and experience , @entity8 was the last man you expected to hit the self - destruct button and cost @entity5 a pulsating cup - tie			1
@entity8 's arrival from the bench had helped inspire a @entity5 fightback after they trailed 2 - 0 at the interval , even though @entity4 manager @entity19 noted ruefully ' it was not the way i like to play football '			1
but having done the hard work and with @entity5 back on level terms , the 33 - year - old former @entity26 striker inexplicably lunged first at @entity28 and then @entity29 to pick up two yellow cards in 80 seconds and leave @entity5 a man short for the remaining couple of minutes			2
@entity4 striker striker @entity32 fired his side ahead with an 25 - yard drive against @entity5 @entity5 keeper @entity35 was helpless as @entity32 's strike curled inside his left - hand post @entity4 striker @entity32 continued his scoring streak against @entity5 on wednesday night @entity5 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity35 5.5 ; @entity39 5.5 , @entity40 6 , @entity41 6 , @entity42 6 ; @entity43 5.5 ( @entity44 73 6 ) , @entity45 5.5 ; @entity46 5.5 , @entity47 5 ( @entity8 73 6 ) , @entity48 5 ; @entity49 6 unused subs : @entity52 ( @entity51 ) , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 booked : @entity39 , @entity41 , @entity44 , @entity8 sent off : @entity8 @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity57 6 ; @entity58 6 , @entity59 6 ( @entity60 90 ) , @entity28 6 , @entity61 6.5 ; @entity62 6 , @entity63 7.5 ( @entity64 90 ) , @entity65 7 ; long 6.5 , @entity32 6.5 , @entity66 6.5 unused subs : @entity68 ( @entity51 ) , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ; @entity32 , @entity28 @entity73 man : @entity29 referee : @entity75 6.5 attendance : 16,340 that was all @entity4 needed			1
@entity29 floated in a free - kick and without @entity8 's 6ft 6ins presence there was panic in the @entity5 ranks			1
the ball bounced off the waist of @entity42 and @entity32 smashed the ball into the roof of the net for his second goal of the night and ninth of the season			2
' @entity8 went high with his second challenge so there is always that risk when you are already on a yellow , ' acknowledged @entity5 manager @entity96			1
' it shows the emotion of a cup tie can get to even the most experienced players			0
some of the wind went out of our sails			0
we did n't deal with the next ball into our own box and it fell to the last man we 'd want			0
' @entity4 , riding high in the @entity108 , now have a winnable quarter - final at @entity111 @entity110 and @entity19 , who won @entity113 and the @entity114 as a player , is dreaming of leading the club to their first major trophy since winning the @entity118 in 1976			2
' we were much the better team on the pitch tonight , ' he said			0
' it was real cup football and @entity5 made it a real battle when they brought @entity8 on			1
it is one of their qualities			0
we do n't have @entity130 football and this is the chance of a title			0
' @entity5 have had a bad fortnight with issues over grappling , diving and @entity47 allegedly throwing his boots in the dressing - room			2
@entity47 was given only his third start but @entity5 started sluggishly and fell behind after six minutes when @entity32 was given time and space to curl a 25 - yard shot beyond @entity35			1
worse was to follow for the home side			0
@entity29 appeared close to the @entity5 by - line and as he cut the ball back , three @entity5 players inexplicably retreated into their own six - yard box while @entity145 fired home unmarked from eight			1
it was @entity145 's first @entity4 goal since his £ 12million move to @entity150 , whom he faces at the weekend			1
@entity5 were booed off at half - time with @entity96 admitting ' we lacked the intensity needed ' but they threw themselves a lifeline three minutes after the restart when @entity45 took advantage of a retreating @entity4 defence to shoot in from 18 yards			1
the visitors had chances to wrap the game up with @entity164 having a shot blocked by @entity40 and @entity145 volleying over from @entity66 's glorious pass			2
but when @entity96 reverted to ' old @entity5 ' with 17 minutes left and sent on the cavalry in the form of @entity8 and @entity44 – @entity47 one of the players to make way – and the comeback looked on			2
@entity145 doubled @entity4 's lead with a clinical strike in the 30th minute at the @entity175 @entity5 keeper @entity35 is beaten by a shot from @entity145 ( left ) of @entity4 midfielder @entity45 gave @entity5 a lifeline with a goal three minutes after the interval striker @entity49 ( centre ) scores @entity5 's second goal in the 82nd minute against @entity4 substitute @entity8 was shown a red card by referee @entity75 for a second bookable offence it was n't exactly pretty			1
@entity44 's first act was to exact retribution on @entity4 midfielder @entity62 who had hurt @entity46 in the first half			2
the @entity187 caught @entity62 on the back of the leg with a raking stud and the mild - mannered @entity19 jumped up to protest			0
' i said to the fourth referee that in my opinion it was a red card			0
he had no intention to play the ball			0
it was from behind , ' he said			0
but @entity44 escaped with a yellow and supplied the 84th minute corner from which @entity49 headed @entity5 's equaliser			1
ironically , @entity40 had a part to play by gently nudging @entity59 out the way			0
from 2 - 2 , @entity5 should have completed a rousing victory			0
instead , @entity8 behaved idiotically and @entity96 , who won the @entity206 as a player with @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 , wo n't be getting his hands on the trophy this year			0
@entity5 striker @entity49 attempts an overhead kick in front of @entity4 's @entity28 @entity32 scores his second goal of the game and ninth of the season to secure place in the last eight @entity32 celebrates his dramatic late winner with @entity4 fans on wednesday night @entity32 received a yellow card for jumping over the advertising hoardings after scoring the winning goal			1
