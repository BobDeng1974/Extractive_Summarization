by @entity0 a council crippled by cuts has paid out nearly £ 1million in health and safety claims to teachers , pupils and school visitors in just five years			1
one teacher was given £ 113,905 after they were hurt breaking up a playground brawl , while a school caretaker got £ 40,000 after trapping his thumb in a window , and a dinner lady was paid £ 1,500 for injuries caused by a ' defective saucepan lid '			1
@entity17 , which is to axe 1,000 jobs to help it save £ 822million by 2018 , refused to answer questions about the circumstances in which the employee who was given the six - figure sum of public money was injured during the playground fight			1
but the @entity26 - run council was criticised today for spending an ' extraordinary sum ' on claims described as ' frivolous by any stretch of the imagination '			1
@entity17 , which must save £ 822million , spent nearly £ 1m on school health and safety payouts other examples of the council 's payouts include £ 1,750 to a cleaner who was hurt by ' a defective mop ' , £ 34,539 to a worker who tripped in a store cupboard , and £ 5,513 to a child who fell over in a sandpit			1
meanwhile a student who was hit in the face by a ball received £ 18,316 , a pupil who suffered a chemical burn to their hand in a science lesson received £ 17,250 , and another who suffered ' debility contracted during a camping trip ' was paid £ 19,288			2
the figures , released under the @entity56 , show that council employees received £ 546,753 in compensation , while compensation and costs claims by pupils and visitors amounted to £ 364,775 between 2009 - 2014			2
today campaigners said the claims , which totalled £ 911,538 , were an example of @entity68 's ' out of control ' compensation culture			1
@entity69 , chief executive of the @entity70 said : ' an extraordinary sum of taxpayers ' money has been paid out in playground compensation claims , some of which appear frivolous by any stretch of the imagination			0
' legal fees on top of this will only add to the bill landing on residents ' doorsteps			0
' this is further evidence of a compensation culture out of control that councils and ministers must do a better job of counteracting			0
' there to learn : but vast sums have been paid out for accidents at schools in @entity95 ( file picture ) one deputy headteacher , who works at a state school in @entity95 but did not wish to be named , added : ' schools feel like they are treading on eggshells with children and staff these days			0
' we are living in a blame culture , and thousands of pounds are being spent on settling these sort of claims rather than being invested in children 's education			0
' ' thousands of pounds are being spent on settling these sort of claims rather than being invested in children 's education ' @entity111 teacher a spokesman for @entity17 said that health and safety of pupils and staff was ' a paramount consideration ' but admitted there was ' always room for improvements '			1
' when accidents do occur , appropriate reviews are undertaken , safety policy is revised as required and lessons learned to ensure we continue to maintain high standards of safety ' , the spokesman said			0
@entity129 , general secretary of teaching union @entity130 , said : ' it is a myth that compensation is easy to obtain ; in reality , the hurdles and barriers facing claimants are extremely high			0
' while compensation is important , it can never make up for the fact that many of these teachers suffer permanent physical and mental injury and often can not continue in their chosen career			0
