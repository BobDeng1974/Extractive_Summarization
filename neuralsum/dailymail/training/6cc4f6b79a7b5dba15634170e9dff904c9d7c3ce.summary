@entity5 , 67 , recently claimed ownership of the trend in an interview with the @entity9 , showing off his more than 150 photographs with the likes of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 that he calls ' silly shots ' ' everybody 's making a big fuss about selfies — selfie this , selfie that … give me a break			1
i 've been doing selfies since 1981 , ' he told the @entity9			1
' i thought i better do something or else i 'll end up as roadkill on the history highway			0
that job led to several others in the area and eventually he moved to @entity38 for more work in 1979			0
it was in @entity2 that he started working on shows like ' @entity43 ' and ' @entity42 ' where he began to rub shoulders with the movers and shakers in the entertainment industry			1
stepping forward : @entity5 decided to claim credit for the celebrity selfie so as not to become ' roadkill on the history highway '			1
pictured above with actor @entity53 working man : @entity5 met most of his subjects while working as a cameraman in @entity2			1
pictured above with athlete @entity14 successful : @entity5 was only ever denied a picture once , by @entity59 actress @entity58			1
pictured above with actress @entity12 his first selfie was taken in 1981 with humorist @entity61 and shot on a traditional film camera			0
@entity5 went on to take about 150 selfies with celebrities , and credits his success with first chatting up the stars he was introduced to on set			1
he says he was only turned down once , by @entity59 actress @entity58 , who would only agree to the picture if someone else took the shot			0
' i awkwardly withdrew , ' @entity5 recalls			1
legend : for more than two decades , @entity73 took pictures of himself with some 150 celebrities such as @entity12 and @entity14 since selfies require the the subject and cameraman to join close , @entity5 says the resulting photographs are more intimate and put the celebrities ' in a whole different mood '			1
in many of the shots , the celebrities wrap their arms around @entity86 as if he 's a close friend			0
and the shots have made for quite a few good stories			0
when he approached @entity90 for a snap , the famous director cautioned him about his angle			2
' are you sure you want to take it that way ? ' @entity93 asked			0
' you may not get another chance			0

pictured above with actress @entity105 @entity5 takes a snap with legendary actor @entity107 @entity108 : @entity5 pictured with a younger @entity109 but the picture came out fine , just like his shot with president @entity13 , once he was out of office			2
that shot was more difficult to take since @entity5 had to make his way past @entity116			2
there are also some awkward memories , like the time he approached @entity119 who thought he was ' macking ' on his girlfriend , something @entity5 denies			2
@entity5 explained why he continued to document his run - ins with the rich and famous , saying it was a way to document his life after leaving his hometown			2
' i came from @entity127 , ' he said			0
' people in @entity127 really do n't get out and about into the celebrity scene much			0
