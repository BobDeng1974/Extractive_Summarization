with an increasing number of families and unaccompanied children pouring across the border , it has become one of @entity7 's most pressing issues			0
now , a survey has revealed the town which plays host to the most immigrants in every @entity13 state			1
the research , based on figures from the @entity16 , shows that a staggering 74 per cent of the locals in @entity18 , @entity19 , were born in another country			1
in @entity40 , a fewer 47.1 per cent of locals in @entity39 are foreign - born - the highest number in the state			1
but at the other end of the spectrum , only 4.7 per cent of people in @entity44 , @entity45 , are immigrants			2
the research , carried out by @entity50 , looked at towns , cities and villages with at least 1,000 - strong populations using estimates from the 2008 - 2012 @entity56			2
fewer : in @entity40 , 47.1 per cent of locals in @entity39 ( pictured ) are foreign - born - the highest in the state but at the other end of the spectrum , only 4.7 per cent of people in @entity44 ( pictured ) , @entity45 , are immigrants unsurprisingly , @entity7 was found to be the most common birthplace among immigrants			1
it comes just days after it emerged that president @entity63 is on pace to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007			0
according to an analysis of @entity69 figures by @entity70 , the federal agency responsible for deportations sent home 258,608 immigrants between the start of the budget year last october and july 28 this summer			0
during the same period a year earlier , it removed 320,167 people â€” meaning this year saw a decrease in deportations by nearly 20 percent			0
reduced numbers : it comes just days after it emerged that president @entity63 ( pictured ) is on pace to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007 the figures , contained in weekly internal reports marked ' @entity85 only , ' reflect the marked decline in deportations , while mr @entity63 has delayed announcing what changes he will make to @entity13 immigration policies through executive action			1
the president said he would act before the end of the summer , but @entity93 officials said last weekend that he would postpone his decision until after november 's elections			0
the announcement came much to the chagrin of @entity99 leaders ; many of whom believe mr @entity63 's deported too many immigrants since taking office , mr @entity63 's administration has removed more than 2.1 million immigrants from the country			0
