she ’s the business mogul who transformed @entity2 from a cobbler in @entity4 to a multimillion pound global brand adored by @entity7 celebrities			1
you ’re no one unless you ’ve a pair of ‘ @entity10 , ’ and the shoe empire would be nothing without @entity13			1
but with the designer name behind her and an own - brand collection going strong , @entity13 says she ’s the happiest she has ever been , and credits much of it to her daughter @entity18 , 12			1
like mother , like daughter : @entity13 , right , and @entity21 , left , at a film premiere in june			1
@entity13 says her daughter loves fashion and has great style businesswoman : @entity13 pictured in @entity27 last year			1
the @entity29 - born designer and mogul is credited for making @entity2 a household name and multimillion pound brand @entity13 , 46 , who was awarded an obe in 2010 for her services to the fashion industry , has been open about her very public battles with her mother ( the two are still not on speaking terms ) and her acrimonious spilt from @entity2 - the brand she built with the designer – in 2007			1
in her memoir , in her shoes , published last september , @entity13 said of her daughter , known as @entity45 ; ‘ i was in a very dark and dangerous place and i ’m sure the only thing that saved me was @entity45			1
’ and now , as the book is re-released in a paperback version , @entity13 reveals the business and life lessons she will pass onto to her daughter			1
and despite not even reaching her teenage years yet , @entity52 is wasting no time learning the ropes so that she can one day follow in her mother ’s own fabulous footsteps			2
‘ she travels everywhere with me and sits in on all my meetings , ’ @entity13 tells @entity56			1
‘ she ’s learning about what i do from osmosis , from actually doing it			2
and i think that ’s the best education			0
it ’s giving her confidence and experience			0
if she has an idea , she contributes			0
’ @entity13 lives with her daughter in @entity68 , where her business , @entity13 , is based – ‘ a gorgeous little office on @entity72 next to @entity73 , ’ @entity13 gushes about her workspace			1
in her shoes : @entity13 , pictured , says her daughter @entity18 sits in on all her meetings			1
' she 's learning about what i do from osmosis , from actually doing it , ' she says fancy footwear : @entity2 shoes , the brand that @entity13 built from little and is most known for motherly love : @entity13 with her young daughter @entity18 at film premieres in 2004 , @entity86 , and 2005 born in @entity27 in 1967 , @entity13 was raised between @entity87 and @entity88 , attending two @entity29 boarding schools and a finishing school in @entity91			1
travelling in the world is as much in her blood as fashion			2
she continues : ‘ my daughter and i bond over the business and decided , together , she ’s going to travel with me and be in on my meetings			2
‘ it ’s such a great way for us to bond			0
i love having her with me , i hate leaving her behind			0
’ whether @entity45 will take over the reigns from her mother one day is still to be decided , however			0
‘ it ’s a little early still , ’ laughs @entity13			1
‘ but she loves fashion			1
she ’s got strong opinions , which i like			0
' it ’s very good , though i do n’t get a say in what she wears			0
unless she asks for my advice , i stay out of it ! memoir : in my shoes by @entity13 is released in paperback on thursday ‘ if there was a stage that she was wearing really inappropriate clothing then i would put my foot down , thankfully we have n’t hit that bridge yet ! ’ @entity13 became accessories editor at @entity123 in her early 20s before decamping to set up the @entity2 label			1
by the @entity126 , it had become stratospheric ; @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 were just a handful of the early @entity7 supporters			0
it became a household name after @entity135 wore the shoes in @entity137 , and over the course of the series , the brand was mentioned 34 times			2
by the end of 2000 , @entity2 was turning a profit of around £ 3m a year			1
there was a @entity27 boutique and the brand was represented at 450 more stores , including @entity148 and @entity149			0
the relationship between @entity13 and @entity2 , however , was strained - and got worse over the years			1
once the business had been sold off to various equity companies , @entity13 found the brand she grew from little , was being stretched and moulded into one she could n’t recognise			1
' my huge regret was knowing that all the women at @entity2 were underpaid			2
and not fighting more for that			0
‘ that ’s when my involvement in @entity2 started to dissolve , as it was turning into something i did n’t want it to be			2
i did n’t like the direction it was going in			0
’ going out on her own , after finally leaving @entity2 for good in 2011 , was one of the hardest , bravest and most rewarding things @entity13 says she has ever done			1
‘ i had the decision : do i leave now and start again and risk it , or stay , make a ton more money and be very safe but not be doing the work i am proud of and see my management team treated unfairly ? ' she says			0
‘ i just could n’t do that			0
it ’s about the people and team , not just making money			0
‘ that ethos developed over time , certainly when i had my daughter and as i was growing the business and dealing with financial difficulties and private equity people			2
‘ i wanted to motivate and empower women as i went on			0
i wanted to create a different culture and build a business that really supports women and i want @entity45 to go into a work environment like that one day , whatever she decides to do			0
' whilst @entity13 is still in its ' early stages , ' says @entity13 , she has big plans			2
she says : ' my team have to hold the reigns on me ! i have visions for fragrance and makeup and homewear and swimwear and have moodboards on every product category you can imagine			0
' we ’re still building the core business but when i feel that it ’s ready i ca n’t wait to expand			0
' she adds : ‘ when i left @entity2 , i thought it would be very distressing and i ’d morn it for a long time			2
‘ but once my focus was on creating something else , it ’s amazing how quickly we move on – so much faster than i thought i would			0
‘ @entity2 is another life it feels so distant			2
new focus , and once i ’m focused on creating something else , if i ’m creating a product then i ’m really happy			0
