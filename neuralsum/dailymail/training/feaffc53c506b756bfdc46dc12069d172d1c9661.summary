i spent the @entity2 in the same @entity4 hotel as @entity5 and some of his backroom staff and , in conversations with him , it was clear he was going from @entity8 straight into managing @entity9 without a break			1
i thought at the time that leaving behind a highly pressurised @entity2 and immediately taking over at one of the biggest clubs in the world would be quite difficult to handle			0
ideally , you would want to begin such a demanding job feeling refreshed after a break			0
since then , with a staggering number of injuries to cope with , life just has n’t got any easier for @entity20			1
and this means results in the opening third of the season were below par and almost certainly failed to meet his expectations			1
the first half - hour at @entity45 last month was as bad as i ’ve ever seen them play ; worse than their performances under @entity50 last season			1
i was travelling for the rest of the game and i was unable to see it live so i was stunned when i heard they had won			0
but if you can describe the position they are now in as par for the course — and up until this point they were definitely a few shots over — i would say that they still have some tough holes ahead and are capable of dropping some shots			0
the problem for @entity9 is no matter how formidable the attacking threat , everyone feels that they have a chance against them because of their defensive weakness			1
certainly @entity29 will on monday			0
@entity74 ’s team are not just ahead of @entity9 in the league — they are ahead of them in terms of knowing what their first - choice xi is , what their tactics are and how they are going to approach the game			1
they , too , had an extremely difficult summer but they have settled into their new identity much quicker than @entity9			1
@entity9 players celebrate beating @entity45 , despite one of their worst performances of the season @entity9 have suffered a succession of injuries this campaign , with record signing @entity93 currently out while @entity9 have struggled , @entity29 have exceeded expectations under @entity74 there is a growing assumption that @entity9 will now make the top four , which probably was the key target for the club after dipping to seventh place last season , an unprecedented low in the modern era			1
my feeling is that it will still be very much nip and tuck for them at the end of this campaign ; that they may well make the cut but they will just squeeze over the line rather than make it comfortably			0
in defence of @entity20 , you have to allow for the extraordinary injury list with which he has had to cope			1
at different times he has lost @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 for significant periods			0
even if he had his first - choice back four , we all would have pointed to the defence as a potential weakness			0
being denied his best players and with constant chopping and changing , it is hardly surprising they have struggled in that area			0
@entity130 has had a really good start to the season but the reality is he has been overworked for a @entity9 goalkeeper			1
the side really should not be relying on him to keep them in games			0
although @entity9 have been scoring goals , they have struggled with a constantly changing rearguard keeper @entity130 has been arguably @entity9 's best player with a string of match - saving displays the @entity144 have been linked with another big money spending spree to turn them back into champions i see now there are reports they plan to spend another £ 100 million in the transfer market			1
if they are to , then you would imagine that @entity20 ’s first priority would be to solidify the defence			0
@entity156 has been mentioned but for me he is ball - playing centre - half			2
i really like him , but i ’m not sure that he is the player @entity9 really need			2
for me , they require a stopper in the mould of @entity161 ; someone whose first priority is to defend			0
@entity166 ’s @entity165 , another name mentioned , is more suited to that role			2
if you wanted to look at the positives for @entity9 , they have at least rediscovered some of their panache compared with last season			1
when they are in full flow , they are a joy to watch			0
@entity176 is firing , @entity177 showed signs last weekend of getting his form back and @entity93 has been superb and they will miss him while he is injured			0
@entity177 has started to show the sort of form that brought @entity9 the title in his debut season @entity176 has responded to being handed the captaincy with some consistent performances @entity187 is the third member of @entity9 's new @entity188 , but doubts remain over his fitness if @entity187 can show some fitness , with @entity192 and @entity193 to add , @entity194 showing some form and @entity196 some promise , then they are back to what you imagine a @entity9 side to be , with attacking football at its core			1
yet despite that club tradition , @entity9 have always built on a strong defensive foundation , too			1
@entity205 and @entity206 , @entity161 and @entity207 are as much a part of @entity9 ’s folklore as their great attacking players			2
until @entity20 can rebuild a defensive force like that , @entity9 will struggle to challenge for the @entity40 title			1
and if he can not put things right quickly this season , then the top four could still be beyond them			0
@entity9 have not successfully managed to replace @entity207 ( left ) and @entity161 at the back @entity9 should be looking to bring in world class defenders like @entity156 ( left ) and @entity165 ( right ) @entity220 handling of @entity221 is spot on when i saw @entity221 had been left out last weekend by @entity223 , i thought it was great management			1
some people would say he was dropped ; i would say he was rested			0
when you leave out a player such as @entity221 , it ’s always going to create a great fuss but the reality is that he has to manage his games these days			2
and there ’s another point that has n’t been considered			0
@entity235 have lost @entity236 to @entity237 , @entity238 to injury and @entity240 has n’t worked out			0
so @entity223 needs to find another attacking threat from somewhere			2
@entity235 captain @entity221 has been rested by @entity223 in recent weeks @entity223 has made the right call in resting @entity221 , especially before @entity235 's midweek clash with @entity244 that means he needs to get @entity221 playing further forward again and , if he ’s going to get in and around the box , as he has been doing in recent games , he ’ll need even more energy than before			1
playing the holding role is a doddle by comparison — you can play there until you ’re 40 ! that ’s why choosing his games during this busy time is vital and i would imagine the manager and the captain would have planned when and where he plays			0
he ’ll definitely be needed for what promises to be a dramatic night on tuesday against @entity264 , when @entity223 ’ decision to rest @entity221 and others against @entity267 may be vindicated if @entity235 qualify			1
and with games against @entity9 and @entity45 in the next two weeks followed by the @entity270 period , @entity223 needs a fit and fresh @entity221 to get him some goals			1
the failure of @entity240 at @entity273 means @entity235 will need to use @entity221 's talents further forward finally , owners get the point sunday is a landmark			1
we are 16 weeks into the season and still no @entity40 manager has been sacked			1
that has not happened for 18 years and , if we get to february 16 , it will be a @entity40 record for managers ’ longevity and stability			2
you hope this starts a trend			0
i ’d like to think that owners are resisting the early panic sacking , eight games into the season , when it ’s always too soon to make a judgment			2
in fact , i would advocate having transfer windows for managers , so you have to stick with the coaching staff you appoint at the beginning of the season and ca n’t make a change until january			0
for this season at least , it seems owners have grasped the point			2
let ’s hope it continues			0
@entity306 manager @entity305 is still in a job , despite fans ' unrest earlier in the season @entity305 has since taken the @entity311 up to seventh after inflicting a first defeat on @entity313 this season			2

@entity9 have failed to live up to expectations again this season
@entity5 has had to cope with string of injuries , especially in defence
the @entity144 were extremely *fortunate* to get a *victory* over @entity45
@entity9 need to sign defenders like @entity156 and @entity165
@entity223 has done the right thing by resting @entity221
club owners have not sacked a single @entity40 manager this term
