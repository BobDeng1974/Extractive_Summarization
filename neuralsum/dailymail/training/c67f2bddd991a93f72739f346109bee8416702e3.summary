by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ on one frosty , winter evening at @entity3 in january , @entity2 scored two more goals , bringing up his tally to 23 in his first 33 games for the club			1
it was the @entity10 ’s striker ninth goal in six games , his confidence overflowing as ‘ @entity2 ’ – @entity14 of @entity15 , the nickname referring to the working class district that @entity2 grew up in in @entity18 – savaged defences in a barnstorming introduction to @entity22 football			1
yet since then : nada			0
the beast was tamed , his form shuddering to a startling halt , as the bearded @entity27 failed to score again until the end of the season			1
@entity2 started just seven of those final sixteen appearances , and completed 90 minutes only once in the 5 - 0 win over @entity62 , almost out of pity as manager @entity64 attempted to draw his striker out of the rot			2
it was a peculiar narrative and few were able to diagnose the cause of @entity2 ’s malaise in light of a quite remarkable start to the season			1
one theory concerns the knock to the shoulder that @entity2 suffered in the 3 - 0 victory over @entity78 , leaving @entity3 with his right arm in a sling			2
but @entity64 consistently insisted that it was only a brief irritation and it does seem a stretch to hypothesise that this injury has significantly contributed to @entity2 ’s downturn in form			1
another suggestion from @entity32 is that amid the adrenalin of his opening months in @entity88 , @entity2 played beyond all expectations , entering the form of his life and providing a misguided perception of his true credentials			1
one source close to his former club @entity95 predicted in december that @entity2 ’s limitations as a footballer always dictated that a slump would follow the spurt			2
it seems a harsh appraisal but it has proved startlingly accurate			0
second string : @entity2 often found himself as second choice for @entity10 behind @entity53 late in the season @entity106 's first goal for @entity10 certainly , concerns did emerge at @entity10 in the final weeks of the season , as @entity64 appeared to lose faith in his £ 20million signing			1
in each of the club ’s final three @entity59 games , every one must - win as @entity10 accelerated their pursuit of the @entity59 title , @entity2 was only introduced after the 85th minute , after the victories had already been sealed			1
@entity2 had by that point become an apology for the muscular presence that had just weeks earlier terrorised @entity59 defences , scoring goals and striking up a potent partnership with @entity122			1
suddenly , it all looked woefully like labour to him , as if he were a pianist whose timing had deserted hm			0
he became hesitant in front of goal , jittering , pontificating and losing that defining ability to remain detached when faced by a goalkeeper			0
exclusion from @entity32 ’s final pool of 23 for the @entity133 in @entity134 soon followed and it is understood that @entity2 believes that this struggles in @entity88 were responsible , although he also recognises that @entity64 had little choice but to turn to @entity53 when the heat was on in the final weeks			1
it has , rather predictably , led to speculation that the player might be homesick and yearning for the comforts of his native @entity32			2
this , however , does not fit in with the sound bites @entity2 had been presenting just a few months earlier			1
nickname : @entity10 's number nine has n't been living up to his ' beast ' moniker recently in an interview with a sunday newspaper , @entity2 could not have been more effusive over his transition from rural @entity151 to the plush greenery of the @entity154 outskirts			1
‘ i have liked it here right from the first day , ’ @entity2 said			2
‘ when you go out in the streets people say hello to you , wish you good morning , it ’s a really great feeling			0
' people paint @entity22 a bit black but you know it is not too bad at all			2
it is one of the best decisions i have made on a personal level and a football level			0
’ @entity170 , however , is a fickle profession and a few substitute appearances , a goal drought and international disharmony can do much to change a striker ’s feelings these days			0
nonetheless , such a response would be out - of - sync with a player that emerged as one of the most popular both in the dressing - room and on the terraces at the @entity185 last season			0
for all the mutual admiration , though , the noises from the @entity187 appear increasingly convinced that the player would welcome a return to the @entity191			0
number one : @entity2 was the main man for @entity10 but became a back up figure late in the season down and out : it was a difficult second half to the season for the out - of - sorts striker @entity10 , for their part , insist that they expect the striker to be at the club next season and well - placed source assured @entity204 on thursday that the club are not attempting to alter that situation or encourage interest this summer			1
clearly , @entity64 feels that to cull the striker after twelve months , particularly when his star shone so brightly in the opening part of the campaign , would be a premature and unnecessary response			0
what is evident , however , is that @entity214 require a striker to replace @entity216 and that they may be prepared to test @entity10 ’s resolve with a bid exceeding £ 20m in the coming weeks			0
there is also a growing belief in @entity32 that @entity2 would like a return to his hometown with the @entity32 champions			2
if @entity214 were to follow up the interest with an offer that approached £ 30m , then @entity10 may be forced to seriously reconsider their stance over the 28 - year - old ’s future , particularly if the player states a desire to leave			0
city remain relaxed about the situation , as the @entity10 players return for pre-season in the middle of july , this may be one issues that fills rather more pages of newsprint in the weeks to come			0
powerhouse : @entity2 looked to be one of the signings of the summer but has flopped this year			0

@entity2 has n't scored since january when he reached 23 in 33 games
' @entity14 ' has had his confidence *sapped* after a poor run of form
he lost his place to @entity53 towards the end of the season
and now there is speculation that he is homesick despite earlier *speaking* of his *happiness* at living in @entity22
