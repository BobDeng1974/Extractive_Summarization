by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 became the 13th player to be sent off for @entity4 when he was dismissed against @entity5 in @entity6			1
the @entity8 winger saw red following a clash with @entity10 , who reacted furiously to a wild lunge by the 19 - year - old			1
@entity13 also walked for his part in the incident			0
@entity2 was consoled as he walked down the tunnel by @entity17 - who , as it happens , is one of the other 12 players to be sent off while on @entity4 duty			1
seeing red : @entity2 is sent off for @entity4 after his grapple with @entity10 ( below ) stranglehold : @entity13 grabs @entity2 round the throat before the pair are dismissed @entity26 , june 1968 vs @entity27 @entity28 , june 1973 vs @entity29 @entity30 , june 1977 vs @entity31 @entity32 , june 1986 vs @entity33 @entity34 , june 1998 vs @entity31 @entity35 , september 1998 vs @entity36 @entity37 , june 1999 vs @entity36 @entity38 , september 1999 vs @entity29 @entity39 , october 2002 vs @entity40 @entity34 , october 2005 vs @entity41 @entity42 , july 2006 vs @entity43 @entity44 , october 2009 vs @entity45 @entity42 , october 2011 vs @entity46 @entity17 , september 2012 vs @entity45 the first player to see red as an @entity4 player was @entity26 , in 1968 against @entity27			1
@entity28 was next , in @entity29 five years later , and then came @entity30 , the only other @entity4 man apart from @entity50 to be shown a red card in a friendly			2
@entity32 was the first @entity4 player to be dismissed at a @entity52 , against @entity33 in 1986 and he compounded the offence by throwing the ball towards the @entity56 official and hitting him with it			1
that was it until the most famous red card in @entity4 's international history			2
in @entity62 in 1998 , @entity34 was felled by @entity63 and instinctively and petulantly flicked his leg back at the @entity65 , who went down rather theatrically			0
@entity68 referee @entity67 sent off @entity34 , @entity4 went out on penalties and effigies of the @entity72 star , who would go on to captain his country with distinction , were burned			0
that began a spate of sendings - off ( in relative terms ) at the end of the 1990s			0
@entity34 's former @entity72 team - mate @entity35 was dismissed against @entity36 in 1998 and a year later @entity37 saw red against the same opponents and should have seen red earlier in the match for an horrendous challenge on @entity85			1
@entity38 met with the same fate later that year against @entity29			0
we were two years into the new millennium before the next @entity4 player was sent off , @entity39 for a ludicrous late challenge during a draw with @entity40			1
@entity92 ( @entity52 ) : @entity34 is sent off against @entity31 at @entity93 98 red mist : @entity42 ( second right ) reacts incredulously to being sent off against @entity43 off you go : @entity17 ( second left ) can not believe it after being sent off against @entity45 three years later @entity34 had the dubious honour of being the first @entity4 player to be sent off twice for his country when he had to go after picking up two bookings in two second - half minutes against @entity41			1
@entity101 came another famous case of the @entity52 red mist			0
a barely - fit @entity42 saw his frustration boil over against @entity43 and he went after stamping on a sensitive area of @entity106 - with a wink from @entity108 to send him on his way			0
the next sending - off was nowhere near as crucial , as @entity44 was given his marching orders within the first 15 minutes of a dead rubber in @entity45 , which the home side won 1 - 0			0
he did , however , become the first @entity4 goalkeeper to be dismissed			2
horror tackle : @entity37 was only booked for this challenge on @entity85 but was later sent off walk of shame : @entity26 trudges off after becoming the first @entity4 player to be sent off @entity42 joined @entity34 in the double red card club when he famously and ridiculously kicked out at @entity46 defender @entity119 during a turbulent time in his personal life			1
the dismissal meant @entity42 missed the first two matches of @entity123			0
and finally , @entity17 was given two yellow cards against @entity45 in 2012			0
now @entity2 has become the unlucky 13th - at least he is in some illustrious company .			2

@entity2 dismissed following a clash with @entity10
he became the 13th player to be sent off for @entity4
@entity26 was the first in 1968 and *gerrard* the most recent in 2012
