by @entity0 a new study has found lifestyle choices can account for as much as 33 per cent of how old a woman looks living an unhealthy lifestyle can age a woman ’s skin by over ten years , an in - depth international study has revealed			1
the true damage caused by sun beds , smoking and a lack of fruit and moisturisation in accelerating the ageing process emerged following research on 585 women in the @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
the study , published yesterday , showed the factors influencing their skin were the same even taking into account the backgrounds and skin type of the women involved			1
it also emerged ' lifestyle choices ' often account for as much as 33 per cent of how old a woman looks			1
dr @entity31 , who led the study for simple skincare , said : ' we already knew genetics accounted for about 50 per cent of how old people look , but we did n’t know how much would be accounted for by their lifestyles			2
' even we were surprised by just how much it was ; both in terms of the number of years and the percentage			0
' the study which was carried out over the last eight years involved women aged 45 to 75 in the @entity18 , 30 to 70 in @entity20 and 25 to 70 in @entity19			1
study sites with controlled laboratory conditions were established in @entity47 in the @entity18 , @entity48 in @entity20 and @entity49 in @entity19			1
those who took part were asked a string of questions about their lifestyles including whether or not they liked to sun tan and if they were smokers or non-smokers			2
other questions included how often the women moisturised , whether they eat fruit and veg , whether they brush their teeth and if they have all their own teeth			2
the research team also took digital images of the women which were then assessed for how old they looked to identify their perceived age and whether they looked younger or older than their actual age			0
the study , which was carried out over the last eight years , asked women questions about their lifestyle , including whether or not they smoked those taking part in the research were also asked whether or not they liked to sun tan and how often they moisturised the research team , led by @entity79 , then compared the perceived ages of those with good versus bad lifestyles			1
they concluded the difference was 10.4 years			0
' we already knew genetics accounted for about 50 per cent of how old people look , but we did n’t know how much would be accounted for by their lifestyles ' - dr @entity31 dr @entity79 added : ' the number of years ' difference was most staggering - we had just seen some data out of a group of plastic surgeons in the @entity94 and @entity95 suggesting that a face and neck lift ( together with eyelid and forehead modifications ) could take an average of about 8.5 years off your facial age			0
' then we got our data through demonstrating a saving of over 10 years			0
it ’s fair to say at first we could n’t quite believe it			0
' but the evidence was there in front of us - women with a healthy lifestyle looked much younger than those with an unhealthy lifestyle			0
' simply put ; good skin health is about more than fancy creams and lotions - it ’s about how we live our lives and how we treat our bodies and the steps we need to take do not need to be extreme .			0
