many theoretical physicists believe the universe could end someday – and the process is likely to have already begun			0
while no one knows for certain how it will happen , there are three leading theories dubbed the big crunch , the big rip and the big freeze , that could lead to our demise			1
now a @entity13 - based group , called @entity14 , has put together a video explaining how exactly these theories will bring to end the world as we know it			1
galaxies would tear apart , followed by black holes , planets and stars they claim all humanity will either slowly decay into radiation , completely vanish after collapsing in on itself or be ripped apart as the universe ’s expansion speeds up			1
in the ‘ big rip ’ scenario , dark energy could be warping the universe ’s scaffolding causing galaxies to tear apart first , followed by smaller black holes , planets and stars			1
this , according to @entity41 , would take place once the ever - increasing pull of the universe 's expansion gets stronger than the gravity holding galaxies together			2
the universe could eventually expand at the speed of light , and when this happens , the forces holding substances together would break down			0
as a result , the universe will be empty , holding only single particles that are unconnected to anything else in existence			0
several years ago , researchers said the universe is expanding at a rate comparable to a rollercoaster , after they mapped the galaxies for the first time as they were 11 billion years ago			2
the @entity61 : gravity would become the most powerful force in the universe			1
the rate that the universe expands would decrease and the universe would start to collapse			1
the @entity67 : in this end - of - the - universe scenario , matter would stay together , but would decay into radiation as the universe expands			1
the @entity71 : this would start once the pull of the universe 's expansion gets stronger than gravity			2
galaxies would tear apart , followed by black holes , planets and stars			2
dr @entity81 from the @entity82 explained that the universe 's growth when it was young was slowed by the effects of gravity			2
but in the past five billion years it has begun to rapidly expand because of a mysterious force which scientists have called dark energy			1
another potential end to the universe could be through something nicknamed the ‘ big crunch ’			1
this could happen if , instead of expanding , matter in the universe decreases over time , causing gravity to become the dominant force			1
gravity would cause the universe to shrink			2
the result would be colliding stars , galaxies and planets as the universe collapses in on itself			0
and the process could already be taking place somewhere in our cosmos and is eating away at the rest of the universe , according to theoretical physicists			0
the mind - bending concept has been around for a while , but last year researchers in @entity116 claimed they have proven it is possible with mathematical equations			0
another potential end to the universe could be through something nicknamed the ‘ big crunch ’			1
this could happen if matter in the universe decreases over time , causing gravity to become the dominant force this violent process is called a ‘ phase transition ’ and is similar to what happens when , for example , water turns to steam or a magnet heats up and loses its power			2
according to something known as the @entity135 theory , a phase transition such as this took place one tenth of a billionth of a second after the @entity141 , causing a shift in the fabric of space - time			0
during this transition , empty space became filled with an invisible substance that we now call the @entity135			0
some elementary particles interact with this field , gaining energy in the process , and this intrinsic energy is known as the mass of a particle			0
by using mathematical equations , researchers at the @entity157 have discovered that the @entity135 field could exist in two states , just like matter can exist as a liquid or a solid			0
in the second state , the @entity135 field is billions of times denser than what scientists have already observed			0
in the ' big crunch ' , gravity would cause the universe to shrink			1
the result would be colliding stars , galaxies and planets as the universe collapses in on itself if this ultra-dense @entity135 field exists , then a ' bubble ' of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at any time , similar to when you boil water			0
the bubble would then expand at the speed of light , entering all space , and turning the @entity135 field from the state it is in now into a new one			0
the final scenario – and the most likely to take place according to current physics knowledge - humanity could either see a ‘ big freeze ’ or ‘ heat death ’			1
in this scenario , matter would slowly decay into radiation as the universe expands			1
after trillions of years , even the atoms making up the remaining matter would start to degrade and disintegrate			0
stars would dissolve , black holes would evaporate and eventually even light particles would vanish			0
ultimately , further advances in fundamental physics are required before it will be possible to know the ultimate fate of the universe with any level of certainty			0
the final scenario – and the most likely to take place according to current physics knowledge - humanity could either see a ‘ big freeze ’ or ‘ heat death ’			1
in this event , matter would slowly decay into radiation as it expands			2

@entity13 group , @entity14 , has created a video of the leading scenarios
in the ' big crunch ' , gravity would be most powerful force in the universe
rate that universe expands would decrease and it would start to collapse
in the ' big freeze ' scenario , matter would decay as the universe expands
during the ' big rip ' galaxies would tear apart as dark energy warps matter
