' they suffered a lot from @entity98 's injury after @entity96 was out for a long time			0
' but when everybody 's there , it is a team who look quite dangerous going forward			0
' @entity109 was back in goal against @entity12 for the first time since the @entity113 defeat at @entity114 , after which the @entity115 international was reported to have been smoking in the showers			0

' for me that is the most important when a player is questioned at some stage , how he responds shows you his strength of character , and on that front @entity144 has done extremely well until now			0
' at the moment , the competition is there			0
