by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 17 january 2013 the news that some of @entity4 ’s favourite supermarkets have been selling horse meat has come as a shock to many shoppers			1
after all , the big retailers never miss an opportunity to remind us of their ‘ high standards ’			1
in their advertising campaigns , they boast of meeting the customers ’ needs through their rigorous quality control , and delight in telling us which particular farmer their produce comes from			2
following scandals such as the @entity22 ‘ mad cow ’ outbreak and the great salmonella scare , they also now trumpet their adherence to food safety throughout their supply lines			2
food chain : do you really know what you are eating ? ( file picture ) meanwhile , shoppers are assured that rigorous regulations on labelling mean we know exactly what we are buying			2
dodgy meat , like the sale of contaminated eggs , was meant to be a thing of the past in the brave new shiny world of mass retailing			1
yet the revelation that several of the country ’s biggest names — including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 — have been selling beef burgers that contain horse meat should come as no surprise			1
for the fact is that our trust in the big supermarket chains is badly misplaced			1
the sheer massiveness of the scale of their operations is a central part of the problem			2
the industrialisation of the food supply , driven by the big retailers and reflected in everything from mass factory farming to the vast distribution networks , is bound to lead to corners cut and standards compromised			1
not shocked : the revelation that burgers containing horse meat were on sale at some supermarkets came as no surprise to @entity0 the big supermarkets put relentless pressure on their suppliers to give them the lowest price possible			1
the suppliers respond in turn by downgrading the quality of their meat and using cheaper ingredients			1
it ’s not just supermarket customers who have had horse meat on their plates recently			1
but at least diners at the @entity92 restaurant in @entity93 knew what they were getting			0
owner @entity95 has been serving horse steak for two years , usually raw			1
he was sorry yesterday he had none available , given the interest sparked by the contaminated supermarket burgers story			1
‘ supply is not easy , because our horse meat comes from @entity103 , and we ’d certainly not use just any horse			1
ours are bred by farmers in the @entity108 region , from a rare breed , especially for eating			0
’ at the restaurant , a @entity110 is a starter costing less than £ 10			0
it ’s made of minced fillet of horse , mixed with raw egg , chopped onion , chilli sauce and capers			2
@entity95 says the dish is very popular , as are grilled horse steaks			2
though @entity124 butchers will supply horse steak if asked , no other @entity4 restaurant serves the meat because most brits wo n’t touch it			1
in @entity103 , by contrast , they eat their way through 70,000 horses a year			0
horse meat also remains popular in @entity132 — sometimes as a sausage or in a stew			1
in @entity136 , horse sashimi ( served rare ) is a delicacy , and much of @entity139 ’s national cuisine is based around the flesh			2
it is largely the @entity143 - speaking countries of the @entity144 — @entity4 , @entity145 and the @entity146 — where eating it has become something of a taboo , mainly because these days we view horses more as pets than farm animals or livestock			0
burgers are particularly vulnerable to such downgrading because they are made of processed meat , which dramatically widens the scope for adulteration compared to , say , a chicken breast or a piece of steak			1
indeed , the process of mincing hides a multitude of sins			0
in its classic form , a burger should be nothing more than minced beef , salt and freshly ground pepper			0
but in the supermarket , even a premium burger has to contain only 80 per cent of the meat named in the title , usually beef or chicken			2
the rest can be made up of assorted additives , fat and soya protein to bulk out the mixture			0
when it comes to economy burgers ( like those tested from the four major chains by the @entity189 ’s horse meat investigation ) , just 59 per cent of content needs to be meat			1
even this 59 per cent is allowed to include the unsavoury - sounding ‘ mechanically recovered meat ’ ( @entity193 ) , which is little more than a pink slurry produced by grinding every last remnant from the animal ’s carcass under high pressure			2
although if this substance is added to the cheap and uncheerful mix , it would have to be labelled			0
until recently , @entity193 was allowed to contain even the spinal column of cows , though this was finally banned after concern that such a source could be passing on @entity22 to humans			0
yet the quality remains poor			0
among the 21 listed ingredients for one typical ‘ economy ’ burger are : rusk , ‘ soya protein isolate ’ , preservative , stabilisers to hold it together ( diphosphates , triphosphates ) , sugar , malt extract , pepper extract and beef fat			0
given such a cocktail of chemical and synthetic ingredients , it is little wonder that some suppliers felt they could get away with sneaking in a bit of horse meat			1
if proper controls were working , of course , they could never have done so			0
but the truth is that the supermarkets ’ labelling and safety procedures are not nearly as rigorous as they like to pretend , particularly when it comes to meat processing			1
most of this food preparation takes place in dank , noisy processing plants , carried out by a disgruntled , badly paid , often migrant workforce			2
the required food checks are not subject to external or spot inspections			0
these checks amount to little more than a box - ticking exercise			0
suppliers simply give their written assurance that they ’ve shown ‘ due diligence ’ and complied with a series of official safety requirements , called @entity255 or @entity255			0
these have their origins in the @entity146 during @entity258 when they were introduced to regulate the testing of munitions			0
food haccp systems are now widely used across the globe to protect public health			0
but to ensure proper compliance , they should be policed by either the supermarkets themselves or @entity269 officials , such as food safety inspectors or @entity272 officers			2
@entity274 house : supermarkets put pressure on suppliers to give them the lowest price possible and in turn suppliers downgrade the quality of their meat ( file picture ) however , these official inspections do not happen as often as they should , partly because austerity measures have led to cutbacks in local government budgets , and partly because the supermarkets do not want the burden of extra costs			1
so retailers pass on the responsibility to suppliers , who have a vested interest in keeping scrutiny to a minimum			0
i suspect the current scandal was exposed not through rigorous inspection , but the actions of a whistleblower in one of the supply firms based in @entity145			0
perhaps fed up with poor pay and hellish conditions , or sickened by unsavoury practices , they may have contacted the @entity189 to complain about what their company was up to			0
of course , it ’s important to remember that there is no actual health risk to eating horse meat			1
it was consumed in @entity4 until the 20th century , and even today it is not illegal to sell it here			0
every year , @entity4 sends around 10,000 horses to @entity318 for consumption , particularly to @entity103 , where it remains a popular part of the national diet			0
good quality ? consumers have the right to know what they are eating and the big supermarkets have let us down with their casual approach to enforcement ( file picture ) but although eating horse meat will do us no harm , it is nevertheless fraudulent to pass it off as a classic beef burger			1
consumers have the right to know what they are eating and the big supermarkets have let us down with their casual approach to enforcement			1
indeed , the problem extends further than horse meat			1
this investigation has shown that many beef ready meals also contained traces of pig dna			0
this makes their sale not merely an act of serious misrepresentation but also highly offensive to @entity351 and @entity352			0
nor , incidentally , is horse meat strictly kosher			1
the supermarkets ’ obsession with a price - driven , over-mechanised approach to food is profoundly misguided			2
adulteration is the price we pay for over-industrialisation			0
this horse meat scandal shows what i and other food writers have long argued — that we would all be better relying on local butchers , suppliers and locally sourced foods			1
of course , the supermarket giants exposed for selling horse meat were quick to try to reassure customers			1
@entity47 ’s technical director @entity372 said his company would ‘ not tolerate any compromise in the quality of the food we sell			0
our customers have the right to expect that the food they buy is produced to the highest standards			0
’ but every new scandal undermines shoppers ’ trust in the supermarket giants as customers learn the painful lesson that their stranglehold can so easily be a recipe for dubious products of unsavoury pedigree			2
@entity0 is author of what to eat .			1

our trust in the big supermarkets is badly misplaced , writes @entity0
