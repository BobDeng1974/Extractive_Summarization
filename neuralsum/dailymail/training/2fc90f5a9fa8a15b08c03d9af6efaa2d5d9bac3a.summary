rather than blighting rooftops as at present , future solar panels could be sprayed onto tiles by a ghostbuster - style team			1
scientists from the @entity5 invented a new way to spray solar cells onto flexible surfaces using miniscule light - sensitive materials known as colloidal quantum dots ( @entity11 )			1
@entity12 at the @entity13 said : ' my dream is that one day you 'll have two technicians with @entity19 backpacks come to your house and spray your roof			2
the surface of a car roof would produce enough power for three 100 - @entity35 light bulbs or 24 compact fluorescents			1
and the breakthrough could send prices of solar panels crashing			2
the system @entity40 is a play on the manufacturing process called @entity42 , short for atomic layer deposition , in which materials are laid down on a surface one atom - thickness at a time			0
until now , it was only possible to incorporate light - sensitive @entity25 onto surfaces through batch processing - an inefficient , slow and expensive assembly - line approach to chemical coating			1
@entity53 blasts a liquid containing @entity11 directly onto flexible surfaces , such as film or plastic , like printing a newspaper by applying ink onto a roll of paper			0
potential breakthrough : rather than blighting rooftops as at present , future solar panels could be sprayed onto tiles by a @entity19 - style team this roll - to - roll coating method makes incorporating solar cells into existing manufacturing processes much simpler			2
two papers published in the journals @entity70 and @entity71 showed that the @entity75 method can be used on flexible materials without any major loss in solar - cell efficiency			1
and the system is easily built using a spray nozzle used in steel mills to cool steel with a fine mist of water and a few regular air brushes from an art store			0
he added : ' this is something you can build in a @entity91 fashion , which is basically how we did it			0
we think of this as a no - compromise solution for shifting from batch processing to roll - to - roll			0
' professor @entity97 said : ' as quantum dot solar technology advances rapidly in performance , it 's important to determine how to scale them and make this new class of solar technologies manufacturable ' we were thrilled when this attractively manufacturable spray - coating process also led to superior performance devices showing improved control and purity			1
' thing of the past ? traditional solar panels may no longer be the best way to harness the sun 's energy			0

scientists from @entity5 hope to make breakthrough soon
solar - sensitive spray printed on flexible film could coat all kinds of objects
surface of car roof could produce enough power for three 100 - @entity35 bulbs
