‘ then it came up even worse so i eventually said to her a couple of days later and she took me to the doctors			0
’ @entity8 ’s mother , @entity38 , said : ‘ at first i thought it was an infection from having the piercing			1
i never thought it would be anything else			2
’ initially doctors thought the same but as time passed more lumps appeared and @entity8 was sent for a series of tests			1

‘ i had never heard of it before in my life , ’ said @entity8 , who also has an older half - brother @entity64 , 20 , and younger sister @entity65 , 9			1

@entity8 ( pictured with her friends after their hair cuts ) has now started chemotherapy her mother said : ‘ @entity8 went into school on the monday , after finding out on the friday , and asked to take a group of 10 friends to one side to tell them what happened			1
