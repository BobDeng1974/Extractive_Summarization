by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 3 january 2013 @entity2 's crimes so shocked the nation that they became the benchmark by which other acts of evil were measured			1
but behind bars the @entity8 set about a rigorous course of self - improvement , secret files reveal			0
she wanted to transform herself from a ‘ brassy blonde ’ to an ‘ intelligent , well - educated woman with middle - class values ’			1
self - improvement : moors murderer @entity2 turned herself from a ' brassy blonde ' to an ' intelligent , well - educated woman ' and even earned an @entity20 degree , pictured right she took up hobbies including badminton and making tapestries , ‘ threw herself with enthusiasm into the choir ’ and won a music prize for a love song			1
prison papers describe the child killer as an ‘ extremely meticulous person ... even obsessive ’ , with one governor noting : ‘ her room is always tidy and very clean			1
' but prison officials continued to regard @entity2 suspiciously as an ‘ arch - manipulator ’ and a ‘ scheming woman ’ who was ‘ cold and calculating ’ , ‘ devoid of emotion ’ and should not be trusted , the files show			1
with her lover and partner in crime @entity43 , @entity2 was responsible for the murders of five children in the 1960s			1
they were lured to their deaths , sexually tortured and buried on @entity50 near @entity51			1
evil : @entity43 who killed five children with @entity2 between july 1963 and october 1965 @entity2 died in 2002 aged 60 and her confidential files were supposed to have remained secret for another 50 years			1
but they have been released early to the national archives owing to the huge interest in her life			1
@entity62 , a @entity63 lecturer , has spent three years studying them			0
the boxes of typed reports and handwritten notes fill more than 30ft of shelf space and give a unique picture of @entity2 as seen through the eyes of fellow prisoners , welfare workers , probation officers , warders and chaplains			2
@entity2 became a practising @entity77 and dedicated student , earning an @entity20 degree in @entity80			1
‘ @entity2 is a young woman of superior intellect and academic ability , ’ wrote one observer			1
and her ability to soak up information was undoubtedly aided by an amazing gift			0
she has ‘ almost total recall of the spoken and written word ’ , said one assessment			0
her tutor recalled how she sat o - level @entity97 and once out of the examination room ‘ wrote the entire paper out again from memory so that i could go through it and assess her chances ’			0
@entity2 was jailed for life in may 1966 for the murders of @entity101 , ten , and @entity43 , 17 , plus being accessory to the murder of 12 - year - old @entity104 by @entity105			1
in 1987 @entity2 and @entity105 confessed to murdering @entity106 , 16 , and @entity107 , 12			2
despite her criminal notoriety she had a ‘ very conscientious ’ attitude towards her jobs in jail and was put in charge of the kitchen on e wing at @entity115 in @entity116			0
her view that she was better than her fellow inmates quickly became obvious			0
‘ @entity2 is fundamentally a very arrogant woman and considers herself superior to the other members of her wing , ’ said a 1968 report			1
she revelled in her celebrity status and put herself as being among the ‘ elite ’ lifers			0
for @entity127 dinner in 1969 she and another lifer refused to join the others ‘ through feelings of superiority ’			0
and ten years into her sentence it was noted after a routine cell change how she would gather several ‘ sycophants who will do all the cleaning , fetching and carrying she has become accustomed to ’			0
however , most of the time she got on well with fellow inmates , despite her reputation			0
victims : @entity106 , 16 , left , was their first victim and @entity104 was killed in 1963 murdered : @entity101 , 10 , left , and @entity43 , 17 , right twelve - year - old @entity142 was abducted on his way to visit his grandmother in @entity51 on 16 june 1964			1
his body has never been found ‘ women have confessed their horror on learning they were to join a wing with @entity2 on it , only to admit later what a pleasant and easy woman she was to get on with			1
’ one prisoner subjected to an unprovoked attack while serving tea wrote to the governor to praise @entity2			2
‘ i owed a special thanks to inmate @entity156 who literally threw herself between the attacker and myself whilst i was being kicked , ’ she said			0
‘ due to this unselfish assistance she suffered blows and kicks that were meant for me			0
’ as far back as 1974 the prison governor , who had hour - long monthly chats with @entity2 , was sufficiently impressed to suggest a ‘ target date ’ be set so that ‘ parole should be a practical possibility ’			1
by 1977 @entity2 ’s obsession with course work – tackling subjects as diverse as @entity171 , the 19th century novel and its legacy , and 20th century poetry – meant she put on weight through lack of exercise			2
after @entity2 was transferred to @entity177 , a tutor remained sceptical about her motives for self education , saying : ‘ her outside contacts and studies are convincing her she is more able than i think she is			2
i admire the way she refuses to allow herself to become a cabbage			0
but i do not trust her			0
‘ she often appears to me to be a scheming woman , building up contacts with anyone she thinks has influence			2
’ by 1981 , a report concluded : ‘ she has changed from the brassy blonde of more than 16 years ago to the current picture of an intelligent , well - educated woman who possesses some taste and whose views seem culturally more attuned to middle - class values			1
’ yet she never lost the ability to manipulate others			0
jailed : @entity2 was put in charge of the kitchen on e wing at @entity115 in @entity116 and died in 2002 at @entity203 , @entity204 ‘ she was cold and calculating and devoid of emotion , able to smile or cry as the need arose			2
’ by the time she confessed to the two further child murders @entity2 was writing a book and keeping up with ‘ national and inter-national affairs by reading the @entity211 and listening to the radio ’ , said a report			2
it added : ‘ she has developed a particularly good relationship with her personal officer and in fact rehearsed her confession to her before her formal interview with police			0
’ @entity2 was transferred to @entity203 , @entity204 , in 1998 and spent her final years in ‘ unofficial segregation ’ with a television , video recorder and word processor in her single room			2
