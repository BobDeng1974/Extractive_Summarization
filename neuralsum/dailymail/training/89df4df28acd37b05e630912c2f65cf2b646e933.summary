the moment you need to send an urgent text is usually the same moment your battery dies			0
but now @entity5 engineers claim to have developed a solution that allows you to generate power using ' thin air			2
' the technology , known as ‘ ambient backscatter ’ , taps into tv and @entity12 signals both for device communication and as a source of power			1
for instance , a couch could use ambient backscatter to let the user know where his keys were left			2
researchers at @entity28 built small , battery - free devices with antennas that can detect , harness and reflect a tv signal , which can be picked up by other similar devices			1
two devices where then shown to communicate with each other by reflecting the existing signals to exchange information			1
‘ we can repurpose wireless signals that are already around us into both a source of power and a communication medium , ’ said @entity38 , an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at @entity28			1
‘ it ’s hopefully going to have applications in a number of areas including wearable computing , smart homes and self - sustaining sensor networks			0
’ using ambient backscatter , these devices can interact with users and communicate with each other without using batteries			1
they exchange information by reflecting or absorbing pre-existing radio signals @entity62 backscatter transforms existing wireless signals into both a source of power and a communication medium			1
it enables two battery - free devices to communicate by backscattering existing wireless signals			1
since it uses the ambient radio frequency signals that are already around us , it does n't require a dedicated power infrastructure			2
eventually , the technology could lead to networks of devices and sensors that send data by reflecting existing signals to exchange information , without the need for batteries			2

‘ our devices form a network out of thin air , ’ said co-author @entity85 , a @entity28 associate professor of computer science and engineering and of electrical engineering			0
‘ you can reflect these signals slightly to create a morse code of communication between battery - free devices			2
’ it could potentially be built into mobiles phones to provide emergency power when the battery has died			1
everyday objects could also be enabled with battery - free tags to communicate with each other			1
for instance , a couch could use ambient backscatter to let the user know where house keys were left			0
researchers demonstrate how one payment card can transfer funds to another card by leveraging the existing wireless signals around them			0
@entity118 signals are both the power source and the communication medium smart sensors could be built and placed permanently inside any structure , then set to communicate with each other			1
for example , sensors placed in a bridge could monitor the health of the concrete and steel , then send an alert if one of the sensors picks up a hairline crack			0
the researchers tested the ambient backscatter technique with credit card - sized prototype devices placed within several feet of each other			0
for each device the researchers built antennas into ordinary circuit boards that flash an led light when receiving a communication signal from another device			0
groups of the devices were tested in a variety of settings in the @entity150 area , including inside an apartment building , on a street corner and on the top level of a parking garage			0
these locations ranged from less than half a mile away from a tv tower to about 6.5 miles away			0
video : how ambient backscatter transforms existing wireless signals into both a source of power and a communication medium researchers then demonstrated how one payment card can transfer funds to another card by leveraging the existing wireless signals around them			1
@entity62 radio frequency signals became both the power source and the communication medium			1
they found that the devices were able to communicate with each other , even the ones farthest from a tv tower			2
the receiving devices picked up a signal from their transmitting counterparts at a rate of 1 kilobit per second when up to 2.5 feet apart outdoors and 1.5 feet apart indoors			0
this is enough to send information such as a sensor reading , text messages and contact information			0
the researchers now hop to advance the capacity and range of the ambient backscatter communication network .			0

@entity62 backscatter uses tv and @entity12 signals as a source of power
*system* could be built into mobile phones to remove the need for batteries
everyday objects could also be given tags to communicate with each other
