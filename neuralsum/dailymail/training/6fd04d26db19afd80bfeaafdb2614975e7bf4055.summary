by @entity0 a mother desperate for a lung transplant has said she would gladly accept the organs of a smoker rather than die on the transplant list			1
@entity6 suffers from cystic fibrosis and has been warned by her doctors she needs a transplant in order to survive			1
one in three people waiting for new lungs die on the transplant list and she has already been waiting five months			1
@entity6 suffers from cystic fibrosis and has been warned by her doctors she needs a transplant in order to survive			1
she says she would gladly accept the organs of a smoker rather than die on the transplant list @entity6 , who has two young daughters , told @entity21 's @entity20 : ' yes , transplants are risky , but the biggest risk for me is not getting any lungs at all			1
' anything that i can do to increase the chance , i am prepared to do			0
i am the mother of two daughters and i want to be here for them			0
' ' for me , the risk of getting lung cancer from a smoker 's lungs in one , 10 , 20 years time is very small - compared to the risk that i wo n't get new lungs at all			1
' it 's absolutely an option i am willing to take			0
' @entity6 , who has two young daughters , told @entity21 's @entity20 : ' yes , transplants are risky , but the biggest risk for me is not getting any lungs at all			1
anything that i can do to increase the chance , i am prepared to do ' last week the @entity45 called for smokers ' lungs to be made more widely available to transplant patients			1
the current rules are that a donor should not have smoked more than a pack a day for 20 years			0
anyone who has smoked more than this is classed as a marginal donor			0
but doctors are warning that many lungs that could be used for people like @entity6 are being thrown away			1
discovery : transplant patients who are given smokers ' lungs ( right ) are just as likely to survive as those who receive organs from non-smokers ( left ) , a study has revealed			1
some patients even had higher survival rates last month it was revealed that one in five lung transplant patients are given organs from 20 - a - day smokers			1
in fact , almost a half of donated lungs come from someone who had smoked , according to a major @entity75 study			2
despite this , the researchers said patients ' survival rate was not harmed by receiving a smoker 's lungs and the research should ease patients ' fears about donors who had smoked			2
@entity6 said : ' i have had to start thinking about if i do n't get a transplant			1
i have started writing letters i can leave for my daughters if the worst happens ' the study showed that patients who received lungs from non-smokers actually had a slightly lower one - year survival rate			2
the research was carried out at @entity96 in north - west @entity97			0
@entity6 's condition is now at the stage where she needs an hour of physiotherapy every day and an hour using a nebuliser ( to deliver medication )			1
she told hosts @entity103 and @entity105 : ' i have good days and bad days , but i am progressively getting worse			0
cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus			1
symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough , recurring chest infections and failure to thrive			0
as the condition develops , a lung transplant may be required			2
there is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long - term damage caused by infections			1
the most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs , and antibiotics to treat the infections			2
the condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build - up of mucus			0
for a child to inherit the condition , both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene			0
in this situation , there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes , a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer , and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition			0
about one in every 2,500 babies born in the @entity75 are born with cystic fibrosis			1
as treatments have improved , the outlook for these children has improved dramatically			0
life expectancy remains in the 40s			0

' they are obviously aware of my condition and try and help me			0
' in 2012 , 188 lung transplants were carried out			2
yet at any one time there are about 240 people waiting for such an operation			0
recent developments in techniques , sometimes dubbed ‘ washing ’ , mean that today just over a third of lung transplants come from patients who smoked			2
doctors believe that if rules were relaxed further , up to 100 more lungs a year would become available			2
these would be from groups designated ‘ sub-optimal ’ – not considered good enough to donate campaigners also want the rules regarding age limits for donors erased , and for lungs from those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma , diabetes and even hepatitis to be considered viable			0
‘ common sense suggests that lungs from a donor who smoked ca n’t be very healthy , but studies have shown that three - year survival rates following a lung transplant are unaffected by whether or not the donor was a smoker , ’ says @entity198 , professor of respiratory transplant medicine at @entity200			1
some risk continues to exist , such as development of lung cancer in the donor lung of a smoker			1
tiny cancers are not visible on inspection so there is a small chance that such a cancer could be transplanted with the donor lung			2
but this is a very rare occurrence			0
’ the average survival after a lung transplant is six years			2
‘ it is more important to get a transplant performed than worry about potential risks that may or may not happen 15 years later , ’ adds professor @entity198			0
fears were raised two years ago after the shock lung cancer death of @entity230 , a 27 - year - old @entity231 patient			1
sixteen months earlier she had undergone a lung transplant – she later found out that the donor had smoked 20 cigarettes a day throughout their life			1

@entity6 has cystic fibrosis and needs a transplant
she has been on the transplant list for five months already
she knows she will probably not survive without a transplant
she would rather risk lung cancer than risk not getting new lungs
