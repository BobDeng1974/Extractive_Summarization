by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 04:09 est , 12 july 2012 anyone who has watched @entity2 could n’t fail to remember the dramatic scene			2
after tunnelling out of a prisoner of war camp , two @entity5 escapees are caught out by replying in @entity7 to a suspicious @entity9 official who wishes them ‘ good luck ’			1
but perhaps post office boss @entity12 had never seen the film – for a similar slip - up has landed him with a four - year jail sentence for stealing more than £ 400,000			1
theft : @entity12 stole more than £ 400,000 in cash from the @entity18 ( pictured ) while he was working there after being arrested , @entity12 , 26 , was desperate to convince authorities he suffered from severe mental health problems and should not be sent to prison			0
he pretended to have been ‘ struck dumb by @entity25 ’ and it was claimed that he had not uttered a word in more than a year			1
a judge referred @entity12 to a mental hospital and he took part in a month of consultations – remaining mute throughout			1
but much like flight lieutenant @entity31 in the 1963 film , he slipped up when a psychiatrist wished him ‘ good luck ’ in @entity35 – and he blew his cover by replying ‘ thank you ’ in his native tongue			1
his mental health assessment was abandoned and he was jailed after being found guilty of theft and conspiracy to steal			0
captured : squadron leader @entity42 , played , @entity43 ( right ) , was caught after being ticked by the @entity44 in @entity2 ' wicked deception ' : judge @entity46 told the defendant his ruse had the @entity50 ' jumping through forensic hoops for two years ' after hearing of his conversation with the psychiatrist , a jury unanimously decided he was ‘ mute by malice ’ rather than ‘ mute by visitation of @entity25 ’			1
at his sentencing at @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity12 , who lived in an £ 800,000 house with his family in @entity63 , spoke again – this time to confirm his name and his guilty plea			0
judge @entity46 told him : ‘ this was a wicked deception			2
you have had the crown jumping through forensic hoops for two years			0
‘ a large number of experts were called to examine you at vast public expense			0
i ordered you to hospital for a month where you were unable to maintain your silence , though you had a good go			2
’ @entity12 stole £ 408,000 from @entity18 , @entity59 , between november 2008 and january 2009 to ‘ stave off disaster ’ for his family business .			0

businessman claimed he had gone mute because of the shame of being caught stealing
he kept up the ruse for more than a year and was even sent to a psychiatric hospital by a judge
but he was *rumbled* when a *doctor* wishes him ' good luck ' in @entity35 - and he answered ' thank you '
