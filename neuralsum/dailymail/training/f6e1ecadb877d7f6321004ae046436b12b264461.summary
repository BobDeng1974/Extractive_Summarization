but what is clear , the conversations are of a sexual nature and are to females			2
' he had engaged in conversation with the 16 - year - old between 25th february and 1st march 2013			1
they were of a sexual nature , he called himself @entity119 and told her she was truly beautiful and that he had fallen for her			2

' the court heard @entity22 never met up with any of the girls but eventually accepted he had obtained sexual gratification			1
in mitigation mr @entity142 said : ' there is a sense of bafflement of those around him of how he came to commit this kind of offence			0
' it is not something anybody who knew him had the slightest suspicion of			0
his pleas are accompanied by genuine remorse for his actions and genuine shame at the way he has conducted himself			0
he has as a result of his actions lost everything			0
' he has lost obviously his good name , he ’s an educated man , he had a good job and good career prospects and is a man of positive good character			0
he has also lost his marriage , the relationship of 17 years			0
' mr @entity142 said @entity22 ’s marriage was in difficulty towards the end of 2011 and he had been in a fragile mental health state , suffering a breakdown in october 2011			2
he added : ' he effectively retreated into himself online and created his own virtual reality with an alternative personality where he was able to justify to himself			0
' he did n’t understand the seriousness of what he was engaged in			0
he made no efforts to contact the girls or obtain their addresses and contact details			0
there was no physical contact between him and the child			0
' @entity22 was also ordered to sign the @entity189 ’ @entity190 for a period of ten years , and was given a @entity192 until further order			2
passing sentence judge @entity194 said : ' you engaged in a deliberate policy of seeking out a child who was young enough to be interested in engaging in sexual chat with someone who you pretended to be			1
messaging : @entity22 said there was messaging between them despite knowing she was 13 ' in real life you are a 40 - year - old man with plenty of experience of life and indeed detailed knowledge about children through your work			1
' you were undergoing some problems in your relationship and you sought the virtual reality into the seedy world in which you felt you were able to engage with the young girl pretending to be someone else			0
' there has been some suggestion that you were somewhat naive and did n’t understand the seriousness , i find that hard to accept			0
your whole career has to do with looking after the welfare of children			0
' judge @entity194 said the messages had been a ' deliberate encounter '			1
' the fact is that you sought to engage with a 13 - year - old in sexualised talk , it was a deliberate encounter in which you engaged upon			1
this was certainly something unknown to your colleagues , your wife and neighbours - all of whom considered you to be an entirely respectable individual			1
' the lie you were maintaining was that you spent a considerable amount of time involved in @entity20 over sexualised nature			0
' you did not touch this child but you engaged with her in a way , sometimes called mind games			0
undoubtedly it will have an effect on her in the future when she realises what was taking place			0
' you are well thought of by those who you were n’t aware of the activities you were undertaking			0
there is a deep revulsion for those who seek out remote sexual activity with young girls - this is something which was clearly a sexual thrill as far as you were concerned			1
' you were someone who was employed for the welfare of children			0
you had a considerable amount of trust placed on you by members of the community			0
you engaged upon this communication quite deliberately - the gravity of this is to be marked by immediate custody			0
' after the case det sgt @entity272 of @entity273 said : ' @entity22 actions were reprehensible , using technology to prey on two young girls in separate parts of the country for his own gratification			1
' this behaviour will no doubt horrify members of the public , particularly those who are parents of teenage girls , and it is right @entity22 has been jailed for his actions			1
