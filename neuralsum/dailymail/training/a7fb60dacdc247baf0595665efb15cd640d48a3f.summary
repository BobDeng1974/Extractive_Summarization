@entity0 was accused of ' riding roughshod ' over the views of the religious last night after he was forced to withdraw comments in which he branded opponents of gay marriage ' bigots '			2
the former archbishop of @entity8 , @entity7 , described the deputy prime minister as ' immature ' over remarks he had issued ahead of a reception to mark the end of a consultation on same - sex weddings			1
the @entity15 leader was due to describe opponents of the reform as ' bigots ' , according to a @entity19 press release			1
@entity0 speaking to the actor @entity20 on the night he made a speech at a reception to celebrate the end of the government 's consultation on gay marriage he was expected to say : ' continued trouble in the economy gives the bigots a stick to beat us with , as they demand we “ postpone ” the equalities agenda in order to deal with “ the things people really care about ”			1
' as if pursuing greater equality and fixing the economy simply can not happen at once			0
' but as the incendiary detail of his remarks quickly began to circulate , it prompted a bitter row with mps on the @entity41 who oppose gay marriage , as well as church leaders			2
ninety minutes after issuing the offending statement , mr @entity0 's office mounted an extraordinary attempt to ' recall ' it			0
five minutes later , a new version of the speech was issued , with the reference to ' bigots ' taken out and replaced with ' some people '			1
deputy prime minister @entity0 was today forced to withdraw the statement which accused opponents of gay marriage of being ' bigots ' lord @entity7 ( left ) , the former archbishop of @entity8 , said many people would be ' highly offended ' by mr @entity0 's remarks while conservative mp @entity60 ( right ) said the deputy pm should resign the episode was branded a ' shambles ' last night and succeeded in angering both opponents of gay marriage , who objected to the original remarks , and those in favour of the reform , who were dismayed that mr @entity0 had not delivered them			1
@entity7 said : ' there will be many @entity73 and @entity74 who will be highly offended to be called bigots			0
people who oppose same - sex marriages are doing so on the basis of deeply - held beliefs and we should not be treated in such a way			1
' these are important issues that affect society and therefore it is paramount for the government to give serious attention to those who oppose the rush into gay marriage			2
i 'm totally for equality – that 's not the issue			0
the issue is should we redefine traditional marriage to include same - sex relationships			1
' @entity97 , the political and gay rights campaigner in his @entity100 , @entity101 , flat			0
mr @entity97 said : ' homophobic bigotry does still exist in sections of our society , and we should not be afraid to say so			0
' of mr @entity0 's attempt to withdraw the remark , @entity7 added : ' he must have realised that it would offend people and it does n't actually help the discussion			1
i think it is fairly typical of the way that he and some other people in the @entity116 have tried to ride roughshod over people 's deeply held views			1
this is not the way to conduct mature discussions			0
' right - wing @entity123 mp @entity60 said mr @entity0 should resign			1
' this appears to be his real opinion , ' he said			0
' if he is saying people who disagree with him on gay marriage because of conscientious or religious grounds are bigots then he should not remain deputy prime minister			1
' i would never go around accusing somebody who disagreed with me of being a bigot , and i do n't care if it 's a @entity135 or a conservative minister who 's doing it now – they should not remain in post			2
' the row had unhappy echoes of the so - called ' @entity142 ' furore which engulfed @entity143 during the last general election			0
the then prime minister was caught describing pensioner @entity146 as a ' bigoted woman ' after she confronted him over immigration			1
@entity149 , of the @entity151 campaign group , said : ' these intolerant remarks show that there is nothing liberal about @entity0			0
' it also shows his contempt for the millions of ordinary men and women in this country who oppose the politically correct drive to rip up the centuries - old definition of marriage			2
' perhaps mr @entity0 should stop attacking the @entity164 public and concentrate on fixing the @entity164 's broken economy , which he was actually elected to do			2
' but gay rights campaigner @entity97 , among the guests at last night 's reception in central @entity101 , said : ' quite clearly , some people who oppose same - sex marriage do so because of personal prejudice and intolerance			1
' homophobic bigotry does still exist in sections of our society , and we should not be afraid to say so			0
' @entity176 , chairman of the @entity178 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) @entity15 group , another attendee , tweeted ahead of the event : ' @entity183 does use the word " bigot " in his speech as he 's absolutely right ! ' but @entity188 mp @entity187 said mr @entity0 's media operation was a ' shambles ' , adding : ' this is a government so incompetent they can not even put together a press release properly			1
' a spokesman for mr @entity0 insisted : ' this was not something the deputy prime minister has said			1
it 's not something he was ever going to say because it 's not something he believes			0
it was removed from the draft copy , that should never have been sent out , for that very reason			2
' mr @entity0 revealed last night that the government has received 228,000 responses to the consultation on equal marriage , more than any other issue under the @entity116 government			2
at the reception later , he said : ' i am a little bit surprised to see cameras outside the gates for the slightly obscure reason that they expect me to use a word about opponents of gay marriage that i had no intention of using , would never use			0
it is not the kind of word that i would use			0
' a @entity224 source said : ' the prime minister is committed to this reform and has said we are going to do it before 2015			1
' there will be mps on all sides of the @entity232 who disagree with it , who he does not regard as bigots , who will want to vote against			0
conservative mps will have a free vote but we expect it to command sufficient support to become law			0
