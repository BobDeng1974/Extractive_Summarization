move over @entity0 , see you later @entity2 , adios @entity3			1
scientists have announced that the bones of a new , even larger dinosaur have been found			0
@entity3 currently holds the record for being both the heaviest land animal ever , and the longest , but the fossilized bones of the biggest dinosaur ever discovered have been found in @entity11			1
scientists believe the species of titanosaur weighed in at 170,000 pounds , as heavy as 14 african elephants			1
a local farm worker found the remains which were captured by the @entity19 's @entity18			1
according to the measurements of its gigantic thigh bones , the herbivore would have been 40m ( 130ft ) long and 20m ( 65ft ) tall			2
palaeontologists think it is a new species of titanosaur – part of a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs that were characterised by their long necks and tails and small heads – dating from the @entity103 period			1
the mega dino would have weighed in at 77 tons , making it seven tons heavier than the previous record holder @entity3			1
the creature , which lived in the forests of @entity69 between 95 and 100 million years ago , was yet to be named			1
“ it will be named describing its magnificence and in honour to both the region and the farm owners who alerted us about the discovery , ” the researchers said			2
residents and technicians gather around the bones of a dinosaur at a farm			2
they say it is the largest set of remains of a dinosaur ever found to date vast : the palaeontologists say the find is thought to be a new species of titanosaur ¿ a huge herbivore of the long - necked sauropod group that lived in the @entity129 @entity130 : the bones were initially discovered a year ago in the desert near @entity46 , about 135 miles west of the @entity48 town of @entity49 @entity135 work : the fossils were then excavated by a team of palaeontologists from the @entity81 , led by dr @entity40 and dr @entity139 ( pictured left ) colossal : scientists believe the species of titanosaur weighed in at 170,000 pounds , as heavy as 14 @entity146 elephants long nect : paleontologists in @entity11 's remote @entity69 region have discovered fossils of a creature is believed to be a new species of @entity152 , a long - necked , long - tailed sauropod that walked on four legs and lived some 95 million years ago in the @entity103 the discovery came in the same week scientists confirmed the @entity3 to be the biggest of them all			1
that plant - eating dinosaur weighed a earth - shaking 90 tons when it lived about 90 million years ago in @entity11 , although the record has been broken by this new find			1
@entity161 palaeontologist dr @entity160 , who led the study , says the dinosaur weigh - in included species ranging from small bird - like dinosaurs to well - known carnivores such as the @entity0			2
the @entity0 , which weighed 7 tons , was the largest meat - eating dinosaur in the study , but it is small in comparison to the @entity3			1
immense : the museum has retrieved some 150 bones said to come from seven individuals , all in remarkable condition massive : given the size of these bones , which surpass any of the previously known giant animals , the new dinosaur is the largest animal known to have walked on @entity183 a sparrow - sized bird called @entity185 , which lived about 120 million years ago in @entity186 , earned the distinction of being the smallest dinosaur , weighing a mere 15 grams			1
dr @entity160 said @entity3 , which roamed around @entity34 , was about 6 million times the weight of @entity185 and that both still fit within the dinosaur family			2
' that seems amazing to me , ' he said			0
the largest meat - eating dinosaur was @entity0 , which weighed 7 tons and is also the largest known land predator of all time			2
the @entity0 edged out another super predator that some scientists had once figured was bigger based on the length of its skull , @entity204 , which lived alongside @entity3 in ancient @entity34			2
the study estimated @entity204 at about 6 tons , pretty darned big , but just a bit shy of dethroning @entity0			0
remote location : @entity3 also from @entity69 and discovered in 1987 was originally estimated at 100 tons but its weight was later revised downwards to around 70 puzzle : one problem with assessing the weight of both @entity3 and this new discovery is that they ¿ re both based on very fragmentary specimens ¿ no complete skeleton is known , which means the animal ¿ s proportions and overall shape are conjectural introducing : paleontologist @entity220 speaks to the press about a newly discovered dinosaur discovered in @entity11 in @entity223 , @entity11 scenic : the fossils , found in @entity69 , provide the first evidence that the whip - tailed diplodocid sauropods survived well beyond the @entity229 period , when they were thought to have been made extinct teamwork : the fossils were then excavated by a team of palaeontologists from the @entity81 , led by dr @entity40 and dr @entity139 dinosaurs had a remarkable run on @entity183			1
they first appeared about 228 million years ago during the @entity239 period , achieved stunning dimensions during the ensuing @entity229 and then disappeared at the end of the @entity103 about 65 million years ago			0
all but the birds , that is			0
the mass extinction at the end of the @entity103 , caused by an asteroid that hit @entity247 , doomed most creatures but some birds survived			0
@entity160 said this study underscores the reasons that birds made it while their bigger dinosaur brethren did not			0
other groups of dinosaurs such as long - necked sauropods like @entity3 , the tank - like ankylosaurs , the duck - billed hadrosaurs , the spike - tailed stegosaurs and the meat - eating tyrannosaurs were essentially locked into a certain ecological niche			1
but birds filled all kinds of ecological niches with their widely diverse body sizes and ' occupations '			0
flying birds lived in all kinds of different habitats , both inland and coastal , and came in a wide range of sizes			0
but there also were large , ostrich - like flightless birds like @entity276 and flightless diving birds like @entity278			0
groundbreaking : they unearthed the partial skeletons of seven individuals - about 150 bones in total - all in remarkable condition documenting the moment : a film crew from the @entity18 was there to capture the moment the scientists realised exactly how big their discovery was bones recovered : @entity220 and his team of @entity11 paleontologists say the 19 vertebrae they recovered in @entity69 region belongs to a new species of @entity297 they named @entity298 , providing what they say is the first evidence that a family of long - necked , whip - tailed dinosaurs survived beyond the @entity229 period , when they were thought to have gone extinc ' it might be that they were simply much more ecologically diverse and that could have helped them survive an extinction , ' said @entity160 , who also noted that smaller creatures did a better job surviving the asteroid impact at the end of the @entity103			1
paleontologist @entity316 of @entity318 's @entity317 said dinosaur body size evolved relatively quickly early on in their time on @entity183 as they invaded new ecological niches , but then slowed down among most lineages			0
the exception was the maniraptoran lineage that led to birds , @entity316 added			0
more than 1,000 species of dinosaurs have been identified but many are known from only fragmentary fossil remains			0
this study estimated the weight of every dinosaur whose remains are complete enough to contain the bones needed for the study 's formula , which is based on the relationship between the robustness of the limbs and the weight of the animal , the researchers said .			0

new species of titanosaur thought to be as heavy as 14 @entity146 elephants
@entity350 was 130 feet long and weighed 170,000 pounds
it beats the current record holder , @entity3
it was unearthed after chance discovery by farm worker in @entity69
the bones were initially discovered a year ago in the desert near @entity46
standing with its neck up , it was about 20 metres high – equal to a seven - *storey* *building*
