thousands of users of an online prescription service have had their data sold without their knowledge , a @entity5 investigation can reveal today			1
their names and addresses have been handed to companies that target the sick			2
many of the patients used the @entity14 service because they were disabled or too ill to travel to their nearest surgery			0
others used the firm ’s online doctor consultations			2
mps said the company was putting thousands of patients at risk and should face a police probe			1
the revelations come amid a growing outcry over the @entity5 ’s reporting on how sensitive medical and financial data is being sold to conmen and criminals			1
today we can also reveal that : following a major investigation , the @entity5 this week revealed how financial details of thousands of people – including details of their incomes , investments and pension pots – were being sold for as little as 5p to cold callers and fraudsters			1
the prescription company even gave the patients ’ email addresses , dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to firms and our disclosures yesterday included how undercover reporters were also able to buy private medical details – including names of people suffering from arthritis , diabetes , high blood pressure and even bladder problems – for just 19p each			1
some of this information on sick and disabled people is ending up in the hands of conmen and criminals who prey on the most vulnerable			1
now it can be revealed that details of @entity23 patients who have bought prescriptions online are also being offered for sale			1
the details sold to @entity80 by @entity14 , which has a turnover of £ 17million a year , include the names and addresses of people who have requested online doctor consultations using the site			1
on its website , @entity87 described those on the list as people who had used @entity14 to ‘ place their gp prescriptions and have them delivered to their home address ’			2
@entity97 , @entity98 's health spokesman , has described this as an ' extremely serious matter ' the details appear to have been passed on without the proper consent of patients			2
when registering for online prescriptions , patients using @entity105 have to agree to terms and conditions but these do not cover anything about their information being passed on to third parties			2
that is only stated in the small print of the website ’s privacy policy			0
@entity105 admitted to the @entity5 that it had sold the names and addresses of ‘ up to 5,000 ’ patients on three occasions , refusing to say how much it had charged			1
it said it had decided to stop selling the information and stressed no medical data had been passed on			1
but @entity97 , @entity98 ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ this is an extremely serious matter			0
the government must initiate an inquiry and call in the police to see if a crime has been committed			0
@entity105 should immediately be suspended as an approved distributor			0
‘ @entity129 has failed in his primary duty to protect vulnerable patients			2
he must make an urgent statement to set out how widespread this practice is , whether there have been other breaches and what action is being taken against @entity105			0
’ dr @entity137 , the outgoing @entity138 chairman of the health select committee , called for a criminal investigation into @entity105			2
she said : ‘ this is awful			0
it is just beyond belief that anyone working for this company could have thought it reasonable to sell these records			0
if people forward their prescriptions to a pharmacy they should never expect that to be anything other than totally confidential			0
‘ the ceo of this company should be personally held to account			0
did he know about this ? people should never use this online service again			0
‘ i just ca n’t see how this could be legal			0
it is a whole other level			0
i hope the police will investigate			0
’ @entity161 , a @entity138 member of the @entity163 health select committee , said : ‘ this is the most disgraceful breach of trust			0
‘ people access @entity23 services with an expectation that everything about it will be private			2
‘ patients would never expect that when using an @entity23 approved pharmacy service their details would then be sold on			1
the @entity5 ’s undercover team contacted @entity174 , which is run by mrs @entity175 , and found its selling sensitive pension details for as little as 19p ‘ this is putting our most vulnerable people at risk			1
it is a complete outrage and must stop immediately			0
’ @entity138 mp @entity181 , who sat on the health select committee , said the fact that @entity23 patients ’ details were sold on was ‘ incredibly concerning ’			1
she said that firms should not be selling data without ‘ people ’s explicit knowledge and their explicit consent			1
’ the @entity5 ’s revelations on the sale of medical and financial data have sparked a major inquiry by the office of the information commissioner , @entity197			1
@entity198 , a director of @entity199 , offered to sell details of 15,000 people to undercover reporters in a @entity5 expose this week yesterday mr @entity197 praised the @entity5 ’s investigation and rubbished the firms ’ claims that people ‘ opted in ’ to having their medical details sold on			1
he said : ‘ it ’s just beyond belief that people have signed up to be col called about their bladder problems			0
‘ what the @entity5 team appear to have discovered is that there ’s a nice little trade going between different commercial companies where our personal info has value to others			2
’ a spokesman for @entity14 said : ‘ only name and address information has been sold and no permission for any other data to be sold has been provided by @entity105			1
‘ @entity80 ( @entity226 @entity225 work for @entity105 under a strict agreement and other data was provided to them under that agreement for internal purposes , such as understanding the recency of the data , but not for sale to external parties			0
‘ this type of data processing for companies by their agencies is normal business practice			0
no medication information or data relating to medical conditions has been shared with @entity244 ’ @entity245 , managing director of @entity80 , said : ‘ we are an @entity247 registered company and are satisfied that the information held on this database complies with current data protection and @entity247 regulation			1
