@entity0 thinks @entity1 is no longer the world class goalkeeper he once was , and even says that @entity3 was right to drop the @entity5 captain during his time in the @entity8 capital			1
@entity9 captain @entity1 was at fault for two goals as @entity9 were routed 5 - 1 by @entity12 on friday and there were even questions as to whether @entity16 's @entity15 should replace him in goal for the world champions			1
and the 33 - year - old @entity5 man was caught out in the @entity22 final for @entity24 's opener that almost cost his club their @entity27 title in @entity28			0
last season under @entity41 he failed to regain his place - aside from in cup competitions - and now one of the game 's greats is questioning his ability			2
@entity0 , winner of 1986 @entity48 with @entity49 , told @entity50 that he felt the @entity5 stopper was no longer one of the top players in his position			1
@entity54 : @entity55 waltzed round @entity1 to score and he was at fault for two goals in the defeat ' he had the worst game i 've ever seen in my life , ' he said			0
' it reminds me of what my friend @entity3 told everyone about him			0
' he said @entity1 was n't the right keeper and he paid for that			0
he had to leave , but in the end it turns out that @entity3 was right			0
' despair : while @entity1 struggles to cope with the 5 - 1 defeat , the @entity72 players and fans celebrate smug : according to @entity0 , @entity3 was right all along about @entity1 ' ability as number one @entity3 , now back in @entity78 as @entity80 manager , quit real at the end of the 2012/13 season with his relationship with the players in tatters , according to reports in @entity9			1
but @entity0 's words and @entity1 ' decent performances in two of the biggest games of the season will leave the @entity93 boss feeling justified in his decision			2
@entity1 has been linked with a move to @entity96 this summer as he looks to re-establish himself as a first choice goalkeeper in @entity98			0
the boss : it remains to be seen whether @entity101 will follow @entity0 's advice waiting in the wings : @entity30 or @entity15 could take over if @entity1 is dropped by @entity9			1

@entity48 *legend* @entity0 believes @entity1 is no longer a top ' keeper
@entity1 let in five against @entity12 and was the chief *culprit* for two goals
@entity5 captain failed to regain a regular place under @entity41
despite a lack of playing time , @entity1 remains @entity9 's first choice ' keeper
@entity0 says @entity1 ' poor form proves @entity3 was right to drop him
