by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 8 august 2013 challenge : @entity2 will call for @entity3 to toughen his line on renegotiation with @entity6 @entity2 will challenge @entity3 to toughen his line on renegotiations with @entity6 by calling for the @entity9 to pull out of the single market altogether			1
up to 100 mps are expected to back a tough manifesto to be released in november by a new pressure group called @entity14			1
the group is run by leading @entity2 strategist @entity16 , who ran the @entity18 campaign against @entity20 proposals for electoral reform in 2011 and is widely expected to take the helm of a no campaign in an in - out referendum promised by mr @entity3 for 2017			1
in a challenge to the prime minister , who has so far refused to spell out in detail how he will approach a renegotiation with @entity6 , @entity29 will call for the @entity9 to be a member of a ‘ customs union ’ – an area with close trading ties but no more			2
their intervention will call on mr @entity3 to ditch support for the single market on the grounds that it creates much of the red tape that @entity9 businesses find so onerous			2
it would put @entity9 in a similar position to @entity44 and @entity45 , countries which both have access to @entity50 markets but are not forced to comply with every regulation from @entity6			2
@entity2 backbencher @entity52 said the prime minister should be encouraged rather than threatened by the plans since they would allow conservatives to vote to stay in the @entity50			2
he said : ‘ we ’ve been so fixated on the single market that people have not drawn the distinction between having market access and single market compliance			0
' this gives us a sense of what membership would need to be if we were to vote to stay in			0
it sets out quite an appealing vision			0
’ intervention : eurosceptics will call on mr @entity3 to ditch support for the single market mastermind : @entity2 strategist @entity16 is running the group of up to 100 mps ideas suggested by the government for the renegotiation so far – including a red card system for national parliaments to block unwelcome @entity50 plans – have not challenged the basis of @entity9 ’s role in the @entity50			1
the business for @entity9 manifesto will argue that the @entity9 is unlikely to be able to pick and choose which single market regulations it can keep and which it can ditch , so it would make more sense to pull out altogether			1
one source close to the project said : ‘ the manifesto will conclude that we should be in a customs union , not the single market			0
‘ what ’s important for @entity9 is to make sure there are no trade barriers with our @entity100 partners			0
the support from @entity2 mps is considerable			1
’ dozens of @entity103 have already given their private backing to the plans , which they see as returning to the @entity107 that @entity9 joined four decades ago			0
some @entity103 are also signed up to the group , which is backed by @entity109 , the millionaire businessman who is @entity111 ’s largest donor .			0
