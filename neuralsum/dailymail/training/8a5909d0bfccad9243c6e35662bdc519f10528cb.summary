the bobbleheads , which are given away for free rather than sold , are the work of law professor @entity13 , who has been creating them for the past 10 years			1
if you get a certificate to claim one , you have to redeem it at a @entity20 , law office			2

extremely rare bobblehead dolls of @entity8 justices , from left , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34 ' i think we take seriously trying to do them well , ' said @entity13 , a law professor at @entity39 's @entity38 and the editor of a quarterly legal journal called @entity42			1
subscribing to the journal is the most reliable way to get a voucher to claim a bobblehead when they are released , but there 's no guarantee			0
the certificates warn that the bearer ' might be able ' to exchange it for a bobblehead , and the journal also hands out some bobbleheads to non-subscribers , including law school public interest groups that auction them at fundraisers			1
some ultimately wobble their way onto @entity63 , where they reliably sell for hundreds of dollars			1
these bobblehead dolls representing @entity8 justices are some of the rarest ever produced and are given away for free , rather than sold the justices themselves seem to have been charmed by their caricatures			1

' thank you for the " bobble - head " likeness of me which now sits on the mantle of the fireplace in my chambers , ' @entity32 wrote			0
' it is probably a better likeness of me as i was 15 years ago than as i am now , but obviously i wo n't complain			2
' @entity13 said the idea for the bobbleheads came to him in the shower			1
in the decade since , he has immortalized 16 justices in ceramic , including four of the current court 's nine members			2
included in that total are a set of miniature bobbleheads representing the first justices appointed to the court			1
@entity13 , professor of law and editor of @entity42 , a law journal , holds one of the bobbleheads of @entity8 justices that he helped to design for @entity42 , in @entity20 @entity33 , right , once said in an interview that he understands his doll is the most popular , while @entity34 's figure stands on a replica of the parade ground at the @entity110 certificates for the newest tiny justice , @entity113 , recently went out			1
the dolls , which are produced by @entity116 , @entity20 - based @entity114 , are more than straight likenesses of the justices			0
each has multiple references to the legal legacy of the person it honors			1
for example , justice @entity124 rides a train , a nod to his important opinion in a case involving the @entity130 in @entity131			0
the @entity31 bobblehead plays a song by @entity134 , a group he mentioned in a copyright case			0
and @entity34 stands on a replica of the parade ground at the @entity110			0
in 1996 she wrote an opinion striking down the school 's all - male admissions policy			0
annotated sheets help collectors decode the details , which fans have been known to memorize and recite for visitors			0
if you get a certificate to claim one of these bobblehead dolls representing @entity8 justices , including @entity34 , center , you have to redeem it at a @entity20 , law office ' it 's like proof of their legal geekdom , ' said @entity158 , a @entity20 law firm partner and part of a small group of @entity42 editors who help create the bobbleheads			1
no detail is too small			0
justice @entity166 's bobblehead replicates the shoes she wore on sept. 25 , 1981 , the day she was sworn in as the court 's first female member			0
@entity170 stands on a @entity171 , a nod to his opinion in a copyright case involving the device			0
when the @entity175 was n't turning out right in production , @entity13 bought one on @entity63 and shipped it to @entity179 for a bobblehead sculptor to study			1
so far , @entity13 has gone through four drafts of the upcoming @entity70 bobblehead , which portrays @entity70 engaged in a favorite activity , riding his bike			1
the attention to detail delights devotees , who have been known to drive hundreds of miles to pick up their bobbleheads			2
and the figurines often are displayed in a prominent place in their owners ' offices			0
@entity194 , a federal judge in @entity195 , said she contemplated insuring her collection , especially since she got her @entity33 and @entity166 dolls signed by the justices			1
and @entity199 , a @entity200 law professor who collects the bobbleheads , says other faculty members have made ' veiled threats to steal them			1
' @entity204 , a former federal appeals court chief judge who now heads @entity205 , displays his collection in the school 's law library			2
the school is moving to a new building , and he says he plans a prominent spot for the dolls			0
@entity204 says he talks to @entity13 every so often just to make sure his subscription to @entity42 is paid up so he does n't miss an issue , or a bobblehead			2
' i do not want to miss one , ' he said .			0

law professor @entity13 has spent the past ten years creating a limited edition collection of bobbleheads celebrating past and present justices
