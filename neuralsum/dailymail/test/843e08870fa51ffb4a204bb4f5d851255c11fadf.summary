labour leader @entity0 has insisted he does not live in a ' mansion ' – despite admitting it is worth ' between £ 2million and £ 3million '			1
mr @entity0 said he would have to pay the proposed £ 250 a month ' mansion tax ' on homes worth more than £ 2million but claimed this did not mean he actually lived in one			1
the claim comes despite revelations that his four - storey @entity9 town house has two kitchens – including one for the family 's live - in nanny			1
the @entity26 leader was pictured with his wife @entity27 in their ' functional kitchenette ' instead of the much larger family kitchen downstairs			1
mr @entity0 , speaking on @entity31 's @entity32 show this afternoon , insisted his home was not a mansion			1
after confirming that he would be liable to pay the ' mansion tax ' he was asked whether he felt like he lived in a mansion			2
' no , but look , that 's just the term that 's used			0
' asked how he would pay for the £ 250 a month levy , mr @entity0 said : ' i 'll get it from my income – myself and @entity27			1
' and he declined to set out how much people with homes worth more than £ 3m would be paying as part of the levy			0
' there are about 100,000 homes we think in this area , that will be above £ 2m and the @entity49 has estimated that £ 1.2bn is a reasonable assumption to make from this			0
' we 've set out what the band will be between £ 2m and £ 3m - £ 250 a month , which is broadly speaking the top level of the council tax so in other words that 's the same again			2
' the precise figures above £ 3m will have to wait for when we get into government , precisely because we 've got to establish how many properties are in each band			0
' mr @entity0 said he would have to pay the proposed £ 250 a month ' mansion tax ' on homes worth more than £ 2million but claimed this did not mean he actually lived in one @entity63 , @entity0 's eldest son , tells the camera the family spartan kitchen is the ‘ best ’ in the £ 2.7million home kitchen sink dramas : @entity0 and his family in the kitchen that has caused so much controversy according to the property website @entity72 , mr @entity0 owns the most expensive home of any of the political leaders			1
his home in north @entity24 home value at £ 2.73million , up by more than £ 1million since 2010			0
by contrast mr @entity79 's house in @entity24 home would narrowly escape the mansion tax , being valued at £ 1.971million			1
mr @entity83 , who lives in @entity84 in south west @entity24 , would also escape with his home valued at £ 1.89million			2
@entity87 leader mr @entity86 is said to have a house in @entity89 worth a more modest £ 550,000 – still twice as expensive as the average home in the @entity91			2
under @entity26 's plan , people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge aimed at properties worth £ 2million or more			1
shadow chancellor @entity100 has promised to hike the levy for homes with over £ 10million , to ensure they make a ' significantly bigger contribution '			0
the £ 2million limit will rise in line with property prices , instead of inflation ' to ensure that more modest properties are not brought into the scope of the tax '			0
@entity26 has joined the @entity112 in promising an extra charge on expensive properties , to target rich homeowners – especially wealthy foreigners who buy up properties in @entity24			0
there will also be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings , but who live in an expensive home			0
the @entity112 used to argue in favour of a 1 per cent charge on the value of any home worth more than £ 2million , but there are concerns it would be difficult to implement .			0
