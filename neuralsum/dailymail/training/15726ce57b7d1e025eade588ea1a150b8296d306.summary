' i experienced something similar with @entity17 when we lost the @entity22 final against @entity18			2
it hurt - and the only cure was putting it right by lifting the trophy			0
' that is the only way we will get over the 2010 loss - by going one better this time			0

' dejected : @entity65 reflects on @entity17 's 2012 @entity22 loss to @entity18 redemption : @entity0 then scored the winner in the 2013 @entity22 final against @entity70 my precious : @entity0 says lifting the @entity2 would ease the pain , as did lifting the 2013 @entity22 @entity0 is also fully behind his coach , newly - appointed @entity74 manager @entity73 , who he believes can take them all the way in @entity7 before taking up the reins at @entity78			1
the former @entity18 star continued : ‘ he ( @entity73 ) has us a very organised team and playing well			0
