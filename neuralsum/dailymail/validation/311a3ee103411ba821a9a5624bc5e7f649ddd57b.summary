former @entity2 and @entity1 boss @entity0 says the @entity6 is n't what it once was @entity7 's @entity0 says the @entity6 now is ' probably the poorest i 've seen in a long , long time ' while @entity8 sides have flourished in @entity4 this season their @entity6 counterparts have struggled , with none left in the @entity23 or @entity24 after @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity2 bowed out this month			1
@entity0 said on @entity30 's @entity29 programme : ' it 's not been too long ago where we were looked at as probably having the best teams , and it does change			2
' @entity27 , @entity26 , @entity25 are all exceptional teams in their own right and they 'll be disappointed they went out , and maybe on another day they 'd have gone through			1
' it 's just becoming a wee bit of a habit that we 're not getting our teams quite as close to the final as we had in the past			0
