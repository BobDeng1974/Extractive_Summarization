for years , @entity0 was kept behind locked doors - painting the pictures of the wide - eyed waifs that made her husband @entity5 an art sensation			1
feted by celebrities during the 1950s and 60s , @entity5 , ever a showman , took credit for his wife 's work until @entity0 found the courage to come forward and tell the truth			1
her story is told in new movie @entity14 , which premieres tonight in @entity16			0
@entity17 plays @entity0 , while @entity18 is the controlling , egomaniac @entity5			1
both actors have won @entity23 nominations for their work			1
in a softly spoken voice , @entity0 , now 87 , tells @entity26 : ' i think @entity5 would have enjoyed every minute of it - all he cared about was being a celebrity , and of course , ' she muses : ' he would have just claimed he was an artist until the very end , he would have loved the attention			1
' with a soft chuckle , @entity0 says : ' i think @entity18 thinks he did the paintings now ! ' after viewing the movie , directed by @entity50 and produced by @entity51 , @entity0 admits : ' it was a very emotional experience , it was very traumatic to see it			1
' to see it so big and intensified , it was quite an experience			0
i cried and i laughed and then i cried again , i really was in shock for about two days afterwards			0
' my daughter had the same reaction , she was in shock too - it made it all come back alive to us			0
it was really emotionally overwhelming			0
' but , she says : ' it really is wonderful to have the whole truth come out and it 's very satisfying to have it really portrayed like it really happened			0
' locked up and forced to paint : although this november 1961 photo shows @entity5 and @entity0 busy painting actress @entity69 in her @entity71 home , they would divorce four years later and @entity0 would tell how she was locked up while @entity5 took credit for her work @entity74 : @entity18 and @entity17 as @entity5 and @entity0 in @entity14			1
@entity0 says : ' i think @entity5 would have loved it ... all he cared about was being a celebrity ' egotistical : @entity0 was awarded $ 4 million in court in 1986 - but has never seen a penny @entity0 met @entity5 in 1955 when he charmed her at an outdoor art exhibition in @entity82			1
divorced , with a daughter , they soon married - and soon @entity5 was passing off @entity0 's paintings of the sad children as his own , along with the story that they were based on youngsters he had seen in postwar @entity90 in 1946			1
one night , @entity0 accompanied her husband to @entity82 beatnik cub , @entity93 , where @entity5 sold the paintings as comics such as @entity96 and @entity97 performed on stage			1
when a customer asked her ' do you paint too ? ' she realized @entity5 was taking the credit for her work			2
staying with @entity5 for the sake of her daughter - while the paintings were printed on to postcards and posters sold in millions across @entity107 was kept a virtual prisoner in her own home while her husband frolicked in the pool outside - and brought other women into their bed			2
banned from having her own friends , she told @entity114 : ' the door was always locked , the curtains closed ... when he was n’t home he ’d usually call every hour to make sure i had n’t gone out			0
' he was always pressuring me to do more			0
' do one with a clown costume '			0
’ or : ‘ do two children on a rocking horse			0
' behind the smiles : @entity5 could not paint - but took credit for his wife @entity0 's portrayals of wide - eyed children that became beloved by celebrities			1
the couple are pictured in 1963 art elite : @entity132 , a granddaughter of the artist ( right ) joins actress @entity134 ( left ) at a @entity136 screening of @entity14 earlier this month feted : @entity137 ( left ) attends the screening of big eyes @entity5 , it must be said , could not paint , a fact @entity0 would seize upon , when finally in a court case in a 1986 - 21 years after they divorced - she was declared to be the true creator of the paintings			1
the verdict came only after a judge asked both @entity0 and @entity5 to paint in court			2
@entity5 claimed he had a sore shoulder and could not pick up a brush			2
@entity0 was awarded $ 4 million , but she never saw a penny of it as @entity5 , an alcoholic , had drunk his fortune away			1
a court psychologist diagnosed him with a rare mental condition called delusional disorder			0
@entity5 died in 2000 and making the decision to turn her life story and what was once so painful into a movie , was not an easy decision , @entity0 says			2
stars : director @entity50 , pictured left , with @entity17 , center , and @entity18 , right , was a big collector of @entity0 's work before he embarked on the project art world : @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity18 ' it was difficult			1
i turned down four or five other offers and then the writers @entity174 and @entity175 came to me and i trusted them to do it the way i wanted it done , and we started talking and i liked what they did			0
now a committed @entity180 , @entity0 - who has a cameo as a little old lady sitting on a park bench in @entity14 - says : ' i would like to think all our gifts and talents and abilities come from @entity188			0
' when i was married to @entity5 , i did rely on my faith , at that time i had n't yet become a @entity191 's witness , so i did n't know his name , but i knew there was a @entity188			0
' @entity0 still paints every day ' when i can ' at her home in @entity195 , @entity196			0
lonely : @entity17 as @entity0 alone in her studio			2
