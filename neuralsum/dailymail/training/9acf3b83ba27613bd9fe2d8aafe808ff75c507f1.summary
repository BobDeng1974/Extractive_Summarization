one of @entity1 's most successful spacecraft has gone gently into the silent night around the hottest planet in the solar system			0
since 2006 @entity5 had been studying the second world from the sun in unprecedented detail , revealing - among many discoveries - that the planet may still be geologically active			1
but @entity10 has revealed that the spacecraft has now run out of fuel , bringing to a close this flagship @entity1 mission - and leaving @entity15 without any spacecraft in orbit			1
@entity10 in @entity18 has confirmed that its @entity5 spacecraft ( illustrated ) has died			1
the probe had been orbiting @entity15 for eight years since 11 april 2006 - far exceeding its original planned lifetime of under two years			1
but it finally run out fuel during a series of daring atmospheric manoeuvres @entity5 was launched back on 9 november 2005 and arrived at @entity15 on 11 april 2006			1
it was one of the longest - serving spacecraft to orbit the planet , despite initial estimates for the mission expecting it to last not even two years			2
now it seems time has caught up with the spacecraft , though , as it has finally run out of fuel - which means contact can not be made with it any more , as its antenna can not be pointed towards @entity38			1
although it had far exceeded its planned life , scientists had recently been preforming a series of daring manoeuvres deep into the @entity15 atmosphere as the spacecraft ran out of fuel			1
@entity5 was launched back on 9 november 2005 and arrived at @entity15 on 11 april 2006			1
it then orbited @entity15 in an elliptical 24 - hour loop that began a distant 40,000 miles ( 66,000 km ) over the south pole , affording incredible global views			0
its orbit then took it to an altitude of just 155 miles ( 250 km ) above the surface at the north pole , close to the top of the planet ’s atmosphere , where it could observe and study the planet up close			0
each orbit , however , required more and more fuel to be spent as the spacecraft battled against radiation exerted from the sun to maintain its speed			0
in may , routine science operations of the spacecraft ceased , with efforts shifted to making lower passes through the atmosphere			0
from 18 june until 11 july so - called ‘ experimental aerobraking ’ took place , with the spacecraft ’s altitude gradually lowered			0
but now it has finally succumbed to these more extreme manouevres , having run out of fuel - meaning it can no longer position itself to communicate with @entity38			1
unlike cars and aircraft , spacecraft are not equipped with fuel gauges , so the time of propellant exhaustion for any satellite - especially after such a long time in space - is difficult to predict			0
however , while the end could not be predicted , it was not completely unexpected as it was known the spacecraft would be running low on fuel			0
full contact with @entity5 was lost on 28 november			0
since then some communications had been partially re-established , but they were very unstable and only limited information could be retrieved			0
without propellant , there is no chance of restarting communications			0
it is also impossible to raise the altitude further , meaning that the spacecraft will naturally sink deeper into the atmosphere over the coming weeks and ultimately burn up in the atmosphere of @entity15			1
' the available information provides evidence of the spacecraft losing attitude control most likely due to thrust problems during the raising manoeuvres , ' said @entity107 , @entity10 's @entity5 mission manager			1
' it seems likely , therefore , that @entity5 exhausted its remaining propellant about half way through the planned manoeuvres last month			2
' @entity112 , @entity10 's acting @entity5 spacecraft operations manager , added that they knew the spacecraft was ' running on fumes ' but they were pleased to push the boundaries ' right down to the last drop '			1
@entity5 can no longer re-position itself to communicate with @entity38			1
however , the mission was hugely successful , revealing that @entity15 ( shown ) may still be geologically active - and also revealing increasing wind speeds in its atmosphere over just six years in a few weeks the spacecraft will go out in a ' blaze of glory ' as it silently plunges into the @entity15 atmosphere ( illustration shown )			1
it ran out of fuel as it was performing lower and lower drops into the atmosphere in a bid to glean more science before the mission ended however , despite now coming to a conclusion end , the mission returned some key science in its eight years around the planet			2
' while the science collection phase of the mission is now complete , the data will keep the scientific community busy for many years to come , ' said @entity142 , @entity10 's @entity5 project scientist			1
@entity5 was not the first spacecraft to journey into the @entity15 atmosphere			1
that honour is bestowed to a series of @entity151 spacecraft in the 1960s , 70s and 80s called the @entity154 probes			0
about a dozen were sent on daring missions to the surface of @entity15 , with only a handful being successful			2
the intense heat and atmospheric pressure crushed each of the probes in up to about an hour once they had penetrated the atmosphere - but a few managed to survive long enough to return data and images			0
the @entity154 probes were succeeded by the @entity167 spacecraft , high - altitude balloons that were sent into the atmosphere of @entity15 on scientific missions			2
one highlight from the mission was the tantalising hint that the planet may still be geologically active today			2
a study found numerous lava flows that must have been created no more than 2.5 million years ago - just yesterday on geological timescales - and possibly even much less than that			0
and even though the conditions on the surface of @entity15 are extremely inhospitable today , a survey of the amount of hydrogen and deuterium in the atmosphere suggests that @entity15 once had a lot of water in the atmosphere , which is now mostly gone , and possibly even oceans of water like @entity38 's			2
studies of the planet 's ' super-rotating ' atmosphere - it whips around the planet in only four @entity38 - days , much faster than the 243 days the planet takes to complete one rotation about its axis - also turned up some intriguing surprises			0
when studying the winds , by tracking clouds in images , average wind speeds were found to have increased from roughly 185 to 250 mph ( 300 to 400 km / h ) over a period of six @entity38 years			0
at the same time , a separate study found that the rotation of the planet had slowed by 6.5 minutes since @entity207 's @entity206 measured it before completing its five - year mission at @entity15 20 years ago			2
however , it remains unknown if there is a direct relationship between the increasing wind speeds and the slowing rotation			0
a study using data from @entity5 found numerous lava flows that must have been created no more than 2.5 million years ago ( illustration of the @entity15 surface shown ) - just yesterday on geological timescales - and possibly even much less than that ' @entity5 has been part of our family of spacecraft in orbit since it was launched in 2005 , ' says @entity225 , @entity226			1
' it has been an exciting experience to operate this marvellous spacecraft in the @entity15 environment			0
the scientific success of the mission is a great reward for the work done by the operations teams and makes us more proud than sad in this moment of farewell			0
' and @entity238 , @entity239 , added : ' while we are sad that this mission is ended , we are nevertheless happy to reflect on the great success of @entity5 as part of @entity10 's planetary science programme and are confident that its data will remain important legacy for quite some time to come			2
' the mission has continued for much longer than its planned lifetime and it will now soon go out in a blaze of glory			1
