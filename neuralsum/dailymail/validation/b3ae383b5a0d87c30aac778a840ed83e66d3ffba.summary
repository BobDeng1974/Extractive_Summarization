@entity0 takes on @entity1 this weekend well aware of how desperate his old friend will be to put @entity5 's @entity4 disappointment behind them			1
@entity6 face the unenviable task of trying to stifle a @entity9 side not only chasing the @entity11 crown but wounded by wednesday 's @entity13 exit to @entity14			1
@entity5 failed to capitalise @entity16 's first - half sending off , with the 2 - 2 extra-time draw at @entity18 ending their hopes of a memorable treble			1
@entity0 says he is looking forward to facing old friend , @entity5 boss @entity1 this weekend @entity1 takes questions during his press conference at @entity5 's @entity26 training ground on friday striker @entity27 attempts an overhead kick during his side 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity14 at @entity18 @entity5 captain @entity31 tussles with @entity14 striker @entity16 during the @entity4 tie @entity5 players surround referee @entity34 as he prepares to send off @entity16 in the first - half it was not the first underwhelming @entity9 performance of late , but @entity0 does not expect such displays to necessarily work in @entity6 ' favour this weekend			1
' i do n't know when it 's a good time to face them , ' the @entity40 said			2
' it 's always a difficult time			2
' it 's a big team , a strong team with some great players and of course they are very disappointed after the last wednesday result			0
' if you play 60 minutes against 10 players , you do n't expect that final result and maybe a little bit more under pressure			0
' they fight after the @entity57 title and after that , not the most important one , they fight for the title			0
' they need a win after a disappointing result but they will give a reaction you normally expect as a manager			0
' ahead of this match , @entity1 brashly declared that @entity5 would win the @entity11 - the kind of comments @entity0 takes with a pinch of salt			1
the pair worked together under @entity74 at @entity75 in the late 1990s and retain a close relationship to this day			1
' i know him very well , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's a good friend and great coach and a very successful manager			2
' it was nice in our period in @entity75 and it 's always nice to meet @entity1 and we look forward			1
' when i was with @entity1 the assistant of @entity86 in @entity75 in ' 98 and ' 99 , it was a long time ago and it 's not always easy to know what will happen in the future			1
' at that time he was very ambitious as a coach and he had good coaches to see what he needs to be a successful coach			0
' @entity1 ( second from left ) and @entity0 ( far right ) worked together at @entity75 during the 1990s current @entity93 boss @entity74 ( far left ) was manager of @entity75 during this time @entity6 right - back @entity94 skips over the challenge of @entity97 forward @entity98 @entity97 striker @entity99 is challenged by @entity6 defender @entity100 at @entity101 's man management is key to @entity1 's success , so too that @entity0 is enjoying this season			1
saints have tailed off slightly recently but returned to winning ways against @entity97 last time out , before making the most of a 10 - day break by jetting off on a mid-season jaunt			0
@entity0 took this side on a bonding trip to snowy @entity113 , foregoing sun loungers and training for @entity117 skiing and ice hockey			2
' i saw some players skating and i do n't think it was good for their confidence , ' @entity0 said , smiling			2
' it was something totally different and we choose @entity127 because of the relationship between @entity6 and @entity113 - @entity129 ( @entity130 ) the owner and the chairman is there			2
' it was totally different to lying on the beach on @entity136			0
if they like to go to @entity136 , they can go in the summer			0
' we did some activities which was great , some players were skeptical before going but everybody was happy with what we did			0
' it was a good week but playing football is totally different			0
' always you know if you stay together the whole day and do some different activities there is more time to talk			0
' players had free time and you see characters of players , difficulties , but they did a great job because they achieve everything what we did and it was a great atmosphere over there			0
' @entity0 recently took his @entity6 players on a skiing trip to bond in @entity113 @entity6 's @entity164 striker striker @entity165 takes a tumble while skiing in @entity113 @entity167 said the trip had brought the squad together and taken some of the stress of the season away @entity6 's players during their recent trip to the @entity175 over the @entity176 weekend			1
