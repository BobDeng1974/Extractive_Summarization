@entity0 handed trainer @entity1 a remarkable ninth win in the @entity3 at @entity4 as he dismantled the opposition with a display of clinical and ruthless steeplechasing			1
the 15 - 8 favourite ’s former stablemate @entity10 , a five - time winner of this race and honoured with the unveiling of a statue before racing , produced some brilliant @entity17 displays			1
this was a performance of utter control by @entity0 which would have been worthy of @entity10			1
@entity21 celebrates his victory on @entity0 in the @entity3 trainer @entity1 celebrates his victory with @entity0 in the @entity3 @entity0 secured victory in the @entity25 at @entity4 on @entity17 @entity21 ’s mount jumped with fluency and galloped relentlessly as he drew four - and - a - half lengths clear of @entity29 and a further five from stablemate @entity30 to win the race for a second year running			1
that duo , along with @entity33 ( fourth ) , @entity34 ( fifth ) and @entity35 ( sixth ) , were all queuing up on @entity0 ’s tail as the field turned into the home straight			1
but they had nothing left to give			2
the dual @entity43 winner had drawn the sting out of them all , like a boxer who pummels his opponent with a repetitive jab on the chin			2
the performance made a mockery of the promoter ’s not unreasonable efforts to build up this £ 200,000 contest watched by a crowd of almost 22,000 as one of the most open @entity3 ’s ever run			1
the victory also enabled the eight - year - old to join an illustrious list of horses to have won back - to - back @entity3 ’s , including @entity61 , captain @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity0 followed up last year ’s win with a fourth place in the @entity69 and @entity1 ’ aim is now to win that race — a feat he feels would truly place the gelding ’s name up with the chasing glitterati			1
trainer @entity1 horse raced to a second consecutive victory at the race @entity0 ridden by @entity21 on their way to victory in the @entity81 @entity3 he also has confidence he can achieve the feat having identified , and cured , the attack of chronic gastric ulcers which he feels were hampering @entity0 , jointly owned by @entity86 and @entity87 , last season			1
@entity1 , who up until the @entity3 had endured a frustrating day with @entity89 falling in the @entity90 ’ @entity3 and @entity91 pulling up in the @entity92 , said : ‘ i think this was a career - best effort			1
i think he is a better horse than he was a year ago			2
he is a bit stronger			0
‘ the @entity69 is now our no 1 target with him			0
i know why he did n’t perform last year — a few little things that we have put right			2
we found out he was suffering from gastric ulcers and the cheek - pieces have helped him concentrate a bit more			0
‘ if we can get him therein this form we have a big chance			0
’ @entity21 added : ‘ i think he ’s proved what a very good horse he is , whatever the ground			0
he did it the hard way , he went a real good gallop and picked it up from the bend			0
he ’s just a hell of a good horse			0
’ on his own record , @entity1 added : ‘ i ’ll have to go for 10 and make it a round number			2
i am astounded — it is incredible			0
it shows we have a good team at home			0
we are good with these staying chasers			0
our set - up suits well			0
hopefully , @entity0 will come back next year			1
’ @entity3 sponsors @entity81 make @entity0 7 - 2 favourite for the @entity69 , having halved his odds			1
the next two in the betting , @entity124 ( 10 - 1 ) and reigning champion @entity125 ( 12 - 1 ) , run in tomorrow ’s @entity126 at @entity127			0
@entity0 is 5 - 1 to win the @entity3 for a third time next year			1
the two - mile @entity129 seems the more likely target for @entity30 after he finished third for a second year running under @entity131			1
@entity1 added : ‘ i would love to run @entity30 in the @entity129			1
i think he has all the speed in the world			0
it amazed me he stayed on to be third because he looked beat turning in			0
his class gets him there			0
’ and it seems likely @entity29 will try to win a second @entity138 over two miles and five furlongs rather than go for the three and a quarter mile @entity69			2
trainer @entity142 said : ‘ he ’s run his heart out			2
i ’m sure he ’ll have entries in both races at @entity146 ( @entity138 and @entity69 ) , but i ’d rather win a @entity138 than be placed in a @entity69			0
’ one wonders if the @entity138 will also be the target of @entity33 after his stamina also looked to be running on empty in the final furlong .			2

trainer @entity1 lands ninth @entity3 victory
favourite @entity0 wins race for the second year running
@entity29 finished second with @entity30 third
