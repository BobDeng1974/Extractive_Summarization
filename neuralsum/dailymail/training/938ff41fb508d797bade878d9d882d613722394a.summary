the latest claims come after mr @entity1 revealed in the @entity23 last week that he was aware of five investigations dropped by @entity25 into alleged @entity27 child abuse which took place over the last three decades			1
last night the @entity30 mp said : ‘ there are at least five paedophile rings which involved mps			1
@entity34 of them involved at least one mp , some involved more , and these were groups of people who knew about the activities of one another			2
‘ in some cases i believe they committed abuse together			0
’ he told the @entity44 : ‘ three of these figures were highly influential			0
’ the document submitted to police by mr @entity1 also includes the names of 13 ex-ministers , including at least two who are claimed to have gone to ‘ abuse parties ’ held at @entity53 , the luxury riverside estate in @entity54 which has been home to dozens of mps			1
mr @entity1 acted after receiving hundreds of reports from the public			1
last month the @entity23 revealed how in 1989 as a young councillor in @entity60 , @entity61 , mr @entity1 uncovered evidence that a @entity64 cabinet minister was allegedly involved			1
he alerted police but was told three months later that the inquiry was being shelved on the orders of ‘ those at the top ’			0
now mr @entity1 has compiled ‘ credible ’ information about 22 high - profile figures alleged to have committed offences between 1970 and the late - 1990s			1
mr @entity1 told the @entity23 : ‘ all of these allegations are historic but some of these people are still in positions of power , having been local councillors or mps at the time			1
the offences span almost 30 years			0
‘ but i am still getting more information coming into me			0
’ he added : ‘ all those 22 names are worthy of investigation by the police			2
the evidence against half of them is very compelling			0
missing : last month , it emerged another dossier , which named mp @entity110 ( pictured ) as being involved in abuse , had vanished ‘ some of them could definitely be prosecuted and i believe several of them were definitely child abusers			2
’ he told the @entity115 : ‘ some of these victims have been ignored for years by the police and the @entity80 really needs to step up to the mark now and do a proper job			0
’ mr @entity1 also said he had received allegations that an organised crime gang and a celebrity were involved in the trafficking of young boys to abusers at @entity53			1
but many of the reports were never investigated at the time			0
@entity80 deputy assistant commissioner @entity79 has confirmed he is now assessing mr @entity1 ’s dossier as part of a raft of allegations that police acted inappropriately in relation to child abuse investigations covering a period from the mid- 1970s up to 2005			1
@entity25 last week made a dramatic appeal for witnesses to three alleged child murders carried out by the @entity11 paedophile ring , describing claims that a @entity110 mp strangled a boy of 12 as ‘ credible and true ’			2
an expert panel set up in july to look into historical child abuse is poised to be scrapped after being beset by problems , including the resignation of two chairmen			2
home secretary @entity148 has told its eight members that a new body will be established with more powers			0
@entity153 , who runs a children ’s charity and is on the panel , said : ‘ halting the inquiry would send a very negative message to so many people who we have promised they can have confidence in us to do the right thing			0
’ last month , it emerged that another dossier compiled by mp @entity165 had vanished after being sent in 1983 to the then home secretary @entity166			0
