@entity0 says @entity1 is in flying form as it emerged that the @entity4 ’s @entity3 hopeful could have been given a big advantage by the handicapper			1
trained by @entity7 , @entity1 — last seen when impressively winning the @entity8 at @entity9 in february — was among 74 horses after the latest forfeit stage for the @entity13 showpiece on april 11			1
@entity14 , the 2014 @entity15 winner trained by @entity16 , heads the weights on 11st 10lb , but @entity1 could have 9lb in hand			2
@entity0 rides @entity1 to victory in the @entity20 at @entity9 @entity0 poses with his ride and trainer @entity7 ( right ) after winning at @entity9 @entity0 schooled the nine - year - old at @entity7 ’ ditcheat base on monday as preparations stepped up a gear , while @entity27 — the 8 - 1 ante - post favourite — was put through his paces at @entity29 under @entity30			1
while public sentiment will be with @entity30 for the big race , @entity31 , the @entity33 ’s @entity32 , warns that dangers to @entity37 lurk all around , not least from @entity1 , who is available at 12 - 1			1
champions jockey @entity30 exercises ante - post favourite @entity27 at @entity29 @entity31 said : ‘ @entity1 was very impressive when he won at @entity9			1
if i was framing the weights now , i ’d have him 9lb higher			2
i ’d also have @entity40 ( a winner at the @entity42 ) 10lb higher			0
’ @entity1 will be one of six bullets that @entity7 aims at the £ 1million race , which he won in 2012 with @entity46 , and the horse has been trained with @entity13 in mind — he finished fifth 12 months ago to @entity49 @entity0 added of the gelding , who has run only three times this season : ‘ fingers crossed , the horse seems to be in good order			1
hopefully he ’ll get there in one piece			0
i schooled him and he was very good			0
he did it well at @entity9 and let ’s hope he ’s ahead of the handicapper			1
@entity0 believes @entity62 has a good chance of winning the big race at @entity13 ‘ when he ran in the @entity66 ( in november and was pulled up ) it was really bad ground and i would just write that run off altogether			1
we have to go to @entity13 with an open mind			2
’ as for @entity49 , his trainer dr @entity71 could require a new jockey as the veteran chaser bids to become the first horse since @entity75 in 1974 to win back - to - back @entity76			2
@entity77 , who did the steering a year ago , could be claimed to ride many clouds			0
@entity71 said : ‘ i might have a few calls to make			0
it is @entity77 ’s ride if he is available			0
it is pointless getting worried at this stage			0
i ’m sure there will be a few interested jockeys if @entity77 is n’t available			0

@entity1 impressively won the @entity8 at @entity9 , february
jockey @entity0 believes the gelding could have been given an advantage by the handicapper ahead of the @entity13 *showdown*
@entity30 and @entity27 will get public vote at @entity3
