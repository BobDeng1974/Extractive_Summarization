@entity0 missed a short putt at the last as he fell short in his bid to win a first title in two years at the @entity4			1
the 38 - year - old had a 6ft putt to force a play - off with @entity9 ’s @entity8 , but pulled it left of the target			1
while @entity0 will be forced to reflect on a third - round 75 that wrecked a good week , @entity12 now only needs to turn up at the season ’s finale next week to claim the race to @entity16			1
none of which will be a consolation to @entity0 , his @entity43 team - mate			1
@entity0 got off to a blistering start to the tournament and opened a six - shot lead with rounds of 64 and 66 at the end of a poor season			1
but he was brutal in assessment of a ‘ c * * p ’ third round and could not quite match @entity8 ’s fast finish , despite shooting a 67			1
@entity8 had appeared to wobble in the finish two holes , first with an iron into deep rough next to the 17th green and then by driving into trees at the last			2
but each time he recovered for par and a seven - under round of 65 , meaning @entity0 needed to birdie the par five 18th to force a play - off			1
@entity35 went into the final round as @entity12 's only realistic challenger in the race to @entity16 but after finishing on 12 under revealed he dislocated a rib while stretching before his final - round 71			1
@entity12 , holding the 2014 player of the trophy , has sealed a second race to @entity16 win @entity12 's ' best ever year ' include victories at @entity72 ( above ) , @entity73 and the @entity43 he said : ' i went in the gym this morning at 7am and warmed up , and then we did a bit of stretching - something i have n't done for a year now because of my surgeries			1
i could n't really do it , and dislocated my rib			0
i thought i ca n't even tee it up			0
' then my physio tried to crack it back in , did n't work and we went so see the chiropractor and they pushed it back in			0
i had like 1,600 milligrams of @entity89			0
i could n't have a proper back swing			0
' @entity12 , who won two majors in 2014 , said : ' this has obviously been the best season of my career by a long way , and to win the race to @entity16 for the second time really is something truly special			1
that four - week spell over the summer , from @entity72 to the @entity73 , would have to be the best golf of my life , so i feel like i ’ve really earned the race to @entity16			1
' winning it for the first time two years ago was a fantastic feeling , but i feel like i ’m now a more complete player and my all - round game has moved to another level			2
i ’ve put in a lot of hard work this season , with my game and my fitness , so it ’s nice to get the rewards at the end of it			2
@entity35 's chance of challenging @entity12 in the race to @entity16 was effectively ended by a dislocated rib @entity0 heads to @entity16 without any pressure and hoping to end his season on a high ' in some ways the pressure is off next week , but i ’ll fight very hard to end the year on a high with another victory			1
i ’ve a great record in this tournament , and in @entity16 generally , having secured my first @entity124 win there in 2009			2
' @entity0 said : ' it 's a disappointing outcome			2
i think hats off to a great final round , and obviously he ( @entity8 ) has played some superb golf there			2
the damage was done on saturday			0
that , for me , is really disappointing ; to have played three great rounds of golf , and just one blip on saturday , is a real shame			0
' so you know , it 's frustrating			0
it is what it is			0
there 's no other word for it			0
yes , i 'm going to be angry			0
i 'll be angry for a good few days			0
i 'll keep myself in my own little room and have a little chat with myself and come out and win next week			0
