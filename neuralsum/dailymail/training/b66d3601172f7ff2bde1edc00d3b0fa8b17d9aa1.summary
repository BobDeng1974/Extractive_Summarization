he then gripped and shook her , causing her to lose consciousness while still in his arms			0
the little girl - who had successfully overcome a premature birth at 34 weeks - died five days later			2

today , at @entity22 , he was also sentenced to 18 months to run concurrently after pleading guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm in an earlier attack on @entity1 months earlier			2
the child 's mother @entity25 , 20 , from @entity27 , was also sentenced to nine months in jail , suspended for 12 months			1
she was convicted of allowing @entity1 's death at the hands of her ex-partner			1
sentencing , judge @entity32 said @entity0 was a ' violent and unpredictable ' man , who had issues with anger management and @entity35 , for which he took medication			2
addressing the defendant , he said : ' what undoubtedly , @entity0 , you had done in that moment was to twist @entity1 's legs in such a way so violently as to fracture the left femur and right tibia , gripping and shaking her so violently you caused catastrophic brain injury so that bleeding began and led to her very quickly losing consciousness			1
' it was an extremely violent assault , from which she never recovered			0
' he added that @entity0 ' must have been aware how badly ' he hurt his daughter			2
during the hearing , the court heard how @entity1 's injuries were so serious that the first paramedic on the scene described her as looking ' completely dead and lifeless '			1
the court heard how @entity0 also ' knew immediately ' what he had to his daughter , but offered no indication as to what had happened			2
it was only after @entity1 's death that a post mortem discovered the tell - tale internal injuries he had inflicted on the vulnerable baby on that occasion			1
he later sought to blame @entity25 ' parents for the initial attack , the court was told			2
the little girl ( pictured left and right ) was left with catastrophic brain injuries , eight broken ribs and fractures in both legs following the ' violent ' assault at the house in @entity7 , @entity8 judge @entity32 said @entity1 was ' a baby who had been fine , and in many ways thriving ' but had ' suddenly collapsed '			1
the judge praised the medical care at both the @entity81 , @entity27 , and later @entity82 as swift and professional			0
but he said that , from the moment of @entity0 's violent outburst , his daughter had been left ' effectively dead ' and nothing could be done to save her			1
life support for the little girl was withdrawn and she died five days later			2
the judge added that violent assault was the result of a ' sudden extreme loss of temper ' , but whether born of ' anger or exasperation ' there was still intent to cause harm			0
judge @entity32 also said he accepted that @entity25 , who the court heard raised her own siblings , was ' a good mother '			0
he accepted evidence in court from both social and healthcare workers that she was ' skilled ' and competent			0
@entity1 's mother @entity25 ( pictured with @entity1 ) was also handed a nine - month jail term , suspended for 12 months , for allowing the death of her daughter but he said he could not square the ' truly remarkable imbalance ' of her fine ability as a mother with her apparent failure to share concerns about @entity0 with the hospital doctors and police			1
it was only when a friend in whom @entity25 had confided threatened to tell police about her suspicion @entity0 had carried out the fatal attack , that she ' hinted ' her fears to police , the court heard			1
judge @entity32 told @entity25 : ' at the heart of what is worse is what you did throughout what followed ( the fatal assault )			0
you lied to doctors and police about what you knew or suspected			0
' @entity0 , who also has a mild form of @entity130 's , had sat impassively as the judge spoke			0
as his sentence was passed down he started chewing the inside of his mouth and looked across at @entity25			0
yesterday in court , @entity0 was described by the prosecution as a manipulative man who had threatened @entity25 with suicide if she ever left him			1
the court heard @entity0 ( pictured left and right ) , who pleaded guilty to manslaughter , ' knew immediately ' what he had done to his daughter but did not reveal any information to paramedics or police in evidence , the court heard how he had attacked her in public on at least two occasions , once grabbing her throat and hair in front of friends			1
@entity157 for the @entity158 said @entity0 ' had little or no part ' in the care of his baby girl , adding ' it is clear @entity25 did not trust @entity0 with the care of @entity1 '			1
he spoke of a text @entity25 had sent a friend in which she described an incident at the family home where @entity0 had nearly accidentally struck his daughter			2
mr @entity158 said the young couple 's relationship was stormy and they had once broken up , before being reconciled when @entity25 learned she was pregnant with @entity1			1
the judge said it seemed clear @entity1 ' did not take to her father '			0
he also made it clear that health and social workers , as well as @entity0 's relatives , had done everything to offer support to the young family			0
he added that it was an aggravating factor that the attack happened ' in spite of and in the face of ' that assistance			0
@entity187 reported hearing a row in the family home on the morning of the fatal assault			0
a later one - second phone call made to 999 from @entity25 ' phone was never explained by either parent			0
it was an hour - and - a - half after that phone call that @entity25 rang for an ambulance , saying her baby had suddenly collapsed			0
the judge accepted from hearing the call 's recording , she was ' plainly a mother in real distress '			0
judge @entity32 said a letter of apology from @entity0 expressed his ' sense of loss ' , but needed to be weighed against another letter he had written to a female girlfriend while in prison in which he had attempted to shift the blame for the killing onto others			0
@entity0 was convicted in august last year of sexual activity with a 14 - year - old girl , and of causing a child to engage in sexual activity , for which he was sentenced to six months in custody .			2
