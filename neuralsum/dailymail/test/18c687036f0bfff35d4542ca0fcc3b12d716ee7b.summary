a two - year - old girl who died from a brain tumour has been frozen - in the hope she will one day be revived by advances in science			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , is thought to be the youngest person ever cryogenically preserved			1
the toddler was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer last april after she failed to wake up one morning , @entity9 's @entity8 reports after being admitted to a @entity15 hospital , tests revealed she had a 11cm tumour in the left side of her brain			1
the outlook was bleak from the start - the disease has a five - year survival rate of 30 per cent			1
to make matters worse , @entity5 - known to her family as @entity30 - had fallen into a coma			1
after a months of intensive treatment , including 12 rounds of brain surgery , 20 chemotherapy treatments , and 20 radiation therapy sessions , it became clear there was little more doctors could do			0
she died on january 8th this year after her parents switched off her life support machine			1
by the time she passed away , she had lost 80 per cent of the left side of her brain - essentially paralysing the right side of her body			1
but determined for some good to come from her death , her family have had her body cryogenically preserved - by one of the biggest providers of this service in the world			1
@entity5 is currently at the @entity54 - based @entity53 , her brain and body frozen separately at @entity57			1
her family 's main - although many would argue , far fetched - hope is that one day , science will have progressed enough to restore life to her			1
alternatively , her parents want the cells from her brain and other parts of her body to be saved , so the disease that killed her can be studied in the future			1
aside from the huge number of ' what ifs ' , there is the cost			0
' membership ' to @entity53 costs $ 770 a year - plus a rather more hefty $ 80,000 for a ' neuro ' ( the procedure @entity5 had ) or £ 200,000 to have a full body frozen			1
@entity53 is also where the bodies of famous baseball player @entity76 , as well as his son @entity77 , are stored			1
' it [ the freezing ] provides the opportunity for @entity5 to breathe again when the technology is provided and appropriate for her disease , ' said her father , who found out about the cryopreservation firm on the internet			1
the procedure involves moving the patient onto an ice bed , coating them in freezing materials and artificially restarting the heart with a “ heart - lung - resuscitator "			0
over a dozen different medications are administered before blood is drained from the body and replaced with medical - grade antifreeze ,			1
the chest cavity is then opened to attach the major blood vessels to a machine that flushes out all remaining blood , then slowly lowering the body ’s temperature , at a rate of 1 ˚ celsius every hour			0
after two weeks , the body reaches deep cryofreeze at -196 ˚ @entity107 but as a family of doctors , they are hopeful , rather than unrealistically optimistic			2
and as @entity5 's doctor pointed out : ' her life was made possible by modern science in the first place - she was carried by a surrogate because her mother had lost her uterus birthing a son			1
' the family also feels there are ' still considerable frontiers left to be examined when it comes to medicine and human physiology			0
' they did n't want their daughter 's life to end in vain , ' @entity125 , @entity53 's medical response director told @entity9			2
' they 're hoping that by preserving the tissue cells of this particular cancer , they can come up with a better treatment plan , and maybe even eventually cure it			0
if you look at the global picture of what they 're trying to accomplish , it 's very altruistic			0
' but the process of cryogenically freezing the toddler was n't just an emotional rollercoaster , but a logistical one , too			0
in an ideal world , she would have been flown to @entity54			2
but @entity5 's health was so poor and when she ended up on a ventilator , air travel became impossible			2
instead , a doctor from @entity53 flew to @entity6 and , as soon as she was pronounced dead - at 6.18pm on that january evening - preservation of her body began			1
@entity5 is currently at the @entity54 - based @entity53 , her brain and body frozen @entity155 family 's main - although many would argue , far fetched - hope is that one day , science will have progressed enough to restore life to her usually , the brain would be removed from the body and then frozen			1
but customs and repatriation issues to the @entity164 meant it was easier , according to mr @entity125 , to undertake cryoprotective perfusion of @entity5 ’s brain in @entity6			1
' the team decided to do so without separating her brain from the rest of the body , ' he said			2
the procedure ' involves moving the patient onto an ice bed , coating her in freezing materials and artificially restarting the heart with a “ heart - lung - resuscitator "			0
over a dozen different medications are administered before blood is drained from the body and replaced with medical - grade antifreeze ,			2
@entity53 's mission , according to the company website , is as follows ... ' the preservation of individual lives , to be sought through the following prioritized list of fundamentals : maintain the current patients in biostasis			2
place current and future members into @entity191 ( when and if needed )			0
eventually restore to health and reintegrate into society all patients in @entity53 's care			2
fund research into developing more cost effective and reliable means for 1 - 3 above			2
provide public education as a means of fostering growth to support the goals of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 above			0
' so far , the company has performed over 130 cryopreservations			0
the chest cavity is then opened to attach the major blood vessels to a machine that flushes out all remaining blood , then slowly lowering the body ’s temperature , at a rate of 1 ˚ celsius every hour			0
after two weeks , the body reaches deep cryofreeze at -196 ˚ @entity107 @entity5 underwent a procedure called a ' neuro '			1
this is where the the brain is removed and stored , rather than the whole body			2
it is now sitting in a stainless steel , vacuum - insulated container in @entity54 filled with liquid nitrogen at -196 ˚ @entity107 but the question still remains as to how - if science did eventually progress enough - any frozen body would actually be revived			1
' we know we can regenerate a small organ , and grow a new heart , ' said mr @entity125			0
' we know we can 3 - dimensionally print cells and hearts			0
so at some point we would need to regenerate her entire body , or at least her organs , and put it all together			0
' then we ’d need to transplant that brain into a new body			2
' however a growing number of people are showing interest in the pioneering technology			0
' our market is growing , ' mr @entity125 told @entity9 's @entity8			0
' the younger generation is more accustomed to seeing changes in technology			0
any thing you can come up with , six months later , there ’s an app for it			0
' the younger generation sees this and thinks ‘ sure why not ’ ? - they can figure everything else out , so why not this ? they feel this is kind of an inevitable thing			0
' and for @entity5 's family , it provides peace of mind and gives them some solace from the tragedy of her death			1
' at least , we devoted her life and body for the progress and development of science , ' said her mother , @entity273			0
' this is also another treat for our family , we know that she 's alive although we have been separated			0

two - year - old @entity5 , from @entity6 , died in january
had *battled* a very rare brain cancer that affects very young *children*
her brain and body have been frozen by @entity54 - based firm @entity53
family hopes body can be used for research - or she can one day live again
