@entity0 have accepted a £ 3million bid from @entity2 for superkid @entity3			1
the 18 - year - old is set to fly out for talks with the @entity8 giants and the deal is expected to be concluded later this week			1
the teenage midfielder became known as “ @entity11 ” for his dazzling dribbling and low centre of gravity as he tormented @entity16 defences when he burst onto the scene last season as @entity0 finished fourth in the @entity19 and reached the @entity20			1
moving abroad : @entity0 's @entity3 , second left , was on great form last season over the past year , @entity3 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , has been scouted by @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
and while @entity0 were not under pressure to sell they felt unable to turn down a bid of that size for a teenager			1
last season , the down - to - earth @entity3 played down comparisons with the @entity37 great but revealed he would love to play abroad one day rather than grace the @entity38			1
‘ the comparison to @entity11 is quite laughable , but it is good to read , ’ he said			1
‘ i look up to @entity11 because he ’s the best in the world			2
every young boy should be watching and trying to emulate him in training			0
do n’t be an ordinary person , go and try something special			0
‘ growing up , i watched the @entity48 leagues and prefer that style			0
getting the ball down and being patient with the build - up play			2
in @entity53 , it ’s maybe more direct			0
if you are a winger , you are expected to take on a full - back and get a cross in			0
abroad , you can turn out , keep the ball and just keep the attack going			0
you also see players who are smaller in stature			0
@entity60 scores a brace for @entity0 so skillful : @entity62 has been in exceptional form for @entity64 during the @entity65 ‘ in @entity53 , it ’s more athletes			2
being a smaller guy , i need to think about what ’s best for me and what ’s best around me and i think being abroad is the best culture of football for me			0
” @entity3 and his close friend , the @entity0 defender @entity73 – who was the subject of a failed £ 600,000 bid by @entity75 last season - were both coached intensively as kids by @entity79 at his respected @entity81 soccer clinics			1
when @entity79 was promoted by then - @entity0 boss @entity82 to head of the @entity85 youth academy at the age of 22 , he fast - tracked the pair for future stardom before the highly - rated @entity79 quit his post with the @entity90 for a role in the backroom staff at @entity95 club @entity93 it seems likely @entity79 will have given a glowing recommendation about @entity3 to @entity2 when they were doing background checks on the young @entity99			1
former @entity2 star : @entity101 played for the @entity8 side before moving to @entity27 @entity3 's former football coach : it 's likely @entity79 will have given a glowing recommendation about the teenager to @entity2 when they were doing background checks on the young @entity99 @entity79 said recently he was in in no doubt that @entity3 ’s ability would enable him to succeed on the continent			2
‘ his movement , awareness and technical ability are all outstanding , ’ @entity79 said			0
‘ he is already playing in a way that can break down @entity116 teams and allow him to play in @entity116 leagues			0
' now @entity3 looks set to seal a stunning move to @entity2 .			2

18 - year - old has been *dubbed* ' @entity11 ' for his dazzling dribbling
