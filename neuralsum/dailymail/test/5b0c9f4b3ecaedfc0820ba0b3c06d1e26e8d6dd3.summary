even after offering so little on the pitch , @entity0 still served a useful purpose for his manager on sunday			1
he drew the attention away from the cold reality of a disappointing display against @entity7 ; away from the fact that @entity10 ’s chances of now qualifying for the @entity11 appear extremely remote			1
if there was a danger @entity12 might have to endure some less than flattering headlines , @entity0 at least offered an alternative			1
@entity0 was captain for @entity10 in the @entity18 match against @entity7 at @entity19 @entity10 striker @entity0 became the youngest @entity18 player to be captain this season at the age of 21 years and 251 days @entity10 went into the @entity18 match looking to get back into the race for @entity11 qualification after @entity28 's loss @entity7 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity29 6 ; @entity30 7 , @entity31 7 , @entity32 7 , @entity33 6.5 ; @entity34 7.5 , @entity35 6.5 , @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 7 ; @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 7 ( @entity40 76 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 booked : @entity30 , @entity33 goals : none manager : @entity51 7 @entity10 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 6 ( @entity54 47 , 6 ) , chiriches 6 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 6 , @entity58 6.5 ( @entity59 83 ) ; @entity60 6.5 ( @entity61 64 , 6 ) , @entity62 7 , @entity63 5 ; @entity0 6 subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 booked : none goals : none manager : @entity12 6 @entity72 : @entity34 referee : @entity74 5 attendance : 18,829 how the @entity18 table looks @entity0 's heat map vs @entity7			1
click for more @entity0 had a bad day at the office by his recent high standards : 0 shots on target by @entity0			2
the last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the @entity18 was on december 6 against @entity83			1
14 @entity0 made just 14 passes , the joint lowest of any @entity10 starter			1
56 % @entity0 's pass completion rate was the worst of any @entity10 player except goalkeeper @entity52			1
in fairness to @entity12 , this would not have been in his thinking when he selected @entity92 as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top - four place would now be difficult			1
but the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21 - year - old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance @entity0 and his colleagues had just produced			1
seemingly miffed by the line of questioning , @entity12 ’s only explanation for why he made @entity0 the youngest skipper in the @entity18 this season was brief and to the point			1
‘ he deserved it , ’ he said , and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room			0
but @entity12 did not stop there , accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine @entity0 as club captain			1
‘ he has the quality , ’ he said			0
‘ so yes , maybe ( he could be captain in the long term )			0
’ right now anything would appear possible with this kid			0
the goal only 78 seconds into his @entity127 debut ; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first @entity10 striker since @entity131 to score 30 in a season			1
perhaps he will be hosting @entity133 next week			0
here at @entity19 , though , the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once , @entity0 enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team - mates unable to provide him with the service he requires			1
‘ it was difficult for him and difficult for his team - mates too , ’ @entity12 acknowledged			2
he also pointed to @entity144 ’s recent defeat here and complained that ‘ long balls into the box ’ made @entity51 ’s side hard to play against			2
but @entity10 played like a side that took one look at @entity152 ’s thumping defeat of @entity28 on saturday and concluded that a place in the @entity11 was already beyond their reach			1
they lacked urgency as well as energy , and while @entity12 could point to illness , injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display			2
‘ maybe we like playing on thursday nights ? ? ’ tweeted @entity162			0
captain @entity0 pictured in the tunnel beforehand with his @entity10 team as they prepared for the match with @entity7 it was the first time @entity0 has been captain this season for @entity10 as manager @entity12 put his faith in the young striker @entity53 receives treatment on the pitch before he was forced off through injury and replaced by @entity54 for @entity10 @entity53 was forced off through injury in the second half as @entity10 chased the win against @entity7 at @entity19 @entity10 had only two shots on target in this game — they have only managed fewer three times in @entity18 games this season			1
it remained more than a little perplexing that @entity12 waited until the 83rd minute to unleash @entity59 from the bench			2
the scorer of @entity127 ’s equaliser against @entity191 and probably full of confidence as a result , he might have injected some much - needed momentum into @entity10 ’s football			2
as it was he once again found himself the target of @entity199 ’s venom , the former @entity152 midfielder teasing him on @entity201 that he must have missed the bus			0
@entity51 focused more on the positives of his own team ’s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity , given how poor @entity10 were			2
a point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places , and on reflection his side had the best of the chances			2
@entity38 squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one - handed save from @entity52 shortly before the interval			0
the fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was			0
even after @entity51 had taken the fairly bold step of starting with @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity37			0
this game boasted the two hardest working players in the @entity18 this season , with @entity34 top of that list with 338.8km covered and @entity62 second , just 600m behind the @entity7 midfielder			1
@entity37 shoots under pressure from @entity10 's @entity55 during the match as @entity7 tried to steal three points @entity37 tumbles over as a chance goes begging for @entity7 against @entity10 in the @entity18 match @entity0 closes down @entity31 during the match as @entity10 and @entity7 played out a goalless draw on sunday @entity7 striker @entity38 stands with hands on hips as he failed to score during the @entity18 stalemate at @entity19 it was @entity34 ’s industry that created the first decent chance of the game , the pressure he applied on @entity58 forcing the newly capped @entity127 player into directing a back - pass into the path of @entity38			1
the @entity7 striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at @entity52			2
the second half was no better			0
@entity62 burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar , while @entity37 threatened too			0
@entity63 found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide			0
and the irrepressible @entity34 would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide			0
‘ i think we edged the game , ’ said @entity51 afterwards			0
‘ @entity38 ( @entity38 ) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he ’s probably just hit too cleanly			0
but i ’m pleased by the fact that we ’ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players			0
’ not that there was much evidence of that here			0
@entity62 runs with the ball and breaks clear of @entity34 and @entity31 as he tries to steal the win late on @entity10 manager @entity12 pictured on the touchline as he tried to get his team to take advantage of @entity7 away from home @entity7 manager @entity51 may well have taken a point before the match but may feel like his team could have stolen the victory			1

@entity0 became the youngest @entity18 player to be captain this season ( 21 years and 251 days )
@entity10 could not steal the win at @entity19 against relegation - threatened @entity7
@entity12 's side failed to take advantage of @entity28 's loss in the race for the top four
@entity10 are now seven points *adrift* of @entity144 in fourth but have played a game more
