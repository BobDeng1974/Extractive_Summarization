i remember sitting in our annual captains ’ conference at @entity4 ’s each year with the likes of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , and almost to a man we would say that the sport needed to be careful about the amount of cricket we were playing			2
the @entity13 would blame the national boards for scheduling too many matches , and then the boards would blame the @entity13 for setting up the @entity17			2
the diaries were brimming with games			2
and it ’s only got worse since i retired			2
it ’s no great surprise to me that @entity22 are playing 17 tests in nine months from april 2015 to january 2016			1
equally , we should n’t be surprised if the players themselves are too exhausted to complete the course			1
burn out ? @entity28 ( r ) is being forced to endure a test against @entity30 with a suspect knee barmy army ! @entity22 fans paying £ 85 a ticket will be disappointed if stars are rested physically , it ’s the fast bowlers who suffer			1
look at @entity28 right now , hobbling through a series against @entity30 with a dodgy knee			1
it ’s just not practical to ask these blokes to bowl consistently at 90mph — yet that ’s what crowds want to see			0
the sight of @entity47 steaming in over the winter was amazing , no matter which side you were supporting			0
i just worry we ’ll see it less and less			0
what we ’ll get is a watered - down version of the real thing			0
mentally , it ’s the batsmen who can get into difficulties			0
look at poor old @entity60			1
when you ’re on the road all the time and are struggling for scores , the loneliness of your hotel room can be a dangerous place to be			0
mind games : @entity60 struggled with a stress related illness while on the @entity73 tour of @entity74 do n’t get me wrong			1
we all make a good living out of the game			0
and while that happens no - one is going to stand up and say enough is enough			0
they ’ll just make their money more quickly and retire earlier , before riding off into the @entity84 sunset			0
but there ’s another factor we should consider : the fans			1
if i ’ve paid £ 85 months in advance for a day ’s test cricket , then find out in the week before the game that @entity22 are resting @entity92 , i would n’t be very amused			1
it ’s all to do with greed			0
it ’s punishing for those playing the game , and unfair on those paying to watch it .			1

@entity22 have been asked to play 17 tests in the next nine months
*congested* *fixtures* puts strain on players , especially fast bowlers like @entity28 and @entity92
there is also a mental strain as seen with @entity60 on @entity73 tour
@entity22 fans paying £ 85 a ticket will be disappointed if stars are rested
