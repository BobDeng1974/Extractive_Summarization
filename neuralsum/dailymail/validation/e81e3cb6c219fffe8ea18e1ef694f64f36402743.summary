@entity0 or @entity1 ? @entity2 knows who he 'd choose			1
the @entity5 boss made a brave decision when he shipped the former off to @entity8 , basing the spine of his team on £ 30million man @entity1			1
but could it have been the wrong choice ? this season , @entity0 has racked up more goals and more assists than @entity1 , while @entity2 's current midfield maestro searches desperately for his first goal since december			1
@entity0 has scored more goals and assisted more than @entity1 has this season @entity1 ( centre ) has not scored a goal for @entity5 since mid-december , while @entity0 is impressing @entity0 is in the process of establishing himself as one of the biggest talents in the @entity25 , helping @entity26 cement their place in the top echelons of @entity30 football			1
typically , the pair play in slightly different positions			0
@entity1 is more suited to a defensive midfield role , while @entity0 roams further forward			1
despite this , for £ 30m you would expect @entity1 to be firing on all cylinders , chipping in with more goals than he has been			2
@entity0 was signed for just shy of £ 7m in 2012 , but mostly consigned to a place on the @entity40 bench , starting just two @entity42 games in two years at the club			1
he was criminally underused in the league , especially if this season 's stats hint at his ability			2
19 assists to @entity1 ' 18 , 13 goals to @entity1 ' four			1
indeed , it is the goal count that is most worrying for @entity5			2
@entity0 was sold to @entity8 , and has scored 13 goals in the @entity25 this season for @entity5 , @entity0 was only given two starting places in the @entity42 in two years @entity1 was stifled against @entity53 in the @entity54 on wednesday was @entity2 right to sell @entity0 ? was @entity2 right to sell @entity0 ? now share your opinion they have not been desperate for scorers , admittedly - @entity59 and @entity60 have that covered - but their side could surely have been improved with the talents of the @entity64 midfielder			1
at the start of the 2013/14 season , @entity0 was given a fleeting chance to impress , before the door slammed shut on his @entity5 career			1
his final two starts in the @entity42			2
as assist for @entity72 , and an impressive performance that warranted praise from @entity75			0
' the surprise of the season , ' he was tipped as			0
following that , he was entrusted with a place in the starting xi against @entity82			0
60 minutes , zero goals , zero assists			0
and from there , zero starts			0
his only further @entity42 appearance came against @entity88 a month later			2
five minutes at the end , when the game was already won			0
he was shipped out on loan to @entity93 in january , where he impressed			0
perhaps it was the change of surroundings , perhaps slightly easier opposition , but @entity30 rivals @entity8 later decided that his performances were enough to be worthy of £ 18m			1
he scored 10 goals in 33 appearances on loan in @entity30 , and has continued where he left off this season			1
a brace against @entity105 on thursday is his latest story of success			0
@entity8 are now in a commanding position in their @entity109 last 16 tie , and that is mainly thanks to @entity0			1
when he was n't scoring , he was setting them up , and he earned deserved praise from all corners			0
@entity0 's @entity115 week was far more impressive , as he scored twice against @entity105 @entity2 has impressed in charge at @entity5 , but may be ruing his decision to let @entity0 go @entity1 , on the other hand , could not do the same against @entity53			1
another level of competition , yes , but it is worth considering whether @entity0 would have been able to make an impact			2
stifled by @entity123 and @entity124 , the @entity126 international was largely anonymous			0
there is no questioning @entity2 's eye for talent			0
he has produced them time and time again , but everyone makes mistakes			0
@entity0 may not have impressed week in , week out in a @entity5 shirt , but he was only 20 years old when he joined			1
three years later , he has matured into an impressive footballer			0
still baby - faced , but far from it with the ball at his feet			0
@entity1 ( right ) and his team - mates look dejected after conceding against @entity53 in the @entity54 a baby - faced @entity0 in action against @entity144 @entity143 all - star xi during a 2013 pre-season game			2

@entity0 started two league games for @entity5 in two years
he was given *minimal* chances to impress in the @entity42
this season for @entity8 , he has scored and assisted more goals than current @entity5 man @entity1
@entity154 has four goals , while @entity0 has *netted* 13 in @entity30
did @entity2 make a mistake letting the @entity64 midfielder leave ?
