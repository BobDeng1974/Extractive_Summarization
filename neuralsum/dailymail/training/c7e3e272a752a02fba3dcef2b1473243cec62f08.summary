' @entity30 is a situation where a large number of people simultaneously make requests of a website			2
@entity86 alleges @entity8 , of @entity87 , assisted in the web attacks on both the @entity3 website and the home secretary 's constituency website by posting a ' malicious ' weblink through his @entity22 account which , when clicked , allowed a web - user to add their connection to the cyber assault			1

@entity8 denies one charge of encouraging or assisting an offence under @entity66 ( 1 ) of the @entity67 ' these connections , the 8,347 , were made by a variety of originators of the same @entity30 message being circulated			1

' during the attack on the @entity3 website , @entity19 's constituency website was also attack from links posted on @entity22			2
the website ceased to function			0

' so what he was doing was saying if you want to help close down the @entity3 and @entity19 websites then here is the link and other people look at that and click that link			0
' mr @entity8 says no i did n't , it must have been somebody else using my @entity22 account			2
' if mr @entity8 is saying this was n't me that posted this on my @entity22 account then it must have been someone else and how did they do it because they do n't have his password			2
' you 're going to hear evidence that on the day he was arrested all his computers were taken and they 've all been examined by an expert and no malware , no @entity189 or no other performance email has gone in to that account which has enabled another person to steal his password			0
' so the only person who had that password was @entity8			0
