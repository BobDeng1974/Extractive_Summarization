@entity0 has been cleared of neglect after two patients died after being given kidneys from a rough sleeping alcoholic infected with a deadly parasite a doctor has been cleared of neglect after two patients died after being given kidneys from a rough sleeping alcoholic infected with a deadly parasite			1
father - of - six @entity10 , 42 , and new grandfather @entity11 , 67 , were given the kidneys at a hospital in @entity13			1
doctors had believed the alcoholic who donated them had died from meningitis			1
but an inquest heard it was later discovered the man - referred to as mr z - in fact died from the parasitic worm halicephalobus gingivalis			1
despite the organs being rejected by surgeons at six hospitals around the @entity26 , consultant surgeon @entity22 , 51 , decided on his own judgement to take a ' calculated risk ' and use them when they were accepted by @entity31 in @entity32			1
they were turned down elsewhere because of ' poor function ' and the unknown cause of death of the donor			0
an inquest heard the two men died within three weeks of being given the kidney transplants			1
a coroner yesterday cleared mr @entity22 of any neglect - and said no one could have predicted the kidneys were infected with a deadly parasitic worm			1
coroner @entity46 said : ' there was no gross neglect or failure in accepting the kidneys			2
' there is no test for this incredibly rare worm infection			1
these were the first deaths of this kind			0
' had it not been for the worm infection there is every indication the kidneys would have functioned and there is a likelihood both men would be alive now			1
' i find the medical professionals can not be criticised			0
' infections in humans are incredibly rare with only four cases previously discovered worldwide			2
both retired business developer mr @entity11 and father - of - six mr @entity10 died after contracting the nematode worm - in what was the first human to human transmission			1
acting @entity32 coroner @entity46 said there were things that could have been done better by doctors , such as finding out the results of a second lumber puncture on the donor			0
father - of - six @entity10 , 42 ( left ) , and new grandfather @entity11 , 67 ( right ) , were kept in the dark by doctors at a @entity82 hospital about the lifestyle of their donor , an inquest heard but he said that it ' remained unclear ' whether that would have changed the outcome given that @entity90 is virtually unheard of in the medical profession			1
the inquest also heard that there was nothing untoward in @entity31 transplant surgeon dr @entity22 accepting kidneys from someone suspected of dying from meningitis			1
@entity82 figures show that over the past 10 years there have been 52 patients with undiagnosed meningitis becoming organ donors			2
in recording a narrative verdict , mr @entity46 said : ' @entity104 ... ( and ) @entity10 died from the unintended consequences of necessary medical intervention			1
' mr @entity46 added that both mr @entity11 and mr @entity10 had given full consent for the transplants to go ahead and had been told about the donor dying from what was thought to be meningitis			1
he said both men faced a ' significant risk of dying ' on dialysis if they had not undergone the procedures			2
the transplant operations were carried out at the @entity31 in @entity32 however , relatives of the two dead men said their loved ones had not been in possession of the ' full facts ' before agreeing to go ahead with the operation			2
they were adamant they were not properly told about the meningitis link and the risks			2
speaking outside @entity32 @entity127 , solicitor @entity126 said patients must be more involved in decision - making , and they have to understand the risks and benefits			0
' the families are very keen to get across to the public that the underlying issue here is this was an incredibly rare experience			2
people should n't be put off transplantation , ' she added			0
ms @entity126 said she had taken instructions from the families to pursue their cases with the @entity142 as well investigate possible medical negligence claims			0
the inquest previously heard that donor mr @entity145 had a long history of alcoholism - and at one stage was drinking 240 units of alcohol per week			0
the 39 - year - old , who had cirrhosis of the liver , died in late november from a suspected viral infection			2
his next of kin then agreed for his organs to be donated			0
a string of hospitals declined the organs , before @entity32 's @entity31 took up the offer - with mr @entity10 and mr @entity11 getting one kidney each			1
family of @entity11 arriving at the inquest			0
the inquest also heard that there was nothing untoward in @entity31 transplant surgeon dr @entity22 accepting kidneys from someone suspected of dying from meningitis transplant surgeon dr @entity22 said it was commonplace in hospitals across the @entity26 to accept organs under the so - called ' fast track ' system			1
' if you are excluding high - risk donors then you are excluding 11 per cent of all donors in the country - that 's 1,500 transplants , ' he added			0
while the donor 's cause of death was only given as ' suspected ' meningitis or encephalitis , he was confident about taking the organ because mr @entity145 had undergone a five - day course of antibiotics			0
the inquest heard that a post-mortem examination had not been carried out on mr @entity145 - but even if it had , it would have been incredibly unlikely that a test for the rare parasite was carried out			0
tests before mr @entity145 died showed that the meningitis had not been caused by common bacteria or viruses			1
added to this , the deceased had not been abroad in the past six months - which reduced his chances of having an exotic virus			0
however , the inquest heard that dr @entity22 had not personally accessed the online database transplant surgeons sometimes use - the @entity207 ( @entity207 )			1
pictured is the family of @entity10			2
both retired business developer mr @entity11 and father - of - six mr @entity10 died after contracting the nematode worm - in what was the first human to human transmission but he said he had been told all the information on the @entity207 via a telephone conversation with a specialist transplant nurse			1
it also transpired that the results of a second lumber puncture on the donor had not been placed on the system - although coroner mr @entity46 reiterated that this would not have shed any light on the cause of his brain infection			0
both men died - two days apart - in mid-december 2013			1
for father - of - three mr @entity10 , it was his third transplant , while it was mr @entity11 's first			2
mr @entity11 's widow , @entity230 , believed her husband was coping very well on dialysis and would have been happy to stay on it for the rest of his life			0
however , in his conclusion , mr @entity46 said both men 's chances of surviving long term on dialysis given their circumstances would not have been high			0
a @entity243 professor , who was part of a three - person panel asked to review the case , said that , while he would not have used the organs himself , no - one could have predicted the tragedy			0
' i doubt we 'll ever see ( a case like this ) again			0
no - one could have foreseen it			0

@entity10 and @entity255 were given kidneys at hospital in @entity13
it was thought the alcoholic who donated them had died from meningitis
he in fact died from the rare parasitic worm @entity90
the men both died within three weeks of being given the transplants
consultant surgeon @entity22 was today cleared of any blame
