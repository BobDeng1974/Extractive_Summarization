an @entity1 arms company has revealed details of a laser defense system with ' @entity5 ' style technology which can shoot missiles from the sky with a pulse of energy			1
state - owned @entity10 said the futuristic military hardware called @entity12 was almost ready for deployment			1
it works by firing a focused laser at targets which are heated so rapidly they disintegrate in an instant			1
cutting edge : @entity10 , which currently makes surface - to - air missile systems , pictured , unveiled details of its @entity23 missile shield the arms maker publicised specifications of its @entity23 ( @entity23 ) at this week 's @entity26 , which is @entity29 's largest aerospace and defense exhibition			1
' it 's exactly like what you see in @entity5 , ' said company spokesman @entity33			0
' you see the lasers go up so quickly like a flash and the target is finished			2
' the radical system is the culmination of five years to work involving solid - state lasers by 15 engineers , the company said			1
@entity12 is designed to intercept close - range drones , rockets and mortars which might not remain in the air long enough for @entity1 's current @entity49 missile defense system to intercept			1
protection : @entity1 launches an @entity49 defence missile in the southern @entity1 city of @entity53 in response to a rocket launched from the nearby @entity57 @entity56 @entity49 batteries have shot down hundreds of rockets launched by @entity61 militants from the @entity56 at @entity1 cities			1
countries are vying to weaponise laser technology			2
the @entity65 announced last year that it will attach a prototype of its @entity67 ( @entity68 ) to @entity69 and send the amphibious transport docking ship to the @entity71 in 2014			0
this will be the first time a laser weapon is used in active service			2
the blast of infrared energy it delivers can disable a small boat or even take down a drone from above as an impressive @entity65 video shows			0
@entity65 researchers told reporters that the laser gun , or a ' directed energy pulse weapon ' as the military call it , destroyed its targets 100 percent of the time in testing			1
' it operates much like a blowtorch ... with an unlimited magazine , ' a @entity65 official said			0
the solid - state laser prototype does n't use up expensive ammunition so is cheap to operate			2
' its weapon round costs about $ 1 to shoot , ' said rear admiral @entity95 , a @entity65 researcher			0
however , @entity68 costs more to build in the first place - at around $ 32 million per unit			0
with no peace deal in sight and also threatened by @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity1 wants to beef up that system and develop further protection			2
@entity104 , an expert in military sciences at the @entity106 , said @entity12 is potentially an effective addition to @entity1 's defenses rather than a drastic change			0
' essentially , its military and tactical utility will be particularly useful in complementing the already proven @entity49 in tackling very short range threats such as rockets and mortar fire and in close quarter engagements , ' he said			1
@entity10 said test data show @entity12 lasers are blasting away more than 90 percent of their targets			1
the new system can also be modified so that multiple lasers can be used to hit a target , according to the company			1
but officials remain tight lipped as to when and how the @entity12 will be deployed			0
@entity124 , the company spokesman , said : ' it 's very accurate and will help avoid collateral damage			0
' he added : ' when you use lasers , you have an unlimited magazine			2
' besides @entity12 and @entity49 , @entity1 is also developing the next phase of its @entity133 which can intercept missiles in space and the upcoming @entity136 , which shoots down short and mid-range ballistic missiles			1
but some feel @entity1 , which gets significant funding from key ally the @entity141 for missile defense capabilities , is going overboard			2
@entity143 , a research fellow from the @entity144 in @entity145 , said @entity1 military superiority in the region was so firmly established that @entity12 was unlikely to change anything in the short or medium term			0
shield : the solid - state laser technology is designed to hit targets the current @entity49 , pictured , is unable to reach in time interception : an @entity1 @entity49 missile is launched near the city of @entity157 , southern @entity1 , to intercept a rocket fired from @entity56 reinforced : the @entity12 system is designed to protect against objects which might not be picked up by the current @entity49 defenses , pictured in this graphic ' the development of another layer says more about @entity1 paranoia , ' he said			1
' the possibility of a conventional attack against @entity1 is next to nil and there is hardly a need for five layers of missile defense systems			2
' @entity10 would not comment on how much @entity12 would cost or how much has been invested in it so far			1
' it 's very hard to say			0
we 're still testing and it can be modified in many different ways , ' @entity124 said			0
other nations and private companies may be keen on using the laser based technology to protect against attacks			0
@entity1 has become one of the world 's leading weapons exporters			0
@entity1 arms companies often point out that they bring with them years of firsthand experience from conflicts with @entity57 militants in the @entity56 and the @entity190 , jihadi militants in @entity193 's @entity192 desert and @entity100 guerrillas .			0

laser shield can intercept drones , rockets , missiles and mortars
@entity23 rapidly heats an object until it *explodes* , makers claim
@entity10 said its lasers destroyed 90 *%* of targets
system is designed to intercept objects current @entity49 can not
current defense system has destroyed hundreds of @entity61 rockets
