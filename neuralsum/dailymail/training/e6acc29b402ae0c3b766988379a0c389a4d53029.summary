an @entity1 man shattered the record for fastest drive from @entity4 to @entity5 last saturday by making the transcontinental trip in 28 hours 50 minutes			1
@entity7 spent years outfitting a 2004 @entity8 with expensive gadgetry , spare gas tanks , and , of course , bedpans and finally realized his dream october 20			1
that smashes the record set in 2006 by an unbelievable two hours			1
but his attempt is sure to gather controversy as it involved traveling at an average of 98mph , well in excess of many speed limits			2
he also used a series of gadgets to avoid getting caught for speeding			0
he did it in 28 hours 50 minutes the @entity39 dealership sales director is hesitant to show off the proof , but according to @entity47 , the 27 - year - old has gps data tracking every inch of the journey he took with a co-pilot and passenger starting october 19			1
‘ i 've wanted to break the record since i was 18 years old , ’ @entity7 said , explaining away the trip ’s huge costs and many risks			1
he began putting all the pieces together years ago , first by buying a used @entity59 blue mercedes from a man in @entity61 , @entity62			0
‘ i thought about a @entity63 612 , ’ said @entity70 ‘ but gas mileage would 've been bad			0
a @entity65 would 've been perfect , but you 'd want the @entity67 for gas mileage , and those are still way too expensive			0
’ souped up : @entity7 planned the trip for years and pumped untold sums into the car for gps , laser jammers , cb radio , and other gizmos that helped ferry him safely and very quickly through a dozen states large tanks : in order to cut down on fuel stops , @entity80 installed two 22 - gallon addition gas tanks that let him drive 800 miles straight -- with the help of bedpans previous record holder : @entity87 's october 19 to 20 drive blows @entity90 's 2006 record of 31 hours 4 minutes out of the water famous race : a zany 1981 comedy starring @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96 immortalized the @entity97 , which took place in real life for much of the 1970s the origins of the @entity97 are n't entirely clear , but the death defying and hugely illegal race from @entity4 to @entity5 is named after @entity103			1
@entity103 made history in 1933 when , apparently just to say he did it , he raced from coast to coast in 53 hours 30 minutes in a car called the @entity108			2
fast forward to the 1970s , when cars could go far faster than @entity103 's @entity110 , and @entity112 editor @entity111 created the @entity114 - to - @entity113			2
for years , daring drivers vied for the title of what became known as the @entity97			2
a 1981 comedy starring @entity94 and @entity95 immortalized the name			0
the run was last completed by @entity121 and @entity122 in 32 hours 51 minutes behind the wheel of a @entity124			2
their record was next bested in the @entity128 race , which replaced the illicit @entity97 , by @entity129 and @entity130			2
their time of 32 hours and 7 minutes was n't beaten until @entity90 did it in 31 hours 4 minutes in a @entity133 in 2006			1
now , they 're all @entity135 also - rans and @entity87 's feat wo n't be easily topped			1
he chose the @entity8 for its fuel economizing v8 engine and active suspension he needed in order to pack in as much fuel as possible			0
@entity7 ’s whip boasts two additional 22 - gallon gas tanks , which add hundreds of pounds of fuel but allow the car to travel 800 miles between stops			1
but breaking the record was going to take more than just a souped up @entity8			1
to ensure a clear run , free from traffic jams and , perhaps more importantly , traffic cops @entity87 , also invested in a police scanner , two gps units that relay traffic information and @entity151 apps such as @entity152			0
the car was also fitted with two laser jammers and had a truck mounted antenna			0
friends were enlisted to travel along the route , about 150 miles ahead of the @entity8 , and check for any potential obstacles			1
@entity7 decided to take the classic route pioneered by the illegal street racers of the @entity167 of the 1970s aka cannonball run : @entity169 in @entity170 to the @entity171 in @entity172 , @entity173			1
' i 've wanted to break the record since i was 18 years old ' : @entity7 has now lived his dream and did n't get a single ticket on the way ' i do n't even remember @entity179 ' : @entity7 says it was tough getting out of @entity170 , but once they did it was smooth sailing all the way to @entity5 almost here : they got to @entity173 as the sun rose on october 20			1
they could have played it safe and gone the speed limit as the rising western sun blinded them instead , they pushed it in order to make their feat all the more impressive and they 're off : the classic starting line and the place where @entity80 's historic run began , the @entity169 , sits between @entity200 and @entity201 in @entity170 cool finish : the @entity97 ends here , at @entity172 , @entity173 's @entity171 , 2,813.7 from where it begins in @entity4 ‘ every year , @entity90 hears about five to seven attempts to break the record , ’ said @entity209 ‘ none of the challengers come close			1
’ but by far the most difficult part of @entity87 ’s endeavor , he said , was finding people to make the trip with him			2
with only two weeks until he was scheduled to go , nobody had agreed to take on the challenge with him			0
then , after trawling deep within his @entity217 friends , he found @entity31			0
‘ i got a @entity217 message from @entity7 , ’ @entity31 told @entity47 , ‘ he did n't even have my cell phone number			0
’ along with a friend of @entity87 ’s , @entity224 , as co-pilot , the three of them piled into the @entity8 on october 19			1
proof : @entity7 used technology to track and eventually prove his feat , hiring a @entity230 company to follow him every inch of the way and even gauge his speed things did not go well initially			2
‘ it took us 15 minutes to get out of @entity170 , ’ @entity7 said			1
but then things quickly picked up			0
they had friends drive ahead and check for cops and obstacles			0
@entity242 passed , then @entity243 , then @entity244			0
they kept a breakneck pace			0
‘ i do n't even remember @entity179 , ’ @entity7 said			0
by the time they got to @entity250 , they were making such good time that they could have gone the speed limit the rest of the way and still tied @entity90 ’s time			2
instead , they pushed it			0
and on october 20 , they reached @entity172 , @entity173 ’s @entity171			1
they ’d beat the record by an astonishing two hours and gone down in history with the fastest cannonball run drive in history			0
astonishing : with @entity80 at the wheel , @entity30 as co-pilot , and @entity31 on a spare tire in back , the trio drove 2,813.7 in 28 hours 50 minutes			1

@entity39 dealer @entity7 used a souped up a 2004 @entity8 to speed into the record books october 20
@entity170 to @entity172 : @entity7 and two friends took the classic route first taken in the @entity97 of the 1970s
@entity7 's time of 28 hours 50 minutes beats the previous record set by @entity90 in 2006 when he made the trip in 31 hours 4 minutes by over two hours
with a *distance* of 2,813.7 miles , @entity87 and his two - man team did the @entity97 at an average of 98 miles per hour
