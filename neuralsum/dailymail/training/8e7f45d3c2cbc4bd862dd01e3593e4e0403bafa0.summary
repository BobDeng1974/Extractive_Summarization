by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:32 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 18:28 est , 24 july 2013 @entity3 's most powerful union baron last night threatened to slash funding to the party unless he is given even greater powers to dictate policy and impose candidates			1
unite boss @entity9 , who has funded @entity10 to the tune of £ 8million , said he was sick of being ‘ taken for granted by people who welcome our money , but not our policy input ’			1
in a speech to union activists , he demanded that @entity3 shift further to the @entity18 , saying he would not bankroll a party that was ‘ a pinkish shadow of the present coalition ’			1
demands : unite leader @entity9 warned the union would not longer hand over money to the @entity19 without getting anything in return mr @entity9 , known as ‘ @entity27 ’ for his hard - left views , attacked mr @entity10 ’s handling of a vote - rigging row in @entity31 , branding it an ‘ utter , utter disgrace ’			1
he said the row had brought relations with the party to ‘ breaking point ’ and made it clear that funding is likely to be cut as a result			1
mr @entity9 warned that @entity3 ’s income , 85 per cent of which is provided by the unions , could shrink , ‘ possibly quite dramatically ’			1
he would be demanding ‘ enhanced policy input ’ and ‘ more of an impact on parliamentary selections ’ if @entity42 was to continue bankrolling the party			1
it marks an escalation in the stand - off between the unions and @entity3 leader @entity10 who has moved to shift the party ’s relationship with its big money backer backers			1
since mr @entity10 became leader in 2010 @entity42 has given £ 8.4million to the @entity19			2
but in the wake of the row over @entity42 allegedly trying to fix @entity3 ’s candidate selection in @entity31 , he moved to overhaul the rules which would stop union members automatically becoming @entity19 members			1
mr @entity10 faced warnings that only around one in 10 union members would opt - in to the party , costing it millions of pounds in funding which it used to receive automatically			2
in a wide - ranging speech yesterday mr @entity9 claimed @entity42 is at a ‘ turning point ’ in its historic relationship with the @entity19			1
speaking to a meeting of @entity42 activists , he said strains in the link between @entity3 and the unions have been building up for years , at least since the advent of @entity3 in the 1990s			1
row : labour leader @entity10 has sought to overhaul the party 's links to the unions ‘ those strains have been fuelled by the failures and disappointments of @entity3 in office , not least its refusal to seriously address the unique legal impediments trade unions have to work under in @entity86			1
‘ they have been worsened by the feeling that for a long time we have been taken for granted by people who welcome our money , but not our policy input , who want to use our resources at election time but do not want our members as candidates			1
‘ and all this in an environment when ordinary people in all walks of life have become increasingly disengaged from and disenchanted with politics and politicians			0
’ mr @entity9 welcomed changes to the historic arrangements for affiliating union members to @entity3 which have been put forward by party leader @entity10			1
a special conference will be held next @entity108 to agree details of the changes , under which union members would have to agree to opt - in to @entity3 membership			2
but he warned the union would stop handing over money without strings attached			0
he said : ‘ certainly @entity42 will be using its political fund for a variety of initiatives and not just handing it over to the @entity19 as has generally happened up until now			2
’ @entity120 chairman @entity119 said : ' this is proof that @entity10 ’s proposed changes to @entity3 ’s link with the unions would actually increase @entity9 ’s control over @entity3 ’s coffers			2
' @entity9 has said he will use his increased bargaining power to demand @entity3 adopt the policies he wants			2
and he will still be able to fix @entity3 ’s candidate selections and pick @entity3 ’s leader			2
' so nothing has changed			0
@entity10 would still be too weak to take the difficult decisions needed to cut the deficit or fix welfare			0
it would be the same old labour with hardworking people paying the price			0
' unite leader mr @entity9 said many people were saying that the relationship with @entity3 had to change even before a row flared over union members being signed up for party membership in @entity31 ahead of a selection meeting			1
however education secretary @entity146 said the proposed opt - in changes could strengthen union influence over the @entity19 ‘ @entity10 has made some bold and far - reaching proposals for recasting the trade union relationship with the @entity19			2
i know that some pundits were expecting me to reject them outright , ’ mr @entity9 added			0
‘ to re-run the experience of the last generation on this issue - the party leader says something , the unions reject it and have no positive proposals of their own , the first plan goes through anyway and we look like not just losers , but conservative losers			0
‘ well , we all honour our movement 's traditions , but this is one tradition overdue for a change			0
@entity42 is doing things differently in one area of our work after another , including politics			0
‘ we need to do things differently here too			0
we need to engage , rethink and see if we can find better ways to advance our ends			0
’ however education secretary @entity146 said the proposed opt - in changes could strengthen union influence over the @entity19			0
at an event hosted by @entity180 in central @entity181 , he said : ‘ it will be the case that fewer are automatically affiliated to the @entity19 as trade union members and that appears to be a diminution in trade union influence			0
‘ actually , what it could lead to is the union 's exercising more influence because , rather than money flowing automatically , money will go to the @entity19 depending on whether or not the trade union general secretaries , who retain control of their union 's political funds , decide that the policies and the candidate selection of the @entity19 are in accordance with their wishes			0
‘ so , @entity9 does n't lose anything , who does n't lose any money			0
what he does gain is control over whether or not that money goes to @entity3			0

@entity208 boss warns he will no longer ' hand over ' millions to @entity3
he says @entity42 is at a ‘ turning point ’ in its historic relationship
@entity208 has been ' taken for granted ' by party which ignores ' policy input '
