by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 12:37 est , 2 march 2013 bosses at @entity2 are threatening to scrap posh ' @entity4 ' dinners ' after light - fingered students have been helping themselves to cutlery from the high - brow events			1
students at @entity9 have pinched a catalogue of items , including decanters , crystal punch bowls , side plates and expensive silverware			1
now the deans of the college , whose former students include chancellor @entity19 , are threatening to stop future events unless the property is returned			1
helping themselves : students stole items including decanters , crystal punch bowls , side plates and expensive silverware from the @entity29 event at @entity9 ( pictured ) , in @entity30 university chiefs admit to ' turning a blind eye ' to the petty thefts in the past but they have now lost patience , @entity2 's independent student newspaper , @entity32 , reports			1
a letter sent out to the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) after the @entity40 last week , stated : ' this evening saw the last @entity4 ' dinner of the year			1
' over the past few months we have invited all first - year undergraduates to dine in the @entity44 as our guests			0
' at each dinner several decanters , stoppers , and other items of college property have been removed without permission			0
' we would be grateful if these items could now be returned			2
the same applies to any items removed in previous years			0
' often , as tonight , it has been obvious what has been happening , but we have turned a blind eye to those involved on the assumption that these items would be returned quickly and safely			2
' lost patience : deans are threatening to stop future events unless the property is returned			1
file picture shows graduates walking towards the @entity66 under the @entity67 , in @entity30 the letter added that stolen items could be left anonymously outside the door of the @entity71			1
it concluded : ' if we do not receive the removed items we will have to consider whether we should continue to hold these dinners next year			2
' @entity39 president @entity76 said culprits could be punished			0
writing on the @entity79 group she said : ' the staff often note who they spot with what ( you 're less subtle than you think ! ) so i would n't take the risk if i were you			0
' it 's fine as a harmless prank of course , and it is a bit of a tradition now , but if the stuff is n't returned they wo n't be able to host them next year and that would be such a shame for the next cohort			1
' they are even still missing big items like fruit bowls and decanters			0
' the row comes three months after @entity104 students boycotted the dining hall in a ' strike ' against plans to force undergraduates to pay Â£ 150 a year extra for meals			2
first year @entity111 student @entity110 told @entity2 's independent student newspaper , @entity32 : ' other than the small matter of it technically being theft it seems to be to be a great and noble tradition			1
' after all , i feel like i 've been robbed every time i open my battels sheets , it 's only fair that we even up the score now and then			0
' furthermore , i thought university encouraged education and equipping us with the skills we 'll need for our careers ? ' personally i would like to be a bank robber or a high profile art thief			0
' ' it 's fine as a harmless prank of course , and it is a bit of a tradition now , but if the stuff is n't returned they wo n't be able to host them next year and that would be such a shame for the next cohort ' - @entity39 president @entity76 a first year historian said : ' i think traditions like this are great as long as they 're just a bit of fun and do n't end up costing the college or depriving others in the future			1
' i myself , along with many others , removed a rather large number of items on friday night , which i returned to the @entity4 over the weekend			2
' i was impressed when returning my decanters to find an antique table and a silver tray had also been left there			0
' ' i can understand why it was necessary to request that the items be returned but i very much enjoyed the dinner and hope they will be held in the future ; and they would n't be anywhere near as fun without the added thrill of everyone trying to subtly cram cutlery and tableware into their pockets			0
