there was a moment in the first half when @entity4 ’s supporters rose to their feet to sing for the champions of @entity8 football			0
@entity9 turned to his assistants and asked in a dismissive tone whether they could hear them			2
yes they could , @entity9 , loud and clear			2
@entity15 ’s increasingly irritable manager makes no bones about the fact he wants to get his hands on the @entity19 again after @entity4 powered on to win it last season			1
@entity15 boss @entity9 was a real nuisance on the touchline on saturday night these are troubled times for @entity9 and he is fighting wars again after @entity25 was banned by the @entity26 for three games following that stamp on @entity29 last week			1
before kick - off there was a cursory handshake with @entity33 , a substitute for @entity4 here and a player @entity9 once described as the world ’s best midfielder in a previous era			1
to think there were times when @entity9 tried to take him to @entity41 and even @entity42 and their relationship has come to this			0
perhaps there are no friendships in football any more			0
@entity9 gestures to referee @entity48 during the crunch @entity19 encounter he has fallen out with the broadcasters too , refusing to grant the 19 overseas tv channels who had made their way to @entity55 an interview before the game			1
come on @entity9 , you 're way better than that			0
the self - imposed gagging order did not last long , particularly when @entity4 ’s supporters repeatedly told @entity15 ’s manager to sit in the technical area			2
each time he acknowledged them , turning to them in the @entity67 and giving then a little wave with his left hand			0
@entity9 offered just a cursory handshake to @entity33 on his return to @entity15 @entity9 could not disguise his feelings towards his former player during the 1 - 1 draw they baited @entity15 ’s manager throughout , antagonising him with a series of put - downs and songs that are guaranteed to wind him up at the best of times			1
he asks for it out there , jabbing a finger in the face of fourth official @entity84 when he demanded more protection for @entity86			2
on this occasion he had a point			0
@entity9 is becoming a nuisance down there , behaving erratically as his team chase down honours in the @entity19 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
@entity9 makes his point to fourth official @entity84 at @entity55 you would think that @entity9 , of all people , would be able to handle the unexpected events , such as @entity25 ’s retrospective punishment , better than any other coach on earth			1
he has , as @entity15 supporters sang , ‘ won more than you ’ after @entity103 diverted @entity105 's strike beyond @entity106 for @entity4 ’s equaliser			0
there is also the history with @entity110 , with the pair sharing a mutual loathing for each other after they clashed during @entity9 ’s spell as @entity42 coach			2
@entity9 also exchanged words with @entity4 manager @entity110 last season , when @entity118 scored @entity15 ’s last minute winner beyond @entity120 , the coach jumped over bodies to find his son @entity123 in the crowd to celebrate with him			1
this time round he was bristling again , calling it on with the opposition , the referee @entity48 and occasionally @entity4 ’s bench during this hard - fought game			0
after this he will have to wait a little longer before he is champion again .			0

@entity9 *desperate* to get his hands on the @entity19 again
the @entity15 boss behaved erratically on the touchline during 1 - 1 draw
@entity9 exchanged cursory handshake with @entity33
he had words with rival boss @entity110 and the fourth official
