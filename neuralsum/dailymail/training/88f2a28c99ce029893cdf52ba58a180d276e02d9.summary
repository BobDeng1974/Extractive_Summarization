@entity1 caused anger when she walked away with the massive pay - off after just 20 months as head of @entity5			1
@entity16 chairman @entity15 condemned the pay - off as ‘ deeply concerning ’ when details finally emerged in june			1
mr @entity15 , who was a local government minister at the time , said : ‘ i find dipping into the public purse to make such an eye - watering pay - off unacceptable ’			1
but last night it was announced that mrs @entity1 , 49 , has been made the @entity24 ’s director - general for civil service reform on a salary of £ 142,000 a year – just £ 500 less than the prime minister			2
cabinet office minister @entity28 defended the appointment , saying mrs @entity1 ‘ brings experience and expertise to this crucial role ’			0
sir @entity33 , head of the civil service , said he was ‘ delighted ’ with the appointment , describing mrs @entity1 as ‘ an accomplished leader with a track record of successful change management in the wider public sector ’			1
but critics said the appointment raised questions about the government ’s commitment to tackle the scandal of council bosses and quangocrats who get huge pay - offs only to walk into lucrative new jobs in the public sector months later			1
cabinet office minister @entity28 ( left ) and sir @entity33 , head of the civil service , have both welcomed @entity1 's appointment overseeing reform of @entity56 @entity57 , chief executive of the @entity58 ’ @entity59 , said members of the public were likely to view the appointment with deep suspicion			1
he said : ‘ @entity1 is the poster girl for senior public sector staff riding the job @entity64			1
' despite pocketing vast sums of taxpayers ’ money simply for leaving her role at @entity5 , she has landed yet another role at our expense			0
‘ given that @entity1 is in charge of civil service reform , her first task should be to end the culture of excessive golden goodbyes with which she is all too familiar			0
’ ' riding the job @entity64 ' @entity57 , chief executive of the @entity59 mrs @entity1 , who said she was ‘ thrilled ’ with her new job , has held a string of top council posts , most recently as the £ 197,000 - a - year ‘ managing director ’ of @entity5			2
she left in december after axing 1,000 jobs at a cost of almost £ 11million			0
the council ’s accounts revealed she had received a final year package of £ 589,165 , including a £ 420,000 pay - off , £ 139,806 in salary and a £ 29,359 pension contribution			2
she sparked fury in her previous job as chief executive of @entity93 by arguing that her £ 197,136 salary was good value as it represented only 29p for each person in the county			0
she also faced mockery at the time for her love of management speak , which included a ‘ @entity107 ’ campaign that encouraged staff to focus on the overall ‘ flavour ’ of council services			0
former employer : @entity5 in @entity109 in opposition , the @entity110 pledged to clamp down on huge public sector payouts			2
but despite modest reforms , the pattern has continued			0
earlier this month it emerged that 450 council chiefs were handed six - figure pay - offs in the last year , with mrs @entity1 receiving the biggest package of all			1
an investigation by the @entity121 revealed that dozens of bosses at regional development agencies also received six - figure pay - offs when the quangos were wound up this year			2
in many cases those involved landed lucrative jobs in the state sector just days later			0
mrs @entity1 will now lead a project designed to ‘ reform ’ the civil service			0
mr @entity28 said he wanted a civil service that was ‘ flatter , faster , more digital , more unified , with better capabilities and performance management , focused on outcomes not process , with modern terms and conditions ’ .			0

ministers condemned @entity1 's pay - off as ' *disturbing* and unacceptable '
now she is working for the government *overhauling* @entity56
