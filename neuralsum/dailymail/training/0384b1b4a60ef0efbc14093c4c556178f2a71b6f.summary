it could have resulted in the death not only of your daughter , but you and other people along that terrace ' but passing sentence the judge mr recorder @entity246 said : ' this was a deliberate ignition with a naked @entity251 offence is a serious offence , it 's a terrace set of houses , it 's 11 o'clock at night			0
' you set fire to your house			0
you had your child with you at the time			0
it could have resulted in the death not only of your daughter , but you and other people along that terrace			0
' ' i accept this was a spur of the moment thing , something to do , perhaps , with the fact you had had a fight with your boyfriend and you went back in a temper and did what you did			0
