by @entity0 for the @entity1 and @entity2 , in @entity3 support : @entity5 , pictured with her husband dr @entity6 , has taken to @entity7 to vent her frustrations at the @entity10 leader @entity5 has accused @entity11 of ‘ scaremongering ’ over the threat to the @entity14 in @entity15 if it stays in the @entity17			1
the @entity19 - born writer , who has lived in @entity3 for many years , took to @entity7 to vent her frustration at a series of claims from the @entity10 ahead of this month ’s independence referendum			1
mr @entity11 has claimed the health service can only be protected from ‘ privatisation ’ in an independent @entity15 , even though policy is already fully devolved to @entity3			1
miss @entity5 is married to dr @entity6 , a former hospital doctor in @entity3 who is now a gp , and has donated millions of pounds to tackling multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases			2
in june she was subjected to a torrent of online abuse by @entity15 nationalists after giving £ 1million to the no campaign			1
yesterday , the @entity35 author directed her 3.6million @entity7 followers to a ‘ fact check ’ by @entity38 , which concludes : ‘ @entity39 can use more private providers , introduce more charges or stand on its head , but there is no pressure on @entity15 to follow suit and no reason why health funding to @entity15 will be affected			1
’ challenged by photographer @entity48 on @entity7 , the author later replied : ‘ i fund medical research in @entity15 ( @entity50 )			1
i ’m also married to a @entity15 gp who deplores scaremongering on the @entity14			2
’ @entity54 msp @entity52 said : ‘ @entity5 is absolutely right			2
the nationalists are trying to scare people on the @entity14			2
they should stop it now			0
’ but deputy first minister @entity58 denied scaremongering , saying an independent @entity15 would help to ‘ protect our public services like the @entity14 ’			0
meanwhile , @entity61 yesterday pledged to lead the negotiations to win new powers for @entity15 following a no vote in the referendum			0
the former prime minister insisted a vote to keep the @entity68 ‘ does not mean no change ’			0
at a @entity54 event in @entity71 , mr @entity61 revealed he has written to commons speaker @entity72 demanding a full debate when parliament returns in october to thrash out the extra powers that will be handed to @entity76 if full independence is rejected			0
@entity54 , the @entity78 and the @entity79 are agreed further devolution should follow a no vote , but have set out different visions of what should be included			0
mr @entity61 , who is believed to have agreed his plan with @entity85 , said the other two parties would have to ‘ accept our proposals ’ , as the @entity78 have almost no representation north of the border and the @entity79 are languishing in sixth place in the polls			0
he said this would involve @entity15 being given new tax - raising powers and control over some benefits , including housing benefit			1
but he said there would be no change in the funding formula , which @entity19 @entity99 complain leads to @entity15 being subsidised by @entity19 taxpayers			1
he also launched an assault on mr @entity11 , particularly over his suggestion that an independent @entity15 could continue to use the pound even if @entity71 rejects a full currency union			0
he said this would leave @entity15 in a ‘ colonial relationship ’ with the rest of the @entity17 , as interest rates would be set in @entity119 without any regard for the needs of the @entity15 economy .			0
