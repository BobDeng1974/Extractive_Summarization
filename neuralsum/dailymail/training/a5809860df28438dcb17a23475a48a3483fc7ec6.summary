but they do have a serious purpose			0
the mini corgis , along with a cute pair of tiny black cavapoos , are the stars of @entity11 's new breast cancer awareness campaign , launched in association with charity @entity13 ! ' the idea is these guys are puppies and you guys have puppies , ' explains @entity13 ! founder and breast cancer survivor , @entity21			1
' a different kind of puppies - boobies - so what better way to be reminded to check your boobs than with these cute guys ? ' adorable : these two tiny dark corgis are helping to raise awareness of breast cancer although breast cancer is more common in older women , the campaign is targeting those between 18 and 35 , who are less likely to check their breasts regularly			1
last year there were 541 cases in this age group but despite this many are still more likely to get their eyes tested than check their breasts for lumps			1
@entity21 , who was diagnosed with breast cancer at 23 says : ' women stand a one in eight chance of getting breast cancer at some point in their lives			1
' getting women to regularly check their breasts therefore has to become a ritual and needs to be on people ’s minds all year round			1
' the more we remind people , the more we hope it ’ll become a habit			0
hence # @entity59 was born			1
' at the beginning of every month , a new puppy picture will appear on @entity13 ! 's free app to remind users to check their @entity65 image will also appear on @entity11 's website and social media channels			1
cute ! the images are part of the # @entity71 campaign launched by @entity11 and @entity13 ! ' it ’s almost six months since @entity73 month , ' said @entity74 , editor of @entity11			1
' with over a third of women admitting they never check their breasts , it ’s essential that boob checking remains at the top of women ’s agendas			1
' early detection saves lives , so we ’re urging women to help us spread the " @entity90 " message by sharing our pictures as widely as they can			1
' @entity13 ! has also launched a campaign video starring @entity92 , who urges viewers to get their breasts checked			2
other celebrity supporters include @entity95 and singer , @entity97			0
