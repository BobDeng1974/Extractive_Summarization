excess : @entity1 's first lady @entity0 has carried on shopping as the killing in @entity1 spreads			1
she orders @entity5 food for her three children because she does n't want them to have a @entity1 diet she was once described as ‘ a rose in the desert ’ , a long - limbed , @entity11 beauty who used her elegance and @entity5 style to mask the increasing brutality of her husband ’s murderous regime			1
but as @entity0 shelters in a bomb - proof bunker to avoid the horrors erupting within @entity1 – and to escape the @entity22 missiles expected soon to rain down on the country – she has become more of a @entity25 figure , shopping for extravagant designer goods , food and health products online as the country collapses around her			1
while more than 100,000 men , women and children have been killed and nearly two million @entity1 have fled the country since march 2011 , @entity0 , 38 , recently splashed out on some bohemian crystal chandeliers from @entity35			1
she also regularly orders @entity5 food in bulk for her three children as she does n’t want them to eat only @entity1 food , according to an insider			1
and in photographs posted on her @entity42 account only last week , she is shown wearing a new blue £ 80 @entity43 on her right wrist – a device designed to help wearers keep track of how many steps they take and calories they burn			0
the spending seems to have accelerated along with the killing in @entity1			1
last year , leaked emails showed she had ordered furniture – including five chandeliers – worth £ 270,000 from a shop on @entity11 ’s @entity56 as her husband ’s brutal quelling of the @entity1 rebellion intensified			1
because of sanctions , the goods are imported to @entity1 through @entity62			2
but until very recently , @entity0 travelled to @entity62 herself to meet up with her @entity11 - based parents @entity64 , a consultant cardiologist , and mother @entity66 , a retired @entity1 diplomat			1
they still spend part of the year living in the pebble - dashed @entity11 semi-detached house where their only daughter and her two brothers grew up			0
mrs @entity0 studied at @entity74 , then worked as a banker at @entity76 when she met her future husband who was training in @entity11 to become an eye surgeon			1
mrs @entity0 ’s parents are now spending more time in @entity62			1
‘ it ’s a short drive from @entity84 and the parents are spending most of their time there so they can stay in touch with their daughter , ’ said @entity81 , a former adviser to @entity0 ’s husband			1
mr @entity81 told @entity89 that @entity0 had lived a remarkably sheltered life in @entity84 since she married @entity91 in a secret ceremony on @entity93 2001			2
‘ she is at the centre of a fool ’s court , ’ he said			0
@entity97 has been branded ‘ a thug and a murderer ’ by @entity22 secretary of state @entity98 , but @entity0 ‘ continues to view herself as the respectable wife of a president ’ according to mr @entity81			2
blow out : intimate family photographs show the president , first lady and their three children celebrating a birthday			0
a former adviser to the @entity91 family said a life of luxury is all that matters to mrs @entity0 extravagant : @entity0 's ( pictured with her children ) outrageous spending came to light last year when she ordered a £ 270,000 chandelier as her husband 's brutal quelling of the @entity1 rebellion intensified he added : ‘ she is convinced her family will rule @entity1 for years to come			1
and she is particularly interested in growing the family wealth and making sure they keep it			0
' she wants to be certain her son , @entity125 , will take over as president one day , even if this means hiding him in a school or college in @entity130 or @entity131 for a time			0
’ of her recent purchases , mr @entity81 said : ‘ @entity0 has no heart			1
she is obsessed by how chic and beautiful she looks			0
she continues to lead a life of utter luxury			0
that ’s all that matters to her			0
’ other insiders , who do not want to be named , claim that @entity0 now travels with at least three @entity142 bodyguards whenever she goes out and is prevented from seeing any @entity5 news , or from surfing the internet , in case she finds coverage of the @entity1 crisis ‘ depressing			1
’ another critic of the regime , who can not be named for political reasons , said : ‘ @entity0 still loves her shopping and buys as much as she can to keep her mind off the chaos around her			2
the idea that she is under @entity91 ’s control and ca n’t leave is nonsense , but her ability to watch @entity5 media is strictly controlled			2
’ it is a far cry from march , 2011 , when @entity159 published a fawning piece in which the @entity161 were portrayed as a ‘ wildly democratic ’ couple who had made @entity1 ‘ the safest country in the @entity164 ’			1
dictator : @entity22 secretary of state @entity98 branded mr @entity91 a ' thug and a murderer ' this week as the attacks in @entity1 worsened the article , arranged and managed by an @entity22 pr company , paid for by the @entity1 government , revealed @entity0 ’s love of crystal - encrusted @entity174 shoes and @entity176 dresses and painted her as a fragrant , caring first lady , in the style of the late @entity179			1
it claimed she cared about art , children , and ‘ women ’s issues ’ , and implied she was breathing new life into the region			0
yet at the time of the interview , @entity1 police had just fired live rounds and tear gas at up to 4,000 demonstrators in the southern city of @entity194			2
local reports claimed hundreds of protesters were killed			0
the piece was pilloried and withdrawn from @entity159 ’s website			0
the author , @entity199 , later wrote a more critical review of her visit to @entity84 in @entity202			0
in the family : president @entity91 as a child ( second left ) with his father and former @entity1 president @entity91 ( centre ) she never once saw her eat , she said , and told how on one occasion , when opening a youth centre , @entity0 had told the assembled children it was to close for lack of funding			1
when the children cried in disappointment , @entity0 laughed			2
she was just testing them , she said , to see whether they ‘ cared enough ’ about the project she was setting up			0
@entity219 , an @entity22 scholar who worked with @entity0 on the government - funded magazine @entity220 believes she is in fierce denial			2
‘ there are two sides to @entity0 , ’ he said			0
‘ she is a modern woman , definitely apart from other wives of @entity227 leaders			0
‘ but she also wants to be a princess			0
she ’s standing by her man			0
