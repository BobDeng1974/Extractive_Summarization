instead of happily swimming pet fish , @entity11 and her grandson came upon a nightmarish scene			2

@entity11 went to look at the live fish in the pet department of her @entity3 @entity2 with her grandson
she was *horrified* to discover they were shrouded in *darkness* and full of dead and dying fish
the water was *cloudy* and freezing cold
the power and filtration *systems* had been off for more than a week
a @entity2 representative said the store had not followed protocol
no one was *reprimanded* for the neglect
@entity11 bought any remaining fish that were *n't* too sick and took them home
