right , @entity54 's commemorative scroll the @entity2 was the @entity24 air force 's attempt to gain air superiority over the @entity98 from july to september 1940			0
it was one of the turning points of @entity6 and prevented @entity24 from invading @entity2			0
the battle began in mid-july with @entity102 concentrating on attacking shipping in the @entity104 and attacking coastal towns and defences			0
from august 12 , @entity107 , one of the leaders of the @entity110 regime , shifted his focus to the destruction of the @entity98 , attacking airfields and radar bases			0
( pictured above , @entity98 scrambling to their planes in 1940			0
) convinced that @entity116 was now close to defeat , he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break @entity121 strength			0
but @entity107 grew frustrated by the number of @entity121 planes still fighting off his attacks			0
@entity102 switched tactics again and , on @entity127 's orders , set about destroying @entity128 and other major cities			0
eleven days later , on what became ' @entity131 ' , the @entity98 decimated the huge incoming @entity102 formations in the skies above @entity128 and the south coast			0
@entity76 , of @entity135 , @entity10 , said : ' i do n't know what to do about it			2
' i just could n't understand why a 99 - year - old man would be treated this way			2
' we 've got plenty of proof about his identity , just not the two documents that are required and it seems mad that an exception could n't have been made			2
' the chairman of the @entity82 actually said i could get a passport for my father as they can be issued for free to anyone born before 1928			2
' but when i said that he had lost his previous one , which he had n't seen for 40 years , i was told that would take about six or seven weeks to sort out the paperwork which was far too long a process			2
' it 's just a bit of nonsense i think			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity14 said that two ceremonies were taking place , but the first would be in the departure lounge which would require passport or driving licence identification for visitors to attend			1
