@entity1 senator @entity0 has quizzed defence force top brass over the threat @entity4 - infected suicide terrorists could pose to @entity6 and its military			1
at a @entity11 hearing this morning , the controversial @entity9 senator asked @entity13 @entity12 if the nation 's enemies could launch an attack with the deadly virus			1
officials replied by saying there was no evidence we could come under attack from the hypothetical scourge			2
' ms @entity0 , a former @entity66 soldier , then pressed vice-admiral @entity12 on whether the @entity13 had a contingency plan for the scenario			2
but vice admiral @entity12 said there was no proof militants were capable of attacking @entity6 or its troops with @entity4			1
' i do n't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action , ' he told the hearing			0
he said because of @entity6 's isolation , it would be ' quite difficult ' for a person to enter the country without showing symptoms			2
@entity85 : i was just wondering if i could ask a supplementary on @entity4 , if that 's ok			2
do you have any information to suggest @entity6 's enemies could use attack our country or military using the virus ? for example with suicide agents who are infected by the disease or who have access to bodily fluids containing the disease			1
and what is your contingency plan to fight this ? @entity107 : well , i do n't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action			2
one of the things , @entity114 , that we have playing to our advantage is our geographic ( sic ) isolation			0
and that the length of time that it takes simply to get to @entity6			0
and ( with ) the life cycle of the virus , it becomes very obvious relatively quickly how sick someone is			0
so i think the ability to inject someone into the country who is not showing symptoms would be quite difficult			0
@entity85 : i 'm just asking if you have a contingency plan			0
because if you listen to one side of it , they can say this can take off 10,000 a week , it can hit people by 10,000 a week			0
i just want to know ... is there a contingency plan through the @entity13 to tackle the @entity4 issue			0
are your men and women protected ? @entity107 : senator , our men and women are protected as anyone else in the country is			0
the response to that hypothetical situation would be the response to any outbreak of @entity4 in @entity6			1
our health system has its preparations ready for the virus appearing in the country			0
@entity85 : and so are the civilian doctors and civilian nurses that ... i 'm not sure the ratio between defence and civilian now within that medical corps ... are they prepared to fight the @entity4 alongside the military ? i 'm not sure what their contracts are			1
so are they prepared - do they get to move out if they do not want to fight this if it hits ? how big is the corps , the medical corps , within the armed forces , which is military ? @entity107 : i 'll have to take the exact numbers on notice please			1
in recent months , ms @entity0 , elected to a six - year term in the @entity44 last year , has waded into a number of controversial issues including the debate surrounding the burqa and @entity6 's preparedness for the ebola virus last week , ms @entity0 told @entity187 the ' if you do n't love it , leave ' slogan on this controversial singlet sold at @entity192 did not go far enough ' senator , our men and women are as protected as anyone else in the country is , ' vice admiral @entity12 said			1
@entity4 has been a pet topic for ms @entity0 in recent weeks			1
last friday , ms @entity0 proposed the government set up 'm			2
@entity205 style ' mobile field hospitals to fight @entity4 as part of a virus - fighting ' action plan '			1
according to the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , around 10,000 people could die of the virus each week if it is not brought under control			0
more than 4500 people have died in the three worst hit @entity37 nations of @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 , @entity39 figures said			0
while there have been a number of scares at @entity6 hospitals in recent months - including the case of volunteer @entity223 nurse @entity222 - no @entity6 has reported an infection .			1

senator @entity0 asks defence chiefs if the nation is at risk from @entity4 infected ' suicide agents '
defence chiefs say there is no evidence @entity6 is at risk from hypothetical militants
it comes as she called for 'm . @entity205 - style ' mobile military hospitals to fight the deadly virus here and *abroad* last week
