a @entity1 adventurer is planning to spend an entire year living on the tip of an iceberg off the coast of @entity5			1
explorer @entity6 hopes to stay on the iceberg for up to a year so long as it does not melt too quickly			2
his stay will begin in spring 2015 and will take place @entity11 of @entity5			2
they will also examine other survival factors , such as how the 36 - year - old will gather or store food and the water he will be drinking			0
mr @entity6 's previous feats include running more than 14,000 miles , rowing more than 21,000 miles and spending 560 days in isolation			1
he has rowed both the @entity30 and @entity31 and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control			0
his latest venture was inspired by @entity38 pilot @entity37 who in 1928 flew over the @entity39			0
mr @entity6 says he is aware of the risks involved but is confident he will be home in 12 months ' time but on his return his airship crashed leaving 11 individuals stranded on ice for 40 days			1
mr @entity6 said : ' this adventure will force me to survive and teach me important lessons about this issue			2
' finding the right iceberg - size , shape , position and safety - will be an adventure itself as well as minimising the risk			0
' while he has not yet identified the exact iceberg which will become his new home , he knows he will require one that is flat and is approximately 60metres long and 20metres wide			0
mr @entity6 's previous adventures include spending 560 days in isolation and running more than 14,000 miles he said : ' there is no way to predict the date which the iceberg will have completely melted - it depends on many factors			1
' the iceberg we choose could be either a new one or an old one , carved in the past , but whatever happens , after 12 months i 'll be back home			0
' should the iceberg melt to a size that is too small to continue accommodating him , he 'll use his shelter as a life raft to go adrift and await rescue by a passing ship - which he expects to take seven to 10 days .			1
