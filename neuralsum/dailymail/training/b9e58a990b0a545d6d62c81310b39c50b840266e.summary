it was an instant hit with dealers , and a year later he sold the brand to @entity28 for mass production			0
but besotted by the toy , he put the first set ever made aside to one day pass on to his children or grandchildren			2
the previously unopened set has been preserved in a wooden box at the @entity37 home			0
but when mr @entity18 lay on his death bed in 1998 , suffering from cancer , he told his wife @entity40 his dying wish was to hand the priceless plaything to their daughters , @entity45 and @entity46			1
the plastic and rubber circuit , with this rudimentary controller , was cutting - edge technology the original manual is completely untouched			0
but mr @entity18 vowed to give it to his children after he died the kit comes complete with skid patch oil to maintain the track and car oil to apply to the miniatures finally , after fifteen years , and now with two grandchildren , mrs @entity17 decided this @entity60 was the time to unearth the vintage box from storage to give to @entity63 , four , and @entity64 , two			1
mrs @entity17 , 68 , from @entity65 in @entity66 , said : ' my husband launched @entity4 in 1957 and kept one of the original boxes			2
' it is one of the very first sets ever made and it has been kept in a wooden box which my husband built to safeguard it			0
' after we had our two daughters @entity78 and @entity46 , @entity18 came up with the idea of giving them an original box set when they were older			1

' i felt now was the right time to give my daughters the set			1
' @entity46 and @entity78 grew up playing with various @entity4 sets which they used to set up under the snooker table			0

' @entity4 was born out of @entity18 's company @entity83 which made tin plate toys and models			2

the tracks and cars were built to a scale of 1:30 - and the cars were capable of a scale speed of 130mph			0
