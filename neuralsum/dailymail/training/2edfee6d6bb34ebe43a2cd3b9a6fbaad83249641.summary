by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 @entity1 may have to revert to playing without a striker against @entity3 after their shocking opening game defeat against @entity6 last week			1
here , @entity7 's @entity0 talks tactics and explains the selection problems @entity10 faces ahead of wednesday 's clash			0
could @entity1 revert to playing with no striker ? the hardest thing for @entity1 on wednesday is recovering from the mental scars of that defeat to @entity6			2
@entity10 wo n’t have to make huge tactical changes but after @entity18 ’s poor show , he could bring in @entity19 as a ‘ false nine ’			0
he knows the role well and defenders do n’t like marking empty spaces			0
false nine : @entity19 could be set for a starting spot if @entity1 revert to playing without a striker not good enough : @entity18 could drop to the bench after a poo display against @entity6 key man @entity28 was an inspiration for @entity30 at the end of the season , always popping up with a decisive tackle or goal			1
he has to stand up now and drag everyone with him			0
@entity36 ? if @entity1 stick with a striker , would n’t it be ironic if @entity39 ends up upstaging his soon - to - be @entity41 team - mate @entity18 ? @entity42 : @entity1 leader : @entity28 ( left ) must pick his team up and lead by example against @entity3 in the wings : @entity39 may replace @entity41 - bound @entity18 in the starting line - up video we 're still hurting - @entity10			1

@entity1 could revert to playing without a striker against @entity3
@entity18 may be dropped after a poor *performance* against @entity6
@entity19 could play in the ' false nine ' position for the @entity56 clash
@entity28 must lead by example for @entity1
