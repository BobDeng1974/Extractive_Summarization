@entity1 's £ 8.5 million move to @entity2 dramatically collapsed on sunday after he failed a medical			1
the @entity4 forward had flown out to @entity5 earlier this week after @entity2 had met the release clause in his contract and he had agreed personal terms and a long - term contract before beginning his fitness assessment			1
given @entity2 , who also completed a £ 20million deal for @entity13 on sunday , have been based in unfamiliar surrounds , the medical had taken longer than normal to conduct but when the results came back , @entity2 decided they had no other option but to pull the plug on the move			1
manager @entity23 confirmed the deal was off after @entity2 beat @entity51 champions @entity27 1 - 0 in the @entity37 in @entity28			1
he said : ‘ it 's very simple we have made a decision as a club not to go ahead with the deal			2
it 's unfortunate for the player			2
we are disappointed for the player but there ’s nothing more to be said and we will move on and look at other targets			2
’ having sold @entity64 to @entity65 , they must now decide whether they look for another forward as @entity67 and @entity68 are the only senior strikers			1
they are in the process of sealing a £ 10million deal for @entity73 but the @entity74 forward will be loaned back to @entity75 next year			2
@entity2 have spent close to £ 100million this summer yet they have funds available			1
manager @entity23 , however , will not make a decision in haste , preferring instead to consider his options			1
he may even wait until the winter transfer window to sign a striker			2
confirmed : @entity23 was boosted by the completion of @entity13 's £ 20m move from @entity84 incoming : @entity2 are also close to wrapping up the signing of @entity75 and @entity74 forward @entity73 @entity23 said : ‘ there is money to spend , no question , but i wo n’t spend it for the sake of it			1
it has to be the right type			2
if that means i have to wait until january then that ’s what i will do			2
the players at the moment are in great condition , they are working very well and very hard			2
‘ i have seen the development in some of the young players but if the right ones become available we would like to do something because i still have a lot to do on that front – but if they ’re not available , i will wait			0
’ it is the second blow for @entity23 in the space of 48 hours after he lost @entity109 , his £ 23.6million signing from @entity84 , for six week after he damaged his lateral collateral knee ligaments in training			1
rather than flying back to @entity112 , @entity109 – who does not need surgery – will stay with @entity2 ’s squad for the remainder of their @entity117 tour in order to get to know his new team - mates but there is no disputing his frustration			1
still , @entity23 feels it will not impact on @entity2 too severely			1
disappointment : @entity1 has been left devastated after his proposed £ 8.5m move to @entity47 fell through ‘ last year if someone like @entity109 had gone down it would have really hurt us , ’ @entity23 said			1
‘ it ’s unfortunate for him but thankfully at this stage of the season , where he has got a good level of fitness , which means he can recover quicker			0
‘ he wo n’t be too far away after the start of the season , which is great news			0
this year is vital for us			0
you ’re going to pick up injuries and we need to have the players who can step in and that ’s what we are trying to build			0
’ there was , at least , something positive for @entity23 with the news that his pursuit of @entity13 has reached a successful conclusion			1
the @entity143 international has signed a long - term deal and will link up with @entity2 in either @entity146 or @entity147 , their next stops on this @entity117 tour			1
@entity13 , who has become the most expensive defender in @entity2 ’s history , described the move as a “ dream come true ” and @entity23 believes he has the type of characteristics that will enable his side to vastly improve on the 51 goals they conceded last season in the @entity160			1
the manager believes @entity13 can fill the void left in the back four that has been there since @entity165 retired in 2013			0
@entity23 said : ‘ he 's right footed so he can play on the right but he prefers to play on the left			2
it will depend what needs must			0
the important thing is that we have got the player and we will use him where we feel he needs to be			0
he ’s a player who can still improve			0
meet and greet : @entity23 signs autographs for some of @entity2 's @entity117 - based fans as they played @entity27 in @entity28 pride and passion : @entity2 fans show their colours during the friendly at @entity181 in @entity28 ‘ i think @entity13 is a really commanding central defender			1
i said since we lost @entity165 we needed that leadership and he 's a player who will gives us that			0
he 's strong and can play			0
i was impressed by him when he was at @entity184 and he was a big driving force for @entity84			0
’ @entity13 will join up on @entity2 ’s @entity117 tour either in @entity146 or @entity147 after agreeing a five - year contract and @entity23 believes his squad is now taking shape – and he is no longer mourning the sale of @entity64			1
‘ i ’m really pleased with how it 's all coming along , ’ said @entity23 , who should see @entity73 become a @entity2 player in the next 24 hours , having agreed a £ 10million deal with @entity75			1
‘ our @entity195 players have just come back			0
‘ we have only just been together as a squad over the last week or so			0
i know the group well and i know those coming in will fit what we 're trying to do			2
when the @entity84 game ( at @entity47 on august 17 ) comes up , we will be ready for that			0
' of the performance against @entity27 , @entity23 added : ‘ i was delighted with the team			1
as pre-season goes well , we will be getting sharper in our movements and passing but , at this time , we are building up the resistance of players and getting minutes under the belt			0
‘ in the first half , our passing was crisp and precise			0
we looked real threat at top end of the field			0
i was also very pleased with how we defended			0
we are in good shape and i am delighted			0
