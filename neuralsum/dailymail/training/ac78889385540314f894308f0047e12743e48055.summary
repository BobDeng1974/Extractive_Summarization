the presumed 2016 presidential candidate tried to talk over the noisy group			0

as a senator , @entity0 said she was proud to sponsor federal @entity51 legislation , which would have granted legal status to people who were brought to the @entity29 illegally as children			2

' i 'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform , and i believe that we have to fix our broken immigration system , ' she explained			0

an organizer for @entity107 we dream told @entity109 after the event that more than two dozen supporters of the group were sprinkled throughout the crowd , however			2
' i think she avoided the question like she has in the other events where we ’ve tried to connect with her before , ' the organizer , @entity114 , said			0
' i know that @entity0 is a very intelligent woman and she knows exactly what we are talking about … it ’s not about the @entity51 and it ’s not about immigration reform … it ’s about administrative relief , and so to hear her use that as a cop out to ” avoid answering was frustrating			2
' president @entity65 was similarly interrupted when he appeared in @entity4 on @entity3 's behalf two weeks ago at an early vote rally			1

' and we are ' going to do everything we can to make sure she has every opportunity , good schools , good health			0
' ' we 'll absolutely be committed to making that happen , ' @entity7 said			0
' but then i think about what will it be like for her in 20 , 25 years , when like so many of you , she 's going to be starting her adult life , ' @entity7 told the university students			2
' what will our country be like ? ' she asked			0
' will we will have the commitment to the @entity196 that i was raised with ? @entity3 was raised with ? the feeling that yeah , you had to work hard , you had to get an education , you had to do your part , but the opportunities were going to be there			0
other people were going to be making those investments to give you the chance to live up to your own @entity209 - given potential , ' and have a voice , she said			0
' so of course i want for my granddaughter that type of future , ' she noted , but @entity7 said she also wants other peoples ' children to have those opportunities			0
repeating a now - familiar line in her stump speech , @entity7 said that @entity29 should not have to be the relative of a president or secretary of state to be ensured a fair shake in life			2
