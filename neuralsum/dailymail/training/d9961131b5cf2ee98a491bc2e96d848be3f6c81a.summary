it contains more than 3,000 calories and is stuffed with eight sausages , a kilo of turkey , masses of vegetables and a whole box of stuffing			0
this is surely @entity10 's largest ever @entity9 sandwich , and one cafe in @entity12 will give you a year 's supply of bacon butties if you can wolf it down in under 45 minutes			1
but is doubtful you would ever want to see another bap again if you managed to rise to the challenge			2
giant : the almighty @entity9 bloomer , which a @entity12 cafe is challenging its customers to eat in 45 minutes , contains more than 3,000 calories and dwarfs a normal sandwich gut - buster : chef @entity24 shows off the @entity9 feast , which is about 16ins in length and has eight layers the gut - busting bloomer , priced at £ 15 , is packed with potatoes , sprouts , six carrots , the sausages wrapped in bacon , the turkey meat , stuffing , a whole jar of cranberry sauce - all wrapped in an 800g loaf of bread			1
not only that , the challenge comes with a boat of gravy , a 450g christmas pudding and a pint - and - a - half of tea			0
the owners of the @entity47 cafe in @entity48 , @entity12 , @entity49 , 29 , and @entity24 , 31 , decided to come up with the idea in the spirit of @entity9			1
up for the challenge : taxi driver @entity52 prepares to get stuck in but understandably looks intimidated when chef @entity24 presents him with a pint - and - a - half of tea , a @entity9 pudding and a boat of gravy beast : cabbie tries to get mouth around the butty , which is wrapped in a whole loaf of bread @entity49 said : ' we wanted to make a good challenge with food and so we thought we would do a twist on the traditional @entity9 dinner			0
' we serve bacon , egg and sausage type butties to a great bunch of customers and we thought why do n't we give them a @entity9 dinner butty ? ' it takes around two hours to prepare so people need to order it in advance and there 's the pudding and tea to have with it			1
tuck in : mr @entity52 prepares to eat the festive feast , which contains more than 3,000 calories ' anyone brave enough to take up the challenge will get a free bacon butty every week for a year			1
@entity9 is about eating a lot and this butty will make sure anyone is stuffed			0
' customer and taxi driver @entity52 , 47 , was the first to try the jumbo creation but admitted he could n't quite complete it			0
he said : ' i could n't manage it but i 'm sure there will be someone out there up for the challenge			2
' mind - boggling : the artery - stretching sandwich contains enough ingredients to feed a family of four			0
