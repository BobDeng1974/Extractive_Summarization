by @entity0 this whole @entity1 looked like it was set up for @entity2 to become the scapegoat			1
but he answered his critics with a fine performance against @entity7			1
he was our silver lining			2
@entity9 said the nation had an obssession with @entity2 , but he fuelled it by sticking him out on the left wing for the @entity15 game after two years of playing him through the middle			1
an innovator , a coach who would switch tactics and change it around			2
the players loved playing for him			0
@entity20 have spent 20 years trying to find someone like him — and have n’t			0
my favourite @entity42 ’s goal against @entity43 in @entity44			0
i was on the pitch with him , joined in the dentist chair celebration … the goal was genius and the celebration was fun			0
the @entity54 man - marked him at @entity55			1
the @entity54 ! shows you how good he was			0
strikers are sensitive types and if you doubt them , you ’ve lost them			0
playing on the wing would have been a kick in the teeth for @entity2 , but he picked himself up and delivered when the whole country was waiting for him to fail			1
he put in a shift , worked hard and was unlucky not to have a hat - trick			2
he was @entity20 ’s most dangerous player			0
@entity67 is being sold to @entity68 for £ 30million and looked half the player @entity2 did			1
imagine the hounding he would have received if he had done what @entity71 did : come off with a dead leg against @entity15 with @entity20 losing — then start the next game a few days later			1
instead , @entity2 got on with his job			1
there ’s no point comparing him to @entity81 — who is a freak of nature — but we should cherish him			0
@entity84 in hands : @entity2 ca n't hide his disappointment as @entity20 blew it early exit : @entity88 , @entity2 and @entity71 trudge off			2

@entity9 played @entity2 out of position on the left against @entity15
@entity94 man responded and was *biggest* threat to @entity7
@entity2 broke his @entity1 duck with second - half tap in
