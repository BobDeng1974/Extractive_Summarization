it was a case of practice makes perfect for @entity2 as she wore her best courtroom outfit to date on wednesday			1
the former x factor judge was in court to appeal against a conviction for punching the celebrity blogger @entity7 at the 2013 @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , as he followed her to a @entity12 for a party			1
but judge @entity16 , sitting at the appeal hearing at @entity15 , refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and threw out the appeal			1
@entity2 , 26 , made of string of appearances in court in 2014 , when she was cleared of arranging a drugs deal and also found guilty of assaulting a celebrity blogger			1
but although the results of the two cases were remarkably different , there was one constant - @entity2 's mismatched sense of style			1
she finally transformed her look for her appearance at @entity15 yesterday though in a thick black cape with ladylike striped dress beneath			1
@entity2 wore a thick black cape with ladylike striped dress			1
the hemline and loose fit were more demure than her previous outfits for her court appearances last year the knee - length hemline and loose fit were demure enough for court , and made a stark change to the tight , thigh - length ensembles of 2014			2
the singer also injected some glamour with red patent platform heels and her long black hair worn loose			0
on her arm , she carried a large leather tote with ruched detailing and she also wore a simple pendant necklace			0
in court , the pop star was found guilty of hitting mr @entity7 , who she suspected of putting her sex tape online , at the 2013 @entity8 in @entity9 as he followed her to a @entity12 for a party			0
judge @entity16 , sitting at the appeal hearing , refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and said she ' lost control '			0
the singer injected some glamour with her long black hair worn down - and red patent platform heels during her days in court in @entity75 attempted something of a style overhaul , smartening up her look with an array of trouser suits , high - collared silk blouses and formal frocks - often very different from her usual look			2
previously the singer was often seen in revealing bandage dresses and shorts skirts but she meant business as she stood up in court in super-smart attire			0
she ditched her usual style of cleavage - baring outfits and chunky gold jewellery in favour of a demure , no - nonsense image			2
but the singer unfailingly messed up the look every time , whether the the dress was too short , the coat and dress mismatched or the suit was simply too cheap - looking			0
@entity2 has clearly learnt from her fashion mistakes though			2
@entity2 wore a navy trouser suit with a white lace blouse to hear court ruling on assault charges on july 25 @entity2 departing court after facing drug charges at @entity107 in july , 2014 last year , when @entity2 faced drug charges in relation to a story that appeared in @entity111 at @entity107 , she took the case very seriously , attending every single hearing regardless of whether she was required to or not			1
during this time , she experimented with hair colour , heel height and hem length			0
but each time , it terms of style , the outfits never quite worked			2
often , she matched a light pastel with a harsh black , creating a half - finished look			0
@entity2 in a pale pink drop hem dress and a shoulder - padded jacket at her drugs trial on thursday , july 17 @entity2 sports a black and white look on july 16 , 2014 , during her cocaine supply trial , and in a more casual look of floral dress and long side pony on july 15 , 2014 one of her strangest looks was on june 27 , when @entity2 marched into court in a pistachio green trouser suit , teamed with nude stilettos and a button - down blouse featuring a chain - link print design			1
a few days later , the star relaxed her image and she wore her hair in a long side ponytail and dressed in a floaty short dress			0
the Â£ 150 @entity144 style featured a watercolour tree print , contrast trim and belt , three quarter sleeves and button fastening			0
@entity2 on july 14 2014 in her drugs trial ( left ) wearing a floral knee - length number , and in court charged with assault , @entity155 on july 2 ( right ) , in a black top and trousers with a cream jacket but the pale blue blazer that she added at the last minute was too bright next to the black on both the dress and handbag			1
her appearances in court in late 2013 and early 2014 were much better as the star stuck to a simpler wardrobe			0
her all - black outfits , accompanied with a blonde hairstyle left little chance for faults			0
it was only when @entity2 branched out during the summer months that her outfits started to falter			2
@entity2 marched into court in a tailored pistachio green trouser suit , teamed with nude shoes and chain - link print blouse , on june 27 , 2014 ( left ) and opted for giant platform shoes and all - black look on april 22 ( right ) @entity2 at the beginning of her string of court appearances on jan 9 2014 ( l ) and on dec 19 , 2013 ( r ) - sticking to an easier look of long blonde hair , mega heels and all - black clothing			1

@entity2 wore a black cape and striped dress to @entity15 crown court
