@entity1 players arrived back home to a depressing welcome after a dismal @entity4 , with no one even bothering to collect star player @entity6 from the airport			1
the @entity8 fared only slightly better than @entity9 , claiming four points to finish third in a group containing @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 but still being eliminated before the business end of the tournament begins in @entity17			1
@entity6 also failed to live up to his billing as the best player on the planet - after struggling with injuries ahead of the tournament he returned to spend most of his games pouting petulantly at teammates before scoring his now customary single @entity4 goal ( in the final 2 - 1 victory against @entity14 )			1
after bidding farewell to teammates including @entity55 , the current @entity58 winner - sporting a shiner under his left eye - cut a disconsolate figure as he trudged towards a public taxi rank before throwing his bag in the boot like an average tourist and leaving alone			2
thumbing a lift : @entity66 winger @entity55 leaves the airport with his head held low coach trip : @entity1 boss @entity70 manages a wink as he leaves the @entity33 dream is over : @entity73 ( r ) hugs @entity1 goalkeeper @entity74 as they bid their farewells after a dismal tournament @entity1 players attempted to dismiss their lacklustre performance by trotting out some time honoured cliches associated with early exits			1
' that 's football , we are leaving our heads held high , ' offered @entity6			2
' we tried out best and we did n't succeed			0
' @entity66 winger @entity55 was singing from the same hymn sheet when he said : ' our aim was to leave with our heads held high			2
petulant : @entity6 spent most of his time complaining at his teammate 's inability to find him customary : the @entity93 superstar has scored a single goal at each of the last three @entity96 exit strategy : @entity1 were eliminated at the group stage after claiming four points ' we could n't afford to make the same mistakes again , ' said defender @entity73 , who was sent off against @entity12 and did not enlarge on what the mistakes were			1
' we wanted to go through to the next stage , we tried our best but unfortunately , it was n't possible			0
we fought hard but we did n't get there			0
' midfielder @entity107 was the only player who offered any sort of insight when he complained about the heat in @entity111 where @entity1 drew with the @entity13			1
' i was tired after 30 minutes , although i know that the conditions were the same for everyone , so it 's not an excuse , " he said			0
grounds for complaint ? @entity107 defended @entity1 's decision to train in the @entity13 @entity107 also addressed the vexed issue of why @entity1 had gone to train in the @entity13 for 10 days before the @entity4 , instead of preparing in @entity17			1
' the conditions there were very similar to @entity123 ( @entity1 's training camp in @entity17 ) , " he said			2
' people are asking questions about this now because things did not go well			0
' but there was no suggestion that anything else had gone wrong			0
' we have an excellent team who can beat any opponent , and two years ago we came within a whisker of reaching the @entity138 final			0
we mus n't now throw everything away and say that we are the worst			0

@entity8 eliminated from group including @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14
@entity6 cut a lonely figure as he hailed a public cab home
@entity93 star failed to *inspire* his side and scored a solitary goal
@entity55 , @entity73 and @entity107 offered excuses for @entity1 's exit
