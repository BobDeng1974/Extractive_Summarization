the pleasure of growing sunflowers is about to reach new heights – with the arrival of a new seed that guarantees 17ft plants			2
@entity7 - fingered pensioner @entity6 has spent 30 years painstakingly developing a new species called ' @entity9 ' by selecting the seeds of the tallest sunflower from a crop and growing them on the following year			1
she repeated the process over three decades until the sunflowers grew to an average height of 17ft			1
@entity6 spent 30 years painstakingly developing a new species called ' @entity9 ' the main reason for the bright yellow plant 's dependable growth is that it does n't flower until late august or early september , giving it all of the summer to grow			1
while some other varieties have been known to grow to similar heights , they are rare and freak occurrences whereas the @entity9 variety is consistently tall			0
packets of seeds of the new species , described on the packet as ' possibly the tallest sunflower ever produced ' , have now gone on sale for £ 2.99			1
mrs @entity6 , 70 , who is being credited with breeding @entity9 on the packet but is not taking any royalties from the sales , who regularly opens the gardens at her @entity38 listed house to the public under the @entity40			1
she said yesterday : ‘ in september time there was n't a lot to see , especially for children , so i decided to start growing sunflowers			0
‘ as each year went by i used the seeds from the tallest one and planted them again the year later			1
i did this for 30 years until they consistently reached 17ft			1
the main reason for the bright yellow plant 's dependable growth is that it does n't flower until late august or early september ‘ people are amazed at the size of them			2
’ mrs @entity6 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , is a member of the @entity55 's herbaceous plant committee and mentioned her project colleague @entity56			1
he sent a kilogram of the seeds to a production farm in @entity60 where they have been mass - grown for the @entity63 climate and the seeds from the flower heads placed in packets ready for sale			2
mr @entity56 , 57 , said : ‘ because it is sunny and dry in @entity60 it is great for flowers			0
‘ each sunflower produced between 100 and 150 seeds so from the ones we planted we had millions			1
‘ @entity74 is taller than other varieties because it only flowers when the days become shorter in september time , meaning it has much longer to grow than those that flower in june			0
’ @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , has been given the exclusive rights to sell @entity9 in the @entity63			0
to ensure the sunflowers reach their potential , seeds need to be planted in april and spaced two feet apart			2
although the height on the front of packet states 15ft , a spokesman for @entity81 said they may need to increase that figure in the near future			0
he said : ‘ the variety of sunflowers that are usually planted in the @entity63 are the @entity96 , which reach an average of around 12ft tall			0
‘ @entity74 variety will reach 17ft in height , possibly more , as long as they are sown in april , given the opportunity to climb and flower , and fed and watered regularly			0
’ he added : ‘ these sunflowers are great for wildlife as they have pollen so they attract bees and other creatures			0
‘ the best thing about the @entity9 sunflowers is that they are @entity63 bred , they have been specifically grown in the @entity63 climate			0
