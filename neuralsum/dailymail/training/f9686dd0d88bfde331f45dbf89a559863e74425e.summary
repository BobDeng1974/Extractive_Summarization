@entity8 , 69 , stirred controversy last month when she said of young singers : ‘ sometimes they ’re more beautiful than their voice , and that ’s a bit of a sadness			1
’ she added : ‘ when i was at the @entity18 [ in @entity19 ] , i would see these young girls , starving hungry but terrified to put on weight			2

‘ you have got to have beef on you if you ’re going to sing			0
’ @entity2 , 23 , who has sung for the queen six times in the past year , said : ‘ it is so stupid she has highlighted body stuff			1
‘ i find it strange that she is commenting on girls ’ figures			0
’ ‘ she pointed out sexualisation of young women in the classical industry and that frustrates me			2
‘ i just received my first - class degree at the @entity44 and at no point in my four - year course did my figure come into it			0
‘ for me it is about being healthy , i ’m not thin or enormous , but just a sporty shape			0
i look after my vocal muscles and my other muscles as well and i do n’t feel the pressure to diet to go on stage thin			0
’ the divas ’ disagreement comes as both women take to the stage tonight in the last of the @entity58 evenings at @entity59			0
