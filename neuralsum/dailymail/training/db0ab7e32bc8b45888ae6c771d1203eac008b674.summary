by @entity0 fresh from his drive to victory in last sunday 's @entity3 - the so - called ' @entity4 ' - it is back to school for @entity6			1
for the 2008 world champion is finding out as much data as possible on his @entity10 team - mate @entity9 , who was second , in an attempt to give him the edge in their embryonic , but captivating , duel for the world title			1
@entity6 , thinking ahead to the next race in @entity18 on april 20 , said : ' someone in the team did a huge study on my pace in @entity24 ( the previous race , which he won comprehensively )			1
as we arrived in @entity27 , @entity9 had this big document showing all the places where i was quick , and he used that to his advantage			2
up for the cup : @entity6 sealed back - to - back victories after holding off @entity9 for the @entity27 win @entity35 moment : @entity6 is drenched by his team after winning the @entity27 @entity3 @entity38 : @entity40 ( right ) and @entity41 greatest rivalry ever			1
@entity40 won the 1988 title ahead of his team - mate but lost in 1989			1
he was disqualified in the penultimate race after a crash with @entity46			0
@entity46 won the title and left for @entity48			0
@entity48 : @entity50 ( right ) and @entity51 1982 at @entity52 , @entity49 passed @entity50 to win			0
two weeks later , the @entity53 died in qualifying in @entity55 with some claiming he was desperate to beat @entity58 € ™ s time			0
@entity59 : @entity61 ( right ) and @entity62 1987 the pair won nine of 16 races but @entity61 crashed in @entity65 to rule him out of the final two races and @entity67 won the title			0
' so now i 'll do the same and hopefully i can capitalise			0
' i have to study hard and work hard over these next two weeks			0
i 'm going to be giving it a lot of digestion			0
' but will this approach work for @entity6 ? a senior engineer who knows the driver well told me privately that @entity6 is at his best when he leaves the engineering to the engineers			1
he said @entity6 gives excellent feedback - his feel is intuitive - but that he could overcomplicate matters when not simply answering the engineers ' questions and leaving the solution to them			2
@entity9 still leads the standings by 11 points having won the opening race in @entity88 and come second in the next two			1
@entity6 has had one non-finish and two first places			2
what will further spice the season up is that @entity10 will permit their drivers to race against each other , where sense allows			0
team orders - which are now allowed , alas - will not be deployed readily			2
sunday was a case in point : the drivers were told to take care but to get on with it			0
this freedom served up a brilliant contest over the last 10 laps , with @entity6 somehow defying @entity9 's attempts to pass on him on the supposedly fastest tyre compound			1
battle : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity9 went wheel - to - wheel for the race victory in @entity27 @entity111 , @entity10 's technical director , said : ' @entity112 has a very long history in motorsport and i think this is just part of the philosophy that we want to let our drivers race			1
' it 's the spirit of @entity122 and motor racing generally			0
team orders , putting in artificial constraints , are just terrible for the spectacle			0
' so we believe that we should let the guys race , particularly in a situation where we have a pretty dominant car - it 's become clear of that now - it 's all the more important to keep providing that entertainment and excitement for all of us			2
' on track : @entity9 briefly got ahead of @entity6 , but the @entity138 snatched back the lead on the same lap moment to celebrate : @entity6 is embraced by his @entity10 team after winning his second consecutive race the prospect is mouth - watering because internal team rivalries have served up @entity122 's most memorable seasons			1
there was @entity61 v @entity67 and @entity6 v @entity149			2
but the most relevant parallel is the 1988 season , during the previous turbo era , when @entity38 's @entity46 and @entity40 won all but one race in a ding - dong duel .			1

@entity6 won the @entity3 after duel with @entity9
the 2008 world champion will now study @entity9 's data from the race
however , senior engineer , who knows @entity6 well , says he is at his best when he leaves the engineering to the engineers
@entity6 trails team - mate @entity9 in the championship by 11 points
