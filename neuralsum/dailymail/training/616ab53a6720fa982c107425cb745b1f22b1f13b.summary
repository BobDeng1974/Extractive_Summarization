by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ after 22 minutes and 30 seconds of pure gold in front of a microphone from @entity6 , the @entity2 striker stood up to deliver one final line			1
' i 'm sure you 'll all have your own views as to what to make of that , ' he declared after a bravura performance in front of the assembled media			0
he spoke with utter conviction			0
' i am going to enjoy this tournament because i have n't enjoyed the last ones , ' he admitted			0
' i 'm going to take positive memories			0
' it all came tumbling out , just like it did when he visited @entity2 's team psychiatrist dr @entity35			1
' yes , i 've been to see him a few times , ' he added			0
there was no holding back , which is just the way we like it from the man who can turn a game with a swivel of his hips or a ping off that @entity47 boot			0
@entity6 warmed up by putting away @entity48 with a feisty attack , hinting at jealousy after he signed a new five - year contract worth Â£ 250,000 a week at @entity52			1
by the end , @entity6 was at full throttle			1
' he 's been a great player at @entity57 , but i 've never had his phone number and he 's never had mine , ' revealed @entity6			1
fighting fit : @entity6 looks in good shape at @entity2 training as he jogs alongside his team - mates ' i 'm sure he has upset a lot of people at @entity57 because they see me worthy of signing a new deal at the club , so obviously they have got a different opinion to what @entity48 has			1
the criticism was a bit strange , but he has his opinions and he 's entitled to them			1
it was very , very strange , but i 'm sure he has his reasons			2
' i do n't agree with them , but he 's probably the best player i 've ever played with so i 'm not going to knock him as a player			2
' next up were the @entity85			0
@entity6 has played against the great catenaccio defences in the past for club and country , and is convinced that there is nothing to fear from @entity93 pairing @entity92 and @entity94			1
' if i 'm being honest , when you play a high tempo they have struggled , ' he added			2
' the @entity85 league is nowhere near the tempo of the @entity101			0
even when we played @entity104 , with @entity105 and @entity106 as centre halves , they really struggled when we played a high tempo			0
if we can do that we can give them problems			0
' @entity6 has convinced himself that this @entity2 team is better than the ' golden generation ' who reached the quarter - final in 2006 or the decrepit 2010 team beaten 4 - 1 by @entity117 in @entity118			1
' the @entity85 players should be looking at us and how they can control our team , ' he added			2
' we 're not really too focused on @entity121			0
' he has been a fantastic player and @entity122 have some great players , but so have we			1
water break : @entity2 players have been taking on plenty of fluids in the heat of @entity24 ' they should be more worried about our team			1
it is exciting and the young players bring a lot of energy and excitement			0
you can see with @entity135 and @entity136 that there 's no fear with them			2
they 'll be good players , big players for us			0
' this is probably the best squad of players i 've been involved with since i 've been with @entity2			1
' that was an extraordinary claim , particularly with so little expectation around this group of players , but at least @entity6 believed what he was saying			1
he was giving the world what they wanted to hear ahead of saturday 's @entity156 clash			1
when the subject of 2010 and the mouthful he gave @entity2 fans as he walked off the field at the @entity161 in @entity162 after a 0 - 0 draw with @entity164 came up , he sounded genuinely remorseful			1
' of course i regret it , ' he added			0
' it was in the heat of the moment			0
it was stupid of me , i understand that , but it was a frustrating time			0
' i 'll do my best for @entity2 and i 'm sure the fans see that			1
i 'm sure the @entity57 fans who are @entity2 fans like me			1
' @entity177 in @entity178 was a traumatic experience for @entity6			2
he admitted he struggled to cope without his family			0
on the ball : @entity6 says he is sharp and eager to prove the doubters wrong in @entity185 on my head : the players look in good spirits as they go through their training routine ' the hardest thing about last time was that i missed my family and this time i 've learned to deal with that , ' he added			2
this time they will travel to @entity185 to watch @entity6 in tournament conditions			2
last month his son @entity197 was in @entity198 with @entity6 's father - in - law , @entity199 , to watch him undergo a rigorous fitness schedule before the @entity2 team met up in the prestigious @entity202 do @entity204 resort			1
' he 's not a massive football fan to be honest , he 's not really into it at the minute , ' revealed @entity6			1
' at the end of last season , when i walked out at @entity52 the fans were shouting my name and he was asking why			0
' @entity197 , who is only four , will discover in time that his dad remains one of the biggest talents in @entity215 football			0
@entity6 's edge is back , the element of aggression that set him apart when he emerged at @entity219 and embedded himself in the @entity215 game			1
' @entity221 did n't call me - i went to see him , ' @entity6 explained			1
' he gave me his honest opinion and he felt i had lost a bit of aggression , which i was asked to do ( by sir @entity225 )			0
down in the dumps : @entity227 looked upset as he missed @entity2 training with a thigh strain tick tock : @entity231 knows time is running out for him to finalise his team and tactics for the game against @entity122 in doubt : @entity6 's place in @entity2 's starting line - up at the @entity18 has been questioned ' i thought about it and it was n't really me			1
i 've always responded well in the dressing room if i 'm not doing well			0
if someone shouts at me i have no problem with that			0
' @entity6 has done so much in his career , winning five @entity101 titles and the @entity248 with @entity57			1
incredibly , he has yet to score at a @entity18			0
' if you look at my record in the @entity18 qualifiers i had a pretty good record ( seven goals )			0
' that 's what i have to do at the @entity18			2
i want to score goals and help @entity2 be successful , but i honestly feel better than i have done for years			2
' i 'm ready for this tournament and i know if i play my game i will do well			2
' doing well here means supplying goals and scoring them as @entity2 negotiate a tricky group involving @entity122 , @entity263 and @entity264			1
although @entity6 is yet to get off the mark at a @entity18 , he is one goal behind equalling @entity267 ( 40 goals ) and 10 behind the great sir @entity269 in an @entity2 shirt			1
' at my age i should break the record , but i just want to keep playing and trying to score			0
if i can get to sir @entity269 's record it would be a massive achievement and i would be absolutely delighted			2
' when he gets there , everyone will have a view on it .			0
