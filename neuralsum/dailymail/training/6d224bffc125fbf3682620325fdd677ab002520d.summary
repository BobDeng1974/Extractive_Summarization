@entity2 community leaders in @entity3 were complicit in hushing up the shocking ‘ ethnic ’ dimensions of the sexual exploitation rather than speaking out , it was claimed yesterday			1
@entity6 , director of the @entity7 in @entity3 , revealed the shocking issue was widely discussed between leaders who were privately ‘ trying to resolve the problem ’			1
she refused to name those who kept quiet , but was certain the problem of @entity14 men abusing white girls was known ‘ for a long time ’			0
speaking to @entity24 , she said : ‘ it was discussed , a discussion was going on in the community with community leaders and organisations and other agencies who were aware of what was happening and were trying to resolve the problem			1
’ no councillors or religious leaders from the @entity27 have spoken in the media since the report ’s publication on tuesday			1
mrs @entity6 works daily at the centre for the significant @entity2 community in the @entity42 town			1
commenting on local knowledge about horrific cases of young girls being exploited by sexual predators , she said : ‘ it was not started overnight it was going on for a long time			0
‘ it was always discussed in the community			2
’ ms @entity6 later appeared to backtrack on her statement , claiming she intended to say the report revealed senior council workers evidently knew about the scandal			2
@entity6 , head of the @entity7 , said the scandal was widely discussed within the @entity14 community some 3 per cent of the town ’s population is of @entity2 or @entity60 ethnicity and mrs @entity6 said it was vital to ‘ raise awareness ’ with families			1
the abuse of at least 1,400 girls at the hands of @entity2 gangs in the @entity42 town for 16 years was shrouded in secrecy			1
yesterday @entity70 , who has lived in @entity3 for most of his life , said it was now up to the ‘ mosques and community leaders ’ to teach ‘ moral and ethical values ’ lost to the younger generation			2
bosses at @entity78 have tried time and again to stop information about sexual abuse becoming public			0
after one report was passed to the media in 2012 , senior executives ordered that ‘ document control ’ be tightened as they sought to find the leak			0
the council also considered taking out an injunction against a newspaper , minutes reveal			0
and @entity90 , head of children ’s services at the council , was reluctant to disclose reports about the abuse when called before the @entity96 last year			2
she only agreed after chairman @entity97 insisted his committee had ‘ the power to call for papers ’			0
even former education secretary @entity101 reprimanded the authority in 2012 for ‘ unnecessarily ’ redacting a review			0
@entity70 , a member of the @entity104 who was @entity3 ’s first @entity14 councillor , said yesterday : ‘ i am deeply shocked by these heinous despicable crimes committed by young @entity2 men			2
‘ i do think that there ’s a huge amount of responsibility that lies on the shoulders of the mosques and the community leaders because they are responsible for teaching ethical values and respect			0
‘ i came to @entity3 in 1969 when the first mosque was opened and we were taught moral and ethical values and mixed with the community			2
‘ if someone had a call from the police , people would be embarrassed and ashamed			0
’ he said he was now ‘ worried for @entity3 ’ in the wake of the child abuse scandal			1
he added : ‘ the majority of @entity129 @entity2 men are stuck between criminals involved in these problems and a few hundred that are involved with other issues like terrorism or other criminal activity			0
’ his comments come amid calls for senior council workers in charge between 1997 and 2013 to resign from their current posts both at @entity3 and elsewhere			1
the shameless buck - passing between council chiefs continued today even as detectives were urged to finally hunt down the child rapists who they allowed to escape justice for 16 years			1
among the officials shrugging off responsibility was police and crime commissioner @entity149 , who stubbornly defied demands for his resignation from the home secretary			0
report : professor @entity155 's report revealed 1,400 girls had been abused by mainly @entity2 gangs for 16 years under pressure : @entity149 ( left ) and @entity90 ( right ) are facing calls to step down over the scandal even his deputy @entity161 has now resigned - and urged her boss to do the same			1
ms @entity161 said she said she felt ' unable to continue ' in the role and added : ' it is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and , with this in mind , i believe it would have been the right thing for @entity149 to resign			0
' it came as education secretary @entity175 also announced that @entity176 would carry out an early inspection of child protection services in @entity3			0
prime minister @entity179 is among those calling for mr @entity149 to quit , describing the report into 16 years of widespread child abuse in the @entity42 town as ' deeply shocking '			1
he said : ' i think the home secretary [ @entity186 ] was right yesterday to say , having looked at the report , the fact that the police commissioner was at the time head of children 's services , that the right decision would be to resign and take full responsibility for what happened			0
' and shockingly , the woman in charge of @entity3 's children 's services for five years of the child sex abuse scandal tried to downplay the true scale of the offences .			1

1,400 girls were abused by @entity2 gangs in @entity3 for 16 years
@entity2 community workers said abuse scandal was ' discussed '
she said religious leaders were ' *contacted* by agencies about the abuses '
but they ' discussed it at the mosque ' rather than going to the police
comes as council officers face calls to step down over the report
