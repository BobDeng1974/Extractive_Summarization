by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 05:53 est , 20 march 2012 @entity1 vowed to tear up 60 years of planning law to build new towns and give @entity4 another airport in the @entity6			1
the prime minister unveiled plans for a wave of new ‘ garden cities ’ – quickly dubbed ‘ @entity11 ’ – and gave his strongest support yet for a new ‘ @entity17 ’ airport in the @entity14 , heavily promoted by @entity16 mayor @entity15			1
accepting there would be ‘ costs and protests ’ , mr @entity1 shrugged off opposition to the planning overhaul , saying he wants a @entity24 - style blitz on new infrastructure building to boost growth			1
' @entity27 ' : @entity1 is planning to create more ' @entity28 ' like @entity30 's @entity29 , pictured he warned that failure to act would condemn @entity4 to being a second - rate nation			1
but his plans were quickly condemned by rural groups and green campaigners as a blueprint for ‘ disfiguring ’ the countryside that would damage the fabric of @entity4			1
in a speech at the @entity41 in @entity16 , the prime minister vowed to overcome what he called a ‘ failure of nerve ’ on planning			2
mr @entity1 rejected calls by groups such as the @entity48 to tear up its new @entity49 , due shortly , saying it would provide ‘ the biggest simplification of our bureaucratic , top - down planning laws in 60 years ’			1
he said the government would protect green belts and national parks , but added : ‘ we also urgently need to find places where we are prepared to allow significant new growth to happen			1
’ determined : the @entity39 shrugged off opposition to the planning overhaul , saying he wants a @entity24 - style blitz on new infrastructure building to boost growth vowing to recreate a ‘ visionary plan ’ from 1944 to build new towns across the @entity6 , mr @entity1 said : ‘ the growth of our towns and cities has been held back by a planning system which has encouraged development of the wrong sort in the wrong places			1
’ he said places such as @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity29 were ‘ not perfect but popular ’ and the coalition would seek to build more towns that were ‘ green , planned , secure , with gardens , places to play and characterful houses , not just car - dominated concrete grids ’			1
mr @entity1 said the government would begin consulting later this year ‘ on how to apply the principles of garden cities to areas with high potential growth , in places people want to live ’			1
he added : ‘ we must get our planning system fit for purpose			2
it needs to be quick			2
it needs to be easier to use			2
and it needs to better support growth , jobs and homes			2
’ the prime minister said the government needed to be similarly ‘ bold ’ about air transport too			2
risking a fresh row with the @entity103 , who oppose all airport expansion in the @entity6 , he said : ‘ i ’m not blind to the need to increase airport capacity , particularly in the @entity6			0
‘ we need to retain our status as a key global hub for air travel , not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere , in @entity113 , @entity114 or @entity115			0
’ the @entity116 have ruled out a third runway at @entity118 but mr @entity1 made warm noises about building a new international hub airport @entity121			1
‘ yes , this will be controversial			0
we will be bringing forward options in our aviation strategy which will include an examination of the pros and cons of a new airport in the @entity14			0
’ he praised @entity15 , saying he had ‘ done very well in driving forward this agenda ’			0
mr @entity1 also unveiled £ 150million of new investment in ‘ shovel ready ’ building projects that already have planning permission but are stalled by lack of investment			1
chancellor @entity135 will also be announcing ten ‘ super-connected ’ cities that are to have universal access to super-fast broadband as part of the drive to improve telecommunications			0
@entity142 , director of policy for the @entity143 , attacked the plans for building in the countryside			0
he said : ‘ if the government ’s planning reforms remain unchanged from the draft published last year , pressure for sprawling development is precisely what we can expect			0
‘ unless the final planning framework recognises the intrinsic value of our countryside as a whole , we fear a rash of sporadic and inappropriate development across the country , disfiguring the rural landscape which is so valued by local communities			0
’ but mr @entity1 vowed to stand up to the critics			1
‘ there will be costs and protests			0
and i am certainly not doing it in the hope of immediate political advantage , ’ he said			0
‘ i can see the furious objections – the banner headlines – already			0
’ but he added : ‘ we will take difficult decisions , we will risk short - term unpopularity			0
‘ we will hold fast to our vision in the face of vested interests , because our motivation and our duty is to protect and champion the national interest			0
