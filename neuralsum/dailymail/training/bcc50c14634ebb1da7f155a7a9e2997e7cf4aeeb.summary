from filthy clothes dangling from broken coat hangers to beds riddled with mould , these abandoned hotels are a world away from their luxurious past			1
the venues are spread across the @entity8 - but many owners still keep the exact location secret to protect them from being vandalised or looted			0
one of the reasons owners are afraid of looting is that some of the spooky locations still have the likes of tv installed			0
in its final days it was an assisted living home for the elderly but was seized by the city for unpaid taxes in this more modern hotel room , the walls and ceiling are deteriorating rapidly while the plastic in the television set still looks new ; plastic does not biodegrade like other materials photographer @entity41 , from @entity42 , @entity21 , spent six years travelling the @entity43 between 2007 and 2013 taking photos of the abandoned hotels			1

' most of my finds are either through research , networking with others or dumb luck			0
' all three are represented in these buildings - some i just stumbled across but most were places i was either made aware of through friends and business contacts or hunted down information on prior to visiting			0
' i photograph any sort of site i can manage access to and i would love to spend more time with abandoned hotels and resorts because there are still so many out there			2
