another excerpt read out from the report stated that the reaction @entity0 had on the night he killed ms @entity44 might seem ' seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of an able - bodied person , but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history '			1
at times during his trial , @entity0 has wailed and retched in apparent distress , particularly during graphic testimony about the shooting and also when the athlete was on the witness stand			1
at other times , he has been calm and taken notes			0

he quoted a study that found that adults with disabilities are at a higher risk of violent attacks			0
he added that the athlete has a hand tremor as well as a sleep disorder that required medication			0

the defense called @entity24 to the stand in an attempt to bolster @entity0 ' account that he mistook @entity44 for an intruder , providing testimony about a loving relationship and a fear of crime that may have pushed the paralympian to fire through a closed toilet door			1
@entity129 faced tough questioning from the chief prosecutor , however , about @entity0 ' alleged egotism and tantrums , high - speed driving and love of guns			1
the prosecution maintains that he intentionally killed @entity44 in his home after an argument in the early hours of february 14 , 2013			0

he also faces gun - related charges			0
the agent , who helped guide @entity0 to success as a globally renowned athlete with lucrative sponsorship deals that have since been stripped away , testified that his client had a ' heightened sense of awareness ' and appeared preoccupied with security at times			1
on one occasion , he recalled , @entity0 drove with him at high speed to the airport and , when told there was no rush , recalled a traumatic episode in which @entity129 was accosted at gunpoint while in his car in 2007			1
' he wanted to ensure that we are safe and not being followed , ' @entity129 said			0
he also remembered a time when @entity0 grabbed him by the arm in apparent fear when the pair heard a loud bang while walking in @entity174 , and described two occasions in which the runner lost his temper but was not aggressive under ' abusive questioning ' from journalists			2

prosecutor @entity72 tried to pick holes in @entity129 's testimony , pressing the agent for details about a reported incident in which a @entity198 athlete who was sharing a room with @entity0 asked for them to be separated because @entity0 was allegedly arguing frequently on his telephone			1
he also referred to a 2012 @entity15 race in which @entity0 accused the winner of breaking the rules by using prosthetic limbs that were too long			0
@entity206 acknowledged that it was the ' wrong place and wrong time for him to react in such a way ' but noted there was a ' long lead - up ' to the incident in which @entity0 had expressed concerns that rules were being flouted			2
@entity72 also described @entity0 ' plans to take @entity44 on trips as an example of alleged narcissism after @entity129 quoted the athlete as saying he wanted his girlfriend ' to see what my world is about , the pressure that i 'm under ' and ' how i need to perform			2
