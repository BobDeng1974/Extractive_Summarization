a discriminating side to babies has been revealed in a study that showed they condone bullying of those ' dissimilar ' to them			1
the @entity7 carried out research that found infants divide their friends from their foes as young as nine - months - old			2
previous research has shown that babies generally prefer people who act kindly , but this new study is the first to find that they condone antisocial behaviour directed at individuals who are different to them			1
@entity18 : babies are happy to condone bullying of people they feel are different or ' dissimilar ' to themselves , a new study has found professor @entity23 of the @entity7 's @entity24 , who carried out the study , said : ' our research shows that by nine months , babies are busy assessing their surroundings , trying to determine who is friend or foe			1
' one important way they make these distinctions , our study finds , is based on perceived differences and similarities			2
' researchers made babies choose which food they preferred between crackers and green beans then treated the babies to a puppet show			2
during the show one puppet demonstrated the same food preference as the infant , while another exhibited the opposite preference			0
in the experiments , other puppets harmed , helped or acted neutrally towards the puppets with different or similar food preferences			0
prompted to pick their favourite puppet , infants demonstrated a strong preference for the puppets who harmed the ' dissimilar ' puppet and helped the ' similar ' one			2
one baby even went as far as planting a kiss on the head of the familiar puppet			0
development : the behaviour is thought to be an early form of the social biases that most adults have professor @entity23 added : ' these findings suggest that babies feel something like schaudenfreude - pleasure when an individual they dislike or consider threatening experiences harm			1
' or babies have some early understanding of social alliances , recognising that the ' enemy of their enemy ' is their friend			1
' @entity23 described the behaviour as an early form of the social biases that exist in most adults			1
she said that as humans get older , they favour individuals who are more familiar to themselves - over people with whom they have fewer things in common			0
these familiarities include origins , languages , appearances - even birthdays and sports affiliations			0
while studies show that humans tend to gravitate toward people who have things in common , these preferences can have a dark side			0
professor @entity23 said : ' disliking people who are different may lead us to mistreat them , and excuse - or even applaud - others who mistreat people who are different than us			0
' but this does not mean that more extreme outcomes , like xenophobia and intergroup conflict , are inevitable			0
' rather , this research points to the importance of socialization practices that recognize just how basic these social biases might be and confront them head - on			1
' the study , called not like me = bad : infants @entity118 was published by the @entity119			0
researchers at the @entity7 , pictured , in @entity120 carried out the study on babies as young as nine - months - old			1
