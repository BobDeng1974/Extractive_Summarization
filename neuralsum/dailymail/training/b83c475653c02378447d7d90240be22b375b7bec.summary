by @entity1 reporter published : 21:11 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 21:17 est , 3 november 2013 an @entity3 man was faced with a nightmare of a hospital bill after slipping and hitting his head in his bathroom			1
@entity8 had just stepped out of the shower on @entity10 , and did n't wake up until almost two weeks later when he was faced with a $ 150,000 hospital bill			1
the 65 - year - old lawyer from @entity13 smacked his head on the bathroom floor and was taken to the @entity15 close to his house			2
nothing to drink to : @entity8 , 65 , was faced with a bill for $ 150,000 after spending two weeks in a hospital that was n't covered by his health insurance			1
his wife @entity21 , right , had been assured by hospital staff that all bills would be paid for he was diagnosed with a bleeding ulcer that led to anemia , which caused him to pass out			2
12 days after being admitted he was transferred to another hospital in the area before beginning a program of rehabilitation			2
not giving up : mr @entity8 tried to negotiate with his insurer , @entity30 , but was told he would have to settle his bill with the @entity15 directly the surprise bill came about because the @entity15 was not in his insurer ’s network			1
from the second he was in the ambulance to the emergency room and the intensive care unit , the clock was ticking and charges were racking up			2
‘ this is not anything anyone would want to go through			2
it might have been easier if you did not have insurance , ’ mr @entity8 said in an interview with @entity42 last week			1
‘ i do n’t remember @entity49			0
i was in the @entity50 for almost two weeks			0
’ his wife , @entity21 , was at his bedside throughout his recover and was told not to worry about the medical costs			0
professionals assured her that even though the hospital was out of network , they were protected under a federal law called the @entity58 and @entity57 ( @entity59 )			1
the law was passed in 1986 to prevent hospitals from refusing to treat patients without insurance , but it does n’t force insurers to cover costs , including when patients are admitted to hospitals without their consent or @entity69 mr @entity8 ’s insurer , @entity30 of @entity3 , paid for most of the bills and gave him reimbursement checks for $ 30,000 , he still faced a balance of $ 120,000 that he was told to settle directly with the @entity15			1
the clinic offered to reduce the bill by 20 per cent and organise a payment plan for him			1
it would have left him paying around $ 94,000			0
‘ when an individual comes to @entity15 in a medical emergency , @entity49 provides all the necessary care to stabilize and treat patients , regardless of their insurance status , ’ @entity49 spokeswoman @entity77 said in a statement			0
‘ a patient ’s health - benefit plan is determined by their insurance and may provide limited coverage for out - of - network care			0
@entity49 works with all patients to provide guidance and options regarding their insurance coverage			0
’ desert surprise : mr @entity8 was taken the the @entity49 because it was close to his house			1
he never considered that he would not be covered by his insurance company or the federal @entity59 law that covers emergency surgery mr @entity8 said that paying off the bill in full would be financially devastating and it left a bitter taste after paying premiums for years			1
a lawyer by trade , despite not knowing about @entity59 before going into hospital he looked into the law enough to know that he should have been covered			1
upon calling @entity30 to attempt to reason with the insurance company he said that it like talking to a brick wall with associates unable to explain what he was covered for under the plan			0
most of the representatives he spoke with also had no idea about the federal law or whether it even applied in his case			1
‘ seventy - five percent of the people i talked to did n’t know what @entity59 was , ’ he said			0
‘ the number of people i talked to who did n’t even know how to spell @entity59 was scary			0
’ @entity30 officials defended their so - called ignorance by pointing out the complex nature of health plans and the law surrounding them			2
they maintain that it would be impossible for every customer service operator to know about every possible scenario			0
‘ we understand these are difficult issues , ’ said @entity132 , senior vice president and general counsel of @entity30 of @entity3 to @entity42			0
‘ we go above and beyond to make sure our customers get what they expect from their plans			0
’ power of the press : it was only after local media got involved that the @entity15 decided to drop the charges however the hospital maintain hat such media pressure had nothing to do with it the newspaper and local @entity150 television station got in touch after one of mr @entity8 ’s children who works for the local television station put the case on the news			1
suddenly , the charges vanished and his $ 118,000 bill was erased			2
@entity30 officials would not discuss the negotiation process nor reveal how the charges were resolved			2
they would also not share the information with @entity8 , saying they do not discuss pricing , however they insist that it was nothing to do with the media ’s involvement			1
‘ just because patients get bills from a hospital does n’t mean that ’s what they should pay , @entity132 said			1
we did it on his behalf ... we negotiated so he would have no residual amount owed to @entity49			0
we view this as a very positive result			0
’ mr @entity8 is overjoyed by the outcome but he is now worried was would happen to other people who would not have the same access to the media as him			1
‘ ‘ what really troubles me , as someone familiar with this field , is what does the average person do ? ’ he pondered .			0

after *collapsing* in his bathroom , @entity8 was stuck with an *enormous* bill his insurer would n't pay
after negotiations , hospital agreed to reduce bill by 20 per cent
reveals *frustrations* of dealing with federal law that insurers knew little about
case was not fully resolved until local media got involved
