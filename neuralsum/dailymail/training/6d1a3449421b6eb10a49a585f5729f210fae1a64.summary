@entity0 has generated so much money from recreational pot taxes that the state is bound by law to pass some of the tax money directly on to residents			1
voters legalized marijuana in 2012 on the understanding that revenue raised would go to schools , but a 1992 voter - approved constitutional amendment means some of the $ 50 million gathered in taxes in the first year of legalized pot must be given to taxpayers as a rebate			1
the amendment requires @entity0 to pay back taxpayers when the state collects more than what 's permitted by a formula based on inflation and population growth			1
over the years , @entity0 has issued refunds six times , totaling more than $ 3.3 billion			2
@entity0 has generated so much money from recreational pot taxes that the state is bound by law to pass some of the tax money directly on to residents for once @entity30 and @entity31 are united and say there 's no good reason to put pot taxes back into people 's pockets , and now state officials are scrambling to figure out how to avoid doling out the money			1
it may have to be settled by asking @entity0 voters , for a third time , to cast a ballot on the issue and exempt pot taxes from the refund requirement			1
@entity30 concede that marijuana is throwing them off their usual position of wanting tax dollars returned to taxpayers			0
but they also tend to say that marijuana should pay for itself â€” that general taxes should n't pay for things like increased drug education and better training for police officers to identify stoned drivers			0
' i think it 's appropriate that we keep the money for marijuana that the voters said that we should , ' said @entity62 @entity63 president @entity62			0
his party opposes keeping other refunds based on the @entity66 but favors a special ballot question on pot taxes			2
' this is a little bit of a different animal			0
there 's a struggle on this one , ' said sen. @entity74 , one of the @entity30 budget writers			0
a 1992 voter - approved constitutional amendment means some of the $ 50 million gathered in taxes in the first year of legalized pot must be given to taxpayers as a rebate after legalizing marijuana in 2012 , @entity0 voters returned to the polls the following year and approved a 15 percent excise tax on pot for the schools and an additional 10 percent sales tax for lawmakers to spend			1
voters were told those taxes would generate about $ 70 million in the first year			2
the state now believes it will rake in about $ 50 million			1
but because the economy is improving and other tax collections are growing faster , @entity0 is obligated to give back much of what it has collected			0
final numbers are n't ready , but the governor 's budget writers predict the pot refunds could amount to $ 30.5 million , or about $ 7.63 per adult in @entity0			1
' it 's just absurd , ' said @entity31 state sen. @entity97 , one of the @entity99 's budget writers			2
the head - scratching extends to @entity0 's marijuana industry			2
several industry groups actively campaigned for the pot taxes but are n't taking a position on whether to refund them			0

lawmakers have a little time to figure out how to proceed			0
they 'll consider pot refunds and a separate refund to taxpayers of about $ 137 million after receiving final tax estimates that are due in march			2
when they talk about pot refunds , they 'll have to figure out if the money would go to all taxpayers , or just those who bought pot. previous refunds have generally been paid through income tax returns , but @entity0 also has reduced motor vehicle fees or even reduced sales taxes on trucks			1
lawmakers seem confident that the refund mechanism wo n't matter because voters would approve pot taxes a third time if asked			0
