by @entity0 rising prosperity among ethnic minority voters could help swing the election for @entity4 , a new report revealed yesterday			1
research by the left - leaning @entity8 think - tank suggests the emergence of a significant black and @entity11 middle class could break @entity13 ’s traditional stranglehold on the ethnic minority vote			1
the report , co-written by former @entity13 politician and equalities tsar @entity16 , suggests ‘ upwardly mobile ’ ethnic minority voters are more likely to vote @entity20			1
a report by think - tank @entity8 suggests ' upwardly mobile ' ethnic minority voters are more likely to vote @entity20 in the 2015 election - breaking @entity13 's traditional stranglehold it says @entity13 ’s hold over ethnic minority voters fades as they prosper and move to the suburbs			1
the authors say there is a huge electoral prize for the party that can get to grips with @entity36 ’s shifting demographics			0
the report states : ‘ there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that any emerging volatility among the @entity36 ’s five million ethnic electors may turn out to be at least as significant as the three million who tell pollsters they might support @entity45 in the forthcoming election			0
’ the study suggests that second - and third - generation immigrants are losing their ‘ reflex ’ support for @entity13 , particularly when they move to traditionally white middle - class areas			0
‘ the expectation would be that succeeding generations of minority voters may drift away from their parents ’ reflex support for @entity13 – or at the very least might not inherit the first - generation immigrants ’ hostility to the @entity20 , ’ it says			1
the @entity20 party secured only 16 per cent of the minority vote in the last election compared with 68 per cent for @entity13 ‘ the other factor that could boost the @entity20 share of seats is a secular out - movement of ethnic minority families from the inner - city neighbourhoods in which they first settled			1
‘ the process is accelerating in @entity71 in particular due to the combination of spiralling inner - city housing costs and changes to the benefit system			0
’ a study of polling data shows that while 60 per cent of ethnic minority voters in non-white areas support @entity13 , the proportion falls to 48.1 per cent among those living in traditionally white neighbourhoods			1
the effect is particularly marked among voters from an @entity86 background , with @entity13 support among this group falling from 39 per cent to 13 per cent when they move to white suburbs			0
mr @entity16 suggests the effect is significant enough to swing the result in a string of marginal seats			0
he suggests that the @entity94 are more likely to hang on to @entity13 target seats such as @entity96 and @entity97 because of the impact of ‘ upwardly mobile @entity86 heritage , @entity20 - voting electors ’			2
a study by the cross-party group @entity102 last year found the number of seats where black and @entity11 voters could decide the outcome had rocketed by 70 per cent compared with the 2010 election			0
it suggests that the ethnic minority vote is bigger than the majority of the sitting mp in 168 marginal seats			2
the seats extend beyond inner - city areas to include @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
in the last election the @entity94 secured only 16 per cent of the minority vote , compared with 68 per cent for @entity13 .			2

@entity13 's stranglehold on ethnic minority vote could slip due to emergence of black and @entity11 middle class , research shows
says ' upwardly mobile ' ethnic minority voters more likely to vote @entity20
