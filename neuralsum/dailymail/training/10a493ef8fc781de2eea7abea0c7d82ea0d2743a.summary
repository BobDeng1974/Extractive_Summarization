for professional sportsman , there is not much worse than the serious injury			2
it makes defeats and mistakes on the field of play seem as trivial as , in the wider context , they often are			2
what is often overlooked , however , is the daunting nature of the recovery period			2
the hours of lonely rehab , the moments when competitive action seems as far away as ever and – worst of all – the often unspoken fear that the body may never quite work in the same way again			2
there is only cure , of course , and that is time spent back in the arena , on the field of play , in combat			2
only time back in the thick of it clears the doubts from the mind and allows sporting instinct to return			2
on a cold night at @entity31 , @entity30 took an enormous step forward with a goal that will have finally helped him feel like a footballer again			1
while the other half , @entity100 's @entity61 , has been busy cementing his reputation in the @entity102 recently , @entity30 has been recovering from a cruciate knee injury suffered last march			1
the @entity105 's contribution this season had been 10 unremarkable minutes as a substitute in the home defeat by @entity108 on @entity109			0
@entity40 manager @entity110 , aware of the dangers associated with the specific injury , had been holding back a player who had started to strain at his leash			1
@entity30 was given another opportunity as his team trailed to @entity41 and , only 13 minutes after coming on , he watched a cross arrive from the right side and then simply let instinct take over , swivelling naturally to sweep the ball right - footed across goalkeeper @entity45 and in to the far corner of the goal			1
for @entity30 it was a landmark moment and it may well transpire to be so for @entity40 , too			1
for parts of this season so far , @entity110 's team have looked a little short of goal scoring threat and , despite the recent efforts of @entity60 , the sight of @entity130 and @entity61 back in harness can only brighten the mood in this part of @entity134			0
' when someone has waited that long to come back from a very serious injury , this is fantastic , ' said @entity110			0
' we are delighted to see him back			0
it 's very important we look after his recovery but this is a huge step on his journey			0
' for the neutrals , it was just good to have a story , something to talk about			0
for almost an hour , this was perhaps one of the worst games of football this stadium has ever witnessed			0
is it possible for nothing to happen in a whole half of professional football ? perhaps not			0
but certainly there was nothing of significance			0
no shots on target , no saves ( obviously ) and nothing that remotely resembled progressive intelligent football			0
@entity41 goalscorer @entity74 celebrates with @entity77 and @entity75 after opening the scoring @entity88 celebrates with his @entity41 team - mates after scoring the first goal of the match both managers had picked strong teams and deserve credit for that			1
not until the start of the second half , though , did either team begin to do justice to the decision to take the game , and the competition , seriously			2
it was @entity41 who showed first after the interval and their improvement owed something to the half - time introduction of their latest hero @entity77			1
the young striker ’s evening was to end badly but initially he was influential , his energy and direct running threatening to bring the best – if such a thing exists – out of the lumbering @entity80			0
@entity80 fluffed two chances before @entity41 took a lead they perhaps deserved through @entity74 in the 56th minute			1
@entity73 did well down the left side and when his cross found @entity74 in a yard or two of space , the @entity41 midfielder was able to take a touch before finishing powerfully and accurately from 12 yards			1
at that point , @entity40 had shown nothing to suggest they would get back in to the game and had @entity77 not seen a low shot rebound back from the knees of @entity40 ‘ keeper @entity51 shortly after @entity74 ’s goal then that probably would have been the end of the game			1
as it was , @entity40 sensed opportunity as the game drew on and @entity61 had already brought a save from @entity45 prior to @entity130 ’ equaliser			1
before the end @entity77 had an opportunity to add to his reputation but skewed his shot dreadfully across goal in added time			0
this time it was somebody else ’s night			0
@entity88 opens the scoring in the 56th minute with a left - footed strike past @entity40 goalkeeper @entity51 @entity51 dives to his right but he is unable to stop @entity74 's effort from hitting the back of the net the third round @entity38 encounter between @entity40 and @entity41 was played out in front of just 9,348 supporters @entity74 runs with the ball as @entity40 attacker @entity58 looks on in the background @entity41 's defenders look dejected as @entity40 striker @entity30 wheels away in celebration @entity40 celebrate in front of an empty stand after @entity130 levels the scoring in the 73rd minute @entity30 was making just his second appearance for the @entity40 since returning from a knee injury @entity80 shakes hands with @entity244 after being replaced by @entity245 @entity41 winger @entity245 runs down the wing after coming off the substitutes ' bench @entity77 removes grass from his boots during the second half of the third round @entity38 clash @entity40 boss @entity110 shakes hands with @entity41 's coaching staff while @entity244 looks disappointed @entity40 and @entity41 walk out on to the pitch ahead of the third round @entity38 match			1

@entity30 came off the substitutes ' bench to ensure @entity40 *remained* in the competition
@entity41 winger @entity74 scored opener in the 56th minute of clash at @entity31
winner of replay will face fellow @entity102 outfit @entity266 in @entity38 fourth round
