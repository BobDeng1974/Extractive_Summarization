@entity0 said today that if the @entity3 nationalists win the independence referendum they will not be able to keep their currency the pound is not an asset to be divided up ‘ as if it were a cd collection ’ and an independent @entity3 will not be allowed to share it , @entity0 insisted yesterday			1
the chancellor was backed by @entity11 and the @entity12 as he delivered a stunning blow to @entity15 ’s dream of persuading @entity3 to vote to break away from the @entity16			0
in a highly unusual move , the top civil servant at the @entity18 , sir @entity17 , agreed that sharing sterling with an independent @entity3 would be ‘ fraught with difficulty ’			2
he concluded : ‘ i would advise against entering a currency union with an independent @entity3			1
’ in a choreographed series of interventions designed to inflict maximum damage on the ‘ yes ’ campaign , @entity12 chief secretary to the treasury @entity27 and @entity11 ’s shadow chancellor @entity28 also insisted they would never agree to share the pound in a formal currency union			2
that would mean that if it wanted to continue to use sterling , an independent @entity3 would be reduced to the position of a country like @entity37 , which uses the @entity39 dollar but has absolutely no say over the management of the currency , or @entity42 , which uses the dollar and the euro			1
the warnings prompted a furious reaction from the @entity47 - who issued an extraordinary threat to default on their part of the national debt in retaliation if they win the independence referendum taking place on september 18			2
deputy first minister @entity57 said : ‘ the debt is legally the @entity18 ’s			0
@entity3 ca n’t default on debt that is not legally @entity3 ’s			2
’ she said the @entity60 wanted to keep the pound and enter into a formal ‘ currency union ’ with the remainder of the @entity16 - but said there were other options , including using sterling without a currency union or adopting a new currency for @entity3			1
@entity27 , @entity70 to the @entity18 ( left ) and shadow chancellor @entity28 ( right ) have both backed mr @entity0 's refusal to allow an independent @entity3 to keep the pound she insisted mr @entity0 was ‘ bluffing ’ and would moderate his position if @entity3 did back independence			1
but mr @entity0 insisted that while independence would expose @entity3 to bigger economic risks , a currency union would oblige taxpayers in the remainder of the @entity16 to bail them out if things went wrong			1
that prospect was ‘ patently absurd ’ , the chancellor said in a speech in @entity81			0
‘ if @entity3 walks away from the @entity16 , it walks away from the @entity16 pound			0
‘ the @entity60 says that if @entity3 becomes independent , there will be a currency union and @entity3 will share the pound			1
people need to know that is not going to happen			0
‘ because sharing the pound is not in the interests of either the people of @entity3 or the rest of the @entity16			0
’ a letter from sir @entity17 to mr @entity0 , released by the @entity18 , also dismissed the prospect of a currency union with an independent @entity3			1
it is almost unprecedented for such politically contentious advice from a senior civil servant to be released			0
however @entity57 ( right ) has hit back , suggesting that @entity0 is ' bluffing ' , and will change his mind sir @entity17 warned that @entity3 ’s banking sector is too big in relation to national income , and the @entity16 could end up having to bail the country out			1
he also told the chancellor that the @entity60 ’s threat to refuse a share of the @entity16 ’s debt is not credible			0
‘ currency unions between sovereign states are fraught with difficulty			0
they require extraordinary commitment , and a genuine desire to see closer union between the peoples involved , ’ the treasury permanent secretary said			0
‘ what worries me about the @entity118 ’s putative currency union is that it would take place against the background of a weakening union between the two countries , running counter to the direction of travel in the eurozone			2
‘ i would advise strongly against a currency union as currently advocated , if @entity3 were to vote for independence			2
’ mr @entity27 , the most senior @entity130 in the government , challenged mr @entity15 to a debate on @entity3 independence ‘ any time , any place anywhere ’ accusing the @entity136 leader of ‘ cowering in his bunker ’			0
mr @entity15 hit back , saying : ‘ this is a concerted bid by a @entity142 - led @entity141 establishment to bully and intimidate - but their efforts to claim ownership of sterling will backfire spectacularly in terms of reaction from the people of @entity3 , who know that the pound is as much theirs as it is @entity0 ’s			1

three main parties have united in saying independent @entity3 would not be able to use the pound in currency union
however deputy first minister has hit back , saying @entity0 is ' bluffing '
she added that @entity3 could default on national debt if union splits
