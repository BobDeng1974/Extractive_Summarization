a man suffered thousands of pounds of damage to his car after taking it in to the garage to have a lightbulb replaced			1
@entity6 took his @entity7 to a dealership 's workshop in @entity10 , @entity11 two weeks ago - but during the simple servicing a mechanic started driving it with its bonnet still up			1
the car crashed into a vehicle which had been elevated above the ground , causing the bonnet to bend back and smash into the windscreen and roof			1
smash : @entity6 's car was crushed by another vehicle when it was being driven around a garage smash : the windscreen was shattered in the bizarre accident at a @entity7 garage in @entity11 the father of two now says the garage has refused to restore the vehicle to its original state , and offered to pay just £ 4,000 to replace the car			1
mr @entity6 , 38 , said he was waiting outside the workshop when he heard a loud bang and saw the damage which had been done			1
' i could n't believe what i was seeing , ' he said			0
' i jumped out of my seat and looked out - i could see my car and there was a car on top of it			0
' there were people all over the place but they could n't give me a decent explanation of what had happened , they said it must have stalled or something			0
' the mechanic had driven it across the workshop with the bonnet up			1
it 's obviously common practice , and on this occasion he was caught out			0
' collision : the car 's bonnet was snapped off while the roof was dented , causing extensive damage shock : mr @entity6 only took his car in to get a lightbulb changed at a supposed cost of £ 40 mr @entity6 's car was left with its bonnet ripped off , a smashed windscreen and dents in the roof after the other vehicle seemingly fell from its ramp			1
the fire brigade had to be called in to remove the @entity77 from the bonnet of his car			2
mr @entity6 says he is worried that the vehicle could be unsafe to drive , and criticised the garage 's offer to buy it for £ 4,000 as that would leave him out of pocket when he buys a replacement			1
' they have offered to repair the car , but i 'm not interested , ' he said			0
' they want to do a cut and shove job , and take off the damaged parts and weld new ones back on			0
' i have got kids and i would not be comfortable driving my car with a welded roof			2
' they want to buy it from me for £ 4,000 , do the work and then put it on the forecourt and make a profit			0
i do n't think i should have to suffer any loss			0
' this has caused me and my family such huge anxiety and stress , simply because they 're not willing to put their hand in their pocket			0
' anger : mr @entity6 says he would refuse to accept the offer of repairs unless the car is restored to its original state dealership : bosses at the garage in @entity10 insist they are planning to repair the car fully mr @entity6 , a project manager from @entity119 , said he chose the dealership because he felt it would give him greater peace of mind despite its relatively high prices			1
he said he would have replaced the bulb himself if he had not been offered a free ' winter health check ' as a follow - up from his last servicing			0
he has now been provided with a courtesy car while his own vehicle is still damaged , and says he plans to keep it until the matter is resolved			2
a spokesman for the dealership said : ' i can confirm mr @entity6 's vehicle was involved in a minor collision during a routine repair in the workshop			1
we have apologised to mr @entity6 and accepted our responsibility			2
' we have given him the use of an @entity143 while we agree a proper remedy to this situation			0
the vehicle is easily repairable and we have offered to repair the vehicle at no cost			2
' we are sympathetic to mr @entity6 and continue to engage with him with a view to finding a mutually agreeable and reasonable solution			2

@entity6 , 38 , took @entity7 into garage to replace lightbulb
