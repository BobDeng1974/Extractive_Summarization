by @entity0 a teenager who developed a rare brain condition and forgot the first 16 years of her life following a seizure has been forced to piece her childhood together using family photos			1
when @entity7 , 19 , woke up in hospital every memory of her childhood were gone and she did n't even recognise two young brothers and mother			1
the teenager , from @entity13 , @entity14 , was 16 when she developed encephalitis , which causes inflammation of the brain			1
@entity7 , 19 , forgot the first 16 years of her life and did n't recognise her own mother after having a fit in a matter of hours she lost memories of every milestone from her childhood , and even forgot her favourite foods , bands and the fact she knew how to ride a horse			1
it has now taken her three years to piece her childhood memories back together , and she has relied on photographs , stories and childhood toys for help			1
@entity7 said : ‘ when i look back at pictures i can see i had an amazing childhood			1
i just wish i had memories to go with the pictures			2
’ with the support of her family , @entity7 can now recognise her mother @entity39 , 36 , and her brothers @entity40 , four , @entity42 , two , but she has lost her childhood friends , as she ca n’t remember any of them			1
@entity7 said : ‘ i ’ve lost all my childhood friends as i ca n’t recognise them or reminisce about old times and so it ’s hard to be around them as they knew the old me before the memory loss			1
‘ but for me , life is now about making new memories			0
i ’m having to start from the beginning			0
’ @entity7 developed encephalitis - swelling of the brain - which was caused by an infection , when she was 16 she had a fit and fell down some stairs so was rushed to hospital and when she woke up she could n't remember her childhood			1
she is now using pictures to help herself piece together her younger years @entity7 had been out for the day in with her boyfriend in august 2011 when she suddenly collapsed			1
she managed to get home and was put to bed , but had another seizure and fell down the stairs			1
medics were left baffled by the 16 - year - old ’s behaviour , as she had n’t shown any symptoms before			0
encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain			1
it usually begins with flu - like symptoms , such as a high temperature and a headache			0
more serious symptoms can then develop			0
these include confusion , disorientation , seizures and changes in personality			0
there are several different types of encephalitis that have different causes			0
the most common are caused by infections or an autoimmune reaction			0
the illness requires urgent treatment - usually in an intensive care unit and about 10 per cent of cases are fatal			2
some people make a full recovery but many experience permanent brain damage			0
this can cause complications such as memory loss , epilepsy , personality changes and fatigue			0
source : @entity104 @entity7 said : ‘ when i first came round , mum brought my two younger brothers to see me			1
i had no idea who they were and i panicked			0
‘ my mum had to introduce them to me			0
i found it really difficult , but they took it in their stride			0
‘ getting to know them again has been great though - @entity40 loves telling me tales about all the things we have done together that i ca n’t remember			2
the teenager had just finished her gcses and attended her school prom when she lost her memory - two events in her life she has no recollection of			2
but she is determined to stay positive and is training to be a hairdresser , despite still struggling with her short - term memory			1
@entity7 said : ‘ i have had to change every aspect of my life now because i do n’t know what i was like before			2
’ as a child @entity7 was a big fan of the band steps , and her mother took her to a @entity131 concert to try and jog her memory - but @entity7 could n’t remember any of her favourite songs			1
her encephalitis was caused by the herpes simplex virus - the same bug responsible for cold sores and chicken pox - but doctors were baffled as she showed no symptoms prior to suffering a seizure			2
normally , patients develop flu like symptoms before suffering a seizure			0
medics at @entity149 , @entity150 , were forced to sedate @entity7 because her seizure was so bad , but when she eventually came around her memories were gone			1
@entity7 ( pictured with her mother , @entity39 , and brothers , @entity42 and @entity40 ) still does n't remember her childhood @entity7 's mother , @entity39 , is trying to help her trigger memories that she has forgotten her mother said : ‘ @entity7 woke up and looked at me with a blank expression and said : “ who are you ? ” i was heartbroken and terrified			1
’ she added : ‘ i thought she would never remember me			2
‘ luckily after a few hours she began to recognise me and even asked for her favourite childhood teddy bear , @entity164 lamb , which is still the only thing she remembers			0
‘ i tried to surround her with family and things that she might remember but she did n’t even recognise her two younger brothers			2
‘ we even took her to a @entity131 concert , as they were her favourite band , but she could n’t recognise any of the songs			0
’ in an attempt to jog her memory , @entity7 has surrounded herself with old pictures , creating a wall of photographs in her bedroom			1
@entity7 ( pictured with her brothers ) also has short - term memory problems now @entity7 ( pictured as a baby ) now has to write herself detailed instructions of how to carry out everyday tasks as she is unable to remember how to do them she said : ‘ when i looked at the pictures i could see how happy i was at the time but it just draws a blank in my head as i ca n’t think of the actual event or how i was feeling at the time			1
‘ most people my age look back at high school as the best years of their life but i ca n’t do that , i can just look at the pictures and imagine what it must have been like			2
’ the teenager , who also now suffers with short term memory loss , has to write down instructions for her bus journey to work as well as reminders to help her complete everyday tasks			1
@entity7 said : ‘ i panic if i ’m late and i have had to call my mum sometimes because i forget to get off at my stop and ended up at the last stop with no idea where i am			2
‘ it ’s really stressful but as long as i have a routine i can handle it all			0
‘ hairdressing is great because it ’s repetitive and so i can keep practicing until i learn things and remember them			0
despite her memory problems , @entity7 is currently training to be a hair dresser			1
she is pictured in hospital with her baby brother who was born just a few weeks before she fell ill @entity7 ( pictured as a child ) says hairdressing suits her as it is repetitive so she is able to keep doing things until she remembers them her mother said : ‘ i try and encourage @entity7 to not rely on technology and just to get in the habit of repeating things until they are really clear for her			1
‘ we have a laugh about it and @entity7 just refers to herself as a little bit ditzy rather than someone with a memory problem			2
’ @entity236 , chief executive of the @entity238 , said 4,000 new cases of the condition are identified every year in the @entity241			0
she said : ‘ the causes include infection , and the immune system going rogue and attacking healthy tissue			0
‘ it is the herpes simplex that is most likely to attack the parts of the brain responsible for memory			0
‘ of those people who survive encephalitis - the mortality rate is 80 per cent without swift treatment - seven out of ten respond to the anti-viral drug @entity256 , ideally if it is given with 24 or 48 hours			0
‘ however , those whose memory has been attacked are unlikely to recover in that respect , although what sufferers can develop is better ways of coping with their condition			0

@entity7 , now 19 , collapsed after a day out with her boyfriend in 2011
was put to bed , but then had a seizure and was rushed to hospital
