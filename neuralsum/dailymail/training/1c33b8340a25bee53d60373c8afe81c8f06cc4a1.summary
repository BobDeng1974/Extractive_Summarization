a woman has spent the last 15 years of her life looking eight months pregnant due to a mystery bowel condition			1
@entity3 , 33 , says the disorder has left her with a severely bloated her stomach since she was 18			1
now , after thinking she would never find a cure , doctors have trialled her on a revolutionary machine which instantly relieved her symptoms			2
miss @entity3 , who has a five - year - old daughter , said : ' ever since i 've had this condition , i 've had a bloated stomach and it looks like i am eight months pregnant			1
' it has affected me all my life and means i ca n't go out and socialise with friends like a normal person			1
' but a pacemaker - like device , put into the bowel to regulate her movements , could hold the key to her recovery			1
the operation is known as a gastric electrical stimulation procedure			2
she said : ' when i had the trial they put it on the outside of my body with a tube leading down my throat			0
' it instantly made me feel better and for the first time , i felt normal			1
miss @entity3 said she can only find one other example of anyone else having the procedure			1
after searching on the internet , miss @entity3 said only one other similar diagnosis could be found - a patient living in @entity52			1
since the trial , she has been told she can have the operation to have the device fitted permanently - finally putting an end to her suffering			1
gastric electrical stimulation ( @entity58 ) uses a device implanted in the abdomen to send mild electrical pulses to the nerves and smooth muscle of the lower stomach			1
it is conventionally used to help patients with gastroparesis , a condition affecting the nerves and muscles of the stomach , delaying the emptying of food from the stomach into the small intestine			0
several different conditions can cause gastroparesis , including diabetes and nervous system disorders , although in many cases the cause is n't known			0
@entity58 is used to treat patients with gastroparesis but only in patients whose symptoms ca n't be controlled by medication			0
the pocket watch - sized device , called a neurostimulator is surgically implanted in the right side of the abdomen			1
but last week , days before the operation was due to take place , she was told it would not be going ahead as planned			0
she said : ' i was so excited to finally be getting the operation			0
it was a relief knowing there was finally a light at the end of the tunnel			0
' now i 've been left in limbo and i do n't know what is happening			0
' miss @entity3 was originally told her operation would be taking place at @entity105 , near @entity106 , on april 9			1
but last week , when she phoned to get a confirmation letter so her mother could get time off work to look after her daughter , miss @entity3 was told the operation had been cancelled			1
she tried phoning her own gp and her surgeon to find out what had happened			0
some medical professionals told her the operation had been cancelled , while others thought it would be taking place in @entity119			0
now , @entity121 @entity120 ( @entity122 ) , the body that funds operations for people living in the city , starting from april 1 , says it will fund the procedure , but can not confirm when or where it will take place			0
miss @entity3 said : ' i was arranging for someone to look after my daughter and i had started packing my bag ready for april 9			1
' i 'm relieved the @entity122 has said it is still being funded , and not cancelled , but i still do n't have a proper answer			0
' i was all set to go to @entity105 on april 9 , but now i 'm not sure what is going on			0
' a spokesman for @entity121 @entity122 said funding for miss @entity3 's treatment had been approved by its @entity139			2
waiting : she is now waiting for an operation date to have the revolutionary device fitted			2
it involves putting a pacemaker - like device into the bowel to regulate movements they also explained it would not be taking place at either @entity150 or @entity105 - the two bases run by @entity106 and @entity152			1
the spokesman said : ' the funding for miss @entity3 's treatment was approved by @entity154 and this funding remains in place			2
' the highly specialised nature of the gastric electrical stimulation procedure means that few centres in the country are accredited to undertake it			0
' @entity162 is not one of these accredited centres			0
' it is extremely regrettable that the communication with miss @entity3 did not make it clear that her procedure would need to be carried out with an accredited provider			2
" this is a matter we are urgently reviewing internally and in conjunction with @entity106 and @entity152			0
' in the meantime , we would encourage miss @entity3 to either contact her doctor or the @entity122 directly to discuss this matter further			2

@entity3 , 33 , says the disorder has made her severely bloated
she suffers from stabbing pains and is ' unable to lead a normal life '
has found *potential* cure in ' pacemaker ' that regulates bowel movements
is now desperately *hoping* to have operation to have the device implanted
