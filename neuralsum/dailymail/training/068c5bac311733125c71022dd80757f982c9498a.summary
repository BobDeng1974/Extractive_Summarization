a pensioner blinded in one eye after being struck by a cricket ball has regained his sight almost half a century after he lost it thanks to a routine check - up			1
@entity6 from @entity7 , near @entity8 in @entity9 , was 36 when he was hit above his left eye with a cricket ball while playing for village team @entity12 , in @entity14			1
he was told by doctors that the freak accident meant he would never see out of his eye again due to the pressure which had built up behind it			1
@entity6 , who has regained the sight in his left eye , 48 years after being struck in the head with the cricket ball mr @entity6 , 84 , continued to work and play sport throughout his life while coming to terms with the fact he would never see again out of his left eye			1
however decades later when a cataract began to grow on his healthy eye , surgeons assessed the damaged one and realised they could give the pensioner his sight back after 48 - years by relieving the pressure			1
his sight was restored after a three hour operation after he was sent to the @entity36 in @entity37 and operated on by dr @entity38			2
now aged 84 , mr @entity6 said : ' getting my sight back was incredible			1
' after the operation i came round and my sight was fine , and i could see things i could n't see before			2
' i still wake up in the morning and close my right eye to check if i can see out of my left			1
i feel like i have a new lease of life now and it 's marvellous			0
the pensioner had an operation to relieve the pressure behind his eye following a routine check up ' i was the first person she had done the operation on and when i went back to see her she told me she could do it on two or three others			1
' although the father - of - two can now boast of his clear vision for the first time since the accident , he said he had not longed for his sight to come back over the years and had to accept what had happened			1
' it was one of those things and i had to cope , ' he said			0
' i could n't see very well and i had to adapt to that			0
' i had my own cleaning business with ladies working for me , so it did n't affect work			0
' i continued to play cricket and was hit on the head a couple of times , but i was never as good as before the accident			2
' i do n't even remember this , but someone later told me i was on my knees on the ground and i said ' i am looking for my eye '			2
'' i had a cut across my left eyebrow and was taken to hospital for an x-ray			0
mr @entity6 was operate on by dr @entity38 at the @entity36 in @entity81 the doctors said at the time it was likely my eye would burst because of the pressure behind it			1
'' all i could see out of it was a grey light , and i had to just lie down and rest for nearly week			0
'' i was not really shocked when i was told i would n't be able to see out of it again			0
i think i realised that myself and i did get used to it very quickly , because what can you do ? '' there are people worse off than me so i did n't get sad or upset			0
i just ' thought ' well that 's it ' , there 's nothing you can do about it			0
' mr @entity6 's wife , @entity99 , 85 , said that because of his age she feared he might die during the operation , but was relieved when her husband came round			2
she said : ' i was thrilled with the result and could n't believe it			0
' it 's marvellous he 's got his sight back and he can now stand at the window and look at the hills to pick out things he has never seen before			0
