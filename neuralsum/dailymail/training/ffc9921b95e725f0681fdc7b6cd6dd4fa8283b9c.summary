vice president @entity0 came to the defense of embattled @entity3 chair @entity2 on friday in a speech at the organization 's annual women 's leadership forum			1
@entity0 told the predominately female audience that it 's ' great to work ' with the @entity11 congressman and that he 'd ' never seen anybody work as hard and as tirelessly ' as her			2
' and by the way , if we want anybody to do that 60 seconds or 120 seconds we get to respond to some attack on the president or the administration , the best person ... is always @entity2 , ' he said			1
@entity0 's full - throated support for @entity2 came a day and half after a @entity23 report claimed she was on the outs with the @entity25 - and the @entity26 - and may soon be asked to step down from her position in party leadership			1
the fiery federal lawmaker was never a lock to have a third term as chief spokesperson for the main branch of the national party , but her recent comparison of a @entity36 governor to a wife beater put her position in even greater jeopardy			2
vice president @entity0 , right , laughs as he is introduced by @entity3 chair @entity2 on friday at the @entity3 women 's leadership conference			1
@entity2 called @entity0 a ' national treasure ' and he described her are a tireless advocate for the party while speaking at a forum in support of @entity47 gubernatorial candidate @entity46 , a @entity48 , @entity2 claimed that incumbent @entity49 governor @entity49 ' has given women the back of his hand			1
' ' i know that is stark			0
i know that is direct			0
i know that is reality , ' she said			0
the @entity3 chair went on to claim that ' @entity36 @entity61 extremists ' like @entity49 ' are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back			1
' the female lawmaker 's claim was roundly criticized as inappropriate and insensitive to survivors of domestic violence , and the following day @entity2 issued an apology			2
while the outspoken @entity3 leader has made colorful remarks in the past about @entity36 ' opposition to policies her party says benefit women , @entity2 latest claim ruffled more feathers than usual and restarted an underground campaign to have her ousted as @entity3 chair			1
among the complaints lodged against the female party head in the article is that she 's more concerned with her own political ambitions than promoting the party			0
' we say the big " @entity91 " is for @entity3 , ' a @entity3 member of @entity88 is quoted as telling his colleagues in february during retreat			2
' for her , the big " @entity91 " is always for @entity2			2
' ' people know she works hard , ' another contemporary of @entity94 's is blindly quoted as having said			0
' but there ’s this sense that she only works hard for herself			0
' the article also claimed that president @entity98 and @entity2 have ' rarely ' spoken to each other since 2011 , either in person or over the phone			1
when the president has meetings with other party committee heads , he does not invite @entity2 , @entity103 's sources said			1
desperate for the president 's attention , @entity2 join photo lines at events featuring @entity98 in order to have his ear , if only for a few moments , @entity23 contended			1
in an official statement about @entity2 's tenure as @entity3 chair , deputy @entity25 spokesman @entity117 claimed that that @entity11 politician was doing ' a great job ' helping @entity3 candidates put their best foot forward in their upcoming elections			1
' the president is grateful for all of the hard work being done by the entire team at the @entity3			1
he fully recognizes the value of their work , and that ’s why he has worked so hard to support them , ' the @entity25 flack said			0
but behind the scenes , democrats are arguing that @entity2 should be replaced as the committee 's head at the conclusion of the current election cycle , @entity23 revealed			0
if the incidents relayed in @entity23 's article did in fact happen , @entity26 ' opinion of the @entity11 representative have shifted significantly since she was named head of the influential party committee in 2011			1
in announcing her promotion , @entity23 stated that she was ' beloved by the @entity3 rank and file for her aggressive , outspoken advocacy for liberal points of view			0
' the @entity3 chairwoman did not address her critics during today 's event , but in keeping with the theme of the conference , she made the case for putting women in charge of the @entity26 's outreach efforts			1
' the reason that you 're here , ' she told conference attendees , is ' because you know as well as i do that more often than not if you want to get something done , you send a woman to do it			0
' @entity2 notably cudgeled @entity36 candidates for not knowing how to talk to appropriately talk to women voters in her remarks , as well , and argued that female voters should elect democrats to office if they want lawmakers who reflect ' their values as women			2
' former secretary of state @entity179 , right , gets a hug from @entity2 before speaking at the women 's leadership forum			2
democrats had nothing but praise for @entity2 at today 's conference but a recent news report suggests it 's all for show the vice president , who made a few gaffes of his own in recent days , did n't weigh in on controversy plaguing @entity2 , however he went out of his way to talk her up as both a friend and a party leader			1
@entity0 teasingly compared his former colleague to his ' little sister , ' noting that when she needs him to do something , ' she does n't even ask , she just tells me where to go , what to do , ' before moving on the topic of his speech , which was , somewhat ironically , domestic violence and sexual assault			2
speaking about his early support for legislation that would make make violence against women illegal , @entity0 said he ' could n't understand why a woman , who twice a week her husband was home smashing her head against a wall , chocking her , would live in that circumstance for years			2
' @entity0 used the speaking gig to promote the @entity25 's new public awareness campaign about sexual assault on college campuses , it 's on @entity220			1
' there will always be some man raising his hand to someone weaker physically , whether a woman or a child , ' the vice president admitted			0
' but success will come when the societal attitude changes , and not a single woman in the world asks herself the question , what did i do ? ' never , never , never is it the woman 's fault , other than self - defense			0
never ! never ! ' @entity0 shouted amid uproarious clapping from the crowd			0
president @entity98 will also address the women 's leadership conference later this afternoon , and he will likely talk about the importance of electing women to the @entity245 , in addition to the @entity25 's efforts to decrease sexual assault on campus			1
touching on the upcoming elections this morning , @entity0 claimed the progress women have made will ' slide back a decade ' if @entity26 lose control of the @entity245 and do n't gain seats in the @entity25			1
' the president is a wonderful guy			0
he 's my great personal friend			0
but right now we feel like [ @entity257 ] at the bridge or little @entity260 men at the dyke , ' @entity0 said referring to two ancient fables about outnumbered men overcoming unthinkable obstacles			0
' i mean all we 're able to do right now is stop bad things from happening			0
that 's useful , but that 's not why we wanted the job , ' @entity0 continued			0
' we wanted the job to do things , and we 've done a lot through the president 's executive orders and the first two years when we had a @entity3 @entity25			1
so folks it 's time for us to step up and make our case without apology			0
' as the vice president took the stage to give his remarks , @entity2 lavished praise on him , saying , ' he is a treasure			2
' stating that she was neutral as the @entity3 chair ' and would be ' in 2016 , she told the audience she sported a @entity0 for president button on her backpack in 1988 during the @entity290 politician 's first run for president			1
' my @entity293 , i 'm getting old , ' @entity0 told attendees afterward , eliciting an outburst of laughter from the audience			0
gosh , almighty , ' he said .			0
