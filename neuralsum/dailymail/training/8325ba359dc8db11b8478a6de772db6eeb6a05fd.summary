' in the aftermath of the alleged rape in january 2010 , when a lawsuit was filed against the school , one vice principal claimed that the girl was responsible for herself when she went into the bathroom			2
another , according to the documents , said that they ' were n't sure whether she consented ' to the alleged assault			0
