by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 for @entity3 it must have seemed like deja vu as @entity5 spilled the ball into his own net during @entity10 's @entity9 opener against @entity11			1
what seemed like a fairly tepid 25 - yard effort from @entity14 turned into an absolute disaster as @entity5 let it slip through his hands to see his side go 1 - 0 behind			1
memories for @entity3 must have immediately turned to one thing - @entity20			0
then , goalkeeper @entity20 , surprisingly selected ahead of the experienced @entity42 , had an absolutely shocker , letting a routine 20 - yard effort from @entity45 slip through his fingers in the 40th minute			0
@entity38 drew , @entity46 was dropped and their campaign never recovered			0
this time round for the @entity51 manager it was slightly different , the horror slip put them 1 - 0 behind , before @entity54 rescued a point with 15 minutes to go			2
capello , though , will be bemoaning his luck , and wondering how the same stuff can happen to the same guy twice			0
shocker : @entity46 spills the ball during @entity38 's opening game of the 2010 @entity9 bad : the error cost @entity38 two points during their game with the @entity41			1

@entity5 lets the ball slip through hands during @entity10 's @entity9 opener
moment *reminiscent* of @entity46 's *fumble* during 2010 @entity9
@entity3 in charge of teams *whilst* both mistakes were made
@entity10 pull one back to draw game 1 - 1 with @entity11
