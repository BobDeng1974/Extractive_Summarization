by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 05:21 est , 27 june 2012 a devastated @entity2 class have received a grovelling apology from their headteacher after they were wrongly told they could take a copy of a text into an exam			1
horrified teachers only realised their mistake when the exam board contacted them to say it was in fact a closed book exam – and all results would be cancelled			1
the @entity18 students from @entity19 in @entity20 sat through the entire @entity23 @entity22 exam earlier this month , believing they could refer to their copy of @entity25 close by @entity27 writer @entity26			1
headteacher @entity28 , delivered the blow to the students and their parents yesterday and said the school was ' mortified ' , putting it down to a ' really bad mistake '			1
blundering teachers allowed students to take a text into the exam which meant they were disqualified			1
library picture but exam board @entity23 insists the guidelines were clear and it had no choice but to disqualify all the participants			1
mr @entity28 said : ‘ it was a bad mistake and i have personally apologised to the students affected by it and also to their parents			1
‘ the school , very unusually , made a mistake and it is a terrible mistake on exam entries			2
‘ but one thing to understand - and i will keep apologising to school pupils and parents - as it happens it will not disadvantage any of those students in their future			2
‘ that is a bit of good news			0
’ students were told they were allowed to refer to their copy of @entity25 close by @entity26 during their @entity2 exam the pupils had taken gcse @entity2 at the end of @entity64 ahead of their peers as they excelled in the subject			1
the top - set pupils were given the chance to take their as - level @entity2 language and literature exam early			2
they had sat @entity71 of the exam separately , and will be able to keep those results			2
in a letter sent out to parents , mr @entity28 , said : ‘ i am very sorry to report that a serious mistake was made by the @entity2 department and the students were led to believe they were allowed to take their texts into the exam			1
‘ this was not the case and as a result @entity23 took the decision to disqualify all candidates who were entered for @entity86			0
‘ this means the students will be awarded a grade for their unit 1 examination , which is unaffected by this , but their unit 2 result will be cancelled			2
‘ this will not be recorded as a " fail " but will be classed as a " non-entry " and will mean the students have completed 50 per cent of this as course			0
’ he also told parents that students who sat the exam and return to the school in september will be given the opportunity to complete the course in january with the help of extra lessons			1
the school has now launched an investigation into how the mistake happened			0
mr @entity28 said : ‘ it was still a mistake that was made by the school and we are mortified to have made that mistake and will make sure it will never happen again			0
‘ it is a really bad mistake			0
’ parents , who are being invited to meetings at the school to discuss the issue , reacted with shock and anger when they found out			0
a spokesman for @entity23 said : ‘ the guidance we provide to schools and colleges is very clear , so issues like this are quite rare			0
‘ however , if situations like this arise we need to be fair to all students taking our exams			0
‘ we therefore , unfortunately , have no option but to take this action , but we do so knowing that they have further opportunities to sit this unit			0
