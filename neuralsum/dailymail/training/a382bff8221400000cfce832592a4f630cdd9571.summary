the owners of the @entity2 building used as @entity4 's apartment for the filming of @entity6 are outraged after @entity7 staged a photo shoot on their stoop without allegedly asking for permission			1
a constant stream of @entity6 fans have led the owners of the @entity15 building to install a metal chain across the steps that reads ' do not go on staircase please '			1
while some wannabe carries have crossed the chain before to take personal pictures at the tv mecca , the homeowners were shocked @entity7 herself would violate their privacy			1
