reaction : @entity1 became ' very giddy ' a frankenstein food breakfast cereal designed for children and packed with additives linked to bad behaviour and hyperactivity is being sold in @entity7			1
@entity8 , which is imported from the @entity9 , is the first mainstream @entity11 food to go on sale in this country			1
the cereal , which is being sold by @entity15 , is at the vanguard of what @entity11 advocates hope will be numerous products to arrive in kitchens here			2
its use of genetically modified corn is buried in small print on the package			2
@entity11 corn has been eaten in the @entity9 for more than a decade			2
however , critics of the technology argue that not enough research has been carried out to ensure these foods are safe			2
most @entity11 corn plants have been modified in the laboratory to contain a toxin that kills pests that feed on them			2
potentially more alarming is the fact that the cereal contains a number of artificial colours that the @entity40 urges manufacturers not to use because research found a possible association with hyperactivity in young children			1
@entity8 is marketed as a nutritious cereal for children , but contains four suspect colourings – @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
@entity15 bans the use of @entity11 ingredients from its own - label foods , including breakfast cereals , on the basis that @entity7 families have rejected the technology			0
however , this ban does not apply to other brands and the store has also lifted its ban on the use of @entity11 animal feed at farms that supply meat , milk and eggs			0
@entity68 , which makes @entity8 , points to its wholegrain content and describes the mix of corn , soya , sugar and marshmallow as ‘ magically delicious ’			1
however , one father said @entity15 was ‘ letting customers down ’ by selling it			0
@entity78 , a psychotherapist from @entity79 , south - west @entity80 , said his nine - year - old son @entity81 became ‘ very giddy ’ , talked incessantly and was extremely hyperactive after eating the cereal , which @entity15 is selling at a premium price of £ 5 a box			0
‘ as his behaviour became more and more unusually hyper and lacking attention i then noticed that he was enthusiastically eating and talking about this new cereal called @entity8 , ’ said mr @entity78			1
‘ i checked the box and found out that in very small lettering it said that it was a @entity11 food			0
small print : @entity15 says that @entity8 adhere to the ' relevant legislation ' even if it may have adverse effects ‘ i destroyed the packet and he calmed down the next day but i was very concerned and angry			1
’ it seems likely that the adverse reaction was caused by the suspect colours			1
there is a smallprint warning on the pack that the cereal may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children			1
mr @entity78 said the cereal was on prominent display at the local @entity15 and is sold in a packet that is ‘ extremely attractive to little kids ’			0
@entity112 , of campaign group @entity111 , called on customers to boycott @entity15			0
‘ the idea of promoting a cereal to children that is not only @entity11 but also contains suspect colours does not seem to me to be the correct policy for a company that claims to be a responsible retailer , ’ he said			1
@entity68 said it does not supply the cereal to @entity7 stores and that @entity15 had ordered its supplies from a third party importer			0
the supermarket said in a statement : ‘ we sell this branded product as part of our world foods range			0
the product ingredients are clearly labelled and are in line with relevant legislation			0

imported @entity8 can have adverse effects on children *'s* behaviour
it is marketed as nutritious , but contains four suspect colourings
