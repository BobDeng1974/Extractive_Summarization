you could almost see the collective wince in the away end at @entity3			2
the calf injury sustained by @entity5 in midweek presented a problem much bigger than @entity7 merely missing their leader - it brought @entity9 and @entity10 together			1
these are two central defenders with genuine ability , but for whatever reason continue to turn in disastrous performances and undermine the @entity17 champions ’ credibility			2
@entity19 of @entity20 is challenged by @entity9 ( right ) during the match at @entity3 striker @entity22 of @entity20 battles with @entity10 ( right ) for the ball they had never played a league fixture alongside each other before saturday evening - and it showed			1
this was as bad as it could possibly get - a shambles from start to finish			1
two men who did n’t talk to each other , engulfed with the jitters			2
memories of the difficulties endured against @entity37 in the @entity38 are still fresh			0
the really startling fact is that these chasings have n’t come against a team with the quality of a @entity43 - they find themselves in a mess when met with sides who will finish the season in the bottom half			1
@entity5 himself - who watched on solemnly alongside @entity51 - has been nowhere near his commanding best this season , but his absence shows just why @entity54 wo n’t be lifting the title come may			1
@entity9 ' defensive statistics during the 2 - 2 draw at @entity20 via @entity58 @entity7 defender @entity9 ' own goal during the second half at @entity3 via @entity58 @entity62 's defensive statistics during the 2 - 2 at @entity20 via @entity58 they need to admit their mistakes in the transfer market and go out in january to sign a partner for @entity68 - one who can slot in immediately and rid us of this ludicrous facade			1
the way in which @entity10 was pulled apart by the combination of @entity22 and @entity74 makes the £ 32million paid to @entity75 in the summer a laughable amount			0
@entity62 ’s only bit of positive defending was a last - ditch tackle to clear as @entity79 raced through			2
even then he had been caught the wrong side in the direct place			0
writing 23 - year - old @entity62 off already - three months into his career in @entity85 football - would be wrong , but they can not go on with him in this frame of mind			2
with each passing week he gets worse , he looks increasingly nervous and makes more mistakes			0
it took just eight minutes for the two to be guilty of ball - watching as the offside @entity74 headed beyond @entity94			2
@entity7 did have a high line which caught the striker out , but neither had tracked him			1
neither had a clue where he was			0
and they did exactly the same moments later when @entity74 was free , 12 yards out , but thwarted brilliantly by the goalkeeper			0
that particular inquest went as far as a a shrug			0
time and again a @entity20 man go in between them			1
@entity9 put past his own goalkeeper @entity94 with a dismally - timed header in the second half @entity9 stands defeated as the @entity20 players celebrate going 2 - 1 in front @entity7 were shaken			1
there was no confidence emanating from @entity94 - who found himself in all sorts of trouble			2
@entity5 is the man to rally in that situation , but @entity62 and @entity9 shrank , with hands on hips , gormless expressions and puzzled eyes			1
the @entity120 was absent without leave when @entity74 finally got his goal ; it was difficult to miss the former @entity125 frontman running between the centre - halves , but @entity9 stood and watched with a hand up			1
not offside , and not clever			0
he looked lost , not a man who has starred in a @entity131 final			0
it ’s a worrying trait and does beg the question as to the whereabouts of @entity135 , who has n’t featured in the @entity17 since january			0
the @entity136 is 21 but showed he is infinitely more consistent than those ahead of him			0
@entity54 clearly does n’t fancy him , but may have to re-think that assessment sharpish			0
or just hope @entity5 is back fit and firing after the international break			1
because my word , do they need him			0
@entity9 ended up putting through his own net			1
somehow , it felt oh so fitting .			0

@entity9 and @entity151 struggle in 2 - 2 draw at @entity20
@entity155 game that the defensive *duo* have started together
@entity159 scores a poor own goal in the second half
@entity7 without @entity5 through midweek injury
