by @entity0 @entity2 midfielder @entity1 has delivered a withering put - down to @entity4 by insisting @entity6 minnows @entity5 gave his team a tougher test			1
@entity10 ’s side require an extraordinary fightback at @entity12 this evening after losing 4 - 1 in last week ’s first leg in the @entity15 capital			1
that was in stark contrast to @entity2 ’s previous home game in the @entity20 qualifiers , when @entity21 ’s emerged with a goalless draw before being hammered 5 - 0 in @entity23			1
slammed : @entity1 says @entity6 side @entity5 gave @entity2 a tougher test than @entity4 @entity25 youngster @entity1 claims he is not complacent about the return game with @entity4 , but admitted he has already selected an ideal opponent for the play - off round			1
‘ @entity5 ’s player a lot tougher against us than @entity4 , ’ he said			1
‘ they gave us a very tough game in @entity34			1
‘ with @entity4 , we did n’t know what to expect , but we were expected to easily beat the @entity6 side , which we did , but only after a big fright and a good performance away			1
fortunately , we regained our composure and we are now on the right track			2
‘ of course , we have n’t qualified past @entity4 yet , but we have talked about the opponents in the next round			1
‘ personally , i would like to get @entity44 - i think we would have a really good chance against them			2
’ the impact of holding the @entity49 opening ceremony means @entity50 remains out of commission			2
that could be viewed as an advantage for @entity2 but @entity1 is cautious about the visit to @entity55			1
cocky ? the midfielder admits he is already thinking of their next round opponents ‘ we respect our opponents , ’ he insisted			2
‘ @entity4 are a great club			1
they will have good support from their fans			0
but we have a big advantage from the first leg , so i am very confident			2
‘ we wo n’t approach the game thinking we have already won it - that kind of attitude would see us lose it			2
but we have united as a team after last wednesday and we want to look forward			0
i did not think it was my best game personally but the whole team rose to the challenge			0
‘ the @entity20 is the most important competition to us now and it would be fantastic to get to the group stage			1
’ the brutal truth for @entity4 is that they could be facing an even greater deficit			1
@entity2 ’s @entity78 failed to convert two penalties in the first leg			2
‘ i went to @entity80 for the second one and i said that i could take it , ’ recalled @entity1			1
‘ i felt strong and i wanted to try			0
‘ he decided to take it again and , frankly , i do not blame him			0
he is very strong mentally and sometimes these situations happen			0
@entity86 played a great match and that ’s what counts			0
‘ if we win a penalty in the second match , i think it will be taken again by @entity86			0
’ disappointing : @entity4 were embarrassed in the first leg , losing 4 - 1 away from home meanwhile , @entity2 manager @entity93 has defended the celebrations of his players at the end of the first leg			1
injured @entity4 captain @entity97 has insisted his colleagues will draw motivation from the goading way the @entity15 side greeted their 4 - 1 victory			1
@entity93 , though , believes there was no intention by his charges to go over-the - top and create an impression of job done			2
‘ it was just happiness , ’ he insisted			0
‘ i think our players were just so happy to play a good game and score good goals			0
i think that ’s what they were celebrating			0
‘ it was a big win for us against a big team and that brought joy			0
but it was n’t celebrating because they think the tie is over			0
we still have another big game to come			0
we know we have to play well and do our job 100 per cent			0
we also expect @entity4 to do better			1
‘ nothing is decided yet			0
as i said , i think players were just happy with what they did last week			0
‘ before this tie started , @entity4 were big , big favourites			1
it is difficult to say who the favourites are now			0
’ sloppy : @entity131 was sent off in the match the former @entity134 centre - back also played down the impact of @entity4 being displaced from their home			1
‘ of course , the atmosphere at @entity138 is huge , ’ added @entity93			0
‘ it is the same at @entity140			0
‘ but if the @entity4 fans fill this stadium then there will be a huge atmosphere here , as well			1
‘ it ’s still in @entity146 in front of their supporters			0
i ’m sure @entity4 will treat it as a home game , as they did in the last round against @entity154			2
‘ this is a good test for us			2
we do n’t have the @entity20 experience that @entity4 have			1
we want to get to their level so this a good chance to test ourselves against a team that has played in @entity163 for many years			2

@entity1 says @entity165 gave them tougher test than @entity4 in @entity34
@entity170 champions fell to 4 - 1 defeat in @entity20 qualifier ( first leg )
@entity97 has promised to give his all for @entity4
