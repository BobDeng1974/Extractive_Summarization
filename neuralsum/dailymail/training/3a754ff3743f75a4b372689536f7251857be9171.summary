by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 19:04 est , 15 november 2012 down through the generations , there has always been a special place for the gals from one particular family tree			2
first there was grandmama , supremely elegant in an off - the - shoulder dress and full - length pearl necklace			2
then came mother , hand in loving hand with the man she was betrothed to marry			0
@entity14 would make an appearance a little while afterwards			0
a sophisticated ' girl in pearls ' ... miss @entity18 , from @entity19 , has continued a long family tradition by being the cover girl of @entity22 ... who also likes to kiss the girls and hug her beau , as seen on @entity26 @entity18 exchanges a kiss with another girl in a photo unlikely to grace the pages of @entity22 the 21 - year - old pulls silly faces with a male friend on her social networking site page a kiss for @entity36 , the cardboard cut - out variety so perhaps there was a certain inevitability that one day , just like her forebears and relatives , 21 - year - old miss @entity18 would also grace the most famous single page in publishing – the frontispiece of @entity22			1
how perfect she looks , blue eyes sparkling brightly , furry collar against the autumn chill , sunlight bathing a flawless complexion			0
but peek behind the affectionately named ‘ @entity53 ’ slot of the 115 - year - old magazine , and – golly gosh – how times have changed			0
left : @entity18 's grandmother , @entity56 , later @entity57 , began the family tradition back in 1956			1
the @entity61 and fiance @entity60 - @entity18 's parents - in a @entity22 from 1985 for despite the magazine ’s boast that its frontispiece has become ‘ a matchless pictorial social history ’ , an equally celebrated social chronicle – @entity26 – tells a rather different story through @entity18 ’s own page			1
and it ’s more than just the pearls that have moved with the times			0
it shows her hugging her boyfriend ... looking a little perky with a drink or cigarette in her hand ... having fun on holiday ... and clearly enjoying college life with her companions – both male and female			1
in other words , a thoroughly modern portrait of a 21st century gal. in the current edition of @entity22 , @entity18 admits to feeling ‘ a certain amount of pressure ’ to appear as a girl in pearls , albeit only with pearl earrings , but also calls it ‘ a real honour ’			2
@entity18 's aunt , miss @entity95 , posed for the magazine in 1998 in 1985 her mother , the @entity98 , was pictured beside her fiance @entity60 , later to become @entity18 ’s father , on their engagement that november			1
thirteen years later her aunt , @entity95 , would grace the page too			2
but it was @entity18 ’s grandmother , then miss @entity107 , who started the tradition in 1956 on her engagement to captain the @entity111 , later @entity112 , son of the former marshal of the @entity114			1
an @entity116 backbencher and @entity117 and @entity118 educated chairman of the @entity120 , lord @entity61 was the brains behind @entity122 , the @entity123 , with a vision for a blue - blooded ‘ think - tank ’ of hereditary peers expelled from the @entity127			0
@entity18 , from @entity128 , @entity19 , studied for an executive @entity130 diploma at @entity131 and @entity132			2
in an article accompanying her @entity136 debut , the magazine explains : ‘ as the status of @entity22 woman changed , we began to divulge more about their lives : their ages , schools , universities , engagements and careers ... ’ still a little less , perhaps , than @entity18 divulges on her publicly accessible @entity26 page			1
we learn that she is ‘ in a relationship ’ , and can see a picture of the lucky chap , a young beau called @entity153			0
her ‘ likes ’ include an @entity155 nightclub			0
meanwhile in @entity22 , @entity157 says : ‘ it ’s really lovely that generations of the same family , years apart , can appear on the same page , marking similar stages in their lives			1
if only they ’d had @entity26 in @entity164 ’s day .			0

miss @entity18 , 21 , follows in a family tradition of @entity22 cover girls
elegant grandmother , then miss @entity107 , was first
in 1985 , @entity18 's mother , the @entity98 graced cover - followed 13 years later by @entity172
all very refined ... but @entity18 's social networking page shows her pulling silly faces , hugging a male friend and kissing girls
