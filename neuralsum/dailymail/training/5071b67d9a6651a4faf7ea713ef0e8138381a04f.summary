@entity0 took to his new @entity2 no 10 jersey like a duck to water - but it was @entity8 flyer @entity6 who made the biggest splash at @entity10			1
@entity0 , the 24 - year - old fly - half so desperate to stay in the @entity13 mix for the @entity14 after getting that unexpected chance to shine in the summer tour to @entity17 , kicked 16 points and showed great control and composure on his bow			1
he looks to be the ideal replacement for @entity23 , who gave up the chance of more @entity13 caps to play for @entity26 in @entity27			1
hat - trick : @entity6 enjoyed an excellent performance , scoring a 17 - minute hat - trick tackle : @entity32 is taken down by @entity0 during their @entity34 opener power : @entity36 is tackled by @entity39 pair @entity37 and @entity40 as @entity2 won easily @entity0 dictated the game as @entity2 made a commanding winning start to the campaign			1
and they did so courtesy of wing @entity6 ’s three fine tries that left director of rugby @entity47 crowing : ‘ @entity49 is a fantastic finisher			2
he took his chances superbly and he ’s happy because his parents were here			0
they have never watched him play outside @entity8			0
so they picked a good game ! as for @entity0 he looked sharp and will give us that special edge			2
. ‘ it ’s the perfect way to start the season with five points because this was a potential banana skin			2
we should be in the mix again fighting for the title			0
’ tigers were without @entity13 and @entity62 forward @entity63 who pulled out just before kick - off with a shoulder problem			0
contract : @entity6 had looked likely to leave in the summer but @entity2 persuaded him to stay consolation : @entity37 scores @entity39 's first try , but the northerners were always playing catch - up @entity0 kicked four first - half penalties to a single effort from @entity74 no 10 @entity75 and led 12 - 3 at the break			1
but @entity39 swept over the line within seconds of the restart			0
@entity79 weaved through and off - loaded for @entity37 to run over			0
@entity80 then shrugged off two tacklers and off - loaded			0
the ball struck a @entity39 player on the head and bounced for @entity6 to touch down			1
referee @entity85 awarded the try after several replays			0
the @entity8 finished off another move from the @entity2 forwards to grab his second try as @entity39 wilted			1
the hat - trick came when @entity6 ran almost the full length of the field after intercepting a pass			1
replacement scrum - half @entity95 went over for the fourth and bonus try before forward @entity98 replied with a late converted consolation try .			2
