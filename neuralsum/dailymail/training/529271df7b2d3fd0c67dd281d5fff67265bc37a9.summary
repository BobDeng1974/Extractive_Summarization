by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:51 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 14 february 2013 @entity2 claimed he had no knowledge of the scam which involved @entity6 brides and forged documents , but was convicted after a trial a law firm made £ 20million in @entity11 ’s biggest sham marriage racket which let up to 2,000 illegal immigrants stay in the country			1
solicitor @entity2 , 39 , and three colleagues flew women in from eastern @entity6 countries within the @entity17 to marry @entity19 citizens			1
most couples met on the day of the wedding and needed an interpreter to translate their vows			1
some of the grooms were @entity27 career criminals suspected of murder , drugs trafficking and money laundering			1
the criminals would pay the law firm around £ 14,000 to arrange marriages			2
often they would use fake identity documents to evade police at home			2
@entity2 and his colleagues @entity38 , 41 , @entity39 , 29 and @entity40 , 38 , made up ‘ love stories ’ to fool officials			1
last night a source told the @entity44 the ruse allowed ‘ dangerous criminals to operate ’ in @entity11			1
‘ we believe this to be the largest marriage fraud ever committed in the @entity11 , ’ the source said			1
the scam was run between january 2004 and february 2012			1
several brides were flown in each day and taken to registry offices across the country			1
they were paid off and told never to contact the ‘ husbands ’ again			2
at the @entity57 yesterday @entity2 and @entity56 were found guilty of receiving proceeds of crime and @entity39 guilty of money laundering			2
@entity2 claimed he had no knowledge of the scam , while immigration adviser @entity56 , 41 , tried to blame workmate @entity39 , 29 , but was also found guilty			1
@entity39 , who went on the run before the case got underway , was convicted in his absence			2
@entity40 had earlier pleaded guilty to his role in the illegal plan			2
@entity2 and @entity40 ( right ) were discovered to be part of a racket that created ' sham marriages ' in order to obtain @entity11 passports all three were found guilty of conspiracy to breach immigration law			1
as the verdicts were announced a woman sobbed so loudly in the public gallery that judge @entity79 had her removed from the court			2
@entity81 blew kisses to supporters from the dock as he was found guilty			2
the gang ran their empire from the offices of @entity2 's @entity89 law firm in @entity90			2
at one point they were flying in several brides a day on budget airlines including @entity95 and @entity96			1
@entity56 tried to blame workmate @entity39 for the crime the women would be housed in an @entity100 tower block before being taken to registry offices across the country			0
once married , their @entity19 husbands would have the right to live in the @entity11 and claim benefits because of their new status - and would usually be allowed to remain in the country if they separated			1
' that is the point of a sham marriage , ' said prosecutor @entity110			1
' that ’s why it is a business , because people want to come and live and work in this country			0
' normally if one was coming from a @entity19 country there would be complicated and difficult steps one would have to go through in order to be able to live and work in this country			0
' generally , people ca n’t do that			0
we do n’t have open borders in this country , except so far as @entity17 countries are concerned			0
' so in many cases these people who engage in sham marriages would have no chance at all of passing through the immigration system , either because they do n’t have the right skills or the right income			0
' forged affidavits containing details of the couples ’ supposed courtships were also included			0
in one , @entity27 @entity135 described how he met his @entity137 bride - to - be @entity136 while on a day out with friends in 2008			0
the affidavit said : ' we went to a cafe where our friends left us alone to get on with it			0
' @entity136 was a bit shy but i eventually persuaded her to let me take her out			0
' we did n’t go to any of the usual @entity137 or @entity27 places in north @entity100 but instead went to a really nice place in the @entity147			0
' after three months i realised i wanted to be with her all the time and asked her to marry me			0
’ another client recalled how he met his bride in a nightclub and proposed after a romantic @entity155 meal			0
the were scripted by the lawyers , with some couples only coming face to face at the registry office on the day they were married			0
the racket was busted when suspicions were raised about the number of couples marrying at @entity163 , despite having no links to the city			1
police raided @entity168 ’s offices and a lock - up rented by @entity39 , which contained thousands of files about the couplings			1
they had so many clients they ran out of bogus addresses and listed several couples as living in the same home			0
many applicants also claimed to work at a takeaway store called @entity181			0
the enterprise proved lucrative , with bank records showing thousands of pounds being paid into personal accounts belonging to @entity38 and @entity40			1
@entity2 studied immigration law since the age of 15 and specialised in the @entity187 , which allows @entity190 citizens limited rights to live and work in the @entity11			1
he was raking in a salary of nearly £ 50,000 after tax from legitimate work , the vast majority of which involved clients of @entity190 origin			0
the gang will be sentenced on monday .			0
