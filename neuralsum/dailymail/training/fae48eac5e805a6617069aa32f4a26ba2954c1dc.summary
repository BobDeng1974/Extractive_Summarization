' patronising ' : @entity0 as dr who in the 1980s worked with @entity2 on a specially written scene former dr who @entity0 claims @entity2 behaved like an overindulged child who lacked professional respect			1
@entity0 , 69 , worked with @entity2 on a specially written dr who scene which aired on @entity10 ’ll fix it in 1985			1
the scene had been set up after young boy @entity13 wrote to @entity2 asking if he could help him meet dr who and travel in the @entity17 , the doctor ’s famous time machine			1
@entity0 , who played the doctor from 1984 to 1986 , said : ‘ i met @entity2 briefly in the 1980s when i was working on dr who			1
a young man had written asking if he could “ fix it ” for him to meet the doctor and travel in the @entity17			2
‘ after the lad had saved the day and the @entity30 had been “ fixed ” , @entity2 entered the set and did his usual self - congratulatory shtick			1
‘ i did n’t warm to him			0
his demeanour was neither friendly , nor inclusive			0
he behaved much as one might expect a child to behave who had been indulged and led to believe that life revolved around them			0
‘ there was certainly none of the professional respect that one would expect to be shared when two programmes combine for a special purpose			0
even though we were on the @entity17 set , it was very much his territory and his agenda			0
he said : ‘ a special scene was written , called a fix with the @entity30 , which we duly rehearsed and recorded			2
‘ the other actors and i had worked hard over a couple of days to create a relaxed atmosphere , but the first and only time he saw @entity2 was when he came on the set when the cameras were rolling			2
revolved around him : @entity2 claps after @entity0 puts a ' @entity10 fixed it for me ' medal around @entity13 's neck in the scene			1
@entity0 said that while they were on a dr who set , @entity2 acted as if it was his territory and on his agenda big difference : @entity2 kisses @entity77 's hand in the scene in which @entity0 described him as ' creepy and ' patronising ' but said that there was a big difference between that and suspecting him of a sexual predator ‘ his eyes were cold and his demeanour patronising			1
i recall clearly the disappointment i felt for the young boy for whom i suspect the whole experience was daunting and overwhelming			0
‘ at least it was i who got to put the @entity10 ’ll fix it medallion around his neck			2
’ ' should have been braver ' : @entity0 said there may have been people who could or should have come forward when rumours about @entity2 surfaced speaking on the mounting abuse allegations recently made against @entity97 , @entity0 said : ‘ there is of course a huge difference between finding someone creepy and patronising and suspecting them of being a sexual predator			1
‘ i only hope that the @entity105 ’s failure to investigate him does not tarnish , in the eyes of the world , an organisation that has rightly been regarded as a bastion of honest and honourable broadcasting for decades			0
‘ there may have been individuals who could or should have been braver in confronting the unpleasant possibility of his depravity when rumours and accusations surfaced , but that is evidently also true of the hospitals and mental institutions that trusted him to the extent that he had his own set of keys for @entity126 with living quarters on the site and a bedroom at @entity130			0
‘ a picture is emerging of a man unusually adept at manipulation and concealment			0
identifying willing co-conspirators and abusers is much more important than demonising the bamboozled who may have thought their suspicions so far off the scale of decent human behaviour as to be unbelievable			0
’ @entity52 also starred in the scene where dr who accidentally teleports himself and companion @entity145 ( @entity77 ) in the tardis before unintentionally beaming ‘ earthling ’ @entity13 ( playing himself )			2
two evil sontarans are also onboard the time machine but @entity13 kills them			0
@entity2 appears and presents @entity13 with a ' @entity10 fixed it for me ' medal and a ‘ @entity153 gun ’ used by the @entity30			1
emerging picture : @entity0 met @entity2 while working as dr who from 1984 to 1986 ( left ) said recently ( right ) that as the abuse allegations mount against @entity2 , a picture of him as ' unusually adept at manipulation and concealment ' has come to light now watch the @entity162 scene featuring @entity0 and @entity2			1

@entity0 met @entity2 in the 1980s and *filmed* a dr who scene which appeared on @entity10 *'ll* fix it in 1985
@entity0 described @entity2 as ' patronising and ' self - congratulatory ' on set
