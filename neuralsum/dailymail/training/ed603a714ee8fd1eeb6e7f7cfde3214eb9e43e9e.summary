exclusive @entity38 , dubbed ‘ @entity64 ’s @entity63 ’ has claimed the title of the best place to live for a good quality of life on four separate occasions in 2006 , 2008 , 2009 and 2010			0
@entity38 in @entity32 is home to the fewest number of people whose lives are confined by illness or disability the report states : ' there is significant inequality across local authorities in @entity17 with almost three times as many people in @entity47 , @entity48 , reporting that their activities were ' limited a lot ' compared to @entity38 , @entity32			1
' the percentage of residents with day - to - day activities ' limited a lot ' was strongly related to the level of deprivation experienced by the authorities ' residents			0
' the 10 authorities with the lowest rates were the same authorities for males and females			0
' these authorities were among the least deprived in @entity17 , located in the commuter belts of @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity32 and having extensive rural and semi-rural populations			2
