@entity0 , written by editors @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , argues that even if assisted suicide was legalised , very few patients would chose to end their lives this way doctors should be allowed to help terminally ill patients to die , one of @entity13 ’s most influential medical journals says today			1
but the @entity15 ’s call for assisted suicide to be legalised provoked immediate alarm and anger in the profession			1
in an editorial , the publication – formerly the @entity15 – says the terminally ill must be allowed to ‘ call time on their lives ’ when it is in their best interests			1
senior doctors warned that such a change in the law will pressurise the elderly into wanting to end their lives for fear of being a burden on their relatives			1
the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 of @entity37 – all oppose assisted suicide and polls show most doctors share the same view			1
a recent survey by the @entity42 found that almost 80 per cent of family doctors opposed a law change to allow assisted dying			1
the @entity15 is owned by the @entity34 but has editorial independence			2
the article , written by editors @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , argues that even if assisted suicide was legalised , very few patients would chose to end their lives this way			1
it states : ‘ people should be able to exercise choice over their lives , which should include how and when they die , when death is imminent			0
‘ recognition of an individual ’s right to determine his or her best interests lies at the heart of this journal ’s strategy to advance the patient revolution in healthcare			0
’ the authors refer to @entity66 state in the @entity67 , where assisted suicide has been legal since 1997			2
only 71 patients there took life - ending medication last year , the equivalent in @entity13 to one patient for every gp practice , they claim			0
senior doctors warned that such a change in the law will pressurise the elderly into wanting to end their lives for fear of being a burden on their relatives they quote figures from the @entity83 of 2010 which found 82 per cent supported assisted dying			1
it is the first time the @entity15 has publicly backed assisted dying and the article follows calls from a leading doctor yesterday for medical staff to be trained to end lives			1
professor @entity91 , president of the @entity92 , said the law should be changed to allow medics to help patients die without fear of prosecution and there should be health professionals equivalent to midwives to administer fatal doses of medicine			0
‘ just as midwives help babies come into the world , some terminally ill patients in pain may seek the help of a health professional to end their life , ’ he said			0
but dr @entity111 , deputy chairman of the @entity34 ’s gp committee said : ‘ doctors ’ key role is to protect the vulnerable			2
‘ what we want to avoid is a situation where older people feel pressurised into requesting assisted suicide because they feel they are a burden to their relatives			1
’ former surgeon dr @entity121 , of the campaign group @entity122 , said : ‘ the @entity15 is completely out of step with the medical profession			2
the current law exists to protect the vulnerable and those without a voice : disabled , terminally ill and elderly people , who might otherwise feel pressured into ending their lives			0
’ dr @entity129 , chairman of the @entity34 council , said : ‘ there are strongly held views within the medical profession on both sides of this complex and emotive issue			0
‘ the @entity34 remains firmly opposed to legalising assisted dying			0
this issue has been regularly debated at the @entity34 ’s policy forming annual conference and recent calls for a change in the law have persistently been rejected			1
’ dr @entity140 , chairman of the @entity42 , said : ‘ good palliative and terminal care does not require assisted dying			0
’ the issue will be debated by the @entity144 this month under a @entity145 , put forward by @entity146 , which would allow terminally ill patients with less than six months to live to end their lives with a fatal dose of medicine			0
they would first have to get a form signed by two doctors			0
assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in @entity156 and @entity157 , technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison			2
the practice has been legal in the @entity160 since 2002 and around 4,000 patients a year end their lives in this way .			0
