eight members of the @entity1 are calling on the @entity2 to examine new research suggesting that some electronic cigarettes can produce dangerous carcinogens similar to those from traditional cigarettes			1
in a letter sent on thursday , the @entity9 lawmakers say that the @entity2 should work to protect e- cigarette users and those nearby from cancer - causing vapors apparently produced by high - powered nicotine devices , known as tank systems			1
electronic cigarettes mainly consist of a battery , heating coil and a tank that holds flavored liquid nicotine			2
as users puff on the e-cigarette , the battery heats the coil and the liquid is turned into a vapor that is inhaled like smoke from a traditional cigarette			0
members of the @entity1 are calling on the @entity2 to examine new research suggesting that some electronic cigarettes can produce dangerous carcinogens similar to those from traditional cigarettes tank systems are generally larger e-cigarettes - about the size of an electronic toothbrush - that can hold more nicotine and an extended battery supply			1
studies first reported by @entity40 suggest that these devices get hot enough to produce toxic chemicals like formaldehyde , a carcinogen also found in traditional cigarettes			1
e-cigarette proponents have argued that the devices are a safer alternative to cigarettes because they do not produce the smoke and tar caused by burning tobacco			2
but the new research by scientists at the @entity55 challenges that reasoning , at least for some products			0
tank systems are generally larger e-cigarettes - about the size of an electronic toothbrush - that can hold more nicotine and an extended battery supply the @entity66 , @entity67 - based center 's study is scheduled for publication later this month in the @entity70 journal , according to the @entity40			1
the findings also raise questions about the potential hazards of e-cigarettes for non-users who inadvertently inhale their vapors			0
@entity67 , @entity78 and @entity79 have all recently instituted bans on the use of e-cigarettes in certain indoor areas and public places			1
last month the @entity2 announced it would begin regulating the emerging e-cigarette field			2
but the senators point out that the @entity2 's proposal focuses mainly on e-cigarette ingredients , rather than the vapors they produce			1
' we simply can not afford to lag behind in our complete understanding of the health consequences to the user and bystander of these and other advanced nicotine delivery products , ' states the letter			0
it was signed by sens. @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity107 , @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity111 , @entity112 @entity67 , @entity78 and @entity79 have all recently instituted bans on the use of e-cigarettes in certain indoor areas and public places an @entity2 spokeswoman said in a statement that the agency is also funding research into the safety of e-cigarette vapor , including one of the studies referenced by the senators			1
' where the science does not exist , we are able to fund the research to answer key questions related to e-cigarette safety and consumer behavior			0
' in fact , @entity2 is funding dozens of studies that will help answer those questions , including four studies alone that will focus on the contents of e-cigarette vapor , ' said @entity136			0
the @entity2 is now taking public comments on its proposal , which treads fairly lightly on the $ 2 billion e-cigarette market			2
the @entity2 's plan would ban e-cigarette sales to anyone under 18 , add warning labels and require @entity2 approval for new products			0
it does not include measures favored by many anti-smoking advocates , such as a ban on tv advertising and fruit - or candy - flavored e-cigarettes			0
scientists have n't completed much research on whether e-cigarettes actually help smokers kick the habit or simply serve as a gateway to paper - and - tobacco cigarettes			2
the government is pouring millions into research to supplement independent and company studies on the health risks of e-cigarettes and other new tobacco products .			0
