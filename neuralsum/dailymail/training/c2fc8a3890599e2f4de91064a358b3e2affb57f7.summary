by @entity0 a tough mudder race that involves a military style obstacle course in muddy waters may send participants right to the bathroom line as the @entity6 warned yesterday that competitors are at risk for developing bloody and explosive diarrhea			1
after a @entity14 race in 2012 in @entity15 , public health officials at @entity11 outside @entity12 got a call from their medical center 's emergency department who said that three members of the active - duty military were vomiting and experienced bloody @entity24 three of them said that they had fallen face first in mud during a @entity14 obstacle at a cattle ranch in the town of @entity30 , reports the @entity31			1
@entity32 hits the mud during the ' @entity14 ' obstacle course event in @entity35 , @entity36 similar to the event in @entity15 where many participants became ill with bloody and explosive diarrhea @entity39 reports that at least 22 similar cases of explosive diarrhea were linked to that same race in 2012			1
the sudden diarrhea outbreak pushed the @entity6 to investigate and they found that the mud races are held on farmland that ' might be exposed to fecally contaminated water or slurry that potentially serious diarrheal disease can result if ingested , even inadvertently			1
' the @entity6 says that racers are exposed to the fecally transmitted bacteria campylobacter coli that is hazardous to health and can begin affecting the body 2 - 5 days after exposure			1
' these events typically are held in rural areas and often include man - made slurry fields ( a mixture of soil or clay and water ) as race ' challenges , ' the @entity6 says			2
' in areas commonly frequented by animals , topsoil used in the creation of slurry fields can be contaminated with feces from domestic fowl or ruminants or wild animals			0
competitors who run or ride through such areas might unintentionally swallow sufficient numbers of organisms to cause clinical disease			0
' lieutenant colonel @entity79 , the public health flight commander at @entity11 who led the research told the @entity81 that he believes more than 22 people got sick after the race in @entity15 but only a handful of the participants reported it			2

' when some racers reach the finish line , their obstacles are just beginning as they may have trouble ' letting go ' of the race entirely			0
' participants also need to be encouraged to seek appropriate medical care for post-competition diarrhea , ' the @entity6 advises , ' especially bloody diarrhea , and to inform medical personnel of their exposure			2
' other than explosive and bloody diarrhea , very few injuries have been reported .			0
