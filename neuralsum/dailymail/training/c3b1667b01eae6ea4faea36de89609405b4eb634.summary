by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 20:20 est , 7 march 2013 a @entity2 man has pleaded no contest to beheading a man in @entity5 who police say stole drugs from the @entity9 drug trafficking organization launching the grisly attack authorities fear to be spreading across the @entity12 border			1
@entity13 , 39 , entered his plea on monday to second - degree murder in the death of @entity17 , 38 , who was killed at a @entity19 apartment in 2010 after allegedly tracked by three hit men sent from @entity2			1
police believe @entity17 's gruesome killing was intended to send a message that anyone who betrays the traffickers will get the same treatment			0
@entity27 : from left , @entity28 , 22 , @entity13 , 39 , and @entity30 @entity29 , 25 , who were all in the @entity12 illegally are linked to the @entity5 stabbing and beheading but the case has been cited as an extreme example of @entity2 cartel violence spilling over the border , with cartel killings in the @entity12 rare due to fear of attention from @entity12 authorities			1
@entity2 has been plagued by decapitations in the drug war against cartels			1
headless bodies have been dangled from bridges by their feet ; severed heads have been sent to victims ' family members and government officials ; and bags of heads have been dropped off in high - profile locations			0
the @entity5 beheading also factored into the state 's contentious immigration debate			2
a month before the october beheading , @entity57 gov. @entity57 drew criticism for claiming that headless bodies were being found in the @entity5 desert as she sought to bolster her argument for confronting the state 's immigration woes			2
she later backtracked on those claims , but said such violence in the broader border region is cause enough for alarm			0
@entity69 down : @entity70 , left , was beheaded in a @entity19 apartment after the hit men were allegedly sent from @entity2 by the @entity74 / @entity9 drug cartel , their leader right , to kill him @entity76 , a @entity2 expert at the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , said he is n't aware of any other cartel - related beheadings in the @entity12 and noted that cartel killings in the @entity12 are rare , citing bosses of the criminal groups not wanting to draw attention from @entity12 authorities			1
@entity87 , a spokeswoman for the @entity88 in @entity5 , said the state has n't seen a cartel killing in the last few years and is experiencing fewer cases of smugglers stealing trafficking loads from each other			2
@entity5 has served as a hub for immigrant and drug smugglers for many years			0
forty - four percent of all marijuana seizures near the nation 's borders were made in the @entity103 's @entity102 sector from october 2011 through september 2012			0
ms @entity87 said such drug rip - offs are now infrequent in @entity5 , while in the past they were somewhat common			0
prayers : a man who overheard the victim and the three other suspects talking before the killing heard them discuss @entity110 , a @entity2 folk saint , pictured , who counts cartel members among its devotees ‘ there are consequences to be paid , ’ ms @entity87 said of drug rip - offs			1
‘ those kinds of issues are n't resolved in a court			0
they are resolved with violence			0
’ a police report that cites @entity103 intelligence said @entity17 had stolen 400 pounds of marijuana and some meth from the @entity74 / @entity9 drug trafficking organization			0
@entity17 told the cartel that the @entity103 had seized the drugs , but the cartel learned the truth and hired men to kidnap and kill him in @entity132 , @entity2			1
but @entity17 was able to talk his way out of being killed , saying he 'd pay back the money and use his house for collateral , the report said			0
it turned out that the house was n't @entity17 's , and he fled to the @entity19 area , leading the cartel to hire assassins to go to @entity5 , befriend @entity17 and kill him			1
@entity143 , a day laborer who had been living in the apartment complex where the killing occurred , is the only man to be charged in @entity17 's death			2
three men who were with @entity17 around the time of his death are believed to have fled to @entity2			1
@entity152 , a spokesman for the @entity154 's office , which prosecuted the case , said on thursday that no witnesses or evidence definitively placed the three men at the scene of the murder			2
the police report said a rival drug cartel , the @entity163 organization , was possibly planning on killing the three men			1
@entity17 was reportedly a mid-level member of that drug cartel , for which his brother also worked			2
authorities who responded to the shooting say @entity13 was wearing pants covered in blood			0
@entity172 - @entity13 's lawyer , @entity171 , had argued authorities had no evidence that @entity143 actually killed the victim and had said his client was intoxicated and did n't remember anything and did n't know the victim			1
a message left for @entity171 at midday on thursday was n’t immediately returned			0
sentencing for @entity143 , who faces 10 to 16 years in prison , is set for may 8			0
prosecutors say a man who lived in the apartment where the killing took place overheard the victim and the three other suspects talking shortly before the killing about @entity110 , a @entity2 folk saint who counts cartel members among its devotees			1
the underground saint , which is not recognized by the @entity194 , has gained in popularity in the @entity12 among immigrants , artists and gay activists .			2

@entity200 , 39 , has pleaded no contest to 2010 beheading in @entity19 apartment
only one of three suspected hit men have been arrested
cartel killings in @entity12 are said to be rare out of fear of attention from @entity12 authorities
