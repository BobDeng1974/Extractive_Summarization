by @entity1 reporter published : 17:59 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 18:03 est , 10 october 2012 diplomatic security for the @entity4 mission in @entity5 was ' a struggle ' and security teams in @entity8 were drawn down ahead of last month 's fatal attack , the former head of a @entity4 security team in @entity8 told lawmakers on wednesday			1
' diplomatic security remained weak			0
in april there was only one @entity4 diplomatic security agent stationed there , ' lieutenant colonel @entity13 told the @entity16 during @entity18 ' first hearing on the assault that killed @entity4 ambassador @entity20 and three other @entity4			1
' the situation remained uncertain and reports from some @entity8 indicated it was getting worse			2
' @entity13 said that when he arrived in @entity8 in february there were three @entity4 diplomatic special security teams in the country , but by august they had been withdrawn			1
he served as the @entity48 commander in @entity8 for six months prior to the attack			1
@entity50 said he came forward to the congressional committee after @entity20 and the three other @entity4 were killed in the assault			2
' the killing of a @entity4 ambassador is a rare and extraordinary thing and requires our attention as a people , ' he said			0
' as a citizen i made the determination that this outweighs all other interests and will risk whatever circumstances may result from my testimony			0
' in a day filled with official testimonials , another revelation came from a top diplomatic security deputy who said that she declined to approve more @entity4 security as violence in @entity5 spiked , saying the department wanted to train @entity8 to protect the consulate			1
attack : the violence at the @entity4 embassy on september 11 caused the deaths of the @entity4 ambassador @entity20 and three other @entity4 personnel ' i made the best decisions i could with the information i had , ' said @entity79 , a deputy assistant secretary for diplomatic security			1
partisan tension quickly spilled out at the hearing , with republicans accusing the @entity83 of not being fully cooperative in providing information on security decisions before the attack			2
@entity87 accused the majority republicans of conducting a one - sided probe that excluded them			2
@entity92 charges that the @entity4 was caught unprepared for the september 11 attack have put the administration of president @entity95 , a @entity96 , on the defensive ahead of the november 6 presidential election			1
republicans continued their line of attack that the administration initially issued misleading comments saying the assault was a spontaneous event that sprang from a protest against an anti-islam video			0
altered accounts : ambassador @entity109 testified on behalf of the @entity83 , saying that initially after the attack , intelligence pointed to the belief that it was due to the @entity114 video taking it in : rep. @entity116 ( right ) and rep. @entity117 ( left ) confer during the hearing where they were told that now intelligence confirms that it was a planned terrorist attack administration officials said those initial comments , including by @entity4 ambassador to the @entity125 @entity124 , resulted from the best information at that time			1
' the information she had at that point from the intelligence community is the same that i had at that point , ' testified @entity109 , the under secretary of state for management			0
however , @entity134 reported last week that within hours of the attack , the @entity95 administration received about a dozen intelligence reports suggesting militants connected to @entity139 were involved			0
insufficient : ms @entity79 said that the safe haven area within the compound was not strong enough to keep out the dozens of armed attackers @entity145 spokesman @entity144 told reporters wednesday that in hindsight ' there is no question that the security was not enough to prevent that tragedy from happening			1
there were four @entity4 killed			0
' democrats on the @entity16 tried to blame @entity99 for cutting more than $ 300 million in diplomatic security funds worldwide			0
' the fact is that , since 2011 , the @entity145 has cut embassy security by hundreds of millions of dollars below the amounts requested by the president , ' said @entity159 representative @entity117 , the committee 's senior @entity96			1
@entity161 , who was the top security official in @entity8 earlier this year , testified he was criticized for seeking more security			2
' there was no plan and it was hoped it would get better , ' he said			0
@entity161 told the committee that conversations he had with people in @entity168 led him to believe that it was ' abundantly clear we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident			0
