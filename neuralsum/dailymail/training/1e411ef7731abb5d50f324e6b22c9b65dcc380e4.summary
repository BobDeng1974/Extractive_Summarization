by @entity0 published : 18:34 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 12 july 2013 patients with existing heart problems are most at risk as the drugs can trigger a dangerous rise in chemicals linked to heart disease common indigestion drugs used by millions of @entity9 could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes , according to research			1
scientists said the drugs , called proton pump inhibitors , can trigger a dangerous rise in chemicals in the body linked with heart disease			1
patients with existing heart problems , such as angina , are at most risk , but healthy adults with no history of such complaints could also be affected , the researchers said			2
the number of prescriptions for @entity29 such as lansoprazole and omeprazole – sold over the counter as @entity33 - has doubled in recent years to more than eight million a year , costing the @entity34 around £ 400million a year			1
the exact number of patients on the drugs is not known because some buy them over the counter at high street chemists			2
@entity29 work by blocking the action of cells called proton pumps , which produce stomach acid			2
although very effective , they should only be used for a maximum of two months and preferably for between two and four weeks			0
but many patients quickly find they can not live without them and ask for repeat prescriptions from their gp or buy them at the chemist			1
previous studies identified a potential link between the drugs and heart problems , although scientists conceded there was no obvious explanation for the connection			2
now experts at the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , believe they have uncovered the reason why			0
after studying samples of human heart tissue , as well as carrying out experiments on mice , they found that @entity29 triggered an increase in a chemical called asymmetric dimethylarginine , or @entity73 , produced as the body ’s cells make proteins			0
it can hinder blood flow by blocking the release of nitric oxide , a gas which helps arteries to stay flexible and healthy			0
the drugs are prescribed to be used for a maximum of two months but many patients find them hard to live without and buy more over the counter the latest findings , published in the journal @entity89 , show @entity29 medicines increase @entity73 levels by about 25 per cent and reduce the ability of blood vessel walls to relax by more than 30 per cent			1
in a report on their findings , the researchers said : ‘ several studies have raised concern that the use of @entity29 in patients with acute coronary syndrome [ heart disease ] may increase their risk of major adverse events			1
‘ we found a plausible biological mechanism to explain this			0
’ research leader dr @entity107 said : ‘ this surprising effect needs further investigation			0
’ the same drugs have also been found to increase the dangers of osteoporosis .			0

drugs can trigger rise in chemicals that are linked with heart disease
eight million prescriptions for the proton pump inhibitors each year cost @entity34 £ 400 million
only *supposed* to be used for two months but many patients find they ca *n't* live without the drugs
