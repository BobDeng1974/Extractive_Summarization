mr @entity13 , 94 , was himself released from hospital hours after the daredevil flight , following treatment for pneumonia			1
after taking off from @entity27 , the flight path ascended to 600ft above sea level and mr @entity8 maintained this altitude for most of the flight			0
life imitates art : in the @entity18 film , @entity16 strapped hundreds of equally bright balloons to his house to transport it from the @entity22 to @entity23 take off : after taking off from @entity27 , the flight path ascended to 600ft above sea level and mr @entity8 maintained this altitude for most of the flight safety first : mr @entity8 wore a wetsuit and lifejacket as a precaution and a safety vessel accompanied the entire flight @entity86 : @entity87 , 37 , floated from the island where @entity13 spent 18 years in prison over to @entity15 farewell : @entity91 waves goodbye to his supporters before being strapped in the harness and taking to the sky 1785 - @entity97 aviator @entity96 successfully completed the first air crossing of the @entity99 , in a hydrogen balloon			1
it took two - and - a - half hours			2
1909 - pilot @entity102 became the first to cross the @entity99 in a heavier - than - air aircraft , the @entity105 monoplane			2
1979 - the first human - powered aircraft made it across			2
@entity22 @entity109 used pedal - power for his three - hour journey			1
2003 - @entity113 sky - diver @entity112 completed a 20 - mile freefall using an aerodynamic ' wingsuit ' and a carbon fin			2
2008 - @entity118 daredevil @entity117 reached 220mph using a jet - powered ' wing ' , and completed the crossing in less than 10 minutes			2

2012 - @entity121 launched a house into the sky just like in the @entity126 movie ' up '			1
at 2000m from the shoreline , he descended down to 400ft , and again at 1000m descend down to 200ft			0

in 2001 , mr @entity8 joined a medical device company that sold surgical instruments , and the @entity149 became one of his clients			0
it became clear to him that the hospital was under enormous financial pressure , as the care provided , instruments purchased and staff salaries cost considerable amounts of money			0
after moving to @entity160 in the @entity161 he decided he wanted to raise funds for charity by doing something risky and bizarre that would grab people ’s attention			0
it was then he decided to float from @entity27 to the mainland , carried by balloons , and has been planning the stunt since then			2
victory : @entity87 throws his arms up in jubilation after completing the daring flight sizing them up : @entity87 poses with balloons before embarking on his daring mission mr @entity8 co-ordinated the feat from the @entity161 , engaging with international stakeholders and garnering support from around the world			1
