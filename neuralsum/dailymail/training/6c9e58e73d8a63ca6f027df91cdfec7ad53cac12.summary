by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 12:43 est , 22 february 2013 a book that was given to @entity2 as a teenager has gone on public display for the first time since it was written 550 years ago			1
the signed book is one of only 13 of @entity2 's books that is known to still exist			1
it is especially valuable as he has signed it ' @entity12 ' as he was only the @entity13 as a young man			2
the rare book was rediscovered in a library at @entity17 in @entity18			1
books like this containing chivalric tales were given to nobles as part of their education			2
above his signature in the book he wrote the words ' @entity45 ' , which means ' so much desired '			1
historians say the motto was a chivalristic code the young duke might have adopted for tournaments			2
@entity2 , who was the @entity13 at the time , would have been received it in his early teens			1
as the fourth son of the @entity54 , he received the education of a future cleric and was more competent in @entity57 than most of his peers			0
the book has been at @entity17 since @entity60 , the @entity61 , bought it in 1709 along with several other medieval manuscripts			0
signed by @entity2 as a teenager : one of only 13 surviving books personally owned by @entity2 , which he signed ' @entity12 ' in his role as @entity13 dr @entity67 , curator at @entity17 , said : ' it is a fascinating piece of history			1
his handwriting is extremely competent , which shows he was highly educated			0
' ' within the book are tales of derring - do , as well as classical @entity74 and @entity75			0
' ' most of the books of the time were in @entity78 and @entity57 , so this one is unusual			0
' dr @entity80 is curious as to why @entity2 signed the book in the middle , instead of at the beginning or at the end , which is more traditional			1
' he may have done it as a security measure			0
' if you sign your signature at the beginning or end it is easy for somebody else to tear it out			0
but you ca n't tear out a page from the middle of a book			0
' although he has gone down in history as a hunchbacked tyrant , most historians now say that image is fictitious			0
@entity2 's modern day image is down largely to his portrayal by @entity103			1
@entity2 's body , which was found in a shallow grave in a @entity34 car park last year , is expected to finally have a proper burial at a tomb in @entity109 .			2
