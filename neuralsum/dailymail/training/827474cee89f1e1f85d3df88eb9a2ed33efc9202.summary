by @entity0 a lethal new weapon that can fire a shell at seven times the speed of sound has been successfully tested on land			1
described as ‘ @entity7 technology ’ by researchers , such a device has belonged solely to the world of science fiction for decades			1
but now it is close to a reality with sea trials on a @entity15 warship planned in two years			1
two prototypes of the weapon have been developed for the @entity26 – one by @entity30 arms manufacturer @entity28 and the second by a @entity15 firm			2
rear admiral @entity33 , head of @entity15 @entity34 , said the futuristic electromagnetic railgun – so called because it fires from two parallel rails – had already undergone extensive testing on land			2

‘ it ’s now reality and it ’s not science fiction , ’ admiral @entity33 said			2
an electromagnetic railgun is a gun that uses just electricity – no gun powder – and … can shoot a projectile well over 100 miles at @entity54			0
energetic weapons , such as @entity57 railguns , are the future of naval combat			0
’ electromagnetic launchers were one of the areas researched by @entity63 ’s @entity7 , nicknamed ‘ @entity7 ’ after the science fiction film franchise			2
admiral @entity33 added : ‘ it will help us in air defence , it will help us in cruise missile defence , it will help us in ballistic missile defence … we ’re also talking about a gun that ’s going to shoot a projectile that ’s about one one - hundredth of the cost of an existing missile system today			0
‘ it … will give our adversaries a huge moment of pause to go , “ do i even want to go engage a naval ship ? ”			0
’ the weapon uses speed rather than explosives to destroy its target and comes equipped with the menacing @entity85 motto ' i , who am speed , eradicate ' warships can carry dozens of conventional missiles , which cost around £ 600,000 each , but could be loaded with hundreds of railgun projectiles , at only £ 15,000 each			1

using an electromagnetic force known as the @entity96 , the gun accelerates a projectile between two rails that conduct electricity , before launching it at ferocious speed			0
this means the railgun can fire further than conventional guns and maintain enough kinetic energy to inflict tremendous damage			0
railguns were first conceived of nearly a century ago and patented by @entity109 inventor @entity108			0
@entity110 took up the research during the @entity112 to adapt its anti-aircraft guns			0
the first sea trials of the new railguns will take place in 2016 aboard high - speed vessel the @entity42 ( artist 's impression above )			1
