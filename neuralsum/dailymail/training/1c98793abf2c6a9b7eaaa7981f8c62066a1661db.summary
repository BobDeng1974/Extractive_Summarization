host commentator well that 's all from me folks - but thanks for tuning in ! click here to read our match report on @entity3 's brilliance			1
words can not actually describe how brilliant that performance was			0
@entity4 were good in patches , but @entity3 was just sensational			1
he contributes so much more than just his goals - and he managed to get four of those ! @entity3 scores all four of @entity4 's goals - including a perfect hat - trick - in a thumping victory			1

@entity4 have been brilliant but @entity5 are still going and @entity44 bursts clear to force a corner			1
they cross the ball in but yet again it comes to nothing			0
some people questioned him for @entity52 last season , but @entity3 has proven on the international scene he is absolutely world class			1
@entity5 test @entity56 in the final moments , however , as @entity59 puts in a wicked cross and @entity61 nods it goalwards but it is tipped over			1
@entity5 are attacking and trying to find a consolation but the @entity65 are holding firm			0
to be fair , @entity67 and @entity68 have been quietly impressive at the back as their captain has run @entity5 ragged up front			1
@entity4 's countering has been phenomenal - as has @entity3			1
@entity73 is reborn and he puts a wonderful cross with his left - foot and @entity3 is at the back post to head past the helpless @entity77			1
wow - he is something special is @entity3			2
that 's his hat - trick			1
another blistering counter see @entity3 cross the ball in and @entity73 nod a header on to the bar			1
@entity85 then smashes a shot back in which the goalkeeper can only parry and @entity3 is on hand to sweep it home			1
@entity90 , @entity91 , @entity3 and @entity92 are just dominating possession			1
they are more than happy just to pass the ball around and make the @entity97 work to get it back			0
when they break , it is electric			0
@entity3 uses his dazzling skills to bamboozle the @entity97 defence before laying off @entity90 , who slams a shot wide from the left - hand area of the box			1
the second - half has seen @entity5 fade and they just can not find a final ball into the box			2
the threat of @entity111 has vanished and it looks like no way back for them at the moment			2
for a second @entity3 thinks he is in behind again and in with a chance of getting his hat - trick after @entity119 smashes a free - kick forward			1
however , a late flag denies him the opportunity to bag a third			0
@entity5 are attacking well in spells but they can not get the final pass away and @entity4 are counter-attacking with serious pace			0
countinho sprints with the ball , eventually it gets to @entity3 and he plays it back to the @entity130 midfielder who curls his shot just wide of the far post			0
a blistering counter-attack from @entity4 sees @entity3 get the ball in the box and he jinks back before unleashing a wonderful shot just past the post and into the side netting			1
@entity92 has been brilliant since he has come on			0
@entity3 crosses in a dangerous corner and @entity68 is completely un-marked in the box			1
he swivels on the ball and then smashes on straight at @entity142 who dives well to save it			0
it is turning into a bit of a stroll in the park for @entity4 now			0
they are dominating possession and forcing @entity5 to commit fouls			0
@entity3 whips in a free - kick which is headed back across goal by @entity67 but eventually cleared			1
@entity85 has barely been on the pitch for three minutes and he has provided a delightful assist			2
a lovely left - footed outside - of - the - foot pass through the middle splits open the @entity5 defence and @entity3 coolly slots it past the advancing goalkeeper			2
long way back now for @entity5			0
@entity162 on , and @entity163 for @entity4			0
for @entity5 , @entity164 is @entity165			0
@entity3 's goal separates the sides at the break			2
@entity5 enjoy the last attack of the half as they get forward and win a corner			0
@entity173 whips the ball in and a dangerous shot from @entity59 sees the ball put back in before @entity177 fires wide			1
@entity178 fires in a free - kick from halfway inside the @entity5 half			1
the ball is flat and dips late , and @entity68 is facing away from goal			0
he gets his head on the ball though and it floats over the bar			0
this has been a very interesting game so far			0
for all of @entity4 's stars , @entity5 have looked very dangerous when they have attacked			1
@entity67 is struggling a little bit at the back for @entity4 , and both @entity192 and @entity193 have been guilty of giving away unnecessary fouls			1
@entity5 are looking to counter and it seems like that will be their best way of causing @entity4 regular problems			0
@entity199 rushes down the right - hand side and whips a delicious cross into @entity111 who gets in from of @entity192 and glances a header past the far post			1
@entity3 and @entity205 look very slick up front			1
in the match against @entity208 , @entity205 scored twice but did very little else - here he is proving to be a perfect foil for @entity3 but his lay - offs and hold - up play			1
@entity178 is starting to look lively from midfield now too			0
the free - kick to @entity5 came to nothing but they have another one out wide			0
@entity59 fires a cross in and @entity205 can only half clear it before @entity218 fires a poor shot over the bar from the edge of the area			1
@entity4 deserve to be ahead but they must be wary of the @entity97 here - they have some exciting attacking playrs with @entity59 and co. the midfielder is causing all sorts of problems with his pace and trickery			1
and @entity5 's pressure forces @entity193 to foul @entity111			1
free - kick @entity5 in a dangerous position			0
despite @entity3 's brilliance , @entity5 have been dangerous too			2
and they almost net a wonderful goal through @entity111			2
a swift attack down the left sees the ball whipped into the box and the forward lashes a left - foot half - volley just over from 18 yards			1
he has started this game like a freight train and it really should be 2 - 0			0
@entity3 strides past the @entity5 defence and lashes a fierce shot from the left - hand side of the area but it goes harmlessly past the goal			2
and @entity4 after ahead - you guessed it , it 's @entity3 ! a wonderful ball through the middle from @entity205 sets @entity3 free and he coolly rounds the keeper to sweep it home			1
@entity3 runs with the ball again towards the @entity5 defence and , just as he gets in the box , he cuts back and tries to round @entity259			2
the defender is forced to drag him back and @entity4 have a free - kick			2
the free - kick smashes the woodwork ! so unlucky from @entity3 , whose 20 - yard effort got up and down almost perfectly			2
when he is at his best , there are few better players to watch on the ball than @entity3			0
the @entity65 forward picks up the ball on halfway and runs at the @entity97 defence before being nudged over in the box			0
a bit soft so no penalty is awarded , which is the correct decision			0
the @entity97 striker has started off in a lively manner and he is causing @entity192 quite a few problems			2
@entity4 are yet to really get into this game in the manner they would have liked			0
it 's been an exciting start to the game and both @entity5 and @entity4 have had chances			2
@entity3 skipped past a few challenges early on and got close to the box but could not get his shot away			0
at the other end , @entity193 put in a wonderful tackle to deny @entity5			0
the excitement is building in @entity6 as the teams take to the pitch for the national anthems			0
@entity3 is out on the field and has completed his warm - up ahead of captaining his side once again			2
the @entity52 forward made some brilliant darting runs against @entity208 and he will look to cause the @entity97 defence all sorts of problems today			0
@entity5 beat @entity300 1 - 0 in their previous friendly and most of their @entity304 - based stars have been rested			0
seven of their starting line - up are based in @entity5 and @entity309 is among the big names to only make the bench			2
