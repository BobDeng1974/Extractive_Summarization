exclusive by @entity1 @entity2 : 04:41 est , 25 december 2013 @entity3 : 06:59 est , 25 december 2013 it may seem a far - fetched idea nowadays even when it feels bitterly cold outside , but the @entity6 has frozen over at least 23 times since the 1300s			1
the last occurrence was two centuries ago in 1814 , but in the past a number of festivals known as the @entity12 sprang up on the river			0
the period from the mid- 14th century to the 19th century in @entity15 was referred to as the ‘ @entity16 ’ due to the severity of the climate at the time			1
@entity20 of old : this 1684 oil on canvas painting called ' a @entity12 on the @entity6 at @entity24 ' shows booths , coaches , sledges , sedan - chairs and groups of people tents : a colour aquatint showing a frost fair , entitled ' @entity33 off @entity34 when frozen monday 31st january to saturday 5th february 1814 ' impression : this caricature by @entity37 and @entity38 is based on the 1814 fair , with people playing skittles and slipping over			1
a tent selling alcohol says : ' @entity43 ' and a woman near the bridge has a stall selling hot food , with the slogan : ' here 's my smoking hot sasengers a penney a peic ' paintings and memorabilia owned by the @entity55 show that when the conditions were right , @entity56 headed onto the river in celebration			0
the first recorded frost fair did not take place until 1608 , although the @entity6 had frozen over several times in the 16th century			1
it is said that @entity64 travelled all the way from @entity66 to @entity67 by sleigh along the river during the winter of 1536			2
@entity71 is also thought to have taken walks on the ice during the winter of 1564			0
centuries later , the last frost fair was held on the @entity6 in 1814			1
it took place from february 1 to 5 , and the ice was so thick at the time that an elephant crossing was held at @entity81			0
@entity82 , the museum ’s curator of archaeological collections , told @entity85 : ‘ the @entity6 is first recorded as freezing over in the 12th century			2
‘ the first time people took to the frozen river for organised entertainments was 1309 , where a hare was hunted with dogs ( and ) a fire was built on the ice			0
out of date : @entity55 curator @entity82 holds a piece of gingerbread bought at the last @entity6 frost fair of 1814			1
it is the only surviving one of its kind cutlery : a souvenir silver spoon from the frost fair of 1683 inscribed with : ' this was bought at the faire kept upon the @entity105 against @entity106 ' souvenirs : a frost fair keepsake from 1739 - 1740 printed on the @entity6 ( left )			1

a souvenir tankard from the frost fair of 1683 is pictured ( right ) ‘ between 1309 and 1814 , the surface of the @entity6 froze over at least 23 times in the @entity66 area			1
one of the main reasons for this was not due to colder temperatures , as some may think			0
' the @entity6 never froze over in the @entity66 area again ( after 1831 ) - despite temperatures dropping to -20c at times in the notoriously cold winter of 1895 ' @entity82 , @entity55 she added : ‘ it was actually to do with the structure of @entity131 at the time			1
it had 19 arches and each of the 20 piers was supported by large breakwaters called " starlings "			0
‘ when chunks of ice got caught between them , it slowed the flow of the river above the bridge , making it more likely to freeze over			0
when @entity146 opened in 1831 it only had five arches			0
' once this structure was in place , the @entity6 never froze over in the @entity66 area again - despite temperatures dropping to -20c at times in the notoriously cold winter of 1895			1
’ weeks of hard frosts led to the @entity6 being frozen , with traders sensing a chance to sell souvenirs - and dozens of shops put in place overnight			2
unlicensed gambling , drinking and dancing were held at the fairs , along with stalls selling food and drink , skittle alleys and fairground rides			1
fun : in this 1677 painting by @entity169 , ' the @entity12 , looking eastwards towards @entity131 ' , people are shown enjoying themselves on the ice woodcut : an artist 's impression of the frost fair on the @entity6 in 1715 - 1716			1
this view is taken from near @entity176 , with @entity131 in the background old times : an engraving of the 1814 fair , looking upstream towards @entity180 and @entity181			2
two tents are labelled ' @entity183 ' and ' @entity184 ' souvenirs and personalised keepsakes were also available for a few pennies , with printers setting up printing presses			1
at the last fair in 1814 it was said that there were up to 10 printing presses in operation , also making cards and popular sheet - music of the time			2
a caricature from that year ’s fair showed the patriotism of the time - during the napoleonic wars - with the @entity203 flag and injured war veterans			0
tents called ' @entity206 ' and ' @entity207 ' can also be seen , named after the 38 - gun ship @entity206 and admiral @entity207			0
