the @entity0 , the ocean current that brings mild weather to northern @entity3 and balmy conditions to the south east of the @entity6 , is slowing at its fastest rate in 1,000 years			1
new research has revealed that the enormous currents that circulate warm and cold water around the @entity11 has slowed by 15 - 20 per cent over the past century			1
scientists say that the increasing flow of fresh water from melting @entity16 ice sheets may be driving the slowdown			1
the graphic above shows the sea in the @entity11 is cooler than the surrounding ocean due to the influx of fresh water from the melting of the @entity16 ice sheet , which has slowed the gulf stream , say scientists professor @entity26 , an oceans physicist at the @entity27 for @entity28 , said : ' it is conspicuous that one specific area in the @entity11 has been cooling in the past hundred years while the rest of the world heats up			1
' now we have detected strong evidence that the global conveyor has indeed been weakening in the past hundred years , particularly since 1970			0
climate change could make the food we eat taste worse , according to recent research			2
a major report on the impact of global warming on food has predicted that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase			0
the researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common , meat like chicken and beef will become stringier and tougher			0
carrots are likely to lose their flavour and develop a less pleasant texture			0
beetroots and onions will become smaller while milk will contain less protein needed to make cheese			0
a separate study by marine biologists has also shown that shellfish will take on a sour flavour as our oceans acidify			0
they warn that as the planet 's oceans grow more acidic , due to rising carbon dioxide levels , many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising			0
shrimp raised in water with a lower ph were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting , while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest			0
the findings suggest that as global temperatures rise due to climate change , areas that are warmed by the @entity0 could see temperatures fall , particularly in the winter			1
the @entity0 is a powerful current that forms part of the @entity11 meridional overturning circulation			2
this is a system of currents that are driven by the rising and sinking of water in different regions of the @entity11			2
warm water from the equator is driven north towards the @entity94 where it cools , increases in salinity and sinks to the ocean depths			0
this drives deep sea currents that pump water back to the equator , where it is warmed , rising to the surface and feeding the currents towards the pole			0
in the @entity106 , cold salty water sinks to the ocean depths , driving deep sea currents down to the equator where warmer water then rises to the surface and feeds the @entity0			1
the influx of warm water from the equator , which travels up through the @entity114 , past @entity115 and then up the west side of @entity117 and @entity118 , helps to warm weather systems in @entity3			0
it makes winter conditions in much of northern @entity3 far milder than they normally would be , keeping @entity117 and the west coast of @entity118 largely snow and ice free through the winter months			1
the researchers , whose study is published in the journal @entity129 , found that the sea in the northern @entity11 is colder than predicted by computer models			1
they estimate that 8,000 cubic kilometres of fresh melt water haver flowed into the northern @entity11 from @entity16 's icesheets between 1900 and 1970			1
the @entity11 meridional overturning circulation is the northwards flow of warm surface water ( shown in red by in the graphic above ) and the southwards flow of cold water in the deep ocean ( shown in blue ) they say between 1970 and 2000 an additional 13,000 cubic kilometres of fresh water has poured into the @entity11 from @entity16			1
this fresh water is less dense than the salty water of the ocean and tends to float on the surface , disturbing the balance that causes cold water to sink in that region			2
usually freezing sea ice in the arctic causes the salinity of the ocean water to increase and so become more dense			2
adding fresh water dilutes this effect			2
using recent sea surface and atmospheric temperature data , along with data from ice - cores , tree rings and sediments , they found that the changes in the ocean currents are unprecedented since the year @entity168			1
however , the researchers also found that the cooling above the @entity11 may also help to slightly reduce the effect of warming on the continents due to climate change			1
the melting of @entity16 's ice sheets ( above ) is leading to an influx of freshwater into the @entity11 they warn , however , that if the circulation weakens too much it could even break down completely			1
professor @entity182 said : ' if the slowdown of the @entity11 overturning continues , the impacts might be substantial			0
' disturbing the circulation will likely have a negative effect on the ocean ecosystem , and thereby fisheries and the associated livelihoods of many people in coastal areas			0
' a slowdown also adds to the regional sea - level rise affecting cities like @entity196 and @entity197			0
' finally , temperature changes in that region can also influence weather systems on both sides of the @entity11 , in @entity202 as well as @entity3			0
' professor @entity203 , from the @entity204 and @entity16 , said it appeared man - made climate change was responsible for the slow down of the @entity0 and may worsen as global temperatures increase			1
he said : ' the human - caused mass loss of the @entity16 ice sheet appears to be slowing down the @entity11 overturning â€“ and this effect might increase if temperatures are allowed to rise further			2

scientists at the @entity216 found the sea in the @entity11 is far colder than computer models predict
they say ocean currents that drive the @entity0 has slowed by 15 - 20 *%*
the researchers claim fresh water from melting ice sheets may be to blame
they say flow of melt water has *accelerated* recently due to climate change
weakened @entity0 may mean more *severe* winters in northern @entity3
water temperatures around @entity235 and east coast of @entity6 could also suffer
