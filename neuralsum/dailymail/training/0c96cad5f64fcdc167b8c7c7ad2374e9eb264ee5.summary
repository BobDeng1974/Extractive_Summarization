by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 faced fresh mockery today after a second @entity5 attack advert in a week backfired			2
the party released a poster accusing @entity8 and @entity9 of being ' two peas in a pod ' and putting £ 450 on a family 's food bill			1
it said @entity16 's 2010 vat hike to 20 per cent had caused the price of the weekly shop to rocket			0
but the poster featured a host of everyday items that carry no vat at all - because they are deemed essential by the government			1
@entity5 's new attack on the @entity27 accused @entity9 and @entity8 of acting together to hike the cost of the weekly shop			1
but most of a family 's everyday food bill is vat free the botched attack ad came just days after the party was accused of resorting to a ' crass ' class war after releasing a party political broadcast featuring @entity9 as the ' un-credible shrinking man '			1
today 's poster shows the prime minister and @entity41 leader surrounded by images of everyday goods , including fruit and vegetables , soft drinks , ketchup and biscuits			2
but most food and drink carries no vat - although duty is charged on specific products such as alcohol , crisps and savoury snacks , and confectionery			1
however , even the chocolate chip cookies used in @entity5 's poster campaign appear to be vat - free			1
according to @entity66 rules , ' biscuits covered or partly covered in chocolate or some other products similar in taste and appearance to chocolate are standard - rated ' at 20 per cent			2
but ' chocolate chip biscuits where the chips are either included in the dough or pressed into the surface before baking ' are vat free			2
only when biscuits are ' wholly or partly coated ' in chocolate do they carry @entity23 , according to @entity74 's bizarre rules			0
however , they are at pains to point out that the classic ' bourbon ' biscuit ' and other biscuits where the chocolate or similar product forms a sandwich layer between two biscuit halves ' are not taxed at all			0
' jaffa cakes and biscuits coated with caramel ' are also vat free			2
@entity86 mp @entity85 accused @entity5 of not knowing what they were talking about			1
he said : ' it 's the same old economic incompetence from @entity5			0
they have no long - term plan to fix the economy so instead @entity2 resorts to political gimmicks that do n't even add up			1
' a spoof of the @entity5 ad was almost immediately created online , replacing mr @entity8 and mr @entity9 with @entity5 's leading figures mr @entity2 and @entity97			1
the impromptu rebuttal says : ' @entity99 , two eds with no idea			0
' the @entity86 immediately flipped the @entity5 attack back on @entity2 - accusing him of being so ' out of touch ' he did not know food was vat - free but a @entity5 spokesman said : ' @entity8 and @entity9 are desperately trying to deflect from the truth of their vat bombshell			1
' their decision to increase vat has added £ 450 to family bills over the year , on the @entity66 's own figures			1
' families are paying more on their typical weekly shop as a result of the @entity86 and the @entity41 and this poster rightly holds them to account			1
' it is not an itemised list of everything they have increased vat on - it is a representation of an average shopping basket			2
' earlier this week mr @entity2 faced criticism from members of his own party over its ' un-credible shrinking man ' political broadcast			1
by the end of the film – a parody of the @entity137 1957 movie @entity138 – he is a tiny doll - like figure			2
the ad is thought to be the first product of @entity5 's new collaboration with @entity137 election guru @entity157 one @entity86 ‘ minister ’ suggests he should be hunted , before an actor playing the @entity159 sets the @entity162 cat on him			2
the @entity137 - style attack ad is thought to be the first product of @entity5 ’s relationship with @entity137 elections guru @entity157			0
a @entity5 source said : ‘ it was aimed at younger people who do n’t usually engage with politics and we think it has been effective			0
’ party election campaign co-ordinator @entity171 said the film was ‘ a bit of fun ’ but made a ‘ serious point ’			0
but critics in the party say its relentlessly negative message suggested a lack of ambition			0
some mps said it recalled the 2008 @entity185 by - election when an attempt to paint @entity86 candidate @entity188 as a toff backfired and led to a humiliating defeat			1
one former minister described the film as ‘ crass ’			0
he added : ‘ we tried waging class war in @entity195			0
it failed then and it will fail now			0
' the trouble is the kids in the leader ’s team are probably too young to remember that			0
’ another @entity5 mp said the broadcast was ‘ depressing ’ , adding : ‘ where was the positive vision to attract swing voters ? ’ @entity206 , editor of the influential grassroots website @entity208 , said the film lacked a ‘ positive agenda ’			0
left - wing @entity212 columnist @entity211 said it was ‘ a classic example of politics with the hope stripped away ’			0
the advert takes place around the @entity219 table as ' posh ' @entity86 lead by an actor playing @entity8 force @entity9 to backtrack on policies such as tuition fees as @entity9 abandons each of the policies he shrinks into his suit			1
however @entity5 critics say the ad does n't mention @entity134 or their party mr @entity9 tried to laugh off the film ’s efforts to ridicule him			1
he said : ‘ they spent money on this ? particularly from @entity2 who is the sort of missing man in @entity239 politics			0
‘ he has n’t breathed a word about the issue we ’re supposed to be debating , which is whether we ’re in or out of @entity134			0

new poster accuses @entity8 and @entity9 of being ' two peas in a pod '
says the pair have hiked food bills by £ 450 a year
but @entity86 say food and other essentials are tax free
comes just days after party political broadcast *flopped*
