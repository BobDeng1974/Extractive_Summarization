@entity1 's opposition conservatives swept commandingly into power last night as voters enduring a 21.5 per cent unemployment rate and stagnant economy spectacularly dumped the @entity6			1
the @entity7 , led by @entity8 , won 186 seats in the 350 - seats lower chamber of parliament compared to 154 in the last legislature , while the @entity13 plummeted from 169 to 110 , their worst performance ever			1
the @entity7 won an absolute majority and resounding mandate from a deeply troubled electorate - it needed 176 votes for such a cushion			1
@entity20 : future prime minister @entity8 , pictured with his wife @entity22 , waves to supporters from the balcony of @entity7 headquarters in @entity27 last night jubilation : ecstatic supporters wave flags after news of the win is announced			1
but mr @entity8 warned them of tough times ahead in his victory speech the election result marks the third time in as many weeks that the eurozone debt crisis has claimed a government			1
as thousands of jubilant , cheering supporters waving red - and - yellow @entity1 flags and blue - and - white party ones gathered outside @entity7 headquarters , their leader and future prime minister thanked @entity1 for their support			1
but , in a sign of the current economic turmoil , mr @entity8 then sounded a sombre note of warning			1
he said : ' it is no secret to anyone that we are going to rule in the most delicate circumstances @entity1 has faced in 30 years			2
' for me , there will be no enemies but unemployment , the deficit , excessive debt , economic stagnation and anything else that keeps our country in these critical circumstances			2
' ' there wo n't be any miracles , ' he added			0
' we never promised any			0
but as we have said before , when things are done properly , the results come in			0
' socialist party candidate @entity72 conceded defeat			0
prime minister @entity74 , whose popularity plummeted as the crisis deepened and enacted austerity measures that doomed him among supporters , did not seek a third term in office , or speak publicly last night			1
but mr @entity72 said his party would fight to protect the welfare state from social spending cuts that mr @entity8 will almost certainly make to meet @entity85 - mandated deficit reduction cuts his party has pledged to fulfil			1
season of change : the election result marks the third time in as many weeks that the eurozone debt crisis has claimed a government , following in the footsteps of @entity94 and @entity95 tall order : mr @entity8 and party members face their public after @entity1 resoundingly ushered in a new political era seal it with a kiss : mr and mrs @entity8 embrace as they celebrate becoming @entity1 's first couple in the @entity106 , with 58 per cent of the votes counted , it was 134 for the @entity7 and 50 for the @entity13			1
another few dozens seats in that chamber are not elected directly			2
one surprise outside the economic realm is that a new pro-independence @entity112 coalition called @entity113 won seven seats and now outnumbers the region 's traditionally strongest party , the moderate @entity115 , with five			2
this comes about a month after the armed @entity112 separatist group @entity118 declared an end to its armed campaign , saying it would seek independence through strictly peaceful means			0
the promised change in political direction failed to immediately lift financial markets , with @entity27 's key @entity126 today down nearly 2 per cent in early trading			0
@entity1 's key borrowing rate for ten - year bonds on the secondary market started a second week edging toward 6.5 per cent , close to levels where other eurozone countries such as @entity94 , @entity133 and @entity134 had to request huge bailouts from the @entity85 and the @entity136			0
a 7 per cent rate is considered unsustainable over the long term			0
other than promise tax cuts for small - and medium - size companies that make up more than 90 per cent of all firms in @entity1 , mr @entity8 has not specified how he will tackle @entity1 's unemployment nightmare			1
the 56 - year - old faces the towering task of restoring investor confidence and lowering @entity1 's soaring borrowing costs with deficit - reducing measures , while not dragging an already moribund economy into a double - dip recession			0
it only just climbed out of one last year that was prompted by the bursting of a housing market bubble			0
mr @entity8 said he has not promised miracles and there will be none , but that the @entity7 has shown in the past - it ruled from 1996 to 2004 and got @entity1 into the euro along the way - it gets things done			1
he appealed to @entity1 to join together and resurrect the economy			0
mr @entity8 , who has lost two previous elections , said : ' we stand before one of those crossroads that will determine the future of our country , not just in the next few years but for decades			1
' the conservatives won roughly 45 per cent of the votes and the @entity13 took 29 per cent , according to official election results			2
in the last elections in 2008 , the latter won by about four points			0
loser : @entity6 leader @entity72 concedes defeat after the results came in last night not all fun and games : protesters burn a rag doll depicting mr @entity8 at the @entity181 square in @entity27 the @entity7 won most seats in 45 of the country 's 52 provinces			1
the result , together with a clean sweep in municipal and regional elections in may , left it in its strongest position ever			0
it also meant that unlike the outgoing @entity6 government , the @entity7 will not have to rely on support from any other political party to implement its policies			1
curiously , the @entity7 only edged up from 10.2million to 10.8million votes , while the @entity13 ' vote plummeted from 11.1million in 2008 to 6.9million			2
that was to the benefit of smaller parties such as the @entity198 , which saw its seat numbers shoot from two in 2008 to 11 this year			0
the new numbers show @entity1 voters have shifted decidedly to the right as they confront their worst economic crisis in decades and choose new leaders to pull them out of it			2
as part of that mess , the country is also at the forefront of @entity211 's sovereign debt crisis , with the @entity1 government 's borrowing costs rising last week to levels near where other eurozone countries such as @entity94 , @entity133 and @entity134 had to request huge bailouts from the @entity85 and the @entity136			0
besides the recent changes in which @entity94 and @entity95 replaced their governments with teams made up of technocrats , @entity133 and @entity134 - which also required huge bailouts to avert default - also saw their governments change hands .			0

@entity8 elected prime minister by a wide margin
@entity7 wins 186 seats , while @entity6 picks up just 110
socialists suffer their worst election performance ever
amid scenes of jubilation , mr @entity8 warns of troubled times ahead
