by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 12:44 est , 14 march 2013 jurisprudence : @entity2 , mayor of @entity3 , recommended @entity5 judges take tips from @entity8 films a @entity5 mayor has told judges to watch @entity8 films to help them deal with moral dilemmas in important cases			1
@entity2 , the mayor of @entity3 , said tense courtroom dramas and heart - wrenching action movies could teach them valuable lessons about dispensing justice			1
in the unorthodox contribution during a panel discussion at the @entity20 in @entity21 , mr @entity2 argued that in a @entity8 narrative , good will overcome evil , juries can be swayed by a compelling speech and a hero is often torn between emotions and a rational choice			1
but all such genres can provide helpful guidance for judges , he said			0
although mr @entity2 did not name any films specifically , some were recognisable from the plot			0
they included the 1996 action film @entity36 in which a renegade general , played by @entity38 , takes over @entity40 prison and threatens to use chemical weapons against @entity43 citizens until @entity44 and @entity45 save the day			0
although a smash hit at the box office , the film , produced by the same team behind @entity50 , was not considered a masterpiece by critics			0
movie magic : mr @entity2 appeared to make reference to the 1996 film @entity36 starring @entity44 and @entity45 film lessons : perhaps mr @entity2 was referencing the 1992 classic @entity58 when he said @entity43 lawyers can ' seduce the jury 's emotions ' but mr @entity2 evidently felt some wise lessons could be drawn in between the car chases , explosions and combat scenes			1
certainly @entity67 's character , who has been held in a @entity43 prison without trial for 30 years because he was accused of stealing state secrets , could be recognised in @entity5 's often opaque justice system			2
mr @entity2 drew particular attention to the fact he is convinced to help the authorities thwart the terrorist plot in exchange for his freedom			0
he also made reference to @entity43 lawyers and their knack for turning a seemingly impossible - to - win case around			2
' it 's important to see how @entity43 lawyers seduce the jury 's emotions , ' he said			1
there was one caveat however to the mayor 's endorsement of judges taking up film studies - they should only watch movies on their days off .			0
