by @entity0 published : 04:04 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 07:39 est , 2 august 2012 @entity1 and his cabinet colleagues have discussed fully nationalising the @entity3 because they are angry about how little @entity5 banks are lending			0
senior members of the @entity7 want to buy out the remaining 18 per cent of the institution and then ramp up how much it loans out to boost the @entity5 's depressed economy			1
@entity3 is already 82 per cent publicly - owned and a further £ 5 billion would be needed to complete a taxpayer - funded takeover			1
deal : @entity5 giant @entity3 is already 82 % taxpayer owned and the government is said to have discussed buying up the remaining shares chancellor @entity16 is opposed to fully nationalising @entity3 , which would mean taxpayers taking full responsibility for the bank 's toxic debts			1
but his rival , @entity22 business secretary @entity21 , is in favour of a split in @entity3 to create a business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending			1
a @entity30 spokesman told @entity31 : ' this is wild speculation : we are committed to repairing and returning @entity3 to full health so that it is able to support the @entity5 economy in the future , and the current strategy is working to achieve that			0
' the government ’s policy has always been to return @entity3 to the private sector , but only when it delivers value for money for the taxpayer			0
' yesterday the chancellor launched his latest scheme to free up credit by offering lower interest rates to banks , but some at the top of @entity41 believe forcing @entity3 to lend more is the only way to push the banks into action and get money to cash - starved businesses in particular			2
' we can understand why @entity59 did n't want to do this : it would be politically disastrous for them to nationalise a bank , ' one senior adviser told the @entity63 but added the banking sector would be much less worried if the @entity7 made this move			2
split : chancellor @entity16 is said to be opposed to any full takeover of @entity3 but business secretary @entity21 is believed to be more open to it this would mean directing the bank to increase its lending to companies , which would be open to legal challenge by the remaining shareholders			1
the only way to get round this is to buy out those shareholders			0
a full nationalisation was not on the agenda , an industry source also said , citing several reasons why the @entity30 would not have the appetite for such a move			0
in addition to the extra cost , @entity83 regulators would be unlikely to allow a state - owned @entity3 to aggressively undercut rivals on lending , and the government would attract more criticism for bonuses , lending and issues like the @entity94 interest rate rigging scandal if it wholly owned @entity3 , he said .			0

@entity97 consider buying remaining 18 % of bank for £ 5 billion
they could then control how much it lends and offer more cash
@entity16 is opposed but @entity21 and others keen to control its loans book
