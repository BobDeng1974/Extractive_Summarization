by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:55 est , 15 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:53 est , 17 december 2013 plea : @entity3 with her baby , whose identity has been obscured for legal reasons the mother whose baby daughter was snatched by social workers after a forced caesarean has written a poignant letter to her ‘ little princess ’ promising never to forget her			1
@entity3 begged the @entity13 last night to pass the letter to her 15 - month - old girl , now being cared for by @entity17 social services and being lined up for new adoptive parents against the mother ’s wishes			1
‘ i want to tell my daughter what i feel and how much i care , ’ said miss @entity3 , 35 , from her home town near @entity22 , @entity23			1
‘ i am not allowed to speak to her or see her any more and , if she is adopted , this letter may be the last time i can get a message to her			1
’ in near perfect @entity33 and on paper dotted with drawings of hearts , the letter tells her daughter : ‘ i miss you so so so much			1
’ miss @entity3 writes that ‘ i pray @entity39 every day to protect you ’ and describes her hopes that they will be reunited one day			2
the letter goes on : ‘ please always remember that i love you and i wanted you to be with me			2
’ miss @entity3 , who has two other daughters , is at the centre of a major international row over a @entity48 family court ’s secret decision to force her , without her consent , to have a caesarean in an @entity52 hospital on august 24 last year before her baby was removed by social workers for adoption			1
miss @entity3 was seven months pregnant and on a training course at @entity56 to be an air hostess when she had a panic attack and called the police for help			2
she had stopped taking her medicine for a bipolar complaint in case it harmed her unborn child			2
officers took her to hospital where she was sectioned under the @entity68 and , later , was forced to have a caesarean under anaesthetic so she could not protest			0
she told the @entity13 : ‘ i was marched into a hospital operating theatre and pushed on to a bed			0
they put a mask over my face			0
when i woke up the baby had arrived			2
’ heartfelt : miss @entity3 says it may be the ' last time i can get a message to her ' miss @entity3 has seen her baby ten times			1
on the last occasion , in may this year , she was told to say a final goodbye to her daughter by social workers at a council centre in @entity17			1
the child was introduced to prospective new parents in october and has since seen the couple regularly in preparation for her planned adoption in the next few weeks			2
@entity23 and @entity33 lawyers acting for miss @entity3 are preparing to challenge the adoption @entity93 case has caused an uproar and is now being overseen by sir @entity96 , @entity33 ’s most senior family judge			1
miss @entity3 has told the @entity13 that she has sent previous letters to her daughter			1
but she fears they have not been read to the child by @entity17 social workers			1
dear @entity101 , i miss you so so so much and i think about you all the times			0
i wonder how you are doing and what are you doing			0
i pray @entity39 every day to protect you , keep you away from evil and to bless you			0
you are my little princess			0
i did not see you since may and i can imagine how big you are right now ! i pray @entity39 that one day you could reunify with me and your sisters cause we love you so much			0
i want the best for you and i wish they would have give us a home to be together			0
i do n’t know when i am gon na see you again but i know that one day we will ... i am positive about that and i have faith			0
please always remember that i love you and i wanted you to be with me			0
i send you all my love and pray that our angel will look after you			0
your mother at an @entity33 court hearing this spring , the judge said she was intelligent and articulate			0
however , he ruled that because miss @entity3 might stop her bipolar drugs at some time during her daughter ’s childhood , the adoption should go ahead			1
a spokesman for @entity17 social services promised the mother ’s letter would be passed to the child if miss @entity3 sends it to social workers from @entity23			1
the spokesman insisted that previous letters had not arrived .			0

@entity3 *desperately* wants her daughter to know she cares
' this letter may be the last time i can get a message to her ' , she said
the baby is with @entity17 social services and is up for adoption
