by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's players have fixed the title in their sights after finding the secret to winning a trophy and hearing @entity9 claim he has more attacking prowess at his disposal than he has had for years			1
after winning the @entity13 and the @entity14 , there is a mood of optimism at the @entity17 that this can be the season when they can mount a serious challenge for the @entity21 title			1
' that is the target , ' said striker @entity23			1
' last year we did well until march			2
we had a bad run after but we really wanted to come back and be stronger than last year			2
when our @entity26 join us we will be stronger for sure and hopefully until may			2
' sharp shooter : @entity23 scored as @entity3 eased to victory over @entity29 at @entity30 first of many : @entity3 celebrate with the @entity14 but will have their sights set on bigger prizes @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 returned to the @entity3 training ground on monday for the first time since their @entity40 triumph			1
@entity9 would rather not rush the @entity26 trio back into action but @entity36 may have to be involved against @entity43 on saturday because there is a shortage of centre - halves			1
@entity47 came off at @entity30 as a precaution after feeling tightness in his achilles but hopes to be fit			2
up front , however , there will be a wealth of options when everyone is available , with @entity56 , signed from @entity57 for Â£ 32million , adding pace and excitement			0
@entity60 will improve in his second year at the club and @entity62 has been recalled after a series of loan moves			0
' we have a good quality squad and now the quantity so that 's why i think we will be stronger this year , ' said @entity23			1
' i have played with @entity56 in training and have a good understanding with him			2
it is like when @entity34 signed			1
it 's always easy to play with these kind of players			0
' he has different qualities to me , @entity78 and @entity62			0
he can bring his pace and technique into the centre and he 's a great finisher			0
maybe he will need some more games to adapt his game to the @entity21 but that 's normal and he 's a fantastic player so i think he will have a great season			1
' @entity26 giants : @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity34 had an extended pre-season break main man : big things are expected of @entity56 after his move from @entity57 @entity3 's last title win was in 2004 , when they completed the season without defeat and @entity95 admitted there was a growing sense of excitement about the season about to start			1
three days after they start against @entity43 , @entity9 's team will face @entity101 in @entity102 in the first leg of their @entity105 play - off			2
they play @entity107 , @entity29 and @entity108 before the end of september			1
' we 're looking strong , ' said @entity95			0
' it was a great result against @entity29			1
we 're not reading too much into it but i thought we played well and it looks like we 're more than ready			0
we defended really well and limited them to a couple of chances			0
' there was a sly dig from the goalkeeper at @entity121 , who quit the @entity17 on a free transfer to @entity29 and has been replaced by @entity123			1
' except for @entity125 we 've not lost any key players , ' he said			0
' even if someone did leave on a free , we 've managed to replace them with good players			0
' we 're looking stronger and we 're happy with that			0
looking at it on paper , it probably is the strongest squad we 've had in my time			0
hopefully it will be the most successful			0

@entity3 beat @entity29 3 - 0 in the @entity14
@entity23 *confident* @entity138 can now win @entity21
@entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 have returned to training
