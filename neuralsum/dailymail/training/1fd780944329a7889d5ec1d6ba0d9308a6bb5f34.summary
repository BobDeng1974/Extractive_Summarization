by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 17:00 est , 7 december 2012 when @entity2 took early retirement , he wanted a home with views of unspoilt countryside			1
but eight months after buying his dream bungalow , mr @entity2 was aghast to discover that the local council planned to build @entity10 ’s largest renewable energy plant surrounding it			1
if the plans go through , there will be half a million huge solar panels and several wind turbines only 100 yards from his front door			1
there will also be an 8ft security fence bristling with @entity19 cameras			2
anger : @entity2 , owner of @entity21 in @entity22 is understandably upset as his property could be covered by 500 acres of solar panels and five wind turbines father - of - three mr @entity2 , 47 , said there was no evidence of the scheme when his solicitors carried out searches before he spent £ 225,000 on his home in @entity32 , @entity33 , and a further £ 18,000 building a garage			1
he claims it is now almost worthless but he has been offered no compensation or the opportunity to relocate			2
‘ my views are going to be completely spoilt			0
i will look out of my house to see solar panels , huge wind turbines practically in my garden , and they want to install @entity19 cameras			1
‘ i may as well commit a crime and go to jail as i would probably have a better quality of life			0
this is not a case of “ not in my back yard ”			0
it is a huge solar and wind farm surrounding my bungalow			1
’ details : the plan for the energy farm mr @entity2 said he was shocked when he received a letter from @entity57 - run @entity56 telling him of the scheme , which was originally intended to cover 3,000 acres			1
this was downgraded to a £ 140million scheme on 900 acres , producing enough energy to power more than 22,000 homes			0
there would be nearly 500,000 solar panels and mr @entity2 said he has been told informally there would also be five wind turbines sited near his home			1
nine other people affected by the scheme – all tenant farmers renting council land – have been offered new land and compensation			0
mr @entity2 , a retired water company engineer , said the first he heard of the plan was in a letter to ‘ @entity75 ’ last summer			2
‘ why have they not been down to see me rather than just posted an impersonal letter ? ’ he said			0
‘ it seems like a done deal and they have their fingers in their ears			2
i am in favour of renewable energy but the council has tons of other land where they could build this farm			0
’ eyesore : how the field might look covered in solar panels other homeowners complained they learned of the development only through word of mouth			1
farmer @entity96 said : ‘ it ’s very distressing			0
people will lose their livelihoods and homes			0
’ the scheme was discussed at a full council meeting and has entered the formal planning @entity103 is part of a ‘ gold rush ’ of applications submitted ahead of a cut in government subsidies for such projects and would be funded by government grants and private investment			0
a contractor would install the solar panels but it would be managed by the council ’s energy services company , @entity116 @entity56			1
@entity56 said the solar farm would make £ 100million profit over 25 years that would be invested in ‘ frontline services ’			2
a council spokesman said locals ’ concerns had to be balanced ‘ against the needs of @entity56 ’s 184,000 - plus residents ’ .			0
