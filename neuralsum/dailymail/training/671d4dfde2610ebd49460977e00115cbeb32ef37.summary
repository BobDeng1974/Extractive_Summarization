by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 13:30 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 15:13 est , 6 november 2013 @entity3 judges have ordered @entity4 to stop providing links to the sadomasochistic private life of former @entity8 chief @entity7			1
in a landmark ruling in @entity1 , they agreed that the 73 - year - old should have all details of his sexual past erased from the internet giant 's search engine			1
it follows the defunct newspaper the @entity18 publishing videos and nine photos of @entity7 taking part in an @entity22 orgy in 2008			2
@entity7 : all details of the @entity8 boss ' sexual past will be erased from the @entity4 search engine although @entity7 , former president of the @entity29 motor racing organisation , successfully sued for breach of privacy and won £ 60,000 in damages from the paper , the images can still be found on the worldwide web			1
now @entity4 will have to introduce a filter to prevent the material appearing in any search results , after @entity7 successfully argued that sexual activity is a private matter			1
lawyers for @entity4 had told the @entity41 in @entity1 that the request was a ' legal aberration ' which ' undermine the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information on the internet '			0
the ruling comes after the @entity18 published images and videos of mr @entity7 's sex life @entity53 , associate general counsel at @entity4 , said : ' this decision should worry all those who defend freedom of expression on the internet			1
' @entity4 has two months to comply with the order			0
the court also fined the firm a symbolic € 1 and ordered it to pay € 5,000 ( £ 4,205 ) in court costs			0
mr @entity7 's legal team failed to secure a broader ruling which would have also forced @entity4 to block access to any further extracts from the video which may emerge in the future			2
@entity4 said it had , at mr @entity7 's request , already taken steps to ensure hundreds of pages whose content could be deemed to breach the law in some countries are excluded from its search results			2
at the heart of the legal debate is the question over whether companies like @entity4 should be obliged to play a role in policing the internet			0
the company says no to that and believes its stance is supported by a @entity84 directive ( law ) on e-commerce which should take precedence over privacy			0
@entity89 graduate @entity7 is the youngest son of the late @entity91 fascist sir @entity90 .			0

all images and videos will be removed from search engine after ruling
landmark case comes after @entity18 published material in 2008
@entity4 say *proposed* filter would be a ' *dangerous* *censorship* tool '
