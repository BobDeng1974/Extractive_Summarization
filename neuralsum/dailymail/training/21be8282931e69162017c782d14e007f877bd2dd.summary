the @entity0 failed to mention her @entity2 ancestors in her 1972 christmas day tv broadcast for fear of provoking a ‘ snide ’ public backlash , according to previously unseen official papers			1
they show she had planned to refer to her ‘ continental relations ’ but had a change of heart after talks at the highest levels of government			1
the seeming embarrassment about her close family ties echoed that of the @entity16 , when fierce @entity18 feeling led to the @entity19 changing its name from @entity21 to @entity22			0
@entity0 with the then prime minister @entity23 ( left ) and @entity26 president @entity25 ( right ) in 1972 , the then prime minister @entity23 – who had been shown the speech in advance – told the @entity0 she could refer to @entity30 ’s forthcoming membership of the @entity31 in her @entity33 broadcast only if her comments were personal and stressed her own ties with @entity36			1
but on december 1 , 1972 , sir @entity37 , @entity23 ’s principal private secretary , told him : ‘ you suggested [ the @entity0 ] might make her references to @entity36 personal : referring to the historical links we have with @entity36 ... or her own personal ties of kinship with families in many parts of @entity36			1
in the end her advisers have felt this would make the broadcast longer than she wishes ; they also fear references to her continental relations will give rise to snide remarks			1
’ the @entity19 gained the @entity21 name when the @entity0 ’s great - great grandmother , @entity54 , married @entity55 in 1840			2
the couple ’s son , @entity59 , and their grandson , @entity61 , both ruled as monarchs using the @entity2 surname			0
these close links were considered acceptable until the @entity16 , when @entity30 public opinion struggled to cope with the fact that @entity2 ’s @entity67 was a grandson of @entity0 @entity54 and a cousin of @entity61 in 1917 , @entity61 – the @entity0 ’s grandfather – was forced to change the family ’s name to the more @entity30 - sounding @entity22 after a huge rise in @entity18 feeling			2
@entity2 's @entity67 ( pictured ) was a grandson of @entity0 @entity54 and a cousin of @entity61 the previously unseen papers in the @entity75 , which cover the @entity0 ’s @entity33 speeches from 1952 to 1973 , show she often reads from texts prepared by those who are not part of the @entity80			1
they reveal prime ministers are shown the speech in advance , can make alterations , and have even stopped the queen including topical references to contentious issues			2
in 1973 , @entity23 advised the @entity0 that a reference to the country ’s industrial woes and the three - day week would risk her political neutrality			2
the papers show negotiations went right up to the wire			0
on december 5 , 1973 , sir @entity37 told the prime minister : ‘ it [ the @entity33 broadcast ] has been recorded today , but could be redone if there was anything to which you took strong objection			1
’ however , the @entity0 has on occasion rebelled against these attempts at censorship , and in 1969 refused to record a @entity33 message			0
it was seen as a protest at @entity111 ’s decision to stop her mentioning the country ’s economic woes in her 1968 speech			0
civil servants were particularly nervous about that broadcast because the @entity0 and the @entity117 broke with tradition and decided to write it themselves			0
a @entity121 spokesman said : ‘ @entity33 broadcast is very such @entity0 ’s personal message to the @entity30 and the @entity124			0
a draft is shown to the prime minister as a courtesy and because the @entity0 acts on the advice of her government			1
as with other exchanges between the @entity0 and the @entity126 , we would not comment on the detail or historical events			0

in 1972 prime minister @entity23 told the @entity0 she could refer to the @entity31 only if she stressed her own ties with @entity36
but his private secretary then told him he feared references to her ' continental relations ' would give rise to ' snide remarks '
previously unseen papers cover the @entity0 's speeches from 1952 to 1973
they show how often she reads texts prepared by those who are not part of the @entity80
