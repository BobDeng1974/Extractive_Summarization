obese patients and smokers face an immediate ban on routine operations according to a major @entity5 clinical commissioning group			1
patients in @entity7 will be told today that if they have a body mass index of more than 35 ( morbidly obese ) , they will be required to lose either five per cent of their weight or reduce their @entity10 to under 35 before they undergo surgery			1
smokers will have to have given up eight weeks before any planned operation in a bid to slash heath costs and improve clinical outcomes			1
the @entity17 and @entity18 is one of the largest groups in the country hand as almost 900,000 patients served by 130 gp practices			1
people with a @entity10 of more than 35 , they will be required to lose either five per cent of their weight or reduce their @entity10 to under 35			1
smokers will be forced to prove they have quit for eight weeks before any operation ( file image ) in a statement it said : ' the @entity34 decided that for those patients undergoing hip and knee operations with a body mass index of more than 35 ( morbidly obese ) they patient would be required to have a @entity10 of under 35 or to lose five per cent of their weight before planned surgery , whichever is the lesser weight loss			1
' the new restrictions will be extended to all non-urgent surgical procedures , however , it will not apply to cancer treatment or urgent cases			0
the statement added : ' the @entity34 also confirmed that it would not be restricting ivf treatment or caesarean sections on medical grounds at this time			0
' the quit smoking and the @entity10 requirements will be introduced with immediate effect			2
' patients who have already been given a date for surgery will not be affected by the policy change although they will be offered support in losing weight or quitting smoking			1
dr @entity61 , chair of the @entity62 said : ' all of these temporary measures relate to planned operations and treatments , not those which must be done as an emergency or to save lives			0
' clinicians have carefully reviewed a number of measures , taking into account the impacts of their temporary withdrawal to decide which we will implement			0
' we recognise that each patient is an individual and where their gp or consultant feels that there are exceptional circumstances we will convene a panel of clinicians to consider the case			0
' we will continue to keep people informed about our decisions around the measures			2
' dr @entity61 said that he was being forced to curtail some services because the @entity34 is currently running a deficit of £ 14.5 million			2
the new restrictions imposed by the @entity17 and @entity18 will affect all non-urgent surgical procedures , including hip and knee operations ( file image ) he said he was now going to restrict access to second hearing aids as well as certain expensive drugs			2
he said : ' other measures encourage patients to take steps themselves to reduce their risks from surgery and to improve their outcomes , such as losing weight and stopping smoking			2
' as part of the review we looked at how long a person should stop smoking for before surgery and based on that evidence we have increased the previously discussed time of six weeks to eight weeks			1
' we do n’t under estimate how difficult it will be for some people to lose weight or stop smoking and we will continue to support them			1
if they are able to do this it will also have long term health benefits for them			0
' we are committed to being open about what we are considering and how the decisions are being made			0
we are publishing our decisions and producing information for the patients affected about the available treatment options for them			0
' the @entity34 has a legal duty to live within its financial resources and the prioritisation of services is helping us to do that			0
' it is understood that the @entity34 is expecting a new range of cuts .			0
