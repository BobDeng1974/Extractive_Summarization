despite promising to ‘ do anything to help ’ struggling competitors , he insisted the @entity3 would not ‘ rein in its local news coverage ’			1
giving the @entity33 lecture at the @entity34 on monday he said : ‘ there is what i consider to be a mistaken view that the @entity3 should rein in its local news coverage for fear of aggravating the economic woes facing local newspapers			1
