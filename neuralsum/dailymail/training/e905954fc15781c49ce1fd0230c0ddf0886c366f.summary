judges at the @entity2 war crimes tribunal have controversially overturned the convictions of two @entity5 generals for crimes committed against @entity8 civilians			1
the decision has sparked an outcry in @entity8 where politicans accused the court of ‘ selective justice ’			2
deputy prime minister @entity14 condemned the ruling , saying the tribunal had ‘ lost all its credibility ’ amid warnings the ruling raised questions about the handling of cases in the @entity24 and could bring into the open the thinly concealed animosity between the two @entity28 neighbours			1
controversial : judges have overturned the convictions of @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) for crimes committed against @entity8 civilians			1
the decision has been met with anger in @entity8 ‘ what happened ( in the court ) is a testimony to the selective justice which is worse than any injustice , ’ he declared			2
the decision , by a 3 - 2 majority in the five judge appeals chamber , is one of the most significant reversals in the court ’s 18 - year history and overturns a verdict that dealt a blow to @entity50 ’s self - image as a victim of atrocities , rather than a perpetrator , during the @entity28 wars in the 1990s			1
neither @entity31 nor @entity32 showed any emotion at the decision , but their supporters in the court ’s packed public gallery cheered and clapped as presiding judge @entity61 ordered both men freed immediately			1
@entity31 and @entity32 were sentenced to 24 and 18 years respectively in 2011 for crimes , including murder and deportation			1
judges ruled both men were part of a criminal conspiracy led by former @entity5 president @entity70 to expel @entity71			0
no credibility : deputy prime minister @entity14 condemned the ruling but the appeals judges said prosecutors failed to prove the existence of such as conspiracy , effectively clearing @entity50 ’s entire wartime leadership of war crimes in the operation known as @entity81			1
some 600 @entity71 were killed and more than 200,000 were driven from their homes during the operation when @entity5 forces retook the @entity85 region			0
@entity31 ’s and @entity32 ’s convictions were one of the few at the tribunal set up in 1994 to punish perpetrators of atrocities against @entity8 civilians			1
@entity31 is especially popular among @entity50 nationalists			2
the charismatic former soldier fought in the @entity95 in the 1980s and spent four years on the run from justice before being captured in the @entity98 in december 2005			0
the verdicts against the two generals had triggered anti-western sentiments among nationalist @entity50 ahead of the country ’s planned @entity103 entry in july 2013			0
after the convictions last year , thousands of @entity50 war veterans massed in @entity107 and ripped @entity103 flags and denounced @entity50 ’s leaders who have made @entity103 membership their goal			0
yesterday there was jubilation in the @entity5 capital @entity107 where thousands of people - many dressed as war veterans - burst into applause after the verdict was announced			0
‘ our generals are heroes because they risked their lives to save our country and liberate the people , ’ student @entity119 , 26 , said			0
but in @entity126 , the @entity8 capital , the acquittals enraged hard line opponents of the @entity129 court in who accuse its judges of @entity134 bias - a kangaroo court , they say , whose main aim was to vilify and convict @entity71			0
@entity8 president @entity137 said : ‘ it is now quite clear the tribunal has made a political decision and not a legal ruling			2
the ruling will not contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region and will open old wounds			0
