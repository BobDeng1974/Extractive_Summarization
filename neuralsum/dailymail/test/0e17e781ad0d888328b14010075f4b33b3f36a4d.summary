a tiny @entity1 hamlet named @entity2 is bracing itself for the world 's next gold rush - after prospectors found evidence that it sits on major deposits			1
the remote community in @entity9 does not even have a shop but local streams have been well known for grains of gold of ' significant size ' for decades			1
@entity2 has been ignored by investors in favour of the oil industry but a two - year investigation has revealed the possible existence of gold deposits worth millions			1
a significant deposit is believed by scientists to lie somewhere near @entity23 which shares its name with the popular @entity26 reality tv show @entity2 , population 300 , has a single road , a few houses , primary school , church , graveyard and a community hall @entity36 mining giant @entity34 and a @entity38 firm @entity37 are now seeking planning permission for further investigation			1
@entity37 managing director @entity41 , 31 , said : ' this area in @entity9 has all the right hallmarks of a major deposit to be hiding underneath the surface			1
' we looked at the geology and found some really exciting rocks with potential for a large deposit			1
' over two years we have found that the whole of @entity9 is a ripe area for gold mineralisation			1
we 're just trying to locate where the gold deposit is			1
' he added : ' a 3.5million ounce gold deposit is currently being developed by @entity58 in @entity59			1
we hope to repeat this success			0
' @entity2 , population 300 , has a single road , a few houses , primary school , church , graveyard and a community hall			2
@entity58 was discovered by @entity68 in nearby @entity69 in the 1990s and has long been spotted in local streams			0
gold was discovered by @entity68 in nearby @entity69 in the 1990s and it has long been spotted in local streams @entity71 has been working on the site for the last two years and more recently received backing from @entity34 , controlled by @entity36 businessman @entity73			1
they have carried out test drills with more planned , pending pemission			0
mr. @entity41 said the the development of a gold mine was at a very early stage but claimed the area had ' enormous potential '			2
panning for gold : local streams have been well known for grains of gold of ' significant size ' for decades he added : ' we 're testing the rock and soil to sample whether it has the potential for gold beneath it			1
' we 're trying to locate where this deposit will be and we will jump those hurdles when we get there			2
' the only way we will know for sure is when we start drilling which we hope to be doing next year			0
' initially we will cover the area with stream sediment sampling - the old - school way			0
' then from the streams with high gold content , we will crack open any rocks we think have the potential of hosting gold			2
' the mineral sector has neglected for too long in @entity1 because we 're so rich with oil and gas but we do n't have to be so reliant on that because we 're also rich with mineral deposits			0
' locals said the prospect of finding gold was ' exciting '			2
@entity115 , local councillor for @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , said : ' having gold in the area is a very exciting prospect , but it is something that will require a great deal of thought and consultation			2
' i 'm only just beginning to wrap my head around it			0
' at the moment i 'm neither jumping up and down or have my head in my hands in dismay			0
i think we need a lot more information			0
' resident @entity134 , 79 , said : ' we lack population so it could be good for the area			0
with these kinds of things some people will like it , and some people wo n't			0
' @entity9 declined to comment before the submission of planning applications and said they would ' wait to see if it comes about ' @entity23 resident and full - time mum @entity147 added : ' if it brings jobs to the community then i am all for it - but only as long as it does n't affect the farming community because that is what the area is about			0
' @entity37 already has a licence from the @entity160 to search for gold in the undulating hills between @entity69 and @entity116			1
@entity9 declined to comment before the submission of planning applications and said they would ' wait to see if it comes about ' .			0

' significant ' ore deposit could herald the beginning of *highland* gold rush
@entity36 mining giant and @entity173 's @entity37 look to make further *exploration*
small community *cautiously* *optimistic* about find but wants to know more
