by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 06:59 est , 11 september 2012 as the search for signs of life on @entity5 gathers pace , scientists may soon be able to turn their focus on a whole new group of planets			2
for they have found that there are in fact many more habitable planets in the universe than previously thought			0
the traditional starting point for calculating the chances of finding extra-terrestrial life starts with finding planets with liquid water on the surface			2
planets ( or moons ) which meet this criteria live in the so - called ' @entity23 ' , where planets are just the right distance from their sun ( " not too hot , not too cold " ) for water to exist			0
but new computer models , presented at this week 's @entity29 , allow scientists to identify planets with underground water , which is kept liquid by planetary heat			2
the traditional view : scientists look for surface water as a key indicator a planet is hospitable to life , like in this artist 's impression - but underground water can also sustain life these planets , they say , could be habitable			1
@entity45 , a phd student from @entity46 , who worked on creating the model , said : ' it 's the idea of a range of distances from a star within which the surface of an @entity54 - like planet is not too hot or too cold for water to be liquid			1
' so traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this @entity23 - not too hot and not too cold - then it can have liquid water on its surface and be a habitable planet ' prof @entity63 , also from @entity46 , said : ' there is a significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the @entity54 , extending down several kilometres			1
' and some workers believe that the bulk of life on @entity54 could even reside in this deep biosphere			0
' going underground : recent research shows how much life exists within our own planet 's interior the @entity77 reports that the team are now developing models to predict which planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water - in turn raising the possibility of alien life			1
mr @entity45 added : ' if you take into account the possibility of deep biospheres , then you have a problem reconciling that with the idea of a narrow habitable zone defined only by conditions at the surface			0
' the team said that even if a planet so far from its sun that that it received almost no solar heat , it could still maintain underground liquid water .			0

@entity46 scientists develop models to predict which planets might have water trapped below the surface
*astronomers* normally look for surface water as a sign a planet is capable of sustaining life
