by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:25 est , 18 november 2013 a single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed , scientists say			1
they hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease by showing early on whether patients face a deadly threat or can afford to wait and see how their condition progresses			1
much higher levels of the protein , @entity16 , were found in prostate tumour tissue than in healthy tissue			1
but the difference was especially marked in aggressive cancers and those already advancing around the body			2
breakthrough : a single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed			1
scientists hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease studies of two independent patient groups confirmed that the protein can be used both to diagnose prostate cancer , and to single out those which need immediate hard - hitting treatment in the form of surgery , chemotherapy or radiotherapy			2
patients with low levels of the protein were more likely to qualify for ‘ watchful waiting ’ monitoring , which simply involves keeping a close eye on how the disease progresses			1
older men with very mild forms of prostate cancer are likely to die from other causes before even showing symptoms of the disease , making treatment unnecessary			2
aggressive and tame forms of prostate cancer are popularly known as ‘ tigers ’ and ‘ pussycats ’ respectively			0
currently , they are loosely identified by the @entity56 score , an aggressiveness rating of one to 10 given to a cancer after a biopsy that involves the removal of prostate tissue			1
‘ @entity63 ’ are defined by a @entity56 score of eight and above			0
with the new test , much higher levels of the protein , @entity16 , were found in prostate tumour tissue than in healthy tissue @entity16 causes prostate cancer cells to behave in an aggressive tiger - like fashion , making them more likely to break out and invade healthy tissue , said the scientists			1
while a ‘ tiger ’ patient ’s survival may depend on radical treatment , both surgery and radiotherapy can have serious after - effects , causing lifelong problems such as impotency and urinary incontinence			0
lead scientist dr @entity84 , from @entity85 , said : ‘ this is early research , but if clinical trials confirm our results then it could help clinicians to tell which patients have a more aggressive tumour and need proportionally aggressive treatment , while sparing patients with low grade tumours unnecessary radiotherapy or surgery			1
‘ this is an important step along the path to developing a much - sought after test that could distinguish between different types of prostate cancer			0
’ each year around 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the @entity105 and around 11,000 die from the disease			0
professor @entity107 , a prostate cancer expert from @entity109 , which funded the research , said : ‘ as a prostate cancer clinician , i have been waiting for years for a test that can define the aggressive disease			0
‘ i hope that this research brings forward the day when i can say to patients : “ we know that your cancer does n’t need treatment ” - a crucial development that could spare thousands of patients from enduring arduous treatment with unpleasant side effects			2
‘ this extremely interesting study provides an important development for prostate cancer screening , and potentially even reveals a new target for the development of new prostate cancer drugs in the future			0
’ the study , conducted in collaboration with the @entity131 in @entity132 , is published in the journal @entity134 .			0

there are higher levels of the protein @entity16 in aggressive tumours
finding means *doctors* can identify those tumours that are likely to pose a deadly threat and which need to be *tackled* with *intensive* treatment
currently the aggressiveness of a tumour can only be loosely identified meaning some patients have *debilitating* treatment that is not necessary
