tens of thousands of employees at @entity2 and @entity3 will receive compensation from a £ 40 million pot after an error with holiday pay was discovered			1
the @entity8 said 69,000 of its ' partners ' were receiving the additional sums in this month 's wages - representing an average £ 580 per employee - after the miscalculations dating back to 2006			1
the employee - owned retailer said the mistake was spotted during a review earlier this year			0
an employee had also pointed out the error at around the same time			0
payout : tens of thousands of employees at @entity2 and @entity3 will receive compensation from a £ 40 million pot after an error with holiday pay was discovered today 's announcement relates to the majority of the 85,500 partners who work at @entity2 department stores and the group 's supermarket arm @entity3			1
most of those affected work on shop floors , call centres or in distribution warehouses			1
the business said individual payments would vary according to pay and shift patterns , with more than half of recipients being given less than £ 120 , but some receiving a few thousand pounds			0
those who have left through redundancy , illness or retirement will also be contacted by the group , it said			0
but workers who voluntarily left the company may feel aggrieved after the company decided it would not compensate them even if they had been employed by @entity8 until recently			1
the problem related to employment legislation , which means that when calculating holiday pay , sums ought to be based on an average weekly wage including any premiums such as extra cash for sundays or bank holidays - rather than just on normal hours			2
compensation : the @entity8 said 69,000 of its ' partners ' were receiving the additional sums in this month 's wages - representing an average £ 580 per employee the group said that after the review it became clear that some partners had not been paid correctly			1
the @entity8 said the one - off cost would be reported in half - year results in september , although it would not be deducted from this year 's partnership bonus pool			2
future pensions liabilities are expected to rise by £ 7 million as a result , while pay systems have been updated to ensure all future holiday payments are correct - adding around 0.5 per cent to annual pay costs			0
@entity74 , director of personnel , said : ' as soon as we established that we were not implementing the @entity76 correctly , we worked quickly to make the repayments to our partners in a way that is both fair and responsible			0
' the regulations go back to 1998 , but @entity2 decided to cut off the start of the compensation period at april 2006 when its accurate digital records began			2
sources at the group believe its effort to address the discrepancy ' goes beyond what other companies would do '			0
the @entity8 operates 39 @entity2 stores across the @entity92 as well as 295 @entity3 shops and has annual gross sales of more than £ 9.5 billion			1
its payment blunder is a particular embarrassment because its structure of employee ownership is often held up as an example by politicians of how to run a business .			0

works out at average £ 580 per employee after mistakes dating back to 2006
