' @entity1 ' sterling silver bottle cooler what on earth is a carbon fibre and sterling silver @entity7 bottle cooler , i hear you cry ? it 's a wine bucket to you and me - a £ 17,750 one ! so what exactly justifies such a large price tag for something a lot of us have made redundant in favour of a fridge ? the lining is reminiscent of a car tyre , and it 's made by hand at silversmiths @entity23 as part of a silverwear collection , silver by @entity21			1
it is just one of 77 made			2
bearing all of this in mind , £ 17,750 is still a hefty amount to spend on a decent car , let alone a wine bucket			1
though we have a sneaking suspicion that this may be different in the world of @entity21			0
after all this is n't the first bumper price household object that has received the @entity21 treatment			0
last year the motoring manufacture launched a whole range of products to be sold in @entity45 's famous department store , @entity44			1
products included the £ 2,000 @entity21 pram in partnership between the luxury @entity48 , another @entity50 brand which first began designing carriages for babies in 1877			2
@entity21 touches included the @entity54 lined seat pad - a high quality and expensive suede manufactured in @entity58 - to the super soft leather - trimmed handle and bumper bar			0
the @entity21 pram is sold for £ 2,000 with only 800 models made the design of the aluminium alloy wheels is based on the @entity66 , which retails for £ 1.2 million			2
and once again you were buying exclusivity with only 800 being sold in @entity44			1
so what 's next ? an @entity21 foot spa ? an @entity21 dish washer ? the possibilities are endless especially if you consider the fact that products such as the as the @entity21 espresso cup and the @entity76 are some of the current design options at silver by @entity21			0
the @entity21 seven piece dining set by @entity23 retails at £ 5,440 @entity23 , co-creator of @entity79 by @entity21 , told @entity81 that out of all the pieces he 'd helped to create the bottle cooler was the one he was most proud of			1
' the ice bucket i created for them is one of my favourite designs			2
i wanted to make a shape nobody else had ever seen and incorporate carbon fibre , which is a material used in @entity21 cars			0
the bucket takes 60 hours of silversmithing to create and 10 hours to polish			0
some of the cheaper pieces include the £ 140 @entity94 by @entity23 for @entity21 ' i think the @entity21 brand will give us a great future			0
it 's their 100th anniversary next year so i 'm sure we 'll be involved in lots of exciting projects			0
' if your price range does n't quite stretch to the wine cooler the @entity106 plate is the cheapest in the collection coming in at a snip of £ 60			1
however , if you 're feeling a little more extravagant you could go for the wine cooler 's 24 carat gold plated sister at a cool £ 22,750 .			1

@entity113 cooler *selling* for £ 17,750 in the famous department store , @entity44
