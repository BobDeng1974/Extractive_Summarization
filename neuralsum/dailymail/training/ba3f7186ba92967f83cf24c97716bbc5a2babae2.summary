by @entity0 published : 16:35 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 05:01 est , 28 february 2014 low - carbohydrate diets are all the rage , but one nutrition expert has claimed that they may not be as healthy as we think			0
according to dr t @entity9 's new book @entity7 , giving up grains can mean putting yourself at a higher risk for heart disease , cancer and other regenerative diseases			1
he says that not only are low - carb diets lacking in nutritional value , but they 're actually even worse than the standard @entity20 diet			2
unhealthy diet craze ? according to dr t @entity9 's new book @entity7 , trendy low - carb diets can put you at a higher risk for heart disease , cancer and other regenerative diseases the problem , says dr @entity9 , who has 40 years ' experience in nutrition science , is that people who cut out carbs tend to load up on animal protein and fat , which heightens cholesterol levels , sometimes leading to disease			1
even the standard @entity20 diet is too high in protein and fat , an imbalance that is merely worsened with a low - carb diet			2
consuming more meat also leads to smaller consequences like headaches , rash , cramps and bad breath , also known as halitosis			0
many low - carb diets require that you only consume 15 to 20per cent of your total calories from carbs , which often eliminates nutritionally rich plant - based and complex carbohydrate foods that prevent diseases and promote health			1
while the author admits that following a low - carb diet can lead to quick weight loss - which is likely the reason it is so trendy - he adds that in the long run , it can lead to dire consequences			2
' low - carb , high - protein , high - fat diets cause high cholesterol - a major indicator of heart disease and cancer risks , ' he told @entity70			0
bad balance : the problem , says dr @entity9 , is that people who cut out carbs tend to load up on animal protein and fat , which heightens cholesterol levels , sometimes leading to disease the latest trend in this category is the @entity82 diet , also known as the @entity84 diet - which , as dr @entity9 points out , is merely a ' slightly tweaked ' version of other previous fads including @entity86 , the @entity87 and @entity88			1
not only does the @entity82 diet cut out complex carbs that are good for you , but it also promotes the consumption of meat , something cavemen did n't even have easy access to , he explains			0
instead of following a fad diet with no scientifically proven health benefits , dr @entity9 recommends the @entity99 , plant - based diet , or @entity101 , which involves eating mostly intact vegetables , fruits and grains and limiting refined carbs and salt			1
he also suggest restricting your intake of added oils and fats , claiming that following these guidelines can rid you of autoimmune diseases and type 2 diabetes and even slow down the effects of cancer			0
' the only redeeming factor of low - carb diets could be their removal of high - carbohydrate products like cookies , cakes , and soft drinks , ' he conceded			0
' but that 's only true if it 's emphasized that refined carbs , not all carbs , are the problem			1

instead of following a fad diet with no scientifically proven health benefits , dr t @entity9 recommends the @entity99 , plant - based diet , which *consists* of intact vegetables , fruits and grains limited refined carbs
