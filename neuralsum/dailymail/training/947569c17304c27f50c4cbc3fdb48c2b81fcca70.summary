by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 13:03 est , 16 october 2013 a seriously - wounded @entity1 who was thought to be unconscious has shown an astonishing act of defiance by saluting his senior as he was presented with the @entity5 in hospital			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , has been hailed an inspiration after his wife uploaded an image to @entity13 showing him raising his arm to show respect for the higher - ranking officer			1
the touching moment - which his commander called the single greatest event he has witnessed in his 10 years in the @entity20 - came after @entity7 underwent surgery in a military hospital in @entity23			1
he had suffered serious leg injuries after a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives in @entity27 last week , killing four of @entity7 ' comrades			1
he was on his fourth tour of @entity23			2
honourable : army ranger @entity31 courageously brought his right hand up to salute during a @entity5 ceremony at his bedside in intensive care			1
his comrades thought he was unconscious days later as he lay motionless in his hospital bed in intensive care , a simple military ceremony was conducted to honour him with a @entity5 , an award for his sacrifice to his country			1
but to everyone 's complete surprise @entity7 , who was thought to still be unconscious after the extensive surgery , raised his right hand to salute his commander			1
he battled a neck brace , breathing apparatus and tubes and even competed with a doctor who tried to stop him from moving to complete the mark of respect			2
the brave and magnanimous gesture brought tears to the eyes of the 50 grown men and soldiers who had gathered in the room to witness the ceremony			1
inspiration : @entity31 's wife @entity60 has shared the picture as it was the commander 's hope that newspapers and new channels would publish it to show how he is an inspiration to the nation the simple gesture left a lasting poignant memory for the senior officer , who wanted to share the story of @entity31 's honour and bravery with the world			1
a letter from his commmander to his wife , @entity76 , explained the gravitas of the occasion			0
' i can not impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day , ' he wrote in the letter , which she shared on @entity13			2
' grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about @entity31 's courage and character			2
' the commander wrote that he believes the picture , which he has hanging above his desk , belongs on every news channel and newspaper , adding he ' will remember it as the single greatest event i have witnessed in my ten years in the @entity20 '			0
suicide bomb : @entity31 was seriously injured in @entity23 , pictured , when a suicide bomber detonated , killing his comrades the ceremony was held just prior to mr @entity7 being flown back to @entity103 , @entity104 , via @entity105 , to receive further treatment			1
his mother , @entity107 , speaking to @entity108 , said her son ' sounded amazing ' when he talked with @entity110			0
' he was in good spirits , ' she said			0
she told the news service her 24 - year - old @entity114 graduate has faced an uphill struggle to join the @entity20 , because of a skiing accident which left him with a broken femur years ago			0
but he never gave up hope			0
she said : ' he was just very determined			0
he wanted so bad to be a ranger			0
after three or four times , he wrote to the @entity121 and got accepted from the surgeon general			0
' she told @entity124 that they @entity125 asked him to join up right after boot camp : ' it was a great honor			0
' @entity31 was seriously wounded as you know and survived for almost two hours after his injury before arriving to the hospital			2
@entity31 was immediately pushed through a series of surgeries and emerged hours later into an intensive care unit here at our base in @entity23			1
despite being in intense pain and mental duress , @entity31 remained alert and compassionate to the limited @entity125 that were allowed to visit him bedside			2
prior to @entity31 being moved to @entity105 for his eventual flight to @entity104 , we conducted a ceremony to award him with the @entity5 for wounds received in action			1
a simple ceremony , you can picture a room full of @entity125 , leaders , doctors , and nurses surrounding his bedside while the @entity152 regimental commander pinned the @entity5 to his blanket			1
during the presentation the commander publishes the official orders verbally and leaned over @entity31 to thank him for his sacrifice			2
@entity31 , whom everybody in the room ( over 50 people ) assumed to be unconscious , began to move his right arm under the blanket in a diligent effort to salute the commander as is customary during these ceremonies			1
despite his wounds , wrappings , tubes , and pain , @entity31 fought the doctor who was trying to restrain his right arm and rendered the most beautiful salute any person in that room had ever see			0
i can not impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day			0
grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about @entity31 's courage and character			0
the picture , which we believe belongs on every news channel and every news paper is attached			0
i have it hanging above my desk now and will remember it as the single greatest event i have witnessed in my ten years in the @entity20 .			0
