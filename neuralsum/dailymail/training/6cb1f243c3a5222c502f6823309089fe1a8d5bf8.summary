by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 02:06 est , 24 june 2013 awkward question : shadow chancellor @entity3 confirmed that he is prepared to borrow more money for more public spending @entity6 is prepared to borrow yet more money to pay for increased public spending on infrastructure projects , @entity3 insisted yesterday			1
the @entity3 said it would be ‘ economically very foolish ’ to rule out increasing borrowing to fund roadbuilding and other projects			1
his intervention came after @entity6 leader @entity15 used a weekend speech to try to boost his party ’s credibility on the economy , admitting it would not be able to reverse any of the government ’s spending cuts unless savings could be made elsewhere			2
chancellor @entity24 will use wednesday ’s spending review to set out plans to invest an extra £ 15 billion in capital spending over the course of the next @entity29			1
unusually , @entity30 chief secretary to the treasury @entity31 will make a further statement to the @entity33 the following day setting out details of infrastructure spending , with dozens of road projects expected to get the go - ahead			2
mr @entity3 confirmed yesterday that @entity6 would stick , for the first year of a government at least , to the coalition ’s day - to - day spending plans			1
on ‘ day to day spending , we ’re saying we ’ll have to make changes within their plans ; we ’re not going to be spending more , ’ the shadow @entity3 said			1
but he went on : ‘ on capital spending , we ’re saying this year and next year , the chancellor should be investing to get the economy growing			2
@entity49 to head : shadow chancellor @entity3 , left , with chancellor @entity24 argued today about how they would rescue the @entity52 economy , although @entity6 has been forced to adopt some of the coalition 's plans ‘ i ’m not going to say to you today two years ahead what our judgement will be			1
we ’ll wait till nearer the time			0
but do i think there is a case , could be a case in two years ’ time for still investing in roads and our infrastructure to get the economy moving and the deficit down ? yes			0
‘ the reason is because if the economy is still weak then , living standards are still falling , if youth unemployment is still high and if there ’s still a case on our long - term infrastructure to get things moving with interest rates low , of course there ’s a case for doing that			0
it would be economically very foolish to deny that			0
’ the @entity82 seized on mr balls ’ remarks as evidence that mr @entity15 ’s claim his party would show ‘ discipline ’ was meaningless			2
sparring match : mr @entity3 said on the @entity90 that if he became chancellor he would consider borrowing more for major infrastructure building immediately economic secretary to the treasury @entity93 said : ‘ @entity15 ’s spending “ discipline ” has barely lasted five minutes as @entity3 admits @entity6 would still spend more and borrow more			1
that ’s the same old @entity6 approach that got us into this mess in the first place			0
‘ hardworking people would pay the price with higher interest rates and higher bills			0
’ mr @entity24 insisted yesterday that while the economy now appeared to be ‘ out of intensive care ’ , it could slide back into crisis if the government abandons its austerity programme			1
the chancellor told the @entity112 ’s @entity90 show that the budget deficit was still too high and he was committed to finding further savings in @entity116 spending worth £ 11.5 billion			1
‘ there certainly is a chance of a relapse if we abandon our economic plan , ’ he said , arguing that instead of ‘ learning the lessons of what went wrong on their watch ’ @entity6 was making it clear ‘ they would still borrow more ’			2
accusations : @entity3 maintained that if mr @entity24 had borrowed more money to spend on building ' we would n't have had such a flat - lining economy ' ‘ i think we are moving from rescue to recovery , and you can see that because the economy ’s growing , unemployment is coming down , there ’s a record number of people in work			1
‘ now it ’s still going to be of course a challenge because the economic problems that @entity52 built up over many years are considerable and you can see what ’s happening elsewhere in the world , but i think we are out of intensive care and our job now is to secure the recovery			0
‘ i think if @entity52 suddenly said we do n’t have the confidence to deal with our debts , we ’re not prepared to confront our problems as a nation , then we would go back into intensive care			0
and that ’s what this week is all about			0
it ’s about making clear that we are going to secure that recovery			0
‘ we ’re going to go on taking the difficult decisions , go on cutting back spending , go on prioritising spending on the things that help the economy and cutting the spending that does n’t			0

@entity24 will detail his @entity116 budget savings next week
mr @entity3 said he would stick to those spending plans for at least a year
but mr @entity3 also said he would borrow more for increased public spending
