by @entity1 reporter published : 20:37 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 23:12 est , 23 august 2012 scientists discovered that ink diluted with bacteria - tainted water is to blame for more than four dozen cases involving infected tattoos that have been reported in at least four states			1
according to researchers , the largest cluster of cases was in @entity11 , @entity12 , where 19 people ended up with bubbly rashes on their new tattoos which they got from the same artist			1
the investigation into the outbreak started last fall when a 19 - year - old man from @entity20 got a stubborn rash that would not go away			0
nasty bug : a common bacteria fond in distilled water can cause itchy and painful pus - filled blisters that can take months to clear up tests showed that the infection was caused by a distant bacterial relative of tuberculosis called @entity30			1
while not life - threatening , the bacteria can cause itchy and painful pus - filled blisters that can take four months or longer to clear up , and involve treatment with harsh antibiotics with unpleasant side effects			1
in some cases , it is necessary to remove the entire area of the skin affected by the bacteria , which could leave a large scar			0
infections from body art are nothing new			0
hepatitis , staph infections and even the superbug known as @entity46 have been tied to tattoos			0
dirty needles and unsanitary conditions are often to blame			0
culprit : bacteria called @entity30 was detected in non-sterile water used to dilute tattoo ink source of outbreak : a tattoo artist from @entity20 said he bought the ink linked to the infection at a large trade show in @entity60 but in all the @entity12 cases , the tattoo artist wore disposable gloves and sterilized his instruments			1
the problem , investigators concluded , was in the ink , which the @entity11 artist bought at large trade show in @entity60 , according to @entity69			2
‘ even if you get a tattoo from a facility that does everything right , it 's not risk free , ’ said dr @entity70 , deputy director of the health department in @entity12 's @entity72			2
he is lead author of a report on last fall 's @entity11 cases was released by the @entity80 on wednesday			2
in the past year , there have been 22 confirmed cases and more than 30 suspected cases of the skin infection in @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity12 and @entity84 , health officials said			2
the infections were tied to ink or non-sterile water used to dilute the ink , according to health officials			1
outbreak : the largest cluster of tattoo infections was found in @entity11 , @entity12 , where 19 people who went to the same artist caught the bug scattered reports of the illness in tattoo customers have been reported over the past 10 years			1
but they may be growing more common as more people get tattoos , experts said			0
an estimated 21 per cent of @entity107 adults have at least one tattoo , according to polls			0
the bacteria are common in tap water , and have been seen in the past when tattoo artists used contaminated water to lighten dark ink			1
the ink used in @entity12 was ‘ gray wash , ’ which can make a tattoo resemble a photograph			1
the ink was since recalled and has not returned to the market			0
makers of ' gray wash ' ink sometimes use distilled water to lighten the ink , thinking it 's clean of infection - causing contaminants			0
but the bacteria can live in that too , said @entity132 , who led a related investigation by the @entity134			0
her study appears in @entity134 's @entity136 released on wednesday			0
special effect : the ink used in @entity11 was ' gray wash , ' which can make a tattoo resemble a photograph complications : it takes a cocktail of antibiotics to treat the infection caused by the mycobacterium chelonae bacteria , and sometimes it even requires removing skin some ink manufacturers add witch hazel or an alcohol preservative to lower risk of certain viruses , but the hardy chelonae bacteria are resistant to disinfectants , she added			1
investigators found the bacteria in opened and unopened bottles of ink at the @entity12 tattoo parlor			1
they did not find it in water at the shop , meaning that the artist was not the one who diluted the ink , @entity132 said			0
health officials say tattoo customers should ask what kind of ink is being used and what measures are in place to prevent infections .			2
