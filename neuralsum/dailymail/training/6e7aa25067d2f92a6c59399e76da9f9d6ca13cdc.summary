there were many times on monday , during @entity3 ’s straight - sets victory over @entity4 when it was easy to forget she was playing in only her sixth @entity7 main draw			1
the world no 13 , from @entity9 , is just 20 and won the @entity11 girls ’ title as recently as 2012 , yet she is now just one win from reaching her third consecutive @entity7 semi-final			1
she dispatched @entity4 , who knocked out @entity17 in the third round , with the same charming efficiency as she treated post-match questions about her family ’s obsession with royalty			1
the ‘ temple of tennis ’ , she called it , noting dryly that she ‘ follows the roof on @entity39 , so i hope he was proud of me ’			2
there was also sporting royalty looking on in the shape of sir @entity47 , although @entity3 — and particularly her mother , who called her twin daughters @entity31 and @entity50 and her son @entity51 — might have preferred the other ‘ @entity52 ’ , @entity53			2
‘ first off , i should say it ’s a parental interest in royalty , ’ said @entity3 , smiling , ‘ probably mostly my mother			2
she named us , so i was n’t really aware of what was going on at that time			0
she ’s kind of a closet royalist			0
‘ i can be a princess , though			0
i can be moody in the morning and my fitness trainer carries my tennis bag around			0
‘ but that ’s so i do n’t get tired because i want to save all my energy for the match			0
i can demand a few things once in a while but i do it with love			0
’ eyes on the prize : @entity3 stretches to reach a ball during her victory over @entity4 fans favourtie : the @entity11 crowd showed their support for @entity3 on monday @entity3 may admit she is prone to the occasional princess - like moment , but the only thing precious about her display yesterday was her talent			1
she would obviously have preferred to face @entity4 over @entity17 , but the @entity81 , ranked no 24 in the world , was still a testing , experienced opponent			1
@entity86 chairman @entity85 inexplicably appeared to snooze off towards the end , but this was a close , high - quality encounter with plenty of entertaining tennis			2
@entity4 was playing in her 34th @entity7 and , at the age of 24 , is a veteran of two @entity94			1
she chased , harried , shrieked , played some exquisite drop shots and enjoyed success at the net as she tried to rush @entity98 , but the @entity9 kept her cool and responded by moving up a gear when it mattered			0
her flat , hard groundstrokes were erratic at times , particularly on the forehand side or when trying to take the ball out of the air , but she rarely panicked and showed maturity far beyond her tender years			0
not this time : @entity4 could n't pull off another surprise win over @entity3 having beaten @entity17 previously not impressed ? sir @entity47 appeared to be falling asleep during @entity3 's victory @entity3 said she was a ‘ bit of a nerd ’ , enjoyed maths at school and had @entity111 , star of tv show @entity113 , watching from the players ’ box			1
there is certainly a calculated , almost unemotional approach to her play			0
fans known as @entity123 ’s @entity122 have thrown cuddly toys on to court at previous @entity7 but there is nothing soft about @entity3 ’s on - court demeanour			1
her steely resilience means she has far more in common with her idol @entity130 than just blonde hair and @entity133 looks			2
a 20 - minute delay with @entity4 leading 3 - 2 on serve in the first set , @entity3 ’s first experience under the @entity29 roof and a 4 - 1 deficit to overcome in the first - set tiebreak were simply obstacles for her to scale			1
she had to come from behind in the second set , too , slipping 4 - 2 behind and then pushing an ill - advised forehand volley horribly wide to give @entity4 a sniff of a second break at 30 - 30 in the seventh game			1
plenty to ponder : @entity85 looked like he had a lot on his mind as he sat in the @entity34 at @entity11 @entity3 clung on , however , forcing @entity4 to serve for the set at 5 - 4 , and then pounced on a second serve , breaking back at the second time of asking			1
from then she did not look back , racing through the three remaining games in classy style to wrap up the match in 1hr 46min			0
@entity3 said : ‘ i believe in myself			2
every match i play , i believe i can win			2
i ’ve proved to myself i can play on the big stage and i ’m proud of the way i handle it out there			0
i think i was able to step up on the important moments			0
‘ i ’ve been in situations like that before , so i had full belief in myself that i was n’t out of it			0
‘ this is what i ’ve worked so hard for — to be in the quarter - finals of @entity11 — but i do n’t want to stop here			1
’ @entity3 next plays the winner of @entity130 vs @entity168 , who could not start their match on @entity171 last night			1
if one of that pair reaches the semi-finals , they will have to play three games in as many days .			0

@entity3 won 7 - 6 , 7 - 5 and will now face @entity130 or @entity168 in @entity11 last eight
@entity3 one win from making third consecutive @entity7 semi-final
@entity3 won @entity11 in 2012
@entity4 had knocked out @entity183 1 @entity17 in last round
