by @entity0 published : 16:51 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 3 august 2013 no one expects to park their car free of charge next to the airport terminal building while they fly abroad on holiday			1
but then neither do they expect to be charged simply for dropping off or picking up friends and family at the airport — let alone fined if they take too long			0
yet that is exactly what @entity14 and many other @entity16 airports now do			1
since @entity19 first introduced drop - off charges in 2007 , they have been quietly — some would say sneakily — introduced by nine other regional airports			1
entry barrier ticket machines , coupled with high - tech number - plate recognition cameras , monitor your arrival and departure			2
drive up to @entity14 ’s drop - off point and you will be charged £ 2			1
leave your car unattended while you help your passengers find their way to the right check - in desk , or exceed the maximum 15 minutes waiting time , and you will be hit with an £ 80 penalty			1
@entity35 - high : the car park at @entity37 , where it costs £ 163.90 to park your car for eight days snowed under : car parking rates may put many holidaymakers off using a particular airport ( @entity14 pictured ) and the same applies if you stop , even for a few seconds , on any of the airport ’s approach roads.this week , councils have been widely condemned for the excessive charges they impose on motorists for on - street parking			1
between them , they made profits of £ 565 million in parking charges and fines			2
in fact , it is illegal for councils to use parking as a source of revenue			0
but when it comes to predatory airport parking companies , there is no legislation to protect motorists from extreme charges			0
airports can charge whatever they like			0
alongside the excessive drop - off charges and ‘ fines ’ for anyone who , unfamiliar with the road layouts , stops momentarily to read a sign , or adjust a rear - view mirror , airports have jacked up their long - term parking charges			1
it now costs £ 163.90 to park a car at @entity37 for eight days and £ 302.50 for 15 days			1
@entity79 charges £ 171 for two weeks ’ parking and @entity81 £ 160			2
and , unlike @entity37 , where you can still drop off someone for nothing , @entity81 charges £ 2.50 just to stop briefly and let out a passenger			1
airports try to distance themselves from blame by saying parking and traffic management are contracted out to specialist firms			0
what ’s more , many of these firms are foreign - owned			2
ridiculous : a parked plane gets a better deal than a parked car these days at airports money - maker : cars parked at @entity101 car park for example , overstay at @entity14 and you will receive a ‘ parking charge notice ’ from a @entity105 - based company called @entity106 , which also manages car parking at @entity37 , @entity101 , @entity79 , @entity108 and @entity110 airports , and runs the traffic management at @entity19			1
@entity114 and @entity115 airports contract out parking to a @entity118 company called @entity119			0
both firms collect money from motorists via what they call ‘ @entity124 ’ — named , presumably , to ape official , police - issued ‘ @entity125 ’			2
these dress the fees up as fines , but they are not legally fines			0
in truth , parking on private land is governed by contract law , and in order to collect the money , the parking company would have to take out a civil action in court			0
some motorists have rumbled this and refuse to pay , resulting in some parking companies dropping the charge — presumably for fear that the courts would rule that their parking charges represent an unfair contract			0
but most motorists simply pay up			0
in for a penny in for a pound : @entity19 car parking is very much seen as a rip - off and now has to be factored in when working out holiday costs i approached several airports to ask how much revenue they generated from parking			1
most refused to say , citing ‘ commercial sensitivity ’			0
but @entity160 , the largest @entity16 - owned airports operator in the country , said that in the year to march 2013 it earned £ 59 million from parking fees at @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity81 airports			1
that is 14.3 per cent of total revenues , and £ 7 million more than it earned from parking the year before			2
despite claims that increased charges are designed to encourage use of public transport and to reduce traffic congestion , squeezing cash from motorists is a lucrative source of income			0
in many cases , airports must be extracting more money from passengers parking their cars than from them as air passengers			0
@entity186 , for example , is advertising flights from @entity101 to @entity188 or @entity189 for £ 52 return			2
but parking your car in the long - term car park for a week at @entity101 will cost exactly twice this : £ 104			1
at some airports it now costs more to park a car than a plane			1
@entity163 , which charges £ 35 per day in its short - term car park , charges only £ 21 for a six - seater light aircraft to be parked on the runway apron for the same period			1
even an @entity202 gets four hours ’ free parking on the apron at @entity163			0
not so motorists , who must pay £ 2.80 to park their car for a mere half an hour			1
@entity208 , of the @entity202 , says : ‘ where airports see a motorist , they see a pound sign			0
‘ it is not unreasonable to want to move passengers along quickly and so to cut congestion , but airports could do that by employing marshals to move motorists along , not by penalising them with high charges			0
’ he adds that concessions should also be made for cars dropping off disabled @entity223 airports have even used the threat of terrorism as an excuse for charging drivers who drop off passengers			2
a spokesman for @entity115 , which charges £ 1 to enter its drop - off zone , said the area had to be redesigned after the terrorist attack on @entity233 in 2007			1
but @entity81 , which charges £ 2.50 for cars that drop off a passenger , admits that ‘ the prime rationale for the charge is commercial ’ and has been driven by the fact that passenger numbers have fallen during the recession			2
crazy money : parking a car for a fortnight is more expensive than parking up a plane when @entity114 introduced a £ 2 charge for vehicles to enter its drop - off zone last year , its then owners , the @entity118 group @entity245 , claimed the charge was part of an ‘ environmentally friendly ’ travel plan to encourage the use of public transport			1
but if it is so concerned about its carbon emissions , why does n’t it end its short - haul routes and tell passengers to take the train instead ? a spokesman for the airport ’s new owners , @entity160 , admitted that ‘ car parking is used to keep charges low for airlines , resulting in cheaper air fares for our passengers ’			1
what he really means is that the airport has lost business from budget airlines , which have been shopping around for cheaper landing fees elsewhere , and that the airport is reduced to trying to cream a profit from motorists instead			0
it is impossible to know how many passengers , stung by @entity114 ’s £ 2 drop - off charge , have vowed never to go back to the airport			1
but figures show that while there were 24 million passengers in 2007 , last year the number had dropped to 17.5 million			2
a spokesman for the airport says that its parking charges are now ‘ under review ’			0
if the airports want us to carrying on travelling , and spending money in their shops , perhaps they could start by removing the threats and excessive charges they are using to fleece us when we dare to travel to the airport by car			0
in other words , stop acting as pirates and concentrate on returning air travel to what it once was : a pleasure , not an experience which leaves us fuming before our plane has even taken off .			0

drop - off point at @entity14 will cost you £ 2
