@entity0 is already developing into a genuine star at @entity2 , and the @entity4 midfielder is now looking to legends of the game to improve his play			1
@entity0 , the only @entity8 player to feature in all of the club 's 25 games this season , has been a shining light in a disappointing start for @entity15 's side			2
and the 21 - year - old attributes his improvement to the experience of watching some of the great players , including club legend @entity20			2
@entity0 has played all of @entity2 's 25 first - team fixtures this season , largely in midfield the 21 - year - old is beginning to adapt his game to a central role , learning from legends in the process @entity20 returned to @entity2 in 2012 when @entity0 had just joined from @entity30 @entity2 's record goalscorer played alongside @entity0 during his return to the club in 2012 , and the @entity34 believes he learned a lot about the game from working with the @entity38 winner			1
@entity20 gave the young man ' endless amounts of advice ' , but it was by watching him train the @entity0 picked up the most			2
' you know when you see typical @entity20 , coming in from the left and you think " he is just going to open up here and curl it in the bottom corner and score like he always does " , ' he told @entity52			0
the 21 - year - old says training with @entity20 taught him a lot as a young player looking to improve his game @entity0 celebrates with @entity56 and @entity57 after @entity2 score at @entity59 ' what i remember is when he missed one of those chances in training			1
i 've never seen anyone be so angry with himself and disappointed			0
' the first thing he would says was " @entity20 , come on ! " it was just to himself out loud			0
it made you realise why he used to score them constantly			0
' with @entity20 having retired , and set for a possible coaching role at @entity2 , @entity0 has been watching other stars of @entity77 football to improve his game			1
as the @entity4 international moves inside into a central midfield role he has been studying the likes of @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , but it is @entity87 legend @entity86 who seems to have particularly caught his eye			1
@entity86 is among the midfield stars of @entity77 football that @entity0 has been watching the @entity2 star described @entity86 as ' one of the best ' , and says he would love to have a similar career ' i think he is one of the world 's best , ' said @entity94			1
' he does n't play as deep but he finds really good pockets in midfield , he turns and , whether he is going to shoot , pass or run with the ball , he causes problems			0
' i would love to get to there , to have the career that he has had			0
