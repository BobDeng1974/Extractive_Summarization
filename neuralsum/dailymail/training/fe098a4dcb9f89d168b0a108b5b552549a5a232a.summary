for all the noise surrounding the red half of @entity3 this summer , you could be forgiven for forgetting that this country 's pre-eminent football club are @entity6 , @entity8 title winners in two of the past three seasons			1
from @entity6 , there have been no grand proclamations			1
no talk of an unlimited budget			0
no new signings ordered to train alone in public view			0
no round of rumours over who will wear the captain 's armband			0
under the leadership of @entity24 - and directed from above by @entity25 and @entity26 - it is a calm and confident approach			2
this summer , they have added sensibly , strengthening the midfield with the commanding @entity46 @entity28 , providing competition for the excellent @entity48 with a move for @entity50 and they will , most probably this week , finally place a centre - half of elite standing alongside @entity54 with the £ 32million signing of @entity56			1
@entity6 's anxieties to conform to @entity57 regulations may deny them one final venture into the market to sprinkle some further stardust into @entity24 's attacking pool but the @entity64 will make do with glittering options that vary from @entity66 and @entity67 to @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
champion : @entity24 won the @entity8 and @entity72 in his first season in @entity38 gunner : @entity6 signed @entity74 international @entity50 on a free transfer after he left @entity76 for much of last season , @entity24 spoke of his desire not to have a fixed starting line - up but a fluid system of play that would allow any of his players to come in and perform to the same level , regardless of personnel			1
with a squad that is now blessed with two top - drawer players in every position , his ambitions are now coming to fruition			0
very few players are now assured a starting place , perhaps only @entity54 , @entity92 , @entity66 and @entity68			0
@entity37 will be under threat from @entity34 whose precise distribution appeals to @entity24 and indeed the system of play that is being adopted at all levels of the club , from the youth teams at age 11 to the first team			1
transfer : @entity6 are hopeful of tying up a £ 32m deal for @entity30 's centre back @entity56 @entity105 seen in @entity6 at full - back , @entity50 and @entity106 are at a similar level to @entity48 and @entity109			1
@entity110 has overcome his teething problems to enjoy a remarkable renaissance			0
in the midfield , @entity113 and @entity114 offer smart cover for @entity92 and @entity28			2
city are inundated with gifted footballers			0
they could quite easily field two teams of the highest quality			0
on the weekend , it could be : @entity37 , @entity50 , @entity54 , @entity110 , @entity109 , @entity28 , @entity92 , @entity66 , @entity69 , @entity68 , @entity70			1
for a midweek cup game , @entity24 can shuffle his pack and the standard would barely dip : @entity128 , @entity48 , @entity129 , @entity56 , @entity106 , @entity130 , @entity113 , @entity131 , @entity114 , @entity67 , @entity132			1
city have plenty to prove this season			0
at home , these players must demonstrate that they have the mentality to defend a @entity8 title , after releasing their grip so meekly the season before last			0
on the continent , @entity6 must finally arrive on the @entity144 stage and start providing the kind of unforgettable nights that have been the norm over the years at @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			2
there , is , though a feeling that this football club is beginning to mature into a consistent force and their rivals will know that @entity6 , once again , will be the team to beat this season			2
double trouble : the two possible teams @entity6 could line up with next season options : @entity67 has been impressing in pre-season and gives ellegrini yet another option up front			2

@entity166 have signed @entity130 , @entity50 , @entity34 and @entity28
@entity56 looks likely to follow them to @entity6
@entity24 could have two starting 11s
