by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:58 est , 20 february 2014 we swear far more on @entity5 than in the real world , researchers have found			2
a major analysis of 51 million @entity9 language tweets revealed that one in 13 contains a curse			1
researchers were also able to rank the most popular words , finding f * * k was the most popular - and the top seven accounted for over 90 % of offensive tweets			1
the most popular curse words on @entity5 : researchers examined a random one - month sample of 51 million @entity9 - language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts people curse more and more as the day passes , reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. just before they go to bed , the researchers found			1
they also found people swore earlier in the week - mondays , tuesdays , and wednesdays contained the most curse words relative to tweet volume			2
' it ’s a sizable fraction of the words we use , ' @entity29 , a phd researcher at @entity30 who led the study , told @entity35			0
' on average , one tweet out of 13 tweets will contain at least one cursing word , ' ' because of social media , people do n’t see each other			2
' they can say things they would n’t say in the physical world			0
' the team at @entity30 examined a random one - month sample of 51 million @entity9 - language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts			1
they found that we curse more on @entity5 than in real life , but tend to use only a few words			0
' we found that the curse words occurred at the rate of 1.15 % on @entity5 , and 7.73 % of all the tweets in our dataset contained curse words , ' the team wrote in their paper , which was presented this week at the @entity60 on @entity61			1
' we also found that seven most frequently used curse words accounted for more than 90 % of all the cursing occurrences			1
' the team say they wanted to find out it we cursed more on @entity5			0
' cursing is not uncommon during conversations in the physical world : 0.5 % to 0.7 % of all the words we speak are curse words , given that 1 % of all the words are first - person plural pronouns ( e.g. , we , us , our ) , ' the researchers wrote			1
lack of imagination : the top seven curse words accounted for 90 % of all curses , the researchers found ' on social media , people can instantly chat with friends without face - to - face interaction , usually in a more public fashion and broadly disseminated through highly connected social network			1
' they also classified the cursing , and identified five different emotions from tweets - anger , joy , sadness , love , and thankfulness			1
' based on the classification results , we found that cursing on @entity5 was most closely associated with two negative emotions : sadness and anger			0
' however , curse words could also be used to emphasize positive emotions such as joy or love			0
' other insights in the paper involved timing , location , gender , and level of influence of the tweeters			0
people curse more and more as the day passes , reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. before bedtime , and mondays , tuesdays , and wednesdays contain the most curse words relative to tweet volume			1
researcher say the hour before we go to sleep is when we are most likely to swear in a tweet they also found user swore less when talking directly to another user			0
' our study of the relation between cursing and message types suggests that users perform self - censorship when they talk directly to other users			2
' we find that users do curse more in relaxed environments , but the differences across different environments are very small , partly due to the fact that @entity5 messages are posted in virtual digital world			0
they also found men tended to swear more			0
' men curse more than women , men overuse some curse words different from what women use and vice versa , and both men and women are more likely to curse in the same - gender contexts			2
