women today may feel they have come a long way since the inequality of the @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5			0
but the shelves of many toy shops paint a very different story			0
where once toys may have been marketed in neutral colours to target both boys and girls , now they are much more likely to be gender stereotyped - blue for boys and pink for girls			1
the issue has been highlighted by campaign group @entity21 , who recently shared a picture comparing the toys on sale in @entity26 in the @entity5 to today on their @entity28 feed			1
avalanche of pink : a comparison by campaign group @entity21 shows how in the @entity5 , left , toys were in a variety of colours while today girls are pushed to embrace one shade while decades ago toy pushchairs , prams and household equipment like play ovens came in whites , reds and blues - aimed at both genders - today the majority are all pink			1
and while the items above aimed at girls relate to being domesticated , in contrast boys today are encouraged to play with science sets , cars and action heroes			2
let toys be toys , set up by a group of @entity58 parents last november , are calling for this to change			2
they are petitioning retailers to stop segregating their products ' for boys ' and ' for girls '			2
one of the campaign 's founders , @entity68 , 44 , a self - employed copywriter from @entity69 , who has a five - year - old daughter , told the @entity71 : ' it does bother a lot of parents , we seem to have tapped in to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are promoted according to outdated , illogical and sexist stereotypes			1
' i ca n’t speak for any of the others but what pushed me to make a stand was the realisation , after my daughter was born , that gender stereotyping in children ’s products had become worse than when i was a child myself back in the @entity5			1
it ’s something that has become almost impossible to escape and is very limiting for children			0
' shelves of a typical toy shop show the girl / boy divide : for the girls , it is all pink with @entity98 princess and @entity99 promoted while the toys for boys to the right are blue and @entity103 themed the @entity104 , which has already gained 6,000 signatures , states : ' in 2013 it is time to take down the signs , labels and categories that tell parents , grandparents and children that construction sets , adventure games , cars , science toys and superheroes are ' toys for boys ' , and that baby dolls , play kitchens , make - up sets , fashion , princesses and crafts are ' toys for girls '			1
' toys are for fun , for learning , for stoking imagination and encouraging creativity			0
children should feel free to play with the toys that most interest them			2
' research by @entity137 , a doctoral candidate in sociology at the @entity139 , has backed up @entity68 's belief that gender stereotyping of toys is getting worse			1
writing in the @entity143 last year , she said : ' we 've made great strides toward gender equity over the past 50 years , but the world of toys looks a lot more like 1952 than 2012			2
' during my research into the role of gender in @entity155 toy advertisements over the 20th century , i found that in 1975 , very few toys were explicitly marketed according to gender , and nearly 70 percent showed no markings of gender whatsoever			2
' in the 1970s , toy ads often defied gender stereotypes by showing girls building and playing airplane captain , and boys cooking in the kitchen			2
boys are encouraged to play with mechanical toys and science kits while for girls it 's all about dolls ' but by 1995 , the gendered advertising of toys had crept back to mid-century levels , and it ’s even more extreme today			1
in fact , finding a toy that is not marketed either explicitly or subtly ( through use of colour , for example ) by gender has become incredibly difficult			0
' let toys be toys believe this kind of gender stereotyping from an early age can be damaging for children			1
they state : ' whilst toys aimed at boys encourage activity and adventure , many girls ’ toys send the message that appearance is what matters			1
it ’s no surprise that the vast majority of adults with eating disorders are women			0
in his book , @entity202 , he points to how little girls are are continually being bombarded with the message that it 's their looks and being ' hot ' that is the most important thing			1
while the media is to blame , he also points to the toy industry playing their part			0
he gives the example of a new range of ' @entity213 aimed at girls ( predominantly pink of course ) that focuses on being beautiful and marginalises female roles in society			1
detrimental : child psychologists agree the stereotyping of toys is encouraging girls to think it 's only their appearance that matters he said : ' recently , the company ( @entity213 ) started producing five curvy plastic ' friends ' who bake , home - make , decorate , style hair and shop			1
plus a plastic female ghetto called @entity231 , which somehow manages to thrive without any fire - fighters or policemen			0
' as well as toys aimed at girls being given a pink makeover since the @entity5 , many children 's favourite characters have also been glamorised - driving home the message that appearance , above all , counts			1
@entity98 faced a backlash from parents ( and had to back down ) after they recently tried to make @entity245 from @entity246 more sexy by giving her larger eyes , a smaller waist and frizz - free hair			0
but a look back at other characters - including @entity253 and @entity254 - shows how this has been going on for years			0
while once these female characters looked wholesome and innocent , now they 're slimmer with longer legs and more make - up			0
backlash : @entity98 had to back down after giving @entity246 character @entity245 a sexy makeover , right even animals do n't escape a sexy make - over			0
the popular @entity263 - which back in the @entity264 did resemble the figure of a horse - has now been given long , slim legs , huge eyes complete with long false eyelashes and a long , wavy mane to rival the @entity271 's			0
it is n't just girls who suffer from the gender segregation of toys			1
it also leaves boys unable to play with what they want due to what ms @entity137 calls ' a homophobic culture ' of boys been mocked if they ' transgress into the ' pink ' zone ' and play with toys like dolls			2
let toys be toys believe by making and marketing toys in a more gender neutral way , children will truly have the freedom to develop			1
they state : ' this is n’t about political correctness			0
this is about doing the right thing by our children and giving them a real and varied choice			0
we believe in equality , but this is n’t about making children the same			0
it ’s about giving children the choice to be individuals			0
' @entity253 : in her modern day incarnation , right , the character is taller and slimmer with more make - up and slicker hair			0
while the @entity264 version looks like a little girl , today she is more like a woman @entity254 : the modern day version , right , has a slimmer figure , longer hair , bigger eyes and a smaller nose @entity263 : not so much a pony anymore , right , with longer , slimmer legs , bigger eyes and a a flowing mane @entity213 : in the @entity5 , the stables were red , white and blue , today , right , they are predominantly pink			1

campaign group @entity104 compared products from 70s to today
toys for girls are now predominantly pink
they say such gender stereotyping is restricting children 's development
girls given message appearance is what matters
