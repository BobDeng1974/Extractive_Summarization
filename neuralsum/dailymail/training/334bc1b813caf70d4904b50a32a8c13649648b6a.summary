braces are an awkward and often painful rite of passage for many teenagers , but they can transform the most crooked teeth into @entity5 smiles			1
a strangely captivating time - lapse video reveals how an 11 - year - old - girl ’s warped teeth were transformed over just 18 - months			1
it shows how her top teeth move down and into more uniform positions , as the wire straightens across her braces			2
it shows how her teeth move down and into more uniform positions , as the wire straightens across her braces she was treated by dr @entity21 of @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			1
people wear braces for cosmetic as well as structural reasons , such as correcting their bite and repositioning crooked teeth			1
while braces may be seen as a modern ‘ extra ’ when it comes to health and dental treatments , there is evidence that ancient people wrapped metal bands around their teeth in a bid to strengthen them			1
after : she was treated by dr @entity21 of @entity22 & @entity42 in @entity23 , @entity24 and this still shows her teeth following the 18 month orthodontic treatment people wear braces for cosmetic as well as structural reasons , such as correcting their bite and repositioning crooked teeth			1
the girl is pictured left , before wearing braces and right , after the treatment @entity51 mulled ways to straighten teeth in @entity54 and archaeologists have found mummies that appear to have metal bands wrapped around their teeth			0
sometimes a cord made from animal intestine was used to straighten teeth			0
a @entity63 tomb revealed teeth bound with gold wire			0
in 1728 , @entity67 dentist @entity66 wrote a book on methods of straightening teeth and is credited with inventing modern orthodontics			0
he used a horseshoe - shaped piece of iron to expand the arch of teeth			0
in the 19th century the field of orthodontics was officially recognised and new devices invented			0
gum elastics were first used and it was decided that mild force at timed intervals is the best way of encouraging the movement of teeth			0
in the early 20th century , @entity85 devised a classification system for crooked teeth , which is still used today			1
braces are able to move teeth by applying pressure on them			2
traditional braces comprise of four elements : brackets , bonding material , arch wire and ligature elastics , known as ‘ o - rings ’ to align teeth			2
teeth move when the arch wire puts pressure on the brackets , which are bonded to the teeth			0
o - rings are sometimes used to generate force in order to pull teeth in a certain direction			1
the tension of the arch wire is set at regular orthodontic appointments - typically a month apart - so that the correct amount of pressure is applied slowly over time			2
when pressure is applied on the teeth , their periodontal membrane stretches on one side and is compressed on the other			0
this loosens the teeth so that new bone grows to support them in their new positions			1
the process is called bone remodelling , which is the biomechanical process responsible for making bones stronger			0
if too much pressure is applied too quickly , the teeth can be loosened too fast for new bone to grow , meaning that a patient can be at risk of losing their teeth .			2

video reveals how an 11 - year - old *'s* crooked teeth were fixed in 18 - months
shows how teeth are moved *due* to the pressure *exerted* by braces
she was treated at @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24
braces are used to correct structural *problems* and for cosmetic reasons
they pull teeth in a certain direction to loosen them slowly so that new bone grows around them to support the teeth in their new , *desired* position
archaeological evidence *suggests* first ' braces ' were used in ancient times
