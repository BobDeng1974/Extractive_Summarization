@entity1 are looking to recapture the kind of form they hit under @entity4 , when they dominated @entity6 , @entity0 said on friday			1
the @entity8 club are in the process of rebuilding after they failed to win major silverware last season for the first time in six years and coach @entity14 has been replaced by @entity15			1

' this year will be tough but we have the goal and the ambition to repeat ( the successes of ) the 2008 - 09 season , ' he added			0
' we are tackling this year just like that one , with a lot of excitement			0
' @entity0 said there were ' some similarities ' with @entity1 ’s situation now and in 2008 when @entity4 took over from @entity52 before going on to win 14 of the 19 competitions he contested during four seasons in charge , including two @entity58 crowns and three @entity60 titles			1
