by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 27 february 2013 foolish : banned driver @entity2 , 22 , panicked when he was spotted riding his moped and decided to try and evade capture with a top speed of around 30mph , a second - hand 50cc moped would not be the getaway vehicle of choice for most criminals			1
but police pursuing @entity2 in a decidedly low - speed chase were determined not be beaten – and sent up the force helicopter			1
four patrol cars were also drafted in as the moped pootled along at 15mph			0
and after a not - so nail biting chase through the streets of @entity21 , the officers finally got their man			1
during the daylight pursuit , @entity2 , 22 , a disqualified driver , was seen slowing down for speed bumps , but also mounted pavements and swerved dangerously in front of cars			1
crew in the helicopter gave a running commentary on his progress and at one point emphasised the low speed he was riding at , telling colleagues on the ground : ‘ speed is 15 - one - five - miles an hour			1
’ @entity2 managed to evade two police cars on his £ 200 @entity38 for just over a mile before giving up and pulling over			1
at one stage , a man tried to punch him off the bike but narrowly missed him			0
@entity2 was arrested for dangerous driving , and driving while disqualified and without insurance			1
he admitted the offences as his barrister said he had been stupid			1
@entity46 heard @entity2 , a roofer , ‘ panicked ’ when he saw police and attempted to flee			1
footage from the 180mph helicopter , which is jointly owned by two forces – @entity50 and @entity51 and @entity52 – was played to the court			0
defending , @entity54 said : ‘ he panicked and behaved in a really stupid way			1
he was going to get caught			0
' there was no excessive speed			1
it was only a matter of time that police would arrest him and he stopped voluntarily after some distance			1
it was , perhaps , more stupid than dangerous under the circumstances			1
’ the court heard @entity2 , of @entity68 in @entity21 , had a previous conviction for dangerous driving when he drove a car from a burglary , from which others hurled bottles at police			1
he was also disqualified from driving for three years , ordered to take an extended driving test and pay a victim surcharge of £ 100			2
judge @entity96 told him : ‘ you are 22 and you ’ve clearly made a nuisance of yourself quite a lot in the past			2
‘ you drove dangerously , without insurance , when disqualified			0
‘ you do n’t need me to tell you it deserves a prison sentence			0
i have decided to suspend that sentence			0
‘ it looks to me as though you are growing up			0
that ’s what it ’s all about , is n’t it ? ’ he went on : ‘ you are 22 , you have responsibilities , a partner , a child , you have done courses and you work			2
’ after the case one officer said : ‘ you normally expect a bit of drama when the helicopter ’s up and you hear there ’s a chase on			2
' but this was more like a guided tour			1
on that moped he was going nowhere fast			0
’ @entity2 said yesterday : ‘ it was a stupid mistake , that ’s all			1
i do n’t know what i was thinking really			0
i would not do it again – i did n’t even think i would get away from them			0
’ asked why the helicopter was sent up , a spokesman for @entity50 said : ‘ whenever a vehicle fails to stop for police , the helicopter is requested to manage the pursuit to reduce the risk to members of the public			2
‘ the aircraft ’s observer will give a full commentary so experienced officers from the @entity143 can intercept the vehicle and bring the pursuit to a safe conclusion			0
’ he added : ‘ often the footage taken from the helicopter forms part of the evidence used to bring offenders to justice			0
’ @entity152 : the undramatic trip ended when he pulled onto a pavement as two more patrol cars dashed to the scene captured : @entity2 admitted he made a ' stupid mistake ' arrest : police officers surround @entity160 following the very low speed chase he was given a nine - month jail term suspended for 18 months and told to do 100 hours of unpaid work and undergo a thinking skills programme			1
he was also disqualified from driving for three years , ordered to take an extended driving test and pay a victim surcharge of £ 100			2
judge @entity96 told him : ' you are 22 and you 've clearly made a nuisance of yourself quite a lot in the past			2
' you drove dangerously , without insurance , when disqualified			0
' you do n't need me to tell you it deserves a prison sentence			0
i have decided to suspend that sentence			0
' it looks to me as though you are growing up			0
that 's what it 's all about , is n't it ? ' you are 22 , you have responsibilities , a partner , a child , you have done courses and you work			2
' after the case one officer said : ' you normally expect a bit of drama when the helicopter 's up and you hear there 's a chase on			2
' but this was more like a guided tour			1
on that moped he was going nowhere fast			0

@entity2 , 22 , ' sped ' through a *housing* estate on his 50cc @entity38
he continued on his futile journey for more than a mile
police chopper crew *reported* : ' speed is fifteen - one - five miles an hour '
' it was a stupid mistake ' admitted @entity160 after been banned from driving
' this was more like a guided tour ' said one police officer
