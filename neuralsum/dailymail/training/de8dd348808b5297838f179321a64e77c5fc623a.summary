lost and scared : worried visitors call 911 after getting caught in the @entity21 corn maze in @entity7 that spans a whopping 63 acres ' over the month that the maze was open , we got maybe seven calls , and in only three of those cases did the people actually call 911 , ' an officer told @entity29			1
' we tell them to relax and we put a call into the owner rather than send out a deputy			0
