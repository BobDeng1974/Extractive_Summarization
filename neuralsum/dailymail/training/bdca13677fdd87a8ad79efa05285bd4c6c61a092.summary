by @entity0 , science reporter published : 18:25 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 02:39 est , 8 june 2013 the country ’s biggest parenting charity has been accused of making women feel like failures if they do not have natural births			1
each year the @entity7 holds classes for 80,000 new parents , which it says provides evidence - based advice on one of life ’s most critical moments			1
but health experts and women ’s campaigners say the charity ’s guidance is inconsistent and champions natural births , leaving mothers who opt for aided deliveries feeling like failures			1
school of thought : former president of the royal college of @entity29 , @entity30 ( left ) said most women can deliver without any interference			0
professor @entity33 , a child stress expert at @entity36 ’s @entity35 , said the charity needed to ‘ tighten up ’ on the advice given by its practitioners at its 300 branches nationwide			2
‘ it seems apparent that in the classes very inconsistent advice is being given and it is not very evidence - based , ’ she said			1
‘ they do seem to be rather proselytising for natural births and home births , which are lovely if they work , but ca n’t work for everyone			1
‘ we very much want to help people have unaided births , which is fine , but not everyone can			2
it is very important not to make people feel like failures if they ca n’t			0
‘ the feedback i get is that they get very varied messages if you actually go to classes			2
they ought to tighten up on the practice of their practitioners			0
‘ the reality is it ’s often painful			0
often for medical reasons people need caesareans			0
there should be more realism in the education in the classes to prepare women for the variety of things that can happen			2
’ speaking at the @entity77 , science writer @entity76 said that although the @entity7 covered all the bases about types of pain relief , the focus on ‘ natural is best ’ in many classes was unhelpful			1
miss @entity76 , the author of pregnancy book @entity85 , said : ‘ the problem is there is this real disconnect between what the @entity7 as a central organisation says and does and what teachers do			1
‘ when i went to the nct i thought it was an evidence - based course to guide me through birth			2
actually what i was getting was distorted science			0
maternity ward : the charity is said to champion natural births and home births so much so that women have said they feel like failures for having pain relief methods of delivery : science writer @entity76 said the charity 's courses gave a distorted sense of the science involved in childbirth and focused too much on natural births ‘ they basically make out that the birth experience is a choice and you can make decisions about the kind of birth you can have , when in fact it is often down to your body			1
’ she added : ‘ there needs some accountability for teachers who are not following the @entity7 ’s central line			1
because people do trust them , and pregnant women are uniquely vulnerable and they are worried and want to do the best for their baby			0
’ the @entity7 , formed in 1956 as the @entity129 , has 100,000 members			2
last year it stopped telling mothers to breastfeed after concerns that its ‘ breastapo ’ tactics were alienating some women , particularly among the working class			0
earlier this year tv presenter @entity137 , whose two sons were delivered by caesarean , dismissed its advice as ‘ b * * * * * * * ’ and called it ‘ a politicised , dogmatic and scary organisation ’			0
last night the trust ’s chief , @entity143 , said : ‘ our nct practitioners are trained to help expectant parents prepare for all eventualities in the lead up to their birth so they are best prepared to face any challenges if events turn out differently			0
‘ courses cover all subjects that are important to expectant parents , but ultimately the focus of the class is determined by the members themselves			0
as a result , every @entity7 course across the @entity160 will vary slightly in content			1
