being substituted before the hour and having a whole stadium boo you as you go off does not usually bring a smile to a player ’s face but @entity5 could not stop himself from grinning on thursday night			1
it was the same smile he wore when he spoke after the game about the moment he was hooked after 57 minutes and 80,000 @entity10 fans let their feelings towards him known			0
they had taunted him for years because he had only ever scored one goal against them now they were upset because he had just dumped them out of the @entity18			0
‘ it was the smile of satisfaction at having done my job , ’ he said as he left the @entity20 feeling better about his career than he has since his @entity22 days			2
@entity5 is back finding the net after struggling to do so at @entity27 and the @entity28 and he is not the first striker to benefit from a spell at the @entity31			2
@entity5 celebrates opening the scoring for @entity33 after just 49 seconds at the @entity34 @entity5 ( left ) is congratulated by team - mates after scoring in the first minute against @entity10 @entity36 posted a picture oof @entity5 and his @entity33 team - mates celebrating in the visitors ' dressing room another who rose from the ashes in @entity44 after suffering in the @entity45 was @entity46			1
after only scoring 10 goals at @entity48 in 63 games he moved to @entity50 and won the @entity51 twice			0
the second of those @entity54 top scorer awards was won while at @entity33 where @entity46 also won the @entity55 in 2010 and went off to the @entity56 in such good form that he came back with the @entity58 awarded the tournament ’s best player			1
if the @entity31 is not resuscitating failing careers it ’s serving to maximise the potential of others that have just begun			0
@entity65 was only 17 when club director @entity66 flew with then @entity68 director @entity67 to @entity69 to sign the boy they believed would be the next big thing for 23m euros ( £ 17.5m )			2
five years later they were selling him for 45m euros ( £ 34.3m ) to @entity74			0
@entity5 enjoyed a slice of good fortune as keeper @entity77 deflected the ball into the net @entity65 was signed by @entity33 for £ 17m and later sold to @entity74 for double that price like @entity5 , @entity46 struggled to score in the @entity45 , but found his form at @entity33 and no sooner was @entity82 gone from @entity33 than @entity83 stepped in			1
he in turn was replaced by @entity85 who this season has been replaced by @entity87 and @entity88 with the latter looking like he will fulfil his potential just as @entity65 and @entity83 did and the former putting his career back on track after a tumultuous last season at @entity94 under @entity95			1
@entity33 is where good young strikers go to become great and to save a dying career there really is no place like the @entity31			1
for @entity5 , there really is no place like home			2
he has now scored two goals against @entity10 in a week			0
that is two more than he scored against them in six years in his previous spell			0
little wonder despite having been taken off early on thursday night , he could n’t stop smiling			0
after @entity46 and @entity65 , @entity83 became the club 's main striker , helping them win the @entity55 @entity85 blossomed last season , helping them win @entity114 and reach the @entity116 final @entity117 forward @entity87 joined the club from @entity94 in the summer			1

@entity5 made his name at @entity33 as a *youngster*
and now he has *returned* to the club after a *difficult* period in his career
the club have a good record of getting the best out of strikers
@entity65 , @entity83 , @entity85 and @entity46 prove that
