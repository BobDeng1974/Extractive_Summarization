@entity0 : a life by @entity2 queen @entity0 in her wedding dress as @entity2 notes in his new biography of @entity4 @entity0 : ‘ some human beings change and develop , and that is their strength			1
for others , strength consists in their incapacity for change			0
’ @entity0 ’s character , he argues , remained fixed in its essential qualities throughout her long life			1
he believes that the key to her capricious and fascinating nature , which imposed itself so powerfully on the era that bears her name , can be found in her childhood			0
the infant @entity0 was the product of an unseemly scramble by the sons of @entity27 to produce a legitimate heir to the throne , and it was the @entity30 who hit the jackpot when he hastily married a @entity33 princess , @entity32			1
having sired a daughter , the @entity34 expired from a chill in january 1820 , leaving his widow and nine - month - old child to the mercy of the @entity41 court where they felt like — indeed , were — foreign poor relations			2
@entity0 firmly believed her childhood was miserable			1
in 1858 she wrote , ‘ i			1
led a very unhappy life as a child — had no scope for my very violent feelings of affection — had no brothers and sisters to live with — never had a father — from my unfortunate circumstances was not on comfortable or at all intimate or confidential footing with my mother — much as i love her now — and did not know what a happy domestic life was			0
’ this , her biographer crisply points out , is largely nonsense			2
she had an older half - brother and sister , prince @entity60 and princess @entity61 , of whom she was deeply fond , and her mother ’s devotion is touchingly evident in a flurry of loving notes on pink paper written to @entity0 throughout her childhood			1
‘ believe me , my most beloved child , that nobody in this world can love you better than , your true and affectionate mother ’ , she wrote on @entity68 1828			1
but as @entity2 points out , there are two kinds of unhappy childhood : in one , the child has genuinely suffered			0
in the other , childhood is an unhappy memory			0
the monarch became bitter in her older age and was prone to tantrums @entity0 ’s ‘ almost unbounded capacity for self - dramatisation and self - pity ’ , he argues , left her with a strong , unfounded conviction of her wretched early years which led her throughout her life to exhibit the furious egotism of a small child			1
‘ it was for this reason , ’ he writes , ‘ that her best friends were servants , or those prepared			1
to behave as if they were servants			0
’ in old age , her fervent relationships with her bluff @entity98 servant , @entity99 , and later to @entity100 , known as the @entity101 , who taught her to say ‘ you will miss the @entity101 very much ’ and ‘ hold me tight ’ in @entity104 , would be the cause of scandal and horror among her entourage			1
but from the earliest days of her reign , her obstinate wilfulness would repeatedly have grave consequences for the image of the monarchy			0
on her @entity116 day , june 28 1838 , the 18 - year - old @entity4 wrote in her diary of her awe at seeing ‘ the millions of my loyal subjects who were assembled in every spot to witness the procession			1
how proud i felt to be the queen of such a @entity123			0
’ but just two years later she had contrived to make the monarchy a hated institution			2
her behaviour in the @entity127 , when she refused to smooth the sensibilities of a new @entity130 administration by appointing a @entity130 @entity131 , convinced the political world that she was a capricious incompetent			0
worse still was her spiteful treatment of her old childhood acquaintance , @entity135			0
when the unmarried @entity135 ’s waistline began expanding and rumour suggested that she was pregnant , the @entity4 insisted that she be examined by the royal doctor , sir @entity138			0
the poor woman was a virgin , suffering from a malignant abdominal tumour which killed her in 1839			0
the public scandal was appalling , but @entity0 refused to take it seriously , airily doubting whether the affair was ‘ really making such a sensation as people said it did ’			1
if her public behaviour was outrageous , she was scarcely better in private			0
her marriage to @entity151 was notoriously one of intense attraction and sexual fulfilment , and it produced nine children — all of whom , remarkably , survived , though the youngest , @entity158 , suffered from the haemophilia that would become the scourge of the courts of @entity162 as @entity0 ’s descendants married into them			1
queen @entity0 on the arm of her @entity168 servant @entity100 with whom she had a fervent relationship but @entity0 was not a doting mother			2
some of her children — notably her first - born son , @entity173 , the future @entity175 — she frankly disliked , and soon after the marriage of her eldest daughter , @entity177 , she wrote : ‘ i can not tell you how happy i am that you are not in an unenviable position [ pregnant ]			1
though i quite admit the comfort and blessing good and amiable children are — they are also an awful plague and anxiety for which they show one so little gratitude very often ! what made me so miserable was to have the first two years of my married life utterly spoilt by this occupation ! ’ even the adored @entity151 was not immune from her frightful tantrums			1
in 1857 he wrote her a pained note : ‘ i do n’t yet know why my question			2
“ what makes you so bitter ? ” produced such an outburst			2
i am trying to keep out of your way until			0
you have regained control of yourself			0
’ @entity0 ’s mourning after @entity151 ’s untimely death in december 1861 ( for which she partly blamed the hapless @entity173 ) plunged her still deeper into self - absorption , from which she was rescued by her passion for one of the @entity206 ghillies — @entity99			1
‘ [ @entity207 ] is devoted to me , ’ wrote the @entity4			1
‘ so simple , so intelligent , so unlike an ordinary servant ’			2
the @entity4 's stubborn nature was her defining characteristic indeed he was not			0
prone to bawling the @entity4 ’s orders in his broad @entity98 accent , he was fond of whisky , and the @entity4 developed a taste for a deadly concoction of claret mixed with whisky			0
so extravagant was her mourning when @entity99 died in 1883 that rumour circulated that they had been married			0
@entity2 finds striking evidence in the testimony of a retired clergyman that this may have been the case , and concludes that their 20 - year relationship was certainly a ‘ marriage ’ in emotional terms — though he does n’t commit himself on the question of whether it was formally solemnised or consummated			1
@entity2 is affectionately alert to the rich contradictions of his subject ’s personality , and his deliciously readable biography becomes increasingly fascinating as @entity0 ’s reign unfolds			2
the brilliance of his writing is especially striking in the final pages , when he lists the extraordinary quantity of stuff @entity0 wanted to be buried with : an entire jumble - sale of mementoes , including @entity99 ’s handkerchief and his mum ’s wedding ring			1
‘ parents who put a certain type of imaginative child to bed find they are unable to do so without adding			2
so many things crammed into the bedding that it is hard to know where the child will find to sleep , ’ @entity2 writes			0
it is an extraordinary perception : the unspeakably grand octogenarian queen - empress , monarch for 63 years , laid to her final rest like the vulnerable small child she once was .			0
