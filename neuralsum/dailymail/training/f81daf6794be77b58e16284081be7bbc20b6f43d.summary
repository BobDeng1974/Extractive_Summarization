by @entity0 do you regularly have more than six drinks in one sitting ? or do you regret a drunken escapade that took place in the past year ? if you have answered yes to either question , you may have a drink problem , according to research			1
a paper published by @entity11 advises that @entity12 should change the way they approach the subject of drinking in routine appointments a paper published by @entity11 today advises that @entity12 change the way they approach drinking in routine appointments			1
the study found that a positive answer to either of these two questions can correctly identify those with alcohol problems in 87 per cent of cases			1
although these are not strong enough results to immediately diagnose someone as an alcoholic , it is enough to effectively rule out those with no drink problem			1
and those who do pose a concern should be referred on for further questioning which can establish a more accurate picture			0
if the research , published today in the @entity37 , is taken on board it could spell an end to gps asking how many units someone drinks a week			2
according to the research , @entity12 should instead ask , ‘ do you drink six or more drinks on one occasion once a month or more frequently ? ’ and follow it up with : ‘ as a result of your drinking , did anything happen in the last year that you wish did n’t happen ? ’ if a patient answers positively to either question , a second set of four more detailed questions should be asked			1
the research team believe the findings could make it easier for @entity12 to identify drinking problems which would otherwise remain hidden			1
patients ’ answers could either rule out alcohol issues , or could bring to light potentially excessive or unsafe drinking habits			2
dr @entity64 , whose team analysed 17 previous alcohol studies involving 5,646 patients , said : ‘ there is great time pressure in primary care			0
‘ gps do n’t have the time to ask a long list of questions for every single patient			0
the shorter the survey , the more acceptable it is for @entity78 – but the greater the danger that it is inaccurate			0
‘ our work shows that asking just two questions to patients works modestly well , but they need to be followed up by a longer questionnaire of four questions in those who initially screen positive			0
’ the researchers found that asking two questions could correctly identify those with alcohol problems in 87.2 per cent of cases , and correctly identify those who did not have alcohol problems in 79.8 per cent of cases			2
dr @entity64 added : ‘ at the moment , gps ask patients about alcohol problems during about 3 per cent of consultations			0
‘ routine screening using simple questions are an attempt to improve the situation			0

research advises @entity12 to change approach to drinking in appointments
study by @entity11 found *doctors* should ask two key questions
it said the answers could effectively rule out those without a drink problem
