forward @entity0 scored twice and made a late third for @entity2 to ease @entity3 into the third round of the @entity5 as on - loan @entity7 winger @entity6 enjoyed a promising debut against @entity9 at the @entity10			1
while the prospect of seeing @entity6 - who had not started a club game since scoring for @entity13 in an @entity15 fourth round tie at @entity16 in january - for the first time hardly enticed the locals to the game in their droves , there were some encouraging elements to be seen in a 3 - 0 victory			1

aside from some threatening runs from the @entity69 international the display by @entity33 at left - back , one of nine changes from sunday 's @entity73 draw at @entity74 , was another positive as was the late debut handed to 16 - year - old academy graduate @entity76			0
former @entity77 defender @entity33 produced some inviting crosses from the flank , one which resulted in @entity0 ' opener and others which could have brought more			0
but most of the attention was on @entity6 and how he would perform having been farmed out on loan again by @entity85			2
last season he began his spell at @entity87 looking like he had something to prove but quickly faded and by the end was nothing more than a bit - part player			0
manager @entity92 has promised the 23 - year - old he will get much more pitch time under him and on the evidence of his first man - of - the - match performance he is unlikely to have to wait until the next round of this competition for another go			2
he could have capped his debut with a goal on the hour but fired into the side - netting with only goalkeeper @entity46 to beat			2
acrobatic : @entity2 of @entity3 has a shot on goal against @entity9 on the run : @entity3 's @entity6 takes on @entity54 of @entity9 the league cup may be of secondary consequence to @entity73 sides but @entity9 , second in @entity111 a mere 54 places below their hosts , also seemed less than interested with eight changes of their own			1
without the squad depth of their opponents it was always likely to affect them more and the first half saw @entity3 create a number of chances - many via the left boot of @entity126 - but convert only one			0
with @entity9 's defence almost obsessed with the aerial threat of @entity2 - who could easily have had a hat - trick himself - midfielder @entity53 dropped deep to get a hold of the striker 's shirt and @entity0 slipped in almost unnoticed to turn in @entity33 's cross			1
either of @entity6 or @entity2 should have made it 2 - 0 immediately as the former 's shot was parried by @entity46 who gratefully claimed the rebounded effort			1
up for it : @entity2 heads at goal in front of a completely empty stand chances continued to fall to @entity0 , @entity2 , @entity6 , @entity34 and @entity32 , the latter denied by @entity46 who stuck up a hand to and claim the loose ball with the @entity10 already celebrating a goal			1
two minutes after the break @entity6 ' speed took him clear down the left and his cross presented @entity0 , who has been linked with a move away from the @entity10 after falling down the pecking order , with the easiest of tap - ins before a charging @entity46 denied his hat - trick attempt			1
@entity9 's resistance was broken as @entity2 twice headed wide via crosses from either flank , @entity6 fired into side - netting before his debut was ended after 63 minutes and @entity34 shot straight at the goalkeeper			1
@entity3 's goalkeeper @entity163 , making only his fifth appearance since joining from @entity165 for Â£ 4million in january 2013 , tipped over @entity57 's shot from a rare @entity9 attack before @entity2 finally got on the scoresheet with a header in the 90th minute			2
@entity56 of @entity9 moves away from @entity31 of @entity3			0

@entity0 scored twice as @entity3 booked place in round three of @entity5
striker @entity2 capped victory with *injury* - time strike
on - loan @entity7 winger @entity6 made his debut for @entity3
