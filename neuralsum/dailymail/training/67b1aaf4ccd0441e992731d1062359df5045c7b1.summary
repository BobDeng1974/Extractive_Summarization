by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:23 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:38 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 with her baby boy , @entity5 , in @entity6 , @entity7 and the rest of her family two sisters who live more than 3,000 miles apart have given birth within minutes of each other			1
the siblings even kept up with each other on @entity15 as they both went through labour at home			2
it was an almost incredible coincidence for @entity19 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , who gave birth to her sixth son , @entity24 on friday 6 december			1
minutes before the delivery , her sister @entity3 , 29 , gave birth to a baby boy , @entity5 , in @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity19 was supported by community midwives @entity31 and @entity32 , from @entity33 , who called it their most amazing home birth yet			2
@entity19 , 33 , who gave birth 19 minutes after @entity3 , said : ' it was amazing			1
we joked about it but never dreamed that it would happen			0
' we both had home births , we both had boys and we gave birth on the same day , 19 minutes apart , although because of the time difference i was in the afternoon and she was in the morning			1
' the women said they had been comparing notes and their bumps on @entity50 all the way through their pregnancies			0
@entity19 added : ' this happened because @entity3 was five days late and i was two days early			1
we are going to call our boys ‘ cousin twins ’			0
' crowding round to see the new arrival with father @entity57 were @entity19 ’s other sons : @entity59 , seven , @entity60 , six , @entity61 , five , @entity62 , three and 12 - month - old @entity63			2
new baby @entity64 at home with father @entity57 and in the arms of his mother @entity19 , who gave birth just minutes after her sister @entity19 said : ' i always wanted a bunch of boys			1
this was my second home birth in @entity76 - my other four boys were born in the @entity7 - and the midwives , @entity78 and @entity32 were fantastic			0
it was definitely more relaxing to give birth at home in my own bed			0
@entity19 ’s mother @entity83 was in @entity84 at the time of the births and was trying to keep tabs on both her daughters as they went through labour			2
@entity19 is originally from @entity84 and moved to @entity20 after meeting her husband who works as a pastor at @entity92			0
midwives @entity31 on the left and @entity32 on the right , assisted @entity19 during her home delivery of baby @entity24 @entity31 , leader of @entity21 women ’s @entity97 of midwives , based in @entity100 , said : ' nothing like this has ever happened before at any of my home births			1
@entity19 and her sister were sometimes facebooking each other during their labour			0
' thousands of babies were being born that day all over the world but it was amazing and a privilege to feel connected to two babies being born at home in two different countries			0
' as a midwife , it is humbling to think you are just one of many midwives all over the world caring for women in labour			0

sisters @entity3 , 29 , and @entity19 , 33 , were given different *due* dates
but @entity3 **'s** baby came five days late and @entity19 **'s** three days early
live *opposite* sides of @entity128 : @entity19 in @entity21 ; @entity3 in @entity6
both gave birth to sons and used @entity15 to stay in touch during labour
