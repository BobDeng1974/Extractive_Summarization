the comic was propositioned several times from members of the parenting website , with some of the women even offering to run away with him			1
the conversation covered everything from custard creams and spray tans to feminism and the problem with the voting system			1
but he was also hung out to dry for his previous treatment of women , including using prostitutes			1
@entity0 was propositioned several times by members of the website			1
he also discussed the merits of biscuits like penguins and custard creams			1
but the star was also criticised for his treatment of women , including prostitutes at one point @entity0 did appear to be confused by the types of conversations he appeared to be having			1
when one user asked what he had imagined @entity6 to be like , he responded : ' i thought there 'd be a lot more mums and people with prams and more breastfeeding			2
' several of the women posting questions made their affections for the star very clear , one said : ' i 'm totally up for it btw , ' while another wrote : ' thank you for regularly popping up in my dreams ;-) # mumsnetfilthbench			2
' one lady went as far as to openly ask @entity0 about whether he was attracted to older women			1
the user @entity60 wrote : ' do you have a soft spot for dark - haired , sultry , older women who also support @entity64 ? ' @entity0 replied : ' yes â€“ very much			1
i 'm forever blowing bubbles , @entity64 forever			2
let 's run away from all this			2
' the 39 - year - old also tackled some of his biggest gripes about the current ruling party , but not before disclosing his feelings on the perfect biscuit			0
despite his constant speeches against what he calls the country 's elite , @entity0 ( pictured here at @entity78 ) admitted that he was in two minds about whether the monarchy should be abolished when asked what his favourite biccie was , he said : ' i know this a sensitive issue - i would say @entity85 and @entity86 , although some would say they are not biscuits as they are individually - packaged			1
' i also quite like a @entity89			0
' i am against @entity90 - you might as well eat a communion wafer			0
' on a more serious note , @entity0 claimed that @entity94 and the fellow members of his @entity97 government were stunted from their privileged childhoods , which saw many educated in private boarding schools			1
@entity0 was on he site top promote his new book revolution he said : ' i think that 's really significant and an overlooked aspect of it			1
' we are being governed by people who have been brought up in compassion-less paddocks and inculcated in solipsism			0
' @entity0 , who has been on the promo trail with his new book revolution in recent weeks , went on to claim that there was more of a point in voting in television talent shows like the @entity114 than in a local or general election			1
he said : ' when we vote for @entity117 or @entity118 , it makes a difference - if you vote for @entity94 , it does n't			1
' but despite his constant speeches against what he calls the country 's elite , @entity0 admitted that he was in two minds about whether the monarchy should be abolished			1
when asked if we needed the royal family , he said : ' no.			0
because i love the pageantry , the outfits , the ceremony			0
but i know in my heart that it 's a symbol of elitism and the hierarchy - how could it be anything else			2
' @entity0 also used the conversation to express regret at some of his past behaviour towards women			1
in his earlier years of fame , he would often sleep with a different girl every night and once bragged of having sex with nine girls in one evening			0
he has also spoken openly of using sex workers during his teenage years and went into detail about one experience with a @entity150 prostitute during a television show earlier this year			0
the women on the site attacked him often for his past use of working girls and many claimed that he was a misogynist			1
he replied : ' i hope i was never a misogynist			0
' complicated , being a man : primal drives , compassion , spiritual awakening , need for status - a tangled , knotted mess of threads , when unraveled all lead to ...			0
. not misogyny i hope			0
@entity0 also used the conversation on the parenting website to express regret at some of his past behaviour towards women			1
the comic has admitted to using prostitutes when he was younger - before he met his ex-wife @entity176 ' sometimes , i said things that were a bit sexist , i think it 's the same way my nan was a bit racist , she was a product of her time and environment , her natural compassion rebuffed and redirected by the culture of @entity187			1
' with reflection , and contemplation , we all arrive at a place of non-judgement			0
' in the past i have done things that are regrettable			0
' i was a heroin addict , a criminal , selfish , egotistical			0
' obviously , i 'm still not perfect , i 'm travelling in the right direction			0
' if we preclude the possibility for change and improvement , then who among us is n't f * * * * d ? ' as well as admitting regret over his past , @entity0 was also keen to join the likes of @entity205 and @entity206 in claiming himself a fan of the feminist cause			2
when asked by one reader if he was a feminist , he said : ' i do n't know what the requirements are			0
i certainly support equal rights regardless of age race and sexual persuasion			0
' i also think a good many of the problems we face in society are because of a gender imbalance because women have been unrepresented for centuries			2
' since returning from @entity222 , @entity0 has been getting increasingly involved in politics			2
here he is alongside @entity224 and @entity225 on an episode of @entity227 as well as promoting his new book revolution , @entity0 also revealed that he would be concentrating much of his literary efforts on extending his range of children 's books			1
he said : ' i started writing for children because i think fairy stories are important moral and ethical codes and i think a lot of the problems we face now are because we 're trying to live without a map - we 've lost touch with religion and spirituality			0
' and by talking directly to children , there 's a possibility of communicating directly with the thing in all of us that understands what it is to be good , and aligned and compassionate , before we get muddled up by adulthood			2
' i am planning on writing some more children 's books , including @entity252			2
' despite his regular speeches on the wicked elite and appearance at anti-capitalism protests here in the @entity258 , @entity0 does maintain that there are several aspects of the country that he is still proud of			2
when asked what he loves about @entity258 , he said : ' everything			0
' loads of things : our sense of humour , our language , our football teams , our sense of fairness and justice and our willingness to embrace new cultures			0
' the star had a slightly shorter list when asked what he missed about his birth county of @entity280 , he said : ' the people			0
