the teenagers called investigators from @entity13 on @entity14 , saying they were lost and their cellphone was dying			2
from hero to zero ? @entity10 called @entity8 , pictured , her hero after their dramatic rescue last month but now he 's been charged with meth possession @entity8 was discovered three days later , dehydrated and delirious			1
@entity10 was found the next day , hypothermic and confused			1
both recalled little from their ordeal , beyond hallucinations			2
@entity10 said that she had wild thoughts her parents had been sentenced to prison time , a python was eating her and that @entity8 , 19 , had told her he was having visions of a tiger			1
the search to find them required 1,900 man - hours and cost taxpayers an estimated $ 160,000			2
a deputy was injured while trying to rescue @entity36			1
he faces up to three years in jail if convicted , reports the @entity38			1
@entity10 was rescued shoeless and clinging to a mountain ledge on april 4 having suffered frostbite and cuts and bruises on her legs that made walking difficult for her			1
@entity10 , one of two hikers lost for nearly a week in the @entity47 last month , revealed that they suffered from hallucinations during their ordeal ' i do n't remember drinking anything , ' said @entity10 to @entity51			1
' i know i ate dirt			2
i tried to eat some dirt and rocks			2
i came to the hospital with a big mouthful of dirt and that 's all i remember			0
' describing her hallucinations , @entity10 said that the wilderness got to her , making her imagine that animals were trying to attack her and her companion			1
' my parents were in jail half the time , in my mind , and i was searching for my little sister , so that 's all i remember , ' said @entity10			1
' i was being eaten by a python			0
like @entity70 saw a tiger , i was being eaten by a python half the time			2
' @entity10 and @entity8 began their fateful trek on @entity14 in @entity75 in @entity3 on what was their first date			1
@entity10 , told reporters that starvation and dehydration led to her eating dirt and hallucinating that she was being attacked by a snake @entity10 is transported by wheelchair and flanked by hospital staff , security and her parents for a press conference outside @entity90 in @entity38 , @entity3 last month it was while at the top of a mountain that took them six hours that the inexperienced hikers realized they had exhausted the water supply			1
' we wanted to touch the clouds , ' said @entity10			1
' that 's why we went up there			0
we wanted to be in the clouds at the top			0
' and in newly released 911 calls made as the panicked pair realized they were stranded , @entity8 sounds incoherent			1
' we have fire i mean , ' @entity8 told the 911 operator according to @entity51			1
' i mean we have a lighter or something we can light something up			0
' the 911 operator can be heard to struggle with @entity36 as he tries to find out where the pair have got themselves lost			1
' stop for one second			0
what is the address ? ' @entity36 can be overheard saying to @entity10			1
' i do n't know , ' she replies			0
relief : @entity8 , center , hugs his brother , left , and mother , right , after he was released from @entity123 @entity10 told reporters that the battery on @entity36 's cellphone failed before the 911 operator could track the signal - and that is when they began to panic			1
' i said just hold onto me			0
let 's go back down the canyon , ' @entity8 said sunday after being released from hospital			1
' and i must 've fallen			0
and i do n't know if @entity10 took a fall and was unconscious			2
' once separated , the two were unaware even if the other one had survived			0
@entity8 was found barefoot , shirtless and disorientated and @entity10 was found the next morning handing from a rocky ledge the size of a yoga mat. following confusion over their accounts of how they became lost and separated , @entity8 said he was worried @entity10 , 18 , would blame him for what happened			1
he said he had been told not to contact her and was concerned when she had n't got in touch , but then she sent him a @entity149 message insisting his words of encouragement when they got lost were ' what kept me going ' and that she loved him and missed him			2
drama in the wild : @entity10 , 18 , is airlifted to safety by @entity156 after being missing for five days in rugged country near @entity158 , @entity3 risky adventure : @entity10 's father said his daughter called him to say that she is going on a hike , which was unusual for her ' i heard a lot of really mean things that were being said about me ... and when she was saved i had n't heard from her and everyone was telling me not to call , ' @entity8 told reporters outside @entity170 hospital			1
' but then i get a ( @entity149 ) post from @entity10			2
' then he read out the heartfelt message			0
' hi @entity70 , all i think about is you			0
it 's hard to make sense of it all and everything that has happened , ' she wrote , before explaining how when she was rescued , she was n't even aware that she had been hiking with him			2
' then i remember you telling me to calm down and that you were going to get me out of there and that 's what kept me going , ' she went on			0
' thank you so much and i love you and miss you more than words can describe			0
you are my hero @entity173			0
' @entity8 also described how he spent much of the ordeal in a dream - like state and even thought the search helicopters flying above him were hallucinations			1
' the last thing i could tell you was going into a lucid dream , ' he said			0
' i ca n't even tell you when i woke up			0
i was in lucid dreams and hallucinations for days			2
' he said that while he was wandering in the arid surrounds , he reflected on what he considered recent selfish behaviors , like focusing too much on himself and not enough on his family			0
' so that 's why when all this happened , i did n't cry , i did n't fear it			0
i said , " this is what i deserve , " ' @entity8 said			2
' i just knew i would get through it			0
i knew this was n't my time to die			0
i knew that i needed this , to become the person that i 'm supposed to be			0
' the two teen hikers were just a couple of miles from a shopping mall , and were able to make out the @entity217 skyline and hear the rumbles of downtown traffic from where they wandered off trail			0
and although the sprawling expanse of @entity3 suburbia is clearly visible from the forest 's ridgelines , in the canyon where they were trapped the brush was so thick they could n't find a road that was just 500 feet away .			0
