a @entity1 student claims he tried to call 911 after ' @entity2 ' told him she was gang raped at a frat house but she stopped him because she ' just wanted to go to bed '			1
@entity6 - who is revealing his name for the first time - says he had his phone in his hand and told his friend , referred to as @entity2 , that she should call the police after claiming she was sexually assaulted by a group of students			1
but as the 20 - year - old started to dial 911 , @entity2 told him that she ' did n't want to ' , he has claimed			1
the friends told @entity25 that the article was wrong on a number of key points , especially its assertion that they urged the victim to not report the attack			1
@entity6 , a third - year student was referred to as ' @entity33 ' in the @entity22 article			1
he told the @entity25 : ' i could n't help but notice that everything that the article said about me was incorrect			2
' the @entity25 also spoke with the other two friends portrayed in the article : third - year , 20 - year - old @entity1			1
students @entity19 and @entity41 , known as ' @entity42 ' and ' @entity43 ' in the article			0
a @entity22 magazine article suggested the trio did little to help their friend @entity2 ( pictured ) after she was sexually assaulted the main focus of the piece is an alleged gang rape that @entity2 said happened on sept. 28 , 2012 , during her first semester on campus			1
in the article , she said she had gone out on a date with a classmate named ' @entity56 , ' who later that night lured her into a secluded room at a frat house			1
once inside the room , she said , she was raped by a group of seven fraternity brothers while her date and one other man watched			0
as described in the @entity22 article , a distraught @entity2 met her three friends at a picnic table about a 20 - minute walk from the frat house and tearfully told them what had happened			1
while the article said @entity6 suggested they take her to the hospital , it described @entity20 and @entity19 as carrying on a debate about what would happen to her reputation and theirs should word get out			1
' the three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting @entity2 's rape , while @entity2 stood beside them , mute in her bloody dress , wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep , forgetful sleep , ' the article said			1
' detached , @entity2 listened as @entity42 prevailed over the group : ' she 's gon na be the girl who cried rape , and we 'll never be allowed into any frat party again			2
'' however , @entity19 told the @entity25 that not only did she not say any of that , she had arrived with @entity20 to the picnic table only to have @entity2 say she did n't want her to be part of the conversation			2
she said she watched from afar while @entity20 and @entity6 talked with @entity2			2
as described by @entity6 to the @entity25 , this is what happened : he had returned home from a party when he got a call from @entity2			1
he left to meet her and she was sitting on the top of a picnic table outside @entity1			2
she was shaking and ' it looked like she had been crying , ' @entity6 said			0
' her lip was quivering , her eyes were darting around			0
and right then , i put two and two together			0
i knew she had been on this date and people do n't usually look like that after a date			0
' @entity2 eventually told @entity6 and @entity20 her version of what happened that night : that she was forced to perform oral sex on five men at the frat house			1
' my first reaction was , ' we need to go to police , '' he said			0
' i wanted to go to police immediately			0
i was really forceful on that , actually			0
and i almost took it to calling ( the police ) right there			0
' he said he had his phone out , prepared to call 9 - 1 - 1 , ' but she did n't want to and , ' he remembers thinking , '' i ca n't do that if she does n't want to do it			0
'' @entity20 corroborated this version of events			0
misrepresented ? identified as @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity33 in the @entity22 article , @entity19 ( left ) , mr @entity20 and mr @entity6 want to set the record straight ' @entity2 's response was , ' i do n't want to , '' @entity20 said			1
'' i do n't want to do that right now			0
i just want to go to bed			0
'' feeling hamstrung by @entity2 's refusal to go to authorities , @entity6 said that days later he sought advice from his dorm 's resident assistant			2
careful not to mention @entity2 by name , so the @entity142 would n't be obligated to contact police , he said he asked if he should call police even though @entity2 did n't want him to			1
@entity6 said the @entity142 told him that he should encourage @entity2 to talk with police , but that @entity6 could n't force her to do so			1
the three friends say they continue to work on correcting the record about what happened that night , and at least one , @entity6 , wonders to what extent he believes the victim 's own version of what happened â€” or whether any discrepancies in her story matter			1
want answers just as much as i do , ' @entity6 says			0
' but if anything , the takeaway from all this is that i still do n't really care if what 's presented in this article is true or not because i think it 's far more important that people focus on the issue of sexual assault as a whole			0
' @entity20 , another friend of @entity2 who spoke to her shortly after she says she was gang raped , claims she said she ' just wanted to go to bed ' other news media have also interviewed the friends , but this is the first time @entity6 has allowed his full name to be used			1
the @entity22 article , published last month , described a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at @entity1			1
the article has roiled the campus and caused a huge backlash , with @entity1			2
suspending fraternity activities until january , the @entity180 appointing an independent investigator to look into the allegations and the university handing the case over to the @entity187 police			0
@entity188 and @entity22 managing editor @entity189 did not respond to an email from @entity25 on sunday morning seeking comment			0
none of the three friends was contacted by @entity22 's reporter , @entity188 , before the article was published ; each of them rejected multiple assertions made in the article , for which @entity22 has since apologized for and noted discrepancies			2
all three say @entity188 has since reached out to them , and that she has told them she is re-reporting the story			0
@entity19 told the @entity25 that @entity188 apologized to her for portraying her the way she did			0
a lawyer representing the victim , who has been identified only as ' @entity2 , ' has declined several requests by the @entity25 to interview @entity2 and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article .			2
