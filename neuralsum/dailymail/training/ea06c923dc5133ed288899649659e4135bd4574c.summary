by @entity0 the @entity1 took a 3 - 1 lead in the @entity3 with another comfortable 107 - 86 road win over @entity5 on thursday , closing within one victory of avenging last year 's loss to the @entity5			1
@entity8 had 20 points and 14 rebounds for the @entity1 , who can win their fifth @entity3 championship with a victory at home in game 5 on sunday			1
' i 'm pleased that they performed as well as they did while we 've been in @entity5 , and that 's about as far as it goes , ' @entity1 coach @entity16 said			2
' now we 've got to go back home and play as well or better			0
' moving closer : @entity1 forward @entity8 scores as his side win @entity25 @entity27 tried to keep the @entity5 in it with 28 points and eight rebounds , but @entity31 was just 1 of 10 through three quarters and finished with 10 points			1
if the @entity5 are going to win this series , it will take the biggest comeback in @entity3 history			1
no team has overcome a 3 - 1 deficit in the finals , and the way they were outclassed twice on their home floor makes it hard to imagine the two - time champions being the first			0
' this was probably the biggest surprise of the series , ' @entity5 coach @entity46 said			0
@entity50 added 19 points , and @entity52 had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the @entity1 , who shot 57 percent from the field			2
@entity1 lost twice in @entity5 to end last year 's finals , their only defeat in the championship round			1
they won their two games in @entity61 this time by a combined 40 points			0
ca n't bear to watch : @entity27 covers his face as the @entity5 bench their side go down to the @entity1 extending their lead : @entity8 goes for the basket as @entity5 's @entity70 and @entity71 try and defend the past 13 times @entity5 lost a playoff game , they always responded with a victory in the next encounter , but successive losses suggests they might be weary at the end of a fourth - straight season that has gone the distance			1
@entity5 seemed to lack the energy - or maybe effort - to defend @entity1 's precision ball movement for the full 24 seconds , and time after time the @entity1 ended up with a shot from somebody who did n't have a defender nearby			2
the visitors were not quite as sharp as when they shot a finals - record 75.8 percent in the first half tuesday , but they were still good enough to open another huge lead by half - time , and they withstood every attempt @entity5 made to make a run			0
down and out : @entity27 and @entity5 are 3 - 1 down in the series blocked : @entity1 forward @entity52 stops the shot from @entity5 's @entity96 ' we were expecting a reaction from them but we were ready for it , so we just did the same thing , ' @entity1 forward @entity97 said			2
the defense was definitely improved in the first half , holding @entity5 to 12 of 34 ( 35 percent )			0
the @entity1 used a 13 - 2 spurt to open a nine - point lead , and that was the margin when they went to the second ahead 26 - 17			0
@entity1 got the first five of the second to make it 31 - 17 on @entity111 's 3 - pointer , and the @entity1 blew it open later in the quarter with seven straight points , capped by @entity8 's soaring follow dunk that made it 55 - 33			1
it was another rough start for @entity27 , who battled cramps in game 1 , then left the court and briefly returned to the locker room midway through the first quarter thursday			0
he had 10 quick points in the third quarter to bring @entity5 within 13 , but @entity1 got a basket from @entity52 to start a 7 - 0 run that pushed it to 68 - 48			1
the @entity1 poured it on late in the third , pushing the lead to 81 - 57 .			0

@entity8 scores 20 points as @entity1 win in @entity5
@entity1 are just one win away from winning @entity3 championship
spurs could win the title in front of their home fans on sunday
