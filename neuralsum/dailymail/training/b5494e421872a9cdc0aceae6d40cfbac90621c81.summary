by @entity0 cross-eyed : a distorted image of mr @entity2 in an internet parody after he promoted @entity5 cuts to bingo @entity7 chairman @entity2 came under fire from his own party last night over a ‘ patronising ’ advert highlighting @entity5 cuts to bingo and beer duty			1
mr @entity2 suffered a ferocious backlash on @entity13 after posting the advert in an apparent bid to woo working - class voters			1
@entity17 insisted @entity18 had ‘ full confidence ’ in his party chairman , adding : ‘ he thinks he ’s doing a good job			1
’ but some @entity7 @entity22 said the advert – which sparked dozens of internet spoofs yesterday – raised questions about mr @entity2 ’s ‘ suitability ’ for the job			1
as the row threatened to overshadow coverage of the @entity5 , some even suggested it could lead to mr @entity30 being replaced in a reshuffle expected later this year			0
critics said the message reinforced public perceptions that the @entity7 was out of touch with ordinary voters			2
government sources stressed that responsibility for the advert lay with mr @entity2 rather than the @entity40 or no 10			1
one senior @entity7 said : ‘ when i saw this advert my initial thought was that it must be a spoof			1
my reaction when i realised it was n’t was one of abject horror			0
’ another exasperated conservative mp said : ‘ has it boiled down to this ? a @entity2 beer and bingo poster ? @entity50 help us			1
it ’s like they want us to lose			0
’ mr @entity2 urged @entity7 supporters to ‘ spread the word ’			1
one @entity7 source yesterday said the advert had been ‘ pulled ’ and would never be used again			1
but a @entity7 spokesman insisted it had only ever been intended for use on the internet and was never planned as a poster campaign			2
the spokesman said : ‘ we are quite proud of those tax cuts			1
we stand by what was said in that advert			2
‘ there is a misconception about it – it was never going to be a poster campaign , it was just an internet infographic			0
‘ some of the left - wing intelligentsia may not like it but the reaction in bingo halls to the tax cut has been very positive			1
’ @entity95 @entity96 treasury chief secretary @entity96 described the wording of the advert as ‘ pretty patronising ’ and said it ‘ demeans some quite sensible things ’			2
@entity101 added : ‘ i think the tweet was a bit silly , partly because the issues involved in this budget were really quite serious			0
’ @entity107 mayor @entity106 also declined to support the advert			2
‘ i did n’t write the blooming thing , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re trying to get across the message that it ’s a budget for everyone			0
’ shadow chancellor @entity113 said @entity114 must be ‘ frustrated that his head of campaigns puts out an advert patronising working people by saying they ’ll be happy with a bingo tax and a beer tax			1
what nonsense that is ’			0
@entity124 , a writer on political satire @entity125 , said the ad was beyond satire but mr @entity114 dismissed the row , saying it had been ‘ whipped up by the @entity65 ’ to disguise the fact they had nothing to say about the @entity5			0
mr @entity114 said he had played bingo			0
the prime minister ’s spokesman said he did not know when mr @entity18 had last played bingo – or if he had ever played it at all			0
however , he is known to enjoy a pint of real ale			0
the internet was last night awash with spoof versions of mr @entity2 ’s advert , which mock it for stereotyping the working class			1
one posted on @entity13 reads : ‘ bingo ! no tax on pies , flat caps or whippets – keeping our commitment to patronise the working class			2
now get off my land			0
’ another says : ‘ bingo ! i say , you there ! how is your whippet ? jolly good , jolly good			0

party chairman @entity2 tweeted beer and bingo tax cuts advert
it said @entity162 cuts helped ' hardworking people ' do what ' they ' enjoy
@entity166 was immediately slammed as a ' pr disaster ' and ' ill - conceived '
some @entity7 *mps* said advert raised questions about his ' suitability ' for job
