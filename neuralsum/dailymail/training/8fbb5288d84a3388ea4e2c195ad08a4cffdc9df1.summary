by @entity0 published : 20:29 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 20:30 est , 4 december 2013 a secret court ruling in which a judge allowed doctors to sedate a pregnant woman to perform a caesarean without her consent was made public for the first time yesterday			1
the extraordinary document shows how a judge approved an @entity12 trust ’s plan			0
a transcript of the hearing shows how mr @entity15 , who made the order , told the court : ‘ she should not know about this order before she is taken and goes to hospital			1
’ the woman ’s legally appointed representative replied : ‘ my lord , if it assists , it would be perfectly appropriate to include in the terms of the order that the substance of it shall not be communicated to the patient until after			0
if she disagrees with it she can apply afterwards to discharge it			0
’ grief : @entity36 , who was forced to have her baby delivered by caesarean section and then removed from her by @entity40 social services the judge replied : ‘ yes , that is right			2
so in those circumstances it is appropriate			0
’ he also authorised the use of ‘ reasonable and proportionate force ’ if needed			0
mr @entity15 , sitting in the secretive @entity47 , which makes decisions for incapacitated people , ruled the caesarean was in the woman ’s best interests and that she was too mentally ill to make the decision herself			2
but he said it would be ‘ heavy - handed ’ for police to take her baby at birth and suggested social workers should make a legal application to take the newborn into care instead			2
within 24 hours of his ruling , doctors operated to deliver 35 - year - old @entity67 ’s baby and the girl was taken into care without her consent , prompting international outrage			1
her lawyers have launched a legal action in a bid to try to get her daughter back and have said the mother - of - three suffers from a relatively minor mental illness , a bipolar condition that can be treated with medication			1
the hearing took place in private , but the judge made the transcript and his ruling public yesterday , saying he wanted to ‘ inform and clarify recent public comments about this case ’			0
mr @entity15 , sitting in the secretive @entity47 , which makes decisions for incapacitated people , ruled the caesarean was in the woman ¿ s best interests miss @entity36 can be named for the first time after a high court judge said she was ‘ perfectly entitled to identify herself as a person who feels wronged ’			1
mr justice @entity96 granted @entity97 an injunction banning the media from identifying the child , who is now 15 months old , or those caring for her			1
but he stopped short of banning the publication of the mother ’s name , saying she was ‘ seeking to make assertions to the effect that she has been unlawfully , wrongly and badly treated ’			2
she has already been named in the @entity112 media			1
it emerged during the hearing at the @entity115 in @entity116 that the toddler had been placed with ‘ prospective adopters ’ — a further blow for her mother			0
earlier , her @entity112 lawyer , @entity121 , said no formal adoption had been agreed and the mother hoped to have her child returned			1
‘ she is strong , she has work , she has a job , she has a house , she has a normal life , ’ says mr @entity121			0
‘ there is absolutely no reason not to allow this woman to have a second chance			0
’ it also emerged that the @entity112 government has instructed solicitors and may want to intervene in the case			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
