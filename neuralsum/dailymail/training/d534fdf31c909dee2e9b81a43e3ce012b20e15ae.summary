@entity2 , a resident of @entity15 who works for @entity5 , published a deeply personal essay titled ' to my ex-wife : i wish i would have held you tighter ' as part of @entity20 ' new relationship series			1
last month , he wrote another piece for the @entity23 paper about cheating , which was read by more than 5million people			1
@entity2 's letter , which lays bare the anatomy of his relationship and eventual breakup , has left readers divided , with some praising the young divorcee for his candor while other questioning his motives and accusing him of being self - indulgent			1
the long - form essay provides an overview of the couple 's relationship from the time they met at age 18 until their divorce			1
‘ i never imagined you and i , out of all the people in this world , would go through something so devastating as we did , ’ @entity42 writes in the opening of the letter addressed simply ‘ to my ex-wife			1
’ ‘ throughout the years , we created the most beautiful memories			1
we climbed all the way to the top together , only to slip and fall as soon as we got there			1
and though i may have contributed to that fall , i tried so hard to hold on to you			1
’ the 29 - year - old writer is vague on what precipitated the split , only saying that he had done things he is not proud of and that he can not undo			1
and although @entity59 writes that losing his wife ’s love shattered his heart into a million pieces , he let her go to find her true happiness			1
retracing his steps in their failed relationship , @entity59 says in the letter that all he ever wanted in life was to fall in love , get married and settle down in a beautiful home with a little bundle of joy			1
‘ i guess it goes without saying that you made all of that feel real for me ; you helped make most of those dreams come true , ’ he writes			1
‘ i wanted nothing more than to be the best husband , a romantic lover , the most selfless provider , and one day , the world 's best dad			1
‘ you were gone , ’ he writes			1
‘ suddenly , everything that was so familiar about life felt so foreign			1
i was lost without you			1
all i had left were my memories and dreams of us that i knew would never come true			2
’ in the letter , @entity59 says there are things he never had the opportunity to tell his ex-wife during their time together , like how much he loved the way she answered the phone			1
‘ you would say " hey " in this voice that sound so innocent and so loving			2
it always reminded me of the beginning of our relationship and all of the reasons i fell in love with you , ’ he says			2
‘ who would have thought something so simple could be so powerful ? it 's what made you unique			2
’ he also reminisces on how he used to look at his ex-wife and admire her , no matter how she looked at any given moment , losing himself in her ‘ sass ’ and smile			1
‘ whatever flaws you believed you had , i loved — how you 'd look in the mirror and always suck in your stomach ; how you always analyzed every picture we took together and made me delete them , nine times out of ten ; how you 'd pace around on the phone when you were nervous			2
or how about how you hated to be on video ? i noticed everything			2
but i loved it , ’ he gushes			2
in the letter , @entity59 looks back on memorable moments in their long relationship , like a @entity143 ’s day in @entity144 and the day he proposed marriage to her on the beach in @entity147 , presenting her with a blue @entity149 box that had been sitting on his desk for three weeks in anticipation for the perfect moment			2
‘ it was one of the happiest moments of my life , ’ he writes of the moment he got down on one knee in the sand and asked the question			2
‘ when i slipped that ring onto your finger , i was certain it would never come off			2
’ the couple got married june 10 , 2012 , after eight years of dating			1
waxing nostalgic : @entity2 goes through key moments in their relationship , including the day they met at age 18 , a @entity166 in @entity144 , the afternoon on the beach when he proposed and their wedding day ‘ my heart was filled with so many emotions , but i just wanted to hold your hand for the rest of my life , ’ @entity59 writes , reflecting on their wedding day			1
but then something changed , and @entity59 writes that their lives ‘ took different paths			2
’ ‘ our worlds need to fall apart , so we can put them back together the way they were meant to be , ’ he says in the letter			2
‘ there 's nothing more important to me than your happiness , and knowing you have that means the world to me			2
’ the @entity4 man writes that after their divorce , he threw himself into work , found a new passion for writing and has been busy piecing back together his life			1
while @entity59 is currently single , he has not given up on love			2
‘ i still dream of having a family			2
i still dream of holding my own child			0
of course , i still dream of falling in love and finding my true happiness , ’ he says			0
the 29 - year - old recent divorcee makes a vow to never let hatred or anger taint his feelings towards his ex-wife and her family , whose high expectations he had failed to meet			1
@entity2 , an aspiring writer , published the letter as part of @entity20 ' series on relationships ' my heart shattered into a million pieces			1
eventually , i realized i could n't save us			0
' ' our life together — it was like @entity93			0
we ran carefree in this theme park we call life			0
holding each others ' hands , we laughed , cried , loved , and we were in awe of everything we experienced			0
we were children with dreams , and together , we thought about the day when all of ours would come true			0
' eventually , though , those roller coasters stopped			0
' the music died down , the lights shut off , and our magical journey came to an abrupt halt			0
' ' whatever flaws you believed you had , i loved — how you 'd look in the mirror and always suck in your stomach ; how you always analyzed every picture we took together and made me delete them , nine times out of ten ; how you 'd pace around on the phone when you were nervous			0
or how about how you hated to be on video ? i noticed everything			0
' ' our worlds need to fall apart , so we can put them back together the way they were meant to be			0
' ' as for me ? i 'm happy			0
i am busier than ever with work , i found a new passion with writing , and i 've been rebuilding a life that was once in a million pieces			0
i still dream of having a family			0
i still dream of holding my own child			0
of course , i still dream of falling in love and finding my true happiness			0
' ' i 'll never hate you , and i 'll never be dishonest about my emotions			0
@entity267 gave me this amazing opportunity to love			0
it brought me to so many beautiful places , taught me so much about life and gave me memories i 'll cherish forever			0
how can i ever be angry about that ? ' ' if i knew then what i know now , i would have held you tighter during our first dance and picked a song that never ended			0
' source : @entity20 he concludes the letter by apologizing for anything he may have done to hurt his former paramour , with whom he had wanted to spend a lifetime			1
‘ if i knew then what i know now , i would have held you tighter during our first dance and picked a song that never ended , ’ he writes touchingly			0

i lost a piece of me that i will never get back , ’ he concludes			0
‘ take good care of it			0
’ @entity2 's deeply personal , emotionally honest love letter to his former spouse has left readers split			1
‘ as i read this i found myself within your story , feeling your joy , sadness , shattered life , hope and strength , ’ @entity298 wrote in the story 's comments			0
in a column for @entity310 , @entity308 excoriated @entity59 for writing the letter , calling it ‘ not only a selfish move , but an aggressive one , with no regard for the ex 's feelings			0
‘ regardless , this column is not about the ex , it is about @entity2 's pathetic narcissism			1
’ in an interview with @entity322 following the publication of the letter , the 29 - year - old @entity3 resident explained that he decided to pen the essay to find closure and clear the air betwee him and his ex after a period of animosity			1
he also insisted that the first - person account was not his attempt to get back together with his former spouse , who is with someone else now			0
