by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ as @entity4 prepare to present @entity5 to the media for the first time at @entity8 on thursday afternoon , the flashing cameras and assembled press will eagerly await the first sound bites from the famously confrontational @entity10			1
@entity11 is expected to reveal his blueprint for @entity4 ’s present and future and @entity15 can reveal a fascinating glimpse into the core principles that have guided him in a prestigious career that has boasted stints with @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
a fortnight before the @entity24 , @entity11 took to the stage in his native @entity26 , addressing an audience of business experts at ‘ @entity29 ’ – the @entity30 – where he outlined his coaching vision			1
when i say that , i mean my vision , and my structure			1
yes , that is arrogant			1
i bet you hear that more , that people find me arrogant			1
it does not bother me			2
but i do believe in my vision			1
so the people who work in my organization have something to hold on to			2
that is what i believe in			2
' ' i see chances because i believe in preparation			2
that is half the job			2
my mum used to say that			2
and she only went to primary school			2
but she knew that ! you do n’t think i would be standing here without preparing ? training			2
in football that is normal			2
is it normal in a company			0
you recruit people and do you train them to create the best product ? i do that ! i train them every day			0
i go over certain things every day			0
i do training , analysis and evaluation			0
that is what i believe in			0
' visionary : @entity11 refuted claims that he is arrogant but did concede that he has a clear idea of what he wants be prepared : the new @entity4 manager is big on everyone knowing their roles ' i ca n’t do it on my own			1
because i do n’t know everything , do i ? i know you start laughing , because i am portrayed continuously that i do know everything			0
i listen to specialists ? do you listen to your employees ? they produce your stuff			0
' look here : the coaches , these are my staff			1
if i go back to what i believe in : preparation , training , analysis , evaluation , than it all comes down to the use of my organisation ! i have 12 members of staff who are working for me , who are preparing , training , analysing and evaluating for me			1
but i am the one who has to guide them , steer them in the right direction			0
' we have two assistant coaches and a goalkeeper coach			0
so , including me as head coach , that is a group of four staff members who are just focusing on skills and tactics			1
and i have a total of 12 , including all the others , physiologists , video analysts , etc. this is how important it is to work in my organisation so i can get the best product possible on the pitch			0
all together , there are 37 people in my staff			1
the leader : despite listening to his staff and delegating , ultimately @entity11 is still the boss ' when i became national coach , the whole world thought i was going to pick the players who had to get us to the @entity24			1
no ! first the staff ! i always first pick my staff ! i have to surround myself with good staff			1
we have to surround the players with quality staff			1
why ? it does not matter whether is a product , a tool , a machine , or knowledge you want to pass on to a big public , i always make sure that i have specialists in every department who advise me			0
' ' almost always i follow the advice of the specialists in my organisation			0
almost always , as i am still the boss and i take the decisions			1
when you look at all the figures , my staff , and you add the number of players in the squad , than it comes usually to 60 people i am working with on a daily basis			1
by vision on the football process			2
' vision is not just about the game			2
my vision also stands for my vision on each person , on society , on the way i speak			2
my tone of voice , if i leave gaps in between my sentences			0
there is always a reason for that			0
it always comes back to my football team			0
' management team : @entity11 with one of his valued staff members , his assistant @entity192 @entity10 master : @entity11 smiles for the camera as he starts his new role as @entity4 manager ' a team with tactics with a triangle shape midfield , with the point in the direction of the defence			1
when i saw the @entity10 squad players for the first time two years ago , i showed them something			1
and why ? because it was something that could bind us			0
' we are all in this for the same reason , we are engaged with the game			0
so i showed them @entity22 , who play with the triangle midfield with the point directing to the defence , one controlling midfielder , that is how they play			0
but they do n’t have a real striker			0
they have a different kind of striker			0
well , ok , that is ( @entity225 ) @entity224 , indeed , a very different striker			0
video : @entity5 reveals his management secrets ( in @entity10 ) ' but i had something to say about that to my players			1
i prefer to have a real striker in my team			0
not a false no 9 , which is @entity224 ( crowd laughs , @entity11 smiles ) : " i do n’t mean anything with that … "			1
so i also showed the players @entity239			2
otherwise the players would say : " yes boss , but how can we adapt to a new system when we only meet up 8 times a season for a couple of days ? " well they ’d be right saying that			1
' so i showed them the @entity239 national team , they play like that			0
the boys in my squad knew from day one what the vision of @entity11 stood for			1
i was clear to them			0
i made sure there was transparency			0
you always have to be transparent ! ' video @entity4 sign record shirt deal			1

@entity11 gave a talk before leading @entity26 at @entity24
' i am not arrogant *...* but i do have a vision , ' insists new @entity4 boss
@entity11 reveals he always chooses his staff before picking players
