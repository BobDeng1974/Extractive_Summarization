by @entity1 reporter published : 21:38 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 19 july 2013 a teenager banished from the insulated world of the @entity4 has spoken about how his life has dramatically changed since being forced out of the polygamous sect			1
@entity8 , 19 , together with his parents and six sisters were among a group of between 500 and 600 people banished by the sect ’s leader - and so - called prophet - @entity15 , who has spent the past seven years behind bars after being convicted of sexual abuse of young girls			1
the @entity8 family received help of a group called @entity22 , a nonprofit for those leaving polygamist groups			1
write caption here @entity8 was placed with a couple called @entity27 and @entity28 , who have helped him to reclaim his lost childhood and experience a number of things for the first time - including his first ride on a rollercoaster , his first birthday cake and even @entity36			1
like most boys in the @entity5 , @entity8 was pulled out of grade school to work and so he has also had to learn to read for the first time			1
@entity8 's life also took an unexpected turn in june , when he met a photographer who believed he had model potential and invited him to a photo shoot			1
the invitation to become a model shows just how far @entity8 's physical and emotional transformation has come since leaving the sect			1
@entity8 , left with his back to the camera , visits the spot where several of his friends died in a car crash after a beer party ‘ someone saw me for who i was and singled me out and picked me because of that , ’ @entity8 told @entity55			1
‘ all my life [ @entity60 ] never believed in myself			2
it was so easy for me to get lost in the crowd of family , but out here it 's so easy to be seen in a crowd and not get lost			0
’ @entity8 is one of the lucky ones			1
just weeks after he left several of his close friends died in a car crash after a beer party			1
under the @entity5 ' strict religious code , boys and girls are forbidden from speaking to one another in their community and so many attend the secret desert parties			1
‘ there 's a reason the young boys go out at night , and the young girls go to those parties , ’ he told @entity75			1
under the @entity5 ' strict religious code women are forced to wear long - sleeved prairie dresses and are n't allowed to cut their hair @entity8 has joined @entity36 since leaving the @entity5 and has posted several pictures of his adventures since ' it 's because they can drink , they can be themselves and they can put away all that stress			1
’ according to church teachings , anyone who attends these parties becomes a ‘ son of perdition			2
’ ‘ son of perdition means you are @entity98 's property , and that you will burn in hell when you leave this life for what you have done , ’ @entity8 explained			2
the community lives a lifestyle far removed from the modern world with no internet , no television and little contact with the outside world			0
every aspect of life - what people wear , what they eat , even whom they marry - continues to be controlled by @entity15 , even though he is behind bars			0
some of is more recent bizarre edicts have included banning toys , bicycles and the eating of corn			0
criminal : @entity15 continues to run his ' church ' from behind bars after being imprisoned for sexual assault on a 15 and 12 - year - old cult : @entity15 was said to have been married to an estimated 80 women as he lead the polygamous sect the community , which has up to 10,000 members worldwide , still believes in their ' prophet ' even though he is serving life plus 20 years for sexually abusing children			1
approximately 8,000 people still reside at the @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 and they are still reportedly receiving instructions from him			0
' we know he is innocent , ' dr. @entity139 , primary health care provider at the @entity135 , told @entity55			0
' and we all yearn for his deliverance , ' she added			0
when questioned about why @entity15 is still allowed to give guidance from the jail cell , officials say there is little they can do			0
' if somebody comes in and visits with him , and he gives them instructions and they take them back by word of mouth , there ’s just nothing we can do to control that , ' @entity149 , director of public information at the @entity150 , told @entity55			0
shocking : members of the sect are escorted onto a bus in @entity136 , @entity137 after a raid on a compound built by @entity15 , jailed leader of @entity5 followers of the movement had also congregated in sites in @entity168 , @entity169 , and @entity170 , @entity171			2
@entity169 's attorney general @entity172 in february announced a criminal probe of the @entity5 and the @entity174 , which serves as a small police force in the twin polygamous towns @entity170 and @entity168			2
a highly publicized raid in 2008 on the sect 's community - the @entity135 compound in @entity136 , @entity137 - revealed to the world for the first time the society @entity15 had been developing			2
the move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in @entity192 history			0
pictures showing members ' unusual appearance , particularly of the women in the community who wear restrictive floor length dresses and are forbidden from cutting their hair , were broadcast across the world as 400 children were put in temporary custody for the duration of the police investigation into sexual abuse			2
the @entity5 temple at the @entity135 near @entity136 , @entity137 during his trial , jurors wept as they heard a graphic tape of the twisted sexual instructions @entity15 gave his brides - some of whom were just children			0
he warned @entity218 would reject them if they did not to submit to his instructions and dna evidence presented during the trial proved he had fathered a child with a 15 - year - old girl			0
' if the world knew what i was doing , they would hang me from the highest tree , ' @entity15 wrote in a chilling journal entry from 2005 - one of thousands of pages of notes seized by authorities			0
he was given life behind bars for one count of aggravated sexual assault and an extra 20 years , to be served consecutively , for the second count of sexual assault - the maximum allowed for each count .			0
