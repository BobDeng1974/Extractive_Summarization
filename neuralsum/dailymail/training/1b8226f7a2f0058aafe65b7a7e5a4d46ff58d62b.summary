@entity1 boss @entity0 insists there is no point in @entity5 ' sulking ' about his recent @entity7 snub			1
the in - form youngster was selected in @entity10 's squad for the @entity12 qualifier against @entity13 and friendly against @entity14			1
however , he ended up kicking his heels on the bench for both games rather than getting his senior debut , with tried - and - tested veteran @entity19 even preferred as a late substitute at @entity21			2
@entity5 and @entity22 watch @entity7 take on @entity13 from the substitutes bench at @entity24 @entity0 believes @entity5 will still benefit from the experience and hopes the forward reacts positively to the disappointment			1
' there 's certainly no benefit to sulking , ' said the @entity1 head coach			2
' he has to look at the last two weeks as a great experience - one that helps him to become a better player			0
if that helps him to raise his game to another level , then fantastic			2
' we will get the benefit of that and ultimately @entity5 will as well			1
' it is vitally important he has learnt a lot in these last two weeks and that helps him make the progress he needs to continue to make			0
@entity5 was called up to the national squad for the first time but did n't make an appearance @entity5 's form for both @entity7 's @entity49 side and @entity1 earned him the call - up @entity0 said there was no point @entity5 sulking ' he knows he has a lot to do to continue to develop to become a regular at that level			1
i really hope this will give his season yet another boost			0
' @entity0 has not had chance to gauge @entity5 's mood since returning			1
' i 've not had time to have a chat with him yet , ' said the @entity64			0
' he came back really pleased to have been away and looking hungry to continue his development			0
he may be disappointed that he did not get on but it will certainly benefit him			2
' it is vital he learns from the experience and that all helps him become even better and get even more of a taste of @entity7 in the future			1
' asked whether @entity5 's call - up will help convince the player his international ambitions can be achieved at a so - called smaller club and ultimately keep him at @entity77 , @entity0 said : ' i am not sure if it strengthens it or not but it is certainly fantastic for the club and the lad			1
' it is great for him to be recognised in this way , he needs to learn from the experience and become better			0
' i can not see any negatives at all about him going away and being a part of it - and that includes him not playing			0
' he has had a couple of weeks of working with those players and living with those players and he would be missing an opportunity if he did n't take an awful lot from that			0

@entity5 was called up for the recent @entity7 squad for games against @entity13 and @entity14
but @entity10 did not play @entity5 in either game
@entity0 said there is no point sulking no matter how disappointed he is
