by @entity0 published : 13:58 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 16:51 est , 11 october 2012 a @entity2 politician personally endorsed by vice presidential candidate @entity3 is today at the centre of a storm after a controversial interview emerged in which he relayed his father 's advice that ' some girls rape easy			1
' desperately trying to control the damage , @entity12 state rep. @entity11 , claimed that repeating his father 's comments were meant as a warning that a woman could agree to sex but then later claim it was n't consensual			1
however , the backlash has been severe , with @entity2 vice presidential candidate @entity3 announcing today he was withdrawing his support for the embattled representative who is running for re-election			1
@entity2 state rep. @entity11 said his comments relaying advice his father gave him that ' some girls rape easy ' have been taken out of context @entity11 , 60 , who is married with six adult children , including four daughters and nine grand - children was first quoted making his rape comments in a december story published by the @entity35			1
he was discussing the case of @entity37 , a 17 - year - old high school senior who was charged with sexual assault in @entity12 for having sex with an underage girl in the school 's band room			1
but yesterday @entity11 told the @entity43 that the original article did not provide the full context of his father 's comments and that his exact words were different			1
' he also told me one thing , ' if you do ( have premarital sex ) , just remember , consensual sex can turn into rape in an awful hurry , ' said @entity11 to the @entity43			1
@entity2 state rep. @entity11 had enjoyed the backing of vice-presidential candidate @entity3 until today ' because all of a sudden a young lady gets pregnant and the parents are madder than a wet hen and she 's not going to say , ' oh , yeah , i was part of the program			1
' ' all that she has to say or the parents have to say is it was rape because she 's underage			0
and he just said , ' remember , @entity11 , if you go down that road , some girls , ' he said , ' they rape so easy			0
' however , today on the eve of his debate with vice president @entity75 , @entity2 vice-presidential candidate @entity3 withdrew his support for @entity11 in the wake of his rape comments			1
' state representative @entity11 's comments are outrageous and offensive , ' @entity3 's congressional campaign spokesman @entity79 said in a statement			1
' congressman @entity3 believes there is no place in our discourse for rhetoric such as this			0
' congressman @entity3 can not support mr. @entity11 or his indefensible comments			1
' @entity11 's @entity91 opponent @entity90 called the comments offensive			2
' i 'm offended to think that my sister or my daughters would be thought of in that manner , ' said @entity90			0
' i feel @entity11 is out of touch with the majority of voters and his views are extreme			0
' @entity11 claimed that he was trying to reference the fact that in @entity12 the age of consent is 18 years old for couples who are not married			1
it is illegal to have sex with someone under age 18 in @entity12 , and that has caused controversy at times when two teenagers are involved in a sexual relationship			2
some in the state have argued for a so - called ' @entity115 ' legislation that would reduce or eliminate penalties for minors close in age who have sex , but @entity11 has never specifically endorsed such legislation			1
three hours after he gave what he assumed was a clarification of his rape comments , @entity11 contacted the @entity43 to try to smooth over what he said with a statement in which he called rape a horrible act of violence that unfortunately often goes unreported to police			2
the @entity2 politician @entity11 has caused a storm reminiscent to the one created by @entity131 who made condemned comments about legitimate rape and women 's bodies in august ' sexual assault is a crime that unfortunately is misunderstood and my comments have the potential to be misunderstood as well , ' his statement said			1
' rape is a horrible act of violence			0
sexual assault unfortunately often goes unreported to police			0
' i have four daughters and three granddaughters and i understand the importance of making sure that awareness of this crime is taken very seriously			0
' rivards original comments were made 10 - months ago in december but have resurfaced during the @entity2 's tight race in @entity12 against @entity154 @entity90			1
@entity90 claims that he did not know of the comments until august around the time that @entity157 rep. @entity131 of @entity158 caused a national outrage for claiming that women 's bodies could prevent pregnancy in cases of ' legitimate rape			0
' @entity131 , a nominee for @entity165 in @entity158 , told the @entity166 that it was rare for a woman to become pregnant after being raped because the ' female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down '			0
' @entity173 , from what i understand from doctors , ( pregnancy from rape ) is really rare , ' the @entity2 stalwart told @entity179			0
' if it ’s a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down			0
' he went on to say : ' but let ’s assume that maybe that did n’t work or something			0
i think there should be some punishment , but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child			0
' many were in disbelief that someone could present such an argument as the @entity2 senate hopeful attempted to explain his no - exception rule when it comes to abortion			2
@entity131 was elected to the @entity201 in 1988			0
he is a vocal anti-abortion campaigner with no exceptions for rape or incest			0
at the time president @entity205 attacked @entity131 's comments and @entity207 and @entity3 both urged @entity131 to drop out of his race for the @entity165 , but so far he has ignored their calls			2
alone : following aspiring @entity158 senator @entity131 's repellent comments on rape , his fellow @entity2 have turned on him president @entity205 called mr @entity131 's statements on rape and abortion ' offensive ' and ' way out there ' on monday , and said politicians should not be making healthcare decisions on behalf of women			2
' rape is rape and the idea that we should be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we are talking about does n't make sense to the @entity157 people and certainly does n't make sense to me , ' said the president to reporters in the @entity235 briefing room back in august @entity207 said he has ' an entirely different view ' than mr @entity131 's , calling the candidate 's comments ' offensive			2
' the @entity2 presidential candidate also called on @entity131 to correct his statements			2
@entity2 gov. @entity242 , who had also endorsed @entity11 , condemned the lawmaker 's comments , as did @entity245 @entity157 rep. @entity245			1
@entity245 had not endorsed @entity11 but had received a $ 500 campaign donation from him			2
@entity245 said he would donate the $ 500 to the @entity247 in @entity248			0
opposition : president @entity205 chimed in calling @entity131 's sentiment ' way out there ' distance : @entity2 @entity207 said monday that @entity131 's comments on rape are ' insulting , inexcusable , and , frankly , wrong ' @entity254 , president of the @entity255 , said @entity11 's comments portray women as perpetrators of violence against them			1
' he 's blaming the victim and implying the definition of rape is all too encompassing , ' she said			0
@entity263 , interim executive director of the @entity264 , said in a statement that @entity11 's comments show people in @entity12 need to be better educated about sexual violence			1
' unfortunately , comments like these are all too common , and an indication of ways in which the culture is generally under educated about what sexual assault is ; sexual assault remains an under - reported and under prosecuted crime , ' her statement said .			0

@entity12 state representative @entity11 made the comments in an interview last year when asked about an underage sex case involving a 17 - year - old boy
@entity11 had *previously* been endorsed by @entity2 vice-presidential candidate @entity3 - who today removed his backing calling the comments ' indefensible '
