it was a night to forget for @entity1 as @entity2 advanced to the @entity4 semi-final and out - of - sorts winger @entity6 was sent off for pulling at referee @entity8 's shirt			1
despite @entity9 levelling with his head after @entity12 's opener , the night belonged to former @entity1 striker @entity13 , who sealed the @entity15 ' victory with a beautifully composed finish			1
here , @entity18 's @entity17 rates every player 's performance at @entity21			2

exposed brutally by @entity29 when @entity13 raced through to score			1
pulled off a couple of world class saves towards the end			2
7.5 @entity1 goalkeeper @entity25 had a solid game but was exposed for @entity2 's second goal @entity36 : powered forward with lung - busting run for @entity1 equaliser			1
dreadful , dreadful back pass for @entity2 ’s second			1
6.5 @entity41 : solid without every really imposing himself			2
has taken it upon himself to marshall back four			2
6.5 @entity45 : rock solid			2
is he turning into @entity1 ’s best defender ? granted , not a great deal of competition , but he is playing well			2
7 despite the loss @entity45 was one of @entity1 's top performers with some solid defending @entity52 : at the mercy of @entity55 ’s half - time tactical switch			2
was neither good nor bad			2
seemed a bit unfortunate to be hooked			2
6.5 @entity57 : hard to work out exactly what @entity58 is asking him to do in there			2
just seems to spend the entire game chasing after the ball			0

@entity94 has to find a way to win it			0
breathtaking take down just before half time from @entity80 chip			0
7 @entity1 striker @entity9 heads home the equaliser against @entity2 at @entity21 @entity99 : @entity100 ( @entity52 46 ) : did n’t know whether to stay or go when @entity101 or @entity13 dropped off			1
6 @entity79 ( @entity75 46 ) : @entity103 nice touches in midfield			0

3 @entity72 makes the long walk towards the @entity21 tunnel after being sent off @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity124 : very little to do apart from @entity69 ’s goal , which he had no chance of doing anything to stop			1
7 @entity129 : early booking , cleaned out @entity89			0
disciplinary tight - rope after that trying to stop the @entity1 winger 7 per mertesacker : @entity133 exposed when @entity69 scored , just seemed to switch off			2
7 per @entity135 ( right ) and @entity136 allowed @entity69 the space to head home @entity1 's equaliser @entity136 : @entity69 for the @entity1 equaliser , allowed him to squeeze in to space behind him			2
7.5 @entity12 : showed ambition down the left when he kept on running after exchanging passes with @entity101 in build up to goal			1
7 @entity12 slips the ball past the oncoming @entity1 goalkeeper @entity25 ( right ) @entity88 : screening job in front of @entity2 ’s back four , rarely left his post			1
7.5 @entity88 showed he is an indispensable player for @entity152 after a solid midfield performance @entity154 : switched roles when @entity156 came on , playing in a more advanced position			0
7 @entity158 : lovely , jinking run for the opening goal			0
@entity2 ’s best player until he pinged left hamstring			1

8 @entity204 - @entity8 : @entity205 , one of best performances of season in this field			0
character to send off @entity72 and it was the correct call			0

@entity12 opened the scoring and @entity9 equalised but @entity13 's finish earned him the *plaudits*
