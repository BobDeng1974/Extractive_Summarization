by @entity0 @entity3 had the means to prevent his ex-wife @entity5 entering the @entity6 , her friends suggested in extraordinary claims revealed today			1
the tv chef was stopped from boarding a flight at @entity10 on sunday , apparently as a result of comments she made about taking drugs in evidence during an unrelated court case			1
but now , astonishingly , it has been alleged that mr @entity3 could have had the connections to deny her entry to the @entity6 - even if he did not use them - thanks to his family links to the @entity23 campaign			1
claim : @entity3 ( left ) allegedly had the means to prevent ex-wife @entity5 ( right ) entering the @entity6 mr @entity3 , 70 , has a connection to @entity26 , who was appointed @entity6 ambassador in @entity10 by president @entity23 last year , reported @entity28 of the @entity30 ’s @entity29			1
mr @entity26 has been a @entity31 activist for many years - and the 43 - year - old was an important fundraiser for the campaign to get mr @entity23 elected in 2008 , organising huge events			1
also involved in the @entity23 campaign as a manager was 29 - year - old @entity38 - mr @entity3 ’s @entity37 - educated nephew , who founded the private social network @entity40			1
a source told the @entity30 : ‘ we do n’t know that @entity43 was behind this , but he certainly has the means and the contacts to do it			1
links : mr @entity3 reportedly has a connection to @entity26 ( pictured ) , 43 , who was appointed @entity27 in @entity10 by president @entity23 last year ‘ @entity5 ’s friends can not understand why she was specifically targeted , unless somebody , like her ex-husband , had tipped off the @entity6 authorities			1
’ ' we do n’t know that @entity43 was behind this , but he certainly has the means and the contacts to do it ' source at the trial of her and mr @entity3 's personal assistants last year , the self - styled ‘ domestic goddess ’ admitted taking cocaine , and said her former husband was on a campaign to ' ruin me in any way '			1
there is no evidence that mr @entity3 in fact used his contacts to prevent miss @entity5 ’s entry to the @entity6 , or that any of the named contacts would have been willing to help him with this			2
the @entity6 embassy in @entity10 said yesterday that following miss @entity5 being prevented from flying to @entity77 , she had now been invited to apply for a visa and promised the matter could be ‘ handled routinely and expeditiously ’			1
relative : @entity38 ( pictured ) , 29 , mr @entity3 's @entity37 - educated nephew , was involved in the 2008 @entity23 campaign as a manager and founded the private social network company @entity40 admission : at the trial of @entity86 and mr @entity3 's personal assistants @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) last year , the self - styled ' domestic goddess ' admitted taking cocaine during the trial last december , the mother - of - two told jurors she took the class a drug twice - once with her late husband @entity96 when he found out he had terminal cancer and again in 2010 when she claimed she was being ‘ subjected to intimate terrorism ’ by mr @entity3			1
before the trial @entity100 feel that i have clearly been a disappointment to @entity5 during the last year or so ' ( 2013 ) @entity102 ’ll go quiet when he explodes and then i am a nest of horrible festeringness ' ( 2007 ) during the trial @entity105 ' i was not gripping , strangling or throttling her			1
i was holding her head by the neck to make her focus , can we be clear ? ' ‘ i adore @entity5 now			2
i absolutely adore @entity5 and i ’m broken - hearted to have lost her ’ @entity112 said to me if i did n't go back and clear his name he would destroy me ... i felt his way of getting things out was to use this case ' ' it comes after a long summer of bullying and abuse and i find it another chapter in that ' after the trial saatchi'the truth is that she was taking illegal drugs secretly throughout the last few years of our marriage , often with her own child when she was far too young to even smoke or drink ' @entity136 have not only your private life , but distortions of your private life , put on display is mortifying ' ' there are people going through an awful lot worse and to dwell on any of it would be self - pity ' but she told the court : ‘ i have never been a drug addict			1
i 've never been a habitual user			0
’ miss @entity5 , 54 , had also said during the trial that she had endured bullying and abuse within her marriage , and believed mr @entity3 was using the case to air grievances			1
an eyewitness told the @entity150 that miss @entity5 attempted to board a @entity152 flight from @entity10 on sunday morning but was turned away			1
‘ she did n't seem to say much but she did not look happy , ’ the onlooker said			0
‘ she could not get on the flight so she had to turn around and leave			0
’ legal experts said miss @entity5 could have been unfortunate because her fame had drawn attention to what she said about drugs			2
however , miss @entity5 has visited @entity6 since the sensational court appearance			2
she appeared on @entity6 tv show @entity161 to promote her show the taste but also spoke at length about the trial of @entity89 and @entity88			0
the @entity165 had been accused of fraudulently using company credit cards , spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on designer goods for themselves while working as personal assistants to the celebrity couple			0
but the @entity172 sisters claimed every purchase had been approved by their then - bosses and they were found not guilty after jurors deliberated for nine hours			0
miss @entity5 told @entity176 's @entity161 that having details of her acrimonious split from millionaire art dealer mr @entity3 discussed in court under the glare of the world 's media was ‘ mortifying ’			1
comment requests were left today with mr @entity3 ’s spokesman and the @entity186			0
passage blocked : @entity5 could have been unlucky because her fame had drawn attention to the comments in court about drugs lawyer @entity193 , who specialises in @entity6 immigration law , said @entity5 could have been unlucky because her fame had drawn attention to the comments in court about drugs			2
she explained : ‘ in order to travel to the @entity199 without a visa on the visa waiver programme one has to obtain @entity202 ( electronic system for travel authorisation ) authorisation			0
‘ as part of that one has to answer questions about whether one has been arrested or convicted for an offence involving moral turpitude or in relation to a controlled substance			0
someone in ms @entity5 's circumstances could tick no. ‘ but the problem comes when one also has to answer a question as to whether you are a drug abuser or addict			2
the question of who is a drug user is a difficult one and is supposed to be directed by regulations set out by the @entity224 in @entity225			0
‘ typically any person who has used drugs within the last year can be considered a drug abuser or addict			2
it could be because she is unlucky enough to be famous and her admission of drug use made the newspapers			0
‘ it could be that someone said “ hey , if she has used illegal drugs in the past year she could be classed as a drug abuser ”			2
’ ms @entity193 explained that if this was the case , there were a series of steps which must be taken before miss @entity5 would be allowed back into the @entity199			0
she would first be advised to visit a doctor who holds a contract with the @entity6 embassy in @entity10 who would carry out an assessment to see whether or not she could be classed under these terms			0
if the doctor says she should be free to travel she could obtain a visa in a number of weeks , ms @entity193 said			0
police reviewed the allegations of drug use which emerged during the trial but @entity256 said no further action would be taken			0
so while miss @entity5 has not been convicted for any drug offence , it appears that @entity6 officials still decided to deny her entrance to the country			0
the @entity6 @entity263 told the @entity150 that foreigners who had admitted drug taking could be deemed ‘ inadmissible ’ .			0

@entity5 was stopped from boarding flight at @entity10 on sunday
it was apparently as a result of comments she made about taking drugs
she also claimed in trial last year @entity43 was out to ' ruin me in any way '
@entity43 has family links to @entity26 , @entity27 in @entity10
mr @entity26 and @entity43 's nephew both involved in 2008 @entity23 campaign
