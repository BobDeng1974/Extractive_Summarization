by @entity0 they are favourite at weddings and dinner parties , but putting chicken liver parfait or pate on the menu carries an increased risk of food poisoning , experts warned today			1
many famous chefs make a point of cooking the livers used in these dishes so they remain pink in the middle - but this does not kill off bugs			1
@entity16 ( @entity17 ) has now issued an official food poisoning alert linking chicken livers to campylobacter , the most common form of food poisoning in the @entity23			1
danger : health experts have warned that most large outbreaks of campylobacter - the most common form of food poisoning in the @entity23 - are from chicken liver dishes such as pate and terrine there are some 60,000 officially recorded cases of campylobacter poisoning each year , but the true number of victims is thought to be more than 600,000 because only a tiny fraction of people go to their doctor			1
most people recover from the symptoms - which include diarrhoea , stomach pains and fever - in a few days , but there can be complications , including paralysis and even death			2
the government watchdog said 80 per cent of campylobacter cases linked to large food poisoning outbreaks , as opposed to individual cases , appear to involve to chicken liver dishes			1
chicken liver pate recipes from chefs such as @entity54 suggest frying the livers and leaving them a little pink in the middle , while recipe suggestions from supermarkets like @entity60 follow the same line			2
however a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ chicken liver parfait / pate dishes have increased in popularity over the last few years and many chefs recommend leaving the centre of the livers pink which does not kill the bacteria			2
‘ our records show that the number of people linked to outbreaks where chicken livers were implicated has risen from eight people in 2000 to 210 in 2013			1
’ the problem stems from the fact that a very high proportion of chicken sold in the @entity23 is contaminated with campylobacter , despite a 10 year programme by the @entity81 and farmers to try and tackle the problem			1
research suggests that two in three chickens sold in supermarkets and butchers is contaminated with campylobacter , with the figure rising to three in four of the chicken reared on @entity23 farms			1
generally , the bug is found on the skin of the bird and is killed during the cooking process , however it can be found inside chicken liver			1
trend : chicken liver pate recipes from chefs such as @entity54 ( pictured ) suggest frying the livers and leaving them a little pink in the middle - but this does not kill campylobacter consequently , if they are not cooked for long enough at a high enough temperature before being turned into pate , the bug will survive			1
@entity17 said many of the outbreaks in recent years have been traced to wedding receptions at hotels , banqueting venues or pubs			0
others were associated with catering at other functions such as hotels , clubs and restaurants			0
last year , a @entity119 hotel was ordered to pay £ 72,000 in fines and costs after 46 guests at a wedding reception fell ill after eating an undercooked chicken liver parfait			0
and two years ago , a five - star @entity126 hotel was fined more than £ 35,000 after guests fell ill from eating a chicken liver parfait served at a @entity131 party			0
the @entity81 has launched @entity132 and is highlighting the dangers of chicken and campylobacter			2
as part of this , it has also warned families against washing raw chickens because this carries the risk of spreading any contamination to other surfaces			0
dr @entity143 , head of the gastrointestinal diseases department at @entity17 , said : ‘ we welcome this campaign by the @entity81 as it is raising awareness of a very common illness			0
there are more gastrointestinal infections caused by campylobacter than any other bacteria			2
‘ out of a number of possible risk factors , the greatest by far is eating or handling poultry meat which is why we are urging people during @entity132 to pay attention to how they store and handle chicken and other poultry meat at home			0
' @entity162 and kitchen hygiene are key here and if you have handled raw meat or used a chopping board , you need to wash these thoroughly using soap and hot water			0
’ an @entity81 spokesman said : ‘ @entity171 is a serious issue			0
not only can it cause severe illness and death , but it costs the economy hundreds of millions of pounds a year as a result of sickness absence and the burden on the @entity179			0

official warning issued linking chicken livers to campylobacter bacteria
this is the most common form of food poisoning in the @entity23 , say experts
trend of not fully cooking livers means *harmful* bugs are not killed
bug causes sickness and fever , but lead to paralysis and even death
