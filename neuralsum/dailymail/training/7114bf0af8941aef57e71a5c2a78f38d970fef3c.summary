in 1995 , the @entity0 's ' @entity2 ' image of the @entity3 became one of the most iconic images of the 20th century			1
now , two of @entity8 's orbiting observatories have captured a new - and very different - view of the nebula			0
the pillars are invisible in the @entity8 's image , which uses far - infrared light and x-rays to create a composite image that ' sees through ' the clouds of dust that form the pillars in @entity0 's famous image			1
the shot shows how young , hot stars ' sculpt ' the ultra-cool matter around them , forming new stars			0
the @entity8 @entity25 's new image shows the pillars and the wide field of gas and dust around them			0
captured in far - infrared wavelengths , the image allows astronomers to see inside the pillars and structures in the region it has become one of the most famous images of modern times			1
this image , taken with the @entity0 in 1995 , shows pillars of molecular hydrogen gas and dust			2
the giant pillars are light years in length and are so dense that interior gas contracts gravitationally to form stars @entity0 's visible - light image of the nebula ( top right ) is one of the most iconic astrophotographs ever captured by the space telescope			1
but other views also offer an insight the @entity3 is 6500 light - years away in the constellation @entity56			0
it contains a young hot star cluster , @entity60 , visible with modest back - garden telescopes , that is sculpting and illuminating the surrounding gas and dust , resulting in a huge hollowed - out cavity and pillars , each several light - years long			2
the @entity0 image hinted at new stars being born within the pillars			0
owing to obscuring dust , @entity0 's visible light picture was unable to see inside and prove that young stars were forming			1
combining both ends of the electromagnetic spectrum - the full spectrum of radiation that takes in everything from visible light to x-rays - the @entity8 's composite of the @entity25 and @entity80 space telescope images shows hot , young stars ' sculpting ' matter around them			1
the stars detected by the x-ray observations are interacting with the surrounding ultra-cool gas and dust , at only a few degrees above absolute zero , in the process of forming new stars			0
the near - infrared results showed that 11 of the ' gas globules ' detected by @entity0 possibly contained stars , and that the tips of the pillars contain stars and nebulosity not seen in the @entity0 image both wavelengths would be blocked by @entity99 â€™s atmosphere and could only be detected by space telescopes such as @entity25 and @entity80			1
in visible wavelengths , the nebula shines mainly due to reflected starlight and hot gas filling the giant cavity , covering the surfaces of the pillars and other dusty structures			0
at near - infrared wavelengths , the dust becomes almost transparent and the pillars practically @entity112 tendrils of dust and gas are seen to shine , giving astronomers clues about how it interacts with strong ultraviolet light from the hot stars seen by @entity80			0
@entity122 's image makes it possible to search for young stars over a much wider region and thus come to a much fuller understanding of the creative and destructive forces inside the @entity3 .			2
