@entity0 has confessed to a late - night darts habit and has even organised his home viewing arrangements so he can have an eye on the arrows as he studies football matches beamed into his home from around @entity8			1
' i was watching the @entity10 , on thursday night , all the games , ' said @entity12 boss @entity0			1
' i had two screens set up			2
one with the @entity10 on , and the other with @entity15			1
' we do n't have darts in @entity19 but ever since i arrived in @entity20 i 've been a fan			0
i do n't play and i 've not been to see it live			0
i prefer to watch at home			1
' @entity12 manager @entity0 has revealed he is a big fan of watching the darts at his home while the @entity12 boss is not happy to have been knocked out of the @entity10 he does get to watch darts some of his @entity12 players share his love for the game			1
@entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , were spotted at @entity34 in january watching the semi-finals of the @entity36			0
@entity12 's exit from the @entity10 , beaten in the second round by @entity39 , has brought the consolation of allowing their @entity19 manager to tune in for the @entity15 fixtures on thursday nights			1
@entity0 has been watching the likes of @entity45 ' @entity46 on television recently at his home @entity33 has been pictured at the darts , and his girlfriend @entity49 is a walk - on girl ' i was not happy to go out , my preference would have been to be playing against @entity52 , ' said @entity0 , but it has been another difficult season for @entity54 clubs in @entity56 competition			1
only @entity57 remain in the @entity10 , while @entity58 and @entity59 must overturn first - leg deficits next week in @entity61 and @entity62 respectively , if they are to reach the last eight of the @entity64			2
@entity65 were knocked out of the @entity64 , and @entity58 and @entity59 face uphill tasks @entity57 are the only @entity54 team remaining in the @entity10 after @entity12 and @entity68 's exits ' @entity56 teams have an advantage on @entity54 teams , ' said @entity0			1
' the most difficult period of the season in @entity54 is @entity74 when they have a break			0
in february and march it is very tough for the @entity54 teams			0
' the number of games we play is more than the @entity56 teams			0
teams in the other leagues are fresher then the @entity54 teams			0
' our competition is the toughest in the world			0
maybe this explains the results in @entity8			0
teams like @entity90 are only focused on the @entity64			0
@entity65 are focused on the @entity91 and the @entity15			2
@entity0 says the struggles of @entity54 teams like @entity12 is down to the strength of the @entity15 @entity95 celebrates his second goal against @entity97 in @entity12 ' win at @entity99 last week ' it 's not an excuse but the reality			1
it 's very difficult to arrive fresh in the same way another team from @entity8 arrives fresh in the @entity64 or the @entity10			2
' spurs , sixth in the @entity15 with 10 to play , have won twice since they lost to @entity39 and were beaten in the @entity91 final by @entity65			2
like any darts fan , @entity0 knows the way his team finish will be all - important			1
they are at fourth - placed @entity112 on sunday and victory will boost their bid to qualify for next season 's @entity64 .			0

@entity0 has set up his home to watch football and darts
the @entity12 manager has never watched the sport live , though
@entity0 watches @entity15 *alongside* the @entity10
but he would prefer to still be in the competition playing @entity52
@entity12 boss says the @entity15 *disadvantages* its own teams
