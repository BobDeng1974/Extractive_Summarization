by @entity0 the number of district nurses has dropped by 50 per cent in the last ten years and they will be ‘ extinct ’ by 2025 , it has been claimed			1
the @entity4 has highlighted @entity6 figures showing there are now 6,656 in post compared to 12,620 in 2003			2
the union also warns that three - quarters of the remaining district nurses are so overworked they do not have time to properly talk to patients			1
endangered : district nurses may be extinct by 2025 unless around 10,00 posts can be filled , experts claim a survey it carried out of 2,438 such nurses found that 75 per cent had to leave patients ’ homes before finishing certain tasks - including asking patients if they had any concerns			1
district nurses mainly care for the elderly in their own homes or care homes and administer medication such as pain relief and eye drops and dress wounds			1
but they tend to be older than hospital nurses and when they retire , their posts are not being filled			0
unless urgent action is taken , the ' critically endangered ' nurses will be extinct in just over a decade , it was claimed yesterday			2
the government has repeatedly pledged to improve community services such as district nurses to enable the elderly to be cared for in their own homes rather than in hospital			1
but the @entity4 said in order for this to happen , an extra 10,000 district nurses needed to be recruited across the @entity6			1
concern : the lack of community nurses could put many elderly and frail patients at risk the research , which saw 2,400 district and community nurses polled , found that most community staff are ' pushed to breaking point ' , the spokeswoman said			0
a quarter said they had seen more than 12 patients on their last shift , meaning the time actually spent with the patient was stretched , she added			0
many of those questioned raised concerns about the time spent with patients , with the nurses on average spending just 37 per cent of their time delivering care			0
and eight out of 10 said they had worked additional hours on their last shift			0
the @entity4 , which is holding its annual congress in @entity74 this week , has also called on health officials to make training nurses have a mandatory placement in the community			1
@entity79 , chief executive and general secretary of the @entity4 , said : " people are living longer , but not necessarily healthier , lives			2
this trend will grow over the coming decades and presents a very specific nursing challenge			0
' the district nurse role is the foundation of a system which should be able to manage conditions and keep sick and frail people at home			2
remove those foundations and the whole edifice could come crashing down			0
' by 2025 , there will be many thousands of families with frail older relatives , who may well have survived a number of illnesses - and when they look for help to manage at home , it simply wo n't be there			0
' a @entity103 spokeswoman said : ' the chief nursing officer has set up a working group which is looking specifically at what we can do to increase the number of community nurses and we are committed to training 10,000 more frontline community staff by 2020			1
