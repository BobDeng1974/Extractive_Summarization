a dream beach house in @entity2 has turned into a nightmare for a @entity4 couple after the $ 680,000 , five - bedroom home was built on the wrong lot			1
six months after the custom house was built along the @entity7 near @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 learned it 's on the wrong lot in the gated @entity13 community			1
@entity14 tells the @entity15 they 're in ' total disbelief			2
but , with this headache and grief , we 're not so sure			2
the @entity31 is looking pretty good right now , ' he said			2
the couple own 18 other residential lots in the community , but the mistake managed to be made on a lot owned by someone else			2
they bought the lot in 2012 for $ 160,000 and hired @entity40 to build a three - story , 5,000 - square - foot vacation rental			1
the other lot was purchased for $ 355,000 by a @entity45 couple way back in 2003			0
@entity46 and @entity10 say the error can be traced to a 2013 survey			1
the mistake was uncovered in september after the house had been rented frequently			1
tough mistake to make : while the @entity10 family own over a dozen lots in the @entity13 community , the builders managed to build on one owned by another couple -- one that cost a great deal more in june 2012 the @entity59 purchased the lot of 23 @entity61 for $ 160,000			1
they then commissioned @entity40 to build the 5,000 square - foot home to be used as a vacation rental but the contractors mistakenly began construction next door at 21 @entity68			1
@entity69 and his wife @entity70 , who live in @entity71 , @entity45 purchased that lot in 2003 for $ 355,000 , but never built their own property there			0
@entity46 claim the mistake is down to a land survey conducted last year when a simple mistake led to the wrong lot being assessed			2
@entity80 , who is @entity81 's chief building official , told @entity82 in @entity2 that the mistake , though regretable , is understandable			1
he says the west side of @entity85 has a long stretch of around 10 vacant lots all with short grass , with no clear landmarks or markers for builders or surveyors			0
@entity46 vice president @entity92 says the company is trying to negotiate a settlement			0
the couple hired a lawyer			0
' we are in the process of trying to schedule a conference call and find a fair resolution without the lawyers , ' @entity92 said			0
' i have built about 600 homes in @entity81 and this has never happened to me before			0
it does happen , but it 's rare			0
' we are 100 percent committed to finding a resolution that is fair , ' he said			0
what that resolution will be remains to be seen			0
@entity111 thinks the best solution would be for the owners to switch lot , but @entity10 sounds as if he could be open to other fixes			1
' we have some ideas and plans , but i 'm not going to discuss them here , ' @entity10 said			1
' we 're working all channels to deal with this			0

@entity9 and @entity10 learned their 3 - story vacation home in @entity13 , @entity2 was misplaced six months after it was *completed*
@entity10 and the builder agree say the error can be traced to a *flawed* 2013
the mistake was uncovered in september after the house had been rented out for months
