as the weather gets warmer many of us will dust off our large and cumbersome bladed fans			0
but @entity4 has developed a lighter , smaller and more powerful alternative that can blow out seven times more air than it sucks in			0
the @entity9 - ki q uses fluid dynamics to take air in at the rear of the 10 - inch ( 25cm ) device , move it through specially designed channels before blasting it from the front via a turbofan			1
@entity18 , which designed the device , said that once the turbofan has moved the air flow to the front of the device , a ' high - pressure jet airflow ' creates straight , direct blasts of air			1
alternatively , the q has a ' 1/f fluctuation ' function that reduces the force of the air flow , and sends ' natural wind ' that mimics outside breeze these channels have been designed to reduce how much drag the air flow is subjected to as it moves through the ' ball '			2
and the holes have been designed in such a way so that the flow collects additional air at is leaves the device to boost its trajectory and output			1
in particular , there is a central outlet			0
@entity43 is drawn into the ' q ' using small inlets on the rear and are driven by the so - called impellers , or bladed fins			1
this airflow pulls in additional air using the large round air inlets plotted around the @entity25 , and all of this is released through the main outlet			2
the @entity53 ( pictured ) uses fluid dynamics to take air in small inlets on the rear before it is moved using so - called impellers through specially designed channels			1
this airflow pulls in additional air from air inlets plotted around the @entity25 , and all of this is released through the main outlet the fan is on sale in @entity65 for ¥ 39,350 ( £ 220 ) and is available in @entity66 , @entity67 ( pictured ) and @entity68			1
it is powered by a @entity71 motor and comes with an @entity72 for between one and three hours @entity18 , which designed the device , said that once the turbofan has moved the air flow to the front of the device , a ' high - pressure jet airflow ' creates straight , direct blasts of air			1
alternatively , the @entity25 has a ' 1/f fluctuation ' function that reduces the force of the air flow , instead sending ' natural , fluctuating wind ' that mimics the outside breeze			2
' everything is up to you , ' as the firm explained			0
' it can be used as circulator			0
we will deliver the combined wind in your life			0
' the @entity25 fan has a diameter of 10 inches ( 25cm ) , is 11 inches tall ( 27cm ) and weighs 4.6lbs ( 2.1kg ) the @entity25 fan is on sale in @entity65 for ¥ 39,350 ( £ 220 ) and is available in @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
@entity99 has contacted @entity4 to see if the device will be available in other regions			0
it is powered by a @entity71 motor plugged into the mains and comes with an @entity72 for between one and three hours			0
it has a diameter of 10 inches ( 25cm ) , is 11 inches tall ( 27cm ) and weighs 4.6lbs ( 2.1kg ) .			2

@entity53 uses fluid dynamics to boost how much air is released
@entity43 is brought through the rear of the 10 - inch ( 25cm ) device
a ' high - pressure jet airflow ' then turns this air into blast of directed ' wind '
the ' q ' fan is on sale in @entity65 for ¥ 39,350 ( £ 220 )
