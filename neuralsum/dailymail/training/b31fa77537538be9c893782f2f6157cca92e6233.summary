by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 29 july 2012 updated : 03:29 est , 30 july 2012 it is a tradition which began more than 200 years ago , when @entity2 was on the throne and @entity4 was at war with @entity6			0
but living on @entity7 is no longer possible for the families of the brave lifeboatmen who have helped stricken sailors in and around the @entity12			1
life on this remote peninsula in @entity15 , buffeted by winds and tides , has become so isolated that the families of @entity4 's only full - time lifeboat crew will leave their homes and move inland later this year			1
end of an era : @entity12 lifeboat coxswain @entity22 and his wife @entity23 are preparting to leave their home on @entity7 , where families of lifeboatmen have lived for more than 200 years out on a limb : @entity7 , which has been home to lifeboatmen and their families since the early 19th century , is a 20,000ft spit of land at the mouth of the @entity12 remote : families living on the peninsula have become increasingly isolated as it has been buffeted by winds and tides and affected by erosion the lifeboat crew will then begin a new shift system with five members working six days on and six days off			1
families have lived in houses on the remote 20,000ft spit of land since the early 19th century			1
the lifeboat station was founded in 1810			0
it now keeps one of the busiest of the @entity52 's all - weather vessels , dealing with more than 50 incidents a year			0
moving on : @entity54 , pictured with husband @entity22 , said the lifeboatmen 's wives had taken the decision to leave ' really hard ' but increased erosion has caused the road leading to the peninsula 's tip to become impassable at times as the wind blows sand across			1
high tides frequently make it impossible for children to get to school and two families had to stay in a hotel last year when a sea surge cut off the road			1
the lifeboat crew must be available for call - out 24 hours a day , which makes life difficult for spouses who must plan ahead for even the simplest of tasks			2
the nearest shop is a 16 - mile round trip from their homes			0
@entity12 lifeboat coxswain @entity80 , 54 , said : ' i am going to be gutted when i leave			1
i think they have made the absolutely right decision to move the families but i have been here 21 years and love it			2
' his wife @entity23 said : ' the wives have taken it really hard			0
if you could bottle what @entity7 is and sell it you ’d be a millionaire			2
' it ’s very laid back			0
we do n’t lock doors			0
we are going to find it so strange going out into the big wide world			0
' six families are on the move , and the last is due to leave @entity7 on august 20			1
their homes will be converted into dormitories and offices			0
@entity102 , the @entity52 's divisional inspector , said the station was so remote that it was difficult to staff with volunteers			0
the lifeboat will remain with a fully professional crew and the @entity52 has recruited four new members to work the shift system			0
an @entity52 spokesman said : ' our crew make many sacrifices to enable them to save lives at sea - a role they would be unable to carry out without the full support of their families - and the @entity52 has a duty of care to both its crew members and to the families			2
' gutted ' : @entity80 said he would find it hard to leave his home on the peninsula history : a lifeboat station has stood on @entity7 since 1810			2
the site is currently home to one of the @entity52 's busiest all - weather lifeboats changes : the lifeboat crew will begin a new shift system with members working six days on and six days off the way they were : the 1900 lifeboat crew , pictured with their vessel at @entity7 past residents : former members of the lifeboat crew at @entity7 tradition : lifeboat crews have been operating from @entity7 since 1810 ' we want to ensure our crew members have a satisfactory work - life balance , with appropriate time off from operational duty and their place of work			1
' the current way of working means this is impossible to achieve			0
' it has also become increasingly clear that the continuous erosion of @entity7 and regular breaching of the road will make it difficult to sustain community life for much longer			1
' travel for the crew members ' families to and from work , school , the shops et cetera can be difficult and sometimes dangerous			2
' as the @entity52 can no longer guarantee the safety and comfort of the families living on the @entity7 , it has become imperative that we progress plans to move them away from the lifeboat station			1
' place by the sea : families have lived in a cluster of homes on the peninsula for more than two centuries , but the current residents have been beset with difficulties caused by winds and tides nostalgic : the decision to move the families inland brings to an end more than 200 years of tradition			1

@entity190 and their families have lived on @entity7 , at the mouth of the @entity12 , since the early 19th century
but erosion caused by winds and tides has *damaged* roads and left the current crew increasingly isolated
