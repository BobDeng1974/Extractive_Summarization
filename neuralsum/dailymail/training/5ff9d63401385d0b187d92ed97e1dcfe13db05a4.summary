@entity0 has warned the @entity1 it risks damaging the reputation of tennis after players were forced to play in searing heat in @entity7			1
@entity9 player @entity8 and a ball boy both collapsed on court while @entity14 's @entity13 vomited then suffered cramp during her defeat as temperatures soared above @entity18			1

' inhumane ' : @entity14 's @entity13 ( above ) vomited then suffered cramp as temperatures soared above @entity18 during her defeat in the @entity1 in bad shape : @entity28 of @entity29 receives treatment by trainers during her first round match scorcher : @entity34 does her best to cool down during a break in her match at the @entity1 temperatures topped out at @entity38 at 5.45pm , just after @entity0 began his first - round match against @entity41 's @entity40 , which he went on to win 6 - 1 6 - 1 6 - 3			1
but the pair were fortunate that @entity43 is one of the stadium courts , so they were at least able to play in shade			0
the tournament implemented part of its extreme heat policy , with women being given a 10 - minute break between the second and third sets , but they decided not to put it fully into operation , which would have seen play suspended and roofs on show courts closed			2
@entity8 described the conditions as ' inhumane ' , adding : ' having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it 's too hot to play , until somebody dies			1
' stricken : @entity8 lies on the court after collapsing during his first - round match with @entity64 toiling : @entity8 was just one of several players who struggled as temperatures reached @entity67 easy does it : @entity70 helps a ball boy who collapsed during his match against @entity73 @entity74 : the ball boy is helped by an official as the soaring temperatures caused havoc in @entity7 @entity0 said : ' it 's definitely something that you maybe have to look at a little bit			1
as much as it 's easy to say the conditions are safe - a few people said there 's doctors saying it 's fine - it only takes one bad thing to happen			1
' and it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing , ball kids are collapsing , people in the stands are collapsing			1
that 's obviously not great			2
' i know when i went out to hit before the match , the conditions at 2.30pm or 3pm were very , very tough			2
anyone 's going to struggle in that heat			2
' there 's been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks			2
i do n't know exactly why that is			0
in this heat , that 's when you 're really pushing it to your limits			2
you do n't want to see anything bad happen to anyone			0
' @entity115 of @entity41 cools down with an ice pack during his first round match against @entity118 ' it looks terrible for the whole sport ' : @entity0 has criticised organisers for forcing players to continue in the searing heat in @entity7 ' it only takes one bad thing to happen ' : temperatures topped out at @entity38 at 5.45pm , just after @entity0 began his first - round match against @entity41 's @entity40 , which he went on to win 6 - 1 6 - 1 6 - 3 @entity129 bonus : the soaring temperatures seem to be doing wonders for @entity0 's girlfriend @entity132 ( above ) who showed off her tanned legs as she cheered him from the sidelines when to stop matches is at the discretion of referee @entity138 after a rule change this year , and based on readings not just of temperature but also humidity and wind			1
@entity0 said : ' apparently it was n't that humid today			1
that 's why it was n't implemented			0
there 's different rules for the men and women , i do n't know why			0
' i did n't sit down and discuss whether the guys are happy with the rules or not			0
but every singles person that i saw coming in from practice or going out to play a match or coming back from a match , everyone just said , " it 's really hot today "			0
' cooling off : a tennis fan in @entity7 gets a blast of cold air in as the temperature continues to rise water result : another fan finds solace in a fountain on the second day of play at the year 's first grand slam in a statement , chief medical officer @entity169 said : ' the majority of matches were completed without any court calls from the medical team			1
' of course there were a few players who experienced heat - related illness or discomfort , but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match			0
' generally the playing group coped extremely well			0
' refreshing : a young fan goes in head first in a bid to cool down during the heatwave in @entity7 patriotic : an @entity189 fan shows her colours while cooling off in the @entity7 heat but the severe heat appeared to be anything but a nuisance for his 25 - year - old girlfriend @entity132 , who showed off her tanned legs as she cheered him on			0
none coped better than @entity0 , who was playing only his third competitive match following back surgery but was detained for only an hour and 27 minutes by @entity40			1
the world number 112 was clearly not in the @entity205 champion 's class , but there was no doubt the fourth seed was striking the ball extremely well			1
showering : @entity210 , who won his first - round match on monday , takes time out in the fountain			0
