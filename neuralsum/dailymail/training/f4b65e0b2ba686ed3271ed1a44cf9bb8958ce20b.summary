by @entity0 published : 20:31 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 20:29 est , 13 january 2014 married couples are happier than those who live together , a major @entity3 - funded study said yesterday			1
it found that even though husbands and wives have greater doubts than unmarried couples about the quality of their relationships , they are more content than cohabitees			1
when asked if they are happy with their lives overall , married couples rate themselves much happier than other couples do			1
content : married couples are happier than those who live together , a major @entity3 - funded study said yesterday the @entity19 ? study , produced by the @entity20 , said mothers were the happiest people of all			1
and in general , couples without children were happier than those who were parents			2
however , married people were happier than unmarried couples , whether or not they had children			1
the study , based on surveys of almost 5,000 couples , found marriage was associated with happiness despite the willingness of married couples to admit to flaws in their relationship			1
a cup of tea or an offer of help around the house can make all the difference in a relationship , according to the research			0
it said that an everyday comforting gesture such as giving a stressed partner a cuppa can have a big impact			0
researcher dr @entity48 said : ‘ many consider a loving gesture to be as valuable as hearing “ i love you ”			0
@entity53 romantic gestures do n’t nurture a relationship as much as taking your partner a cup of tea in bed			0
’ married couples were more willing than others to admit worrying more about the chores or money than whether they shared the same values			1
they were less likely to say they liked to make time for each other , and more likely to say they were drifting apart than that they were entranced with each other ’s sense of humour			0
but nevertheless they said they were happier			0
the report said : ‘ both married and unmarried people without children are happier with their partner than parents			2
’ however , it found : ‘ married parents are as happy with life overall as couples without children and both groups score higher on this measure than their unmarried counterparts			2
’ the findings echoed results revealed by the government ’s own attempt to measure national happiness and well - being , in which surveys conducted by the @entity88 found that married people are more satisfied with their lives than others			2
they come at a time of continued controversy over the lack of state support for marriage			0
happy : the @entity19 ? study by the @entity20 found mothers were the happiest people of all @entity101 ’s plan for a limited tax break for less well - off married couples , worth £ 3.85 a week , has come under strong criticism from his @entity107 partners who say the @entity3 has no business subsidising one kind of relationship			1
mothers are happier than anybody else , even if they have little regard for their husbands or partners , the research found			1
despite evidence that in many cases their relationship with their partner was on the slide , mothers rated their happiness higher – at 4.1 on a scale of five – than that of fathers or childless men and women			0
the report said : ‘ we can infer that children could be the primary source of happiness for mothers rather than their partner			0
’ married people are , according to overwhelming evidence gathered over many years , generally better off than the unmarried			2
they enjoy better health and their children do better at school			0
but the new wave of academic well - being surveys that try to ‘ drill down into embodied lived experience ’ , as the @entity20 report puts it , are now signalling that marriage is likely to bring greater happiness with it			2
the @entity20 report , which was funded by the government ’s @entity148 , said both married parents and childless married couples put their overall happiness at around 4.1 out of five			1
unmarried couples , whether parents or childless , scored just over 3.9 .			0

married couples are happier than those who live together , study reveals
but they also have greater doubts about the quality of their relationships
@entity20 research found mothers are the happiest people of all
