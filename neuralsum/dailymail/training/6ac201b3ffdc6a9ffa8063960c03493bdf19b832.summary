in a speech concerning immigration last tuesday , president @entity0 made it all about him			1
while @entity0 was at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , the first - person singular was employed 91 times in the speech , @entity5 reported on friday			1
that figure did not include @entity0 quoting both a letter he received and a business owner 's remarks , the website noted			1
@entity17 found that @entity0 - when neither quoting nor using the contractions ' i 'm , ' ' i 've , and ' i 'd ' - said the words ' i , ' ' me , ' and ' my ' 73 times			1
the contractions ' i 'm , ' ' i 've , ' and ' i 'd , ' meanwhile , were employed 18 times when the @entity0 was n't quoting in his speech			1
' here , can i just say this ? , ' he said , per the @entity41 transcript of his remarks			1
' all right , i 've listened to you			1
all right ? now , i 've been respectful			1
so let me -- ( applause			1
) all right ? nobody is removing you			1
but you ’ve got to listen to me , too			1
all right ? ( @entity49			1
) and i understand you may disagree			2
i understand you may disagree			2
but we 've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues			1
all right ? ' however , @entity5 previously reported the first - person singular was employed by @entity0 199 times in july			1
with last week 's action by @entity0 that expanded the deferred action program and added millions of other immigrants , a harsh reality about the president 's changes has come to light : @entity0 may be allowing them to remain in the @entity64 , but it does n't mean their state will let them drive a car , get an education at an affordable rate or obtain health insurance			1
a patchwork of rules began to form in states - largely along political lines - after the president allowed some young immigrants to stay in the country			2
conservative states like @entity81 and @entity82 kept them from getting driver 's licenses while liberal locations were much more welcoming in terms of state services and benefits			2
now , states must make new decisions on how to respond to the president 's action that allows millions more immigrants to remain in the @entity64 in @entity97 , democrats , immigration groups and health care advocates are pushing for the immigrants to receive health care under the state 's version of the @entity103 program			2
the @entity97 @entity104 is deciding how to proceed			2
the president 's action excludes immigrants who came to the country illegally from qualifying for federal health benefits			2
in @entity110 , officials are drawing up a bill for the @entity112 making clear that unauthorized immigrants can become teachers in the state			2
current rules specify that a prospective teacher must be a @entity64 citizen or lawful permanent resident before they can receive a teaching license in @entity110			2
a new gubernatorial administration in @entity82 will have to decide whether to continue a hard - line approach toward state benefits that outgoing gov. @entity123 took			0
after @entity0 took action in 2012 granting legal status to 1.8million young people brought to the @entity64 as children , @entity123 issued an executive order denying them driver 's licenses or other state benefits , including in - state tuition at the state 's public universities			1
a federal appeals court ruled the license ban was unconstitutional , and @entity123 is considering an appeal to the @entity64 @entity139			0
' our position is unilateral action by the president does nothing to change the fact that an illegal alien 's presence is the @entity64 is not authorized under federal law , ' @entity123 spokesman @entity140 told the @entity150 @entity0 tried to quiet one of the three hecklers on tuesday , saying ' i 've heard you			1
but you ’ve got to listen to me , too			0
all right ? ' @entity82 's @entity157 governor - elect , @entity156 , has said he intends to continue @entity123 's current ban , if it survives court challenges			0
@entity162 's @entity161 governor , @entity160 , has taken a decidedly different tack			0
he 's a supporter of state laws granting in - state tuition to people without legal status and grants them driver 's licenses			0
he has even been willing to get into a policy fight with @entity0 on the stream of unaccompanied immigrant children from @entity174 over the @entity176 border , criticizing the @entity41 proposal earlier this year that could have expedited the deportation of the children			1
@entity82 remains an outlier in its treatment of immigrants granted work permits and is among the most harsh when it comes to those who remain in the @entity64 without legal authorization			0
states surrounding @entity82 provide in - state tuition to all residents , regardless of immigration status			0
and in january , @entity97 joins nine other states in allowing immigrants who ca n't prove they 're in the @entity64 legally to get a driver 's license			0
@entity196 provides leniency when it comes to driving privileges and education , despite passing a law in 2011 that mirrored @entity82 's landmark immigration crackdown , @entity204			0
the state issues driving - privilege cards that must be renewed annually for those who can not prove they 're in the country legally			0
nearly 36,300 were issued last year , said @entity210 , the director of @entity196 's @entity211			0
@entity196 also offers in - state tuition at public universities and colleges to residents not in the @entity64 legally			0
to be eligible , students must have attended a @entity196 high school for at least three years and earned a diploma or ged			0
they ca n't hold a non-immigrant visa and must file an application to legalize their immigration status when eligible to do so			0
in the 2012 - 2013 academic students , 929 students took advantage of the program			0
despite the fact that life would be easier if he left the state , @entity82 resident @entity227 said he 's staying put			0
' this is where we got dirty as kids , this is where we learn how to speak @entity240 , this is where we learn how to do a lot of stuff , ' he told the @entity150 ' here in @entity82 is where my friends , my family , live and i do n't see it as an option to run away , but rather stand up and change the conditions that we live under			0

@entity0 delivered the speech at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8
he used the pronouns ' i , ' ' me , ' and ' my ' 73 times in his delivered remarks
the contractions ' i 'm , ' ' i 've , ' and ' i 'd ' were employed 18 times
