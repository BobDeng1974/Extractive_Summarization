but the job of hunting the underground rodents that irritated the monarch as they destroyed his luxurious palace gardens still exists today			0
@entity10 is the latest in a long line of molecatchers employed to keep the royal palace and gardens rodent - free			1
serious work : @entity16 @entity10 , 36 , pictured in front of the @entity4 where he is the latest in a long line of molecatchers taking no prisoners : @entity10 displays a number of previously - caught frozen moles			1
he once spent three months chasing one mole elegant : the huge 800 hectares ( 2,000 acres ) grounds of the @entity4 have long been plagued by moles creating molehill son the manicured grass the 36 - year - old uses archaic metal traps that kill moles when their two prongs contract and snap the animals ' necks			1
but while the role might sound like something of a gimmick , mr @entity10 insists that his position is ' serious work '			1
the enthusiast signs his text messages off with the line ' @entity16 to the @entity2 ' and says his job is to ensure ' molehills do n't deface @entity46 's finest gardens '			2
the former gardener added : ' we still have visiting dignitaries too			0
imagine if they were to see them			0
' mr @entity10 is responsible for keeping the around 800 hectares ( 2,000 acres ) of magnificent horticulture mole - free on the grounds , which include @entity55 's cherished farm and famed gardener @entity57 's @entity56 and @entity58			1
while @entity10 approaches his constant hunt for the burrowing rodents with vigour , he also adds a touch of humour when talking about his role			1
archaic : @entity10 uses an age - old technique to catch the moles - a metal trap that smashes together when the mole passes , trapping the animal terminator : @entity10 displays a mole caught in a trap			1
the rodents cause molehills when they burrow , angering groundskeepers at the palace he said : ' i 'm known as the king 's molecatcher because @entity4 is still the palace			1
the king might be gone , but the palace still has moles , loads of them			0
which is good , as it keeps me in work			0
' @entity10 recalls one of his proudest moments as the capture of a ole he had been chasing for months			1
he said : ' moles are exceptionally clever			0
that 's why the majority of gardeners ca n't catch them			2
one of the wiliest i have ever encountered outsmarted my traps for three months ... eventually , it got lazy and i got it			0
' @entity10 also highlights how versatile the mole is			1
on a scorching summer day , he once stood aghast at a strange sight in one of the royal fountains : a mole swimming around the basin			0
' in my job , ' says @entity10 , ' i never fail to be surprised			2
' molecatcher to the king : @entity10 is the latest in a 330 - year line of molecatchers employed on the palace grounds @entity2 : a recently caught dead mole hangs from a bucket			1
@entity2 first hired a molecatcher in the late 1600s the royal molecatcher was first hired by @entity2 , the @entity117 king who moved the court to @entity4 , in the late 1600s			1
historians say that the monarch lavished so much money on the upkeep of his beloved residence that it plunged the entire country into debt			0
large mounds of earth mark out the routes travelled by the moles - solitary underground rodents with giant paws for digging			2
as the palace lies around 7.5 miles outside @entity134 ' city walls in the countryside , moles have long been able to burrow through the gardens , much to many groundskeepers ' annoyance			2
@entity10 describes his trapping technique as resembling a guillotine and says that he first tried poison but decided the trap , invented in the 1600s , was the best technique and most faithful to the historic role			1
zoologists say that a decline in natural predators like wild cats and weasels has resulted in a boom in mole populations			0
one single mole can make 30 molehills a day , which could see the entire gardens pockmarked within weeks if a large number of the rodents are burrowing within its walls			0
speaking about @entity162 's insistence on ridding the grounds of moles , head gardener @entity160 said : ' @entity4 was the greatest symbol of @entity3			1
after everything ( @entity167 ) spent on the gardens , imagine if the moles had been allowed to run riot ? all this money would have been squandered , wasted			0
' the molecatcher was rewarded with their own residence at @entity4			1
from the 1600s , the molecatchers all came from the same family - the @entity177 - until in 1812 @entity178 put a stop to the succession			2
' the last @entity182 molecatcher was a bit of a party animal , and turned the residence into a cabaret and a brothel , ' said @entity160			2
' one day @entity178 was strolling in the gardens , and a prostitute came out and propositioned him			0
the molecatcher was immediately thrown out and that was the end of the residence			2
' the gardener also cheekily suggests that good mole - catching can save lives			0
in 1702 , @entity195 of @entity196 died from injuries he sustained after his horse tripped on a molehill			0
