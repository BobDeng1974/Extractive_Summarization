by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 10 october 2013 an art director 's obsessive desire to photograph as many burglar alarms as she can has proven to be a surprisingly popular internet hit			1
@entity5 has picked up thousands of followers to her blog , @entity8 , since she first hit upon the idea of capturing them for the sake of posterity while photographing shop fronts			1
the 40 - year - old said she became ' fascinated ' with the ' naive ' designs and how they can often vary wildly from area to area			1
quirky : the @entity21 alarm on @entity22 in @entity23 ( left ) alongside a @entity24 ( right ) in @entity25 dated : it is ironic that this alarm above the @entity29 street sign in @entity30 would be called ' modern ' @entity32 diversity : alarms in inner cities tend to have more foreboding names			2
@entity36 ( left ) sits over @entity38 street in @entity39 , while a @entity41 alarm on deters burglars in @entity43 , @entity44 arguing the objects are pieces of local art , she states on her blog : ' amateurish logos predominate , seemingly designed by a jobbing printer or the proprietor ’s child , possibly under the influence of drink			1
' rural liveries tend towards the whimsical , with jaunty creatures and decorative fonts			0
' well - heeled towns offer pompous serif concepts such as @entity60 , while inner - city walls blare bold tabloid exhortations to stand fast and @entity64 ! ' every day a snap of the latest weird and wacky design to have caught her attention is added to her site			2
some of the alarms are designed to look like flowers or animals whereas others look more intimidating and obvious			0
deterrent : it is unlikely this @entity79 alarm in @entity80 , @entity77 would keep the burglars away dogged : this @entity83 alarm in the wealthy @entity85 area of @entity86 appears almost welcoming once she has uploaded her pictures she categorises them into sections including technology , science , houses , union jacks , heraldic , royalty and crazy creatures			1
followers to her blog even upload their own photos to ms @entity5 's website			1
obsessed : @entity5 has taken photos of hundreds of burglar alarms the art director and editor from central @entity23 said : ' it all began when i was doing a project photographing shop fronts			1
' after looking at one of the pictures i realised there was a burglar alarm			0
' it was called a blitz and then i saw two more called @entity115 and @entity116 , and i wondered why they had @entity119 names			0
' i was interested so i started looking at alarms more and more and began photographing them and eventually launched a blog and began posting my pictures online			1
' after a recent trip to @entity125 i returned with 76 photos of burglar alarms			0
it ’s a local art , and it ’s fun noting how styles vary by area			2
she added : ' @entity133 ’s old design was one of my favourites and although they ’ve recently updated their identity i ’m delighted they ’ve kept the wise old owl			0
' i used to take all the pictures of the burglar alarm boxes myself , but the blog has got so popular that people have started submitting them			2
' it really has developed into something that i never could have imagined			0
' urban : the @entity147 alarm ( left ) in @entity148 , @entity77 has seen better days as has the @entity150 alarm ( right ) in @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 out of place : this @entity156 alarm adorns the exterior of @entity158 complimentary : this alarm at it 's all @entity161 @entity39 resembles the @entity162 in @entity163 big beast : the @entity166 burglar alarm in @entity167 , @entity39 does look like it means business			0
