by @entity0 smart phones are more sophisticated than ever , yet the batteries that power them have remained relatively archaic – until now			1
scientists at the @entity5 have managed to develop the most powerful microbatteries ever created , making them almost 1000 times stronger than existing lithium batteries and paving the way for smartphones that could be charged in just one second			1
‘ this is a whole new way to think about batteries , ’ said lead researcher @entity12			1
superpower : the next generation of microbatteries developed by the @entity5 ( pictured ) could revolutionise mobile phone use the new batteries owe their high performance to their internal three - dimensional microstructure			1
like all batteries , they have two key components the anode ( minus side ) and cathode ( plus side )			1
building on a novel fast - charging cathode design , scientists have developed a matching anode and then developed a new way to integrate the two components at the microscale to make a complete battery with superior performance			1
with so much power , the batteries could enable sensors or radio signals that broadcast 30 times farther , or devices 30 times smaller			1
the batteries are rechargeable and can charge 1,000 times faster than competing technologies			1
in theory a credit - card - thin phone could be charged in less than a second			1
' a battery can deliver far more power than anybody ever thought ' , he said			0
' in recent decades , electronics have gotten small			0
' the thinking parts of computers have gotten small			0
' and the battery has lagged far behind			1
' this is a microtechnology that could change all of that			0
' now the power source is as high - performance as the rest of it			2
’ until recently , users have had to choose between power and energy			0
for applications that need a lot of power , like broadcasting a radio signal over a long distance , capacitors can release energy very quickly but can only store a small amount			0
for applications that need a lot of energy , like playing a radio for a long time , fuel cells and batteries can hold a lot of energy but they take a long term to recharge			2
‘ there ’s [ always been ] a sacrifice , ’ said @entity84 , a graduate student and first author of the paper			0
‘ if you want high energy you ca n’t get high power ; if you want high power it ’s very difficult to get high energy			0
' but for very interesting applications , especially modern applications , you really need both			0
' that ’s what our batteries are starting to do			2
‘ we ’re really pushing into an area in the energy storage design space that is not currently available with technologies today			0
’ @entity104 routine : because of their poor battery power , modern mobiles regularly need recharging the new microbatteries offer both power and energy , and by tweaking the structure slightly , the researchers can fine tune them so there is a better compromise between power and energy scale			0
scientists sat they owe their high performance to their internal three - dimensional microstructure			1
like all batteries , they have two key components , the anode ( minus side ) and cathode ( plus side )			2
mobile phone batteries are a frequent cause for anger because of their relatively short battery life building on a new fast - charging cathode design by professor @entity132 ’s group , @entity12 and @entity84 have developed a matching anode and a new way to integrate the two components at the microscale to make a complete battery with superior performance			1
with so much power , the batteries could enable sensors or radio signals to broadcast 30 times farther , or devices 30 times smaller			1
the batteries are rechargeable and can charge 1,000 times faster than competing technologies			1
in theory , a credit - card - thin phone could be charged in less than a second			1
in addition to consumer electronics , medical devices , lasers , sensors and other applications could see leaps forward in technology with such power sources available			2
‘ any kind of electronic device is limited by the size of the battery – until now , ’ @entity12 said			0
' consider personal medical devices and implants , where the battery is an enormous brick , and it ’s connected to itty - bitty electronics and tiny wires			2
now the battery is also tiny			0
’ the researchers are now looking into integrating their batteries with other electronics components , as well as the manufacturability of them at a low cost			2
‘ we can now think outside of the box , ’ @entity84 said			0
‘ it ’s a new enabling technology			2
it ’s not a progressive improvement over previous technologies ; it breaks the normal paradigms of energy sources			0
' it ’s allowing us to do different , new things			0

batteries have lagged behind mobile phone technology - until now
scientists at the @entity5 have developed a super microbattery that is 1000 times more powerful than its lithium *predecessors*
they claim that mobile batteries of the future could charge within a second
