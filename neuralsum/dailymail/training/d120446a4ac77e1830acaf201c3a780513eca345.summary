a @entity2 scientist fathered up to 600 children after founding a fertility clinic that promised to provide sperm donors from ‘ intelligent stock ’ , it emerged yesterday			1
biologist @entity7 supplied sperm to the partners of infertile men from the middle and upper classes , including ‘ peers of the realm ’			1
his wife @entity15 later destroyed medical records , meaning most of those conceived there – and their thousands of subsequent offspring – have no idea of their true family history and blood ties			1
family ties : @entity26 with a photograph of his father @entity7 half - brothers : @entity26 from @entity30 , left , and @entity31 from @entity32 , right , were both conceived at the controversial @entity34 clinic and have discovered that @entity7 is their biological father but two men conceived by artificial insemination at the practice , which operated from the early 1940s until the mid- 1960s , have completed research suggesting up to two - thirds of sperm donations during that period were by @entity7			1
@entity31 , one of @entity7 ’s biological sons , estimated he would have made 20 donations a year , meaning he is likely to have fathered between 300 and 600 children			1
the barrister found out in 1965 , at the age of 12 , that he was born from a sperm donor , but was never told who his biological father was			1
he finally discovered the truth through dna tests and has subsequently made contact with 11 of his half - siblings , including documentary - maker @entity26 , who led research into the clinic			1
mr @entity31 said he had mixed feelings about his unusual family history			0
donor : it is believed that @entity7 may have fathered up to 600 children through donating sperm at the fertility clinic he founded with his wife @entity15 in the 1940s he said : ‘ it ’s rather uncomfortable , because artificial insemination was developed on an industrial scale for cattle and i do n’t like the feeling of having been “ bred ”			1
‘ but meeting the half siblings that i have tracked down has been a very life - enriching experience			2
this does make it frustrating too , because i know there are all those other siblings out there who i do n’t know but would really like to meet			0
i ’d love to be able to hire a huge marquee and invite them all to a party			0
’ @entity7 and @entity34 ’s clinic , based in @entity32 ’s @entity84 , is believed to have helped women conceive around 1,500 babies known as the ‘ @entity87 ’			1
@entity88 , 36 , hit the headlines last december after revealing he had fathered 14 children despite being a virgin by donating his sperm to reproductively challenged couples			2
mr @entity88 , from @entity94 , @entity95 , set up a free online sperm bank to help childless couples in situations where he claimed the only other alternative would be sex with a stranger			2
speaking on @entity103 's daytime show , he said : ' 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies			2
so i do n't have other activity outside of that			0
' i will probably be the 40 - year - old virgin , except i 'll have 15 plus kids			2
' he told @entity112 : ‘ i 'm helping people in need ... i 'm not running a business here			0
' the high fees meant most of their clients were middle - class , but @entity34 also claimed to have helped many of the upper classes and even some ‘ peers of the realm ’			2
the couple used family friends to provide sperm , but a shortage of donors is believed to have led to @entity7 providing the majority			1
dna tests were carried out in 2007 on 18 people conceived at the clinic between 1943 and 1962			1
the tests found that 12 of the group – two - thirds – were @entity7 ’s children			1
dr @entity34 told a 1959 government forum on artificial insemination : ‘ i matched race , colouring and stature and all donors were drawn from intelligent stock			2
’ she added : ‘ i would n’t take a donor unless he was , if anything , a little above average			0
‘ if you are going to do it [ create a child ] deliberately , you have got to put the standards rather higher than normal			0
’ an article the couple wrote in 1945 about their work prompted a peer to denounce their activities in the @entity158 as ‘ the work of @entity160 ’			0
@entity161 , then archbishop of @entity163 , also demanded the closure of the clinic			0
@entity166 - born @entity7 died in 1972 , aged 70			1
his wife died 11 years ago			0
mr @entity31 was involved in a campaign to stop sperm donors being anonymous , but said he still wanted further changes in the law			0
he said : ‘ i would like to see birth certificates also carrying the name of the sperm or egg donor			0
‘ most recipient parents do n’t tell their children they are conceived this way , meaning they would never know to search for a donor father			0
‘ people have a right to know about their own history			0

@entity7 set up the controversial @entity185 clinic with his wife @entity186 in the 1940s
only select *members* of the couple 's friends were chosen as donors to help women conceive 1,500 babies
two biological sons have found 18 others conceived at clinic - 12 were fathered by dr @entity7
