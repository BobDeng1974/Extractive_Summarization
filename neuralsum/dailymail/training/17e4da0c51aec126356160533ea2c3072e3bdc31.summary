@entity0 is a great professional for club and country but as a captain of a team who crashed out in the manner @entity7 did , he ’ll have a nightmare summer			1
i say this from experience			2
the @entity7 squad arrived back in the @entity13 in midweek to enjoy what ’s left of the break			1
i suspect it will be a long , hard holiday season for @entity0			1
he ’ll be on the beach or around a pool somewhere , still trying to shake off the end - on - season headache of what happened to @entity22			2
and now there ’s the disappointment of @entity25 to ponder too			2
top pro : @entity0 is one of the best professionals in the @entity29 game fun in the sun : @entity0 relaxes on holiday with his wife @entity33 one moment the holiday is bliss			1
the sun ’s shining , everyone ’s enjoying themselves , you ’re starting to unwind			2
then - bang ! - a nightmare recollection of a particular incident invades your brain and wo n’t go away			2
i 've been there , trying to get away from the misery of losing a @entity47 final , an @entity49 final , the @entity51 title , whatever tournament @entity7 had just been knocked out of , and on and on			1
losing is part and parcel of a footballers ’ life but the moment it stops hurting you probably need to pack it in			0
haunted : @entity7 's players will have flashbacks to their @entity65 nightmare while they are on holiday to celebrate the @entity65 , i ’ve added a special @entity67 to my fashion range , incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and with a share of the proceeds going to charity			1
you can find them via www.5mag.co and you can follow me on @entity76 for a chance to win exclusive prizes @ rioferdy5 but the hurting does mar your time ‘ away ’ from football			0
you ’re never really away			0
one moment you ’re sitting there thinking yes , i ’m with my family , surrounded by the people i love , in paradise on a beach somewhere , then it hits			0
the defining moments of the season where you lost whatever you lost			2
the poor decision you made in a particular game			0
i could have done better			0
then one the kids splashes you and says get in the pool and you snap out of it , for a while			0
the only way to make a positive from these negatives is use the depressing thoughts of failures past as fuel for future success			0
the new season wo n’t come soon enough for @entity0			1
he ’ll want to go again , put the bad stuff behind him			0
i ’m sure that he , like me , is still wondering why so many @entity7 players ca n’t replicate their club form in an @entity7 shirt			1
and why ca n’t we handle the pressure ? the answer to both questions lies partially in the brilliant foreign players across the @entity51			1
all of our best club teams in @entity7 have a significant number of brilliant foreigners			1
so the @entity29 players alongside them are assisted			2
it ’s no coincidence that you play better as the quality of the players around you increases ! but at club level it ’s also the foreign players , mainly if not exclusively , who play the truly ‘ under pressure ’ roles			1
by that i mean footballers comfortable on the ball who can keep it , comfortably , and use it , meaningfully			0
i ’m thinking of @entity141 and @entity142 at @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 at @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 at @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 at @entity152			0
ball player : @entity142 has shown how good he is at keeping the ball for @entity143 keep ball : @entity156 plays well under pressure @entity158 is a @entity143 great and he ’ll often pop up with a goal , of course			2
@entity156 and @entity161 can keep the ball and use it , and all three are @entity29 , albeit two of them developing youngsters			0
but with so many of the best foreign players , holding and relieving pressure on your team - mates comes as standard			1
it ’s the norm for them			0
they do week - in , week - out and they get used to it			0
by and large @entity7 do n’t have those type of players , certainly not enough of them with enough experience			1
and when the pressure it as its greatest , on a @entity65 stage , that 's a problem			1
@entity184 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity187			0

@entity0 and rest of @entity7 players will be haunted by @entity65 nightmare
players will want the new season to come *quickly* so they can play again
foreign players dominate under pressure roles in @entity51
