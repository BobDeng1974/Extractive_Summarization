by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 05:13 est , 10 may 2013 a pair of ' lawless ' schoolboy gang leaders who terrorised elderly people in their neighbourhood have been ordered by a court to ' grow up ' or face jail			1
@entity7 and @entity8 - who dubbed themselves ' the @entity10 ' - were the leaders of a gang of youths that ran rampage around @entity15 in @entity16 ; smashing windows , vandalising cars , and deliberately intimidating vulnerable people and pensioners			1
local residents described how the 16 - year - olds turned the area into ' @entity24 ' , leaving some elderly people too terrified to step outside their front doors			1
' @entity27 ' : @entity7 , left , and @entity8 , right , both 16 , ran rampage around @entity15 , @entity16 @entity7 and @entity8 were named and shamed at @entity29 today , as they were served with a two - year asbo and threatened with up to five years in jail unless they start to behave			1
the pair , who swore at passersby outside the court , had been convicted of attempted theft and criminal damage at earlier hearings			2
details of their campaign of intimidation emerged after victims agreed to keep diaries of their ordeals over an eight - month period			2
the court heard how the pair raided local buses taking hammers that were in place in case of emergencies , stole wheelie bins , and jumped on cars			1
@entity58 @entity57 a @entity58 told the duo - who police said ' had no respect for anyone or anything ' - the order was their ' last chance '			1
@entity8 said at today 's hearing : ' no more messing about			1
' @entity58 @entity57 replied : ' you need to really grow up while you have got the chance before the authorities take the view that you need to be put somewhere that can impose some sort of discipline			1
' it is not really the right words " messing about "			2
' taking hammers , breaking windows , damaging cars , you would realise the potential if that happened to you			1
' if you parked your car outside and it got smashed by someone , would you just think " he is only messing about " ? i think you would take a slightly different view , ' mr @entity57 said ,			1
' have you thought about the consequences , causing your mother and family heartache ? ' the @entity58 went on			2
' this is your last chance , maybe down the line in six to 12 months the order will be adjusted , if not you are going to suffer			1
make sure you go away and are a credit to your families			2
' ' @entity94 ' : elderly residents of @entity15 , @entity16 ( pictured ) , were afraid to leave their homes as the pair ran rampage around the neighbourhood after the case police and neighbours said both teenagers - who had been excluded from mainstream education - had brought ' hell on earth ' to the area			1
they had initially been offered ' acceptable behaviour ' contracts to avoid court action - but refused to sign			2
@entity110 @entity109 said : ' they think they are invincible and called themselves as much , and they believed it was acceptable to go on a rampage targeting vulnerable and elderly people			1
it has just escalated , they have no respect for anyone or anything			2
' they built up an entourage of youngsters and smashed up buses and house windows and frightened residents			1
they have been the focal point of a lot of anti-social behaviour and brought terror to their own neighbourhood because they felt comfortable doing it on their own doorstep , ' the officer @entity129 , 76 , a retired weaver , said : ' those two boys are utterly lawless and have no respect for the elders			2
we never behaved like that at their age			0
' they fight , shout and swear and jump on cars and other things			1
' they have even been banging on my door at 2am in the morning and i 've had to call the police			0
it 's frightening because i live by myself and they make everyone feel very uncomfortable in their own community , ' mrs @entity129 added			0
@entity160 , 48 , said : ' i have to carry a safety alarm with me if i go out because i am scared of them			0
i do n't tend to leave the house at night			0
' they are well known			0
they kick my doors and have done a lot of damage around here			0
they take the wheelie bins and smash stuff , they even smashed my windows with stones			1
i feel very uneasy when young lads are hanging around			0
' the order will prevent the boys from associating with four other males in a public place in @entity180 for two years			0
they are also prohibited from a mapped area of @entity180 - which also includes their residential area - unless accompanied by an adult aged 18 or over			0
local @entity186 councillor @entity185 said : ' these boys were involved in disgraceful behaviour and we have put up with these problems for too long			0
' the lads are going around making a nuisance and the community will not tolerate it			0
this is the only area in @entity180 where crime has increased , everywhere else has decreased			0
' i also believe this is the parents ' responsibility as well			0
i hope this will deter them and others too			0
residents are fed up , the boys are out every night bringing fear to the area and insulting people			0
i hope this puts them back on the straight and narrow , ' the councillor said .			0
