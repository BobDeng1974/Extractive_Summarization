published : 10:50 est , 20 august 2012 updated : 12:10 est , 20 august 2012 tragic : @entity0 lost his life after a horrific accident while exploring the site of fallen @entity5 u-boat a diver has lost his life after losing his air supply 150ft underwater while exploring the wreck of a @entity5 u-boat			1
rescue boat crew tried to resuscitate @entity0 for 30 minutes who was then taken by a rescue helicopter and raced to a pressure chamber in @entity14 but could not be saved			1
mr @entity0 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , lost his air supply 150ft down and may have suffered a fatal case of the bends as he was sent to the surface to avoid drowning			1
decompression illness - otherwise known as the ' bends ' - is when small gas bubbles form in the blood as a diver rises to the surface , blocking circulation to the brain			1
the diver was seen frantically signalling to his dive partner that he was returning to the surface			1
his partner then tried to help him upwards as he pushed him towards the surface			1
mr @entity0 was part of a seven - strong expedition visiting the remains of a u-boat which was sunk almost 100 years ago with the loss of 19 lives			1
on his @entity44 page the keen diver was excited by the trip after having a previous expedition cancelled and had been posting about his up and coming adventure			2
he wrote : ' another dive trip cancelled due to the weather			1
' we were going to @entity53 to do the @entity54 , we are still on for tomorrow though to do the @entity55			2
' i need to get to @entity57 today and get an 80 per cent fill in my stage , i was going to get it up there			2
' the @entity55 , which was destroyed by the @entity61 25 miles off the coast of @entity53 , @entity63 , in 1915 , is one of at least four submarine - wrecks which regularly attract diving expeditions			2
but the wrecks are in such deep water it can take divers on a 60 - minute trip up to half an hour to come to the surface to avoid the bends			1
@entity74 , the coxswain of @entity76 lifeboat , said : ' we were responding to a mayday from the @entity53 dive boat @entity80			1
'' one of a party of seven divers exploring the wreck of a @entity5 @entity85 had lost his air supply on the seabed			2
@entity89 diver : @entity0 lost his air supply 150ft down and may have suffered a fatal case of the bends as he was sent to the surface to avoid drowning ' his dive buddy sent him up to the surface but he was unconscious			1
' we were about an hour away and as we were about three miles from the casualty a rescue helicopter from @entity100 arrived on scene and winched the diver a board and rushed him to @entity104 in @entity14 but very sadly he was dead			2
' the @entity76 lifeboat took the mr @entity0 ’s dive buddy back to @entity53 suffering from shock where he was examined by medics			1
a rescue insider said : ' he was at a depth of about 47m ( 154ft )			2
the diver was still attached to the shot line [ safety rope ] and floated up while still attached to it			2
' deadly : this black and white photograph shows @entity116 12 before it was sunk off the coast of @entity118 the casualty was taken to @entity120 , @entity14 , which has a hyperbaric chamber - a facility which can save the lives of bends victims by artificially creating pressure and then slowly reducing it			1
the trip was organised by @entity53 - based diving company @entity127			0
they confirmed the dead diver was on their trip but declined to comment further			0
@entity132 , part of the 2008 research team which discovered @entity55 , said the trip should not have posed any unusual dangers			0
mr @entity132 , who dived on the wreck himself , said : ' it ’s not a hazardous dive			1
it ’s at a depth of 48m and is on an open sand bed - there ’s nothing overly dangerous down there			0
' he suggested the bends - the forming of nitrogen bubbles in the blood caused by pressure - may have caused the man ’s death			1
' if you ’re diving for an hour , depending on equipment and oxygen levels , you can complete it in 20 minutes , leaving you with half an hour to return to the surface			1
resting place : the wreck of @entity55 was discovered by a dive team in september 2008 ' but if you ’re down for only five minutes then you can get away with coming up quicker - it all depends on how long you ’re diving for , your depth and the oxygen you have with you			1
' it ’s a shame this diver died as result of his trip			0
a trawler spotted @entity169 early on the morning of the 10th march 1915 east of @entity170			0
three @entity172 warships , the @entity173 , the @entity174 and the @entity175 , were sent to track it down and engage it			0
the @entity178 spotted the periscope of the vessel submerged just under the surface - ramming it at full speed			1
the rusted remains of the @entity55 and her crew remained undiscovered for 93 years			0
for many years numerous locations for the wreck had been reported			0
finally , after a five year search , the @entity55 was rediscovered off the coast of @entity118 25 miles east of @entity53 following a detailed study of contemporary records of the battle			0
in january 2008 a dive was organised to explore the location which was discovered			2
' @entity127 are a popular company and those in charge really know their stuff			0
' the @entity55 - a 60m - long submarine - was attacked and sunk by three @entity61 destroyers on 10 march 1915 as it targeted cargo ships on the east coast			0
at least three other wrecked @entity5 submarines lie on the seabed off the east coast of @entity118			0
around 100 submariners perished aboard @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 , which were targeting supply ships making their way out the @entity212			0
@entity213 have launched an investigation into the man ’s death			0
a police spokesman said : ' @entity213 are investigating the sudden death of a man in his fifties after he took ill during a diving trip , which set off from @entity53 , @entity223			0
' the man was taken to @entity120 after members of his group raised the alarm around 2.30pm on sunday 19th august			0
' however , despite the best efforts of medical staff , he later passed away			0
enquiries are ongoing into the full circumstances surrounding this death			0

@entity0 , *52* , may have suffered from ' the bends '
he was seen frantically signalling to his dive partner that he was returning to the surface
