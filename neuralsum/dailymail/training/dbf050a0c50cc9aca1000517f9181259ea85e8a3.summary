@entity1 boss @entity0 has welcomed the absence of an @entity4 clash from the @entity6 quarter - final - because he reckons the hype would have disrupted his team ’s focus in their quest for @entity12 points			1
the stage was set for what would have been the first @entity16 - @entity1 game in two - and - a - half years at this week ’s last - eight draw , but instead @entity1 were paired with @entity18 at @entity19 next month while @entity21 ’s men were handed a @entity23 derby with @entity24 at @entity25			1
@entity0 , for his part , declared himself somewhat relieved that @entity28 did n’t come to pass , fearing that a month of frenzied anticipation in the build - up to the match would have distracted his players from the challenge of overhauling @entity34 at the top of the league			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 admitted he was relieved his side did n't draw @entity16 in the @entity6 ‘ we certainly were n’t pining for an @entity4 game although we would have taken whoever the cup draw gave us , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s going to be a tough game against @entity18			2
but it ’s one which can hopefully be put on the back burner a little bit			0
‘ we ’ll certainly be doing that because we ’ve got some tough league games to concentrate on before we concentrate our thoughts on the @entity6 again			2
‘ we said if we could get a home tie we would take it and we ’ve got that against a side which , on its day , is capable of giving anybody a game			2
‘ @entity18 are a really solid , hard - working team , who ended up winning the @entity55 quite comfortably last season			2
‘ as much as we ’re pleased with the draw , we ’re certainly not underestimating the task ahead of us			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) is enjoying the cup run but his priority is getting @entity1 promoted to the @entity61 @entity62 scored @entity1 ' second on tuesday in the 3 - 1 @entity6 win against @entity64 @entity19 defender @entity65 , meanwhile , insisted that @entity18 are the ideal opponents for @entity1 in their bid to make the last four as he expects them to play a more open game than the teams he ’s encountered on the way up the divisions			1
last weekend ’s 1 - 1 league draw on the plastic pitch at part - timer @entity75 was a classic example of the @entity19 men being bustled and hustled out of their stride			1
now @entity65 says he ca n’t wait for a more free - flowing game against @entity80 - who @entity1 last met in their final game in the old @entity83 in may 2012 - and believes it will bring out the best in his team as they seek their first major trophy in a knockout compeition since the 2011 @entity6 final victory over @entity16			1
@entity1 defender @entity65 ( right ) believes @entity18 are ideal @entity6 quarter - final opponents ‘ last season we were beaten in the first round but now we are in the quarter - finals and it would be good to go further if we can , ’ the @entity93 international told @entity94 ‘ we have shown we can beat anyone so we will feel confident we can do well against @entity18 - but they are a good team			1
‘ they will play football and we are at home so i think those factors combined are good for us			0
‘ when we play sides who try to play properly , we can show we can do exactly the same and i think it will suit us to play @entity18			2
next up for @entity0 's side in the @entity6 is holders @entity18 who beat @entity110 on tuesday ‘ it will be a good game to watch and hopefully we can do well			1
everyone wants to win trophies			0
last season we nearly got there and hopefully we can do it this season			0
‘ it ’s most important to win the league and to get promoted but we are still in all three cups so it would be good to win one of them			0
‘ this is a massive club			0
we know how many trophies it has won and people expect us to keep delivering			0
it would be fantastic to do that			0
’ despite his side being a league above @entity1 , @entity18 boss @entity129 believes all the expectation will be on @entity0 ’s men			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity134 ( right ) injured himself last weekend but should be back for monday 's clash with @entity136 ‘ it ’s a great draw for us because there is no pressure on us , ’ said @entity129			1
‘ it ’s a massive club against a little club			0
‘ @entity1 are doing really well at the moment and have already beaten @entity143 and @entity64 in the competition			1
‘ they have regained their form in the league after the early setback against @entity34 so they are a team that ’s used to winning			2
‘ i have seen them a couple of times and i think their improvement is down to the fact they are challenged more in the @entity12 and their players are responding to that			2
if you look at the squad they have it is one that could probably compete in the top league			0
‘ it will also be good for our players to go to @entity19 because players want to go and play huge clubs in front of big crowds and stadia that are world class			0
‘ we look at the draw and think we can beat anybody on our day			0
that ’s how we will approach it			0
there is a lot of time between now and the quarter - final but we look forward to it			1
’ old firm rivals @entity16 beat @entity34 3 - 0 in the @entity6 on wednesday to book their place in the quarter - final			1

@entity1 drew @entity18 at home in the @entity6 quarter - final
@entity0 admitted he did n't want the hype of an @entity4
the manager is prioritising the @entity12 promotion *battle* with @entity34
@entity1 beat @entity64 3 - 1 on tuesday to book their place in the last eight
