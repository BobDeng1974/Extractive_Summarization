by @entity0 opposition : the findings are a setback for @entity5 leader @entity4 , who has made declining living standards of the ' squeezed middle ' one of his party ¿ s main attacks on the government middle class families weathered the recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets , using grandparents for free childcare and taking on extra jobs , a report published today reveals			1
households in the social group became ‘ very good ’ at adapting their spending and employment in order to ride out the crisis , says research by a think - tank			1
some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn			1
the findings are a setback for @entity5 leader @entity4 , who has made declining living standards of the ‘ squeezed middle ’ one of his party ’s main attacks on the government			1
instead , data from the @entity36 paints a picture of the group that has most successfully dealt with the economic fallout since the crash of 2007 - 8			0
more women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet , with the proportion of double - income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per cent			1
an analysis of household income also found that the middle classes became bargain seekers , switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 per cent increase in food prices			1
and there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to cut the cost of a childminder or nursery			0
middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘ free ’ care for the under - twos than they were in 2007 , says the report			1
around one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income of between £ 26,100 and £ 41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result of the financial crisis			1
but two - fifths stayed where they were , and the remaining two - fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets			2
@entity79 , director of the @entity36 , said : ‘ families in the middle have adapted to evade the squeeze			2
the super-consumers among them have beaten the market , managing their costs so that they rise by less than inflation			0
adapting : many families saved money on childcare by asking grandparents to look after their children ‘ @entity4 has said that the greatest challenge for our generation is restoring the living standards of the middle class , while many on the conservative benches have been pushing for middle class tax cuts by the election			1
‘ in reality the middle has coped surprisingly well since 2007 - 08			2
we found that even in the teeth of the recession , two - fifths of them moved up the income distribution			2
just as many managed to stay where they were			2
’ he added : ‘ by 2011 - 12 , the middle as a whole had the same earnings in real terms as they did in 2007 - 08			0
with the recovery under way , their prospects are likely to improve further			0
’ the @entity116 says its economic measures – including dramatic increases in the personal tax allowance , which reached £ 10,000 this week – have benefited millions of middle earners			0
however , interest rate rises could be a cloud on the horizon , the report suggests			0
it reveals how more than half of the households in middle income brackets own their own homes , meaning that low interest rates remain critical for their ability to sustain their current standard of living			1
some 10 per cent of families in the middle also fell behind on their rent or mortgage payments			0
mr @entity79 warned : ‘ for the rest , the big question is whether the rise in their incomes will outpace the rise in interest rates			0
that ’s how it looks for the moment , not least because the @entity146 is showing a high level of caution in raising rates			0

some managed to move into higher income bracket despite downturn
households became very good at ' adapting ' spending
