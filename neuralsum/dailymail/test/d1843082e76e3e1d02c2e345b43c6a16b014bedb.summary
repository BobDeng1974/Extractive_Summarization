@entity0 is finally feeling like a senior member of the @entity3 squad under @entity10 the 29 - year - old moved to @entity5 in june 2011 from @entity6 and feels he has a role to play at @entity3 ' to be honest , a few of my team - mates have mentioned my name when they talk about characters and jokers and it 's always nice to hear that			1
you have got to have good team spirit and we have got that here			2
' there are people who like to mess about and do different things in the dressing room			2
there are big characters in the dressing room and everyone gets on with everybody else			0
the team spirit we have got here is brilliant			0
' @entity0 had to be patient but the winger says easing himself in was only natural when he had to meet his new team - mates and get used to a different dressing room			1
' when i first came here , i knew a few of the lads from playing with them for @entity46 but i did n't really know what to expect , ' @entity0 added			2
' when you settle in properly at a club , your character starts to come out more and more			0
' with me , i 'm always there or thereabouts when there is any mucking about or things going on in the dressing room			0

' when you 've got @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity76 leaving , individuals who were not only big characters but captains , people have to step up and take over that mantle , ' @entity0 stated			1

you give out more advice and try to help the youngsters along but it 's everybody 's job really			0
