startup company @entity2 promises to ' dispatch a professional caregiver ' to deliver prompt delivery of a range of different strains of cannabis to clients across @entity9			1
they claim to be able to deliver the package within ten minutes to anyone who lives in the @entity20 after they register for the ' on - demand healthcare delivery service '			1
within days of its launch , the firm was widely compared to @entity25 - an app which allows customers to book and track taxis on their mobile phone			2
@entity2 offers the same technology , letting users watch their caregiver 's progress as they drive to their home			1
delivery is a free service for patients , with money to pay drivers reportedly coming from revenue that @entity1 takes in from dispensaries for generating extra business			2
' we 're offering the revolution of on - demand services for medical marijuana patients , ' said @entity2 ceo and founder @entity48 , formerly an executive at enterprise social network @entity50 , which was acquired by @entity52 for $ 1.2 billion			1
he says his app has automated the generally ' slow , cumbersome , and unpredictable ' process of checking dispensaries and confirming eligibility			0
' ' the process of acquiring medical marijuana can be slow , cumbersome and unpredictable , ' he said			1
' often patients have to search multiple dispensaries manually each time they order as stock often varies			0
' verification of medical eligibility can take 24 hours and has to be repeated with each dispensary			2
@entity2 ’s technology automates all of that so each patient can have a consistent , comfortable experience -- and can focus on getting better			2
' classified : marijuana remains classified as a @entity69 by the government , but pot entrepreneurship is growing			2
so is legalization of marijuana - currently 23 states and the @entity74 allow medical pot use each driver will start a shift by picking up a kit at a dispensary preloaded with 8 ounces of pot - the legal limit they can carry			1
typical sales are one - eighth ounce , or 3.5 grams , which sells for about $ 50			2
' having ( enough supply for ) 64 deliveries on them means they can get to patients in an average time of 10 minutes , ' @entity48 said			2
' that 's a compelling value proposition			0
' @entity1 will verify customers ' legal rights to buy marijuana by reviewing images of their doctors ' notes and drivers ' licenses , submitted online			0
drivers ' cars will be unmarked - important because they must accept cash for deliveries , due to strict federal rules regulating banks and credit card companies			0
the service will be in operation daily from 8 a.m. to midnight			0
drivers will make $ 10 per delivery			0
@entity48 would n't say how much @entity1 would collect as a commission from dispensaries			0
' on - demand healthcare ' : the company 's website ( pictured ) claims to be able to deliver the package within ten minutes to anyone who lives in the @entity20 after they register for the ' on - demand healthcare delivery service ' drivers must pass criminal and driving background checks and must themselves be medical marijuana users so they are legally allowed to carry 8 ounces			1
' we want them to be able to relate to the patients , ' @entity48 said			0
revolution : @entity2 ceo and founder @entity48 says he is ' offering the revolution of on - demand services for medical marijuana patients ' @entity48 says they wo n't drive under the influence - and that the company is considering some form of drug tests for employees			1
' we do n't have a protocol yet , but plan to do it , ' he said			0
according to @entity48 , @entity1 carries insurance in addition to the drivers ' personal policies , but the company did not respond to a request for more details on the amount and type of its policies			0
while currently , the company only operates around @entity9 , @entity149 says he plans soon to move into southern @entity151 , then to @entity74 and @entity152			1
but his grand vision involves a vast network of caregivers across the country who deliver marijuana to patients in all states where the drug is legal			1
he added : ' although the healing effects of marijuana have been researched and documented , the medicine is still subject to much controversy			0
' it ’s a shame that patients requiring marijuana for chronic illnesses are often stigmatized			0
at @entity2 , we developed technology to make it easier and quicker for patients to receive their medicine through professional delivery experiences			1
' @entity1 , however , already faces stiff competition in this apparent emerging market and is not the only startup which offers such a service			0
just last week it was reported that two 19 - year - old students at the @entity180 in @entity181 launched a phone app to deliver cannabis to medical - marijuana users			1
@entity185 and @entity186 also describe their business , called @entity188 , as ‘ @entity25 for marijuana			0
’ the app allows medical - marijuana cardholders to select different strains of pot from different medical dispensaries and then have it delivered by a cardholding driver			1
another company , called @entity198 , also offers a near - identical service in @entity200			2
marijuana remains classified as a @entity69 by the government , but pot entrepreneurship is growing			0
so is legalization of marijuana - currently 23 states and the @entity74 allow medical pot use .			1

currently @entity2 only operates in @entity9 but chief has @entity210 - wide vision
it promises to ' dispatch a professional caregiver ' to deliver prompt delivery
even claims to be able to deliver the package within ten minutes to any home
the service caters only for medical marijuana users who register with @entity2
