an ancient @entity1 kingdom close to the @entity2 collapsed more than 4,200 years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change , according to new research			1
during @entity9 ’s @entity8 - the pyramid - building time - 4,200 years ago , droughts and fires plagued the region , causing famine and social unrest			1
scientists examined 7,000 - year - old ancient pollen and charcoal samples from the @entity2 to piece together the time - and found evidence of a ' mega drought ' in the the area			1
the @entity19 in @entity20 was built by @entity1 between 2560 ¿ @entity21 @entity22 , of the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , said : ' even the mighty builders of the ancient pyramids more than 4,000 years ago fell victim when they were unable to respond to a changing climate			2
' this study illustrates that water availability was the climate - change @entity30 then for @entity9 , as it may well be now , for a planet topping seven billion thirsty people			0
' the researchers examined the presence and amount of charcoal , as fires increase during times of drought leaving charcoal in the geological records			1
the temple of @entity44 was built after the mega drought observed in the geological records they also found large reductions of wetland pollen , signifying far fewer plants grew , and increases in microscopic charcoal occurred during four different periods between 3,000 and 6,000 years ago			1
one of those events was the abrupt and global mega-drought around 4,200 years ago , which led to famines and probably played a role in the end of @entity9 ’s @entity8 and affected other @entity60 cultures			0
these events are also recorded in history - the first about 5,000 years ago when the unification of @entity64 and @entity9 happened and the @entity65 in modern @entity66 collapsed , the @entity62 study says			0
the second event 3,000 years ago took place in the eastern @entity60 and is associated with the fall of the @entity72 and famines in the @entity75 and @entity76 kingdoms			0
@entity77 , of the @entity23 , said : ' humans have a long history of having to deal with climate change			0
the aftermath of the drought and sandstorms which destroyed the @entity1 @entity8 around @entity84 was shown in the @entity86 's @entity85 ' along with other research , this study geologically reveals that the evolution of societies is sometimes tied to climate variability at all scales - whether decadal or millennial			2
' professor @entity93 , of the @entity94 , said : ' the study geologically demonstrates that when deciphering past climates , pollen and other micro-organisms , such as charcoal , can augment or verify written or archaeological records - or they can serve as the record itself if other information does n’t exist or is not continuous			0

researchers analysed pollen and charcoal levels in the @entity2 and found evidence of *massive* fires and few crops
@entity112 led to famine and demise of the @entity1
