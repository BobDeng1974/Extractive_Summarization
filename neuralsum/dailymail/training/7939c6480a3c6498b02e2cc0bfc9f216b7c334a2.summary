@entity1 manager @entity0 believes the pressure will be on for @entity3 to deliver at @entity4 next season			1
@entity0 will pit his wits against the new @entity4 boss this week when his @entity1 side take on @entity9 in an international friendly in @entity11 on wednesday			1
@entity4 have turned to @entity12 , who is stepping down as @entity9 coach after this summer 's @entity14 , to revive their fortunes after a disappointing season under @entity17			1
waiting game : @entity9 boss @entity3 will take over at @entity4 after the @entity14 @entity0 said : ' it will be interesting to see what happens if @entity4 go through next season not winning anything because there is that possibility			1
' regardless of how easy they look on the eye if they have n't won anything what are they going to do ? ' they are used to winning things and bossing situations and last season they did n't do that			0
' i thought it would be hard for @entity39 in the first year or two and i was disappointed as a fellow manager that he only got 10 months			0
' i want to see what happens next season because @entity3 is a quality manager but what are we going to say next year if @entity4 have not won anything ? ' is @entity3 going to be out the door because he is going to need time to bed in with his own ideas			1
' you are not a magician when you are a manager			0
sometimes you go in and have an immediate response and that is good but sometimes you do n't and it takes time - if you get the time - to try to mould it and do it your own way			0
' that was what @entity17 was trying to do and i was disappointed because he is a @entity62 manager and we want to see them do well like @entity65 ( @entity66 ) at @entity67			1
he had a season and then he got it right			0
' @entity12 with all his experience i am quite sure he can do well there but it will be interesting to see how it works			0
' pressure : @entity1 boss @entity0 is convinced @entity12 will have to deliver results instantly at @entity4 @entity0 has the highest respect for @entity12 , 62 , who has also managed - and won titles with - @entity77 giants @entity76 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
@entity0 is hoping his side can give the @entity81 a good test in what will be a final run out for @entity12 's men ahead of the @entity14			1
@entity9 are due to fly out to @entity86 on thursday			0
@entity0 said : ' i 've never done battle with him , so to speak , but i have been on a couple of seminars when he 's been there and he is a good manager			1
' he is very innovative			0
he is one of those managers where it is how it is , that is what he believes and you go along with the ride with him but if you do n't agree then you are not on the same journey and i think you find yourself on a different journey pretty quickly			2
' i have been doing this for 10 years and it is a hard industry and the ones who are the best managers , the most successful , i look at them and i have a lot of respect and admiration for them			0
' he is up there because he has won all the big things and he has been at a lot of big clubs and now he is going to go to one of the biggest clubs and he is someone i respect a lot			0
' axed : @entity17 was axed at @entity4 after less than a season in charge following poor results wales are without some of their main stars , most notably @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , but @entity0 still feels the match is a useful exercise for this squad			1
the uncapped trio of defenders @entity130 and @entity132 , of @entity133 and @entity134 respectively , and @entity4 midfielder @entity135 could be among those to feature at the @entity137			2
@entity1 ' next match in september will be their opening @entity139 qualifier in @entity141			2
@entity0 said : ' my point is we need to give all of these guys experience of playing international football because you never know when you are going to have to call on them			2
' missing : @entity1 will be without a host of big names against @entity9 including @entity122			2
