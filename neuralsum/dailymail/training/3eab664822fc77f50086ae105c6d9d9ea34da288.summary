by @entity1 reporter published : 21:36 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 05:04 est , 29 august 2013 scientists have made a major breakthrough in determining the cause of age - related memory loss , which they hope will herald the development of a new drug to reverse the process			1
a report released yesterday offers strong evidence that age - related memory loss really is a distinct condition from @entity12 's — and might eventually be treatable			1
researchers at @entity14 examined brains , young and old ones , donated from people who died without signs of neurologic disease			2
scientists believe they have pinpointed the cause of memory loss offering a breakthrough that could lead to the development of drugs to reverse the process they discovered that a certain gene in a specific part of the hippocampus , the brain 's memory center , stops working properly in older people			1
it produces less of a key protein			0
that section of the brain , called the dentate gyrus , has long been suspected of being especially vulnerable to aging			0
importantly , it 's a different neural neighborhood than where @entity38 's begins to form			0
but it 's circumstantial evidence that having less of that protein , named @entity42 , affects memory loss in older adults			1
so the researchers took a closer look at mice , which become forgetful as they age in much the same way that people do			2
sure enough , cutting levels of the protein made healthy young rodents lose their way in mazes and perform worse on other memory tasks just like old mice naturally do			0
clue : a certain gene in a specific part of the hippocampus , the brain 's memory center , was found to stop working properly in older people more intriguing , the memory loss was reversible : boosting the protein made forgetful old mice as sharp as the youngsters again , the researchers reported in the journal @entity68			1
' it 's the best evidence so far ' that age - related memory loss is n't the same as early @entity38 , said @entity73 laureate dr. @entity72 , who led the @entity74 since some people make it to 100 without showing much of a cognitive slowdown , the work begs another question : ' is that normal aging , or is it a deterioration that we 're allowing to occur ? ' @entity72 said			1
' as we want to live longer and stay engaged in a cognitively complex world , i think even mild age - related memory decline is meaningful , ' added @entity14 neurologist dr. @entity86 , a senior author of the study			1
' it opens up a whole avenue of investigation to now try to identify interventions			0
' this is early - stage research that will require years of additional work to confirm , cautioned dr. @entity95 of the @entity96 , who was n't involved with the report			0
but @entity95 said the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting ' that we 're not all on the road to alzheimer 's disease ' after we pass a certain age			2
for example , other researchers have found that connections between neurons in other parts of the brain weaken with normal aging , making it harder but not impossible to retrieve memories			0
in contrast , @entity38 's kills neurons			0
how does wednesday 's research fit ? many pathways make up a smoothly functioning memory , and that protein plays a role in turning a short - term memory — like where you left those car keys — into a longer - term one , @entity72 explained			2
some good news : scientists already know that exercise makes the dentate gyrus — that age - targeted spot in the hippocampus — function better , @entity86 said			1
he 's also studying if nutrition might make a difference .			0

new evidence suggests age - related memory loss is a distinct condition from @entity12 's
certain gene in the brain 's memory centre stops working properly in older people
