thousands of men and women who regularly drink just three glasses of wine a day could be given a £ 3 pill to help them cut back under @entity6 guidelines			1
they urge @entity8 to prescribe the drug nalmefene to up to 600,000 adults in @entity11 deemed to be mild alcoholics			1
many may not even consider themselves heavy drinkers and simply look forward to a few glasses of wine at evenings and weekends			0
the @entity6 ’s safe drinking limits are 2 to 3 units a day for women and 3 to 4 for men - there are just over two units in a medium glass of wine or pint of beer			1
women who drink five units a day and men seven and a half - and who struggle to get by without it - could be offered the pill			1
over the last decade deaths from liver disease have soared by a fifth and there were 4,425 in 2012 – mostly in the middle age			1
alcohol is also known to increase the risk of many cancers and it also raises the blood pressure which can cause stroke and heart disease			2
the pill works by reducing the amount of the chemical dopamine released by the brain , which is responsible for the reward or ‘ buzz ’ feeling			0
it enables adults to enjoy one or two drinks and then stop without needing more			1
for this reason it would mean they would n’t have to go tee - total but could continue drinking socially at far lower levels			0
it would enable adults to have one drink socially but then stop without needing more and more			1
the guidance - which is provisional – tells doctors to prescribe the pill for a maximum of six months alongside counselling sessions such as with @entity74			2
if all were to take the pill – on average every other day when they needed – for six months it would cost more than £ 150 million			2
by comparison , the @entity6 spends an estimated £ 3.5 billion annually treating patients for alcohol misuse			2
@entity81 , chief executive of the @entity82 , said : ‘ the range of people who put themselves at risk through their drinking is quite wide			2
@entity87 would enable adults to enjoy one or two drinks and then stop without needing more ‘ some have not yet experienced social problems and are functioning well until they develop an alcohol - related physical illness such as high blood pressure , cancer or liver disease ; while others lose their social supports and then tend to fit the stereotype of the ‘ alcoholic ’			1
‘ reducing alcohol consumption can prevent these social and physical damages developing			0
’ professor @entity102 , consultant psychiatrist at @entity103 , who specialises in alcohol dependence said : ‘ although for many people dependent on alcohol , abstinence is the preferred and optimal goal , nalmefene represents an alternative step , helping people to cut down drinking to less harmful levels when they are not ready and have no medical need to give up alcohol altogether			1
’ @entity8 are told to identify heavy drinker patients through a series of questions during routine appointments or when they first register with a practice			0
the @entity6 ’s safe drinking limits are 2 to 3 units a day for women and 3 to 4 for men - there are just over two units in a medium glass of wine or pint of beer these include how many units to you drink in a typical week and how often do you go over the recommended safe units of 2 to 3 for a woman 3 to 4 for a man			1
doctors are also encouraged to look out for warning signs of heavy drinking such as a high blood pressure , insomnia , feeling low and a ruddy complexion			0
trials involving 700 patients have found that taking the pill for six months reduced the average alcohol consumption from nine units to three units a day			1
the number of days patients drank heavily more than halved from 18 days a month to just eight			0
professor @entity151 , @entity152 , said : ‘ alcohol dependence is a serious issue for many people			0
‘ those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor , engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes			0
‘ we are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence ‘ when used alongside psychosocial support nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the @entity6 compared with psychosocial support alone			2
’ @entity22 recommends that the drug is prescribed for a maximum of six months after which it is hoped patients would have cut back on their drinking with the additional help of counselling			1
it can cause unpleasant side effects such as sickness , dizziness , headaches and sleeping problems			0
@entity184 , chief executive of @entity185 , said : ‘ it is important that there is a variety of treatments available to support people who want help with their alcohol dependency			0
‘ the introduction of nalmefene will be a useful addition to the clinician ’s toolbox , when used in conjunction with other treatment methods to tackle the harmful consequences of alcohol misuse			0
