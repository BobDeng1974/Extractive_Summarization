if the infamous it ’s a @entity2 show is becoming a faded memory , here ’s why ... prince @entity5 turns 50 today			1
to mark the occasion @entity7 have issued a charming new portrait of the @entity5 , the title he was granted on his marriage , his wife , @entity12 , the @entity12 and their two children @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity17			1
taken in in the panelled dining room in their @entity21 home , @entity23 , by photographer @entity24 , who also took the private photographs at the @entity26 and @entity27 of @entity29 ’s wedding , it is a particularly relaxed family portrait			1
to mark @entity5 's 50th birthday , @entity7 have issued a charming new portrait of the @entity5 , the title he was granted on his marriage , his wife , @entity12 , the @entity12 and their two children @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity17 the royal couple dressed smartly to celebrate their youngest son 's half century birthday the @entity39 wore a pearl necklace and matching earrings and a bright red lipstick to go with her cream coat the @entity39 and the @entity26 arrive at @entity23 , @entity44 for prince @entity45 50th @entity5 , dressed in a lilac shirt unbuttoned at the neck to display a hint of hairy chest , and bottle green trousers sits holding his giggling son , six , on the arm of his chair			1
his daughter , ten , wearing a grey pinafore and white jumper clutches his arm affectionately , while his wife of almost 15 years , @entity12 , smiles broadly as she crouches behind			2
aside from the release of the official portrait , the prince has determinedly refused to make a big deal of out his landmark birthday , granting a single interview to a children ’s news programme			2
he will , however , conduct two public engagements with his wife in support of the @entity71 , the charity the couple set up shortly before their marriage in 1999			0
the couple will then accompany the queen and other senior royals to the @entity77 at @entity78			0
in recent years @entity5 , often cited as the @entity39 ’s favoured son , has become something of the quiet man of the @entity83 monarchy , conducting 258 engagements last year with little fanfare			1
he is also considered the successor to his father ’s @entity89 scheme and been handed the plum role of @entity91 and chairman of the @entity93			0
this has resulted in him becoming one of the most well - travelled members of the royal family last year			2
in 2013 he conducted 87 engagement overseas , bettered only by his wife - who carried out 95 - and prince @entity100 , who also clocked up 95 jobs but undertook two lengthy foreign tours on behalf of the @entity83 government			2
the couple were in @entity105 and @entity106 only last week			0
it is , perhaps , seen as a reward for years of quiet service after being forced to give up his chosen career			0
lord @entity112 arrives at @entity23 , @entity44 for prince @entity45 50th @entity113 @entity115 and @entity116 , first cousin once removed of @entity39 , arrive at @entity23 after leaving university , @entity5 famously joined the @entity118 but dropped out of training within months			1
he decided to pursue a career in entertainment , starting off as a production assistant for @entity124 ’s @entity123 but also produced the ill - fate it ’s a @entity2 in 1987			0
in 1993 he formed his own company , @entity126 , but was accused of profiting out of his position by making a series of royal documentaries the company made a series of losses until , in 2001 , one of his own film crews invaded his nephew , prince @entity137 ’s privacy , while he was studying in @entity138 by secretly filming him , causing a public – and private – furore			2
the following year it was announced that he and his wife , whose own pr business had been similarly dogged by controversy , would give up their business interests to concentrate on their royal duties			0
friends , however , say @entity5 , who is now eighth - in - line to the throne , is happy and relaxed in his new role as a dutiful son and now father			1

one friend said : ‘ it really is lovely to see @entity5 and @entity12 sitting down on the floor playing with their children			1
they are such hand - on parents and totally unstuffy			0
@entity166 and @entity16 were much longed - for children and are the centre of their world			0
