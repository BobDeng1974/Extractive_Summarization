by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 6 february 2013 @entity2 : 10:12 est , 7 february 2013 the world will have a 30 minute warning when a once - in - a - century solar ' superstorm ' strikes the @entity7 knocking out major communications , scientists revealed			1
superstorms occur every 200 years , with the last storm striking in 1859 , and scientists are preparing for the event which could paralyze communications networks including gps and mobile phones			1
the news comes as it is revealed a new body of space experts is needed to help protect @entity19 from the storm			1
the @entity21 has said that the massive radiation blast is inevitable and that the government should set up a @entity19 @entity24			1
danger : scientists have called for action to protect @entity19 for a one - in - a - century solar superstorm the quango would lead and supervise government strategy for coping with the @entity32 storm that could trigger black - outs , knock out one in 10 satellites , and disrupt aircraft and shipping navigation			1
although solar weather events happen on a regular basis , the @entity7 has not experienced a superstorm since the start of the space age			1
on that occasion , @entity7 was hit by a tidal wave of energetic particles following a large solar flare			0
induced currents caused by the blast sent sparks flying from telegraph pylons and caused fires			2
around the world , night skies were lit up by magnificent aurora displays			0
but at that time there were no satellites in orbit or sensitive microchips in the path of the particles			2
experts now warn that another solar superstorm on the scale of the @entity65 event is ' inevitable ' and @entity19 should be prepared			1
professor @entity66 , who chaired the @entity21 's working group on extreme solar weather , said : ' the two challenges for government are the wide spectrum of technologies affected today and the emergence of unexpected vulnerabilities as technology evolves			2
' @entity76 recommends that government sets up a @entity24 to oversee these issues across government departments			2
radiation blast : a solar superstorm could trigger black - outs and knock out one in 10 satellites ' our message is : do n't panic , but do prepare - a solar superstorm will happen one day and we need to be ready for it			1
' around one in 10 orbiting satellites could be knocked out for days during a superstorm event , said the report			1
those that keep operating would be aged ' enormously ' , making it necessary for many to be replaced			0
gps signals would be interrupted one to three days after the storm hit as satellite transmissions to the ground are disrupted			0
as a result sat - nav systems would be rendered inoperable			2
navigating officers in aircraft and ships would temporarily have to revert to old - fashioned ' dead reckoning ' , said prof @entity66			1
his advice to motorists was ' make sure you continue to keep a map in your car '			0
energetic particles penetrating lower levels of the atmosphere could also interfere with aircraft electronics			2
space engineer @entity115 , from the @entity116 , another member of the working group , said : ' the most likely scenario is that data elements get corrupted			0
it 's possible that individual chips could fail			0
the systems are designed to cope with a certain amount of failure			0
threat : a superstorm could cause problems for aircraft by knocking out their navigation systems ' what would be of concern is if we had multiple failures for the pilot to deal with so he becomes overloaded			1
' but he added : ' we 're not talking about aircraft dropping out of the sky			0
' other effects of a solar superstorm would be to send large induced currents through the electricity grid network , potentially knocking out central transformers and causing blackouts			0
for passengers on high flying aircraft , a superstorm would also deliver a radiation dose equivalent to three ct scans			1
this would still be below harmful levels , said the experts - but astronauts aboard the @entity155 could be at risk			1
a solar superstorm would have proved lethal for the @entity159 astronauts had one occurred when they were on the @entity161			0
currently an ageing satellite called @entity163 ( @entity163 ) provides around 15 minutes warning of a @entity165 ( @entity165 ) - a huge plasma cloud of charged particles that causes the most damage during a solar storm			0
scientists are concerned about what will happen if @entity163 fails			0
a replacement for @entity163 , called @entity173 , is due to be launched by the @entity175 space agency @entity174 in 2014 .			0

experts warn that superstorm is ' inevitable ' and call for @entity19 to be prepared
they want a quango to lead government strategy for coping with the blast
it could trigger black - outs , knock out satellites and disrupt aircraft and ships
the last superstorm was known as the @entity65 event and was in 1859
