by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 09:02 est , 8 march 2013 a young judge who was repeatedly raped by guards at a concentration camp in @entity5 has helped to put her perpetrators behind bars			1
@entity8 was one of 37 women who suffered the nightly traumas in @entity12 concentration camp - they never discussed their abuse - their pained glances were enough to communicate their suffering			1
but it was partly thanks to ms @entity8 's efforts to gather testimony from women across @entity5 that rape was categorised as a war crime under international law			1
trauma : @entity8 stands at the gate of @entity12 , an iron ore mine outside her native town of @entity27 , 250 kms west of @entity28 thirty people have been convicted at the international war crimes tribunal in the @entity31 and another 30 cases are ongoing			1
she personally helped put the man who raped her repeatedly during her two months in captivity behind bars			2
but the journey was not easy for ms @entity8 - there were days when she prayed for a bullet to end her suffering			1
when she thought she was dying of a heart attack , she whispered ' thank you @entity42			0
' she also witnessed murder and torture by @entity46 guards - and was forced to clean blood from walls and floors of the interrogation room			1
endurance : the journey was not easy for @entity8 - there were days when she prayed for a bullet to end her suffering			1
when she thought she was dying of a heart attack , she whispered ' thank you @entity42 ' she told herself to memorise the names and faces of the tormentors so that one day she might bring them to justice			0
' most of the strength i took from the idea that one day this evil would be over , ' she told @entity66 this week ahead of @entity67 on friday			0
the @entity69 special representative on sexual violence in conflict said @entity8 and other victims are helping to make sure wartime rapists pay for their crimes			1
' the courage these women have shown coming forward and sharing their stories demonstrates the need to break the silence and stigma surrounding sexual violence in conflict , ' said @entity82			0
' these survivors are helping to end impunity by making sure perpetrators are brought to justice			0
' @entity5 's 1992 - 95 war was the bloodiest in the series of armed conflicts that erupted when the @entity91 federation fell apart and its republics began declaring independence			1
it took over 100,000 lives and devastated the region			0
deprived : @entity98 men at @entity12 detention camp in @entity5 - the same camp that @entity8 was held in according to the @entity69 , between 20,000 to 50,000 @entity5 women were raped - many in special rape camps - during the war that was fought between the new country 's @entity104 , @entity106 and @entity5			1
@entity108 conflicts have seen even more harrowing figures : between 250,000 and 500,000 were raped during the @entity111 genocide , and hundreds of thousands more in conflicts in @entity113 and the @entity114			1
ms @entity8 's ordeal started in the spring of 1992 when @entity46 took control over her native @entity27 , in the northwest of @entity5 and threw @entity118 in concentration camps			1
alongside the women were 3,500 male prisoners , hundreds of whom were killed			0
@entity8 , a @entity122 , would start the day counting the bodies of the men who were tortured to death overnight			2
they were often taken to the notorious ' @entity127 ' in the centre of the camp			2
' their bodies lay there in the grass in front of the building			0
sometimes 20 , sometimes 30 of them , ' she recalled outside the factory in @entity12 where she was held for two months			2
the notorious ' @entity127 ' at the former @entity12 concentration camp			1
then the guards would force the women to clean the interrogation rooms strewn with bloody pliers and batons during the long days of forced labor in the camp 's restaurant , the women listened to tortured prisoners screaming , calling for help and begging for mercy with voices that would become weaker until they went silent			1
then the guards would force the women to clean the interrogation rooms , strewn with bloody pliers and batons			1
at night , guards would come to take the women away one by one - to rape			2
her captivity ended in august 1992 when a group of foreign journalists found the facility			2
the images of skeletal prisoners behind a fence and naked bodies beaten black and blue shocked the world and prompted an avalanche of reactions that forced the @entity104 leadership to release the prisoners			2
@entity175 : forensic experts examine remains of human bodies , discovered at mass grave site in village of @entity181			0
@entity182 of @entity184 inmates of notorious @entity104 's @entity12 detention camp were found here ms @entity8 's pre-war colleague from the @entity27 court , prosecutor @entity188 , was also among the 37 @entity12 women			1
remembrance : a @entity5 woman prays in a concentration camp in @entity12 last year during the 20th anniversary of the closing of the camps the two escaped to neighboring @entity106 , where they began collecting testimonies from hundreds of women who had been raped			1
they spent years transcribing testimonies , convincing victims to break their silence and putting together legal dossiers which they then presented to the investigators at the @entity204 in @entity205 , based in the @entity31			0
during this process , she said , ' it became obvious how many women from all over @entity5 were affected			2
but i was n't surprised by the big number			0
' for centuries , rape was considered a byproduct of wars - collateral damage suffered by women , horrors often overshadowed by massacres			2
even though the @entity220 of 1949 prohibited wartime rape , no court ever raised charges until ms @entity8 and ms @entity188 presented their overwhelming evidence			2
the effort finally paid off in june 1995 when the two traveled to the @entity31 to take part in preparations for the first indictment by the @entity91 war crimes court			0
their collected evidence exposed the magnitude of rape which courts could no longer ignore			0
according to the @entity69 , it was a major ' turning point ' in recognising rape as a war crime			0
ms @entity8 remembers the sunny july day the two realised their work would be soon rewarded			2
they enjoyed a coffee in an outdoor cafe in the @entity31 and wrote a few postcards back to their torturers in @entity27			0
determined : @entity8 has testified in several cases , including against @entity46 leader @entity246 ' @entity248 , ' they wrote			1
' we hope you will soon join us in this wonderful city			0
' a year later , the tribunal indicted eight @entity46 men for sexual assault in eastern @entity5 - a verdict based on testimonies collected by ms @entity8 and ms @entity188			1
it was the first time in history that an international tribunal charged someone solely for crimes of sexual violence			0
@entity263 , spokeswoman for the @entity91 war crimes court , recalls the ' shocking ' testimony in subsequent cases where some victims were as young as 12			0
' we had cases were both mother and daughter came to testify and both were subjected to same kind of torture and kind of crimes , ' she said			0
ms @entity8 who has since testified in several cases , including against @entity46 leader @entity246 , is satisfied with what she has achieved , although she wishes the ongoing cases would accelerate			1
' it 's slow , very slow , ' she said			0
' but it is a start			0
' one of the @entity12 guards she testified against was released in 2005 after he served two - thirds of his seven - year sentence			1
ms @entity8 ran into him on the street one day in @entity5			1
' we stared at each other , ' she said			0
' he was the first one to lower his head			0
