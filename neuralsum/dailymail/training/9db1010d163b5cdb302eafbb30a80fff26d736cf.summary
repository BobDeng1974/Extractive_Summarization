by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 10:39 est , 13 april 2012 @entity2 's rocket scientists have been forced to hang their heads in collective shame following the spectacular failure of their latest long - range missile which blew up moments after launch			1
military leaders had hoped to show off their nation 's technological prowess by blasting a satellite into orbit in what the @entity14 had called a covert test of missile technology and a flagrant violation of international resolutions			2
but in deeply embarrassing episode for the communist country and its new leader @entity25 , the @entity21 , or ' @entity22 ' , rocket exploded 90 seconds after blast off and came crashing down into the @entity27			1
according to @entity51 defence officials , the rocket flared brightly and apparently exploded about 90 seconds into flight			2
in the past @entity2 have always declared their launches successful despite evidence to the contrary from the international community			0
but there are expected to be severe repercussions following the failure of the mission which was supposed to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of national founder @entity65			0
' this is the first crisis for the new leader that has just taken over , ' said @entity69 , a professor at @entity70 in @entity71			0
' it is inevitable that they will look to find who is responsible for the failure , and i wonder what the treatment will be for those in the military and the hard - line officers who have pressed for the launch			0
' upset : @entity25 attends the @entity83 of the @entity84 prior to the launch yesterday this is what it should have looked like : a @entity90 woman watches a tv news report showing a computer generated image of the rocket blasting off successfully @entity2 had planned to make 2012 the year in which it became a ' strong and prosperous nation ' and the launch was part of a programme to burnish its credentials			1
it even , unusually , invited foreign media in to cover the birthday celebrations and showed them the launch site			0
@entity25 was named first secretary of the @entity84 on wednesday , as he accumulates titles and posts similar to those held by his father , @entity110 who died in december			2
the country is one of the most tightly controlled states on earth , with no free media and a tight grip on its population			0
worryingly some spectators have suggested the failure will prompt @entity2 to press ahead with its third nuclear test to show its military strength			1
a senior @entity90 defence ministry official told a parliamentary hearing : ' the possibility of an additional long - range rocket launch or a nuclear test , as well as a military provocation to strengthen internal solidarity is very high			1
' the two koreas are divided by the world 's most militarised border and remain technically at war after an armistice ended the @entity135 in 1953			0
' defiant : @entity25 went ahead with the unveiling of a statue of his father @entity138 intended to cap ' triumph ' of rocket launch pride : worryingly some spectators have suggested the failure will prompt @entity2 to press ahead with its third nuclear test to show its military strength noisy neighbours : @entity90 look towards the @entity2 side for any signs of the launch with binoculars at the @entity151 , near the demilitarized zone the launch came just weeks after a ' @entity155 ' deal that saw @entity156 agree to provide food aid			1
among the promises @entity30 made in return was not to launch any long range rocket or undertake nuclear tests			1
in response to the launch the @entity51 has now cancelled a planned food aid deal with the rogue state			2
a @entity168 official , aboard @entity166 , told reporters : ' we are not going forward with any agreement to provide them with assistance			0
' there is likely to be pressure from leading countries to impose more sanctions on the @entity2			0
but it poses difficulties for @entity179 which will likely resist further sanctions even though its own diplomacy failed to stop the rocket launch			2
' after giving so much aid to @entity2 , it still did not listen to @entity179 , and this hurt @entity179 - @entity2 relations and erodes domestic support in its continued support of @entity2 , ' said @entity189 , a professor and regional security expert at @entity192 's @entity191			2
' this also undermines confidence in the @entity51 - @entity179 relationship , and whether @entity179 had done enough to persuade the @entity2			1
so , @entity179 is also a loser , but not as big a loser as if @entity2 succeeded in its launch , ' he said			2
a tough push for sanctions , which @entity202 prime minister @entity201 pledged , could lead a show of defiance from the @entity2 such as a nuclear test , or an attack like the one in 2010 that saw it shell a @entity90 island , killing civilians			1
keeping a close eye : a @entity51 reconnaissance aircraft touches down after a flight to monitor the failed launch controversial move : a @entity2 soldier stands in front of the country 's @entity21 rocket liftoff : a @entity90 man watches file video of @entity2 's missile launch in @entity224			1
@entity2 's much - anticipated rocket launch ended quickly in failure early friday , splintering into pieces over the @entity27 ' rather than any conventional provocation , i think @entity2 will watch what @entity51 and @entity90 are doing and prepare for a nuclear test , ' said @entity232 , a professor at @entity234 's @entity233			1
the @entity51 and @entity202 said the rocket , which they claimed was a disguised missile test and the @entity238 said was to put a satellite into orbit , crashed into the sea after travelling a much shorter distance than a previous @entity2 launch			1
its failure immediately raised questions over the impoverished @entity2 's reclusive leadership which maintains one of the world 's largest standing armies but which can not feed its people without outside aid , largely from its solitary powerful backer , @entity179			0
' there is no question that the failed launch turns speculation toward the ramifications for the leadership in @entity30 : a fireworks display gone bad on the biggest day of the year , ' said @entity260 of the @entity261			0
hub : experts on space science and technology and media from different countries visiting the @entity267 and @entity268 in @entity30 , @entity2 yesterday on display : the @entity271 satellite as it was unveiled to foreign journalists by @entity2 officials in a highly unusual move , the @entity2 , which still claims success with a 2009 satellite that others say failed , admitted in a state television broadcast seen by its 23 million people that the latest satellite had not made it into orbit			0
the failure is the first major and very public challenge for the third of the @entity25 dynasty to rule @entity2 just months into the leadership of a man believed to be in his late 20s			1
' it could be indication of subtle change in the @entity2 leadership in how they handle these things , something that may be different from the past , ' said @entity296 - joo of the @entity297 a thinktank affiliated with @entity299			2
' i mean it would have been unthinkable for them to admit this kind of failure in the past , something that could be seen as an international humiliation			0
the decision to have come out with the admission had to come from @entity25			0
' early morning fog : the rocket launch can barely be seen through the morning mists view from the top : a satellite image from april 11 shows the @entity314 embarrassingly , the rocket flew for just a few minutes covering a little over 100km to explode over a sea separating the @entity317 and @entity179 , far less than the last rocket in 2009 that travelled 3,800km , alarming @entity202 which it over-flew			1
the launch is in breach of @entity323 @entity322 sanctions and drew condemnation from the @entity51 , @entity325 , @entity90 and @entity202 and threats to tighten already harsh sanctions aimed at stopping @entity30 developing nuclear weapons			1
the concern is that @entity2 is using launches to perfect the kind of technology that would enable it to build a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the @entity51			1
@entity2 has repeatedly defended its right to launch rockets for what it says are peaceful purposes and may have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the failed launch			2
taking action : @entity341 said thursday , ' @entity30 has a clear choice : it can pursue peace and reap the benefits of closer ties with the international community , including the @entity51 ; or it can continue to face pressure and isolation ' @entity179 , the @entity2 's main backer , again appealed for ' calm ' , although its failure to dissuade @entity30 from undertaking the launch despite propping up the ailing and impoverished state , showed the limitations of its diplomacy , analysts said			2
' despite the failure of its attempted missile launch , @entity2 's provocative action threatens regional security , violates international law and contravenes its own recent commitments , ' @entity168 spokesman @entity358 said in a statement			1
foreign ministers of the @entity368 leading industrial nations condemned the launch as in breach of @entity322 resolutions			0
the @entity372 , @entity372 , said the first stage fell into the sea west of @entity90 , and the remainder was deemed to have failed			0
' no debris fell on land , ' @entity372 said			0
' at no time were the missile or the resultant debris a threat			0
defence : @entity384 advanced capability - 3 land - to - air missile units in @entity71 were ready to shoot down the @entity2 launch if it crossed @entity202 airspace at the ready : a @entity90 soldier rides on a self - propelled artillery vehicle during a military exercise against @entity2 's possible attack @entity391 the @entity322 will meet to discuss a possible response to @entity2 's rocket launch today , said council diplomats			1
earlier this week @entity51 ambassador to the @entity323 @entity396 said the 15 - nation council should ' respond credibly ' to a @entity2 missile launch			1
@entity400 diplomats say that the most @entity179 , a permanent veto - wielding council member and @entity2 's protector , would accept is a rebuke of @entity30			0
new sanctions , they said on condition of anonymity , are out of the question			0
past : the launch of the @entity21 rocket , in april 2009 , in @entity2 which @entity30 says put the experimental communications satellite @entity410 into orbit video : simulation of of the @entity2 @entity2 long - range rocket launch failure			1

embarrassing moment for @entity2 as long - range rocket *shatters* minutes after launch
leader @entity25 defiant as he unveils of statue of his father intended to cap ' triumph ' of rocket launch
cost of the operation was *estimated* at *$* *850million* , enough to *buy* *2.5million* tonnes of corn and *1.4million* tonnes of rice
@entity168 described launch as ' provocative '
fears rogue nation will now push ahead with nuclear tests
the @entity51 and @entity90 believe the launch may be a cover for testing a long - range *ballistic* missile
new video *emerges* believed to show *wreckage* of crashed rocket
