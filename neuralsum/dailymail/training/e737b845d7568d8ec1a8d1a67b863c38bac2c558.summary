@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 are successful footballers because their faces are the optimum shape			2
that ’s according to new research , which compared the facial - width - to - height ratios ( @entity9 ) of high - ranking footballers to their on - pitch record			1
it discovered that players with faces that are wider than they are tall are more likely to score goals , but also commit fouls			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) are successful footballers because their faces are the optimum shape , claims new research			2
experts discovered that players with a high facial - width - to - height ratios ( @entity9 ) are more likely to score goals , but also commit fouls the @entity22 star , nicknamed @entity23 because of the shape of his head , has the features that mark out the best forwards from the rest , claim experts from the @entity30			1
mr @entity0 , who will be awarded with a @entity31 at @entity32 on saturday to mark his 100th appearance for @entity34 , has also received six red cards in his career			0
while @entity37 mr @entity1 has scored 33 goals in his international career , but has also received 50 yellow cards in his career for fouls and other offences			0
dr @entity44 from the university analysed 1,000 players from 32 countries at the 2010 @entity49 @entity48			1
researchers from the @entity30 analysed 1,000 players from 32 countries at the 2010 @entity49 @entity48			1
they measured each of the players ' faces on a @entity9 chart ( pictured )			1
@entity9 is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid-brow and the upper lip footballer @entity60 ( left ) has a low - ratio face , while @entity2 's face scores higher on the @entity9 scale			1
both midfielders and forwards with greater @entity66 were more likely to commit fouls he measured each of their faces on a @entity9 chart			1
both midfielders and forwards with greater @entity66 were more likely to commit fouls			1
forwards with higher @entity74 also were more likely to score or lay on goals , according to the findings published in the journal @entity78 and @entity79			2
a recent report found that men with wider faces earn around £ 1,300 more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus			2
however , researchers from the @entity87 said this comes with a compromise , as wide - faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations			2
a separate study from @entity93 found that women are drawn to men with broader faces for short - term relationships , but they do not tend to see them as husband material			2
this could be because men with wider faces are perceived to be more dominant and aggressive			2
while this may initially make them appear desirable , they are less appealing traits in a long - term partner			0
‘ previous research into facial structure of athletes has been primarily in the @entity107 and @entity108 , ’ said dr @entity44			0
‘ no - one had really looked at how facial - width - to - height ratio is associated with athletic performance by comparing people from across the world			1
’ @entity9 is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid-brow and the upper lip			1
past studies have shown a high @entity9 is associated with more aggressive behaviour			1
for example , high @entity9 is associated with greater antisocial and unethical behaviour , but also greater success among @entity125 and achievement drive among @entity107 presidents			1

the @entity138 - based researchers for the latest study chose to look at the @entity48 because of the quality and quantity of the data available			2
the theory also applies to other sports , such as rugby and cycling			0
examples include rugby player @entity148 ( left ) and @entity150 medal winner @entity149 ( right )			0
scientists have several ideas about how @entity9 may be associated with aggression			0
one possibility is it is related to testosterone exposure earlier in life dr @entity44 said : ‘ there are a lot of athletic data out there			0
‘ we were exploring contexts to look at aggressive behaviour and found the @entity48 , which quantifies goals , fouls and assists , provides a multinational way of addressing whether facial structure produces this aggressive behaviour and performance			1

testosterone during puberty can affect a variety of physical traits , including bone density , muscle growth and cranial shape , added dr @entity44 .			0

they measured each of the faces on a facial - width - to - height ratio ( @entity9 )
@entity9 is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid-brow and the upper lip
players with a high @entity9 were more likely to score , but also commit fouls
past studies have shown @entity9 is associated with aggressive behaviour
it is thought that the wider shape indicates higher levels of testosterone
