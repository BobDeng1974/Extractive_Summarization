this week sees the final act in the long - running @entity2 trial , with the athlete set to discover his fate - whether a lengthy prison sentence or parole			1
but an explosive new book written by a journalist who has covered the trial from start to finish and was the first on the scene following miss @entity15 's death has raised new questions about the trial			1
in behind the door , @entity18 argues that the prosecution ignored crucial evidence about miss @entity15 's final moments			1
' with the help of private forensic investigators , we 've established @entity15 probably flushed the toilet moments before her boyfriend , @entity2 , shot her , ' he explains			2
' but neither the state nor the defence presented this flushing – an event in the timeline – as evidence			2
why ? ' the crux of the defence case focused on the idea that a terrified @entity2 , fearing an intruder , shot @entity15 after hearing noises from the bathroom			1
deciding his fate : @entity2 arriving at the courthouse in @entity57 this morning ahead of sentencing conviction : @entity2 could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison following his culpable homicide conviction @entity18 , who hired private investigator @entity61 to look into the question of whether or not the toilet was flushed before @entity64 was shot , says that the evidence suggests that it was			1
' defence expert @entity66 also believed that @entity15 flushed the toilet , and that this further proved @entity2 ' version of events , ' explains @entity18			1
' as he said to me , " this was the third startle [ fright for @entity2 ]			2
it destroys the state ’s case totally			0
with the third startle , his worst fears are confirmed			0
' however @entity18 believes that , rather than proving his innocence , miss @entity15 flushing the toilet moments before being shot by @entity2 actually raises questions about his story			1
@entity2 testified that after hearing the noise in the bathroom , he fetched his firearm and proceeded down the cupboard - lined passage , ' he explains			2
claims : journalist @entity18 ( right ) says evidence was overlooked during the trial of @entity2 ( left ) justice : june and @entity92 , have frequently spoken of their desire to get justice for their daughter in his evidence , @entity2 said : ' i started screaming and shouting for the burglar or the intruders to get out of my house			1
i shouted for @entity15 to get down on the floor			0
' i shouted for her to phone the police			0
i screamed at the people , the persons ( sic ) to get out			0
' according to the athlete , the sound of the toilet door slamming shut was enough to convince him that intruders were indeed in the house			0
' i was not sure if someone was going to come out of the toilet to attack me , ' he said , while giving evidence during the trial			0
' i was not sure if someone was going to come up the ladder and point a firearm in the house and start shooting , so i just stayed where i was and kept on screaming			0
' questions : the issue of whether or not miss @entity15 flushed the toilet was ignored by the prosecution final act : @entity128 could take several days and follows a trial that lasted for more than three months ' it was at this point @entity2 said he heard a noise from inside the cubicle , ' says @entity18			1
' he later said he believed was the magazine rack moving , which prompted him to open fire four times			0
' but it ’s at this point forensic experts believe @entity15 flushed the toilet			0
would she have done so if her boyfriend was just a few arms ' lengths away screaming frantically at an intruder to get out of the house and for her to call the police ? ' although @entity2 and his attorney @entity146 did not respond to @entity18 's inquiries , he says prosecution sources admit to leaving the evidence - which could have reinforced the state case against @entity2 - out			1
' while the national prosecuting authority did not respond to questions , a source in the state ’s team said prosecutor @entity156 did not introduce this evidence because there were simply too many possibilities to consider , ' explains @entity18			2
while @entity2 waits to discover his fate , it seems that questions remain .			0
