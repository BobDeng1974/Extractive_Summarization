travelers will now be allowed to bring golf clubs , ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since aviation officials have announced significant security changes			1
a number of previously - banned items will be allowed for the first time since the september 11 terrorism attacks , sparking outrage from flight attendants who said the decision would endanger passengers and crew			1
the @entity16 said effective april 25 , it would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in length and less than 1/2 inch wide			1
items that had been prohibited like razors , box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board			2
the restrictions about liquids are still in place as well , meaning that anything under 3 - ounces must be declared at the security checkpoint			2
@entity16 spokesman @entity59 said the decision was made to bring @entity62 regulations more in line with @entity65 standards and would also help provide a better experience for travelers			1
specific : the @entity16 says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures exemptions : only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all the @entity77 ' categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of any kind in the cabin , ' and they do n't understand why ' such a momentous decision ' was made without any consultation			1
as for some of the larger items that they will now allow , like the sports equipment , increases ' the potential for passengers getting hit with these items during boarding and deplaning			2
it 's a recipe for disaster , ' said the @entity94 representative			0
' this is part of an overall risk - based security approach , which allows transportation security officers to better focus their efforts on finding higher - threat items such as explosives , ' he said			0
the @entity101 , which represents nearly 90,000 flight attendants from carriers across the country , called the decision a ' poor and shortsighted decision ' by the @entity16			1
loosening the reins : @entity16 officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on april 25 no longer a threat ? billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now ' as the last line of defense in the cabin and key aviation partners , we believe that these proposed changes will further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers we work so hard to keep safe and secure , ' the coalition said in a statement			0
@entity59 said the @entity16 has implemented a number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors , allowing some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes			0
he said those measures would help ensure safety of the passengers and crew			0
after the september 11 , 2001 hijacking attacks , the @entity62 government imposed a strict set of guidelines for what could be carried on board an aircraft - some of which differed from what other countries allowed passengers to carry on airplanes			0

the @entity77 *blasted* ' poor and shortsighted decision '
