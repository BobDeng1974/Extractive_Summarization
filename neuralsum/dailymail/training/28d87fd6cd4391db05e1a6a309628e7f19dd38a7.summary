@entity3 took a class last year from communications professor @entity12 , but the experience did n't go well , the @entity10 reported on thursday			1
@entity3 posted comments on professor - rating sites accusing the teacher of criticizing his academic abilities , grading him unfairly and causing him to fail out of school			1
he said he spoke with her in april about his concerns , two months before he was told he had failed her class			0
@entity12 contends the comments amount to defamation , while @entity3 says his goal was simply to inform the public about how the professor treated him			1
@entity28 , the attorney representing @entity12 , said the comments could be especially damaging to someone in a small professional community			2
he said he and @entity12 agree that students should be allowed to express their opinions , ' but when you go so far beyond that , into a concerted effort to attack somebody 's reputation because things did n't go your way , that 's much different			2
' @entity28 and @entity12 asked @entity3 to take down his online comments and videos			1
they filed the lawsuit after he refused			2
@entity3 said it 's important for the videos and comments to stay online so the public can remain informed			1
he has dedicated several blogs to his arguments with the professor he claims treated him unfairly			0
