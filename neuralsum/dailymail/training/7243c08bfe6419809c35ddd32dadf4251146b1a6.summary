by @entity0 published : 20:37 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 20:46 est , 6 december 2013 chancellor @entity1 , pictured yesterday visiting a @entity3 factory in @entity4 , @entity5 , has been accused of using questionable statistics to claim living standards are rising @entity1 was accused yesterday of using questionable statistics to claim family living standards are rising			1
the @entity10 said voters would be ‘ considerably ’ worse off at the time of the 2015 election , compared with how they fared in 2010 when the coalition came to power			1
a childless couple on the median income will have seen their income drop 6.9 per cent from £ 481 a week in 2010 to £ 450 a week in 2015			1
the @entity10 predicted that the chancellor will have to slash welfare spending by another £ 12billion after the next election if he wants to keep the pace of the government ’s deficit reduction programme on course			1
failure to fill that black hole will mean that @entity29 departments have to slash spending by 3.7 per cent a year up to march 2019 , far deeper savings than the 2.3 per cent a year mr @entity1 has cut by so far			0
in a further blow to the chancellor , the @entity10 said statistics he cited in his @entity35 on thursday to suggest that the disposable income of families are actually rising are ‘ not something with which to measure living standards ’			1
mr @entity1 told @entity41 that official figures for disposable income – the sum families have left after paying essential bills – will rise by 0.5 per cent this year and 1.1 per cent next year			1
‘ yes , real household disposable income is rising , ’ he said			1
but the @entity10 pointed out the statistic mr @entity1 used includes not just household incomes but also the incomes of charities and universities			2
the think tank said there was ‘ something a little bit strange ’ about mr @entity1 ’s choice of statistic			1
@entity10 director @entity56 said : ‘ it tells us something about household incomes but it should certainly not be used in isolation to measure how they are changing			1
’ the @entity10 gave its analysis as a poll showed that more than half of those who saw the @entity35 think it was bad for them			1
some 60 per cent thought it was good for ‘ rich people ’ and just 15 per cent said it was good ‘ for people like me ’			2
some 40 per cent said they support mr balls ’ view that the chancellor is ‘ in denial ’ about the cost of living , while only 24 per backed mr @entity1			1
the highly respected think tank then backed shadow chancellor @entity74 ’ claims that families are worse off			1
mr @entity74 has claimed the average worker has lost £ 1,600 a year in earnings after inflation since the coalition came to power			0
unpopular : a poll found that only 15 % believe the chancellor 's autumn financial statement was good ' for people like me ' whereas 60 % thought it was good for ' rich people ' the @entity10 said @entity92 ’ measure of living standards is also imperfect since most families judge living standards on what they have left after tax and benefits , rather than simply on their gross incomes used by the shadow chancellor			1
but mr @entity56 said @entity102 ’s figures were ‘ pretty consistent ’ with the evidence from survey data on what had happened to household incomes			1
‘ we do know from household surveys that income fell sharply in 2010 and 2011			1
it is almost certainly significantly lower now than it was in 2010			0
and while it should start to grow it will surely still be below its 2010 level by the time we get to the election in 2015			2
’ director of @entity117 , @entity56 , says voters will actually be ' considerably ' worse off at the 2015 election compared to 2010 when the coalition came to power that is helpful for @entity102 since @entity123 and mr @entity74 are determined to fight the next election by asking voters whether they are better off than they were in 2015			1
the @entity10 warned that deep cuts in public spending are still going to be necessary after the next election , pointing out that just 46 per cent of the cuts mr @entity1 has outlined have taken effect so far			2
by the end of 2013 - 14 , @entity29 departmental spending will have fallen by just over 8 per cent since the government ’s austerity programme began and without further tax rises or welfare cuts that looks set to rise to 20 per cent by 2018 - 19			0
a @entity137 spokesman said the chancellor would not dispute that the statistics he used were imperfect			2
he said : ‘ as the chancellor said at the @entity35 , the effects of the financial crash on family budgets and the cost of living are still being felt			2
‘ so , where possible , we have found the money to help hard working families by freezing fuel duty , freezing council tax and taking 2.7million people out of tax by increasing the tax - free personal allowance			0
’ @entity102 frontbenchers yesterday accused @entity74 of having ‘ no plan ’ to deal with rising economic growth and said he should be replaced with former chancellor @entity156			2
senior sources say the shadow chancellor repeatedly refused demands by members of the shadow cabinet to spell out an economic strategy in the event of a bounce back			0
mr @entity74 was licking his wounds yesterday after his response to the @entity35 was widely panned			0
in his speech mr @entity74 went through what one mp called his ‘ greatest hits ’ of the last three years , denouncing flatlining growth and mr @entity1 ’s ‘ millionaire ’s tax cut ’ – but appeared to have little to say about the economy now it is turning around			2
@entity178 prices rose by nearly £ 14,000 during the last 12 months – and are going up at the fastest pace in more than six years , figures have shown			2
mortgage lender @entity180 said the value of a typical home hit £ 174,910 in november , up £ 13,577 on the same month last year and nearly £ 2,000 higher than it was back in october			0
average prices in the three months to november were 7.7 per cent higher than they were a year earlier , the fastest pace of growth since october 2007			0
figures published alongside the @entity35 on thursday show just how lucrative the recovery in the housing market will be for the chancellor			0
the @entity190 has predicted that property - related taxes – including stamp duty , inheritance tax and capital gains tax – will total around £ 155billion between now and 2018 - 19			0
that works out as around £ 71billion more than if the housing market remained flat over the six - year period			0
@entity198 , a former @entity199 economist who now works at @entity200 , said that the revival ‘ is key to the recovery story ’			0
he went on to say : ‘ the booming housing market is a big bonus for @entity1			0
it will generate higher tax receipts from the likes of stamp duty			0
‘ as well as that , the improving housing market is partly behind the rise in confidence in the @entity212 which is boosting spending in shops and vat receipts			0
’ but he warned that there was still a risk the housing market could end up ‘ getting out of control ’ and driving house prices ‘ up to their bubble peak ’ , adding : ‘ that is bad news for the medium term			0

the chancellor told *mps* that official figures for disposable income will rise
but the @entity10 says his choice of statistics are ‘ not something with which to measure living standards ’
the @entity10 says voters will be ' considerably ' worse off at the 2015 election
