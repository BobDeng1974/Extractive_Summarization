@entity0 insists his @entity2 side are not over-reliant on @entity4 's goals			1
@entity4 has supplied over a third of @entity2 's @entity7 goals , as well eight of the last 13 , and captain @entity9 said after last weekend 's 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity11 that they must find a way to lift the scoring burden on the @entity14			1
the 26 - year - old 's importance to @entity2 could be underlined next month when he is away at the @entity16 , but @entity17 refutes the suggestion they are a one - man team			1
' we 're very much a collective here and it 's not just about @entity4 scoring goals , ' @entity0 said at his press conference ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity27			1
@entity4 celebrates scoring against @entity11 in last weekend 's @entity7 clash at the @entity29 the goal was @entity4 's eighth in his last 10 @entity7 appearances ' the way we 've produced the chances for @entity4 to contribute shows that			1
' yes , that 's not to say there 's six or seven players producing goals freely but look at the league and there 's no massive amount of variation apart from the top teams			2
' we create chances for each other and we do n't care who scores as long as the team wins and we are creating those chances and someone 's there to put in the back of the net			0
' @entity17 must cover the absence of @entity4 and midfielder @entity56 who is set to skipper @entity57 at the @entity58 in @entity59 next month following the @entity61 's day trip to @entity62			1
the pair will not return to @entity2 until the start of february			0
@entity56 has been an ever - present in the league this season but @entity0 says he will only add players to his squad during the january transfer window if they are the right fit for the club			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 insists his side are not over-reliant on the @entity14 striker @entity4 has scored more @entity7 goals in 2014 than any other player ' we 've got a very good squad and i 'm not going to be making wholesale changes at all , ' @entity0 said			1
' there are certain positions we will look to strengthen and if we can get the right player to fit into the squad that 's the only time i 'll do business			2
' other than that we 'll go with what we 've got			0
i 've got full confidence in the squad right now and it 's just adding quality to accompany what we 've got			0
' when @entity4 and @entity56 are out for that period it 's for someone to step up to that level			2
' ninth - placed @entity2 head to @entity27 on the back of two straight league defeats and the omens ahead of their trip to the @entity100 are not good			1
they have failed to score on their three previous visits to the @entity104 and a 1 - 0 defeat there in april ranks among one of their poorest performances under @entity17			0
@entity56 is set to represent @entity57 at next month 's @entity110 @entity17 looks on as @entity111 goes down under the challenge of @entity113 but @entity27 have won only once at home all season and have dropped into the bottom two after going nine games without a win			2
' every team in this league is a different challenge , the way they set up and the different personnel and styles they have , ' @entity0 said			0
' it 's getting your team to concentrate on themselves but adjust enough to know where the threats are from the other team			0
' i would imagine they 're looking at this game to turn around their form			0
' they 've got a very experienced manager who will be looking at how to get them back to winning ways and we expect a very difficult game			0
' @entity27 will be different to what we 've played before , so the challenge for us is to perform well enough to take the points			0

@entity4 has scored eight of @entity2 's last 13 league goals
the @entity14 will be away at the @entity16 in january
