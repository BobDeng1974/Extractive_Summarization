@entity0 has challenged his squad to put any dreams of a late charge for the @entity4 to bed and focus instead on the cold reality of winning at @entity7 on saturday			1
@entity8 head to @entity10 in search of what would be an eighth straight league victory , following on from last weekend 's 4 - 1 triumph over @entity15			1
despite their superb run , which has seen confidence grow after some 15 wins in the last 17 through all competitions , the title remains @entity22 's to lose , as the leaders currently hold a seven - point advantage and also a match in hand			1
@entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 appear in good spirits during training @entity33 shares a joke with @entity27 at @entity8 's training hq while @entity36 has his shorts rolled up @entity38 is set to make his 100th @entity4 appearance while @entity40 is back from injury while some @entity43 fans may have allowed themselves a little bit of fantasy football results over the run - in , which will see @entity22 come to the @entity47 on april 26 and also play both @entity48 and @entity15 , @entity0 remains very much focused on the job in hand			1
' i have enough experience to know that i have to live with reality and reality is points and the next game , ' he said			0
' the dreams are for everybody - we all have dreams at night , but when i wake up in the morning i have to come here and make sure we give everything to win the next game			2
' @entity0 continued : ' @entity22 have a difficult schedule , we have a difficult schedule , but what we can only do is master our own schedule			1
' what we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season , give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the @entity72			0
' so we are at an important moment of the @entity4 season and it is a period where you show your quality by focusing on the next game and maintain the quality			0
' of course we want to continue to progress and improve - we can learn from victory as well and everything was not perfect in our last game			0
' @entity82 , @entity33 and @entity36 are pictured at @entity8 's @entity84 base on friday @entity85 is put through his paces on friday as he bids to return to full fitness @entity88 has n't played since november but is in line to feature at @entity7 on saturday evening @entity8 's injury problems look to have finally eased , with midfielders @entity91 , @entity88 and @entity40 all having stepped up their rehabilitation from injury , along with full - back @entity95			1
@entity98 international @entity97 , though , continues to be hampered by an inflamed groin , while centre - half @entity85 will face a fitness test on his thigh problem ahead of saturday 's match			2
@entity7 continue to scrap at the other end of the table , currently second bottom , but only two points from safety			2
with @entity109 having gone down 1 - 0 at @entity10 last month and @entity110 then held to a goalless draw , @entity0 is not taking the trip to @entity113 lightly			1
he said : ' you should n't look at the table because they started slowly , but recently they have played very well against all the big teams in the league and are quite efficient at home			0
' you have to be at their level of physical performance , because they will be there			0
' on the rest , you want to produce the quality of performance that is expected from us on the technical side , but you have first to fight with them physically , that 's for sure			0
' we have to make sure we produce the expected performance on the commitment , on the focus and on the quality of our game			0
