he appealed ' to all those voters , they may be @entity2 voters , they may be @entity43 voters , but voters who simply do n't want to have their vote taken for granted by @entity4 '			1
he added : ' if you want to stop @entity4 pocketing your vote and dancing off to strut his stuff on the @entity11 stage , the only way to stop him is to vote for @entity39 as the next mp for @entity17			2
' sir @entity34 had held @entity17 for the @entity7 since 1983 , but the scale of the challenge facing mr @entity0 's party was illustrated by a lord @entity57 poll in january which put the @entity32 on 43 per cent with the @entity7 on 26 per cent			1
mr @entity0 warned that the @entity32 wanted to reopen ' old wounds ' from the divisive independence referendum campaign that had strained families , friendships and communities			2
the @entity7 leader said : ' that referendum was fought over months and years , it was fought with passion and vigour on all sides			1
' but , let 's be honest , it placed some strain on communities			0
friendships were placed under strain as people differed on that fundamental thing			0
even relationships within families were put under strain			0
' the people of @entity13 do n't want to turn the clock back and reopen those wounds about that debate , they want to move forward			2
' mr @entity0 told reporters that the @entity32 offered the ' politics of division '			2
he said : ' when i speak to people in @entity17 and elsewhere , they say ' let 's move on ' - they do n't want the politics of division from the nationalists , they want the politics of hope , of unity , of continuity			0
' mr @entity0 warned that the @entity32 wanted to reopen ' old wounds ' from the divisive independence referendum campaign that had strained families , friendships and communities mr @entity0 said it was ' possible ' that the @entity7 could come out of the election with more seats than @entity2 in @entity13 mr @entity0 dismissed as ' ludicrous ' suggestions that it was hypocritical to urge supporters of other parties to back the @entity7 to stop the @entity32 if he was not prepared to tell his voters to put their cross in @entity2 's box in seats where @entity114 's party is battling the nationalists			1
speaking to reporters on his campaign bus , he said : ' it 's not up to me to appeal to @entity7 voters to vote for other parties , it 's for other parties to make their case			2
' he added : ' of course i am not going to start telling @entity7 voters to vote for other parties			2
if other parties want to make a pitch to them in other parts of the country , it 's a free country , they can do it			0
' it 's called a campaign			0
it 's what happens in every single campaign			0
no party can win seats without reaching beyond their core vote			0
' mr @entity0 said he would ' let the @entity32 and @entity2 fight it out and talk to those voters '			1
' it 's not for me to start telling @entity7 voters to do anything other than vote @entity143 a ludicrous idea			2
' mr @entity0 dismissed as ' ludicrous ' suggestions that it was hypocritical to urge supporters of other parties to back the @entity7 to stop the @entity32 if he was not prepared to tell his voters to put their cross in @entity2 's box in seats where @entity114 's party is battling the nationalists mr @entity0 said it was ' possible ' that the @entity7 could come out of the election with more seats than @entity2 in @entity13 because of the damage the @entity32 surge could inflict on mr @entity114 's party			1
he said : ' i suppose that 's theoretically possible			0
i try to avoid making predictions , but i 'm quite seduced by that prospect			0
' mr @entity0 blamed @entity2 's failings for the current political landscape in @entity13			1
' i 've never in my adult political life seen a party so complacent about taking thousands of voters for granted , to the extent that when the @entity32 challenged them , they had no organisation , ' he said			0
' particularly at campaign times , politics is the marriage of lofty ideals with gritty organisation , and you ca n't deliver your messages and ideas and you certainly defend them when they are being challenged , unless you have an organisation			0
' and the @entity2 , astonishingly , just basically let that organisation disappear , just wither on the vine ... we 'll see where it ends up but i suspect we 'll weather the challenge from the @entity32 a lot better than @entity2 does			0
' mr @entity0 also took his campaign against the @entity32 to @entity185 and @entity186 , where sir @entity187 is hoping to hold on to his seat .			0
