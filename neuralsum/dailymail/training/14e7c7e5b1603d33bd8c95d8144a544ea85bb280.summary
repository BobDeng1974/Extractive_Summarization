by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 06:31 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 09:13 est , 3 may 2013 an explosion has rocked @entity4 just days after three soldiers were killed in armoured truck by @entity8 bomb			1
the blast occurred last night at an ammunition depot within the base and five people later went to hospital to receive treatment			1
flight stopped amid fears the @entity18 base was under attack , although they have since resumed - the explosion is not thought to be a terror attack			1
explosion : @entity23 military vehicles sit in a compound in @entity4 , @entity18			1
an explosion occurred within the grounds at an ammunition depot last night the heavily fortified @entity4 was damaged in february after insurgents launched a rocket attack on the main coalition military base in @entity18 's @entity31			1
last september , two @entity32 were killed and six @entity34 jets destroyed when militants breached the perimeter fence and attacked @entity37 , the @entity39 headquarters next to @entity4			2
the incident comes just days after the @entity8 launched its ‘ spring offensive ’ against coalition forces			1
the @entity8 said they would infiltrate ‘ enemy ranks ’ to conduct ‘ insider attacks ’ and target military and diplomatic sites with suicide bombers			2
meanwhile @entity23 special forces in @entity18 have uncovered a cache of homemade bombs primed for use in a raid just five miles from the @entity54 blast which killed three soldiers			1
members of the elite unit - codenamed @entity57 42 - helped seize 27 pressure - plate improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) at a secretive @entity8 weapons factory			2
killed : corporal @entity67 , left , and @entity68 , both served in the @entity69 , @entity63 , the @entity64 ( 2 @entity65 ) and died this week after a @entity8 blast hit their armoured vehicle they also discovered rounds for @entity74 semi-automatic rifles and other military equipment stockpiled by insurgents near the village of @entity78 , @entity31			1
the mission , led by the @entity80 , took place just hours after corporal @entity82 , 30 , fusilier @entity83 , 21 , and private @entity84 , 25 , died and six others were injured when their armoured vehicle was blown up by a massive roadside bomb			1
the ied , assessed to be easily in excess of 400lbs , was one of the biggest ever detonated during the war			0
targeted : three @entity23 soldiers were killed in @entity18 when their @entity54 armoured vehicle which was introduced to protect troops was devastated by a huge roadside bomb ( file picture ) killed : the soldiers ( not pictured ) were flown to the military hospital at @entity4 but could not be saved the blast , during a patrol along @entity100 in @entity103 - e @entity102 district , was so powerful it hurled the 23 - ton personnel carrier into the air and rolled it onto its roof			1
the victims , deployed with the @entity69 , the 2nd @entity108 , were the first to be killed in a @entity54 , which offers world - beating protection from explosions			0
crucially , the blast did not penetrate the £ 1million vehicle 's armour			0
major @entity115 , a spokesman for the @entity69 , said : ' the loss of three of our brothers in arms in any circumstances would be tragic but to lose three in one go is a hammer blow			0
' the @entity125 is now urgently investigating whether the seized cache could be linked to tuesday 's attack			0
the discovery , along with two similar - sized finds in the warzone , came as the @entity8 launched a so - called ' @entity131 ' against @entity133 troops			1
military scientists are examining the remains of the @entity54 to discover if any additional protection can feasibly be added			0
scene : the soldiers were on a routine patrol in the @entity103 - e @entity141 district of @entity31 in due course it will be flown back to the @entity23 where extensive tests will be carried out to determine any vulnerabilities			2
early indications suggest the roadside bomb was covertly dug under @entity100 , a layer of @entity149 which is a key road through central @entity31 , and triggered by remote control			1
meanwhile , experts from the @entity152 and the @entity153 are examining debris for any ' forensic fingerprint ' that might give commanders a clue to identify those behind the bomb			0
investigators are concerned that a new form of threat , such as a sophisticated remote - controlled command wire , may have been used			0
this may point to the involvement of @entity165 having an input in the attack			0
@entity165 is known to have developed a new ' bomb initiator ' which was allegedly used by @entity169 in bus attacks against @entity172 civilians last year			0
a @entity23 bomb disposal operator who recently returned from @entity31 said : ' we need to establish quickly how they set this one off			2
it looks like a deep bundle of explosives in the road and i suspect they had help from an outside agency , @entity165 , in pulling this off			0
' the bomb expert pointed out that the @entity23 task force , @entity186 , had only recently started its six - month deployment in @entity31			2
he said : ' the insurgents would have known this and taken advantage and there is the possibility that the route was not as well patrolled as it had been			0
' but the detonation device is the critical factor , we need to identify it and intercept any future use			0
