after such success in the holding role last season , @entity0 was moved to the top of the midfield diamond			1
he is a superb player but he could not get into the game			2
it is a position that requires constant thrust and bursts of pace but @entity0 is 34 years old now , so that is not his strength			1
i can see him playing at the highest level for a couple more years in a deep role but not there			2
but @entity18 obviously felt he needed his best player in a more advanced position			2
@entity0 has plenty left in him for @entity22 , but not in that attacking midfield position @entity0 is better suited in a deep role in the midfield for @entity22 ; bursting through is n't his strength @entity22 were relying on @entity26 to break from deep and get beyond @entity27 and @entity0 , as he did for his goal			1
@entity29 was at fault for the goal that saw the @entity33 hosts take the lead on wednesday night @entity35 must be better prepared people were quick to defend @entity29 for the opening goal , saying the ball bounced awkwardly in front of him , but he was at fault			1
keepers warm up for such a long time these days so there must be something wrong with his preparation			0
it should n’t have been a surprise to him that the surface was uneven			0
he will know it was an awful mistake			0
he seems to have a big problem with long - range efforts - with another one hitting him in the face			2
@entity29 is having a tough time and he needs to do better			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
did @entity18 drop @entity57 or others or were they just rested ? we will find out on saturday against @entity60			1
@entity18 has struggled with managing his squad now @entity22 have games every few days			1
is this another attempt to do that or is he is just fed up with too many poor performances ? ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity66 is @entity22 ’s brightestshining light			1
there are not many young @entity70 players who can cross with both feet			0
he drifts past people effortlessly			0
his assist took intelligence : where to run to find space to cross , when to cross and where to cross			0
and all this happens at pace			0
his heat map shows how hard he tried to influence the game			0
@entity66 's heat map shows how hard he tried to influence the game @entity57 ( second left ) on the bench in @entity86 on wednesday night during the clash @entity66 is @entity22 ’s biggest shining light , setting up @entity26 for his goal with fantastic vision			1

@entity22 drew 2 - 2 with @entity86 in @entity93 tie
@entity0 has years left at @entity22 , but not in an attacking role
@entity29 was at fault for @entity86 ' opening goal
were @entity100 rested or dropped by @entity18 ?
midfielder @entity66 is @entity22 ’s biggest shining light
