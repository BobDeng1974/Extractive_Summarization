by @entity0 billionaire @entity1 has challenged @entity2 to beef up his workout with some cardio after surreptitiously - filmed footage of the president working out was released earlier this week			1
the wealthy 86 - year - old , whose net worth @entity9 estimates to be around $ 1.2billion , has previously donated extensively to conservative causes but has taken an activist role in alternative energy sources in recent years			2
' i challenge @entity14 to a 1 hr workout			0
will work out energy plan for @entity20 # nosweat , ' he wrote in a tweet with a video attached that shows him running up a hill in @entity25			2
workout face off : @entity1 posted a video of himself running up a hill in @entity25 ( left ) as part of a jab at president @entity2 for not including cardio as part of his workout ( right ) taking it to the tweets : @entity1 is an advocate for renewable energy and he played that into his playful post @entity1 was a vocal critic of @entity40 when he was the @entity41 nominee for president in 2008 but the two have since joined forces in 2010 on an energy plan backed by then - senator @entity40 and other @entity41			1
the bill has since been dubbed the @entity47 and calls for greater use of natural gas and wind power in order to relieve some of @entity20 's dependence on foreign oil			0
poking fun : the 86 - year - old billionaire is known to enjoy his @entity57 feed this is not the first time that the octogenarian has used @entity57 to call out a formidable foe			1
in 2012 , @entity1 caused a stir when he started a playful war of words with @entity66 rapper @entity65			2
@entity65 posted a tweet in may 2012 writing : ' the first million is the hardest ' and @entity1 came up with a pithy response			0
' the first billion is a helluva lot harder , ' he wrote back			0
@entity65 accepted the proverbial hat that @entity1 had handed back to him , writing ' @ boonepickens just stunted on me heavy '			0
no word if president @entity2 is going to be as witty in his response to @entity1 .			1

@entity1 , 86 , poked fun at the video released of president @entity2 working out by *joking* he should *incorporate* cardio
@entity1 , a conservative *financier* , has been working on renewable energy initiatives and he played that into the @entity57 joke
is *n't* the first time @entity86 took to @entity57 to show his *lighter* side
