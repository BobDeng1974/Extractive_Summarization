even her greatest fans would acknowledge that @entity2 is less than svelte – and the comedienne has long ridiculed her own physique and appetite for food in such books as her autobiography @entity9 and the tv series @entity11			0
so the notion of the star who once dubbed herself ‘ the @entity14 ’ managing to squeeze her way through a dog flap sounds a rather fanciful tale			1
would i lie to you ? @entity2 appeared on the popular @entity21 comedy show on friday night yet this is exactly how she once broke into the home of an ex-boyfriend to steal all his underpants as revenge for him cheating on her			1
recalling that she was ‘ about 18 - ish ’ at the time , @entity28 said : ‘ i was going out with this bloke who was a millionaire			1
‘ we went to a party next door to his house			2
he ended up snogging someone else at this party – a woman with blonde hair , i ca n’t remember her name – so i was quite cross , ’ adding that she ‘ just wanted to do something ’ to make her jealousy clear			1
she joked that the dog flap was designed for a @entity45 then added : ‘ he had a fat @entity47			1
i was thin at the time			2
i did n’t walk straight through – i wiggled through it			0
’ the 57 - year - old said she searched the man ’s bedroom for both washed and unwashed pants , as she wanted to do something ‘ he would think was a bit weird ’ , while leaving him guessing over who was to blame			1
brand ’s confession came during her appearance on the @entity21 comedy quiz @entity58 , a panel game in which contestants have to decide whether the stories told by other celebrities are true or false			1
flap : at the time of the event @entity2 's boyfriend ' had a fat @entity47 dog			2
i was thin at the time ' she had to explain her link to a mystery guest called @entity75			2
‘ he once helped me break into an ex-boyfriend ’s house through the dog flap so i could steal all his pants , ’ she declared , leaving it up to the opposing team to decide whether or not to believe her			1
‘ @entity75 ’s part in it was that he helped push me through the garden side and he kept watch in case the neighbours noticed			0
‘ we went through the bedroom , got all his pants out of the drawer and all his pants out of the washing basket [ and ] threw them out into the garden			0
we went and chucked them in a bin and then went to the pub or something			0
a bit of me wanted to do something that he would think was a bit weird and possibly not know it was me ... ’ she did not name the boyfriend and said she never saw him again			1
at the time , in the 1970s , she was living in @entity105 , @entity106 , working in the civil service and studying part - time at nearby @entity109			0
in interviews over the years she has described her teenage life as ‘ the nightmare adolescent business ’ and admitted she was ‘ invited ’ to leave home at 16 by her parents			2
@entity115 ( right , with fellow @entity117 regulars @entity119 , left , and @entity120 , centre ) said : ‘ i ’ve known @entity2 for some years and i can confirm she is bitter and twisted ’ this followed an ultimatum from her civil engineer father @entity124 to stop seeing her first serious boyfriend			1
in a newspaper interview 18 years ago , @entity28 ’s mother @entity128 recalled the moment			1
she said : ‘ he was full of middle - class airs , with a very cavalier view of the world			0
she could have chosen almost anyone else and i could have coped better			0
he was 18 , she was 16			0
the battleground was what time she could come home in the evening			0
‘ we waited up for her and he came in , too			0
‘ when we said it was too late he was very disdainful			0
it made you feel you were n’t good enough			0
’ it is unclear whether the boyfriend later became the millionaire pants - snatch victim although due to his age it seems unlikely			2
even her greatest fans would acknowledge that comedienne @entity2 is less than svelte the family row soon passed and mrs @entity2 told how she felt ‘ proud and protective ’ of her daughter			1
during friday ’s show , rival panellist @entity115 led the questioning of @entity28 about her millionaire lover			1
he concluded : ‘ so you do n’t know to this day whether he ... well , he knows now			0
’ she replied : ‘ hopefully he ’s dead so he does n’t			2
’ @entity115 retorted : ‘ as long as you ’ve got over it then , @entity2			1
’ he suspected she was telling the truth , insisting : ‘ i ’ve known @entity2 for some years and i can confirm she is bitter and twisted			1
’ however he bowed to the votes of his team - mates who were both convinced she was lying			0
@entity28 , who lives in south @entity168 with her husband and two daughters , was unavailable for comment			2
her manager said : ‘ @entity2 is away for half - term			0
