current @entity1 first - team coach and former @entity3 manager @entity0 looks ahead to the crunch @entity5 match between bitter rivals @entity8 and @entity9			1
third - placed @entity8 go into the game looking for their sixth consecutive win in the league , while the visitors will be hoping to turnaround their poor start to the season with victory at @entity19			1
in last season 's corresponding fixture at the @entity19 , @entity9 cruised to a 3 - 0 victory			1
@entity23 columnist @entity0 expects the match to have a different outcome though this time around			0
@entity9 captain @entity26 scored two penalties in their 3 - 0 win at @entity8 last season @entity9 's missing strikers @entity9 ’s most glaring problem is their lack of goals			1
hardly surprising when you lose both @entity35 and @entity36			0
this time last year @entity9 had already scored 30 @entity5 goals			1
this season they have scored only 19			1
of the 101 goals they scored last season , 53 came from those two and another 12 from @entity26			1
you have to have some sympathy for @entity43			0
he might have expected to lose @entity35 but could never have expected to cope for this part of the season without both of them			0
last season i saw some games where they were scintillating			0
at other times they were average but @entity35 got them the points			0
@entity9 have failed to replace @entity35 's goalscoring talent ( right ) after his summer move to @entity58 after 15 games last season @entity9 had 30 points , eight more than @entity8			1
now @entity8 ( 28 ) are seven clear			2
both sides have made 16 changes to their defences this season			0
@entity8 have used 11 players , @entity9 9			1
@entity9 ’s @entity66 @entity9 just ca n’t replicate the style they had last season			1
it ’s not just that the strikers they signed , @entity72 and @entity73 , have n’t fitted in and scored goals , they do n’t offer the same qualities off the ball as @entity35 and @entity36			2
last season , @entity9 came at teams in a frenzy of attacking football , especially at @entity80 , and would often sweep them away in the first 20 minutes			1
it was this time last year when they started playing like that , with a 5 - 1 win against @entity85 and a 4 - 1 win over @entity87 , both at @entity80 in december 2013 and then , on this weekend last year , a 5 - 0 win at @entity88 which made everyone sit up and take notice			2
this fixture last season at @entity19 was a great example of their best form - a 3 - 0 win after they were 2 - 0 up very early in the second half			1
@entity35 and @entity36 had energy and pace but @entity72 and @entity73 are much more static			0
they do n’t run into the same areas to stretch teams			0
@entity9 are not just missing the goals , the style of play that had been so effective is n’t working at the moment			1
@entity9 have had to adapt to a different style of play upfront with the summer signing of @entity72 @entity9 ’s @entity109 because of their lack of goals , @entity26 has been playing much further up the pitch			1
that means they ’ve lost their best distributor of the ball from deep			0
@entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 have n’t been hitting the same heights this season either			0
they ’re struggling with their distribution - they do n’t have a quick enough picture in their minds of how the game is unfolding			0
previously , they would have @entity26 supporting them and @entity36 and @entity35 as well as @entity129 giving them plenty of options			0
@entity133 ( left ) and @entity117 ( centre left ) have failed to reach last season 's heights @entity137 it 's interesting that @entity9 had conceded 18 goals this time last year - this season it ’s 19 - but neither side can get a settled defence			1
@entity9 have fielded the same back four on only three occasions this season and the last time they named an unchanged side was against @entity148 back in april			2
@entity9 boss @entity43 has fielded the same back four on only three occasions this season incredibly , @entity8 have n’t named an unchanged side since november 2012			1
in defence they have switched between a back three and a back four and have only been able to go with the same personnel and formation on four occasions			0
@entity9 are still finding their way			2
new signing @entity156 is struggling while @entity158 is n’t picked every week			0
@entity8 are decimated by injuries , at various times losing @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			2
@entity164 is one of several @entity8 defenders who will sunday 's match at home to @entity9 due to injury @entity8 ’s vulnerability my specific concern is @entity178 playing at left back or wing back			1
they got away with it at @entity182			0
when @entity184 got on the back post at 52 minutes on monday , he should have made it 2 - 1 and that would have been a decisive moment			0
it was waiting to happen and had been clearly signposted			0
@entity178 finds it very difficult to defend in those situations			0
@entity192 has a problem on sunday : does he stick with a back three , putting @entity194 in there and leaving himself vulnerable on the flanks ? @entity178 will probably be up against @entity197 ! i would prefer a back four with @entity165 at left back but that would mean they have @entity163 and @entity169 at centre half , one of whom has only just come back from injury and the other who will be low on confidence after being taken off early against @entity182			0
@entity178 ( left ) was unconvincing defensively in @entity8 's 2 - 1 @entity5 win at @entity182 lucky managers @entity209 once talked about how @entity210 had said he preferred lucky generals over clever ones			1
i think @entity213 will realise that he ’s been fortunate so far in his @entity5 season to be in third place having played so poorly			2
but having got the team into that position he must now feel confident			0
he knows he has players coming back , he will have a stronger defence in the second half of the season and @entity8 are likely to get better			2
despite a never - ending crippling injury list , @entity8 boss @entity192 has guided his side to third in the table the verdict both sides are playing poorly and both are defensively weak			2
when the tactical systems are n’t working well , it tends to come down to the quality of the individuals , and that ’s why i feel this game has come at the right time for @entity8			2
if @entity8 beat @entity9 on sunday it will be their sixth consecutive win in the @entity5 this season with @entity238 coming into form and @entity240 on the pitch , they have more experienced players of quality than @entity9			1
and they have the momentum of five consecutive wins , however , scratchy they were			0
@entity9 are in a trough , confidence is low			2
at @entity19 on sunday afternoon , it ’s hard to see beyond a @entity8 win			1
@entity238 ( right ) scored both goals in @entity8 's 2 - 1 victory on the south coast on monday night read more from @entity0 on @entity253			1

@entity8 host rivals @entity9 in sunday 's @entity5 clash
@entity8 will be looking for their sixth consecutive league win this season
@entity9 have scored 19 goals this term - 11 fewer than 12 months *ago*
