people in @entity2 must stop flushing their toilets so often , the @entity0 has declared			2
@entity4 wants to impose a new bog standard flush across the continent to reduce water use after splashing out £ 72,000 on a study into toilet habits in 26 countries			1
the bizarre edict on cistern size from @entity13 suggests @entity15 ’s hopes of cutting unnecessary regulations has gone down the pan			2
panned : the @entity18 spent £ 76,000 on a study looking at how much water different countries using flushing the toilets already dubbed the ‘ euroflush ’ , @entity4 wants to standardise toilet flushes across the @entity0			1
it wants toilets to be limited to five litres and urinals one litre			2
a ‘ half - flush ’ will be allowed three litres , according to a draft of the policy			1
cisterns in the @entity2 can contain up to six litres of water , but older toilets could be even bigger			1
the @entity18 launched a detailed study , costing £ 72,000 into the toilet habits of the continent			1
urinals would be banned from using more than one litre of water , under @entity0 plans it found that people in the @entity2 flush the most , using 1,125 million cubic metres of water in home toilets in 2010 , followed by @entity40 ( 1,074 ) and @entity41 ( 1,021 ) , the @entity37 reported			2
across the @entity0 a quarter of all domestic water use was used by toilets , but in @entity2 the figure was higher at 30 per cent – beaten only by 33 per cent in @entity46			2
by comparison people @entity47 flushed the least , at 14 per cent of all household water usage			0
a 122 - page report on toilet flushing was produced by the @entity18 , which concluded : ‘ two key elements appear to affect the water consumption of flushing toilets and urinals : their design and the user behaviour			1
‘ user behaviour is a crucial aspect and must be without any doubts emphasised			0
‘ the user behaviour analysis carried out showed how the average water consumption differs among the @entity0 member states			0
also the consumption between citizens of one country may vary very significantly			0
’ @entity67 , deputy leader of the @entity2 @entity68 , said it was a ' preposterous waster of money '			1
he added : ' they admit in their report that there are significant cultural differences in latrine etiquette			2
' the bottom line is they are talking about red - tape all the time but instead we are spending two and a half years on a 60 - page report to tray and harmonise loo behaviour amongst the peoples of @entity84 ' surely what goes on behind the bathroom door should be left to the people who are behind it			1
it is money down the pan			0
' regulations : the revelation comes after @entity15 struck a deal with @entity18 president @entity95 to cut @entity4 red - tape the report also found that @entity2 has 45.3 million private and public toilets , the fourth highest number in the @entity0			1
@entity41 has the most at 77 million , followed by @entity100 ( 49.2 million ) and @entity40 ( 46.5 million )			0
@entity40 has the most urinals in @entity84 - 8.2 million			0
all this work will be used as part of @entity0 plans to impose an ’ eco-label ’ on goods sold across the continent			0
but this rush to create more regulations appears at odds with mr @entity15 ’s insistence that @entity0 red - tape is ‘ throttling ’ @entity2 business			1
last week he struck a deal with @entity95 , the @entity18 president , that @entity4 move to reduce bureaucratic recommendations			0
an @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ we will propose next week criteria under which member states can award @entity120 status to products , in this case toilets and urinals			0
' eco-label criteria help consumers , businesses , local authorities etc , who want to buy green products , know which product to choose			0

@entity18 spends £ 72,000 on study into toilet habits
@entity2 has fourth highest number of toilets but flushes the most water
cisterns would be limited to 5 litres , or 3 litres for a half - flush
@entity15 *'s* hopes of cutting red - tape have gone down the pan
@entity68 *condemns* ' preposterous waste of money ' on ' latrine etiquette '
