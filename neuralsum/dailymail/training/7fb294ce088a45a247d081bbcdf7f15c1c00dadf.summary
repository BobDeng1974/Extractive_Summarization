we 're all family , ' he says of the phone call , in which the actor broke the news of the end of the three - year union			0

@entity0 says that he now wished his daughter had married a ' nobody ' , someone who was completely out of the limelight			2
so close : @entity1 and her mother @entity36 used to be like ' best friends ' and speak every single day , but it appears that things have changed separated : the @entity71 family say they have n't seen @entity1 or her son @entity20 for over a year ' after what i know now i would rather she did just marry a nobody because you really ca n't get that family time by yourself , ' he says			2
' i just hope @entity20 grows up and he wants to be with his nan and pop.

' it 's very nice where they are but nothing like @entity24 , nothing , and i think hopefully @entity20 might end up here			2

breaking the news : @entity1 's father @entity0 , pictured here with his daughter and @entity31 in august 2012 , says it was the actor who confirmed to him the news of the couple 's separation last year , over the telephone meanwhile , @entity1 's mother @entity36 , who says she used to speak to her daughter every single day , is teary as she explains of how she had to eventually ' let go ' of her daughter			1
' what i have had to do is let go , ' she explains , ' and allow her to be assertive and lead her own life and i guess for any mum that 's a little bit challenging sometimes to do that			0
' @entity36 says she now sends texts to @entity123 to remind her that she 's always there for her , but as she is filmed doing so during the documentary , they are not always immediately reciprocated			0
missing his grandson : @entity0 says he hopes that @entity20 grows up and wants to be with his ' nan and pop ' ' we have been best friends for most of our life			2
we used to talk just about every day			0
' i send her messages , just little texts to say " i love you honey , let your little light shine , my arms are wrapped around you			0
" ' before @entity1 moved to @entity141 at the age of 25 , her parents say they told the then budding supermodel ' the day you think you 're better than anyone else is the day you do n't model under our guidance '			2
@entity36 says these days her daughter 's life is completely different , but it is important as her mother says to stand ' true '			0
sexy selfie : @entity1 posted this racy selfie on thursday during what appeared to be a modelling shot ' @entity1 's life is so different now ( and ) she 's surrounded by yes people all the time			1
it 's so important for me to be real , to be true , to be who she needs me to be , ' she says			0
since parting ways with @entity1 's @entity59 skincare line , @entity36 has created her own called divine by @entity165 , and says that while she realises her daughter 's fame has helped get the ' message out ' , it has perhaps come at a cost to her family			1
' you have to be in the media to be able to get your message out , but then our little @entity174 does n't know what it 's like to walk outside without paparazzi , ' she says			0
going solo : in recent weeks , the supermodel has often been stepping out on her own meanwhile , the former @entity182 's father says that while he 's proud of his daughter for being a strong independent 30 - year - old , he also wishes that she was just a ' normal , everyday girl '			1
' there were so many people who said " oh @entity123 she used to be this nice little girl who we could get to do anything " , whereas now she 's like ' you know what , i 'm not doing that anymore , ' he says			0
