by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:20 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 21:17 est , 15 june 2012 warning : sir @entity2 said teachers are being forced to battle against an anti-learning culture thousands of children from dysfunctional homes should be taken from their families and put in boarding schools , the head of @entity7 claimed yesterday			1
sir @entity2 , chief inspector of schools , said drastic intervention was needed to help youngsters whose futures were being blighted by their parents ’ low expectations and chaotic lifestyles			1
he warned that too many pupils were coming to school from an ‘ anti-learning culture ’ amid a ‘ backdrop of lost standards , values and ambitions ’			1
the problem was being compounded by parents failing to enforce boundaries and absent fathers in particular who , he said , should be condemned by society for their failure to support their children			2
fathers needed to see raising their children as the ‘ right and manly ’ thing to do			2
sir @entity2 , a former head teacher , spoke out as he launched a major review aimed at tackling the achievement gap between rich and poor students			1
in an interview with @entity41 presenter @entity40 , he said the inquiry would consider whether some children should be taken from their parents on educational grounds			2
he said : ‘ there are some dysfunctional families where children … come to school completely unprepared to be able to work			0
tough battle : working class communities lack ambition and aspiration , making the job of schools more difficult , the @entity7 chief inspector warned ( file picture ) ‘ i think the government have said there are 30,000 of these families , and there may be more			1
‘ hopefully one of the things we can look at ( in this review ) is to say some of these children need to be lifted from the home … at a very early stage and put into boarding education where they can be looked after , cared for and loved			1
’ sir @entity2 suggested that ministers were already considering similar plans , adding : ‘ i know the government is interested in this			1
’ he also called on fathers to play a far greater role in the lives of their children following divorce or separation from the mother			0
‘ i would say to absent dads , get involved in your children ’s lives , ’ he said			0
‘ if you do n’t , you should be condemned			0
’ earlier , he warned the @entity86 annual conference in @entity87 that his review – which will report in may next year – will look for ‘ radical solutions ’ to narrow achievement gaps			0
referring to a newspaper article that highlighted the lack of ambition in white , working class areas , he said that historically there used to be a ‘ real respect for education ’ in these communities			1
he said : ‘ too many children and young people come to school against a backdrop of lost standards , values and ambitions			1
’ under @entity107 , ministers had wanted boarding schools to admit pupils in the care of social services			0
it was hoped that 3,000 would eventually be placed			0
but it was revealed in 2008 that only 25 had been – and eight dropped out			0
@entity116 adviser sir @entity115 said left - wing social workers had scuppered the scheme			2
a @entity120 spokesman said : ‘ placement in boarding schools is an option but would be at the discretion of the local authority			0
every case would be assessed on the individual needs of the child			0

teachers are battling against an anti-learning culture , @entity7 chief inspector sir @entity2 warns
working class communities have lost a ' real respect for education '
*teenage* *pregnancies* and *truancy* are still ' too high ' , inspection head warns
