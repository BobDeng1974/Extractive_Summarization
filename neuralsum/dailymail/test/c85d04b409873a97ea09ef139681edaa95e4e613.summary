@entity1 will today promise extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs			1
in a speech on the economy , the prime minister will say the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment			0
the @entity13 have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £ 150,000 to fund additional free childcare places			1
so we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three - and four - year - olds and disadvantaged two - year - olds			2
‘ in the next @entity32 we will double that for three - and four - year - olds			0
that ’ s right – 30 hours of free childcare a week – worth £ 5,000 to working families			1
‘ that means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year – nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs – all by 2017			1
’ mr @entity1 will also argue ‘ that true compassion is n’t giving people a benefits cheque – it ’s giving them a chance ’			1
the @entity13 inherited a ‘ shocking situation ’ where ‘ some of the poorest people faced some of the highest marginal rates of taxation ’ and couples ‘ were spending as much on childcare as one of them took home in earnings ’			2
‘ we , the @entity22 , have been using all the tools at our disposal – the tax and benefit system ; childcare and the minimum wage , to turn that around			1
this goes to the heart of the country we are trying to build : one based on the principle of something for something , not something for nothing – where those who put in , get out , where hard work is rewarded – where we make work pay			1
‘ i ’ve said it before : i ’m not in this job to be some high powered accountant			0
i do n’t just want the lines on the graph to go in the right direction			0
i want lives to go in the right direction			0
i believe passionately in reducing poverty			2
and the best route out of poverty is this : work			2
‘ we ’ve proved that			0
since we came to power – since we ’ve got more people working than in our history – there are 600,000 fewer people and 300,000 fewer children in relative poverty			0
’ the new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage			0
the new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under £ 350 million a year .			1

@entity1 will announce the new £ 350 million childcare places today
he will cut tax relief on pension contributions for those on more than £ 150k
mr @entity1 will tell his audience he wants to ' make hard work pay '
he will say that work rather than benefits is the best way to avoid poverty
