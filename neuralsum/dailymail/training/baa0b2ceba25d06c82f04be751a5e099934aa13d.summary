by @entity0 a study from the @entity2 that polled 127 snapchat users ages 18 and over found that 60 percent of respondents used @entity5 primarily to send ' funny content ' @entity5 may have a reputation as a sexting app for teens , but in reality , you 're far more likely to find cat pictures and selfies , researchers have found			1
a study from the @entity2 polled 127 snapchat users ages 18 and over			0
it found that 60 % of respondents used @entity5 primarily to send ' funny content , ' while the second most popular type of ' snap ' is a selfie			1
fourteen percent of those surveyed said they 'd previously sent sexts over @entity5 , but just 1.6 percent said they do so regularly			1
@entity5 , which allows people to exchange messages that self - destruct seconds after they 're viewed , has attracted an estimated 82 million users , most of whom are between ages 13 and 25			1
the survey also found that many users did not care about relative insecurity of pictures sent using the app. ' we surveyed 127 adult @entity40 , finding that security is not a major concern for the majority of these respondents , ' the researchers wrote			0
' we learn that most do not use @entity5 to sendsensitive content ( although up to 25 % may do so experimentally ) , that taking screenshots is not generally a violation of the sender 's trust but instead common and expected , that most respondents understand that messages can be recovered , and that security and privacy concerns are overshadowed by other influences on how and why respondents choose to use or not use @entity5			1

at the end of 2013 it was estimated that @entity5 had over 26 million users in the @entity70 alone , with many others around the @entity72 in a survey of @entity70 college students in february , 77 % said they used @entity5 on a daily basis.but the company still apparently holds only 5 % of the ' selfie ' market , with this move perhaps an attempt to keep them in the game			2
the team also found the majority of users tried the app because they thought it would be fun - rather than actually wanting to send salacious material			0
' respondents more commonly respond that they use @entity5 because it is fun , not because of its implied or actual security properties			2
' indeed , most respondents understand that @entity5 's message destruction is insecure , but they do not send sensitive messages ( such as sexual or legally questionable content ) more commonly because they do n't produce such content than because they do n't trust @entity5 or their friends			2
' a majority of respondents in the @entity2 study ( 53 percent ) had screen shots taken of their messages at some point , and slightly fewer ( 47 percent ) had taken screen shots themselves			0
five people admitted to using a separate camera to photograph a message , which prevents the sender from knowing his or her photo was captured			0
however , most people did n't seem to mind that their ' snaps ' were saved			0
snapchat chief executive officer ( ceo ) @entity111 : researchers say the firm 's product is used for ' fun ' messages rather than sexting when asked how they reacted to having a screen shot taken of their message , respondents " more commonly chose answer choices indicating neutral ( ' did n't care ' ) or positive ( ' thought it was funny ' ) reactions , " according to the report			0
despite the relative infrequency of sexting among the survey 's sample of users , the researchers found that @entity5 has a reputation for illicit messages that was discouraging some from downloading the app. among the 61 people who started the survey but failed to complete it because they had n't used @entity5 , several expressed concerns about the ' additional connotations ' of the app. @entity5 ' has a bad reputation ( for sexting ) , ' said one			2
another said it ' seems useful for only inappropriate content			0
' the researchers alos said they believed that there was a market for a more secure chat app. ' nevertheless , we observe that a non-negligible fraction ( but not a majority ) of respondents adapt their behavior in response to @entity5 's weak security properties , and thus conclude that these users may still have a use for a more secure messaging application in addition to the more casual , fun - focused @entity5 .			1

60 per cent of users said they used @entity5 for ' fun content '
fourteen per cent of those surveyed said they 'd previously sent sexts over @entity5
just 1.6 percent said they do so regularly
