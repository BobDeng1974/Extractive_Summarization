it is known as one of the most intrepid polar expeditions in history , and cost five men their lives			2
but over 100 years on from captain @entity8 ’s ill - fated trek to the @entity9 and back , two men have become the first people in history to complete the iconic 1,800 - mile route			1
at 1.15am gmt @entity13 , 36 from @entity14 and former wasps rugby player @entity15 , 32 , from @entity16 , completed the epic @entity18 trek			1
@entity8 and four companions reached the pole on 17 january 1912 , where they found that a @entity27 team led by @entity28 had preceded them by 33 days			2
@entity8 's entire party died on the return journey from the pole			1
some of their bodies , journals and photographs were discovered by a search party eight months later			0
for many years after his death , @entity8 's status as tragic hero was unchallenged , and few questions were asked about the causes of the disaster which overcame his polar party			1
the degree of @entity8 's personal culpability remains a matter of controversy among commentator , but it is thought that exhaustion , extreme cold and starvation definitely led to the men 's demise			2
they walked for 1,795 miles across the inhospitable landscape of @entity57 to set the world record for the longest polar journey on foot in history			1
it has taken them 105 days in total and pushed the limits of their mental and physical strength , as each men pulled sleds with over 200kg of equipment and walked on average 17 miles daily in temperatures as low as -46c wind chill			1
the entire trek was equivalent to 69 back - to - back marathons			0
mr @entity13 said , ‘ it is almost impossible to comprehend what we have achieved			2
' completing @entity8 ’s @entity18 expedition has been a life - long dream and i ’m overcome to be standing here at the finish			2
they walked for 1,795 miles across the inhospitable landscape of @entity57 to set the world record for the longest polar journey on foot in history captain @entity8 and his men ( pictured ) died having covered almost 1,600 miles of the route in their bid to become the first men to reach the @entity9 captain @entity8 , 1868 to 1912			1
@entity92 officer and @entity57 explorer			0
‘ the journey has been a mammoth undertaking that has tested the bounds of our bodies and minds each and every day			0
’ ‘ at times we found ourselves in dire straits in the intense cold , wind and altitude of the high plateau , weakened by half - rations and closer to the brink of survival than i had ever anticipated this journey taking us			0
‘ in that light , both @entity15 and i feel a combination of awe and profound respect for the endurance , tenacity and fortitude of captain @entity8 and his team , a century ago			1
’ captain @entity8 and his men died having covered almost 1,600 miles of the route in their bid to become the first men to reach the @entity9			1
they were pipped to the accolade on 17 january 1912 by a team of @entity27 explorers led by @entity28 and on their return journey died of a combination of exhaustion , starvation and extreme cold			2
while captain @entity8 ’s men had rudimentary equipment by today ’s standards , the two modern explorers were kitted out with gear from @entity133 , which managed to provide a @entity135 connection so that the explorers could blog about their adventure from arguably the most inhospitable place on the planet			1
the incredible journey : the @entity142 was a 1,800 - mile ( 2,900km ) , four - month return journey from the coast of @entity57 to the @entity9 and back on foot following @entity146 s route			1
it has taken them 105 days in total and pushed the limits of their mental and physical strength , as each men pulled sleds with over 200kg of equipment and walked on average 17 miles daily in temperatures as low as -46c wind chill			1
here , the two explorers rest in their tent and use their computers before embarking on another 17 mile walk the next day in the snow the explorers were kitted out with a @entity163 each built to survive in temperatures up to -40c			0
the computers sported a 4th generation @entity168 processor and provided @entity135 in one of the earth 's most inhospitable places			0
each computer weighed 870g and were prepared to have the minimum amount of programmes on them , which led the duo to create their own games on the laptops			0
they connected to the internet using an @entity183 satellite phone			0
the kit was charged using solar panels attached to the specially designed sleds			0
@entity133 tested the technology by freezing it in labs for months at a time to make sure it would work in the extremely cold temperatures			0
retracing @entity8 ’s original 1911 - 12 route , @entity13 and @entity15 started at @entity192 on the north shore of @entity194 on @entity195			1
they traversed the @entity197 , before climbing nearly 8000ft on one of the world ’s largest glaciers , the @entity201 , on to the @entity202 ; and onwards to the @entity9			2
from the @entity9 it was back the way they came , finishing 900 miles ( 1,450km ) later back where they began at the coast			2
