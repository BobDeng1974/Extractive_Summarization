a new @entity1 computer simulator has been designed to help doctors and midwives prepare for unusual or potentially dangerous births			0
the programme creates a model of the inside of a woman ’s body that can simulate the act of giving birth			2
it takes important factors into account that can help predict how easily a baby will be delivered , including the shape of the mother ’s body and the position of the baby			1
computer scientists are creating a virtual birthing simulator that creates a view of the inside of a woman ¿ s body that can simulate the act of giving birth ( pictured )			2
they said it can give ' patient - specific birth predictions ' that will help doctors and midwives deliver babies more safely computer scientists at the @entity34 , who invented the programme , said it will provide ‘ patient - specific birth predictions '			1
speaking at the @entity38 in @entity39 , dr @entity40 , who has led the project , said : ‘ we are creating a forward engineered simulation of childbirth using 3d graphics to simulate the sequence of movements as a baby descends through the pelvis during labour			1
‘ users will be able to input key anatomical data , such as the size and shape of the mother ’s pelvis and the baby ’s head and torso			2
‘ by doing this you will be able to set different bespoke scenarios for both the mother and baby , ’ he said			0
the simulation software will see ultrasound data used to re-create a geometric model of a baby ’s skull and body in 3d graphics as well as the mother ’s body and pelvis			1
programmers are also taking into account the force from the mother pushing during labour and are even modelling a ‘ virtual ’ midwife ’s hands that can interact with the baby ’s head			2
the simulation software will see ultrasound data used to re-create a geometric model of a baby 's skull and body in 3d graphics as well as the mother 's body and pelvis dr @entity40 said : ‘ because this programme is patient - specific , doctors and midwives will be able to see how a birth may take place before it has happened on a case - by - case basis			1
for example , you would be able to see if a baby ’s shoulders will get stuck			0
‘ we hope that this could help to avoid complicated births altogether by guiding people in the medical profession to advise on caesarean sections where necessary			0
’ the computer programme can currently run through scenarios based on previous births as well as modelling the physics of childbirth in unfamiliar birth scenarios , according to @entity114			0
the simulator can be used to train midwives , who currently learn by watching videos of births or using mannequins , neither of which show how a baby moves inside its mother			0
while the programme currently models one baby and pelvis , it does not recreate the movements of a foetus , or the movements of the muscles of the mother ’s pelvis but the researchers hope to build on their innovation so that it can handle additional factors			1
