@entity0 has warned his hugely success youth team players that there is little room in his squad for nurturing home - grown talents			1
the @entity7 are the reigning @entity8 champions and they reached their fourth consecutive final on wednesday night by defeating @entity10 5 - 4 on aggregate			1
the success story does not stop there as the under 19 side have also reached the semi-final of the @entity16 where they will play @entity17 across two legs in april			1
however , ahead of sunday 's visit to play @entity20 , @entity0 has warned the burgeoning stars that the pressure at @entity23 is to collect trophies , not produce players			1
@entity7 moved into their fourth straight @entity8 final after beating @entity10 on aggregate ' if they 're good enough and they 're ready then yes , ' @entity0 said when asked if having a core of home - grown talent was a target			1
' it 's important , but this club is a very demanding club			0
it 's a club where it 's not easy to play football			2
the level people demand is high , the pressure is big			0
' it 's not the same to play in a club where people just accept a so - so performance , or people accept a so - so result			0
or accept that you finish 5th , 6th , 7th or 8th			0
' this is not the best habitat for a young player to be developed			0
for a player to play in the @entity7 first team the player must be ready			1
there is no space with this level of demand , responsibility and pressure			0
there is no space to play a player who is not ready			1
' striker @entity61 struck twice on wednesday night to help the under - 18 side reach the cup final once again and also netted a brace in last season 's final second - leg when his side lifted the trophy ahead of @entity69			0
@entity0 says that the youth players must be ready to play before being promoted to the first team but even after making his @entity75 debut in a dead rubber group - stage match earlier this season , the wealth of imported talent means he is unlikely to get another first - team chance any time soon			1
' i played @entity61 winning 5 - 0 against @entity80 , in a competition where we qualified easily in the group phase , ' @entity0 said			2
' i can not play @entity61 against @entity84 with 30 minutes left at 1 - 1 , i ca n't			2
' @entity61 and the rest of @entity7 's finalists did get some additional reward for their heroics on wednesday night after club captain @entity89 was in the dressing room after the 5 - 2 win congratulating the young charges and offering advice			1
the @entity95 ' skipper is destined to one day take over as manager of the west @entity98 club , but @entity0 insists it will not be any time soon while the centre - back is still one of the best defenders in the @entity103			1
' he 's going to sign a new contract as a player , ' @entity0 said			2
' in a couple of weeks or a month we will have a notice for the press conference			0
@entity61 , pictured scoring against @entity10 , played in a @entity75 match against @entity80 ' for the next year at least i see him as a player and i do n't think it 's right for me to speak about him after that			1
' victory against @entity118 's side on sunday will take the @entity103 leaders one match closer to clinching yet another title			0
@entity122 has been in scintillating form for @entity7 and while his manager does not want to draw any additional attention to his player , he does warn the decision makers of his criteria for any @entity130 accolades			2
' in my old - fashioned way of looking at individual awards , for me individual awards only for the winners , ' he added			0
' i 'm never happy when somebody wins individual awards but does n't win the big prize , the collective one			0
if i was the guy to give awards , i 'd wait until the end of the season and it would always go to a champion			0
