the @entity16 finalists have been training at @entity1 's @entity18 complex and 17 - year - old @entity0 was asked to match up against arguably the world 's best player in a practice match at the weekend			1
@entity1 youngster @entity22 has been marking megastar @entity3 in training @entity3 and his @entity10 team - mates have been using @entity1 's @entity18 base to prepare for @entity13 friendly the @entity26 , who turned down @entity27 and @entity28 to join @entity1 two years ago , impressed observers including members of the @entity10 coach staff			1
and @entity3 took time out afterwards to give him a few words of advice			2
@entity0 said : ' i could n't believe i was defending against @entity3			2
i did n't tackle him as i did n't want to injure him ! ' it was great experience for me to train with one of the best players in the world			0
we did n't expect this			0
to see all those big stars playing with us			0
' the youngster , whose idol is former @entity45 left - back @entity44 , was too awestruck to ask @entity3 for an autograph but the four - time @entity48 winner took time out to speak to him afterwards			1
@entity0 added : ' he was talking to me about my family and then the @entity10 left - back was talking to me about my positioning and when i need to go forward or not			2
i did n't get anything signed , i did n't ask for it			0
' afterwards we were all talking about @entity3 because he got the ball at one point and dribbled past six or seven players			0
' here at @entity1 i 've trained against some of the best players in the world with our first team so i was n't really nervous but it helps a lot as a young player to come up against someone like him			0
it 's a different style , different class and they 've all been where we 've been before			0
i just hope someone took a photograph ! ' @entity0 's teammate @entity71 took his opportunity ; asking @entity3 to pose for a picture that he posted on his @entity75 feed			2
