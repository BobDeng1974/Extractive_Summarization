a couple who spent a lifetime paying off their mortgage have said it was a waste of time after a council scheme to sell neighbouring homes for just £ 1 has turned the street into a ' ghetto '			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , who raised their four children in their home in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , became mortgage free around 15 years ago			1
but eight years ago , the street became part of a regeneration scheme and the council bought properties and boarded them up ready for demolition			1
estate agents say the couple would now struggle to sell their home for much more than £ 1 as other houses in the street are being sold off at that price by the council			1
they thought that what the council was offering for their home at the time - around £ 85,000 - was too low and believed it was worth closer to £ 120,000			2
mrs @entity31 , 62 , a retired careworker , told the @entity45 : ' as the street has become a horrible place to live and my parents died last year we thought " enough is enough " and decided to take the council 's offer and move to a home that was similar in price to ours			2
' she picked out houses worth around £ 120,000 and the council said they would look into it for her in october , but months later the couple were told the offer had fallen through as their street was now part of @entity16 's ' home for a @entity65 ' scheme			1
now the hunters feel trapped as property prices have dramatically fallen in the area			0
an estate agent from @entity70 in nearby @entity71 said : ' i would estimate a three - bedroomed house like one in @entity14 would be worth around £ 60,000 at the moment but they would struggle to get even close to that			2
' it would be very hard for them to sell their home when other properties in the road are being sold for £ 1			1
' @entity31 , 62 , feels trapped in the area as property prices in neighbouring houses have dramatically fallen as the couple are unlikely to sell their home , they want the council to put its original offer back on the table			1
mrs @entity31 told the paper : ' we 've spent our lives paying off a property that is now worth virtually nothing			0
' who 's going to buy our house for thousands when they can get the house next door for £ 1 ? ' she added : ' the council created this ghetto that we are now trapped in and they feel they owe us nothing at all			1
' we watched our lively and friendly road turn into a ghost town			0
' there 's junk everywhere and we 're plagued with rats and fly tipping			0
we also have security cameras at the back and front of our house because of anti-social behaviour			0
' i 'm so frustrated as there 's nothing we can do about it and the lack of communication from the authorities makes it feel like we keep hitting a brick wall			0
' even if things do regenerate , it could take years , which means we are still stuck for a long time			0
' @entity16 city council said the fact some vacant properties in the area are being offered for £ 1 so that they can be renovated does not mean that other houses which are occupied are only worth £ 1			1
a spokesman said : ' homes for a @entity65 will see properties in this area which have long lain empty , derelict and rundown completely transformed , helping make this part of the city a thriving and sustainable community again			0
' this is really good news for existing property owners as it will mean the area is a far more desirable place to live			0
' the houses that are part of the homes for a @entity65 scheme require significant work and financial investment so ca n't be compared with other properties			2
we are in discussions with existing local residents to explain our exciting plans for this area			0
