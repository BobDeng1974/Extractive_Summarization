it ’s a habit that divides opinion , but new scientific evidence reveals that chewing gum is actually good for the brain			2
chomping away boosts thinking and alertness and the study reveals reaction times among chewers are up to 10 per cent faster			1
the report will be welcome news to celebrity gum chewers such as football manager sir @entity13 , who is rarely seen on the touchline without a stick of gum in his mouth			1
chomp - ian : sir @entity13 is rarely seen on the touchline without a stick of gum in his mouth the @entity21 research published in the journal @entity23 suggests as many as eight areas of the brain are affected by the simple act of chewing			1
one theory to explain the greater performance is that chewing increases arousal and leads to temporary improvements in blood flow to the brain			1
volunteers carried out tasks while chewing and not chewing gum as their brains were scanned to see which areas were active			0
during the 30 - minute tests participants pressed a button with their right or left thumb in response to the direction of an arrow on a screen			2
benefits : chewing gum increases arousal and leads to temporary improvements in blood flow to the brain men and women who were not chewing took 545 milliseconds to react , compared with 493 milliseconds among the chewers			1
the brain regions most active during chewing were those involved with movement and attention			0
professor @entity59 of @entity60 , a leading specialist in health - related behaviour , said : ‘ the effects of chewing on reaction time are profound			0
perhaps football managers arrived at the idea of chewing gum by accident , but they seem to be on the right track			0
’ ‘ our results suggest that chewing induced an increase in the arousal level and alertness in addition to an effect on motor control and , as a consequence , these effects could lead to improvements in cognitive performance , ’ said the researchers from the @entity71 in @entity21 , and other centres			0
however , research carried out last year suggested chewing gum could interfere with short - term memory			0
stimulating : chewing leads to the production of higher levels of insulin , which stimulates areas of the brain			2

tests show that reaction times amongst chewers are faster
chomping away leads to improvements in blood flow to the brain
report will be good news for celebrity chewer sir @entity13
