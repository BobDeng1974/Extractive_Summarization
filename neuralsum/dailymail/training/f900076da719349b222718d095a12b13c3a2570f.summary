in an emotional plea to the father - of - two , @entity8 called on him to end her torment and ' tell the truth ' over what happened to @entity14 , who was last seen alive by her family a decade ago			1
the then - 20 - year - old had turned to drugs and prostitution , and her remains were only found last year when @entity3 led police to her body			2

while there was considerable evidence against @entity3 for miss @entity31 ’s murder - including dna and cctv images linking him with her death - his confession to killing miss @entity14 was all police had in presenting a case against him			1

the senior detective , who was leading the hunt for @entity58 , failed to caution @entity3 , 48 , and denied him a solicitor			2
the ruling by @entity62 meant that @entity63 had no other evidence against @entity3 to link him to miss @entity14 ’s murder and the charge was withdrawn			1
he has refused to admit anything since			0
in a letter to @entity3 in jail , published in the @entity70 today , mrs @entity8 writes : ' my every waking moment is filled with the horrific thought of her terrifying , frightening moments as she suffered her death at your hands			2
' the nightmare never ends			0
please could you find it in your heart as a father to tell us the truth about my beautiful girl			1
' i am begging you , please , admit @entity87 ’s murder			0
