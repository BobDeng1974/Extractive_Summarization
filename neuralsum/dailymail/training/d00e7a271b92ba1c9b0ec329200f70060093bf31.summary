in another room , mr @entity1 and his team had allegedly left drinks bottles and other rubbish on the windowsills			2
smashed fragments of tiling lay on the floor , she added			0
and that is the state in which @entity38 ’ home was to remain			0
because after three weeks mr @entity1 walked off the job , pocketing the £ 4,960 she had paid him			1
it was already £ 360 more than his original quote			2
yesterday miss @entity0 , 47 , of @entity43 , @entity2 , said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others			1
as well as 60 minute makeover , mr @entity1 had appeared on @entity47 ’s you deserve this @entity49			2
he is also listed on the @entity51 talent agency as an actor and @entity54 impersonator			0
but miss @entity0 said he was demanding and careless and unwilling to do the work she was paying him for			2
she had to pay another £ 4,000 for a second group of builders to finish the job			1
‘ i just wanted to cause the minimum level of upset for my sons , ’ she said			2
‘ it ’s been a bloody awful year ... i just wanted to make this place nice			2

we do n’t take tea breaks , we just crack on			0
