a historic vote on growing demands for @entity2 to leave the @entity3 will be held in the @entity4 before @entity5			1
mps will debate whether the government should give voters a chance to decide the issue once and for all in a referendum			1
it will be the first time @entity13 has held a major vote on seeking the public ’s view since the 1975 referendum confirming the decision to join the @entity19			1
a historic vote on growing demands for @entity2 to leave the @entity3 will be held in the @entity4 before @entity5 if mps vote in favour of a referendum , the result would not be binding on the government			1
but , combined with growing public opposition to the increasing power of the @entity3 , it would put enormous pressure on @entity31 to let the people decide the country ’s @entity34 fate			1
the @entity4 vote has been forced on mps – and a reluctant prime minister – by public demand after the crisis in the eurozone , with desperate attempts to prop up the @entity44 economy , led to a surge in @entity47 feeling			1
mps will debate whether the government should give voters a chance to decide the @entity34 issue in a referendum the decision to hold a debate was made after a petition , signed by more than 100,000 people demanding a referendum , was submitted to a new group of mps given the job of making sure @entity13 does not sweep controversial issues under the carpet			1
the @entity64 has learnt that the @entity65 will agree to grant a one - day debate on a referendum after @entity13 returns next week			1
@entity65 chairman @entity68 , a @entity69 mp , said : ‘ given the crisis in the eurozone , this issue has become more relevant than ever			1
there is a clear majority of backbench mps who want to debate this and we have to respond to that			1
‘ the @entity3 today is completely different from the one the @entity2 people voted to join in 1975			2
it is time to examine the position again			2
for years it has suited successive governments to avoid debating whether @entity2 should leave the @entity3			2
the whole purpose of my committee is to make sure the big issues of the day are aired in @entity13			2
people in pubs and shops all over @entity2 are discussing our membership of the @entity3 and it is time mps openly debated it too			2
’ the debate will be held before the end of the year			1
anti-european campaigners are divided over the question that should be put in a referendum			2
some want a simple ‘ in or out ’ question			2
but others want to offer the choice of going back to an old - style trading association , along the lines of the @entity19 which @entity2 voters agreed to 36 years ago			2
if the nation voted ‘ yes ’ to this , the government could demand that key powers over immigration , health and safety , @entity108 regulations and other issues are handed back to @entity114			2
if the @entity3 refused , @entity2 could leave altogether			0
deputy prime minister and leader of the @entity118 @entity117 is an avowed @entity119			0
@entity69 mp @entity68 said the eurozone the issue has become more relevant than ever in recent opinion polls , when asked directly , nearly half of people want @entity2 to come out of the @entity3 , with about a third in favour of staying in			0
but when the question was rephrased to give the choice of returning to a @entity130 - style trade association , a clear majority chose that option			0
@entity132 @entity60 plan to use this week ’s party conference in @entity134 to step up their demand for a referendum			0
withdrawing from the @entity3 has support at the highest level of the party , including from mr @entity31 ’s senior no 10 adviser , @entity140			0
the @entity4 vote is a nightmare for the @entity143			1
mr @entity31 was heavily criticised in @entity144 for going back on a pledge to hold a referendum on the 2007 @entity147 which continued the process of switching sovereignty to the @entity3			0
he fears a referendum would be a distraction from his attempts to solve @entity2 ’s economic problems			0
but he will face a mass revolt if he orders @entity132 mps to vote against it			1
protests in @entity44 over cut backs			0
the crisis in the eurozone with desperate attempts to prop up the @entity44 economy has led to a surge in @entity47 feeling although deputy prime minister @entity117 is an avowed @entity119 , he made an election pledge to hold an ‘ in or out ’ @entity3 referendum			1
it was seen as a crude @entity118 ploy to prove that whatever their reservations about the @entity3 , most @entity2 want to stay in			0
but with growing hostility to the @entity3 , mr @entity117 may now be hoist with his own petard			0
a sizeable number of @entity69 mps also want a referendum			0
the historic @entity4 debate is set to be agreed after @entity132 mp @entity177 approached the @entity65 on the strength of the petition			1
the @entity181 mp said he would defy any attempt by mr @entity31 to silence him			0
‘ i will vote in favour of a referendum			1
it is time the people had their say			0
’ last night , despite the growing calls for a referendum , foreign secretary @entity188 insisted the government would not grant a public vote on leaving the @entity3 altogether – but said he would consider putting any future erosion of sovereignty to the people			1
‘ the @entity3 does have too much power , in our view , ’ he said			0
‘ but this is a @entity199			0
we have an agreed programme on which the @entity118 gave a lot of ground			0
‘ any large - scale change in the treaties is for future years			0
our place is in the @entity3			0
’ since @entity2 joined the @entity19 , there have been a series of commons votes on whether there should be referendums on @entity3 treaties such as @entity212 and @entity213 – although none on whether we should remain in the @entity3			0
all have been defeated , largely due to governments ordering mps to vote them down			1
the government has suffered three defeats as a result of debates ordered by the @entity65 , including rejecting a @entity34 bid to give prisoners the vote .			1

vote will be held in the @entity4 before @entity5
@entity228 crisis has led to surge in @entity47 feeling
