the number of men taking their own lives has reached its highest rate in more than a decade , with those aged 45 to 59 most at risk			1
new figures published today reveal men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women			1
experts warn the trend is down to the fact men are more likely to drink heavily , self - harm and are often more reluctant to seek help			1
moreover for those aged 45 to 59 suicide rates are likely to be higher because they are typically the ' hardest hit by redundancy and unemployment ' and see no way out			1
meanwhile leading charity the @entity21 said the figures are ' unsurprising ' in light of the still challenging economic climate			1
the number of men committing suicide has reached its highest rate in more than a decade with those aged 45 to 59 most at risk , new figures published by the @entity31 revealed ( file picture ) the @entity31 figures show a total of 6,233 suicides in people aged 15 or over in 2013 , up 252 deaths or four per cent on the previous year			1
the suicide rate in the @entity38 was 11.9 deaths per 100,000 of the population , with the male suicide rate reaching its highest level since 2001 , at 19 male deaths per 100,000			1
of the total number of suicides , 78 per cent were male ( 4,858 deaths ) , and 22 per cent ( 1,375 deaths ) were female , the @entity31 said			1
from 1995 to 2012 records show men aged 30 to 44 were most likely to take their own lives			1
but in 2013 , suicide rates among those aged 45 to 59 were highest , at 25 deaths per 100,000 - the highest for that age group since 1981 , and the first time the age group has recorded the highest overall male rate			1
in 2013 the only age group were male suicides fell was the 15 to 29 year olds age range			1
the @entity21 today called for greater focus on suicide prevention policies , particularly in areas with higher levels of deprivation			2
offering insight into why men are more prone to killing themselves , professor @entity65 , chair of the @entity66 , said : ' men are more at risk of suicide because they are more likely to drink heavily , use self - harm methods that are more often fatal and are reluctant to seek help			1
' fifteen years ago the rates among men under 35 were brought down sharply by tackling these problems and we need to use this success to address the problems of the new highest risk group , middle aged men			1
' we need to make it easier for men to find help without shame or stigma			2
' urging health bodies to see the figures as a ' wake - up call ' professor @entity89 , from @entity90 , said one of the reasons for the rise in suicides is the fact only around ' 15 per cent of those with depression and anxiety seek help '			1
she said : ' it 's a damning statistic			0
' effective treatment for depression exists but in general men are a minority of those seeking treatment for depression in the @entity107			2
' this could be because they are less willing or able to identify problems such as depression - or that they are less willing to ask for help			0
' we know that men , on average , do not use the @entity107 for physical health problems as readily as women			2
professor @entity65 , chair of the @entity66 , said : ' men are more at risk of suicide because they are more likely to drink heavily , use self - harm methods that are more often fatal and are reluctant to seek help			1
' ( file picture posed by a model ) ' mental health and psychological therapy services need to be made more attractive and accessible to men			0
' unemployment , depression and suicide go hand in hand			0
suicide rates may also reflect local economic conditions which could explain some of the regional variation			0
' she said it is possible those aged 45 to 59 are more prone to suicide because they have been ' hardest hit by redundancy and unemployment , and see no plausible improvement for themselves '			1
she added they may also find it ' particularly hard ' to help			0
she said as a whole mental health needs to be taken more seriously by society and called for a ' significant investment ' in research			0
in addition professor @entity89 said there must be a complete 're - think ' on how treatment is offered , if society is to tackle depression and suicide			2
women aged 45 to 59 had highest female suicide rate with seven deaths per 100,000 total female suicide rate was 5.1 deaths per 100,000 across the @entity38 in @entity162 the suicide rate was 10.7 deaths per 100,000 in @entity165 the rate was 15.9 deaths per 100,000 suicide remains leading cause of death in @entity162 and @entity165 for men aged 20 to 34 - accounting for 24 per cent of all deaths in 2013 also leading cause of death for men aged 35 to 49 years , accounting for 13 per cent of all deaths men aged 15 to 29 were the only age group to record a decrease in the rate of suicides in 2013 to 12.5 deaths per 100,000 from 13.6 in 2012 suicide also leading cause of death among women aged 20 to 34 in @entity162 and @entity165 , accounting for 12 per cent of all deaths reacting to the figures , @entity187 , samaritans executive director of policy , research and development , said : ' the excessive risk of suicide in men at mid-life continues to be a concern			1
' the rate for this group has now reached its highest level for more than 30 years			0
' these figures can not be ignored			0
' the charity 's @entity201 report concludes that men from lower socio - economic backgrounds , living in deprived areas are around 10 times more likely to take their own lives than those living in affluent areas			1
mr @entity187 noted the suicide rate in men varies dramatically across geographic regions			2
in the @entity213 rates were highest in 2013 , while @entity214 had the lowest suicide rate across the @entity38			2
he added : ' sadly , we know that suicide is an inequality affecting people in the most deprived areas from the most disadvantaged backgrounds			0
' the @entity221 on @entity222 and @entity223 recently reported on how varied local suicide prevention activity can be			0
' it found that around a third of local authorities do not collect information about suicide , do not have a suicide prevention action plan , or a multi-agency suicide prevention group			0
' this is an issue which needs to be urgently addressed in the context of rising rates			0
' @entity235 , chief executive of the mental health charity @entity236 , said : ' it is really shocking that men who are or could be in their prime of life should feel driven to such a state of hopelessness and despair for the future that they are taking their own lives			2
' our concern is the number of suicides which are preventable and the fact that when people with mental illness hit crisis point , there are no available beds or units and they are sent home from @entity258 and left to suffer in silence			0
' a @entity261 spokeswoman said : ' losing a loved one to suicide is a tragedy and one life taken by suicide is one too many			0
' @entity267 is backed by £ 1.5 million funding for research and we 've set a zero suicide ambition to tackle the assumption that some suicides are inevitable			2
' we 're also introducing the first ever waiting time standards for mental health , backed by £ 120 million investment			0
' and we 're taking action to improve crisis support across the country , with new standards set out in the @entity280 and investment in liaison psychiatry			0
