popular pooch : labradors are the @entity3 's favourite dog from bulldogs to border collies and great @entity6 to greyhounds , @entity3 is indisputably a nation of dog lovers			1
but now data has emerged which shows that the type of pooches we chose to take home as pets could be entirely down to postcode			2
an analysis of ten years ’ worth of microchip data has revealed for the first time @entity3 ’s favourite dog breed by area – with some startling results			1
by far , the most popular dog breed across @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 is the @entity26 , with more than 509,000 tagged by pet registration companies @entity27 and @entity29 in the past decade			2
in second place came the @entity31 with more than 376,000 animals tagged , while the @entity34 bull terrier was third , with 356,000 , according to the @entity35			1
the labrador retriever tops the list in almost every county , but there are pockets of areas in which @entity3 favour another – such as @entity43 , in the @entity44 , where @entity34 bull terriers are most popular , or @entity46 in @entity24 where @entity47 reign supreme			1
the data , which included five million dogs but excluded the numerous types of crossbreeds , also revealed that @entity52 was the most popular postcode for fashionable shih tzus , while greyhounds are the dog of choice in @entity58 , @entity59			2
and the @entity31 terrier is top breed for those living in the @entity59 of the @entity3 , with more @entity63 than any other dog being tagged in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , physical space also dictates the breed , with @entity72 choosing smaller dogs such as dachshunds while in the @entity76 , the most popular breeds are the large @entity47			1
she also told the @entity35 : ‘ labradors are very popular working dogs and are equally as happy spending a day out in the field or in the woods as they are curled up on the sofa with their family			0
’ the other breeds tagged most frequently by @entity27 and @entity98 include the cocker spaniel , @entity101 shepherd , golden retriever , border terrier , @entity104 , cavalier @entity105 and @entity106			0

prof @entity112 , of the @entity113 , who has researched the psychology of dog ownership trends , told the @entity35 that when choosing a dog ‘ sometimes the heart rules over the head ’			0
referring to the recent @entity120 trend for dachshunds , he said : ‘ they are certainly livelier than they look and can be a bit boisterous and aggressive , so they may not be the best dogs for small flats			0
by far , the most popular dog breed across @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 is the labrador retriever , with more than 509,000 tagged by pet registration companies @entity27 and @entity29 in the past decade ‘ people need to not only look at the size of the dog but the breeds and their temperaments			1
’ the data from the study was taken from the past ten years – the the average lifespan of a dog - from @entity27 and @entity98 , two of the @entity3 ’s three biggest microchipping firms , covering about 60 per cent of all dogs in the country			2
the @entity35 said crossbreeds were excluded as these are the most popular dog in all postcodes and have numerous permutations			0
it added that some dogs may have been incorrectly chipped while owners of breeds classed as dangerous dogs are less likely to get their dog chipped			0
from 2016 , chipping data may become a more accurate reflection of dog popularity , as it becomes the legal responsibility of all owners in @entity23 to chip their pet .			0
