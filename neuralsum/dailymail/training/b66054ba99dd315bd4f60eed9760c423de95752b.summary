in 2009 she told a health inquiry that midwives who assisted with home births needed proper funding and legal protection , in line with other countries			1
her written submission warned that ‘ lives will be in threat without proper midwifery assistance ’ from the state			0
she wrote : ‘ on a personal note , i am quite shocked and ashamed that homebirth will no longer be a woman ’s free choice in low - risk pregnancies			0
‘ as a homebirthing mother i will have no choice but to have an unassisted birth at home as this is the place i want to birth my children			1
’ mrs @entity0 had spoken of her excitement at her impending @entity58 october 19 , she posted a message on the @entity61 site for her massage business that read : ‘ maternity leave officially started this morning … had a beautiful last night at work and will keep you all posted on my burgeoning growth as a mother to be – second time round			1

a spokesman said : ‘ it ’s very , very rare			0
’ in @entity78 , about 1 baby in 50 is born at home and women are usually assisted through labour and birth by a professional such as a midwife			2

’ in the @entity20 , women are provided with @entity18 midwives if they opt for a home birth			1
but in @entity32 , women are discouraged from giving birth at home and expectant mothers must find a private midwife			1
