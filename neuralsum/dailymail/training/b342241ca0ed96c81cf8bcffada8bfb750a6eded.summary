published : 08:50 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 4 february 2013 binmen have been blasted by a great grandmother after they refused to move her one - wheeled bin for health and safety reasons - even though she managed it			1
widow @entity6 , 71 , who suffers from asthma and osteo - arthritis dragged the broken bin 50 feet down her driveway for it to be collected			1
but because its right wheel had broken off , refuse collectors declined to wheel it just a few feet to their truck			1
@entity6 's binmen refused to empty her wheelie bin for health and safety reasons after one of its wheels fell off retired bookkeeper @entity22 , from @entity23 , near @entity24 , @entity25 said : ' it 's unbelievable that i can drag the bin 50ft to the end of my driveway , but able - bodied men ca n't take it from the kerbside and have it emptied into the wagon just a few feet away			1
' i think they 're just lazy and being jobsworths			0
it seems to me they want the job done for them and they ca n't be bothered			0
' the incident occurred on friday after mrs @entity6 took her full bin out for collection as usual only for its wheel to fall off as she dragged it down her driveway			1
she added : ' i was just putting the bin out like i normally do for the bin men and the wheel came off			1
i 've had that same bin for thirty years , the wheel just fell off due to wear and tear			1
' it was still there when everyone else 's had been collected			0
they never even came to tell me why they could n't collect it and there was no note left on the bin			1
' i could n't believe it , i have never heard anything so ridiculous in my life			0
thirty years ago they used to carry the bins on their backs and they did n't even have wheels then , there 's none of that now , all they need to do now is drag it a couple of feet			0
if it 's due to health and safety , they 've all gone mad			0
' i managed to drag that heavy bin all that way a despite being old and only 5ft1 these young 6ft strong men could n't pull it a couple of feet			1
' i have been doing this every week and i 've never heard of such nonsense			0
@entity6 will be left without a rubbish collection until a new bin arrives to replace her broken wheelie bin damaged : @entity6 dragged the one - wheeled @entity90 despite suffering from asthma and osteo - arthritis ' when we called the council they did n't want to know , it 's just an excuse and there was no reasoning with the council when we got on to them			1
' ' they told me they could n't pick it up for a week and when i said it would be overflowing with rubbish they told me to leave it in bags next to the bin			1
' the thing is if anyone was to leave bags they would just not collect them and we would be in the same situation			2
' i have two cats and do n't want that rubbish leaving on the floor			2
it 's only monday but i dread to think what it 's going to be like on friday , because it will have accumulated			0
' to say that no one can come out of all those men who work for @entity125 is simply appalling			0
they are just being lazy , obviously it is too much trouble for these able bodied and burly men			0
' i ca n't say they have been very helpful about the situation , anyone would have thought that i 'd pulled the wheel off myself			0
i 've had that bin for thirty years , the council are just trying to cop out and are using any excuse not to do their jobs			2
' mrs @entity6 's son @entity138 said : ' it 's absolutely ridiculous that a 71 - year - old woman can drag a bin with one wheel to the end of her long driveway when 6ft tall , 15 - stone binmen ca n't empty it			1
' and i 'm also upset that she wo n't get another bin earlier			2
it seems to be all about what suits them			0
' @entity125 have offered to a supply a new grey bin free of charge			2
a spokesman said : ' the bin was not emptied due to the missing wheel			2
' it will be replaced free of charge next friday , the delivery day for this area , and any excess waste will also be removed next friday			0

@entity6 , 71 , is asthmatic and arthritic but dragged broken bin herself
binmen left rubbish *untouched* and will not collect it until she gets new bin
