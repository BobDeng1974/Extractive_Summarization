by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 08:50 est , 17 july 2013 costly mistake : @entity2 , 43 , faces a £ 4,000 bill after his daughter racked up the huge sum playing ' free ' games on his ipad a father has said he may need to sell his car and two motorbikes after his daughter ran up a £ 4,000 bill playing ' free ' games on his @entity7			1
@entity2 , 43 , had his bank account frozen when @entity14 , 8 , bought in - app extras while playing on the tablet using the password she had seen him entering when downloading items			1
@entity14 ran up a bill of more than £ 2,000 in just six days and more than £ 4,000 over the course of five months topping up rewards and enhancements in 74 transactions			1
mr @entity2 claims the schoolgirl was unaware she was being charged ' real money ' for the in - game purchases and asked to @entity28 to scrap the charge			1
but @entity28 has refused and he now faces selling off his car and two prized off - road motorbikes to recoup the money			1
mr @entity2 said : ' @entity14 is only eight and has n’t grasped the concept of money			1
she probably would n’t know how much a bag of crisps costs			0
' i was very surprised how dismissive @entity28 were			1
this was an eight - year - old girl			0
basically @entity39 have told me categorically that i wo n’t be getting my money back			0
' i am also disappointed that my bank did n’t alert me to what was going on			2
' now my dad is having to lend me money in the short term and i ’m in the process of selling my car , my son ’s off road motorbike and probably my bike too			0
' i just think these in - app purchases are terrible and people need to be aware			0
' mr @entity2 , from @entity53 , @entity54 , allowed @entity14 to use his @entity7 so she could play numerous games including @entity56 , my horse , @entity58 and @entity59			1
although the games are initially free to download there are numerous in - game extras that can be bought in the form of jewels , coins or upgrades			1
hidden extras : @entity2 let his daughter use his @entity7 to play games such as my horse , pictured , but the eight - year - old purchased lots of in - game extras that amounted to thousands of pounds ' deceptive ' : mr @entity2 criticised games such as @entity59 , pictured , for their in - app purchase systems mr @entity2 , an aerospace designer , said he was only alerted to the huge bill when he was prevented from withdrawing money from his bank			1
he added that messages alerting him to @entity39 purchases were going to his work email account - which he was unable to access as he was on deployment to another company			1
the father contacted @entity28 to explain the mistake but was told ' all purchases made on the @entity88 are final '			2
he said : ' there are numerous games where @entity14 had been inadvertently making in - app purchases , but the major culprits were @entity56 , @entity93 and @entity94 , a super hero game			1
' almost as bad are @entity58 , @entity97 and @entity98 ’ village			0
she just thought it was all free			2
' it was not until i grilled her that she said she had been using a password that she had seen me put in when i had downloaded free games for her			1
' she is only eight - years - old			0
even when i sat her down and explained that what she was doing had cost dad money , i still do n’t think she really understood			0
' @entity28 was today unavailable for comment			2
angry birds , pictured , was one of the games featured in a lawsuit in @entity113 over children running up huge bills on ' free ' games customers who accidentally rack up huge bills on @entity39 do not have an automatic right to a refund			1
but @entity28 announced earlier this year that it will pay out £ 66million in compensation to parents in the @entity113 whose children ran up massive bills using its free apps			1
youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents ' credit cards			2
now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund			0
however , the decision is unlikely to affect @entity135 families			0
a number of software companies have developed games that are popular with children			2
these ' bait apps ' let you buy credit in order to progress through the game			0
when children purchase ' currency ' , their parent 's @entity39 account gets automatically charged			2
@entity28 started requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in march 2011			2
but many parents around the world had already been hit by large and unexpected bills			0
a @entity113 legal case was triggered by a nine - year - old girl from @entity157 who bought $ 200 ( £ 132 ) of ' virtual money ' from three free @entity28 games			1
in a lawsuit brought by her father , the games were described as ' highly addictive ' and designed to ' compel ' children to buy game currency			2
under the terms of the case settlement , @entity28 agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $ 100million ( £ 66million )			1
the case involves games such as @entity172 , pictured above , @entity173 , @entity174 , and @entity175 , some of which are offered as free downloads on tablets such as @entity28 's @entity7			1
but the company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the @entity135 and any refunds are currently given on a case - by - case basis			0
the restrictions menu in @entity28 's @entity187 software lets you control in - app purchases , and can even be used to stop children downloading apps entirely			2
parents can set a password for in - app purchases or turn them off altogether			0
it 's also possible to prevent apps being deleted or installed and control access to age - restricted content			0
to prevent in - app purchases in @entity187 , open ' settings ' then choose ' general ' and ' restrictions '			0
then tap ' @entity203 ' , choose a pin and enter it a second time to confirm			0
now you can set restrictions from the menu below			0
in the ' @entity212 ' menu , slide ' in app purchases ' to ' off ' to stop children 's ability to run up bills .			0

@entity2 let his daughter @entity14 , 8 , use his @entity7 to play free games
but she managed to wrack up a huge £ *4k* bill buying rewards and upgrades
he did *n't* realise what she was doing until his bank froze his account
mr @entity2 has asked @entity28 to scrap the charge but company has refused
