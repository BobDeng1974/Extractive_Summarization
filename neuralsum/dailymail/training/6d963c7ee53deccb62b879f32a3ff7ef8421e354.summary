residents of @entity2 's tropical north know that you do n't go swimming in the sea at night because that 's when crocodiles are most dangerous			1
but @entity8 fisherman @entity7 did n't know the rules and happily dived into the waters off @entity11 - which is why he ended up with his head firmly between the jaws of a saltwater croc			1
it dragged him underwater , with his head locked between its teeth and attempted a death roll in which victims are spun around until they drown			2
' i did n't think about dying - i thought only about fighting to stay alive , ' he said back on his boat today after his ordeal			0
' i just feel that i 've been lucky and i just think if it was a bigger crocodile i maybe would n't have any head			1
' mr @entity7 intended to swim to a dinghy about 20 yards from the shore at @entity43 in north - east @entity11 , east of @entity44 , on a night when there was no moon			1
' i was just a short way into the water when it felt like a big stone or something coming on my head			1
i just thought for sure it was a croc and i started to think the only thing to do was to move my body as much as i could			0
attack : my head was in the crocodile 's mouth for less than a second , but it was long enough to give me two puncture wounds on the back of my neck ' said mr @entity7 ' he just hit me on the top , on the left side and on top of my neck and tried to push me down in the water			1
' mr @entity68 to his friends - said he managed to free his head by hitting the crocodile with his fists			1
' i punch him anywhere i could , ' he said			0
' but his weight and the power of him swimming pulled me about a metre under the water			0
' under the water the crocodile began to spin me around			2
' in his broken @entity79 he said he hit the croc under its head , then pushed it away which gave him the chance to escape			0
' my head was in the crocodile 's mouth for less than a second , but it was long enough to give me two puncture wounds on the back of my neck and another three or four punctures on each side of my head			1
' menacing : a saltwater crocodile - it was not fully grown , estimated to be eight to 10 feet long , but it would have been strong enough to have taken mr @entity7 's head off if it had managed a better grip ( file photo ) mr @entity7 was also scratched on his back where the crocodile had tried to grip him with its claws			1
once free , he swam frantically to the dinghy and climbed abroad , bleeding from his wounds			2
his work colleagues later took him to a medical centre for treatment			0
mr @entity106 , skipper of the fishing vessel on which mr @entity7 works said at first everyone thought the @entity8 was playing a joke			2
' it was n't until he got ashore and we saw the claret ( blood ) flowing that we realised it was real			0
' the crocodile was not fully grown , estimated to be eight to 10 feet long , but it would have been strong enough to have taken mr @entity7 's head off if it had managed a better grip			1
mr @entity7 's boss at a shipping company in the @entity122 , miss @entity123 , said he was extremely lucky			1
' the crocodile has been lurking around the area for the past few weeks , ' she said			0
' it 's got him by the head and rolled him and his instincts kicked in and he 's just started to punch into it			0
it released him , but then it came back again			0
' we 've walked out on the back deck and @entity68 's standing there with a big grin on his face and blood pouring out of him			0
' police officer @entity138 agreed mr @entity7 was ' very , very lucky that he managed to swim away - the outcome could have been a lot more dire			2
' it 's just a reminder that we live in the territory and where there is water , we have crocodiles			0
' mr @entity7 was able to treat the incident with good humour today .			2
