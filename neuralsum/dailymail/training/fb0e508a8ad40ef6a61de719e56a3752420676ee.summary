published : 06:13 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 3 september 2013 @entity1 prosecutors said monday they are investigating claims that a woman who killed two bus drivers last week in this northern border city was seeking revenge for alleged sexual abuse of female passengers			1
the claims made in an email from the self - styled ' bus driver hunter ' echoed deeply in @entity12 , which has a grim history of sexual violence against women aboard buses			1
a woman wearing a blond wig - or dyed hair - boarded one of the school bus - style vehicles that serve as transport in @entity12 on wednesday morning			1
pink crosses mark the place where eight women were found murdered in @entity12 : the city has a terrible reputation for violence and sexual assault she approached the driver , took out a pistol , shot him in the head and left the bus			1
the next day , apparently the same woman did exactly the same thing to another driver on the same route			0
over the weekend , media outlets began receiving emails from the address ' @entity43 the hunter of bus drivers			1
' ' i myself and other women have suffered in silence but we ca n't stay quiet anymore , ' the email said			1
' we were victims of sexual violence by the drivers on the night shift on the routes to the maquilas , ' a reference to the border assembly plants that employ many residents in @entity12 , across the border from @entity61 , @entity62			1
' i am the instrument of vengeance for several women			2
' the newspaper @entity66 reported that a witness quoted the killer as telling the second victim , ' you guys think you 're real bad , do n't you ? ' before shooting him			2
@entity43 the goddess of the hunt , in a bronze statue @entity43 was worshipped in ancient roman religion and is revered in @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity78 believed she was the goddess of the hunt , the moon and birthing and was associated with wild animals and woodland			0
they believed she had the power to talk to and control wild animals			0
@entity43 therefore , reflects the heavenly world ( diuum means sky or open air ) in its sovereignty , supremacy , impassibility , and indifference towards such secular matters as the fates of mortals and states			1
at the same time , she is also seen as active in ensuring the succession of kings and in the preservation of humankind through the protection of childbirth			0
@entity43 was known to be the virgin goddess of childbirth and women			1
she was one of the three maiden goddesses , @entity43 , @entity108 and @entity109 , who swore never to marry			1
as goddess of the hunt , @entity43 often wears a short tunic and hunting boots and is often portrayed holding a bow , and carrying a quiver on her shoulder , accompanied by a deer or hunting dogs			2
like @entity119 , she was portrayed as beautiful and youthful			0
the crescent moon , sometimes worn as a diadem , is a major attribute of the goddess			0
authorities have not verified the authenticity of the email , or of a @entity128 page set up under a similar name august 31			0
but @entity130 , spokesman for the @entity133 state prosecutors ' office , said the vigilante claim is considered one of the working hypotheses in the crimes			2
there was no apparent robbery involved in the killings			0
' now that we have the email in the case file , it indicates that this could have been someone who had a run - in with a driver or one of his relatives , ' @entity130 said			0
the government announced it will put undercover police aboard some buses and conduct weapons searches to prevent further killings , and said a citywide search for the suspect is already on			2
' we have a police sketch of the suspect and we are looking for her , ' municipal police spokesman @entity157 said			2
many of the women murdered during a string of more than 100 eerily similar women 's killings in @entity12 in the 1990s and early 2000s disappeared after boarding buses			1
their bodies were often found weeks or months later , raped , strangled and dumped in the desert or vacant lots			0
@entity1 's @entity12 which sits on the border of the @entity171 , just south of @entity62 , has not only become synonymous with a bloody drug war - but also for violence against women of horrific proportions			1
the number of reported women murdered each year is in the hundreds ; and hundreds more are reported missing			0
the murders hit their high in 2010 , when 304 women were found dead			0
media reports helped curb the violence against women but last year it was reported to be back just as bad			1
by mid 2012 at least 60 women had been killed in the city , according to the @entity186 and at least 100 were reported missing			2
human rights activists claim they fear people in @entity12 are not alarmed by the horrific violence against women because they think it is normal , it is so engrained in the social culture			1
the local government has made pledges to take the killings more seriously			0
however , it is often difficult to arrest , let alone prosecute in the city , according to campaigners			0
killings are the result of jealous husbands , jealous fathers - in - law , women killing women and other reasons , reports have said			0
organizations to aid the families of the missing women have sprung up in recent years , helping them band together to find out what happened to their mothers , daughters and sisters			0
several bus drivers were arrested in connection with those killings , but the cases against them always appeared weak , or their confessions coerced			1
one driver had his conviction overturned , and his co-defendant , another bus driver , died in prison before sentencing			0
the head of the @entity227 , @entity226 , said that perhaps the killer ' or someone close to her suffered some abuse by one of these guys			2
' ' it 's a fact that there are sexual abuse cases on the bus routes , but it 's no greater than women disappearing from the streets in downtown , in human trafficking rings , ' @entity226 said			1
but , she added , like the still - unresolved identities of most of the 1990s killers , ' the most tragic thing is that the public may never know what the truth is			0

police claim shootings were revenge for alleged sexual abuse of passengers
