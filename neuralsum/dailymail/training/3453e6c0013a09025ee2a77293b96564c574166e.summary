warning : professor @entity0 , of the department of educational studies at @entity3 private school girls who are under intense parental pressure to excel are being driven to eating disorders , an academic has warned			1
they are being treated as ‘ projects ’ by middle - class parents who push them too hard to achieve in music and sport as well as exams , it was claimed			1
but the stress of striving to be ‘ perfect at everything ’ can lead to anorexia , bulimia and binge - drinking , according to professor @entity0 , of @entity3 , @entity19			1
she warned that the pressure to succeed is particularly intense at private schools , where pupils feel they must conform to the stereotype of the straight - a pupil			1
professor @entity0 will next week tell the heads of top private schools ’ girls they should start telling some girls they are ‘ doing too much ’			1
girls also need a ‘ hard dose of reality ’ about the sexist world they face when they leave school , she will tell the annual conference of girls ’ @entity38			2
speaking ahead of the event , the academic , a professor of education , warned that girls face further pressure to fit in with their classmates and avoid being excluded by cliques			1
girls who are sociable and successful may find friendships more difficult since those who are popular may not actually be well - liked , she said			1
stress is also caused by leading ‘ overscheduled ’ lives in pursuit of perfection and a desire to ‘ live up to expectations ’			2
‘ girls are under pressure as never before ’ , professor @entity0 told the @entity53			1
‘ there are girls in private schools who are “ projects ” of their parents , learning two or three instruments to grade eight standard and excelling in sport and academia because they feel that is what is expected of them , and that is what they expect of themselves			1
’ concern : @entity0 , of @entity3 , is worried there is too much pressure on school girls ( file picture ) ‘ but a few of them end up in anorexia clinics complaining that their schools only cared about their results			1
‘ good schools need to start saying : “ you ca n’t do that many a levels , even if you want to			2
” ’ ‘ the schools need to start looking at girls , saying : “ this is too much , you do too many things			1
” ’ she added : ‘ in middle - class families it ’s not just about doing well at school , they have to be fabulous all - rounders			1
‘ schools give them that message to an extent that to stand out from the crowd they must be a fantastic human being as well as doing really well at gcses and a levels			2
’ the professor also said it was important for schools to avoid turning young women who expected to have four children , a fulfilling career and a full social life			1
‘ if you ’re being picked on that ’s awful , but if you ’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school , keeping out of it ’ ‘ you want to keep them aspirational , but you want them to be confident enough to say , “ i do n’t want this ” , if it is too much , ’ she said			0
girls also need to be warned about the ‘ very serious glass ceiling they could confront , ’ she added			2
in a separate interview , she described research into friendship groups among girls			2
‘ these friendship groups frequently have low tolerance for difference between group members and keep each other under constant scrutiny , excluding those who do n’t make the grade , ’ she said			0
‘ we need to be aware that it is frequently those girls who appear to be the most socially successful for whom this is a problem , and to act rapidly when problems come to our attention			0
these are likely to be the tip of a much larger iceberg			0
’ concern : the impact of a demanding school life could drive some school girls to anorexia , it has been warned ( file picture ) she added : ‘ there is a lot of pressure to be top of the social group , but often girls who are popular are n’t well liked - they ’re feared because they ’re dominant			1
‘ one group we studied at a school was very dominant and they kept constant surveillance on each other , checking they had their socks rolled down in the exact way and that their hair was done properly			0
‘ this was a very affluent school			0
they all had long blonde hair and highlights and all wore designer clothes outside school			0
there was pressure to be beautiful all the time or you were letting the group down			0
‘ one of the girls was whispered about because her ponytail was n’t how it should be , and it took her all day to realise what was wrong , then she was mortified			0
' the “ terms ” of the group can change overnight without a member realising			0
girls further down the pecking order do n’t notice how their socks should be			0
‘ if you ’re being picked on that ’s awful , but if you ’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school , keeping out of it			0
’ on its @entity197 website , offers advice and support to parents of girls , the @entity189 ’ @entity38 points out the ‘ danger of expecting “ the best ” from each girl ’			2
‘ the fall from dizzy heights of success can be a painful experience and undoubtedly it can be lonely at the top , ’ it says			0
‘ our job is to ensure that the girls are ready and armed to cope with such challenges and the inevitable ups and downs			0
