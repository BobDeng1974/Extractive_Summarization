sex advice was a lot more simple in the @entity2 , says psychotherapist @entity3 in the @entity5 documentary @entity6 the current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography , according to a psychotherapist			1
@entity3 , 57 , has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships			1
the mother - of - one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been			2
an agony aunt for @entity24 magazine and @entity25 , she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice			1
the wife of @entity33 - winning artist @entity32 , 54 , she said : ‘ these days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography			2
they get a skewed idea about sex , thinking women have to be one way and it ’s all about submission and domination when of course it is n’t			1
‘ people get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography			2
i ’m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools			2
the danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is			2
’ this naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice			1
while it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex , the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography , often depicting aggressive and violent sex , at too young of an age			2
she said ‘ it ’s worse now , but i ’m an old person so i would say that			0
’ she highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life			0
she said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that ‘ it ’s a huge problem in society			0
’ mrs @entity3 , who is also a trained psychotherapist , made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for @entity5 , broadcasting tonight			1
@entity6 , lies and love bites : the @entity90 interviews advice columnists , from @entity91 to the women behind @entity100 ’s @entity93 and @entity94 , to looks at how these columns reflect society ’s changing attitudes , especially towards sex			1
@entity32 , 57 , wife of @entity33 - winning artist @entity32 , has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships @entity107 , who wrote the @entity109 column between 1981 and 1982 , said the internet has changed everything			1
she told mrs @entity3 : ‘ there was no social media [ in the 1980s ]			1
now you would google a problem , we were the 80s @entity117 really			0
they were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit , they did n’t know what was going to happen			0
they did n’t have sex education , mainly at schools			0
’ @entity125 , who filled the same role for two years from 1974 , said she saw herself as the readers ’ ‘ big sister ’ imparting advice			0
this is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists , such as @entity91 , who answers readers ’ queries for @entity134			1
he said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them			1
@entity32 interviews @entity141 from publications such as @entity109 and @entity144 magazine for the @entity5 documentary , airing on tuesday night at 9pm he told the programme : ‘ agony aunts and uncles , across time immemorial , are not always right			1
you ’re in an odd position , where you ’re meddling in strangers ’ lives and you ’re judging a whole situation by one side , you do n’t get the other side			0
‘ women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not , they are just doing			2
most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy			0
‘ women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are			0
so do n’t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else			0
’ one of the big changes mrs @entity3 has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help			1
she put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes			0
she said : ‘ there is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves			0
it may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous			0
