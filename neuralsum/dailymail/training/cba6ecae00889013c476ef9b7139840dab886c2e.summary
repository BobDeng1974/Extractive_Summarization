by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 supremo @entity2 feels the sport needs to crank up the volume to improve the show			1
but after hearing first hand the quieter noise of the new 1.6 - litre @entity10 turbo - charged power units - compared to the more visceral @entity11 - at a circuit for the first time this season , @entity2 believes the sound levels are not as bad as many have criticised			1
@entity20 @entity19 chairman @entity18 claimed @entity2 was ' horrified ' by the drop in decibels after watching the season - opening race a fortnight ago on television			1
making a noise : @entity2 was in the paddock on friday after missing the opening race of the season attending this weekend 's race in @entity30 at the @entity31 , although the 83 - year - old could hold a conversation in the pit lane , he was not unduly concerned			1
' it 's a little louder than we thought , so if we can just get it ( the noise ) up a little bit more then it would be all right , ' said @entity2			2
' it sounds terrible on tv , but the problem is n't that , it 's about the people coming here and the whole atmosphere of @entity3			2
' people said you could n't hear anything , but it 's not true			0
it just needs to be a bit louder than we have now			0
' issues : @entity56 was disqualified from the season - opening race in @entity20 following a fuel irregularity in the fast lane : @entity60 experienced more issues with the fuel - flow sensors during practice for sunday 's race meanwhile , @entity60 experienced more issues with the contentious fuel - flow sensors during practice for the @entity30 @entity19 , raising the prospect of another showdown with @entity3 officials similar to the one that resulted in the team 's disqualification in @entity20			1
@entity56 was excluded in @entity75 after finishing second , because race stewards said @entity60 exceeded the new fuel flow limit of 100 kilograms per hour			2
@entity60 blamed the issue on faulty readings from the @entity82 - approved fuel sensors and subsequently appealed			2
the sensors on @entity56 's car malfunctioned again at @entity31 , team principal @entity85 said , showing a discrepancy with the team 's own fuel - flow readings			1
@entity85 said he would talk with race director @entity89 if the problem persisted on saturday , in the hope of avoiding another post-race drama			0
' if we do n't ( get synchronised readings ) we will find ourselves in an awkward situation , but one we will try to work with the @entity82 on , but we will find ourselves in the same dilemma as @entity75 , ' @entity85 said			0
we will have that conversation with @entity89 and hopefully we can agree on something that is sensible			0
' we need a better way of measuring and monitoring the fuel flow , or say you get rid of it and you have 100 kilograms for the race and that 's it			0
personally , i think it would be easier to get rid of it			0

@entity2 says the cars sounds ' louder than we thought '
but the @entity3 chief wants the noise level turned up
the 83 - year - old is in @entity30 after missing the opening race of the season
@entity60 experience more *difficulties* with fuel - flow sensors during practice
