by @entity0 published : 17:32 est , 27 november 2013 @entity2 : 17:32 est , 27 november 2013 whenever those seasonal surveys come around about how much time women spend getting ready for @entity7 parties , everyone always misses the point			1
getting ready is the fun part			1
my pre-party prep always begins with a bath and a sneaky ' dressing drink '			1
the ideal addition is @entity18 ( not because i particularly like @entity19 5 , but because the idea of bathing in it makes me feel glamorous ) and a gin and tonic ( @entity25 ’s and fever - tree ) with ice and a slice of lime			1
given that combination , i have been known not to bother going out at all			1
but assuming one must , it 's good to plan ahead			2
be prepared : pre-party prep includes planning for the morning after so before you 've even decided which shoes to wear , prepare for the morning - after			1
put a large glass of water by the bed , a couple of paracetamol , two @entity39 and a packet of @entity41 ( £ 4.50 , boots.com )			2
this little kit will come in extremely handy later on , when you roll back home smelling of illicit cigarettes ( honeshtly , i never normally shmoke ) and wine			2
the @entity51 are particularly excellent because apart from being alcohol - free ( and by now you are wishing you were , too ) they will get the worst off without requiring much in the way of hand - eye co-ordination			1
but let 's not get ahead of ourselves			2
a party is one of the few occasions when it 's worth bothering with a primer , especially if there are photographs involved and you do n’t want to look like you ’ve been imbibing port since breakfast			2
@entity67 ( £ 11.99 , boots.com ) does a great job of controlling shine and glossing over open pores and fine lines , creating a matt , but moisturized canvas			2
i would do your foundation and concealer last , so you do n’t have to worry about making a mistake			2
if you have the time and money , and if your diary is chock - a - block with parties , i would also consider investing in eyelash extensions			1
done now , these should last well into the new year , and they will completely eliminate the need for mascara			2
flutter ( fluttereyes.co.uk ) do an at - home service which spans the country and they can give you anything from the most subtle of sets to a full - on @entity95			1
they are very low - maintenance and lightweight , but the difference is remarkable			1
i get mine done twice a year , once around now and once in the summer			2
@entity7 is the time of year when many women also decide to take the plunge and do a red lip			2
again , if you know what you ’re doing , great ; if not , caution is advised			2
a bright red nail is just as festive , and a lot easier to carry off			2
but if you insist on red lipstick , be sure to use a liner			2
this is the difference between looking like a pro and a child who has gone mad with a crayon			0
@entity116 's @entity115 ( £ 14.50 , maccosmetics.co.uk ) coupled with @entity118 's @entity117 from the @entity120 collection ( £ 35 , spacenk.com ) is a killer combination			0
give yourself a few layers , blotting with a tissue in between ( red lipstick on your glass is n't sexy , it 's slutty ) , and top with a clear gloss for a super-glamorous finish			1
for an absolute fool - proof eyeliner , i would invest in one of @entity135 's new @entity134 pencils ( £ 19 , charlottetilbury.com )			1
and now for the morning - after			1
my favourite cure for hangover face ( puffy , baggy etc ) is to suck on an ice cube			0
get rid of any excess make - up and bring your skin back to life with @entity144 ( from £ 8 , glamglowmud.co.uk ) , a ten - minute treatment mask that will tighten , brighten and generally put some life back into your face			1
apply @entity148 ( £ 23 , harveynichols.com )			0
this water based , liquid cream concealer instantly erases under - eye circles , redness , dark spots and overindulgence damage , and makes you look like you ’ve had 12 hours ' sleep			1
finish with a swirl of your favourite blusher , a large cup of hot sweet tea and , wherever possible , a sausage sandwich			0
it is the morning of my first training session with mr @entity164 and @entity165 himself , super-celebrity trainer extraordinaire , @entity168			1
with the help of a warm spoon , i manage to encase my lower body in the pair of @entity174 leggings ( size l ) that he kindly sent me			0
i have on my special new sports bra - and baggy old top , which i vainly hope conceals the worst			1
' you 're not taking me to school like that , ' says my daughter			0
' why , what 's wrong ? ' i reply as casually as i can while struggling to breathe			0
whipping @entity0 into shape : personal trainer @entity168 ' seriously ? have you seen yourself ? ' i take a look in the hall mirror			1
we compromise : i will drop her , but do not get out of the car			0
then it 's straight to @entity168 's gym at the @entity196 in @entity197 before anyone else sees me			0
the atmosphere is a bit like one of those scary cocktail parties where everyone is either richer or thinner than you , or possibly both			0
matters are not much helped by the fact that not only do all the clients look like supermodels , so do the trainers			0
thankfully , @entity168 himself looks rough			0
he 's just got back from @entity213 via a private client in @entity215 , and he has jet - lag and a weepy eye			1
@entity218 ... @entity219 , £ 42 , liberty.com every girl needs a good blusher / powder brush , and this is it			0
those bright red bristles are also fabulously festive			0
@entity223 ... the @entity224 in @entity225 the spa is closing its doors next year			0
i remember when this was the place to be seen			0
a shame … but part of the decline in day spas			1
physique like a demi - god , of course ; but still , it 's a crumb of hope			1
our session starts with a glass of swamp water ( chlorophyll ) and hip and leg raises , which do n't tax me unduly			1
i do the plank , then he puts an elastic band around my ankles and makes me walk up and down like a crab			0
all the while he chats away about this and that , a mixture of gossip , instructions and terrible jokes			0
the jokes are bad , but they break the ice , and soon we are nattering away like old friends			0
the exercises go by in a flash : he 's attentive , but lets me find my own pace			0
@entity168 's whole technique seems to be the opposite to most trainers , who are vocal about pushing yourself , always trying to get you to do more rep , one last squat			0
by contrast , @entity168 seems non-judgemental , almost pathologically laid - back			1
his training style is fluid : if it is n't working , we move onto something else , always tweaking and changing			1
i 've never encountered this sort of gym - nudge theory before			1
before i know it , we are done , and i am sitting on a mat feeling rather pleased with myself and drinking a nice smoothie			0
i emerge awash with endorphins			0
i am so excited about the new me , i contemplate buying some proper gym kit in nearby @entity280			0
thankfully , i catch sight of a rotund woman wearing an ill - advised pair of shiny black leggings in the shop window , and think better of it			1
there 's still a very , very long way to go .			0

getting ready is the fun part
but do n't forget to prepare for the morning - after
