@entity10 ’s pressurized helmet began to fill with water , covering his eyes , ears and nose , while he was carrying out a space walk at the @entity16 in july			1
blinded by the water , @entity17 relied on his memory to get him back to the airlock cabin and had to be pulled back inside the space station by his fellow astronauts			0
however , @entity10 ’s spacesuit had already had a leak a week before , on july 9 , a fact which will be brought up in today ’s report , according to @entity36			2
mr @entity10 was at the beginning of a six - and - a - half hour spacewalk with @entity40 colleague @entity39 when cooling water began streaming from the air vent in his space suit and into his helmet			1
' it was like walking around with your eyes closed in a fishbowl , ' @entity10 said in a @entity4 video describing the malfunction			2
' we have a problem ' : a video shows the conversation between @entity10 reporting the dangerous problem and a flight controller back in @entity23 teamwork : @entity10 ( right ) describes the water leaking into his helmet during the incident on july 16 last year , which saw him need the help of @entity40 astronauts @entity39 ( right ) and @entity63 ( center ) to get back into the @entity16 ooops : more than seven months later , @entity4 is set to admit that @entity10 's space suit had suffered a leak the week before , on july 9 ' it 's just a very uncomfortable feeling to be with your face under water for all that time			1
' ' i was just lucky to be back inside in no time			0
' the suits worn by astronauts when outside pressurized cabins are known as evas , extra-vehicular activity suits and were designed 35 years ago			0
@entity4 man : @entity10 was the first @entity24 in space astronauts wear a liquid - cooled garment under the suit which serves to regulate body temperature			2
it was the cooling water used in this under - suit that experts suspect began to leak into @entity10 's helmet			1
' the water - if it had continued to leak much more , it would have been very serious , ' @entity39 said a separate @entity4 video released tuesday			0
@entity39 explained that the cooling water somehow got into @entity10 's ventilation system			1
the helmet of the suit has an air vent that blows oxygen from behind the astronaut 's head			0
water bubbles built up then began leaking water from behind @entity10 's head into the helmet , saturating his communication cap and filling up to cover his nose , mouth and ears			1
' once the water got big enough that it went all the way around and started coming outside the edge of the white plastic piece , then it saturated his communication cap , and sort of capillary flow just brought the water all around his head , ' @entity39 explained			0
' he had water filled up in his ear cups , and it started to creep into his eyes and covered his nose			0
' an investigation was carried out by @entity4 engineers in @entity23 , however only the second incident involving @entity10 ’s spacesuit was reported .			0

astronaut @entity10 's helmet began leaking on a spacewalk in july
cooling water covered his ears , nose and mouth , and he nearly drowned
only now is @entity4 admitting that it was the second leak on the same suit
