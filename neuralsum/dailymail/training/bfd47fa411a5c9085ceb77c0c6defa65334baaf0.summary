by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor problem : around 60 per cent of children have been asked to take an explicit self - portrait on their mobiles teachers should look through pupils ’ mobile phones to delete sexual photos , a minister said yesterday			1
@entity12 , a @entity13 minister , said young people had to be taught about the risks of sending intimate photographs of themselves by text , email or instant messaging – a practice known as ‘ sexting ’			1
but he came under pressure to go further and ban teenagers from owning smartphones if they are caught using handsets for bullying			1
the @entity27 revealed last year that as well as being shared on teens ’ smartphones , tens of thousands of explicit self - portraits taken by teenagers are ending up on websites viewed by paedophiles			0
children 's charity @entity33 also warns that young people are taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images			2
some are being driven to the brink of suicide when photos sent to one person they think they can trust become widely shared online			2
the government has given teachers powers to search pupils for any electronic device , which human rights groups claimed amounted to an ‘ excessive ’ intrusion into children ’s lives			1
opponents likened the new rules to police controls to investigate terrorists			0
but mr @entity12 insisted teachers must take responsibility for images on pupil ’s phones , if they are being used to intimidate and harass other children			1
he told the @entity61 : ‘ we have given teachers stronger powers to tackle cyber-bullying by searching for and , if necessary , deleting inappropriate images or files on electronic devices , including mobile phones			2
‘ it is critical to educate young people about the risks of sending intimate photographs			0
’ however , unions said it was not the job of teachers to police the contents of pupils ' devices			0
@entity81 , general secretary of the @entity82 , said : ' it is completely inappropriate for teachers to be placed in the position of ‘ policing ’ pupils ’ phones			0
' schools can make a valuable and important contribution to advising pupils on how to keep safe when using the internet and social media but it is not teachers ’ responsibility to scrutinise and censor phones			0
' @entity13 @entity12 said teachers now have the power to delete images from phones , but @entity103 mp @entity102 called for a smartphone ban for bullies the @entity106 has drawn up specific guidance for teachers on how to tackle sexting in schools			1

but @entity103 mp @entity102 called for the government to go further and ban children from using smartphones altogether if they are caught using sexting images to bully other pupils			1
she said : ‘ many young people have been pressured into sending intimate photographs of themselves only to find that those images are sometimes posted , distributed or shared without their consent , which is an important form of bullying and harassment			2
’ she asked mr @entity12 : ‘ what measures have been taken , and do you support measures to prevent smart phone use by those who are not mature enough to understand that it can result in an important form of bullying ? ’ charities warn that some children are being driven to the brink of suicide after photos they have taken became widely shared but mr @entity12 insisted : ‘ there are numerous laws in place that can be used to deal with those who behave in this appalling manner			1
’ @entity33 director , @entity149 , said the rise of classroom sexting was linked , in part , to the widespread availability of porn online			2

it seems like everyone 's doing it			0
' @entity155 said he still engaged in sexting despite the dangers			0
' i do worry about who is behind the phones of the people i sext with - obviously if you do n't know the person in real life there 's no guarantee they are who they say they are , ' he added .			0
