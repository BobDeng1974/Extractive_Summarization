by @entity0 they say a brand can live or die by its name , and @entity4 , a @entity7 native and professional wordsmith , has found she has an unusual talent for finding just the right ones			1

word wizard : @entity4 , pictured , is paid up to $ 50,000 for coming up with names for products including snacks , sunscreen , social networking sites and serums a former copywriter for @entity42 , the ad agency giant responsible for clients including @entity45 and @entity46 to name but a few , ms @entity48 quit writing ads and ' turned in her corporate @entity50 ' nine years ago to start the company of her dreams , scoring her first major client via a @entity55 date			1
so why are companies willing to pay so much for a few or even just one word ? ' a name will last longer than any other investment you make in your business , ' ms @entity4 tells @entity62			1
' it makes a critical first impression			2
even more than your shoes			0
' where the magic happens : ms @entity4 works out her colorful @entity7 office , pictured , and is renowned for creating catchy names that ' make you smile , not scratch your head ' and she has a point			1
it may only be a carbonated drink , but @entity76 , for example , is the number one most recognized word in the world , second only to ' hello '			0
and though many seasoned marketers agonize for months over what to name a new drink , burger or nail polish shade , ms @entity4 , whose prices start at $ 15,000 , says : ' i can do it with my eyes closed , ' before adding , ' honestly , writers block has never happened to me			1
' it generally takes around three weeks of working with a client and bouncing ideas around before @entity94 settles on the right name and cashes the hefty check , although ms @entity4 claims the perfect name can often hit her straight away			1
food for thought : most of the company 's first clients were products that make people ' fat and drunk , ' including @entity30 ' even if we do think of the perfect name right off the bat , we still do a full exploration , just to be sure we are right , ' she points out			1
the name for her own company came to her ' a flash , ' she says , noting that many of her first clients were food and beverage companies			2
' i started out naming things that make people fat and drunk , ' she remarks , so eat my words seemed like a perfect fit			0
what 's in a name ? ms @entity4 , who also counts @entity33 as a client , claims she is enthusiastic ' even about the driest products ' ms @entity4 explains that there are several common mistakes people make when naming their products			1
' names that are n't spelled the way they sound are frustrating for customers , ' she says , ' as well as names that are meaningful to you but not your audience			0
' she gives poorly - conceived names including @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 as examples			0
as for products she has crowned with great names , there 's i have a @entity147 for a coffee company , @entity149 ' for an all - female bar tending service , stuff a sock in it for a chain of laundromats and @entity155 for a male - friendly nail salon			0
ms @entity4 is unable to disclose some of the more famous brands she has worked her magic with , including a nationally recognized bacon cheeseburger , whose parent company would perhaps rather not reveal where some of its brightest ideas came from			1
around a quarter of her projects are made up of renaming existing products that are in need of a makeover			0
ms @entity4 recounts influencing a 25 % jump in revenue for a hotel 's wedding business , simply by changing up the ' ho - hum ' names for their services to ones that are more ' emotionally engaging			2

the word wizard , who works out of a jazzy office in @entity7 ’s @entity198 district , more reminiscent of a @entity31 house than a thriving marketing agency , claims she is always enthusiastic , ' even about the driest products ' and , at the end of the day , operates by her philosophy that a name should ' make you smile , not scratch your head			2
' she is currently writing a book on naming called @entity207 , my name is @entity208 - how to create @entity209 that @entity214 , for those who want great names but ca n't afford her services , which will be released in september .			0
