by @entity0 viewers of the @entity2 might have noticed over the years that the winning song is rarely the best			0
and while critics of the contest have suggested the outcome is driven by prejudice and is stitched - up at the @entity10 ’s expense , scientists have discovered other ' hidden ' voting patterns			1
they found that votes are based on a combination of loyalties tied up with culture , geography , history and migration			1
nil point for discrimination ! @entity21 might have won the @entity2 ( pictured ) in 1974 with a cracking song , but a study has found that hidden voting patterns play a part in deciding the winner			1
people 's votes are driven by loyalties based on culture , geography , history and migration - but not discrimination the study said people ’s votes are based on loyalties based on culture , geography , history and migration and not discrimination			1
‘ our analysis found no convincing evidence of negative bias or discrimination against anyone - no country really has any enemies , ’ the @entity41 - based statisticians said			1
migration patterns might be an explanation for why some countries often vote for certain others			2
in line with previous findings , the data suggests that voting congregates within four broad groups of nations that tend to give each other points			1
the model also revealed the presence of repeated voting behaviour over the years			0
statisticians at @entity64 ( @entity64 ) and @entity65 analysed voting patterns over the past two decades to identify the patterns and found no evidence to support sir @entity70 ’s criticism that the contest is marred by blatant bias and discrimination			1
instead they think migration can tip the balance in favour of musical acts from certain countries , which will compete to win this year ’s @entity2 on may 10			2
‘ migration seems to be an interesting explanation for some of the patterns that we see in the data , ’ said dr @entity79 of @entity64			2
‘ for example , @entity86 seems to be scored highly by @entity89 voters , possibly due to the large number of @entity86 people who have migrated to @entity89 , and potentially tele - vote from there			0
‘ but our analysis found no convincing evidence of negative bias or discrimination against anyone - no country really has any enemies			2
’ all friends really : the study identified migration as one reason for cultural alliances being formed between certain countries , but the analysis found no convincing evidence of discrimination against anyone - no country really has any enemies @entity65 ’s @entity113 analysed how countries have given points to each other since @entity2 introduced tele - voting in 1998			1
in the study , published in the @entity119 , the duo used computer analysis to reveal clusters of countries with similar voting behaviours and identified the probability of each country belonging to a particular voting bloc in any particular year			0
patriotic : @entity86 seems to be scored highly by @entity89 voters , possibly due to the large number of @entity86 people who have migrated to @entity89 , the study found			0
balconies in @entity130 are pictured in line with previous findings , the data suggests that voting congregates within four broad groups of nations that tend to give each other points : one combining the former @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , one covering central and southern @entity142 ; plus a larger bloc which includes the former @entity145 bloc as well as the @entity10 , @entity146 and @entity147 , which divides more - or-less randomly into two groups each year			1
‘ in our analysis we used what we call a “ bayesian hierarchical formulation ” to model the scores , ’ said dr @entity113			0
‘ we took into account factors like the language of the song and the gender of the singer both of which have known effects on the votes			0
this left behind an underlying trend for us to measure			0
‘ this trend is based on cultural and geographical similarities , as well as migrations of people			0
’ the model also revealed the presence of repeated voting behaviour over the years , but the researchers said that data can only suggest whether there is bias			0
‘ to prove something stronger like “ discrimination ” or “ favouritism ” , we would need more complex data , for example polling on people ’s motivations for voting the way they do , ’ dr @entity79 said			2
looking at the results country by country , @entity183 seems to be systematically favoured by its close neighbours @entity188 and @entity189 , amidst a general delivery of positive votes , which is thought to be driven by widespread migrations of @entity183 citizens across @entity142			1
@entity194 mapped : in line with previous findings , the data suggests that voting congregates within four broad groups of nations that tend to give each other points : one combining countries including the former @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 ( red ) , one covering central and southern @entity142 ( blue ) ; plus a larger area which includes the former @entity145 bloc as well as the @entity10 , @entity146 and @entity147 ( yellow ) , which divides more - or-less randomly into two groups each year the @entity10 has friends , in the form of @entity146 , @entity209 and @entity210			1
however the effect was not substantial in the vast majority of these cases and thus does not have a dramatic impact on the likelihood of a given performer winning			0
negative bias was virtually invisible in the study and the statisticians said that no country systematically gives any other low points - meaning there is no evidence of prejudice or discrimination against anyone			1
in the case of @entity189 , which was consistently relatively unpopular in the voting , the effect was very small and the authors did not consider this to statistically demonstrate a negative bias			0
despite claims to the contrary , the @entity10 ’s entries do not seem to be systematically shunned by the rest of @entity142			1
‘ it is likely that other factors beyond those we have studied explain most of the voting behaviour in the @entity2 , as the patterns we observe are relatively weak , ’ dr @entity79 said			0
hitting a bum note ? the @entity10 has friends in the form of @entity146 , @entity209 and @entity210			0
but such alliances were not found to have a dramatic impact on the likelihood of a given performer winning - and were not enough to save the @entity10 's 2003 entry , @entity251 ( pictured ) being awarded nil points			2
