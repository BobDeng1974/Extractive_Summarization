@entity4 came two days early when the @entity6 ’s @entity5 won in overtime on what is likely the most unusual goal ever scored in hockey history			0
monday night ’s game against the @entity12 was tied 1 - 1 in overtime when goalie @entity14 ’s save of a @entity5 shot sent the puck straight up into the air – what happened next may never happen again			1
the center tried in vain to swipe the puck away from the goal as it tumbled back down to the ice			1
the puck then somehow ended up in the back of mr @entity14 ’s pants			2
look ! look ! : @entity5 players shout to the refs and point at the puck sitting in the back of mr @entity14 's pants is it a goal ? : the referee can clearly see the puck in the back of mr @entity14 's pants - and across the goal line - but a video review was used to confirm the score without a clue as to where the puck was , the goalie instinctively backed into the net to block whatever shot may have come at him			1
that ’s what cost his team the game			0
when he backed into the net , his pants crossed the goal line – with the puck inside			1
@entity69 players began shouting and pointing at the puck inside the net while in the goalie ’s pants			0
a video review confirmed the goal , giving the @entity5 the bizarre win			2
clearly a goal : though video replay was used to confirm the goal , the puck is clearly visible inside mr @entity14 's pants - and , crucially , across the goal line better lucky than good : the win was only the 10th of the season for the last place @entity5 it was @entity5 player @entity89 's first goal of the season , and only the second of his career			1
a @entity5 announcer was in disbelief			0
‘ i ’ve never seen anything like this before , ever			0
’ it was only the tenth win of the season for the last place @entity5 .			2

@entity12 goalie @entity14 saved the *initial* shot , but the puck went straight up in the air
it then somehow tumbled down the back of his pants
the goalie had no idea where the puck was and instinctively back into the goal , causing the puck to cross over the goal line
it was only the 10th win of the year for the last place @entity5
