by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:14 est , 24 february 2014 updated : 00:01 est , 3 march 2014 the recent arrest of @entity5 drug cartel kingpin @entity4 ' @entity4 means the next man in line will be expected to stand up - and now he may have been identified			1
@entity8 , 66 , and from the same rural area of @entity10 as @entity4 , is a close confidant of the jailed drug lord , and is considered to be the brains behind the operation			1
' he is everything , ' a @entity15 official told the @entity17			0
' @entity4 was seen by officials as the muscle			1
the longer - term fate of a criminal ring likened to an international corporation is anything but clear , as authorities pursue other top leaders and weaker rivals dream of moving in - but @entity8 seems firmly in control , at least for now			1
top dog : @entity8 is said to have taken over the @entity5 drug cartel from @entity4 ' @entity33 ' @entity4 @entity8 is less flashy , according to a @entity17 profile , but is still known to law enforcement - @entity15 officials have long offered a $ 5million reward for information leading to his capture			1
the rural farmer is well entrenched in the @entity41 , according to a 2010 profile in @entity43 cited by the @entity17			1
he is respected by those both inside and outside of the organization - which is likely key to keeping it together			0
he and @entity4 grew up together in rural @entity10 and rose through the ranks of the cartel together , an official told the @entity17			1
@entity8 told @entity43 that he and @entity4 are ' compadres ' who ' talk on the phone regularly , ' the case for him being placed at the top even if he does not want the title			1
' everything indicates that @entity57 will stay at the front of the organization			0
what 's less clear is whether , with the detention of [ @entity4 ] , his business model will come to an end , ' an official told the @entity17			1
@entity8 prefers to hold back on drug supplies instead of flooding the market , an easy way to drive up both demand and prices , as well as influence			1
@entity71 is also violent , but much less out in the open , according to the @entity17			0
he prefers to single out victims instead of leave the mass graves that have become a @entity41 hallmark in recent years			2
a @entity76 official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss specific details of @entity4 's arrest in @entity10 said the agency does n't anticipate that @entity4 's absence will have an immediate effect on cartel operations because it has evolved from a gang into a worldwide organization			2
the operation did not touch the cartel 's immense political power , nurtured through the bribery of corrupt officials , or its thriving money laundering operations			0
in this saturday , feb. 22 , 2014 photo , @entity100 " @entity4 is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by @entity10 navy marines at a navy hanger in @entity99 , @entity10			2
@entity4 , the head of @entity10 's @entity41 , was captured overnight in the beach resort town of @entity102			1
( @entity0 photo / @entity104 ) ' as long as these other structures remain in place , all things being equal , @entity5 will be able to continue to operate if not as normal , at least as the most powerful criminal organization in @entity10 , ' said @entity109 , director of the @entity110 's @entity111			1
@entity4 , who made @entity113 's lists of billionaires and most powerful people , was first among equals with @entity8 and @entity117 , known as " @entity118 , " both of whom remain at large			1
@entity4 worked closely with @entity8			1
@entity121 , former head of @entity10 's top domestic intelligence agency , said the pair shared a clear vision , not only with respect to their adversaries but also with their business plan for trafficking cocaine , marijuana , heroin and methamphetamine in some 54 countries			0
in other recent takedowns of major cartels , the @entity10 government had to hit more than one leader before the organizations were dismantled or scattered into smaller gangs			0
one by one , the @entity142 brothers in @entity143 were arrested or killed over the last decade , as were the @entity145 brothers from 2008 to 2011			0
though the @entity10 marines killed @entity150 leader @entity149 in october 2012 , the power of the group did not diminish until the other leader , @entity151 , was arrested last summer			0
despite the continuity provided by having @entity71 at the top , some predict @entity5 is about to suffer the same fate			2
@entity15 rep. @entity156 , who chairs the @entity157 , said to expect more arrests because authorities penetrated the cartel 's communications system in catching @entity4			2
' our ability to crack their code will not bode well for their future , ' he said , comparing @entity4 's capture to the 1993 killing of @entity170 of @entity171 's @entity161 , once a powerful criminal organization			2
its demise helped grow cartels such as @entity5			2
when @entity170 fell , " ' he cartels started to unravel			0
' in fact , some fear @entity4 's capture could spark more violence , though no @entity10 cartels seem strong enough at the moment to make a major play			2
long known to officials : @entity71 has operated out of the public spotlight , but has long been under scrutiny @entity5 's main rivals , the @entity185 , have been substantially weakened , and other groups have become too local to rival @entity4 's international reach			1
since @entity4 escaped from a @entity10 prison in 2001 , he grew his cartel to be one of the largest in the world , with tentacles extending from @entity193 to @entity194			1
nobody outside the cartel leadership knows the extent of its power or business , but estimates are that @entity5 handles 25 to 45 percent of all drugs entering the @entity15 , with revenues around $ 3 billion a year			2
last year , @entity113 named @entity4 the world 's 67th most powerful person , between @entity15 speaker of the house @entity206 and @entity209 executive editor @entity208			0
@entity5 is believed to operate with an extended network of officials and lookouts on the payroll , especially in the western @entity10 state for which the cartel is named			0
both a state and federal police chief have been arrested for alleged ties to @entity5 or its allies , only to later be released			0
when the @entity10 marines mounted their offensive on saturday , it was without alerting any local law enforcement			0
' local and state authorities are in the service of the @entity41 , ' @entity224 said			0
even though the long - term fate of @entity5 is unclear , everyone agrees on the bottom line : the drugs will still continue to flow , even with the takedown of other @entity10 cartels			1
' in drug trafficking , as long as there is demand , there will be a supply , ' @entity121 said			0
' it 's like energy			0
you ca n't create or destroy it			0

@entity8 , 66 , grew up with former @entity5 boss @entity244 ' @entity4
he has been quoted in the past as saying they talked often
@entity8 has long been considered the brains of the @entity41 , @entity4 was viewed as the muscle
