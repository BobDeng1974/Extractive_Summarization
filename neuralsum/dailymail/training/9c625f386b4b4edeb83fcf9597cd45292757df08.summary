by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 21:05 est , 31 january 2013 ' we love each other ' : mr @entity3 said he and his wife @entity4 did n't get married because they were offered £ 3 a week @entity3 prompted @entity7 anger last night as he poured scorn on ‘ odd ’ proposals for tax breaks for married couples , saying a few pounds a week would not encourage people to get hitched			1
the deputy prime minister confirmed he would not support @entity7 plans to recognise marriage in the tax system , insisting : ‘ you do n’t need the taxman to tell you whether you should get married or not			1
’ @entity19 is today expected to restate his ‘ absolute commitment ’ to introducing tax breaks for married couples , while indicating that they are not likely to be unveiled until next year ’s budget			1
but his @entity23 deputy , who will join @entity24 in opposing the measure , said yesterday : ‘ if you say to someone , “ oh , would n’t it be nice to be given some help to get married ? ” , they ’d go , “ oh , that ’s a good idea ”			1
‘ but if you think about it a bit more it would be odd , would n’t it , to say people who chose not to get married have to pay higher tax			1
‘ that ’s why my party does n’t support the idea of a transferable tax allowance for married couples			1
‘ the more people will look at this , the more they will think			0
why should you be giving , whatever it is , £ 3 a week to married couples ? ’ @entity7 @entity45 expressed alarm that mr @entity3 was denouncing the idea in such terms , given his party ’s commitment to abstain			1
@entity51 , mp for @entity52 , said : ‘ this is just part of the sneering , liberal view of people that do the right thing			0
‘ we know @entity3 is not very good at following the details of the coalition agreement but if he has such a big problem with this issue , why did n’t they say they would vote against ? ’ @entity66 mp @entity65 added : ‘ only someone from a privileged background like his could be as dismissive as he is of £ 3 a week			2
he shows a complete disregard and lack of understanding of regular families			0
’ @entity19 is being urged by some @entity7 mps to use the promise to introduce a marriage tax allowance to buy off opponents of gay marriage plans @entity3 used his weekly phone - in to argue against a marriage tax allowance @entity7 mps say the need to introduce the marriage tax break is more urgent than ever , given that the government is preparing to unveil support for working women to help pay for childcare			1
a minister admitted the plans could penalise stay - at - home mothers			1
@entity90 , a @entity91 spokesman in the @entity92 , admitted there could be problems associated with a ‘ tax relief - based scheme ’			1
the lord bishop of chester @entity97 asked @entity90 whether it would be ‘ unfair to introduce this tax relief for working parents with children while denying effective tax relief through transferable allowances to those parents who choose to stay at home with young children and who are currently penalised through the tax system ’			2
@entity90 replied : ‘ obviously one of the problems with simply having a tax relief - based scheme is the one that the right reverend prelate refers to			1
that is why we are looking at a number of options , some of which are tax based and others of which are not			2
’ mr @entity3 , conducting his weekly radio phone - in on @entity124 , conceded that marriage was ‘ incredibly important ’			1
‘ i mean , marriage is the best thing that ’s ever happened to me , but i tell you , @entity4 and i did n’t get married because we got offered £ 3 a week			1
we got married thankfully because we love each other and that ’s what most people ’s views are about marriage			1
’ culture secretary @entity136 , left , has said recognising marriage in the tax system is ' important ' while @entity7 mp for @entity140 , right , has challenged ministers on the progress of the policy under mr @entity19 ’s plans , it is expected that one member of a married couple or those in civil partnerships would be allowed to transfer £ 750 of their tax - free personal allowance to their partner , reducing their partner ’s tax bill			1
this would be worth £ 150 a year to basic - rate taxpayers			2
the coalition agreement struck between the @entity160 and the @entity23 committed the government to introducing the allowance , but gave the @entity23 special permission to abstain			1
that means that even with @entity24 voting against , it should still pass into law			0
- more than a third of working mothers want to quit their jobs to look after their children , a major government - funded study found yesterday			2
the survey , conducted among 6,350 parents for the @entity175 , also revealed that rising numbers of mothers are deciding to stay at home , either by choice or because of spiralling childcare costs			0
the proportion of mothers with full - time or part - time jobs has fallen from 63 per cent to 60 per cent in just a year			0
analysis : by @entity185 and @entity186 another year ; another @entity3 attack on proposals to support marriage through the tax system			2
the @entity23 leader first derided the @entity7 idea in late 2010 , saying it was equivalent to taking the ‘ 1950s model of suit - wearing , bread - winning dad and aproned , home - making mother , and trying to preserve it in aspic ’			1
but far from being backward - looking , giving tax breaks to married couples would merely bring @entity202 in line with the rest of @entity205 – something one might think would appeal to mr @entity3 ’s @entity208 tendencies			1
under our system , married couples are actually punished financially – with experts estimating that most married couples with children are losing £ 100 a week compared to single parents who live alone			0
@entity205 is divided into two groups on the issue			0
the first offers married couples either transferrable tax allowances that can be swapped between spouses , or tax credits that are shared between a married couple			2
the countries in this system include @entity226 , @entity227 , the @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , the @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234			0
the second group favours income - splitting , in which the income of the husband and wife is added together then divided into two for tax purposes			1
if the wife does n’t work , or works part - time , this can bring a significant reduction in the husband ’s tax liability			1
this system is used in @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255			0
here we look at how marriage is recognised in the tax system of four @entity260 countries : @entity248 families are taxed as a unit , rather than individually as in the @entity202			0
the tax allowances – the amount they can earn without being taxed – refer to the whole family rather than each member			0
it means a mother who stays at home to look after her children will not lose out because the family ’s tax allowance would be the same if she went to work			0
@entity249 couples can decide to be taxed either individually or jointly			0
if they decide to pay tax jointly , their tax allowances are doubled – whether or not they are both working			0
child tax credits are doubled if the couple decide to be taxed jointly			0
it means that a mother who decides to stay at home to look after her children will not lose out			0
married couples also get help with mortgages , cheaper health insurance and get tax relief if they make repairs to their home			2
and , to encourage young mothers to stay at home , they are paid a child - rearing allowance until the child is two			0
@entity231 @entity231 has a system of individual tax registration , meaning everyone gets the same allowances , regardless of their marital arrangements			0
however , marriage is recognised in the system because there are tax credits for spouses – meaning families get something back from the @entity305 if they are married or cohabit			2
it also means that when a mother stays at home to look after her children , the family will not lose out			0
@entity234 the tax allowance for married couples filing jointly is higher than the allowance for unmarried or separated individuals with dependent children			2
this means there is a cash incentive for those who stay together and agree to be taxed together .			0
