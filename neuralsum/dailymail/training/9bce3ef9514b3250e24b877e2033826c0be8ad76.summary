by @entity0 tens of thousands more veterans than previously reported are forced to wait at least a month for medical appointments at @entity4 hospitals and clinics , according to an updated audit of 731 @entity8 medical facilities released on thursday			1
the updated report includes new figures showing that the wait times actually experienced at most @entity8 facilities were shorter than those on waiting lists for pending appointments			1
for instance , new patients at the @entity18 waited about an average of 44 days for an appointment in april , the new report said			2
but the average wait for pending appointments at @entity24 was 66 days			0
acting veterans affairs secretary @entity25 speaks during a news conference at the @entity27 in @entity28 on wednesday to release the results from its @entity30 similar disparities in average wait times were found around the country			2
pending appointments , for example , do n't include patients who walk into a clinic and get immediate or quick treatment , @entity8 officials said			2
they also do n't reflect rescheduled appointments or those that are moved up because of openings due to cancellations			0
@entity8 officials said the two sets of data complement one another , but both are evidence that many veterans face long waits for care			1
more than 56,000 veterans were waiting more than 90 days for an initial appointment , the new report said			1
' in many communities across the country , veterans wait too long for the high quality care they 've earned and deserve , ' acting va secretary @entity25 said thursday			2
the department has reached out to 70,000 veterans to get them off waiting lists and into clinics , @entity25 said , ' but there is still much more work to be done			2
' the report released thursday showed that about 10 percent of veterans seeking medical care at @entity8 hospitals and clinics have to wait at least 30 days for an appointment			1
that 's more than double the 4 percent of veterans the government said last week were forced to endure long waits			0
this 2007 file photo shows @entity76 , a veteran 's facility in @entity28 @entity25 called the increase unfortunate , but said it was probably an indication that more reliable data was being reported by @entity8 schedulers , rather than a big increase in veteran wait times			0
administrators at local @entity8 medical centers questioned the results of an audit released june 9 , which looked only at pending appointments			0
the report did not match internal data on completed appointments showing waits actually were far shorter , the local officials said			0
the reliability of both sets of data is in question			0
the @entity8 is investigating widespread manipulation of appointment data by schedulers following an uproar over since - confirmed allegations that dozens of veterans died while awaiting appointments at the @entity8 medical center			1
some 13 percent of schedulers surveyed by the auditors reported being told by supervisors to falsify appointment records to make patient waits appear shorter			0
the @entity8 's inspector general has cited a since - abandoned performance bonus system as a reason for the falsifications , which schedulers used to mask frequent , long delays in treatment for veterans			1
@entity8 secretary @entity121 resigned three weeks ago amid an election - year firestorm over the treatment delays and waiting list problems at @entity8 facilities nationwide			1
@entity127 veteran and amputee @entity126 swings a driver while at the gait and motion analysis lab at the @entity4 hospital where many veterans must wait up to a month for an appointment @entity121 took the blame for what he decried as a ' lack of integrity ' through the @entity8 network , which serves nearly 9 million veterans			1
the @entity142 and @entity143 have approved separate bills to allow more veterans who ca n't get timely va appointments to see local doctors listed instead			0
the proposals also would make it easier to fire senior @entity8 regional officials and hospital administrators			0
the june 9 audit found that more than 57,000 veterans were waiting at least 90 days for their first @entity8 medical appointments , and an additional 64,000 appeared to have fallen through the cracks , never getting appointments after enrolling for va care within the past 10 years			1
the new report said the number of veterans waiting more than 90 days dropped to about 56,300			1
about 46,400 veterans still have never gotten an appointment despite seeking one over the past decade , the report said			2
@entity25 , who replaced @entity121 may 30 , said he still is not 100 percent confident that all wait times listed on @entity8 computers — and its audits — are accurate			1
' i have vastly greater confidence in the quality ' of wait - time data being reported by @entity8 employees , he said during a speech this week in @entity28			0
" but i ca n't look at the entire database and say it 's correct either			0
