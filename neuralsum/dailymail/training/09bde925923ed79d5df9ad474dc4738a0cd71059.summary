by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:15 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 05:20 est , 14 january 2014 waste : soldiers have been told to stop ' firing off ' unused rounds of ammunition at the end of training exercises cash - strapped army officers have ordered soldiers to cut the amount of ammunition they use			1
bullets unused during training exercises must now be returned to stores to help save money , instead of being fired off by troops			2
the army penny - pinching emerged as leaked documents showed the @entity20 has wasted millions of pounds on a botched computer system			1
the armed forces have been forced to save billions by cutting troop numbers , equipment budgets and deployments			0
now senior officers have told soldiers to stop the practice of firing off left over bullets at the end of training exercises , the @entity26 reported			0
one squaddie revealed in a letter to soldier magazine revealed that despite the financial crisis faced by the military , officers still tell them to ‘ start bombing up , we ca n’t take any ammo back ' even when bullets are sealed in boxes			0
officers claim that it is ‘ too much paperwork when we return them ’ ‘ it ’s good training to feel what full automatic feels like ’			1
lt col @entity49 , of the @entity51 ’s ammunition management department , replied : ‘ it is unfortunate that some unit personnel appear to have engaged in ammunition “ firing off ”			0
‘ such behaviour is wasteful and there can be no excuse for it			2
’ the @entity20 said the ‘ firing off ’ is ‘ wasteful ’ and has been banned			1
but the ministry faced fresh criticism about waste over its bungled handling of an it system to recuit thousands of new reservists and full - time personnel			0
the @entity67 , a £ 1.3 billion scheme intended to enable the @entity51 to recruit online , is almost two years behind schedule and will not be fully operational until april 2015 at the earliest , the @entity66 said			2
up to £ 15.5 million has been spent on the computer system , but according to the newspaper , the problems are so serious that defence secretary @entity73 is considering spending nearly £ 50 million on a new solution			1
according to a confidential report by technology research company @entity77 , the @entity51 's recruitment wing picked the wrong bidder to build the it system after failing in 2011 to challenge an @entity20 policy that favoured the less suitable of two competing offers			1
defence secretary @entity73 has been urged to get a grip on the bungled it project which has already cost millions the project management team was inexperienced and under - resourced and when delays started the @entity51 failed to take charge and put in a suitable contingency plan			1
mr @entity73 was being urged to pay @entity88 , the @entity20 's partner in the project , £ 47.7 million to build a new it platform			1
a briefing note sent from the @entity20 's director general finance @entity93 to mr @entity73 in december recommended scrapping the flawed it system and paying @entity88 to build its own model			1
he wrote : ‘ if the @entity96 hosting solution is not put in place then the @entity20 risks not gaining the appropriate number of recruits needed			2
given recent criticism of army recruitment			0
and the use of reserves , this would lead to further negative media reporting and reputational damage for @entity20 ’ another briefing note revealed that the @entity20 will incur additional costs of £ 1 million a month until the it problem is resolved			1
shadow defence secretary @entity111 said : ‘ this leaked report points to the latest series of catastrophic failures at the @entity20 on @entity116 's watch			1
the @entity51 is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 while the newly - renamed @entity51 - formerly the @entity51 - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000 ‘ @entity117 warned that the @entity118 was taking risks with @entity121 's security by not fixing the reserve recruitment crisis before reducing numbers in the @entity124			0
we specifically raised the worrying it problems and @entity88 's performance as causes for concern			2
but the government recklessly pressed ahead			0
‘ now we learn that the problems were worse than anyone thought and still have n't been fixed			0
the blame for this latest fiasco - which is wasting £ 1m of taxpayers money every month - lies squarely with government			0
‘ @entity73 needs to get a grip and sort this shambles out			2
’ the @entity51 is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 while the newly - renamed @entity51 - formerly the @entity51 - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000			0
in a paper lodged in @entity140 in december mr @entity73 said that recruitment in 2013 ‘ has been well below historic levels ’ and acknowledged there were problems with the it system			1
an @entity20 spokeswoman said : ‘ in december last year we acknowledged a number of problems with the @entity51 and @entity88 recruitment partnership			1
ministers have gripped these problems and put in place a number of fixes to correct the issues that had emerged			0
‘ as we have previously said , in the medium - term we are building a new it platform that will be ready early next year and in the short term we are introducing work - arounds and mitigation measures to the old it platform to simplify the application process			0
‘ with an improved @entity51 recruitment website , streamlined medicals and an increase in the number of recruiting staff , recruits should see a much improved experience at the end of this month			0

officers *complain* about paperwork for returning ammunition to stores
@entity20 *insists* ' wasteful ' behaviour will not be tolerated
defence secretary @entity73 under pressure over it project
recruitment scheme run by @entity88 could cost another £ *50million*
