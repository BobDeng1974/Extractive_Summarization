@entity1 investigators claim to have found household appliances imported from @entity3 which contain hidden microchips that pump spam data and malware into wi - fi networks			1
authorities in @entity9 allegedly discovered 20 to 30 kettles and irons with ' spy microchips that send some data to the foreign server ' , according to @entity1 media			1
the revelation comes just as the @entity17 launches an investigation into claims that @entity1 itself bugged gifts to delegates at last month 's @entity24 summit in an attempt to retrieve data from computers and telephones			1
kitchen espionage : kettles imported to @entity1 from @entity3 with hidden microchips which can send spam data and possibly steal information have allegedly been found by authorities in @entity9 this has led to speculation that the chips allegedly found in the home appliances may also have the ability to steal data and send it back to @entity3 servers			1
the allegations against the @entity3 were made in @entity9 news outlet @entity42 , which quotes a source from customs broker @entity45 , but does not detail what data was being sent or to where			0
according to @entity50 , which translated the article , it would be possible to build a malicious microchip - sometimes referred to as a spambot or spybot - small enough to hide in a kettle			0
it also believes there are many readily available transformers which could be used to convert @entity1 's @entity59 electricty supply to power the chips without destroying them			2
but it casts doubt on the report 's claims that the devices were discovered because they were overweight as it is unlikely that the difference of a few grams would have been enough to raise suspicion			0
this might only have happened if the appliances were air - freighted , it said , which was probably not the case because they were cheap items			0

@entity99 spokesman @entity98 said that experts were looking into the handouts , which included usb sticks and were given out at the @entity103 , but said ' analysis of hardware and software have not amounted to any serious security concerns			0
' he added the investigation had not yet been fully completed			0
@entity111 newspapers reported early this week allegations that @entity1 tried to spy on participants of the @entity24 summit by giving officials free equipment like usb sticks or mobile phone chargers which , once plugged in , would infect computers with spying software			1
at the @entity24 summit on september 5 - 6 , world leaders from countries including the @entity123 , @entity3 , @entity124 and @entity125 gathered for two days of talks			2
@entity98 also said the @entity17 delegation would have been well prepared for such attempts , if true			0
