they could almost be mistaken for innocent trinkets , but these small metal stamps were used to facilitate one of history 's most appalling crimes			1
the interchangeable pieces were inserted into a special metal stamps and used by @entity9 guards to tattoo prisoners ' @entity11 numbers at the @entity14 death camp			1
but knowledge of their use could easily have been lost to time , as the @entity18 , constantly looking to streamline the business of murder , soon replaced them with a quicker and more efficient system			0
these metal stamps were used to tattoo prisoners at the @entity14 concentration camp during the early days of the holocaust before the @entity18 replaced them with a more efficient system the main gate of the @entity9 concentration camp @entity14 where the devices were used to stamp tattoos onto prisoners ' chests from 1941 before being replaced by a simpler system the loathsome devices are set to go on display at the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , where they will form part of a new collection			1
when prisoners first began to arrive at @entity14 in occupied @entity38 in 1940 they were each issued with an identification number			1
at first these numbers were stamped onto pieces of cloth which the prisoners were ordered to sew onto their clothing			0
trinkets of hate : the interchangeable pieces , which were inserted into metal stamps , were originally favoured by @entity9 guards as they allowed the tattoo to be applied in a single stroke the evil - looking devices were only used for a short period at @entity14 as they were found to be inefficient and replaced with a simpler system which used a single needle attached to a pen holder the loathsome devices are set to go on display at the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , where they will form part of a new collection but prisoners would often replace their old worn - out clothes with those of others who had died causing an unacceptable amount of confusion among the @entity72 prison guards			1
so the @entity18 decided to start using tattoos instead			0
the stamps were originally thought to be the fastest method as they allowed the number to be applied in a single stroke			1
at first , the tattoos were applied to their left breast			0
the stamp perforated the skin , and ink was rubbed into the wounds producing a tattoo			0
survivor : @entity85 , 82 , helps show the number tattooed on the chest of her husband @entity88 , 88			0
he is one of the few @entity14 survivors to have a chest tattoo			2
after the stamp system was replaced prisoners were tattooed on their arms most of the prisoners to receive tattoos at @entity14 had them placed on their arms using a single needle attached to a pen holder the first to be tattooed in this fashion were @entity102 prisoners of war who began arriving and dying by their thousands from 1941			1
the stamp system soon proved unnecessarily complex and the @entity18 replaced it with a simple needle attached to a penholder which was used to apply the tattoo to the forearm			1
it is extremely rare now for find holocaust survivors who have their @entity11 number tattoo on their chest as most of those interned in the early days of the camp 's existence did not make it to the end of the war			2
contrary to popular belief , @entity14 , which consisted of @entity14 ( @entity125 ) , @entity126 ( @entity14 ) , and @entity127 ( @entity127 and the subcamps ) was the only concentration camp where tattoos were used to identify prisoners			1
some of the 600 children , who survived the @entity14 , show their tattooed identification numbers			2
some 7,000 prisoners , were alive when the camp was liberated @entity9 officers ( @entity137 ) dr @entity138 , @entity139 , ( former commandant of @entity14 ) , @entity140 ( commandant of @entity14 ) are pictured at the @entity14 in occupied @entity38 ominously , those who did receive a tattoo on arrival at @entity14 could actually be considered lucky , for those who did not were deemed unfit for work and sent off for immediate execution			1
in the spring of 1943 , authorities adopted the practice of tattooing almost all previously registered and newly arrived prisoners , including females			0
the only exceptions were @entity72 prisoners who were held in a separate compound			0
perhaps the most notorious of all the @entity9 concentration camps , 1.1million @entity154 were killed at @entity14			2
the camp consisted of three main parts : @entity14 ( the base camp ) @entity158 ( the extermination camp ) and @entity160 ( the labour camp )			2
the train tracks at @entity14 where an estimated 1.3million , mostly @entity154 prisoners were executed during the war the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the infamous ss - 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes			2
it was run by camp commandant @entity139 who was tried and hanged in 1947 for his part in the extermination			0
the camp was liberated by the @entity174 on january 27 1945 , the day was subsequently declared @entity175			0
following its liberation the camp has become a symbol of the holocaust and has operated as a museum since 1947 .			0
