by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 08:37 est , 9 july 2013 before the rise of vast service stations and faceless coffee chains , hungry drivers relied on traditional truck stops like @entity6 and the @entity7 to refuel them on long journeys			1
once a familiar sight along the @entity12 's road network , such independent cafes have been all but wiped out by sprawling services , prompting one photographer to take to the road and document the surviving stops where motorists can enjoy a hot drink and a bacon sandwich - and still have change from £ 3.50			1
snapper @entity23 downed ' hundreds ' of cups of tea as he travelled 6,000 miles along the @entity12 's major a-routes in a bid to capture the ' open road feeling ' with his series of images of the last remaining roadside cafes			1
fuelling travellers ' journeys : independent roadside cafes - like the @entity35 on the fringes of @entity37 - are a dying breed , but a photographer has travelled the length and breadth of the country to capture the remnants of a bygone era @entity45 : traditional roadside truck stops like @entity6 in @entity47 , @entity48 , have largely been replaced by sprawling service stations ' we spend much of our lives on the road commuting , working , setting off on holiday , or just drifting , ' mr @entity23 said			1
' i wanted to capture the open road feeling , like songs such as @entity57 or the @entity58			0
' i have travelled more than 6,000 miles , used 800 litres of petrol - and i have drunk hundred of cups of tea and bacon sarnies , ' he said of his project			1
' but these independent places are under threat - several of those i photographed at the beginning of the project have since closed down			0
' historians and architectural experts echoed mr @entity23 's concern for the ' fast disappearing ' cafes			1
@entity74 , director of the @entity75 , described them as a ' unique and irreplaceable part of our heritage '			2
' they may not be attributed to named architects but they have been seen by thousands of visitors originally introducing them to new styles and materials , ' she said			0
' often it is the way that everything is designed from the building down to signage and napkins that makes them so evocative			0
' @entity91 images capture a world whose passing is happening so quietly that it is in danger of vanishing without record			0
' we can learn as much from these modest buildings as grand ones and these cafes tell a wealth of stories about how we have travelled , relaxed and sped on our way through the twentieth century , ' ms @entity74 said			2
pit stop : the sight of this burger shack is no doubt a welcome one for many a hungry motorist on @entity109 in @entity110 postcard perfect : @entity23 trekked 6,000 miles along the @entity12 's major a routes to document traditional roadside diners - including the picturesque @entity7 in @entity114 , which overlooks the coast welcome sight : @entity117 , on the @entity118 , has been refuelling motorists for more than half a century , having been established when the parents of the current owner set up a tea stop on the side of the route trucker 's salvation : rustic looking cabin the @entity128 serves food and beverages to drivers heading along the eastbound @entity132 in @entity133 no - frills : this shack - like roadside cafe is a far cry from the sprawling service stations that have sprung up along the country 's motorways in recent decades faded : traditional roadside cafes are a ' unique and irreplaceable ' part of the country 's architectural heritage , according to the @entity75 value : the photographer said he wanted his series of images to capture the ' open road feeling ' summed up by songs like @entity57 or the @entity58 @entity150 and cultural historian @entity151 said : ' before the @entity154 opened in 1959 there were no service stations and roadside variety reigned			1
' well - to - do motorists used to visit road houses - lavish hostelries that boasted swimming pools , ballrooms and even polo fields			0
' @entity163 swore by the greasy spoon transport cafes like @entity166 ’s cabin on the @entity167 and @entity168 on the @entity169			0
' then came service stations which became bland corporate spaces like roadside shopping malls , ' mr @entity151 said			1
' even the a roads , which used to be the last redoubt of the transport cafe , are now being colonised by chain owners			0
' but there are still parts of the @entity12 roadside that resist the pull of sameness and blandness			2
' when they first opened motorway service stations were stylish places where young people would would drive at high speeds to play pinball and drink @entity190 coffee			2
' but as operators began to cut costs service stations became a notorious land of un-swept floors , sticky tabletops and congealed food slowly dying under hot - lamps			2
now they have become almost like airports - clean , efficient and expensive , ' the historian added			0
' a corporate owned mono - culture now increasingly rules the roadside			0
' these images in more are seen in mr @entity23 's book , @entity206 , published by @entity207			1
roadside @entity206 : mr @entity23 travelled thousands of miles and drank ' hundreds ' of cups of tea during his efforts to document the @entity12 's last remaining roadside cafes influence : the design of ok diners like this one is inspired by the iconic roadside cafes that crop up along @entity219 's highways character : they may be small - like the @entity222 on the @entity223 in @entity224 - but @entity206 's roadside cafes boast vast car parks ideal for trucks and coaches corporate : modern service stations like the @entity232 services on the @entity154 have all but overtaken independent roadside rest stops			1

many of @entity206 's traditional truck stops have been serving up hearty fare to hungry motorists for decades
photographer @entity23 travelled more than 6,000 miles around the @entity12 snapping last remains of a bygone era
' unique ' cafes have *gradually* been replaced by bland , corporate service stations serving expensive snacks
