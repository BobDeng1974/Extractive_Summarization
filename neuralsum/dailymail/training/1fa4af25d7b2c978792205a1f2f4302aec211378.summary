it ’s been 26 years since we saw them magically tightening @entity5 ’s @entity4 boots in @entity6			0
now , self - tying shoelaces could actually become a reality this year , proving right one of the film ’s fantastical predictions for what 2015 would be like			2
engineers have designed a shoe that can automatically lace up , adjusting itself to the shape of your foot			2
the shoe company is releasing a version of the trainers ( pictured in 2015 simply slip the trainer on and pressure sensors will tell the ‘ smart shoe ’ when your foot is in position , triggering a tiny motor in the heel that pulls the laces tight			1
when you want to take off the shoes , you click your heels together twice and the motor will release a spring in the shoe ’s tongue , which loosens the laces enough for you to slip them off			1
and the ingenious invention does n’t even need to be plugged in to charge or have its battery replaced because it runs on power generated by the swing of your foot as you walk			0
engineer @entity49 , of the @entity50 in southern @entity20 , said the shoes could help a variety of different people			1
‘ one focus is that it could be used in shoes for elderly people who have mobility problems , ’ he said			0
‘ but it could also work for children , or as a lifestyle product			0
’ the design , which is still in a prototype phase , cleverly captures the energy of the foot ’s swing when opposing magnets in each shoe move past each other			1
it then uses that power to charge a battery			0
an hour of walking is enough to tighten the laces once , and it requires no energy to undo the shoes because that relies on the spring alone			1
the shoes ’ power can also be topped up by placing them on a wireless charging mat. mr @entity49 and a team from the @entity25 , who detail their design in the journal @entity86 today , are also developing a gadget that could be put in shoes to make them act as a navigation system			1
the device would use a compass , a speed calculator and a gyroscope – a device which determines orientation – to track the wearer ’s movements			2
the designers hope it could be used to help emergency services navigate around unfamiliar buildings			0
in 1989 ’s @entity103 , @entity5 wears automatically - lacing @entity26 and flies on a hoverboard when he travels forward to 2015			0
a graphic in the scientists ' paper shows how a person walking can generate energy to be used in the shoes			2

*university* of @entity25 team develops ' smart shoe ' with sensors and motor
laces tighten to different - sized feet and users click heels to take them off
an hour of walking is enough to tighten the laces once
shoes capture the energy of foot movement with magnets
@entity20 also developing *footwear* with compass and gyroscope
