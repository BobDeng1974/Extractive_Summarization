@entity0 is a small suburban town on the north shore of @entity2 , @entity3			1
the town itself was created around 1885 as somewhere to live for the workers of the @entity0 , which opened that year			1
then known as @entity8 , it was an institution that housed some of the most psychologically ill and dangerous people , with a patient census of 9,303 in 1954			1
but after closing down in 1996 , ending a 111 - year - run , the sprawling 13 - story hospital sits abandoned , towering over the tiny town			2
the ruins of @entity2 ¿ s @entity0 - which have been abandoned since 1996 - are often described as the perfect setting for a horror movie , and several have been shot there old patient beds can be seen sitting dormant at the site , which has become a mecca for trespassing , graffiti and vandalism spooky : @entity8 followed the farm colony model popular at the time , designed as a self - sufficient community where residents were put to work raising crops and livestock to support the sprawling campus			1
the labor was thought to be therapeutic throughout its history , @entity0 was notable for staying on the cutting edge of psychological science , cementing its place in history as an early adopter and proponent of a succession of new procedures and medications that eventually led to the institution ¿ s decline , such as the lobotomy the lobotomy is remembered as one of the most grotesque treatment methods of the era , in which a metal tool was inserted through the eye socket into the skull cavity , and wrenched around to sever the connections of the pre-frontal cortex from the rest of the brain today , covered in vines , the decaying hospital stands as a constant reminder to the residents of @entity0 about what their town is built around layers of colored paint peel from a hallway of isolation rooms in the first half of the 20th century , the psychological community was in a state of desperation , charged with the task of caring for a growing number of mentally ill patients with few treatment options available aside from psychotherapy and the rampant use of restraints and confinement each floor was nearly identical , with subtle variations in color and layout according to the blog @entity84 , @entity0 was known for its controversial use of psychological science , pioneering new procedures and medications throughout history , which inevitably led to the institutions decline			1
in the first half of the 20th century , the psychological community was in a state of desperation , charged with the task of caring for a growing number of mentally ill patients with few treatment options available aside from psychotherapy and the rampant use of restraints and confinement			2
once a patient was admitted to an asylum , they had no right to give or deny consent for treatment			0
the 1940s saw the rise of two groundbreaking but brutual procedures - shock therapy and the lobotomy			2
shock therapy was conceived when doctors observed that the mood of epileptic patients suffering from depression improved after a seizure , so the procedure attempted to replicate these benefits by inducing a seizure through electricity or insulin injection			2
electroconvulsive therapy , as it ’s known today , is still considered an effective treatment , even having a resurgence in recent years			0
the lobotomy is remembered as one of the most grotesque treatment methods of the era			0
it was a simple procedure , in which a metal tool was inserted through the eye socket into the skull cavity , and wrenched around to sever the connections of the pre-frontal cortex from the rest of the brain			0
it was an imprecise and brutal operation , which left lobotomized individuals with no trace of their former selves			0
the development of effective antipsychotic medication in the mid- 1950s signaled the decline of these extreme measures and the institution system as a whole			0
for the first time , residents once considered hopeless were able to manage their mental illness and live independently because of medication , leading to a dramatic shift in institutions across the country from severe overcrowding to near - abandonment			0
despite a population boom post @entity154 , by the early 1990s , the @entity0 was operating as a ghost of its former self , with many of the buildings being shut down or reduced in usage			0
eventually , the remaining patients were transferred the and the center closed in 1996			1
apart from numerous documentaries , several horror movies have been filmed at the site , including @entity165 : the legend of @entity167 in 2009 and @entity168 in 2010			0
@entity8 operated from 1885 until 1996 , when the @entity169 closed the facility , releasing its few remaining patients or transferring them to the still - operational @entity172 @entity174 , @entity0 and the other @entity2 asylums would see their patient populations soar			1
in 1954 , the patient census at @entity0 topped 9,303 , but would begin a steady decline afterwards the hospital stopped the use of controversial procedures in 1955 following the introduction of @entity183 , the first widely used medication in the treatment of mental illness old tables remain in one of the cafeteria rooms alot of furniture and equipment were left behind on the ground floor of the building for more information , visit the website of @entity197 at @entity198 .			1
