a new billboard campaign featuring images of pregnant boys has been launched in @entity3 with the intended aim of reducing teen pregnancy rates in the city			1
the @entity7 has said it choose the unusual images because it wanted to impress upon young males that teen pregnancy is not just the girl 's responsibility			1
the ad campaign has been rolled out this week in the city and suburbs , on transit buses , trains and billboards			2
a new billboard campaign featuring images of pregnant boys has been launched in @entity3 with the intended aim of reducing teen pregnancy rates in the city the ad campaign has been rolled out this week in @entity3 and suburbs , on transit buses , trains and billboards they have been placed close to local high schools where the teen pregnancy rate has recently increased , reports @entity28			1
a similar campaign ran in @entity30 last year and has been credited with helping to reduce teen pregnancy rates there			1
earlier this year a new teen pregnancy prevention ad from @entity35 's @entity34 ( @entity36 ) came under attack for using ' slut - shaming ' insults to deter unwanted pregnancy			1
the campaign , which launched on march 3 in bus shelters and subway stations , featured pictures of toddlers next to messages that read : ' honestly , @entity46 … chances are he wo n’t stay with you ' and ' i ’m twice as likely not to graduate high school because you had me as a teen			1
' a similar campaign ran in @entity30 last year and has been credited with helping to reduce teen pregnancy rates those ads were accused of using threats and ridicule to ' promote the difficulties of teen pregnancy , ' instead of offering assistance and eduction to address what the @entity36 calls ' the real costs of teen pregnancy for teens and their children			1
' @entity35 's @entity67 denounced the ads , saying they are not the answer			0
@entity70 , vice president of education and @entity72 explained : ' the latest @entity35 ad campaign creates stigma , hostility , and negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people			1
' @entity82 ’s money would be better spent helping teens access health care , birth control , and high - quality sexual and reproductive health education , not on an ad campaign intended to create shock value ' an interactive component to the campaign also offered young people the choice to ' @entity93 " to 877877 for the real cost of teen pregnancy			1
' helpful or harmful ? a new @entity96 ad campaign from @entity35 's @entity34 has come under attack for using ' slut - shaming ' insults to deter unwanted pregnancy once teens texted the number , they are faced with ' sobering facts about teen pregnancy , ' according to the campaign 's press release			1
different scenarios depicted how a teen mother would gain an excessive amount of weight , be ignored by the child 's father , and shunned by her parents			2
however the texts offer no information on how to avoid a pregnancy			2
' the ad creates stigma , hostility , and negative public opinions ... rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people ' one text message received by @entity125 came from a hypothetical 16 - year - old teen named @entity127 , who wrote : ' @entity128 ! my @entity129 and i got pregnant			1
he was going to take me to prom , now i will look huge in my dress			0
should i go ? ' after responding ' yes , ' @entity127 replied : ' my bff called me a " fat loser " at prom			0
' a later message added : ' ugh , now i have morning sickness during an exam ! should i throw up or finish the test ? ' the ads were accused of being judgmental and problematic , resulting in emotional anxiety and stress , rather than creating a productive discourse surrounding teen pregnancy			1
@entity147 's @entity146 called the campaign a ' shortsighted outreach ' that will ' create a deeper chasm between the people who want assistance , and the organizations that are ostensibly offering it			2
' insulting or informative ? the campaign , which launched on march 3rd in @entity35 bus shelters and subway stations , features pictures of toddlers next to messages that have been accused of being ' hostile ' polarizing public opinion : the ads , which aim to ' promote the difficulties of teen pregnancy , ' are being accused of using threats and ridicule instead of offering assistance and eduction to address teen pregnancy she wrote : ' way to attempt to make every teen mom / person with a teen mom feel like utter s * * t when they ride the subway , @entity35 ! ' shaming people is n't a pregnancy prevention tool			1
education , assistance , and condoms are , but misguided subway ads are n't			0
there are so many wonderful teen moms , and this is basically a middle finger to them			2
' think of how it must feel for the child of a teen mom who sees this poster			0
what message does that send them ? " @entity195 drop out now , because you 're doomed to fail , " ' she added			0
the @entity36 told @entity125 that the purpose of the campaign is to highlight the challenges facing teen parents - hurdles such as raising a child before they are emotionally ready or financially secure			2
' many teens may not be aware that having a child before they finish school and get married means both that they are more likely to live in poverty , and that their children will be less likely to graduate from high school and avoid poverty in their own lives , ' @entity36 explained			0
' eight in 10 teen parents do not marry each other in the first year , and the parent without custody ( usually the father ) is required to pay child support until the child is 21			2
' the backbone of the campaign may use factual messages to deliver a ' wake - up call ' , but the strong messages already appear to have backfired			0
waste of money ? @entity35 's @entity67 said : ' the latest campaign creates ... negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people ' one @entity147 commenter wrote : ' speaking as the child of a teen mom , i can also say there 's already a pretty awful sense of guilt that hits you when you realize that you were unplanned and your birth completely altered your mother 's life ( and more often than not , negatively affected the quality of her life )			1
pretty crummy on a couple levels here			0
' there are also many successful single teen parents who raise brilliant children , a fact not lost on their children			0
one commenter , who called the campaign a ' slut - shaming pile of garbage ' explained : ' my mum was 17 years old when she had me and i am extremely proud of how we both turned out			0
' she may have been young and inexperienced , but the trade off was having a mum who had tons of energy , who was open minded , who gave me a fantastic education in pop culture ... i could talk to her about things that no one else i knew could mention to their parents			0
' she continued : ' i would never recommend that someone chooses to be a teenaged mum - but i am who i am because of of my mother , and her age was a part of who she was when i was growing up			0
' after mayor @entity276 and commissioner @entity275 unveiled the campaign , mr @entity275 explained in a statement : ' teens giving birth before they are ready to provide emotional and financial support is not a good way to raise children			0
' we can not dictate how people live their lives , and sometimes even the best plans do n’t work out , but we must encourage responsibility and send the right message , especially to young people			0
