@entity1 coach @entity0 has urged @entity2 and the @entity3 to take the threat of the ebola virus seriously with the @entity6 just three months away			1
the spread of the disease , which has killed more than 4,000 people across @entity10 , has put the tournament in doubt , with the host nation @entity14 requesting the finals be moved or postponed			2
@entity3 refused the request and a series of qualifiers took place across the continent over the past week , with @entity1 striker @entity21 scoring twice in @entity23 's 2 - 0 win over @entity24 last saturday			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 is adamant that the ebola virus outbreak must be taken seriously @entity0 , though , insists that the priority must be people 's safety , and not whether football matches go ahead			1
' i do n't know whether the players think about it [ @entity33 ] , but i think a lot about it , ' the @entity1 boss was quoted as saying on @entity37			2
' i spoke a lot with ' @entity39 ' [ @entity40 ] about it , tried to sensitise him of the problem as he was away with his national team			0
@entity21 , who scored against @entity44 last month , played for @entity23 in @entity45 on saturday @entity0 said he spoke in depth to the striker about the threat of the @entity33 outbreak before he flew to @entity10 ' young people are green ; they do n't think that much about such things			1
' i do n't really understand how @entity2 or whoever is responsible for that can assume that of all things the borders in @entity10 are safe enough that no @entity33 - infected person can travel to another country			2
even here [ in @entity60 ] , we are n't able to do that			0
' if there is one country in @entity10 which has the feeling that it ca n't host the @entity6 safely then this has to be the priority , not the tournament			0
' you have to take this seriously and ca n't shut your eyes			0
there will be a lot people from all over @entity10 in @entity14 to watch the games and only a few of them would have undergone the best medical checks			0
