@entity1 's brother @entity0 has noticed how the @entity3 manager is subconsciously picking up some of the mannerisms of their legendary dad @entity5			1
and certainly @entity5 would have been impressed with his son 's cup record with the @entity10 club – 13 wins in 16 ties after taking another @entity14 scalp @entity15 on tuesday night			1
@entity16 famously won the league championship with @entity18 and @entity19 , and his cup record was n't too bad either			1
@entity1 ( left ) argues with counterpart @entity21 during @entity3 's win against @entity15 @entity23 gestures towards his players during a @entity26 match in 1990 @entity3 's @entity28 striker @entity27 celebrates after putting his side 1 - 0 up @entity27 ( centre ) pounces to score the winner as @entity15 goalkeeper @entity32 looks on played 16 , won 13 , drawn 2 , lost 1 he won the @entity35 and @entity36 twice each with @entity19 – @entity1 played in both @entity36 triumphs – although ' @entity23 ' never lifted the @entity38 despite reaching the final in 1991			1
some of that knockout magic has clearly rubbed off on @entity41 earlier this year he took @entity43 blades to the @entity38 semi-final , defeating @entity14 @entity45 and @entity46 on the way before losing 5 - 3 to @entity48 in a thriller at @entity50			2
this season they beat @entity52 on penalties at @entity54 and a @entity27 goal was enough to beat the @entity14 's fifth - place side @entity15 , whose manager was so upset with @entity1 's animated presence on the touchline , he refused to shake hands with him afterwards			1
the @entity42 boss ( centre ) holds out his arms as @entity21 refuses to shake hands @entity3 manager @entity1 and coach @entity67 ( left ) have a word with referee @entity69 certainly , @entity70 does n't adhere to his father 's rule of never criticising or berating officials			1
but he would be proud to see the way his son , who he fetchingly referred to as ' our no 9 ' at @entity19 , can maximise the talents of his players			0
@entity5 signed a striker called @entity81 for £ 2,000 from @entity82 and used him to win the @entity35			2
@entity1 signed a striker called @entity84 from @entity85 and gave him his debut against @entity15 as a half - time substitute			2
@entity5 transformed @entity89 ' career by converting him from centre - forward to centre - half , @entity1 played right - winger @entity92 at right - back against @entity15 to cope with injuries and the loss of cup - tied players , and it worked			1
@entity1 believed that if a player was good enough he was old enough			0
@entity1 had no hesitation in starting with 17 - year - old @entity100 on tuesday and he did n't look out of place against established @entity14 players @entity103 and @entity104			2
@entity1 had no hesitation in starting with 17 - year - old @entity100 ( centre ) against @entity15 the @entity42 players celebrate beating @entity52 on penalties in the @entity36 second round @entity5 would have been impressed with his son 's cup record with the @entity10 club – 13 wins in 16 ties @entity70 celebrates a @entity116 goal during @entity3 's 5 - 3 @entity38 semi-final defeat against @entity48 last season @entity119 won the @entity35 and @entity36 twice each with @entity19 @entity10 was bouncing with the @entity121 effect – a sop to any club that does n't take domestic cup competitions seriously			1
' it was a remarkable effort by the players , and the supporters too , ' said @entity1			0
' we try to go for it in every game			0
' nights like this are special			0
i was talking to ( @entity15 coach ) @entity136 , he knows as a former @entity138 player that you do n't want to come to a place like this when everything is buzzing			0
@entity5 would have been proud			0
just cut out the backchat to the officials !			0
