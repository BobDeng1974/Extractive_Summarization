by @entity1 reporter warm temperatures and showers have made it a record year for slugs as the weather has provided the perfect breeding conditions the hot weather is n’t just encouraging gardeners to get stuck into the veg patch			1
warm temperatures coupled with regular showers have provided slugs with perfect breeding conditions , meaning record numbers – estimated to be double last year ’s count – are descending on our well - tended borders			1
and the weather has been good for plants too , meaning the pests have rich pickings			0
as well as the recent humidity , the mild winter further boosted the slug population because there were fewer frosts to destroy their eggs			1
@entity28 of @entity29 advised : ‘ it is much better to water in the morning			0
that allows water to evaporate away before the slugs are active			2
the worst time to water is at night			0
’ another research team , examining new ' monster slugs ' , claim that an army of outsized gastropods have also hit the country			2
the pests , which feast on dead matter and dog excrement , are said to be particularly hardy and able to devour up to 20 slug pellets before they even start to show the effects			2
dr @entity48 , head of entomology at the @entity50 in @entity51 , first encountered the slugs in @entity53 in 2012			2
he counted 350 of them in just one day and when he saw some eating a dead mouse he decided to send samples for identification			0
researchers received a number of sightings of the beasts in april last year , but a sudden cold snap either killed many off or slowed down their breeding			1
however , it is feared that the current warm period is set to spark a breeding frenzy of the monsters			0
dr @entity48 said : ' with the mild winter climate and the conditions we have seen in the spring , we are expecting them to make a comeback this year			1
' i am starting to find a few dozen in the garden already			0
' as well as the recent humidity , the mild winter further boosted the slug population because there were fewer frosts to destroy their eggs the scientist and his team of researchers are seeking to secure funding for urgent research , so as to tackle the monster molluscs before they destroy many crops			1
these slugs , which are cannibalistic and eat others of their kind , are thought to have first arrived in @entity94 on imported lettuce and other salad leaves			1
experts fear they will breed with native species - which play a vital role in our ecosystem - to create a mutant version that could resist all forms of pest control			0
dr @entity48 warned : ' the @entity106 slug is a voracious predator that can survive eating many of the slug pellets that are supposed to kill them			0
' the warm , wet , summer has also lead to an increase in other insects , including flying ants			0
professor @entity113 added : ' it seems to have been a very good year for them , we ’re doing a study into flying ants and numbers seem to be high			2
' it ’s not easy to tell half - way through the season , but this seems to be a similar summer to last year and that was a good year for the flying ants , their numbers were up			1

temperatures have provided slugs with the perfect breeding conditions
slug population is in record numbers in the @entity94 this year - double last year
creatures further boosted by mild winter , where fewer of their eggs were destroyed
