by @entity0 covered in graffiti and with every window smashed , this is the crumbling @entity4 village in the @entity5 that was abandoned two decades ago at the end of the @entity8			1
eerily quiet today , it once bustled with hundreds of residents but all the workers and their families went back home to @entity4 after the @entity14 came down			2
named @entity16 , which is @entity5 for @entity17 , the village was built after @entity19 forces invaded what was then @entity21 in 1968			1
there were once hundreds of residents but they went home to @entity4 after the @entity14 came down @entity8 hangover : until the town was abandoned two decades ago , @entity16 in the old @entity21 used to be heavily guarded because it housed a top secret @entity19 military base thousands lived in the pale grey communist - style apartment blocks and nearby military barracks , and the village had its own cinema , powerplant and farmland			1
before the @entity4 abandoned @entity16 and a military airfield next door in 1991 , the residents were mostly isolated from the @entity5 in the nearby village of @entity44 , which lies across the countryside on the other side of the airfield			1
the village used to be heavily guarded because it was part of a top - secret @entity19 military base rumoured to house nuclear warheads , but today there are only warning signs and flimsy pieces of plastic tape to discourage visitors from entering			1
barely visible from the main road , @entity16 , which is about 30 miles north east of @entity58 , now mainly attracts graffiti artists , vandals and the occasional curious tourist			2
many buildings have become concrete shells , with broken glass , rusting oil barrels and smashed - up desks littering the floors			1
one or two have been torched by local tearaways			0
but the village does still offer up reminders of its long - departed residents			0
@entity73 beds can be found in a few of the flats , while pieces of old lavatory cisterns litter the floor in the hallways			0
wasteland : named @entity16 , which is @entity5 for @entity17 , the village was built after @entity19 forces invaded what was then @entity21 in 1968			1
just over two decades later it was abandoned eerie : barely visible from the main road , @entity16 , which is about 30 miles north east of @entity58 , now mainly attracts graffiti artists , vandals and the occasional curious tourist abandoned : many buildings have become concrete shells , with broken glass , rusting oil barrels and smashed - up desks littering the floors			1
one or two have been torched by local tearaways underneath the wallpaper in most of the empty apartments , the walls are plastered with mid 1970s @entity4 newspapers , among them the @entity101 mouthpiece , @entity102			2
many show pictures of soldiers , tanks and military manoeuvres on the front page , the papers trying to drum up patriotic enthusiasm among the masses			0
pictures of the late former @entity19 leader @entity112 , who ran the @entity19 until he died in 1982 , can be seen around the area			0
some floors have a floral pattern to them , a rare decorative touch in an otherwise austere communist development			0
the village serves as a reminder of a chapter of history that still arouses anger among @entity5 because it is tied in with their country 's loss of sovereignty			0
@entity21 had been communist since 1948 , but in the late 1960s it became more liberal			0
@entity19 armed forces invaded and occupied the country because they were concerned about the country 's drift away from the @entity132			2
@entity16 was built up as one of the @entity19 ' main military bases in the country , staffed by @entity4 personnel			1
artistic graffiti : this graffiti offers a rare decorative touch to the dour @entity19 architecture of the @entity142 village that was built in the late 1960s @entity19 satellite village : before the @entity4 abandoned @entity16 and a military airfield next door in 1991 , the residents were mostly isolated from the @entity5 in the nearby village of @entity44 @entity19 newspapers : the walls of this grim apartment are he walls are plastered with mid 1970s @entity4 newspapers , among them the @entity101 mouthpiece , @entity102 when @entity156 introduced his glasnost reforms after becoming @entity19 leader in 1985 , democratic movements developed across @entity155 , led in @entity21 by the playwright @entity159			1
in 1989 , the country 's ' @entity160 ' saw it break free of @entity19 control and in subsequent years , with @entity159 now president , the occupying military forces headed home			2
in 1992 , after the @entity19 forces had left , @entity16 was handed back to the authorities in @entity21 , which a year later split from @entity168 to become the @entity5			1
with little industry in the quiet countryside nearby , and with the land in and around the village said to be contaminated , major developers were not interested in the area , and the village has been left to its fate			2
desolate : wallpaper can be seen peeling off the walls of this wreck of an apartment			0
behind it , the walls are lined with 1970s @entity19 newspapers graffiti : cut off from nearby towns inhabited by the @entity5 , @entity16 was almost completely abandoned when the @entity19 left at the end of the @entity8 peeling : the wreck of a property in @entity16 , a crumbling @entity4 village in the @entity5 that was abandoned two decades ago at the end of the @entity8 @entity19 past : a close - up of the old @entity4 newspaper , from 1974 , which lines the walls of the old @entity19 apartment block in @entity16 newsprint : another old newspaper from 1974 in the abandoned apartment in @entity5			1
in @entity16 there are today only warning signs and flimsy pieces of plastic tape discouraging visitors from entering plans to use the adjacent airport as a cargo hub never got off the ground and instead , the airfield is now used by small hobby aircraft that enthusiasts fly mostly at weekends			1
workmen use the open spaces of the village as dumping grounds for tree trunks and branches cleared from the area			0
next door to @entity16 , and fenced off from the former @entity4 village , are a handful of apartment blocks			1
although a few residents walk their dogs in the ghost village , many regard it as an eyesore and a hazard			0
much of the live ammunition said to have been left behind by the @entity4 has been disposed of by the @entity5 authorities			0
however , the vandalized apartments , with their balcony and staircase railings removed , along with anything else remotely valuable , are potential deathtraps , particularly for unwary children			0
@entity236 , 32 , a car industry project manager who lives in one of the blocks next to @entity16 , described the abandoned village as ' creepy '			2
' it could be dangerous for children because they are curious			0
it would be better if they were n't there , these big buildings , but i do n't know who 's in charge of it all , ' he said			0
rather than knock the buildings down , all the authorities have done as a safety measure is to drape netting over the top storey of each of the blocks of flats			0
so for the foreseeable future , @entity16 looks set to remain as a chilling reminder of @entity8 tensions			0
derelict : many buildings have become concrete shells , with broken glass , rusting oil barrels and smashed - up desks littering the floors			2
one or two have been torched by local tearaways empty apartment blocks : hundreds of @entity4 lived in apartment buildings like these in @entity16 until the whole area was abandoned at the end of the @entity8 @entity274 : only graffiti brightens up these angular off - white apartment blocks in @entity16 , designed in classic imposing @entity19 style			1
they now lie completely empty - and tape warns people not to approach no interest : with little industry in the quiet countryside nearby , and with the land in and around the village said to be contaminated , major developers were not interested in the area , and the village has been left to its fate overgrown : @entity16 , a crumbling @entity4 village in the @entity5 that was abandoned two decades ago at the end of the @entity8 @entity274 : vandalised apartments , with their balcony and staircase railings removed , along with anything else remotely valuable , are potential deathtraps , particularly for unwary children ' @entity297 ' ? : named @entity16 , which is @entity5 for @entity17 , the village was built after @entity19 forces invaded what was then @entity21 in 1968 wasteland : graffiti adorns another wall inside one of the apartment blocks in the abandoned @entity19 village inside the @entity5 @entity19 secrets : the area was closely guarded during the @entity8 because it was part of a top - secret military base rumoured to house nuclear warheads anti-war graffiti : a picture of a tank with the words ' stop war ' above it is daubed on a wall in the crumbling @entity4 village of @entity16 which once housed a @entity19 military base wreckage : the village has been left to its fate , with no @entity5 interested in redeveloping the area that remains as a symbol of the country 's @entity8 past shattered glass : the bleak view out the window of an upstairs apartment block which has shattered glass			1

@entity16 which was home to thousands of @entity4 was built after @entity19 forces invaded @entity21 in 1968
