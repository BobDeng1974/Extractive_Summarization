he 's single and he 's looking for love			0
but , to win his heart , you 'd have to accept his rather unconventional lifestyle			0
@entity5 has not washed for 60 years , because he believes being clean will make him sick , and his favourite food is rotten porcupine			1
mr @entity5 , 80 , says he chose this way of life after going through some emotional setbacks in his youth and since then - perhaps unsurprisingly - he has become a bit isolated			1
his home is in @entity21 village in the southern province of @entity23 in @entity24 where , once , a group of young men offered to give him a shower - but luckily he managed to escape			1
