by @entity0 conservationists have launched a fresh attack on the killing of sharks cull off @entity5 after a tiger shark was shot three times and took 15 minutes to die			1
according to environmental group @entity9 , the three - metre long creature was caught about 1km off @entity10 , north of @entity11 , on monday			2
a hook pierced its head and the creature sustained further injuries as it thrashed around and tried to free itself			0
following this , three fatal shots were then fired into the shark 's head before it was hauled onto the boat and then later dumped out to sea			2
@entity37 managing director @entity36 said it took the shark up to 15 minutes to die			2
' the reason they killed it its part of the fisheries ' policy that any shark more than thee metres will be killed , ' he said of the cull 's conditions			1
' we wo n't accept the @entity52 whaling fleets doing that			2
they 're ( the fisheries ) killing a protecting species			0
' mr @entity36 alleged the @entity57 authorities have used tactics such as running the @entity9 's boats out of fuel and dumping sharks in exclusion zones to prevent them seeing the full extent of the cull			1
the drum line program was introduced in january after seven fatal shark attacks in @entity5 waters in the last three years @entity9 crew member @entity68 he struggled to comprehend the treatment of the shark			1
' i have now seen first hand the barbaric , senseless , cruel and tragedy of the @entity5 shark cull , ' he said			1
drum lines : the animal shot dead was found 1km off @entity10 , north of @entity11 , in an attempt to stop attacks on humans ' i have seen today a beautiful female 3m plus tiger shark in such a stressed state , thrashing around for her life , before being pulled alongside and shot three times			1
mr @entity68 said it was likely the shark was pregnant at its time of death , given the time of year			0
' i have just returned from defending the whales in the @entity93 @entity92 whale sanctuary and can not believe what i am seeing right off our @entity5 coast , it rivals that of any cruelty and insanity of the @entity52 whale poachers			1
a @entity102 spokesperson said as of march 16 , 110 tiger sharks had been killed			1
' it 's not an unusual occurrence , ' he said of killing the shark and added that the rifles used were the most humane way of doing so			0
the spokesman confirmed sharks under three metres are released alive as soon as possible , while those more than three metres of the bull , tiger or white species are killed humanely after being caught			1
' sharks under three metres are released if they are alive and ok			2
but we do pull up some dead sharks , ' he said			0
with sharks being killed daily as part of the cull , the spokesman said the aim was to make beaches safer			1
earlier on monday , the non-profit conservation organisation saw an injured 2.7m tiger shark caught on a drum line 1km off @entity126 , north of @entity11 , be released by @entity127 , despite its injuries			1
with the animal believed to have been hooked during the night , the fisheries officers inspected the caught animal			2
despite the animal 's wounds , after pulling the shark on board , it was released into the water near its original capture still bleeding			2
@entity9 captain @entity140 said with the possibility of the shark being hooked over night , it would have been unable to swim and get vital oxygen to its organs			0
this causes the animal to go into a tonic state of immobility			0
tiger shark : the animal can grow up to 5 metres and is regarded as one of the most dangerous species of shark - making up a large number of the attacks on humans mr @entity140 said the contrary to the cull protecting the public from sharks , it was doing the opposite			1
' it makes public safety worse with sharks being drawn closer to our beaches stimulated by bait , ' he said			0
mr @entity36 said despite the shark 's release , it could have died or been attacked by other animals			0
' we do n't know - it 's hard to say , ' he said			0
' it really was n't in a good state			0
' both of the the incidents were caught on video by the @entity9 organisation , watching from a nearby boat			0
mr @entity36 said the cull was not about sharks being more important that humans , but wanted to see alternatives used to killing the animals			1
' healthy oceans give humanity oxygen and oceans need sharks , ' he said			0
mr @entity36 added in a time of animal conservation including sharks , the @entity191 government was using 1950s solutions for the issue			0
he cited the protection of the great white shark , which is also being killed as part of the government 's cull			1
alternatives include eco-barriers and relying on a shark spotters program , where surfers and swimmers collect data on sharks to asses the level of shark danger			0
the @entity211 approved the cull , which ends in three years , but the @entity5 government is seeking to extending these until 2019			2
@entity37 aims to stop the destruction of habitat and killing of ocean wildlife and recently failed to secure a @entity219 injunction to force the @entity5 government to suspend the cull			1
the trial of the cull runs until april 30 .			0

@entity37 members have witnessed brutal treatment of tiger sharks caught in drum lines
as part of a cull to prevent attacks on humans , the animals were caught in lines off the @entity5 coast
one shark was caught and reportedly killed after being shot three times in the head
hours earlier authorities released another shark from a line despite it being in poor condition and bleeding heavily
members of the conservation group have likened the fisheries ' treatment of sharks to @entity52 poachers
