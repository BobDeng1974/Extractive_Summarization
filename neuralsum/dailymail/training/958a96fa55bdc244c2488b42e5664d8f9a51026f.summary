by @entity0 it might only take a minute , two at most			0
but that wait for the water to boil when you 're desperate for your morning tea can seem like an eternity			2
but now a revolutionary new kettle that hooks up to your wifi could put an end to the agony - and shave minutes off your daily routine			0
the @entity14 can be switched on remotely over the internet using a smartphone , meaning you can get your tea on the go from anywhere in your house - and yes , that includes bed			1
futuristic : the @entity14 can be switched on remotely using a smartphone app - and will even wake you up to ask you if you would like it switched on there will be no more dashing out during x factor ad breaks and hopping from foot to foot while the thing slowly boils either			1
the kettle can be switched on from your phone before the ad breaks happen - and then set to be kept warm until you 're ready to use the water			1
the 1.8 litre kettle , dubbed the ' steaming servant ' on @entity37 where it went on sale this morning , has some decent new technology in there too			0
thanks to our growing fondness for hippy teas , the kettle has been created with a selection of different temperatures , designed to suit specific drinks			0
control : the kettle can be set to boil at a variety of different temperatures depending on the drink required			2
green tea is best at 80f , coffee at 95f according to hot beverage boffins , different drinks are best served at specific temperatures - green tea at 80 degrees ; coffee at 95 , for example - and you can pre-set the kettle to heat the water to the appropriate level			1
but the question that leaps to mind is whether this futuristic contraption could potentially be switched on from afar without the user realising it is empty			0
the answer to that , say @entity14 's manufacturers , is no. they say that the kettle has an auto - shut off function and boil - dry protection , and wo n't heat up unless there 's enough water for it to do so safely			2
now if only it could make the tea and bring it up to us too , our lives really would be complete			0
design features : the kettle has a soft - touch handle and transparent lid so you can see how much water is in the jug hi - tech : the app will wake you up with a morning message or welcome you home with a missive asking if you 'd like the kettle boiled			1
