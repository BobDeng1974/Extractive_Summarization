by @entity0 published : 01:43 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 8 january 2013 getting enough sleep will be one of the biggest challenges facing the first astronauts travelling the 47million miles to @entity5			1
poor sleep was a key problem encountered by six volunteers during a 17 - month simulated round trip to the @entity10			1
the men - three @entity12 , an @entity13 , a @entity14 and a @entity16 man - spent 520 days and nights confined to a 550 cubic metre ' spacecraft ' and cut off from the outside world			1
the men were kept isolated and did not have access to natural light or fresh air			0
for one month of the project , funded by @entity12 and @entity41 space agencies , they were able to explore another enclosed area that represented the surface of @entity5			0
as the mission progressed , crew members became more sedentary and most experienced sleep disturbances , the data revealed			1
without normal sleep - wake activity cycles , their ' body clock ' , or circadian rhythm , patterns became disrupted			2
the mock spaceship made most of the volunteers lethargic and sleepy			2
four of the men had considerable trouble sleeping and some had depression issues			2
only one man 's sleep was mostly unaffected during the ' trip ' , according to the findings published in the journal @entity62			1
the team aboard the fake mars mission celebrating @entity65 the team celebrating @entity67 onboard their simulated spacecraft they emerged one by one after their 520 day ' mission ' and the first results show sleep deprivation was the biggest issue the tired looking team moments after they were released from the simulator previous simulated missions have even included simulated ' @entity5 walks ' supposed to replicate excursions onto the surface of @entity5			1
one of the six volunteers - who were paid about Â£ 62,000 - slept nearly half an hour less each night than he did when he started the mission , affecting how he went about his day			2
co-author professor @entity83 , from the @entity85 's @entity84 , said : ' a take - away message from this line of research is the life - sustaining importance that healthy sleep duration and timing plays for everyone			0
' as a global society , we need to re-evaluate how we view sleep as it relates to our overall health and ability to lead productive lives			0
@entity100 landed the @entity101 on @entity5 last year which has sent back information to give scientists a better picture of the planet ' whether it is an astronaut being challenged to reach another planet or a newborn baby just learning to walk , the human body 's need for sleep is as essential as our need for food and water and integral to our ability to thrive			1
' the scientists found that to make any long space mission a success they would need to mimic night and day cycles on @entity120			1
this will mean paying attention to timed light exposure , food intake and exercise			0
sleep expert dr @entity126 , from the @entity85 in the @entity127 and a member of the research team , said the study revealed the ' need to ensure maintenance of the @entity120 's natural circadian rhythm , sleep quantity and quality , and optimal activity levels during exploration missions '			0
last year @entity137 announced @entity100 would aim to reach an asteroid by 2020 and after that send astronauts to @entity5			0
mr @entity137 announced that @entity100 would aim to reach an asteroid by 2020 and after that send astronauts to @entity5			0
the world record for continuous time in space - 14 months - is held by dr. @entity144 , who was on the @entity12 space station @entity146 in 1994 and 1995			0
@entity127 astronaut @entity147 and @entity12 cosmonaut @entity148 are scheduled to spend a year in space on the @entity150 , starting in 2015			0
before ' landing ' the team used blue lights so their eyes readjusted to daylight scientists say they would need to overcome the challenge of sleep deprivation on any manned mission to @entity5			1

six volunteers spent 17 months confined in a 550 cubic metre ' spacecraft '
scientists found all but one had sleep pattern issues on the simulated trip
the crew became more sedentary during the @entity23 *experiment*
