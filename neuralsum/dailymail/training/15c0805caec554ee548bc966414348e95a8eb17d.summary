by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 03:20 est , 15 january 2013 a controlling former police detective has today been jailed for life for the brutal , pre-planned murder of his estranged wife at her high street hair salon			1
a judge said @entity7 must serve a minimum term of 28 years before he is considered for release after the ' frenzied ' attack which killed his wife @entity11 , 33 in @entity12 , @entity13 last year			1
the trial had heard @entity7 had made repeated threats to kill mrs @entity16 in the months before her murder , once telling her : ' you are a walking dead woman ... tick - tock , tick - tock '			1
life : bullying former detective @entity7 , left , must serve at least 28 years for the murder of his estranged wife , @entity11 , right evil : @entity7 pictured buying the knife he used to kill his wife in a @entity27 just minutes before the attack after finding out @entity11 had started a relationship with a new boyfriend @entity30 , 34 , he even strangled her so hard she fell unconscious			1
@entity7 eventually fulfilled his threats when he burst into @entity33 and beauty salon in @entity12 , @entity13 , on april 30 last year and stabbed @entity11 up to 11 times in front of her terrified 17 - year - old employee and close friend , @entity38			1
the attack was so ferocious the blade of the knife he had bought just minutes earlier in @entity27 ’s bent and the tip snapped off			0
there were cheers and clapping from the public gallery today at @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity13 as the sentence was passed			2
@entity7 , wearing a grey suit , white shirt and black tie , showed no emotion as he was sent to prison			2
judge @entity55 , sentencing @entity7 , told him : ' you cut down and killed a young woman who was in her prime			1
she was clearly much loved by many , well liked by many more and who had a huge amount to offer this world			0
' not only did you take her precious life but in doing so , you devastated the lives of so many around her			0
scene of the attack : mrs @entity16 was knifed to death at her high street hair salon in @entity12 , @entity13 , ( left )			1
judge @entity55 , right , described the killing as ' planned to the minute ' ' you had previously made her life a misery , subjecting her to extreme physical and verbal abuse			1
' you sent her evil text messages , you threatened her and others in telephone calls , you tried to strangle her on one occasion and you had previously threatened her with a knife ' and yet she never offered you any malice of any sort			0
' he added : ' she decided after considerable thought and with every justification that she had to leave you			0
you are a controlling man and the only way you could continue to control her life was to take it from her			0
' having threatened to do so the previous day you purchased a knife and walked calmly through the streets of @entity12			2
you were determined quite plainly from your body language on that cctv in your quest and you had only one thing on your mind and that was her murder			0
' and you had no other intention that day i ’m quite satisfied with that other than to kill her			0
this was a calculated , pre-meditated killing planned to the minute			0
' having established she was there by looking through the window at the back of the shop , you entered			0
' the shop was open to the public and it was a place where she was entitled to feel safe			0
you stabbed her repeatedly with frenzied blows and with such force that one of those blows penetrated her shoulder blade and you did that in front of a 17 - year - old girl who was her friend and colleague			2
' you then walked calmly back to your car drove home and waited for arrest			0
you offered no help , you have showed no remorse			0
even when interviewed that day , you displayed a degree of arrogance			0
but no sorrow and no appropriate emotion			0
' in mitigation , defence counsel @entity130 said of @entity16 : ' he has unquestionably a lack of empathy and that surely must have played a part , if not in the killing itself , but in the way it was carried out and his conduct thereafter			2
' bloodied : this image shows the knife used by @entity7 to attack his wife			1
the 8 - inch blade bent and the tip broke off under the ferocity of the attack weapon : the packaging and receipt for the knife which @entity7 bought from @entity27 's after @entity7 ’s conviction on friday , questions were raised about whether police had missed opportunities to protect mrs @entity16			1
it emerged that she had spoken to police four times about the abusive former policeman , from 2009 to just a month before she was murdered			1
according to police , mrs @entity16 was unwilling to support a prosecution , and failed to return phone calls and attend meetings because she did not want to harm his prospects			1
no referral was made to the police watchdog , the @entity165 , about the previous contact between the force and mrs @entity16 and no disciplinary issues were found			1
the case is now the subject of an independently chaired , multi-agency review which will report next month			1
defending the police ’s response , detective chief inspector @entity174 , of the @entity13 and @entity175 , said on friday : ' i ’m not sure they were missed opportunities			2
' even though we do n’t necessarily need the victim of domestic abuse , we can look for other evidence and we do on a daily basis			2
@entity11 consciously did n’t want to harm @entity7 ’s future			2
' outside court on friday , mrs @entity16 ’s father , @entity185 , told reporters : ' what can i say ? justice has been done			1
we are very happy with the result			0
' in a statement , miss @entity38 called mrs @entity16 ' my closest best friend '			1
she added : ' the world has lost a woman who was n’t just beautiful on the outside but a special , caring person who ’d help anyone she could			0
