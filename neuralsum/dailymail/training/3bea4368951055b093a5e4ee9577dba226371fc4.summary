there ’s a lethal weapon in my hand			2
it might look to you like a bottle of beer			1
but this one could knock you dead			2
called ‘ @entity8 ’ — the name is no accident — it is the strongest beer in the world			1
at 65 per cent alcohol , it ’s stronger than whisky or brandy and 16 times more potent than a standard pub lager			1
this 330ml bottle contains 22 units of alcohol — the equivalent of ten pints of @entity21			1
not for the faint - hearted : @entity22 pours @entity23 a glass of the world 's strongest beer , @entity8 , at the @entity28 site in @entity29 and , like that other famous novelty , the deep - fried @entity32 ( which has just celebrated 20 years since its creation ) , it ’s a gift to the world from the good people of @entity38			1
though ‘ gift ’ is probably not the right word : if you buy this in a shop , it ’ll cost £ 80 a bottle ( though you can buy it for half that price direct from the brewery )			1
‘ go on , take a mouthful , ’ says brewer @entity22 , the young entrepreneur responsible for the brew			2
‘ i think you ’ll be surprised			2
’ ok , but i ’m not looking forward to it			2
i ’m a bit of a sissy when it comes to strong booze			2
though i love my beer and wine , i steer clear of neat spirits , finding their fiery nature rather off - putting			1
surely , if @entity62 is a mere 40 per cent alcohol , and this beer weighs in at 65 per cent , it ’ll rip off the back of my throat ? i swirl the liquid round			1
thicker than an average pint of bitter , and darker in tone , the beer is the colour of tea with the consistency of a thinnish gravy			2
is this a good idea ? @entity23 appears a little apprehensive as he prepares to drink the strong beer i take a big , brave gulp			2
to my surprise , it ’s rather smooth			0
there ’s none of the heat or the harshness of neat tequila or vodka ; it slips over my tongue and down my throat , lining my mouth with a thick coating			0
yes , it is quite bitter — i prefer a milder - tasting ale — but it ’s not off the scale			1
there ’s a definite maltiness and a rather pleasant sweet aftertaste at the centre and back of my tongue			0
i ’m happy to take a second sip			0
just curiosity , you understand			0
and a third , and a fourth			0
i could , i ’m sure , empty the glass			0
i think i ’d better stop while i ’m ahead			0
so , i ask @entity22 , why did he decide to brew a beer so potent ? is it something to do with the fact that the @entity38 consume 20 per cent more alcohol ( 22.8 units a week ) than the @entity109 and @entity110 ? drink up : @entity23 takes a sip as young entrepreneur @entity22 watches on the idea was simple , he says			1
his young company @entity28 , set in the @entity29 countryside , had successfully created conventional beers — a tasty 4 per cent pale ale , for example — but wanted to try something more adventurous			1
@entity22 is not the first brewer to aim for the world ’s strongest beer			0
in fact , there ’s been a battle going on for a couple of years			0
while it could be seen as an important piece of scientific exploration , others see it as just a bunch of not - quite - grown - up boys who want to be able to shout out to the world : ‘ mine is bigger than yours ! ’ three years ago , another @entity137 company , @entity136 , also based in north - east @entity38 , created @entity136 ( do n’t ask ) , which came in at 32 per cent alcohol			1
this threw down the gauntlet			0
in stepped a @entity142 brewer with @entity143 , a 40 per cent beer			1
so @entity136 retaliated with @entity145 , at 41 per cent			1
the @entity142 then came back with a 44 per cent brew , only for @entity136 to trump them with @entity147 , at 55 per cent alcohol ( though only 12 bottles were ever produced — and each cost £ 700 and as a gimmick was sold inside a stuffed squirrel )			1
first impressions : @entity23 found the ale to be quite bitter but he said it had a rather pleasant sweet aftertaste then in july 2010 a brewery in @entity157 looked to have seized the title — with a 60 per cent beer called start @entity160			1
until @entity22 came along with @entity8 a few weeks ago			1
the brewer says : ‘ we did n’t want just to break the record but to make something that ’s got some character to it , something beautifully sweet and malty			0
in an age of binge - drinking , is n’t it irresponsible to bring out a product as potent as this ? @entity22 says this is not a beer that problem - drinkers will turn to			1
‘ we ’ve designed it for people to consume like a fine brandy , in small amounts , not sitting in a park with a brown paper bag round the bottle			1
in any case , the price will put off problem - drinkers			1
these bottles are for sharing			2
’ so who is his typical customer ? ‘ people who like something different , who appreciate a fine quality product that ’s made in small batches by people who care about what they ’re doing			0
’ ( privately , i think there ’s a big market for stag parties			0
) the @entity28 brewery is certainly out of the ordinary			0
set in a tatty , 200 - year - old farm building on the estate of @entity204 , 25 miles outside @entity205 , it looks out on to the @entity206			2
they use spring water from the estate to make the beer			0
inside , there are metal vats and sacks of malted barley , hops and yeast — but it ’s clear everything is done on a very small scale : the beer is brewed in batches of just 40 bottles at a time			1
‘ though we plan to expand , ’ says @entity22			0
it takes some bottle : the world 's strongest beer certainly had a powerful effect on @entity23 the place , frankly , is a bit of a mess : there ’s an air rifle by the door — in case any rats decide to feast on the large sacks of grain piled against the wall			2
but @entity22 is no ordinary brewer			0
the son of an accountant and an oil executive , he ’s still only 26 , the same age as his business partner , @entity246			0
the pair launched the business with a £ 15,000 investment that @entity22 had amassed at university ( ‘ i started up a paintballing company while i was a student			2
’ ) though the business is still tiny — @entity22 has a day job with a bank , and @entity255 works off - shore in the oil industry — @entity22 says they ’ve already had orders from ‘ @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and a lot from @entity263 ’			2
the next batch of @entity8 , which will be ready in a few days , is sold out			1
' lethal weapon ' : @entity266 holds up a bottle of his 65 per cent strength beer @entity8 for the camera so what ’s the secret of this super-strength beer ? the answer is a process called ‘ freeze distillation ’			1
any traditional beer - maker can , with the right choice of yeast , get to a point where the beer is 10 or 12 per cent alcohol			1
after that , the high alcohol levels kill off the yeast that is turning the sugars in the malt into more alcohol , so you ca n’t get stronger beer using traditional methods			2
adventurous : at 65 per cent alcohol , @entity8 is stronger than whisky or brandy and 16 times more potent than a standard pub lager but @entity28 ’s trick is to cool the beer to zero degrees , when , of course , the water starts to freeze — but the alcohol does not			1
so if you discard the ice as it forms , making the drink less diluted , what you ’re left with is a very alcoholic mixture			0
but not a fiery one — because the alcohol is still swimming in the malty - hoppy mixture			1
‘ what we do is the reverse of conventional distillation			0
when you make whisky , you heat up the mixture and the alcohol evaporates , taking it away from the grain mixture			1
then it is condensed and aged in barrels			0
‘ but we leave the alcohol inside the grain mixture and take the water out			2
this means the end product tastes much sweeter and less harsh			0
’ it still qualifies as ‘ beer ’ since it uses the classic ingredients : water , malted barley , hops			0
@entity22 says : ‘ we do n’t add sugar or rice , rubbish like that , which you sometimes get in lagers			0
’ this , he insists , is a niche artisan product — albeit an expensive one at £ 80 a pop. the reason for the high cost ? they brew only very small quantities of beer at any one time , and the freeze distillation process means they throw away about 85 per cent of the brew mixture			1
plus , ‘ about £ 12 of the price goes straight to the taxman ’			1
‘ we are , ’ @entity22 says grandly , ‘ testing the boundaries of brewing			0
’ well , i suppose so			0
the truth is that despite its liver - busting alcohol content , it tastes far better than the tramp ’s favourite , @entity352 , which is 9 per cent			1
although the taste is nowhere near as enjoyable as that of a conventional real ale			0
as i leave the brewery , @entity22 says : ‘ we ’re in the process of having the record verified by the people from @entity360			0
’ with the mention of @entity360 , i suddenly feel thirsty — and realise that i ’ll be sticking to a more traditional beer .			0

at 65 per cent alcohol , @entity8 is more potent than whisky or brandy
it is brewed in @entity29 and each 330ml bottle contains 22 units
bottles cost £ 80 in the shops but can be bought from brewers half - price
