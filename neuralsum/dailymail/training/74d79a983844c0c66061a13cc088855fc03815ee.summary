a mother feasted on sponges and sand after developing insatiable cravings for both throughout her pregnancies			1
@entity8 - @entity7 ’s strange 20 - a - day habit saw her munch her way through thousands of washing - up sponges , washed down with piles of sand when she was pregnant with baby @entity12 and son @entity13			1
but despite her fondness for the bizarre snack - which she would often stack together to make sponge and sand sandwiches - both her children were born healthy and unharmed			1
mrs @entity7 , 28 , from @entity19 , said : ' it tasted really good at the time			1
' @entity8 - @entity7 , 28 , with her two children @entity13 , 4 , left , and @entity22 , 7 - months - old , right			1
mrs @entity7 feasted on sponges and sand after developing insatiable cravings for both throughout her pregnancies ' it was really satisfying			1
it was exactly what i needed			2
i was getting through bowls and bowls of sand a day			1
i was n’t eating anything else but sand and sponges			1
' it ’s like when you really fancy a bit of chocolate and you finally get a piece and its so satisfying			0
' the full - time mum suffered from @entity43 disorder throughout the pregnancies , which causes victims to crave objects that are not food			2
her unusual cravings started five months into her first pregnancy with @entity13 , now four , and were sparked when her mother - in - law was changing the sand in her parrot ’s cage			1
she explained : ' i kept getting this weird taste in my mouth			0
i knew i was craving something but could not put my finger on what until i saw the sand and that ’s when i knew i wanted it			2
' then when i saw her change the sand in the parrot ’s cage i thought " i could just eat that " and i asked her if i could have some and i started eating it			1
she thought it was mad but let me carry on			0
' when sand did n’t hit the spot , she turned to sponges and scoffed her way through packets a day and even combined the two to make sponge sand - wiches			1
' i was in the bath one day and i looked at the sponge			2
it was new and i just started eating it			0
' i would have a small bite then chew it for a bit until it went soft			0
i even dipped them in the sand - it tasted really good , ' she added			1
the bizarre craving saw her chomp on 5,000 washing - up sponges and sacks of sand while she was expecting			1
but both her children were born healthy and unharmed ' then i started eating washing up sponges but ripping the rough side off			1
' i went through loads and had to keep buying sand from the pet shop and lots of sponges			1
' i could not go anywhere without taking sand or sponges with me			1
it ’s very different to your normal pregnancy cravings			0
' the habit of eating non-edible objects could arise from some sort of deficiency			0
some sufferers eat dirt and many of them are found to lack iron , which is present in soil			0
others develop the condition because of extreme stress , though it is not clear why			0
a desire to eat cleaning agents may be linked with obsessive - compulsive disorder or just a liking for fragrances			2
@entity43 can lead to dangerous complications in the body 's metabolism			2
one type of treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy with an experienced psychologist			0
then when mrs @entity7 fell pregnant again last year with @entity12 , now seven months old , the crazy cravings returned and she went through the same routine of only eating sand and sponges all over again			1
her husband @entity136 , 31 , was worried her diet was harming his unborn children , but when the midwife told them it was fine , his wife continued			2
' i could n’t stop her then			0
she was completely addicted , ' he said			0
a spokesperson for @entity144 , the eating disorders charity , said : ' we do on occasion get people coming to us to say they are suffering from this condition			0
it does n’t provide any nutritional intake at all and can have long term health implications			0
' particularly when someone is pregnant , it ’s important to provide suitable nutrition for them and the growing baby			2
' it ’s important that any individual has a well - balanced diet and if they are worried that something like this is affecting them they should seek help at the earliest opportunity			2
' it is worth exploring with a good gp to see if there are serious issues that need to be resolved and whether cognitive behavioural therapy might be appropriate			0
' we would urge @entity174 to make themselves more familiar with this condition and other disordered eating patterns so people can get the help they need			0
' obviously the earlier the individual seeks help , the more likely it is that their problem can be overcome			0
