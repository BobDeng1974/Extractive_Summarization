the couple , who have already have a two - year - old daughter , said they were determined to bring all three babies into the world to join their ' happy family '			1
the former trampolinist said : ' we had our first scan in @entity33 at 12 weeks and were immediately referred to specialists at @entity48 in @entity49			2

' i also risk putting my body under three times the strain to keep them healthy , so they advised the termination			0
one of mrs @entity64 's ultrasound scans showing the three babies that she is expecting , which are all believed to be girls the 12 - week scan ( pictured ) showed one of the babies was 25 per cent smaller than the others and medics advised her to terminate two of them because they could cause serious risk to her health and the others ' my initial emotional reaction was " i ca n't do that , i will keep them all and carry on with the pregnancy whatever "			1
' @entity7 was much more logical wanting to know what the risks were to me but collectively we made the decision we would give the three babies the best opportunity we possibly could to come into the world			2
' other people have triplets and i was n't prepared to abort two healthy babies just to make life easier			2
' as sport has taught us both , all you need is a chance , positivity and the faith of others in your ability to be a success			0

@entity113 and her rugby star husband @entity7 ( left ) already have one child - two - year - old daughter @entity107 ( right ) @entity8 and her rugby star husband @entity7 , both 35 , have refused to terminate two of their unborn babies despite doctors advice consultants told them twins sharing a placenta are at risk of twin - to - twin syndrome of @entity129 ( @entity129 )			1
adding another baby into the equation has made her pregnancy particularly high - risk and even more rare and complicated			2
mrs @entity64 is now 26 weeks and has been told she will have to deliver the triplets , all believed to be girls , by caesarean			1
the new arrivals will then have to stay in incubators and be monitored carefully before they can be taken home			0
the 35 - year - old , who began trampolining when she was 10 and is now a coach whilst running a cake - making business from home , added : ' i am as big now as i was at full - term with @entity107			1
' but the hardest thing is avoiding making plans for when they are born			0
we have checks almost weekly as things keep changing			0
' if this was my first pregnancy i would be terrified , but seeing how ace @entity107 is makes me confident we can do this			0
@entity153 , a former @entity104 rugby player , and @entity113 pictured on their wedding day in 2009 ' now the panic has gone , we can be excited about our big family and noisy house			0
' i am determined to make this happen			0
i could not live with myself if i sacrificed two of them - to save one			0
' mr @entity8 - now a pe teacher - added : ' reaching 24 weeks was a big milestone for @entity8			2
if they stay in there until 30 weeks then it gives me a much better chance of being born with less problems			0
' everything went well at the last scan and all three babies are growing well			2
the one twin remains smaller but all three are extremely active which is good news			0
' we also had the chances to see the faces of our three little girls on a 3d scan which was really exciting			0
' we never thought about terminating two of the babies for a second , we want to bring all three of them into our happy family			0
' @entity8 was @entity101 's first female trampolinist at the 2000 @entity102 and after some time out recovering from injuries , she earned the team their place in the @entity192 in 2008 and was then a reserve @entity8 ( left ) after tampolining at the @entity194 , @entity195			1
