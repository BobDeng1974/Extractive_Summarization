by @entity1 reporter published : 09:43 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 10:54 est , 24 february 2013 an underwater ' @entity2 ' has been captured in a series of spectacular images created by a @entity6 survey ship			1
@entity7 discovered the 250 metre - deep canyon in the @entity9 during a nine - month mission to improve understanding of the waters east of @entity13			1
the 3d images were created after the ship left the @entity17 port of @entity18 and were made using the @entity21 - based survey ship 's multibeam echo sounder			1
a @entity2 - style ocean floor hidden deep under the @entity9 has been discovered by @entity7 and beamed back to land in these incredible images the ship used state - of - the - art surveying equipment to reveal the natural wonder during her nine - month mission to improve understanding of the waters east of @entity13 commander @entity31 , said the features could be the result of ancient rivers scouring through the rock strata before the @entity9 flooded millennia ago commander @entity31 , commanding officer of @entity7 , said : ' these features could be the result of ancient rivers scouring through the rock strata before the @entity9 flooded millennia ago			1
submarine canyons are steep - sided valleys cut into the sea floor			2
the deepest below - water canyon in the world is in the @entity45 off the coast of @entity47 , which falls nearly 5,000m underneath the surface			2
other canyons of note are in the @entity52 and @entity53 rivers			0
a canyon in the @entity55 is the largest river canyon in the world			0
the major mechanism of canyon erosion is now thought to be turbidity currents and underwater landslides			0
turbidity currents are dense , sediment - laden currents which flow downslope when an unstable mass of sediment that has been rapidly deposited on the upper slope fails , perhaps triggered by earthquakes			0
' some may be far younger and still in the process of being created by underwater currents driven by the winds and tidal streams as they flow through this area of the @entity9 , carving their way through the soft sediment and being diverted by harder bed rock			1
' or there is always the possibility that they are a combination of the two			0
' it is , however , almost certain to say that this is the closest that humans will ever get to gaze upon these truly impressive sights hundreds of metres beneath the surface			2
' the echo sounder , which is fitted to @entity88 's hull , produces the images from the echoes returning from the sound pulses it sends out			2
this is a highly accurate way to measure the sea bed to determine if the depth of water is safe for navigation and shipping			0
@entity7 will remain in the @entity99 until the summer to continue its task of updating some of the 3,300 - plus @entity101 which are used by many of the world 's seafarers , including the @entity6			0
the ship went on its mission to the east of the @entity17 port city of @entity18 @entity7 made the incredible discovery as part of a fact finding mission to update shipping charts			1
