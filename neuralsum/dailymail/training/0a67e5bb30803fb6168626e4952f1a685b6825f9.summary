it said one in ten problems it has looked at associated with @entity44 was a scam or potential scam			1
the watchdog gave the example of a flat hunter who saw a property advertised on @entity2 and handed over £ 1,650 to the person he thought was the landlord			1
however , when he tried to move in , someone else was already living there			0
in another case a man bought a car on @entity44 for £ 360 and spent another £ 700 on repairs , however it was then repossessed because the previous owner had failed to pay off an outstanding loan			2
however , this is just the tip of the iceberg and there is evidence from a large and growing number of court cases and police reports that criminals use @entity2 to : citizens advice looked at problems reported to its offices in the six months to the end of march which concerned products or services bought through @entity2 and @entity44			1
there were 649 cases related to @entity2 and 3,711 to @entity44			2
victims of online crime are invited to report the case to @entity86 , which collects the details and passes some of them on to local police forces			1

@entity2 is particularly vulnerable because the website does not vet or take identification details from its users , which means it can be used time and again by criminals who are difficult to trace ‘ it ’s time for online marketplaces to up their game and do more to protect their customers from dodgy dealings by strongly policing their websites , carrying out spot checks and immediately removing any risky ads. ’ @entity2 said : ‘ we do everything in our power to keep scammers off our site and encourage anyone that has fallen for a scam , to report it to us and the police			1
‘ @entity2 is an open platform which provides a free and easy way to buy and sell , meaning we do not track user information			1
we are always looking at new ways to improve customer safety such as improving methods of communication between us and our customers			0
‘ we encourage all our users to adhere to our safety tips on the site and discourage people from transferring any money in advance of seeing an item for sale			0
’ @entity44 questioned the validity of the research			0
