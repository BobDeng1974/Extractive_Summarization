by @entity0 published : 18:27 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 18:27 est , 11 august 2013 taxpayer - funded foreign aid supplies worth nearly half a million pounds ended up in the hands of @entity4 terrorists			1
the supplies were seized from a warehouse by militant @entity8 group @entity7 as it rampaged through southern @entity9			1
details of the thefts were buried in the @entity13 ’s latest annual accounts			1
the growing chorus of fury the thefts took place in repeated incidents over a four - month period between november 2011 and february 2012 – raising questions as to why no action was taken			1
the revelations will increase pressure on ministers over @entity25 ’s spiralling aid budget			1
last week @entity27 mep @entity26 criticised increases in aid spending , saying it was going to dictators to buy ‘ @entity33 sunglasses , apartments in @entity35 and @entity36 ’			1
he was criticised for using the phrase ‘ @entity38 ’ to describe recipients of aid			1
but commentators also backed his wider point about sharp increases in aid spending as the rest of government is enduring sharp cuts			2
he said : ‘ how we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month , when we ’re in this sort of debt , to @entity38 is completely beyond me			0
’ the @entity50 revealed last week that , during the length of this parliament , more than a billion pounds of aid was going to oil - rich @entity54 , which has its own space programme and wants to put a man in space			2
four other countries in @entity59 with space programmes are also in receipt of lavish aid spending			2
outspoken : his exact wording may have been out of order , but the point @entity26 was trying to get across on foreign aid may hit home now @entity7 is a cell of @entity4 which , last year , threatened to carry out an attack on @entity25 that would ‘ eclipse the horrors of 7/7 and 21/7 combined ’			1
several @entity25 nationals are known to have trained with the group			2
@entity13 stated that there was no prior warning of the attacks and its partner organisations in @entity9 were unable to move the supplies			2
the accounts said the £ 480,000 was written off ‘ following the theft between november 2011 and february 2012 , by @entity7 in southern @entity9 , of @entity13 - funded humanitarian materials and supplies from the offices and warehouses of partner organisations , to which @entity13 had provided funding to deliver projects and programmes ’			1
‘ @entity13 ’s partners had no prior warning of the confiscations being carried out and therefore had no time to prevent the loss by relocating goods			0
‘ while the theft suffered represented a stores loss , the property was not stolen from @entity13 stores			0
@entity13 funding was provided to purchase goods but no benefit was received by the end recipient due to the theft			0
’ last night a spokesman claimed the supplies had been destroyed by the group			1
it said among the items stolen was ‘ petty cash ’			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity13 works in some of the most dangerous places in the world , including @entity9 , because tackling the root causes of poverty and instability there ensures a safer world and a safer @entity25			0
' working in conflict - affected and fragile states carries inherent risk			0
@entity13 does all it can to mitigate against this but , on occasion , losses will occur			0
‘ we work with our partners to design programmes that protect our investment from misuse or theft			0
’ aid spending is set to reach nearly £ 11billion by 2015 , to meet a pledge by mr @entity130 that taxpayers should give away 0.7 per cent of gdp every year			2
a spokesman for the @entity135 ’ @entity133 said : ‘ this is yet more evidence of how hard it is to turn good intentions into genuine help for those in countries with deeply dysfunctional politics where security can not be taken for granted			0
‘ many taxpayers will see this as more evidence that foreign aid should not be increasing dramatically when there is so much pressure on other budgets			0

the supplies were seized by militant @entity8 group @entity7
thefts were repeated incidents , yet no action was taken
comes after @entity158 criticised how aid was being handed out
