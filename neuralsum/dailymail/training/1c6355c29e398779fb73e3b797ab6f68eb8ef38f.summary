shadow foreign secretary @entity0 has said ' political correctness ' stops people speaking out against @entity4 persecution for fear of causing offence politicians should not let a ‘ sense of embarrassment ’ about religion stop them speaking out against persecution of @entity11 , a @entity8 frontbencher has said			1
foreign affairs spokesman @entity0 said @entity11 are under growing attack around the world , and referred to @entity19 spin doctor @entity18 ’s phrase , ‘ we do n’t do @entity20 ’			1
he said : ‘ perhaps through			0
some sense of embarrassment at “ doing @entity20 ” in an age when secularism is more common , too many politicians seem to fear discussing any matters relating to faith			0
' so the growing persecution of @entity11 around the world remains a story that goes largely untold			2
’ the @entity8 shadow foreign secretary 's calls follow a speech by @entity34 last week in which the heir to the throne warned that @entity4 was beginning to disappear from its birthplace because members and places of worship were being targetted			1
writing in @entity41 , mr @entity0 said : ' across the world , there will be @entity11 this week for whom attending a church service this @entity44 is not an act of faithful witness , but an act of life - risking bravery			1
that can not be right and we need the courage to say so			0
' people of all faiths and none should be horrified by this persecution			2
we can not , and we must not , stand by on the other side in silence for fear of offence			0
' mr @entity0 , who is a @entity62 follower , added that persecution of @entity11 should be viewed in the same way as @entity65 or @entity66 , and not just opposed by lone voices			1
speaking at an event for @entity69 @entity11 , prince @entity34 said that bridges between @entity71 and @entity4 were being ' deliberately destroyed ' and that @entity4 was being driven from its birthplace he said he had felt ' very personally ' an attack on a @entity62 place of worship in september which killed 122 including the mother , nephew , niece , two uncles and other friends of the priest			1
last week prince @entity34 said that bridges between the @entity71 and @entity4 communities he had worked to foster were being ' deliberately destroyed '			1
speaking at an event for @entity69 @entity11 in @entity86 , he said : ‘ it seems to me that we can not ignore the fact that @entity89 are increasingly being deliberately targeted by fundamentalist @entity91 militants			1
‘ @entity4 was literally born in the @entity69 and we must not forget our @entity69 brothers and sisters in @entity94			2
’ others have also issued warnings on the issue , including @entity98 who delivered a speech to the @entity100 last month on the ' mass exodus ' of @entity11 from the @entity69 , and former chief rabbi @entity102			2
mr @entity0 's comments come in stark contrast to the @entity8 government 's stance under @entity19 , when @entity18 famously said that the party ' does n't do @entity20 '			0
since retiring from politics mr @entity19 himself has become a @entity110 , and says he was a believer while in office but was too afraid to admit it in case he was viewed as ' a nutter '			0
the article by mr @entity0 marks a shift towards religion in politics , with @entity121 being an active member of the @entity122 - though he admits his faith can be patchy - and @entity124 saying he has a ' huge respect ' for people who believe in @entity20 , despite being an atheist himself			2
mr @entity0 ’s words were welcomed by @entity122 leaders			0
the @entity131 , @entity132 , said : ' too often these situations are ignored by politicians worried at offending someone			0
such silence should be offensive to all who cherish the right to live safely in a pluralistic society			0

@entity0 says more needs to be done in order to stop @entity11 in the @entity69 being attacked and places of worship being targeted
