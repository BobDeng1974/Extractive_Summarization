but then i realised i had no money , nowhere to stay , no luggage , no underwear , not even tooothpaste			0
i had also left my glasses at home so was struggling to see			0
' i also had never been abroad on my own before			0
' for the next three days i wandered around in my three - piece suit and had to buy some flip - flops because shoes were hurting			1
i could n't afford trainers			0
' the worst thing was that @entity4 was below freezing			2

he had used the passport he had taken to the pub as @entity91 to leave @entity92			0
after a conversation with airline staff in @entity4 he learned his return flight home was in three days , but he had no accommodation booked in the city and only £ 50 in his pocket			1
but any hopes that he would be rescued by his mother @entity101 , 58 , evaporated because she agreed to pay for a hotel room but no earlier flight because he ' had made his bed and had to lie in it '			2

home : supermarket worker @entity6 thought he was in bed in @entity8 , @entity115 , pictured , but was actually at @entity21 in the @entity14 capital dream destination : @entity4 is one of the world 's most vibrant cities , but mr @entity6 struggled because he had booked three days there but had no money his father @entity122 , 57 , said today : ' it is unbelievable			1

he said : ' it 's funny now , but i was n't laughing then			0
i 'm not planning any more adventures			0
