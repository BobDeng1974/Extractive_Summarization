by @entity0 published : 03:06 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 19:16 est , 29 august 2013 clever man : @entity2 was plagued by cold calls so hit back with his own premium - rate phone number fed up with the constant barrage of unwanted calls , @entity2 decided it was time to take revenge			1
the businessman turned the tables on the cold - callers by setting up his own premium rate phone number – and has since pocketed £ 300 as a result			1
mr @entity2 said he was inundated with calls to his landline from salesmen , especially those offering help with compensation claims for mis - sold @entity19 , so decided to make them pay to speak to him			1
the 25 - year - old paid £ 10 plus vat to set up a personal 0871 landline and now makes money every time he receives an unsolicited phone call			2
he said it was ‘ extremely easy ’ to set up the number online			2
he chose an 0871 number because it was more profitable than one starting with 0845 or 0844			1
mr @entity2 said he gave out the premium rate number whenever he needed to talk to utility companies but had a separate line for his friends and family to call			1
‘ i was getting annoyed at the @entity19 calls i was constantly getting so i thought there must be a way to make money out of them , ’ he said			1
‘ i decided i would get an 08 number and realised if i had an 0871 number they would be charged 10p a minute			2
‘ out of this i get to keep 9p for every minute , so i phoned up all of my service providers and told them i would be changing my number			0
this was in 2011 and i ’ve made £ 300 from it			1
’ mr @entity2 , who runs an e-commerce business from his home in @entity49 , said the cold calls had now dried up , but he continues to make a few pounds a month from utilities trying to sell their products			2
‘ companies ring me up and the first thing they ask is , “ why do you have an 0871 number ? ” , ’ he said			1
‘ i tell them it is so i can make money out of them			0
‘ @entity61 were particularly annoyed and would n’t call me			0
they ’d keep emailing me , but i ’d tell them to call me			0
eventually they gave in , but i have left them now and they regularly call asking me to rejoin them			0
’ frustration : the calls came , as usual , in the evening during @entity2 's favourite shows , so he spend £ 10 plus vat on his own 0871 number ( file picture ) far from dreading the nuisance calls , mr @entity2 now says he relishes the sound of the phone ringing			1
‘ i actually want to be cold - called now , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’d definitely recommend everyone to do it – it definitely stops the @entity19 calls			1
’ but premium number regulator phone @entity80 yesterday warned other members of the public against trying the same thing			0
a spokesman told @entity87 programme : ‘ premium - rate numbers are not designed to be used in this way and we would strongly discourage any listeners from adopting this idea , as they will be liable under our code for any breaches and subsequent fines that result			0
’ consumer champion which ? has been extremely critical of cold - callers and launched @entity99 campaign in march			0
the campaign called for an expiry date on third - party consent , so firms have a limited period to call a consumer after they tick the opt - in box on a form			0
it is estimated that up 700million nuisance calls are received every month			0
research by which ? found eight in ten people have received an unsolicited call in the past month , while six in ten have received calls about @entity19 and half have taken calls from accident claim companies .			2

@entity2 has made £ 300 since he set up his own 0871 number
' i was annoyed with the @entity19 calls when i *'m* trying to watch @entity123 ' , he said
kept his free line for friends and family and premium rate for companies
