@entity1 motorsport boss @entity0 has urged @entity3 's moaners to visit the @entity4 if they want their prayers answered on a change to the sport 's regulations			1
@entity0 was responding to the latest complaints from @entity12 team boss @entity11 in the wake of @entity1 ' crushing start to the 2015 season as @entity16 spearheaded a one - two in the season - opening @entity18 @entity17			1
@entity11 was left to reflect on ' a s * * * * * sunday ' and the fear fans will turn off @entity3 after @entity1 ' domination of the race at @entity24 's @entity23 @entity25 showers winner @entity16 after @entity1 finish on - two at @entity18 @entity17 @entity16 races to victory as @entity1 extend last season 's dominance into the new campaign @entity1 chief @entity0 has told critics of his team to work to find a solution after winning the constructors ' and drivers ' titles for four years from 2010 - 2013 , with @entity38 at the helm , @entity1 have taken up the mantle of @entity3 powerhouse			1
having won 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors ' crown , and with @entity16 clinching his second championship , the start to the new year was a breeze for @entity1			1
@entity16 beat team - mate @entity25 by 1.3secs , with @entity38 third on his debut for @entity51 but 34.5secs off the pace			1
predicting ' a two - horse race at every grand prix this year ' , @entity11 has called on the @entity55 to act to prevent an @entity3 yawn , and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given @entity12 's success			1
' when we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - i remember double diffusers were banned , exhausts were moved , flexible bodywork was prohibited , engine mapping mid-season was changed , ' said @entity11 of the steps taken to negate his team 's performance			2
@entity12 's @entity11 has complained about @entity1 , despite his team winning four consecutive titles @entity11 claim that leaving @entity16 and @entity25 to fight it out for the title is unhealthy for the sport re-live every lap of the @entity24 race ' anything was done and that was n't just unique to @entity12 , but @entity78 in previous years and @entity79 , etcetera			1
' is it healthy to have this situation ? the @entity55 , within the rules , have an equalisation mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at			0
' @entity1 , take nothing away from them , they have done a great job and they have a good car , a fantastic engine , and two very good drivers			2
' the problem is the gap is so big you end up with three - tier racing and that 's not healthy for @entity3			0
' the @entity55 have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of equalisation otherwise i fear the interest will wane			0
' i did n't see @entity1 much on the tv and i can only imagine that 's because it 's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race			0
' referring to the fact @entity111 star @entity110 conducted the podium ceremony , @entity11 added : ' the highlight for me was to see @entity110 on the podium ! ' hollywood star @entity110 interviews @entity16 after his winning start to the season responding to the call for equalisation , @entity0 said : ' if you come into @entity3 , try to beat each other and perform at the highest level and then you need equalisation after the first race - you cry out after the first race - that 's not how we 've done things in the past			1
' i think ' just get your f * * * * * * head down , work hard and try to sort it out '			0
' quickly clarifying his remark , @entity0 added : ' i did n't mean the f - word in relation to him ( @entity11 )			1
' asked whether he feared another political season , @entity0 replied : ' it is always a political season			0
it was last year and it is this year			0
' there is this wall in @entity142 that you can stand in front of and complain			0
maybe the guys should go there			0
