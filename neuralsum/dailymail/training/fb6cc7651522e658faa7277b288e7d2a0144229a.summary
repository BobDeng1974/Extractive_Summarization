using a photograph , the program rearranges the face to produce less than alluring results			1
make - over gone wrong : @entity3 pictured before ( left ) and after ( right ) the @entity7 treatment ugly : the app has distorted @entity20 's perfect complexion and delicate button nose beyond recognition those with perfect complexion suddenly find they are covered in spots , and dainty features are enlarged while the eyes are brought closer together			1
in these hilarious pictures , @entity29 star @entity3 looks a far cry from her usual preened self			2
and @entity33 certainly would n't have landed his beautiful wives @entity34 and @entity36 if he was really given this ' ugly ' transformation			0
celebrities @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 also look almost unrecognisable in the shots			0
new look hunk : would @entity45 have gone for @entity46 if he looked like his @entity7 equivalent ? distorted : @entity40 cares about her looks			1
she would n't want to see this spotty : at least @entity42 and @entity39 could comfort each other in their new @entity7 incarnations all falls down : although maybe @entity42 would be @entity39 's own runaway with a nose and jaw like this uglyfied : @entity55 's model good looks have been completely destroyed by the app not so hunky now : @entity58 hunk @entity57 looks like a cartoon character after the @entity7 treatment and heartthrobs @entity46 and @entity62 would no doubt cringe ifthey caught sight of their ' ugly ' selves			2
the newly - distorted photo can be sent via text , email , @entity68 or @entity69 so you can share the makeover with friends - if you dare			0
