there was a hum of mutinous muttering as they trooped out of the @entity4 on saturday night			1
no strident protest , no outright rebellion , nothing so crude ; but the frustration , the discontent were all too evident			0
it was best expressed at @entity12 ’s press conference , when an earnest scribbler began : ‘ @entity12 : dominating teams and not finishing them off			0
is it a case of deja vu ? ’ a pause : ‘ of course , you ’ll know what that means			0
’ for half a second , the manager ’s post-match face hovered on the brink of a smile			0
but the summary had been perfectly accurate			0
having fashioned sufficient chances in the first 25 minutes to have won half a dozen matches , @entity28 frittered them one by one			1
the @entity4 sensed a penalty would be paid , and they were right			0
@entity28 's @entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 look dejected after their 2 - 1 defeat against @entity36 the result heaps pressure on boss @entity12 as his side could have won the match inside the first half @entity36 were second best at pretty well everything , save the one virtue which counts for more than all the others			1
@entity44 demonstrated it to clinical perfection			1
@entity44 spent 85 minutes watching some of the most expensive attackers in @entity50 football miss chance upon chance			1
then , with @entity36 breaking at pace and the @entity28 defence suicidally stretched , he accelerated on to a pass , changed from foot to foot , and raised a delicate chip beyond the goalkeeper			1
as lessons go , it was utterly emphatic			0
yet @entity44 knew , @entity28 knew , everybody in this part of @entity64 knew that @entity28 should have been home and hosed before @entity36 had even raised their voice			1
but the chest - thumping chants of @entity36 ’s travelling circus told their own story			1
@entity36 were installed in the top four , while what might have been a night of solid @entity28 advancement became a slow decline into upper mid-table			1
@entity44 ( right ) scored @entity36 's second goal in their 2 - 1 win at @entity28 @entity36 captain @entity44 celebrates scoring his side 's second in their victory on saturday night @entity79 was another manager who almost cracked a smile ; with good reason			1
but @entity36 ’s manager is a serious man , who delivers his messages with the controlled frenzy of a revivalist preacher			1
@entity87 words are barked in mid-sentence , startling the sleepy with their passion : ‘ when we keep ! the ball , when we show ! confidence , then we create big chances , ’ he boomed			0
one imagines he might be a revelation at half - time			1
but he was honest enough to admit : ‘ if @entity28 had scored in the first 20 minutes , then it is another game			1
’ we went into the match aware that both clubs have known better days			0
@entity99 was when they debated the glittering prizes , now they tend to know their place ; a couple of dowagers , squabbling over the dinner service while the men with new money make off with the deeds to the castle			0
attacking talent fairly flooded the field ; @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 on one side , @entity44 , @entity116 and @entity117 on the other			1
but , by comparison , the defences were accidents waiting to happen			0
@entity28 have long toiled to accommodate their suspect central defenders , but @entity36 ’s injury list has pushed players like @entity125 and @entity126 into situations which ideally would have been long delayed			1
@entity36 boss @entity79 watched the first half pensively as @entity28 dominated the opening exchanges @entity28 striker @entity112 ( left ) spurned a great chance when his shot was blocked by @entity125 as they struggled through those early anxieties , @entity132 sat in his dugout , looking inscrutable			1
the assumption used to be that he was thinking profound thoughts			0
now , nobody is quite so sure			0
but , as he would later point out , the result is the starting point of all the inquests			2
@entity28 were dazzling in that early passage			2
their pace was bewildering , their passing inspired , and all the doubts which @entity36 ’s defenders were clearly nourishing came crowding remorselessly in			2
but the finishing ; ah , the finishing ! @entity112 was profligate , @entity113 careless , while @entity114 treated his chances with the extravagance of a lottery winner in a casino			0
and as they wasted chance upon chance , @entity36 sensed that there were points of their own to be made			2
after half an hour , the match produced a revealing cameo			0
with a scrappy challenge , @entity114 provoked a sadly unequal spat with @entity162			0
as the @entity36 player reacted , @entity114 thrust his head towards his opponent ’s face , twice			2
had the big man been in theatrical mood , then @entity28 would unquestionably , and needlessly , have been reduced to 10			2
@entity114 ( right ) was lucky not to be sent off after appearing to headbutt @entity162 @entity114 brings many qualities to this team , but there is a truculent self - indulgence which threatens to prevent his becoming the kind of player he ought to be			2
by now , @entity44 was more influential , @entity162 was an imposing target , while @entity176 can not be subdued for half a match			2
you could almost touch the apprehension and @entity114 ’s departure increased that tension			0
he made a truly forlorn spectacle as he limped away , and you wondered how his team would cope without his creativity			0
within a minute , the first @entity36 goal provided the answer			1
we sensed it would not be @entity28 ’s night , and they started to play as if they knew it			1
the chance still cropped up , but there was an absence of conviction , optimism , all those qualities which teams at the top tend to take for granted			0
as @entity36 flourished , @entity28 feared there was even worse ahead			1
and they were absolutely right			0
@entity113 ( centre ) was guilty of careless finishing as @entity28 missed several opportunities			2

@entity36 won 2 - 1 away at @entity28 on saturday night
a @entity33 own goal and a @entity44 strike put @entity36 2 - 0 ahead
@entity208 scored in injury time for the @entity210
result sees united in fourth , with @entity28 are *eighth* in the @entity213
