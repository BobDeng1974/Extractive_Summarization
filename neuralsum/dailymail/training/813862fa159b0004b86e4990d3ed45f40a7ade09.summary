by @entity0 last updated at 12:31 am on 2nd february 2012 turning down a pay rise : @entity2 with his wife @entity3 and their children @entity6 and @entity7 stripping child benefit from 1.5million families is unfair and could encourage them to work less , leading financial analysts say			1
the @entity11 said the way in which the @entity13 was targeting high earners was ill considered			1
in some cases parents might even be better off apart			1
all families with young children are given the benefit and – for a couple with two children – it is worth £ 1,752 a year			2
but next year the chancellor is planning to stop payouts to parents if one or both is on £ 42,475 or more – the threshold for the higher rate of tax			2
the @entity11 ’s report slammed the ‘ cliff - edge ’ nature of @entity32 ’s move , which triggered fury when it was announced last october			1
a couple who both work and each earn £ 42,000 will continue to receive the benefit while having a family income of £ 84,000			1
but a couple where one parent earns £ 43,000 and the other earns nothing because they stay at home to look after the children will lose it all			2
the @entity11 said this will ‘ create a bizarre and economically damaging set of incentives ’ which may make people work less			1
around 170,000 parents would be better off if they asked their boss for a pay cut in order to continue receiving child benefit			2
the @entity11 says the policy will also ‘ increase the so - called couple penalty ’ , a problem the @entity57 had pledged to tackle			1
a single parent might be put off from marrying a higher rate taxpayer due to the loss of the benefit , while a couple could split in order to keep it			0
@entity65 , a family expert and the author of @entity67 , said the child benefit change was ‘ anti-family ’			0
she added : ‘ the @entity11 ’s analysis underlines just how unfair this change will be for one - earner families			1
it is out of touch with family life , and just how expensive it is			0
’ @entity75 , co-founder of @entity76 , said : ‘ you could not , under any circumstances , argue that it is fair			0
’ one user of the parenting website said : ‘ i am absolutely outraged that i have friends who both earn in the region of what my husband earns so they have an income of £ 80,000 , and they will still get the benefit			0
' anti-family ' : the change will be unfair for one - earner families and is out - of - touch , critics say ‘ that is so grossly unfair			0
i am fit to burst with anger			0
’ another said her children would lose out because she will have to move from working four days a week to full time to make up for the loss of her child benefit			1
dr @entity99 of the @entity100 said : ‘ this report is the latest warning that the government ’s child benefit reform proposals could usher in an unfair penalty for many single - earner couples			0
’ the @entity107 insisted yesterday the policy will go ahead despite hints from the prime minister that there may be concessions			0
a spokesman said : ‘ it is fair to ask those who are better off in our society to make a contribution to paying down the debts that we have built up over the last decade in @entity121			0

move could encourage *claimants* to work less , analysts say
@entity11 said move will ' create a bizarre and economically damaging set of incentives '
