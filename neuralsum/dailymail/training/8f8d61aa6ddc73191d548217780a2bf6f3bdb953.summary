lawyer @entity0 demanded a corruption inquiry into her colleagues at @entity4 rule of law mission in @entity5 when @entity7 lawyer @entity0 was given the chance to help rebuild war - torn @entity5 with an elite @entity12 anti-crime and corruption unit three years ago she jumped at the chance			1
fifteen years after the conflict , @entity5 remains a lawless region , with gangsters , corrupt politicians and war criminals threatening the integrity of the @entity12 borders			1
but @entity0 could hardly have known she would soon be demanding a corruption investigation into her own colleagues – or that she would then be escorted out of her office after becoming a whistleblower , and abruptly suspended			1
today , six years after taking the job , the 55 - year - old says the investigations unit , known as @entity4 , failed to pursue her allegations thoroughly and instead chose to ‘ punish ’ her for speaking out			1
‘ i have been subject to a campaign of victimisation and my career with @entity4 is over			1
i may well not work again , ’ she told @entity29			0
‘ more to the point this affair raises wider questions about what @entity4 has achieved over the six years of its existence and at what cost to the @entity12 and the @entity7 taxpayer			1
' our money is going into this mission and most of the staff work part - time but get a full - time salary			0
they disappear on thursday or friday morning , fly home and reappear on monday afternoon or tuesday morning			0
’ her worrying story has not only rocked the anti-corruption unit , which has so far swallowed £ 750million of @entity12 money , but could – if her allegations stick – envelop the @entity12 in a major corruption scandal			0
there is already an official @entity12 investigation into the affair			0
ms @entity0 ’s concerns reached a head during an investigation into a senior civil servant at the @entity5 health ministry			1
the man , @entity63 , had been arrested and held in prison amid allegations he had demanded bribes from pharmaceutical companies in return for official contracts			1
he had also smuggled a phone into his cell			0
@entity63 was arrested and held in prison amid allegations he had demanded bribes from pharmaceutical companies in return for official contracts ‘ i got a court order to intercept his calls because he was not entitled to have that phone , ’ says ms @entity0			1
‘ we monitored the calls			0
’ and the results , gathered in may and june 2012 , were disturbing			0
it became clear @entity63 was taking calls from people claiming to be intermediaries or go - betweens between @entity88 judge @entity87 , who was seconded to @entity4 , and @entity0 ’s boss , the @entity91 chief prosecutor @entity90			1
the intermediaries told @entity63 that the @entity88 judge would ‘ do everything to help because he thinks that man [ @entity63 ] deserves to be helped			2
’ @entity0 was alarmed to find she was herself the subject of these illegal discussions			2
it was claimed , for example , that the @entity88 judge , had described @entity0 as ‘ very difficult ’ and that @entity87 had suggested he would get @entity0 replaced			2
@entity63 was allegedly taking calls from people claiming to be intermediaries between @entity88 judge @entity87 ( right ) and @entity0 ’s boss , the @entity91 chief prosecutor @entity90 ( left ) another of the middlemen told @entity63 he would hold a meeting with @entity0 ’s boss , her ‘ chief … the @entity91 lady ’			1
in one call , @entity109 offers the observation that , ‘ i will analyse and see whether i can afford it or not ’			0
the implication was all too clear : two senior colleagues in @entity4 could well be compromised , wittingly or otherwise			1
@entity87 and @entity90 have denied any wrongdoing to @entity29			2
ms @entity0 continued : ‘ i could not investigate or prosecute @entity116 or @entity87 because i can not be a prosecutor and witness			1
’ eventually , she says , despite the concerns she had raised , she realised there was no proper investigation			2
her suspicions grew stronger when she was approached by two men convicted of a 2009 bomb attack in the @entity5 capital @entity126 amid allegations of a feud between a gangster and a police officer for the hand of a pop singer			2
it resulted in a fatal explosion			0
ms @entity0 claims she was ' victimised ' and ' punished ' for speaking out as she was suspended and escorted out of @entity4 headquarters last month the two convicted men , it seemed , had made their own approaches to the @entity88 judge			1
she said : ‘ they told me they had paid money to @entity141 ... and one of the family made a statement how he went to @entity145 with his lawyer to do negotiations with @entity87 and they were told that € 300,000 was only enough for one of them to be cleared			0
but when i reported this all that happened was that i got punished			0
i began to be subject to a series of investigations for trivial offences such as car parking			0
in reality no one got investigated			0
’ eventually she went on @entity5 television to outline her claims			1
@entity5 broke away from @entity161 in 1999 and became a @entity163 protectorate after its bloody war , which pitched the @entity166 minority against the majority ethnic @entity145			2
in 2008 the ethnic @entity145 - led parliament declared unilateral independence and the @entity163 unit was replaced by @entity4 that same year			2
ms @entity0 claims she asked for protection because of her role as a whistleblower but when @entity174 was downsized she was made redundant			1
although reinstated on appeal , she was suspended and escorted out of the @entity4 headquarters last month after repeating her allegations			1
@entity4 accused her of leaking documents to the press , a charge @entity0 denies			1
now back in @entity183 , the mother of one said : ‘ i only went to the press after the story came out to clear my name			0
’ @entity4 has announced a fresh investigation but in a sign of @entity191 impatience with the unit the @entity12 ’s new foreign policy chief @entity188 has despatched a lawyer to oversee the investigation			1
‘ for @entity197 ’s sake , they need to call a lawyer to say how an anti-corruption unit should deal with corruption ! ’ she said			2
‘ they are meant to be a rule of law mission			1
’ @entity203 , @entity204 for @entity205 , said he had met senior @entity12 officials about the case			0
‘ these allegations are credible and very serious , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity12 has to have zero tolerance to corruption			0
it is clear the existing investigation is inadequate			0
it appears it could be a cover - up			0
@entity0 has been let down badly			2
