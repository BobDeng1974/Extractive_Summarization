by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam what 's in a name ? two things if you ’re @entity5 , @entity7 ’s brilliant boxing prospect for @entity9 gold who deliberately miss - spells his first name and is fighting to make a claim to his second			1
for @entity5 , it ’s a hefty challenge – his cousin was a footballer of some renown for @entity19			1
‘ they call @entity21 ” around @entity19 , ’ says @entity5			1
‘ i ’m my own man , though			2
he made his name being a brilliant footballer			1
i want to make mine even bigger by being a brilliant boxer			1
’ he ’s made a solid start			2
he ’s the @entity19 middleweight identified by @entity27 , one of @entity29 ’s finest coaches , as ‘ the complete package ’ , a workhorse in the gym with the kick of a donkey in his right hand			1
glove affair : @entity5 will represent @entity7 at the @entity9 in @entity37 @entity21 : @entity5 wants to step out of cousin and former @entity19 striker @entity21 's shadow ‘ not many amateurs knock people out like @entity5 , ’ @entity27 says			1
some 46 of his 130 wins have come early , an excellent ratio in the world of big gloves and padded heads , and @entity48 told him he has the makings of a future world champion			1
@entity5 has a technician ’s touch , a quick mouth and a pragmatist ’s mind , a man who spells his name as ‘ @entity58 ’ on @entity59 because ‘ that ’s how people will search for it on @entity62 and in boxing you have to be noticed ’			1
that time could come for the 23 - year - old in the next fortnight when he laces up his gloves at the @entity68			2
‘ as a kid i was always in @entity21 ’s shadow , ’ @entity5 says			1
‘ i ’d love to one day be bigger than him			2
i ’m not being disrespectful when i say that because he was such a big player and he ’s my cousin			1
i see him every few months and i ’m a @entity19 fan			1
‘ we ’re all proud of him , and his dad , @entity74 , my uncle , was a huge influence on me as a young fighter			2
my uncle gave me the same attitude he gave @entity21 – never think you ’re good enough , always try harder			1
that ’s why i want to be bigger than @entity21			1
never accept being second best			2
‘ i was in his shadow as a kid			1
' people said , “ he ’s @entity86 ’s cousin ” , rather than seeing me as my own person			1
i used to have “ @entity5 ” on the back of my @entity19 shirt as a kid , but that was because it ’s my name			1
‘ like i say , i have nothing but respect for him , but i ’ve done everything myself			2
no - one has given me a penny and i ’ve never asked for one			2
it ’s the way i want to do it and my way is working pretty well right now			2
’ fate : @entity5 started his boxing career after a chance visit to a gym , aged 11 true @entity104 : @entity5 won bronze at last year ¿ s world championships and is a two - time , two - weight national champ @entity5 ’s boxing story started 12 years ago when the shy 11 - year - old wanted to understand the fuss stirred up by one of his classmates			1
‘ i liked athletics and football , ’ he says			0
‘ i was a striker but had two left feet			0
‘ there was a lad in my class who was a boxer and he always used to talk about it			2
one day , when i was about 11 , he said to come down the gym so i did , just for something to do			0
‘ i went down there and he would ask if i wanted a spar			0
i was quite scared so i ’d just say , “ no i ’m happy hitting the bag ”			0
then one day i sparred him and as soon as i hit him i dropped him			0
‘ it was probably my third trip to the gym			0
the other lad had been there six years - he did n’t come back			0
‘ there was an old fella at the gym , dead now , @entity21 rest his soul , called @entity135			1
he always used to say , “ you ’re the best we ’ve ever seen ”			0
i did n’t believe him , but he ’d say , “ you ’ll box for @entity7 one day ”			1
’ hard hitter : 46 of @entity5 's 130 career wins have come by way of knockout high praise : @entity48 has told @entity5 he has the makings of a champion @entity5 boxed for @entity7 within two years			1
he has since won a bronze medal at last year ’s world championships and is a two - time , two - weight national champion			1
his eyes are fixed on @entity37 and in the back of his mind is the @entity152 in two years , where he hopes to make up for lost time			0
‘ i should have gone to 2012 and i would have won a medal , ’ he says			0
‘ i broke my nose just before qualifying and did n’t end up going			0
@entity157 went and won silver			0
‘ i know i can beat @entity157			0
but that ’s in the past			0
i ca n’t say what will happen in the future but i will work harder than anyone in this sport for my future			0
‘ when i sparred with @entity48 , i took his shots and landed some too			1
i know what i can do			0
i want that gold at the @entity169 , then i want one at the @entity152			0
then i ’ll go to the pros and knock people out			0
i want a world title			2
’ it ’s a tall list and a big shadow			2
these games will go some way to showing how far @entity5 can go in tackling both			1
@entity178 and @entity179 will always be remembered for winning the @entity180 at @entity181 in 1983 , but his son is a fine sportsman in his own right			0
@entity184 was drafted by the @entity185 in the @entity186 in 2007 and @entity179 ’s father @entity187 was a professional footballer who played for @entity188			2
not a bad sporting family			0
@entity192 and @entity191 legendary tennis star won an incredible 39 @entity194 titles across singles and doubles , but she was born @entity192			0
her younger brother @entity197 was a baseball pitcher for the @entity198			0
@entity199 and @entity200 is the 1936 olympian you have n’t heard of			0
he won silver in the 200m behind the legendary @entity206 while his younger brother @entity207 broke the colour code in baseball , becoming the first black man to play in the @entity211 .			0

@entity5 will box for @entity7 at the @entity9
his cousin @entity21 was a renowned @entity217 footballer playing for clubs *including* @entity19 , @entity219 and @entity220
@entity48 told @entity5 he had the makings of a world champion
