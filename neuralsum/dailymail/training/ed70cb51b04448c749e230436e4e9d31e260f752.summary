' he loves fast ground and conditions at @entity4 do n't look like they will suit			2
it 's disappointing for us , and champions day , that he wo n't be running but we have to do what 's best for the horse			0
' the @entity12 race looks spot on for him , even more so now as the favourite ( @entity44 ) wo n't be running , so we will go there instead			2
