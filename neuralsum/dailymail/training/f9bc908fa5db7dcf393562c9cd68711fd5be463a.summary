by @entity0 published : 14:08 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 8 january 2013 @entity1 , pictured in 1934 , moved in to a flat opposite the home of @entity3 in 1929 a jew who grew up as a neighbour of @entity1 in @entity6 has written a book detailing life next door to the man who would become one of history 's greatest mass murderers			1
@entity3 , 88 , was five when @entity1 - boss of the rising @entity15 in @entity6 - moved into a palatial flat at @entity17 in 1929 , opposite his family home			1
@entity1 was to keep the apartment there right up until his suicide in april 1945 , but was seldom there after he became chancellor of @entity23 in 1933			1
' it all sounds so cosy when i talk about how i lived in the same road as @entity1 , like it was not a big deal , ' @entity3 said			1
' but it 's so difficult to think that people you saw almost on a daily basis were responsible for turning the world upside down			2
' @entity1 would come to @entity6 at weekends			1
you could tell he was at home because of the cars parked outside			0
i remember seeing him once when i crossed the street with my nanny			0
he looked straight at me , i do n't think he smiled			0
' a few people stopped and shouted ' @entity40 ! ' in response , he raised his hat , like a democratic politician might do before driving off in an awaiting car			0
of course i knew who he was , even as a little boy			0
as chancellor he was dominating the whole scene			0
' on my walk to school i used to admire the gleaming silver @entity52 coup coming and going from the underground garage at the villa of @entity56 , @entity1 's photographer - and employer of @entity1 's mistress , @entity57			1
' the parents of a schoolfriend of mine lived next door to @entity56 , and i remember , probably after the beginning of the @entity65 , @entity1 sitting quietly in a deckchair in the next garden			2
' but there was a sense of menace in the air , which even as a child i could feel			0
in the days before 30 june 1934 , later dubbed the @entity74 , the atmosphere was particularly oppressive			0
@entity1 , pictured leaving the headquarters of the @entity77 party in 1931 , kept the flat in @entity79 until his suicide in 1945 menace in the air : @entity3 describes the period before june 1934 has ' particularly oppressive ' ' at about six o'clock in the morning of that saturday , i became an unwitting witness to preparations for what was to become the worst political massacre in @entity87 since @entity88 's night in 16th - century @entity89			1
' this was when @entity1 eliminated the leadership of the @entity93 - movement because he felt they posed a threat to his power			2
he went on : ' i was woken up by the slamming of car doors , boots clattering on the pavement , and raised voices			0
i craned out of the window , which i was just tall enough to do			0
a long line of cars was parked outside @entity1 's apartment block , and men were rushing in and out of the door			1
' as a historian , i now know that @entity1 had been laying plans to crush the storm troopers			2
their leader , @entity112 , a thick - set , brutish - looking man whom i once remember seeing leaving our local polling station with his mother on his arm , wanted a bigger share of the spoils of office			0
@entity1 feared an @entity122 confrontation with the army generals , whose support he needed			2
persecuted : @entity3 's father was arrested and marched to a concentration camp with other @entity128 prisoners , pictured , in @entity129 on the outside of @entity6 captives : @entity128 ' slave workers ' in striped uniforms are pictured at work in a @entity65 ammunition factory near @entity137 concentration camp during @entity138 ' in the early hours of that saturday morning , @entity1 had torn off the insignia of rank from arrested leaders of the @entity122 and handed them over for execution			1
' then he left for @entity143 , 30 miles south of @entity6 , where he had summoned a meeting of @entity112 and the other sa leaders			2
as i saw , he stopped by his flat , which was en route , and most accounts put his arrival in @entity143 before eight o'clock			0
' he recalls another occasion how his mother once quipped that there was no milk for them on the doorstep one morning ' because the milkman has left so many bottles at the door of the @entity1 residence '			2
@entity3 said there was always a ' screeching of brakes ' and the running of a ' posse of bodyguards ' which indicated when @entity1 was back at his home			1
lucky escape : @entity3 's father managed to get released from the concentration camp in december 1938 and fled the increasingly powerful nazis			1
pictured at the @entity172 in @entity173 , for @entity174 he went on : ' at that stage , seeing him up close did not instil fear			0
perhaps if i had thought about it i might have been scared , but it would n't have done me any good			0
i was just curious to see him there			0
' after the state - sponsored @entity186 - pogrom against the @entity187 in november 1938 , @entity3 's father was arrested and flung into the new concentration camp of @entity137 on the outskirts of @entity6			1
luckily he managed to get released after six weeks and escaped with his family to the @entity174			1
