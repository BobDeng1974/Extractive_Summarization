perfect match : the couple met several years ago while attending a performing arts education program the lawsuit claimed that @entity9 's facility refused because people requiring the services of a group home are by definition incapable of living as married people , and it says @entity10 ' home refused because it believes she does n't have the mental capacity to consent to sex			1
