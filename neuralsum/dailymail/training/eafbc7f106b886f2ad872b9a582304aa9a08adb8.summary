and the winner is ... well , nobody			0
that seemed to be the only result after two @entity5 beauty queens aiming to impress visiting @entity5 prime minister @entity6 both ended up looking like losers			0
one because she hosted the gathering after claiming to be @entity11 @entity10 2014 when she was n't , and the other because , although she was @entity11 @entity10 2014 , the confusion meant she missed out on the opportunity to host the lavish event herself in @entity17 for @entity5 's leader			1
mr @entity6 is the first @entity5 leader to visit @entity10 in 28 years			2
the @entity19 reported that the claws were out between the two battling beauties , @entity22 and @entity23 , after @entity24 multicultural ambassador ms @entity22 hosted a get - together for the @entity5 primer minister as @entity11 @entity10 2014 when the title actually belonged to ms @entity23			1
@entity11 @entity10 2014 , @entity23 , felt hard done by at not being asked to host a special event in @entity17 for visiting @entity5 prime minister @entity6 ms @entity23 said she was devastated at missing out on the opportunity to host the event and ' utterly shocked someone else is claiming to be @entity11 @entity10 '			1
while ms @entity22 said it was all just a simple misunderstanding			0
ms @entity22 said she usually went by her title , @entity34 , and it was the @entity5 media that was at fault for the mix up			1
miss @entity5 @entity10 2013 , @entity22 , blamed the @entity5 media for the misunderstanding ' i would never portray myself as something i am not			1
they got confused and i did n’t want to correct them			0
it was an event for the prime minister , not me , ' she told the @entity19 ' i actually won @entity34 in 2013			0
that ’s what my trophy says			0
' but ms @entity23 said : ' that ( miss @entity10 ) is my title			1
i worked hard for it			0
' ms @entity23 was ' utterly shocked someone else is claiming to be @entity11 @entity10 ' ' i had thought that it would be me who would be asked to host the prime minister , like @entity57 had done in @entity58			2
' i can not believe that someone else can just step in and do it and take this honour from me			0
' miss @entity5 @entity10 organiser @entity61 believed it was unfair ms @entity22 was portrayed as the 2014 titleholder as ms @entity23 now held the crown			1
ms @entity22 said she usually went by the title of @entity34 , although this was disputed ms @entity22 was crowned @entity11 @entity10 in 2013 , but it was claimed she currently held the title of @entity11 @entity69 , not @entity34			2
