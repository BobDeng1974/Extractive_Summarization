by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 created 5:59 pm on 14th september 2011 scandal : @entity4 , seen here in 2006 , has called in the @entity6 after nude photos of her leaked online after they were stolen by a hacker @entity4 has admitted that she took naked photographs of herself which were leaked online			1
the 26 - year - old @entity12 star , who has never appeared fully nude in her movies , has been left humiliated after the explicit pictures were published on a website yesterday			1
the @entity6 has , meanwhile , been called in to investigate how the private photographs were hacked from her mobile phone - and it emerged today that it is closing in on the suspected hacker			1
law enforcement sources told @entity24 authorities are ' honing in ' on the criminal gang , with the identity of one of the ringleaders known to the @entity6			2
@entity4 is the latest victim of the phone - hacking ring thought to be responsible for stealing naked photos and videos from at least 50 female @entity33 celebrities			1
@entity4 's lawyer today issued a statement making it clear that his client took the explicit pictures			1
one of the photographs shows her posing seductively with her top off , while in another her bare behind is visible in a mirror			2
the photographs show wallpaper in the background which matches the design in previously seen pictures from inside her bedroom in @entity48			1
while parts of her body have been exposed for her movie roles , she has never before been seen completely naked			0
' the highly personal and private photographs at issue capture our client self - posing in her own home in a state of undress and / or topless , ' the statement , from lawyer @entity52 , read			2
he also threatened to sue any media outlet which publishes the pictures under copyright laws - the fact that @entity4 holds the rights confirms that she took the pictures and that they are authentic			1
authorities also today confirmed it is looking into the case			0
' the @entity6 is investigating a person or group responsible for a series of cyber intrusions of high - profile figures , ' @entity6 spokeswoman @entity69 said			0
' this would include many devices - could mean a computer , desktop , laptop , @entity80 , cell phone ... intrusions into personal online accounts too			2
' other stars reportedly targeted include actresses @entity85 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , as well as singer @entity90			2
investigation : the actress , pictured here in a campaign for @entity95 , was named earlier this year as one of the 50 victims who had their cell phones or emails compromised by a hacking gang distinctive : the wallpaper shown in the background of the nude pictures appears to match the design on the walls in @entity4 's bedroom , seen here miss @entity109 is likely to have had the photographs stolen by hackers after she tried to email them , experts explained			1
other possibilities include hackers infecting her phone with malicious software , or taking the data from a computer paired to the phone via a virus			2
@entity121 , senior technology consultant at security firm @entity122 , told the @entity123 : ‘ my guess is that , even if these photos were taken on @entity4 's phone , she would then maybe have emailed them to somebody			1
‘ then , either their email got hacked or they were in her sent folder in her online email account - that would be the most natural way			0
’ @entity136 , @entity137 , added : ‘ smartphones such as iphones are only as secure as you make them			0
if you do n’t have a passcode , and leave it lying it around , people can easily steal directly from you , simply by picking it up and sending pictures direct from the phone			2
‘ even if you have a passcode , a determined hacker can often guess – many people use simple combinations such as 1,2,3,4 or repeated digits			0
hackers may have attacked the pc the @entity154 was ‘ paired ’ with and stolen pictures that way			0
sophisticated modern hackers do their research on targets and create tailor - made attacks which play on the victim ’s personal interests			0
these type of hackers tend to be organised criminals who use socially - engineered deceptions to breach computer and smart phone security			0
socially engineered attacks use details culled from sites such as @entity172 to ‘ trick ’ the user into installing software – sending emails that appear to be from a friend , but that install malicious software that let them ‘ control ’ a victim ’s pc			0
if any lesson is learned , it is that if you do n't want explicit pictures spread online , do n't take them and send them around in the first place			0
gossip sites in @entity191 have been speculating as to whether the photographs were meant for her ex-husband , actor @entity195 , or any of the men she has dated since the break - up , who include fellow @entity33 a-lister @entity200			1
bloggers have linked the leaks to a hacking group called @entity204 that has boasted of targeting celebrities			0
@entity207 star @entity206 was also named as a target , with hackers allegedly uncovering picture of a shirtless and ' seductive ' @entity211 on her phone			1
one image is said to show @entity211 wearing pink underwear on his head while there is another reported to be a separate explicit shot of an unidentified male			1
a fourth image is said to show @entity206 in a bath , covered by the tub from the neck down			2
@entity206 and @entity211 , co-stars in the film @entity223 , have long denied rumours of an off - screen romance			1
it is not clear if the @entity4 and @entity206 incidents are related			1
celebrity website @entity24 said @entity4 had called in the @entity6 as a ' criminal act ' had been committed			2
