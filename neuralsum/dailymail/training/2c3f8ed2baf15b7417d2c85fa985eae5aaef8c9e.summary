by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 felt regret and disappointment as he watched @entity6 crash out of the @entity7 to @entity8			1
yet , by his own admission , there was no real surprise			2
the former @entity13 assistant manager resigned and returned to @entity14 in april amid concerns the plc board were loathe to invest large sums on new players			1
after two years of delivering @entity7 football , failure at the third time of asking was likely to end as most managerial reigns do			1
end of an era : @entity2 with former manager @entity25 , prior to the pair leaving @entity6 this year training day : @entity2 takes charge of a training session in may , soon after he 'd announced he was leaving ‘ it ’s important for @entity6 to play and be in the @entity7 , ’ @entity2 told @entity30			1
‘ but i felt a few months ago that this might happen because there probably would n’t be much investment in the team			2
‘ there was a big risk for us as a management team that we would n’t be able to take the team to the @entity7 for a third time running			1
and that wouldn ’ t have looked too good for us			2
winner : @entity8 's @entity44 scored to send @entity6 crashing out of the @entity7 on tuesday ‘ because , as well as working with the club and working with the players , you must also keep an eye on what is best for you			1
‘ and that ’s why leaving was n’t really the hardest decision of my life that i had to take			0
i definitely made the right decision			0
’ like his boss @entity25 , @entity2 saw the @entity7 exit coming and jumped before he was pushed			1
the former defender is currently playing golf , spending time with the family and waiting for the phone to ring			0
by his own admission , his levels of boredom grow by the day			0
yet the events of tuesday night offered some form of vindication			2
in the aftermath of defeat to a modest @entity8 team , around 200 supporters gathered on the club ’s shiny new @entity72			1
‘ @entity74 ’ summoned up memories of the @entity77 era			0
and for @entity6 , the levels of dissent are now a problem			1
after successive defeats to modest @entity84 and @entity8 teams , there is little appetite for @entity87 football			1
furious : @entity6 fans protested after their side were knocked out of the @entity7 by @entity8 that could change after thursday ’s draw when @entity6 could be paired with one of the top seeds from a group featuring @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
from pot three , they could be pitted against @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 or @entity105			0
amongst the lowest seeds , meanwhile , @entity84 offer the prospect of a grudge match			0
@entity110 nights at @entity13 are guaranteed until @entity111 at least			0
yet @entity2 believes the lifting strains of @entity113 could have been a feature of @entity13 once more this season with more substantial reinvestment of profits last recorded at £ 21.3million for the six months up to december 2013			1
‘ the only question you can ask yourself sometimes is what you want for your club ? ’ @entity2 continued			1
club hero : @entity2 was a popular player for @entity6 before becoming the @entity124 ' assistant manager ‘ with no disrespect to the other teams , you are banking on @entity6 winning a league which is not really competitive until you get a strong @entity128 back			1
‘ or unless one of the other teams find a way to be really competitive with @entity6			1
‘ so what do you aim for then ? the @entity7			1
‘ because if you achieve @entity7 football , you know it ’s going to be full houses , you know the crowds are going to be up			1
farewell : @entity25 left @entity6 at the end of the 2013 - 14 season after four successful years at the club ‘ right now , they are not getting full houses playing in the @entity141 league like it was when i was a player there			1
‘ the worst crowd i ever had as a player was 56,800			0
‘ i know these are changed days			0
but that is why it is even more pivotal that you get into the @entity7			1
‘ even if you spend money and get good names , it ’s not a guarantee you will definitely make it into the @entity7			1
there is no such thing			0
but it gives you a better chance			0
‘ and at least then you show intent to the supporters that you are ready to really , really go for it			0
’ how much @entity6 would have to spend to compete in the @entity7 is the question			1
a £ 5m striker would have offered no cast - iron guarantees			2
slowly stagnating in a one - team @entity165 , however , @entity2 craved an injection of quality			1
under pressure : @entity169 has made a poor start as @entity6 manager and is feeling the heat already there was no prospect of a £ 12m deal for @entity176 or spending £ 11m on @entity177			1
with the broadcasting revenues in @entity141 , it was out of the question			0
defying the loss of key players such as @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 to lead the team to the @entity7 two years in a row , however , there was a feeling that the club ’s transfer policy could be less rigid when the need arose			1
‘ we knew inside that there was never really a great chance the club would invest very much , ’ added @entity2			1
‘ in fairness , you can see why			0
‘ they have to look after the finances of the club and they have made quite a good job of it in the last few years			0
‘ but they did that with the help of us bringing @entity7 football and @entity7 money in			1
and all we wanted was to make the team stronger			0
‘ i think we should have had a bit more credit for what we did at @entity6			2
because in four years we might have won a trophy or so more , but we did really well by taking the club to the @entity7 twice			2
‘ that ’s something we are very proud of			0
’ @entity87 beckons : @entity6 's defeat to @entity8 means they 'll play in the unfaniced competition this season @entity2 and @entity25 anticipated the sale of @entity222			1
there was concern that @entity225 might follow suit			0
comments from the @entity229 defender yesterday suggest he still might			0
‘ we all agree in management that if you have a team and you win trophies then you want to make that team even stronger , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ you want to make it even better			0
that ’s how it should be			0
‘ but we felt that this simply was n’t going to happen			0
‘ we could see last year that we needed some reinforcements			0
‘ that ’s not criticising the team we had because we were quite happy with the lads			0
we wanted to take another step and make the team even stronger to make sure we could keep bringing @entity7 football to the club			2
both for ourselves and for the club , as well			0
and we just could n’t see that happening			0
’ they may not have been alone in that			0
when @entity25 followed @entity2 ’s lead by resigning , @entity6 approached @entity253 – then @entity254 - before settling for @entity169 as manager			1
in the first real indication that @entity253 had concerns over the budget available , @entity2 revealed : ‘ obviously i spoke to @entity253 and i know that @entity253 spoke to @entity25 as well			2
hero : club legend @entity253 was approached for the @entity6 manager 's job this summer but turned it down ‘ we all played together , so that ’s natural			1
‘ he was obviously proud that @entity6 were asking him the question , but you know @entity253			2
‘ he is a very stubborn man and he decided to really show the @entity14 public that he could stay in the top flight with a small club like @entity269			2
‘ but it was at the back of his head i think that there was no @entity128 there and he might lose a wee bit of the competitive edge he was used to at @entity6			2
‘ and , of course , we were struggling a bit with the board not really being ready to spend – and maybe that was in the back of his mind , as well			2
‘ maybe he was thinking , “ this is not the right time ”			0
but in the future , i can definitely see @entity253 being @entity6 manager one day			2
’ in contrast with @entity169 , @entity253 appears to have dodged a speeding bullet			0
the @entity6 board will do well to do the same in the weeks ahead .			1

@entity2 said he was disappointed but not surprised by @entity6 's defeat to @entity8
@entity6 lost 1 - 0 on tuesday in the @entity7 *qualifier* , and will now play in the @entity87
the @entity14 resigned in april because of a lack of investment from the board
after the @entity8 defeat , fans gathered to demand the board 's resignation
