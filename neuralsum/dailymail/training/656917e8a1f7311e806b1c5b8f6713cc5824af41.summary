landing a delicate rover on a hostile planet can be tricky at the best of times			0
but what if you could bounce the rover on the surface , in a similar way to dropping a ball , without having to worry about damage ? that ’s what @entity10 and @entity11 at @entity12 are attempting to find out through their design of a shape - shifting robotic exoskeleton , dubbed the @entity16			1
this spherical structure might be able to land without assistance , absorbing most of the shock of impact itself the @entity16 ’s spherical structure can land without any help , absorbing the shock of impact and saving weight that would otherwise be taken up by parachutes and impact balloons			1
it can also use its ball - like structure to roll around without wheels once on the surface , propelling itself forward by shortening and lengthening the cables that connect its rigid components			1
these same cables can be used to pull back parts of the robot , so that science instruments at the centre may be exposed and used			0
a concept drawing of the mission , where many @entity45 could be deployed and bounce to a landing before moving and exploring the surface the robot could be collapsed to a very compact configuration for launch			1
once it reaches @entity52 , it would open and drop to the surface			1
the @entity16 ’s spherical structure can land without any help , absorbing most of the shock of impact and saving weight needed for more complex landing gear			1
it can use this same ball - like structure to roll around without wheels , propelling itself forward by shortening and lengthening the cables that connect its rigid components			2
these same cables could be used to pull back parts of the robot , so that science instruments at the centre could be used			0
the design is a radical departure from the rovers currently in service , such as @entity70 , which use more traditional rigid robots			0
the @entity16 , however , relies on something known as ‘ tensegrity ’ which means it ’s composed entirely of interlocking rods and cables			1
@entity12 describes tensegrities as counter-intuitive tension structures with no rigid connections but which are ‘ uniquely robust , light - weight , and deployable ’			2
there is no single point of failure in a tensegrity robot and no axles or hinges have to be strengthened			0
instead , the force of an impact is diffused over multiple areas on the robot			0
these unusual structures are hard to control traditionally so researchers are experimenting with controlling them using machine learning algorithms and neuroscience inspired controls known as ‘ @entity95 ’			0
mr @entity11 told @entity96 of @entity97 that that they 'd have to invent new ways to handle controls so the robot will move smoothly and efficiently			0
‘ this is so new that if you can do anything more than a twitching dead thing you ’re really ahead of the curve , ’ he said			0
the design could be used for a potential mission to @entity108 's @entity52			1
swince the robot collapses into a smaller shape , scientists could pack a number of units into one spacecraft and study more of the moon 's surface			2
the space agency believes a @entity16 could fall from more than 62 miles above @entity52 without being damaged			1
any interplanetary expedition is still years away , but the team has been awarded a grant from @entity12 to continue their work			2
video : a demonstration of the @entity16 ideally teams of dozens or even hundreds of small , collapsible robots , weighing only a few kilograms a piece , will be conveniently packed during launch and would reliably separate and unpack at their destination			0

@entity16 ’s spherical design absorbs the shock of impact on landing
it can roll on the surface and propel itself forward by changing its shape
@entity12 claim a @entity16 could fall from 62 miles above @entity52 without being damaged
