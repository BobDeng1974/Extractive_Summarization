@entity1 researchers have created the ' new black ' of the science world - and it is being dubbed super black			2
the material absorbs all but 0.035 per cent of light , a new world record , and is so dark the human eye struggles to discern its shape and dimension , giving the appearance of a black hole			1
named @entity14 , or super black , it also conducts heat seven and half times more effectively than copper , and is ten times stronger than steel			2
it is created by @entity21 using carbon nanotubes , which are 10,000 thinner than human hair and so miniscule that light can not get in but can pass into the gaps in between			2
@entity1 scientists have created a material which absorbs all but 0.035 per cent of light , a new world record , and is so dark the human eye struggles to discern what it is that it is seeing , giving the appearance of a black hole named @entity14 , or super black , it also conducts heat seven and half times more effectively than copper , and is ten times stronger than steel most of the light is then absorbed as it bounces around , the @entity34 reports , creating the illusion of a black hole			1
it has been grown on sheets of aluminium foil which can be seen in pictures released by the company			0
while the foil is crinkled and uneven , the surface covered by @entity43 appears completely smooth because of its light absorbing property			0
the super black material has been developed for use in astronomical cameras , telescopes and infrared scanning systems and will be launched at the @entity51 this week			0
it is created by @entity21 using carbon nanotubes , which are 10,000 thinner than human hair and so miniscule that light can not get in but it can pass into the gaps in between @entity58 , chief technology officer of @entity21 , said : ' @entity14 is a major breakthrough by @entity1 industry in the application of nanotechnology to optical instrumentation			1
' for example , it reduces stray - light , improving the ability of sensitive telescopes to see the faintest stars , and allows the use of smaller , lighter sources in space - borne black body calibration systems			0
' its ultra-low reflectance improves the sensitivity of terrestrial , space and air - borne instrumentation			0
' @entity77 , professor of colour science and technology at @entity80 , told the paper : ' these new materials , they are pretty much as black as we can get , almost as close to a black hole as we could imagine			1

@entity14 absorbs all but 0.035 per cent of light , a new world record
it is so dark the human eye struggles to discern its dimensions
the material gives the appearance of a ' black hole ' on all it covers
