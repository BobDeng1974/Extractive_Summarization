@entity0 faces a four - match ban after he was charged with violent conduct by the @entity3 for allegedly elbowing @entity8 in the face during @entity6 ’s defeat at his old club @entity7 on monday night			1
however , @entity7 ’s @entity9 will face no action over an apparent slap on @entity6 defender @entity12 later in the game because referee @entity14 said in his report on tuesday that it was spotted by the match officials at the time			1
@entity14 confirmed that the incident involving @entity0 and @entity8 went unseen , which has enabled the @entity3 to act			1
@entity0 has been charged by the @entity3 for throwing an elbow at @entity8 at @entity20 on monday night @entity0 catches the @entity7 midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism @entity0 clearly threw his arm in the direction of can as @entity6 slumped to defeat can reacts after being hit in the face with @entity0 's flailing arm @entity0 has until 6pm on wednesday to respond to the charge			1
he can either accept it and receive an automatic ban or ask for his case to be heard by a disciplinary commission at 7pm			2
either way , the 22 - year - old will be suspended for four games if found guilty because he has already been sent off once before this season after picking up two yellow cards at @entity39 on his last return to @entity41 in november			2
after the match , @entity0 's former @entity20 team - mate @entity42 criticised him afterwards , and revealed that such flashpoints were not uncommon at the club 's @entity46 training ground when they were there			1
@entity0 took to @entity49 to explain what happened and insisted he would not set out to hurt an opponent ' it 's absolute madness , ' said @entity42			1
' you 'd see this two or three times a week in training			0
he has bags of ability , @entity0 , but unfortunately he can do stuff like that too			2
' @entity0 , who joined @entity6 from @entity7 for £ 5million last year , had earlier pleaded his innocence on @entity49 by saying that the elbow was unintentional and he had apologised to @entity64			1
he wrote : ‘ just wan na say did n’t intentionally elbow emre can was just trying to get my arm across to get round him and it ’s come off as i 'm trying to hurt another play and i can assure you that , that is n’t the case			0
and i had apologised to emre can for catching him			0
’ @entity0 capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for @entity7 's fourth @entity6 boss @entity74 also defended @entity0 , saying : ‘ i spoke to @entity0 on the way home and he said his intention was not to catch the player at all			1
he said the player was tugging on him and he was just trying to push him away			0
‘ i do n’t think it was an intentional elbow at all and the referee was perfectly placed			0
no - one had a better view of the incident than him			0
he felt it did n’t warrant any more action and the game went on			0
’ @entity42 's fellow @entity90 pundit @entity89 claimed that the offence was worse than the one that earned @entity7 's @entity94 a straight red card against @entity96 earlier this month			1
the 22 - year - old watches as his headers finds the back of the net at @entity20 ' @entity74 has already talked about the lack of discipline from @entity0 ahead of this game and this just proves it , ' said @entity89			1
' when you first see it you ca n't really see it but on second viewing it is not pretty at all			0
' the problem is the referee can not put in his report that he has n't seen that because he is never going to have a better view of it than he has there			0
it 's not as bad as the @entity119 one ( elbow on @entity39 's @entity121 ) but it is worse than the @entity94 one we saw a few weeks ago			2
' ' he has seen it ( the @entity0 incident )			2
there 's no way he ca n't have not seen it			0
15 years ago you would have got a yellow card most , or maybe not even a yellow card , but he is a lucky boy because he throws the arm out			0
' @entity14 needs to look at that freeze because he can not say he has not seen that arm come out and hit him if he wants any credibility in the game			0
' @entity9 will not face any action after pushing @entity12 in the face			1
