a map of the riskiest destinations for contracting an illness or being involved in an accident has been published by health organisation @entity4			1
the @entity5 2015 ranks destinations in five categories , in order to help companies and travellers understand the risks they face in different countries when getting medical treatment			1
categories include low risk , medium risk , high risk and extreme risk , with another category for large , rapidly developing countries			1
the @entity22 map shows the countries where healthcare is high quality and the places where travellers are at risk while @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 are understandably among the countries offering the highest levels of medical care , there are some popular holiday destinations where travellers are at risk			1
@entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 are among the holiday hotspots declared as ' medium risk ' on the map , with some risk of diseases and emergency medical care described as ' adequate '			1
however , holidaymakers are recommended to search out quality medical providers and informed that in some severe cases they may need to be evacuated to another country			2
the key to the map is a colour - coded chart showing the quality of medical healthcare available and the options available to travellers : @entity58 large rapidly developing countries selected group of large rapidly developing countries where there is a vast difference between the high quality medical care available in major cities and low levels of care generally available throughout the rest of the country			1
medical assistance : in major cities : selection of quality providers			2
elsewhere : selection of best care available			0
transfer to a higher quality facility			0
moderate and sever illness / injury may require evacuations green low risk international standard of care throughout			2
all tertiary - level , specialist and sub-specialist care widely available			0
high - quality emergency and dental services and a wide range of quality prescription drugs available			2
low risk of infecyious diseases medical assistance : medical referral			2
assistance with language and cultural differences			0
evacuation rarely required yellow medium risk high or international standard available from selected providers ; other providers offer a lower standard of care			1
adequate emergency services and dental care usually available			2
some risk of water - borne diseases			2
diseases such as malaria and dengue fever may be present			0
medical assistance : selection of quality providers			2
@entity117 illness / injury may require evacuations			0
@entity119 high risk countries with limited medical capabilities			1
emergency services and dental care may be basic			0
access to quality prescription drugs may be limited and , in some cases , counterfeiting and / or improper storage of drugs is an issue			0
serious infectious diseases such as typhoid , cholera , dengue fever and malaria may pose a threat			0
medical assistance : selection of best care available case monitoring			0
transfer to a higher quality facility			0
any condition requiring hospitalisation may require international evacuation			0
@entity145 extreme risk countries where healthcare is almost non-existent or severely over-taxed			1
there may be no emergency or dental services , quality prescription drugs are usually not available			0
there is a high risk of food or water - borne infections			1
serious infectious diseases such as dengue , malaria , typhoid and cholera are common			0
medical assistance : selection of best care available			0
transfer to a higher quality facility			0
all but minor health issues may require international evacuation			0
high - risk countries that are favourite holiday destinations include @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 , with tourists recommended to transfer to a high - quality facility if they are taken ill and warned that any hospitalisation may result in an international evacuation			1
countries deemed high risk have limited medical capabilities and access to prescription drugs , and have a risk of serious infectious diseases such as cholera , typhoid or dengue fever			1
the most crisis - hit countries include many @entity190 nations as well as @entity191 and @entity192 as well as areas that have been affected by natural disasters in recent years such as @entity195			1
@entity4 assessed the assessed various factors including the quality of medical and dental care , access to prescription drugs , prevalence of infectious diseases and cultural , administrative and language barriers			1
according to the map , the low - risk countries , with high - quality emergency health and dental care , a range of prescription drugs available and low risk of infectious disease include the @entity210 , @entity31 , @entity211 , @entity212 , the @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and the rest of western @entity29			1
however , the overall level of healthcare offered in countries around the world reiterates the importance of travel insurance			2
for tourists who fall ill or are injured in countries where it is recommended they seek the highest - quality healthcare centres for treatment , medical costs can soon soar			1
however , with health insurers , worried holidaymakers can contact emergency helplines to find the best available medical centre available to them as part of their policy			2
low - risk countries include the @entity210 , @entity213 , @entity31 and @entity212 , while extreme - risk countries include @entity191 , @entity237 , @entity192 and @entity195 a new category was included on the map this year to highlight the disparity of care available in ' large rapidly developing countries ' , such as @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 , where access to quality healthcare differs hugely between cities and more rural outposts			1
@entity250 , medical director , @entity252 at @entity4 said : ' @entity254 data shows that over 40 per cent of our medical cases occur in countries classed as ' high ' or ' @entity259 ' risk			1
' this is a significant increase from less than 25 per cent in 2010			0
preparation of travellers , including a risk assessment , education and health check programme for staff , will reduce the need for intervention after travel			0
a doctor treats a baby in a paediatric ward in @entity191 , which is an extreme - risk country on the 2015 healthcare map ' this is especially important for people travelling to high and extreme risk countries			1
@entity5 2015 is just one of the many tools that can help organisations plan and prepare for operations around the world			0
' @entity4 works as a health security risk services company and has 53 clinics worldwide , 40 of which operate in areas where there are gaps in quality of medical care .			1

@entity4 published @entity290 showing the standard of healthcare around the world
*outlines* which countries have the best and worst emergency healthcare
@entity212 , @entity299 , @entity300 , the @entity213 and @entity210 among best countries for medical treatment
popular holiday spots from @entity40 to @entity171 , @entity38 and @entity37 among countries with ' medium ' or ' high ' risk
@entity192 , @entity309 , @entity191 and @entity237 are *unsurprisingly* the countries with the worst healthcare
