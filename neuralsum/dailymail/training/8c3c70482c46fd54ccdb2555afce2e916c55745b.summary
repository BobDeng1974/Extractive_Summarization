it was posted on @entity16 under the heading : ‘ lifting the lid on austerity @entity20 reveals a perfect storm – and it ’s forcing more and more people into poverty ’			2

mr @entity32 said yesterday : ‘ the fact that the @entity39 have published this conclusion after a very long period of deliberation shows how seriously they took what was very clearly a breach by @entity0			2

’ under charity law , charities have to refrain from political campaigning and remain neutral			0
in a three - page report published yesterday , the @entity39 said : ‘ we considered that the text of the tweet and the embedded picture , gave rise to speculation and varying perceptions about the tweet ’s purpose , leading to complaints			0
