by @entity0 @entity3 does not draw a salary for her work at the @entity6 , ' a source close to @entity2 ' divulged yesterday , nor does the organization pay the salaries of @entity3 's entourage			1
the disclosure comes as a @entity12 opposition research outfit pressures the @entity6 to provide assurances that it is not directly or indirectly helping to lay the groundwork for @entity3 's presumed 2016 presidential run			1
@entity3 's staff consists of approximately seven aides , including @entity19 – disgraced former congressman @entity21 's wife – who are reportedly responsible for managing her paid speaking gigs and helping her promote her memoir @entity24 , which came out last month			2
' the secretary 's personal staff is paid for by her personally , ' the source said			0
it 's common practice for campaign aides to be rewarded with government positions after a job well done			0
and it 's no surprise the @entity53 would hire trusted aides to manage their nonprofit organization			0
but @entity12 political groups like @entity57 and the @entity58 are questioning the whether foundation staff are gearing up to join @entity3 's 2016 presidential campaign			1
the @entity6 website lists the names and biographies of 19 staffers on the foundation 's leadership team , of whom half acknowledge their political backgrounds			1
in their bios , five members of the leadership team mention working on @entity3 's failed presidential campaign , three others say they 've worked for @entity3 or @entity74 in some other capacity when the @entity53 served as elected officials and another employee acknowledges working for @entity78			1
@entity57 wants the @entity6 to make public a full list of staff or paid consultants who worked for the @entity2 in the past or have worked for @entity78 or the @entity82 and for both @entity3 and @entity74 to come clean about which speaking fees they 've donated to the @entity6 in 2013 and 2014			1
@entity3 recently said she donates all the money given to her by universities for appearances but has provided no proof to substantiate her claim			0
@entity57 also requested a list of travel expenses for @entity74 , @entity3 and @entity32 and a document outlining the costs for the @entity94			0
a 2013 review of the @entity6 's ax documents completed by the @entity97 found that the organization spent $ 50 million throughout the previous decade on travel , and @entity57 is curious to know how much of that went toward personal travel for the @entity2 family			2
in an email to reporters on monday , @entity57 executive director @entity103 said @entity3 's assertion that she passes on checks from universities to the foundation opened ' the door to questions about just how that foundation is spending money			2
' @entity2 will need as much staff support as she can get if she runs for president , in part to deflect and diffuse controversies -- like the 2012 @entity119 terror attack -- that continue to dog her ' in the past , the @entity6 has spent millions on opulent travel and lodging for her family , financed glitzy , celebrity - fueled donor events and paid key @entity82 aides who would likely play key roles in her presidential campaign , ' he said			2
' for @entity129 to credibly believe these speaking fees are being donated to charitable endeavors , the foundation must be transparent about how and where it has spent its millions since @entity3 joined last year			1
' @entity57 's concerns that the @entity6 may be serving as the unofficial home for @entity3 's unannounced presidential campaign stem from a 2011 internal review of the foundation that cited concerns about perceived and real conflicts of interest within the organization 's hierarchy			1
the @entity143 also points to the review and a 2013 article from the @entity146 that suggested that foundation could ' serve as a base for [ @entity3 ] to home in on issues and to build up a stable of trusted staff members who could form the core of a political campaign ' as evidence that its charges are not unfounded			0
the same @entity146 article notes that @entity3 brought a staff of approximately seven people with her to the foundation when she left the @entity35 last year , including @entity19 , who has been spotted with @entity3 frequently throughout her @entity24 book tour			0
a spokesman for @entity162 confirmed to the @entity146 on wednesday that the former first daughter is not paid by the @entity6 either , despite holding the role of vice chair and contributing a significant amount of time to helping manage her family 's charity			0
@entity2 is yet to disclose personally or through a representative whether he receives a paycheck from the organization on top of the millions he earns annually in speaking fees .			0
