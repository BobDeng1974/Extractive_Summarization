warning : @entity1 fans travelling to next summer 's @entity2 in @entity3 have been warned to protect themselves against a terrifying holiday bug which can kill @entity18 is endemic in over 100 countries with 100 million people struck down annually			2
professor @entity21 , an infectious diseases expert , has called on the @entity3 authorities to take action to reduce the number of mosquitoes before over half a million people flock in from across the globe			0
he said : ' @entity18 could be a significant problem in some of the tournament locations and preventative measures are needed			0
' @entity6 , the @entity3 authorities and the @entity2 sponsors must use their influence and experience to communicate the risk			1
' @entity34 : @entity1 sealed their place in @entity3 last month but now fans are being warned about mosquito - borne dengue fever although it can not be passed from human to human a non-infected insect that bites someone with dengue then becomes a carrier - passing the disease to the next person it targets			1
it 's transmitted by urban , day - biting @entity49 mosquitoes which makes it a particular problem in towns and cities			1
infected visitors can also inadvertently bring home the disease to their native country			0
professor @entity21 and colleagues explored the risk to football fans by examining maps of the distribution of dengue in @entity3 and records of its seasonal variation at key sites			2
@entity18 is a viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms , from mild flu - like illness to more serious illnesses including rashes and bone pain			1
@entity75 and potentially deadly forms develop in around 5 percent of patients			2
@entity18 usually clears up by itself within around 1 - 2 weeks			2
there are no specific medications to treat the disease , but symptoms can be managed by taking paracetamol , drinking plenty of fluids and resting			2
the study published in @entity86 showed outbreaks will be highest when matches are played in @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 - all in the north east of the country			2
@entity1 will find out where they will initially be based when the draw for the group stages takes place on 6 december			0
professor @entity21 , of @entity98 , said : ' i do n't want to dissuade anyone from going to the @entity2 - nor to single out @entity3 - which is one of more than 100 countries battling dengue worldwide			1
' my aim is to inform unwary spectators about the risk and how they can protect themselves			0
' despite being a tropical disease cases have been reported in @entity108 and @entity109			0
after it struck the island of @entity112 last year the @entity110 warned of a future @entity114 outbreak			0
there is no vaccine so people heading out next summer should pack plenty of light - coloured long trousers and long - sleeved shirts along with mosquito - repellant sprays for exposed areas of skin			1
there is no vaccine so people heading out next summer should pack plenty of light - coloured long trousers and long - sleeved shirts along with mosquito - repellant sprays for exposed areas of skin professor @entity21 said : ' the @entity3 authorities should implement aggressive vector control in april and may - particularly around the northern stadiums - to decrease the number of dengue - transmitting mosquitoes			1
' they can target adult @entity49 mosquitoes through fogging - the use of aerosol formulations of insecticides that disperse efficiently - and can interrupt breeding by clearing sites at which the mosquitoes lay their eggs - water collected in discarded rubbish for example			0
' there are no vaccines or drugs against dengue but an individual will never contract dengue if they do not get bitten by an infected mosquito in the first place			1
so avoiding mosquito bites is the best precaution			0
' select accomodation with screened windows and doors and air conditioning ; use insecticides indoors ; wear clothing that covers the arms and legs especially during early morning and late afternoon when the chance of being bitten is greatest ; and apply insect repellant to clothing and exposed skin			0
' @entity1 fans have already snapped up more than 28,000 match tickets for @entity3 - even before they know where the team will be playing			0
so keen are they to witness glory in june and july they are only behind the host country themselves , the @entity173 and @entity174 in the global rush - despite basic travel packages costing a whopping Â£ 7,000			1
