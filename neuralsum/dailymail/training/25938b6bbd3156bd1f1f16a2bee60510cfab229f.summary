mr @entity10 says he decided to spruce up an ‘ eyesore ’ patch of land at the entrance to his premises after a search to find out who owned it proved fruitless			1
clash : @entity10 ( right ) has been ordered to vacate a patch of land outside his recycling centre by staff at landowner and banker @entity15 's ( left ) country estate the businessman claimed he spent £ 10,000 to clear the 0.3 acre site at @entity32 , @entity33 , and now uses it to park his trailers and give out free fire wood to the local community			1

dispute : the legal wrangle centres around a patch of land at the entrance to mr @entity10 's premises which he is currently using to park his trucks and give out free wood to the local community investment : mr @entity10 claims he spent around £ 10,000 clearing the site and that if he is removed from the land it would have a significant effect on his business mr @entity10 , 67 , said : ' we have spent a lot of time and money clearing the site which was previously a dumping ground			1
' we checked with the registers of @entity71 and could n’t find a clean title for the land so we decided to clear it ourselves			2
' i had n’t heard anything for a couple of years and then this lawyer ’s letter arrived out of the blue telling us to clear the land within seven days			2
the letter ordering mr @entity10 off the land ' we use the site to park trailers and to dispense fire wood for free to the local community , which is much appreciated in an area of high unemployment			1
' if we are removed from the land we would have nowhere to park the trailers and it would have a significant effect on our business			2
' @entity15 ’s estate have teamed up with the @entity44 estate and are now threatening to take us to court , it ’s ridiculous			0
' the site is of absoultely no use to them but they seem hell - bent on removing us			0

last night ( fri ) , @entity117 , the factor of @entity47 and @entity48 , said : ' the site was clear and unobstructed when mr @entity10 took it over			1
' it was previously unclear if ourselves or the @entity44 estate owned the land but we are now both registered as joint owners			2
' we have offered in the past to lease the land to mr @entity10 but he has not taken up our offer			1
' we felt that our only recourse was to take legal action			0
