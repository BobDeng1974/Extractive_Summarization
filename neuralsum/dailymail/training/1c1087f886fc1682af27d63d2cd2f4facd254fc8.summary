by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 06:49 est , 18 september 2013 a man whose hand swelled and turned black and yellow after a spider bit him discovered he had been the victim of the @entity7 's most venomous spider - but only when he posted a picture of it on @entity10 five weeks later			1
@entity11 said his had was still ' swollen like a balloon ' after what turned out to be a false widow spider - the @entity7 cousin of the lethal black widow - bit him while he was asleep at his home in @entity18 , @entity19			1
he had blood tests and x-rays at both @entity22 in @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity25 , but doctors could not figure out what was wrong with his hand			2
venomous : @entity11 's hand swelled up after he was bitten by the false black widow spider it was only when mr @entity11 put a photo online of a spider online that friends recognised the dangerous animal			1
mr @entity11 made the connection between the spider and his swollen hand and captured the culprit in a pot to take with him to @entity42 in @entity19			1
' i said i ’m going to let this spider go in your office and if it bites you i ’m going to follow you to where you get it sorted , ' he said			2
' eventually they took it pretty seriously			0
' doctors gave him a course of the antibiotic flucloxacillin and within days , the swelling reduced and the pain disappeared			2
the 2in - long spider , known by experts as @entity59 or ' noble false widow ' , unleashes a powerful venom when provoked which can kill those who are allergic to it			1
wound : mr @entity11 's finger remained swollen for weeks and he visited three hospitals for tests and x-rays mr @entity11 , a tattooist , explained he only realised he ’d been attacked by a spider when he posted a picture online			1
he said : ' i i put a picture of the spider on @entity10 saying , " have i found a new species ? " ' within minutes people replied saying " it is dangerous , do n’t touch it			0
" ' i went back to the doctor and he did n’t believe me			0
he said , " what website did you get that ( picture ) off ? " ' i said it was taken in my kitchen			0
he went online and i saw his face drop			0
' he said , " you could be right about this			0
it could be a spider bite			1
" ' no deaths have ever been confirmed in the @entity7 from a false widow spider bite			1
it is thought their numbers have increased in recent years due to milder winters and warmer summers that some put down to global warming			1
@entity99 conservation ecologist @entity98 said : ' reports from false widow spider bites have included symptoms like chest pains and a swelling and tingling of the bite area , usually the fingers			1
' if bitten then visit @entity108 , do not ring 999			0
' ideally and if possible the spider should be caught in a jar so it can be identified			0
' @entity113 spider expert @entity112 said there have been a lot of sightings of the spiders in recent weeks			2
he said : ' it 's spider season			2
a lot of species mature in the autumn			0
when it ’s hot and humid , we leave our doors and windows open , and that allows the spiders in			0
