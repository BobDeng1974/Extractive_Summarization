by @entity0 published : 15:28 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 19:30 est , 17 april 2013 baggy black t - shirts , vice-like sports bras and a collection of thigh - high mini skirts to re-route male attention southwards			1
i ’ve tried everything to divert the opposite sex from staring at my rather ample chest			1
but no matter what i attempt , i ’ve always been known as @entity11			1
that ’s the thing about having a @entity14 bust : it ’s the first thing people see			1
so , almost inevitably , it becomes your defining characteristic			2
curvy curse : @entity21 hates people staring at her cleavage but more often than not the dubious attention attracted by my bangers / puppies / fun bags — oh yes , i ’ve heard all the ‘ hilarious ’ euphemisms — is entirely unwelcome			1
please do n’t think me po - faced or ‘ ungrateful ’ ( as some of my more petite friends have labelled me ) , but the lascivious stares and lewd comments seem to be on the rise — even in this supposedly politically correct age			1
and i blame the likes of tv presenter @entity35 — who is said to be a size @entity36 — who recently declared : ‘ i do n’t mind people fixating on my cleavage			1
’ the more that ms @entity43 , as she ’s apparently happy to be known , pouts and preens and pretends she ’s fine with the fact her fame revolves around her mammary glands , the more people think it ’s fine to gawp at the rest of us big - breasted girls			1
@entity51 - booby : the tv presenter recently declared , ' i do n't mind people fixating on my cleavage ' just the other day , i encountered a man in a bar who could n’t peel his eyes away from my cleavage : ‘ @entity57 ! i mean wow ! seriously — wow ! ’ i wanted to shout : ‘ i do have an entire body — not to mention a brain — you know ! ’ but , of course , i did n’t say anything			2
unlike any other part of your anatomy , when the joke ’s about your heaving bosom , you ’re simply supposed to laugh along			2
despite @entity35 ’s declarations to the contrary , a sizeable bust quickly becomes the bane of your @entity73 apart from the physical discomfort of lumbering around a 9lb bosom ( yes , i once weighed them ) , i ca n’t go for a run without teenagers shouting ‘ @entity80 , bouncy ! ’ and am yet to speak to a man who has been able to meet my gaze for any length of time			1
' i 'm sure there are many women who would imagine such attention boosts your confidence , but in reality it 's uncomfortable ' all this has made me — like everyone else — utterly obsessed with my boobs			1
if only they were smaller , i muse , i could for once look elegant in a dainty bikini			2
it was n’t until i was 14 that my breasts began to grow out of all proportion			2
those early days of shopping for bras left mental scars , with me sobbing ‘ i hate my boobs ’ to my mum			1
two - inch - wide straps carved pink grooves into my shoulders and the cups struggled to contain my curves			2
‘ we all love you as you are , ’ mum would say			2
‘ try not to worry			2
’ she meant well , but as a neat b - cup , how could she ever understand my trauma ? i ’m 35 , but when i was a teenager more generous sizes were n’t readily available			2
i was consigned to an old ladies ’s lingerie store near where we lived in @entity119 , @entity120 , which only emphasised my freakishness			2
i ’d go home and prod my breasts in front of the mirror			2
they were n’t round and voluptuous : they were more teardrop - shaped and droopy			0
bane of my life : @entity0 believes her 34f boobs mean she can never look elegant while she 's had to endure taunts of ' bouncy , bouncy ' when going for a run recently , i flicked through an old diary and was shocked to see that such was my paranoia back then that i ’d drawn a diagram of everything i hated about what i called my ‘ old lady boobs ’			1
and this was before i ’d had to contend with the bewildering reactions of the opposite sex			0
it was n’t until i moved from my girls ’ school to a sixth form college at the age of 16 that i became painfully aware of the rubbernecking and widening eyes that my breasts elicited from hormonal young males			0
that ’s when i started wearing the baggy black t - shirts			0
i ’m sure there are many women who would imagine such attention boosts your confidence , but in reality it ’s uncomfortable , humiliating and you just want to run away and hide			1
so distraught was i with my breasts in my late teens that i visited the doctor to inquire about a reduction			0
my gp warned me such operations come with big risks and suggested that , in time , i might grow to love my breasts			1
after his well - meaning words , i did n’t pursue the idea of a breast reduction , but i continued to torture myself with physical comparisons to my svelte best friend , @entity172			0
size matters the best - selling bra size is @entity175 - that compares to @entity177 in 2010 , according to @entity178 whenever we had sleep - overs , i ’d watch how she slipped effortlessly into her pyjamas			0
when i got changed , my breasts swung from side to side in cumbersome and clumsy unison			0
when i went to university in @entity187 , i found myself gravitating towards other busty girls			0
my housemate ’s cleavage was as eye - popping as mine			0
we endured vulgar taunts about our bosoms , but took comfort in the fact we were not alone			0
i never dressed revealingly for dates when i was young and , even now , i refuse to display my cleavage when meeting potential suitors			0
i just want a man who will love me for me — and that includes my whole body and my brain			0
meanwhile , my nights out in bars and clubs continue to be dominated by vulgar comments about my chest			1
as a woman with a larger - than - life personality , i tend to laugh off such comments			1
but there are times when i go home feeling genuinely upset			0
would these men say anything if i was flat - chested ? or big - bottomed ? i do n't think so			1
thanks to @entity35 and her ilk , curvy women with big boobs are considered to be fair game for ribald comments from strangers			1
as at this time of year , i ’m dreading having to strip down to a bikini on holiday			0
unwelcome attention : @entity228 ' character in mad men flaunts her womanly curves but @entity0 is not proud of hers girls with big busts tend to look like budding porn stars , even if they choose the classiest two - piece on the block ( which will have to employ heavy scaffolding and cost at least £ 50 )			1
the extent to which my god - forsaken breasts put a dampener on everything is best summed up by a recent phone call			0
it was my sister @entity245 , 25 , ringing to tell me she was engaged and she ’d like me to be her matron of honor			0
of course , i congratulated her , but my very first question was : ‘ do i have to wear a strapless bridesmaid ’s dress ? ’ forget inquiries about the venue , the number of guests , how she was feeling — my fears about my figure clouded my reaction to her happy news			0
i admit this makes me feel silly , childish and a bit sad			0
i do wish i could learn to accept my @entity261 , @entity245 is very laid - back and assured me that i could wear whatever made me feel most comfortable			0
so i would say to @entity35 , and all those women who revel in comments about their breasts , to think again and realise that not every big - busted girl is happy to be judged by her boobs alone			1
i , for one , feel better having got that all off my chest .			0

@entity21 admits she hates having big boobs
they attract unwelcome attention
