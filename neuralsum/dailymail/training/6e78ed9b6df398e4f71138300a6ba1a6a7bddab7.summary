human trafficking gangs are getting away with millions of pounds in profits because the police have no incentive to freeze their assets , home secretary @entity0 is warned today			1
@entity6 warn new laws to tackle modern - day slavery do not enough to hit gangmasters ' where it hurts ' by confiscating cash immediately			1
they urge mrs may to follow the example of @entity16 gangster @entity15 who was ' brought down in the 1930s through his finances '			1
home secretary @entity0 says the @entity18 will ensure those involved in the ' disgusting trade ' will be arrested , prosecuted and jailed the @entity18 gets its third reading in the @entity22 today , with the government boasting that it will ensure those involved in the ' disgusting trade ' will be arrested , prosecuted and jailed			1
but amendments to the bill tabled by a cross-party group of mps warn it fails to target the root of the trade in vulnerable people , by seizing profits made by traffickers			1
they argue that profits generated by trafficking gangs can run to million pounds a week in single towns , but police fail to follow the money			1
a major obstacle is said to be rules which mean most of the money which is recouped is taken by the @entity44 , leaving police forces with little incentive to prioritise the funding			1
@entity49 mp @entity48 , who has backed changes to the law with @entity53 mp @entity52 , said : ' for too long , illegal gangmasters have been getting away with keeping their massive profits even on the rare occasion they get caught '			1
in an article for @entity58 he added : ' the police need the ability to freeze the assets of illegal traffickers within the first 24 hours			1
' at present it takes many months and by then offenders have dissipating their assets before they can be confiscated			2
' a further change needed to the @entity67 is for assets that are recovered to be returned - after compensating victims - to the investigating police force and the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) rather than the @entity44			1
' critics warn not enough is done to seize the assets and cash of those involved in trafficking , because police forces are not incentivised to do so he adds : ' the home secretary is to be commended for delivering the @entity79			1
yet only if it tackles organised crime through more effective financial controls will it deliver the operational change that is required			0
' under the @entity67 , the maximum sentence for the most serious offenders is increased from 14 years to life imprisonment			0
those who have a previous conviction for a serious sexual or violent offence face an automatic life sentence			0
ministers say it will also ensure that perpetrators convicted of slavery or trafficking ' face the toughest asset confiscation regime '			0
launching the bill in june , mrs may said : ' modern slavery is an appalling crime that has no place in today ’s society			0
' it is an affront not just to the dignity and humanity of the people crushed by it but to every one of us			0
' @entity110 presents an historic opportunity to get legislation on the statute books specifically targeting the scourge of modern slavery			0
' @entity49 mp @entity48 warned the legislation fails to ' follow the money ' of gangmasters the gangster @entity15 was brought down in the 1930s through his finances , but modern police forces are slow to follow suit when fighting today 's organised criminals			1
the modern slavery @entity124 before @entity126 today is the perfect opportunity to change the law so that those exploiting vulnerable workers can be targeted through their finances			1
for too long , illegal gangmasters have been getting away with keeping their massive profits even on the rare occasion they get caught			2
these profits can run to several million pounds a week in one rural town alone in my farming constituency , according to local police sources			2
the crux of the problem is the speed at which assets are frozen before crooks and their advisors can move them , and the lack of financial incentives for enforcement agencies investigating complex financial arrangements			2
first , the police need the ability to freeze the assets of illegal traffickers within the first 24 hours			1
at present it takes many months and by then offenders have dissipating their assets before they can be confiscated			2
this requires the @entity67 to lower the evidential burden , so that it can be presumed assets have been obtained illegally through trafficking in certain scenarios			2
yet making it quicker and easier to freeze the assets of traffickers is not enough if the incentivises for law enforcement to investigate are not in place			1
a further change needed to the @entity67 is for assets that are recovered to be returned - after compensating victims - to the investigating police force and the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) rather than the @entity44			1
at present there is little incentive for a chief constable under resource pressure to appoint additional financial investigators , if it takes years to recover the money and this is then largely swallowed up by the @entity44			2
the role of supposedly respectable financial advisors to illegal traffickers also needs to be addressed in the @entity67			0
criminal accounts by their nature are profitable			0
too many financial firms hide behind the simple process of filing a suspicious activity report before continuing to trade - and taking their commission			2
so a higher duty of care is needed for financial institutions when arrests are made but prior to a restrain order being granted			0
clearer disclosure requirements are also needed for financial institutions regarding patterns of client activity in known trafficking hot spots - such as a trafficker who has ownership of workers bank cards and makes multiple withdrawals from the same cash point using the same pin but with a multitude of different cards			2
likewise rogue gangmasters are able to make multiple payments into a single bank account which should trigger action by the bank			0
the way that gangmaster ’s pay their workers also needs to change so there is a clearer audit trail - as has recently been introduced for the scrap metal industry			0
at the moment , a farmer may pay a gangmaster for work in cash , in the form of say 15 brown envelopes with £ 150 in them each for each of the workers			0
however , instead of this going to each worker the exploiter will cross off £ 20 for accommodation , £ 30 for travel after they are given the envelope so that what the workers are ending up with is only a fraction of what the farmer thinks he is paying			0
by workers being paid either through electronic transfer or by cheque the power is removed from the hands of the @entity242 and means not only should the worker receive their proper wage , but there is a documented trail of payments for the police to investigate if irregularities are suspected			0
if a rogue gangmaster then wanted to take these wages , they would have to take their workers to a bank or cash point , and take the money directly off them , at which point the police would have a strong case to prosecute them for theft			1
the home secretary is to be commended for delivering the @entity79			0
yet only if it tackles organised crime through more effective financial controls will it deliver the operational change that is required			0
according to the @entity71 , those trafficked to the @entity266 for labour exploitation exceeded those for sexual exploitation for the first time last year			0
it is time to follow the money .			1

call for police forces to keep cash and assets taken from gangmasters
*minsters* insist @entity18 will lock up those in ' disgusting trade '
@entity49 mp @entity48 says tougher law must ' follow the money '
@entity286 *crackdown* to how @entity15 was ' brought down by his finances '
