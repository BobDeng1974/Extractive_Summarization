by @entity0 it was supposed to be a moment of triumph and skill - arms thrown wide in jubilation after an arduous climb			1
but one cyclist 's attempt to show off for the cameras took a turn for the worse as he lost his balance and plunged ingloriously into a grass verge			1
@entity13 , a 36 - year - old it manager was just about to crest @entity14 in @entity16 - part of the 2102 @entity18 road cycling route - when he spotted a photographer and spread his arms wide with a grin			1
look mum , no hands ! @entity13 , 36 , was climbing @entity14 in @entity16 when he made his triumphant - and doomed - gesture pride before a fall : mr @entity13 manages to hold the pose for a brief second - but disaster is looming ... turn for the worse : the it manager 's triumph turns sour as he swerves towards the verge downfall : with no hope of recovery , mr @entity13 begins to fly over the handlebars , arms outstretched but the exuberant gesture was to be his downfall , as just seconds after striking the pose , his wheels wobbled and he lost control of the bicycle			1
the sportsman , of @entity42 , @entity43 , stretched out his hands and went tumbling sideways towards the grassy verge			1
with one arm he tried to wrestle the handlebars back , but had already lost his grip and could only prepare for the worst			2
mr @entity13 - who was uninjured by his misadventure - was cycling in the @entity51 bicycle race			1
the 185 - mile event was well into its second day by the time mr @entity13 and his fellow cyclists reached the famous @entity14 incline			1
before his moment of pride and folly , he would have cycled through @entity58 , and past @entity59			2
the route also cut through central @entity61 , where the racers passed over @entity63			0
flying : the cyclist , thankfully wearing a helmet , flings his other arm in front of him as he braces for impact bottoms up : mr @entity13 's bicycle tipped and his saddle flew high as he made his inelegant descent @entity72 : mr @entity13 - who was n't hurt by his fall - turned red - faced towards his fellow riders and passing traffic not the descent he had in mind : mr @entity13 slips a few places as the competition zooms by @entity79 - clad mr @entity13 hardly finds himself alone in his enthusiasm for competitive cycling , fuelled , some say , by the notable successes of @entity85 champions including sir @entity86 , sir @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
@entity90 will once again play host to world - class cycling in two months ' time , when two stages of the @entity94 will be held in @entity95			2
riders will pedal 190km from @entity97 to @entity98 on saturday , july 5 , then 200km from @entity99 to @entity100 on sunday 6			0
the following day riders will head from @entity102 to @entity61 before continuing in @entity103			0
in recent years the sport has gone from strength to strength throughout @entity85 , with 99,000 more people cycling now than in 2008			0
according to a recent survey by @entity90 , over 2million people now cycle at least once a week			0
figures compiled by @entity112 show that 25,000 @entity85 compete regularly in cycling events , with more than 3,500 races taking place every year			0
in taking on the @entity14 climb , mr @entity13 joined a long line of cycling @entity118 - though they mostly remain upright during the attempt			1
@entity85 champions @entity89 and @entity87 , who both won medals in 2012 , took on the ascent during the road race event			0
however , though they rode to triumph in other races , road cycling was not to be theirs , with @entity127 finishing at number 103 and @entity89 at 109			0
@entity129 of @entity130 came away with the gold medal that day , boasting a time of 5 hours , 45 minutes and 57 seconds			0
@entity18 glory : in this image @entity89 , right , is shown leading the pack up @entity14 , with @entity87 two places behind			2
they would later slip more than 100 places , though neither fell over			0

@entity13 , 36 , was climbing @entity14 in @entity16 as part of a 185 - mile race when he spread wide his arms
but his triumphant gesture for the cameras did n't go quite to plan as he lost control of his bicycle
mr @entity13 , an it manager from @entity42 , @entity43 , was left face - down in the grass as others cycled past him
