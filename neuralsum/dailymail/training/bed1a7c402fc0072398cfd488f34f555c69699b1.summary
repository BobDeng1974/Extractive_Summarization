the government has agreed a compromise solution , under which all new broadband contracts will have filters turned on and existing customers will be prompted to make a decision about their service			0
@entity103 , co-chairman of @entity104 , said : ‘ @entity8 ’s figures show the problem of dealing with the internet is still growing			2
‘ parents have still not been able to catch up with their children ’s technology skills and protect them adequately			2
‘ children who use tablets are more easily able to use public wi - fi			0
instead of sitting at the family pc they can just go to the local park or café			0
and lots of public wi - fi is unfiltered , meaning they can access whatever they want			0

@entity134 , founder of the @entity136 website , told @entity137 : ' you would n't leave your house front door open to strangers , but not setting parental controls means the door is wide open for strangers to contact your kids online			2
' it 's staggering to think over half of families do n't have safety software in place , it means the message is n't getting out there about how to counteract the dangers			0
' one of the key findings of the report , was that 30 per cent of 12 to 15 - year - olds are ' friends ' on a social network with a person they have never met in real life and have sent pictures and videos to them			0
on average , teenagers said they had 272 online friends , but had never met 78 of them			0
a third allowed their pages to be viewed by strangers , up from 22 per cent last year			0
the @entity8 report warned : ‘ children with a social networking site profile that may be visible to people not known to them are more likely to have undertaken some kind of potentially risky online behaviour , such as adding people to their contacts they do n’t know in person , or sending them photos or personal details			1
