hate preacher @entity0 has been invited to speak at the @entity1 despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group hate preacher @entity0 has been invited to speak at the @entity1 despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group			1
the notorious rabble rouser received his invitation from the debating society a day before home secretary @entity11 announced a crackdown on @entity14 extremists			1
the letter said it would be a ' great privilege ' to have @entity0 appear as the star guest			1
@entity0 , who once said that @entity18 terror victim fusilier @entity17 would ' burn in hellfire ' , was even offered a choice of days on which to attend the debate entitled : this house believes that radicalism is born at home			1
@entity26 's most notorious hate preacher proudly showed off his invitation after launching a hate - filled rant against @entity29 society outside the @entity30 yesterday			1
he said : ' i am still on police bail after being arrested by @entity33 in september last year			1
' but the police ca n't stop me from speaking			2
they ca n't stop me from going to the @entity1 where i 've been invited to speak			1
' he was one of nine men held in a series of co-ordinated dawn raids by counter terrorism police in september last year			2
all the men were held on suspicion of being a member of , or backing a banned terrorist group and supporting terrorism			2
the alleged offences , which come under two counter- terrorism acts , carry a maximum penalty of seven years ' imprisonment			2
@entity0 , 47 , was arrested at an unknown location after fleeing his home in the middle of the night in the wake of threats from far - right groups			1
just hours before he was held , he posted a burst of nine inflammatory messages on @entity57 , branding @entity59 bombing raids in @entity60 as a ' rallying call for @entity14 ' and labelling the actions of @entity29 governments in @entity65 countries as ' terrorism '			2
since then he has remained on bail and must next attend a police station at the end of april when police can either charge him , release him or extend his bail			2
@entity0 , who founded the radical @entity14 group @entity72 20 years ago which was later banned , is seen as a recruiting sergeant for @entity26 's radical @entity14			1
he has played a cynical cat - and - mouse game with @entity26 authorities and has been careful to keep his incendiary speeches on the right side of @entity26 's hate law			1
worryingly , he has warned that jailing him will give him access to a new , captive congregation to radicalise inside prison			2
the @entity1 is famous for its normally high - minded debates , in which @entity26 's academic elite and their often very distinguished guests discuss the key issues of our time speaking after a @entity90 banning order , the preacher said : ' if they arrest me and put me in prison , i will carry on in prison			1
i 'll radicalise everyone in prison			2
' despite this , the @entity1 are willing to invite him to take part in a debate alongside impressionable young undergraduates			1
the invitation also flies in the face of the numerous studies highlighting the problem of radicalisation at some of @entity26 's universities			2
yesterday @entity0 launched a tirade of venom at the @entity26 establishment after mrs may said the @entity90 is drawing up a blacklist of extremist individuals and organisations with whom the government and public sector should not engage			1
he said the @entity119 and mrs may have committed more atrocities than members of @entity122			0
@entity0 also said he would be happy to travel to @entity60 to live with the terror group if the police gave him his passport back			1
' i believe people should be allowed to travel where they want to and go to @entity130 controlled territory to live under @entity132 law , ' he said			0
' i would love to travel to @entity60 and take my wife and children with me , not to commit terrorism but to live under @entity132 law			0
i had my passport taken away from me in september			0
if you give me a passport , i will go			0
' in @entity26 women who do n't have their basic needs fulfilled are having to prostitute themselves			0
elderly people are having to choose between food and heating their houses			0
in @entity130 territories they are given food and water and have gas			0
' he said that was only a matter of time before @entity132 law is enshrined in the @entity26 constitution			0
' there is nothing anyone can do to prevent it , ' @entity0 said			1
' a few years ago the government said if you do n't want to live by our laws then you can go			0
if you stop people leaving and take away their passports they have no choice but to bring @entity132 law here			0
it is better to let them go			0
' @entity167 is dead , capitalism is dying , @entity14 is the future			0
@entity14 is the fastest growing religion			0
i have no doubt that one day the whole of the world will be governed by @entity132 and the flag of @entity14 will fly over @entity176 , when justice prevails			1
' @entity178 is famous for its normally high - minded debates , in which @entity26 's academic elite and their often very distinguished guests discuss the key issues of our time			0
one of the @entity1 's most notorious debates came in 1933 - when @entity186 was beginning his rise to power - and was anything but light - hearted			0
undergraduates passed the controversial motion , ' this house would not in any circumstances fight for @entity194 and country '			0
it was criticised at the time by @entity198 as ' abject , squalid and shameless '			0
last night it declined to comment on @entity0 's invitation .			1
