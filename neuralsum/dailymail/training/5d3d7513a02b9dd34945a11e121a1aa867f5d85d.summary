the @entity1 are not an enemy of the @entity3 and should not be talked about in such terms , @entity0 has claimed			1
the vice-president said the militant @entity7 group only represents an inherent threat if it allows @entity9 to strike at the @entity3 in an interview with @entity11 , mr @entity0 warned against labelling the @entity1 as an enemy			1
language of peace ? @entity0 said the @entity1 only represents an inherent threat if it allows @entity9 to strike at the @entity3 he said : ' that 's critical			1
there is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the @entity1 is our enemy because it threatens @entity3 interests			1
' mr @entity0 's comments come as senior @entity3 officials prepare to negotiate a peace deal with @entity1 militants			1
even after a surge in @entity3 troops in @entity33 has pushed the @entity1 out of much of their southern stronghold , the group 's intentions regarding peace talks remain unclear			1
a senior @entity1 commander , speaking after @entity3 officials ' description of the peace process was published on sunday , denied the group is engaged in negotiations			1
' our position on talks remains the same			0
all occupying forces have to leave @entity33			0
then we can talk , ' the commander told @entity47			0
it is thought that the @entity1 might deny taking part in initial discussions to shore up morale among fighters on the ground			2
but the news of possible peace talks with the @entity1 has been met with some resistance , illustrating the political risk the @entity59 administration is taking by considering a prisoner transfer			2
down with arms ? @entity3 officials are preparing to negotiate a peace deal with @entity1 militants government officials claim a transfer of @entity1 prisoners from the @entity68 military prison into @entity33 government custody could be one confidence - building measure critical to making progress towards a peace deal between the @entity1 and the government of @entity33 president @entity74			1
but a key @entity76 senator yesterday warned against negotiations with the @entity1			0
senator @entity78 , senior @entity76 on the @entity79 , said : ' it sounds as if the administration has decided to negotiate with terrorists , something the @entity3 does not do			2
' handing over detainees , who likely continue to pose a threat to the @entity3 , should not be the first step in building confidence			2
' officials are not optimistic about their chances of clinching a deal , but they hope the transfer of five @entity1 detainees and other possible confidence - building measures , including a @entity1 denunciation of terrorism , might lead to authentic @entity33 - @entity1 talks on the war - torn country 's political future			2
@entity76 senator @entity78 @entity101 efforts to strike a deal with a repressive @entity7 movement that has been killing @entity3 soldiers for a decade - even if it is now widely accepted the war can not be won on the battlefield alone - could become a liability for mr @entity59 in an election year			1
mr @entity78 said : ' any discussion of prisoner transfers should only be done after an agreement to cease hostilities has been reached			0
' it should be done in the open , with thorough oversight from @entity115 and visibility for the @entity3 people about exactly who these detainees are and what terrorist acts they committed			0
' officials said the possible transfer of detainees would be a ' national decision ' made in consultation with @entity115 in accordance with new rules for handling detainees			0
mr @entity59 is expected to shortly sign into law the 2011 defence authorisation bill , which includes provisions that would broaden the military 's involvement in detaining suspected militants and require the @entity135 to certify in most cases certain security conditions will be met before prisoners can be sent home			0
but the @entity101 has stressed that any real negotiations must take place directly between the @entity74 government and the @entity1 , with @entity3 diplomats only playing a facilitating role			1
yet it is clear that in @entity147 , there is a growing willingness to engage directly with the @entity1 as foreign troops edge closer towards the exit in @entity33			0
mr @entity59 has promised to withdraw his 33,000 surge troops by next autumn , and most foreign combat troops are expected to be gone by the end of 2014 , leaving @entity33 forces in the lead			0
a modest @entity3 troop presence is expected to stay beyond that , focused on counter-terrorism and training local forces .			0
