proposal : diesel drivers could face a charge of £ 10 when driving through central @entity3 from 2020 drivers of diesel cars face financial penalties to curb air pollution in city centres			1
under plans drawn up by @entity3 mayor @entity10 , nearly all diesel vehicle drivers would be hit by a £ 10 charge to drive into @entity3 , while other cities are considering introducing low - emission zones to crack down on diesel fumes			1
mr @entity10 will also lobby the government to raise road tax on diesel cars to encourage motorists to switch to cleaner vehicles			1
elsewhere , @entity21 is planning a network of low - emission zones that would force older diesel vehicles out of many cities			2
@entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and 15 other cities are considering bringing in the zones to cope with poor air quality			0
the changes in @entity3 , which would come into effect in 2020 , would mean diesel drivers would have to pay an additional £ 10 to drive into @entity3 ’s ‘ ultra low emission zone ’			1
the area will have the same boundaries as the @entity40 , and only diesel vehicles that meet the @entity43 emissions standard will be exempt from the charge			0
petrol cars registered before 2006 will also have to pay			0
the threat of heavy fines for breaches of air pollution rules , set by the @entity50 , have driven the new initiatives to cut diesel fumes			2
the commission launched legal proceedings against @entity55 in february			0
@entity76 , mr @entity10 ’s environment adviser , told @entity77 : ‘ we want to see an unwinding of incentives that have driven people to diesel			2
‘ @entity43 engine standards on emissions have not delivered the savings expected , meaning we now have a legacy of a generation of dirty diesels			0

plans by mayor @entity10 could see diesel drivers hit with £ 10 charge
if given go - ahead , diesel cars would face charge in central @entity3 from 2020
other major cities could also introduce *similar* scheme as part of bid to reduce air pollution
