by @entity0 published : 21:17 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 16:14 est , 26 october 2012 tests for trainee teachers will be radically toughened up to boost the calibre of staff entering schools			1
a review ordered by education secretary @entity7 found that existing @entity9 and maths tests taken by applicants are too easy , with many questions pitched merely at the level of grade d at @entity14			1
changes to make the tests tougher will include a ban on using calculators in the maths test and a new writing exercise in @entity9 to assess vocabulary			1
learning : under new proposals , from next september , anyone who wants to train as a teacher will have to complete revamped tests in @entity9 and maths all applicants for teacher training will be required to sit the tests , which will be raised to standards equivalent to grade b at @entity14 within three years			1
trainees will also have to sit a new reasoning test designed to assess their powers of logic and deduction			1
verbal , numerical and abstract reasoning will be examined			1
good marks in the tests may be linked to higher bursaries under proposals being considered by ministers			1
top graduates currently qualify for training incentives of up to £ 20,000			1
reports from @entity47 inspectors suggest some staff have a poor grasp of their subjects , leading to gaps in children ’s knowledge			1
yet 98 per cent of teacher trainees pass the current selection tests			1
about one in five need to resit at least once in order to pass			0
the review panel led by @entity58 , principal of @entity59 in @entity60 , found some questions ‘ are not sufficiently demanding , appearing to be in some cases below the level of gcse grade c ’			2
in maths , the emphasis was on ‘ simple ’ calculations			0
in @entity9 , assessment of key skills was excluded			0
passing the numeracy test has been a requirement of @entity72 since 2000 , and literacy the following year			0
until last month , trainees only sat the tests towards the end of their courses			2
the new changes will be phased in from next september , with the reasoning test introduced from 2014			1
candidates will be limited to two resits			0
if they fail three times , they will be barred from applying for teacher training for two years			0
expectations : @entity85 said many children were led to believe top exam grades were beyond them @entity88 @entity85 said yesterday that too many children were led to believe that top exam grades , places at elite universities and professional careers were beyond them			1
mr @entity85 added that even in relatively affluent areas many young people saw a job with one of the big local employers as the limit of their ambition			1
‘ teachers , colleges , careers advisers have a role and a responsibility to aim for the stars and to encourage people to believe they can reach the top in education and employment , ’ mr @entity85 said			1
‘ that ’s not happening as much as it should			0
’ the comments by mr @entity85 were his first remarks on education since his return to @entity116 in last month ’s reshuffle			1
he quit as the @entity119 ’s chief secretary to the treasury in may 2010 after it was revealed he had been guilty of an expenses fiddle totalling more than £ 50,000			0
the minister , a former @entity123 banker who was privately educated , told the @entity124 that many young people outside @entity60 believed that high - flying careers in law , journalism or banking were effectively closed to them			2
‘ even in my own constituency , @entity131 , which would not be regarded as one of the deprivation blackspots of the country , most young people would regard going into investment banking as almost leaving the country , because it ’s a different world , ’ he said			0
‘ they will often be encouraged to think it is beyond them			0
’ the comments by mr @entity85 , a close ally of deputy prime minister @entity140 , are likely to infuriate further teaching unions already at loggerheads with ministers over the @entity119 ’s education reforms			1
here are some questions from the current literacy and numeracy tests and proposed questions from the new maths and @entity9 papers			2
scroll down for the answers			0

on average each paper - based portfolio includes 75 printed pages			2
costs are : printing - 2.5p per page ; ring binder - 75p			0

proposed maths paper : ( no calculator allowed ) the cost , £ c , of advertising in a newspaper is worked out using the formula : c = 0.4n + 0.75 where n is the number of words in the advertisement			2
