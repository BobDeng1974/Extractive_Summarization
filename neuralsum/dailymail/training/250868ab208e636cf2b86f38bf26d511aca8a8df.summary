she 's the size 12 model who has become a byword for feminine curves but @entity5 says she 's sick of being classed as ' plus size '			1
in an interview with @entity9 , the 24 - year - old @entity7 spoke of her bemusement that despite being the owner of a toned , healthy body , the fashion industry persists in considering her - and others like her - larger than normal			1
' people think plus - size models do n't exercise - we do ! ' she said			2
' but it 's about health , not forcing my body to be something it 's not meant to be			0
' even at my lightest , i just could n't get there , ' she explains			0
' i genuinely really tried			0
i was counting calories , i was taking diet pills , i was dabbling in starvation			0
' she adds : ' i thought you had to be skinny to be beautiful			0
and i thought i would never be beautiful at this size			0
' since giving calorie - counting the boot , @entity5 has shot to fame and has followed in the stiletto - clad footsteps of fellow high - profile plus - size models , @entity50 and @entity51 - both of whom are as much admired for their curves as they are for their beauty			1
in proportion : @entity5 shows off her toned size 12 figure in a campaign for lingerie brand @entity59 plus - size ? @entity51 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) are both categorised as larger models nevertheless , the question of using plus - size models remains fraught in an industry where the average girl is between 5ft 8 " and 6ft tall , and wears dress size six			1
by contrast , the average plus - size model , although of a similar height to other girls , is a dress size 12 or 14			1
although recently signed by @entity77 to front their new plus - size range @entity73 - which starts at a size 12 - @entity5 , who boasts perfect proportions , is irritated that the industry continues to see her and others like her as a niche part of the business			1
she also questions why models who fall in the ' no - man 's land ' between straight size and plus - size continue to be left out , despite having healthy size 10 bodies			1
' people say , " how is she a plus - size model ? " and i 'm like , " exactly , this is the point , how am i a plus - size model ? " glamorous : plus size model @entity95 starred in a campaign for @entity99 lingerie by @entity100 healthy : @entity5 shows off her curves on the beach in @entity7 ( left ) and on the cover of @entity9 ( right ) stunning : recently , @entity5 appeared in a @entity106 lingerie campaign aimed at women of all sizes ' fashion designers wo n't go past a size two [ @entity112 size six ] , so there 's no size diversity - just none			1
' so there 's a whole no - man 's land of models who are in between the ' straight size ' and the ' plus - size ' and they are not working , yet they 've got these amazing bodies that are completely in proportion			2
' she also revealed that she would like to see the end of the term ' plus - size ' altogether , arguing that as she is n't a plus - size person , she should n't be considered one			2
' i do n't think anyone should be called plus - size , ' she adds			2
' i think it 's derogatory to anyone - it 's a label			0
' i 'm a model ; i do n't think i need ' plus - size ' in front of it			2
