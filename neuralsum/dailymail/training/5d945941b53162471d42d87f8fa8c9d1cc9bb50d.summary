by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 05:25 est , 9 july 2013 it was a marriage of money and power last night at @entity5 's summer party			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 turned out to celebrate the weekly @entity10 magazine , which focuses on political and current events			1
held at their office in @entity14 , @entity15 , some of politics ' most influential faces mingled over champagne , and as the magazine 's latest contributor @entity22 made sure she worked the circuit			0
contributor : @entity8 attended @entity5 summer party , of which she is a contributor			1
pictured here with @entity28 , editor of the spectator all white : @entity22 writes a weekly diary column for the @entity10 magazine , where she describes her weekly plans and musings dressed in a pretty white crochet summer dress , @entity22 was seen sharing a few jokes with @entity29 editor @entity28			1
her boyfriend @entity38 was also in attendance at the high - profile bash but took a back seat as @entity22 worked the room			0
mingling : dressed in a summery white dress , @entity22 mingled with some of the country 's most powerful politicians by her side : @entity22 's boyfriend @entity38 attended the high - profile event with her she mingled with some of politics 's most powerful people such as @entity51 , secretary of state for defence , @entity53 , minister of state for policing and @entity55 and @entity56 , minister of state for universities and @entity58			2
the magazine , which is currently owned by @entity60 , who also own @entity61 , is well known for supporting the conservative party			0
@entity63 of @entity29 has often been cited as a step on the ladder to a high position in the @entity10			2
big names : the party , which was held at the magazine 's office in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity71 , saw the likes of @entity6 and @entity7 in attendance men in power : ( @entity76 ) @entity77 , mp the @entity10 chairman , @entity80 , @entity6 and @entity29 editor @entity28 caught up over some drinks high - profile guests : lord @entity84 , @entity85 and sir @entity86 also attended the bash having fun : @entity7 and @entity22 seemed to be enjoying themselves at the party to celebrate the weekly conservative magazine , which focuses on political and current events and with past editors such as @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 all going on to become cabinet members , it really does seem to be the case			1
@entity100 , who was editor between 1999 and 2005 , also seemingly used his position at the magazine as a springboard for a greater role in public affairs			0
so it comes as no surprise that the @entity10 's were out in force			2
@entity100 's sister @entity109 was in attendance , along with @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 , minister of state for international development			0
mingling : @entity116 , @entity117 chatted to @entity118 and @entity120 mp @entity119 dapper : @entity122 and @entity123 were dressed impeccably for the event fellow writers : @entity126 caught up with journalist , historian , speechwriter and author , @entity131 @entity116 , @entity117 also put in an appearance , as did lord @entity84 , @entity85 and sir @entity86			1
the @entity29 , an intellectual weekly magazine first published in 1828 , might not come to mind as the natural platform for the thoughts of @entity136 's little sister , who is widely celebrated as a ‘ rear of the year ’ contender			1
but her weekly tongue - in - cheek ' diary ' for the magazine has been met by criticism in intellectual circles			1
arrival : @entity80 and @entity145 as well as mrs @entity56 and mrs @entity146 were at the event suited and booted : @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity114 , minister of state for international development joined the party enjoying themselves : @entity51 , secretary of state for defence and @entity113 mp seemed to be enjoying the summer event the column records her daily activities and musings such as a fly - fishing trip in @entity159 , her plans to enter a running , cycling and kayaking triathlon in @entity164 and even that she apparently has a soft spot for @entity166 , ‘ a man who exudes so much grace and beauty that he inspires anybody with a pulse , ’ as she puts it			0
those close to @entity22 insisted the @entity29 articles are all her own work , and that she deliberately intended to send herself up			0
‘ it is completely intentional and good humoured , ’ a source told the @entity175			0
musings : @entity8 's blogs also appear on @entity29 website and they are very tongue - in - cheek			2
