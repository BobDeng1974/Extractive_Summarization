a @entity1 sniping training program has been suspended after police were found to be using mug shots of black teenagers for target practice in a discovery that sparked outrage online			1
the six pictures , printed out on a single piece of paper and used as targets by @entity13 police snipers , were discovered riddled by bullets at a shooting range in @entity16 in december			1
they featured a number of former convicts , including @entity20 , then aged 18 , who was arrested in connection to a drag race in 2000 that left two people dead			1
he was released in 2004			2
after @entity28 sergeant @entity27 - who coincidentally happens to be @entity20 's sister - found the targets discarded at the range , she posted an image of them online			1
on friday evening , @entity54 police chief @entity53 said that he realized the six images may appear offensive when viewed apart from other targets , such as images of late terrorist @entity58			2
' for that reason , i immediately suspend the sniper training program , ' he said , adding that he was particularly concerned about the use of photos of men who ' would be on the streets ' of the city			1
chief @entity53 said the force is reviewing the materials its snipers use , ordering commercially produced images instead of mug shots and launching an investigation , the @entity67 reported			1
but he said no - one in the sniper team - which includes minorities - will be disciplined for using the black teenagers ' mug shots as targets - an action which did not violate any department policies			1
@entity81 , who plays clarinet with the @entity28 ’s 13th @entity83 , was attending the range after the snipers for annual weapons qualifications training when she discovered the mug shots			1

' there were like gunshots there			0
and i cried a couple of times			0
' following ms @entity27 's discovery , she immediately called her brother , who was speechless			2
@entity20 then took to his @entity120 page to share the image of the targets - including himself - to his friends , writing : ' attention ! ! ! ! ! to all my friends , @entity120 friends and family			1

we do n’t just shoot at black males			0
' she added that the snipers find it useful to use lineups with faces that share similar characteristics - and that the targets should have been properly disposed of before the police left the range			2
scene : sgt @entity20 said she was shocked to recognize her brother in one of the images at the shooting range ( pictured ) in @entity16 , particularly because he was arrested 15 years ago and his photo was riddled by bullets chief : the targets sparked anger among the online community			1
on friday , @entity54 police chief @entity53 ( pictured ) said that he realized the six images may appear offensive when viewed apart from other targets however , the use of photo lineups for target practice - instead of commercially produced images - does not appear to be a common practice among police departments in the area			1
neither @entity182 police , nor four other forces , use such photos to practice their marksmanship			0
@entity186 , a prominent local attorney and @entity83 veteran , said his unit never considered shooting at images of real people , saying : ' of course it 's offensive			2
you should n't be shooting at faces anyway			0
' retired @entity195 agent , @entity194 , added : ' the use of those targets does n’t seem correct			0
the police have different options for targets			0
i think they have to be extra careful and sensitive to some issues			0

there have been violent protests over grand jury decisions following the deaths of @entity212 ( left ) and @entity213 ( right ) in recent months , racial tensions in @entity205 have made headlines across the world			0
in november , a grand jury in @entity216 , @entity217 , chose not to indict white police officer @entity218 in the shooting death of unarmed black 18 - year - old @entity212			2
