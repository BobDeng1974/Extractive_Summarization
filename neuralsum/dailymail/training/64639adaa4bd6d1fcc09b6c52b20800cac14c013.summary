@entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity0 said sunday that gun laws proposed after the 2012 @entity5 school massacre in his state could have prevented deranged mass - murderer @entity7 from taking six lives friday night in @entity9 , @entity10			1
but tourists in @entity12 for @entity13 told @entity14 that they are n't buying what @entity0 is selling			1
the former @entity2 governor wants @entity17 to take a second bit at the apple after gun control legislation failed in the @entity21			1
senator @entity0 has kept the december 2012 @entity5 shooting in the front of @entity12 's minds , addressing participants of an annual 400 - mile bike ride ' in support of common sense legislation to reduce gun violence ' sign advocating gun control have sprung up in @entity9 , @entity10 in the days since 20 - year - old @entity31 student @entity30 and five others died in a shooting and stabbing rampage ' the legislation that failed to pass – it got support from 55 senators – would have provided a mental health initiative with more resources , greater ability for the @entity9 police to intervene , to use the sheriff 's word , to have professionals trained in diagnosing and detecting this kind of derangement , ' he said on ' @entity48 ' ' obviously , not every kind of gun violence is going to be prevented by laws out of @entity12			1
but at least we can make a start , and i am going to urge that we bring back those bills , ' he told @entity57 guest host @entity56			0
he added that a new approach might ' reconfigure them to center on mental health , which is a point where we can agree that we need more resources to make the country healthier and to make sure that these kinds of horrific , insane , mad occurrences are stopped			2
' ' @entity17 will be complicit if we fail to act , ' @entity0 insisted			1
the failed 2013 gun bills included provisions for bans on so - called ' asault ' weapons , a maximum legal capacity for ammunition magazines , and an expanded background check system for prospective gun buyers			1
the handguns guns and ammunition found near @entity7 's body on friday night were all purchased legally			0
he had a long history of mental health disorders			2
and authorities had had three contacts with @entity82 in the past year , including an april 30 home visit at his family 's request			0
but deputies reported back he was socially awkward but not in immediate need of mental health intervention			2
those factors , under current law , were not sufficient to limit his legal access to firearms			0
@entity0 has emerged as a major anti-gun legislator , pushing for new laws in his home state that are now some of the most restrictive in the country outpouring : thousands of people marched through the @entity31 campus on saturday during a candlelight vigil for the victims a renewed emphasis on mental - health qualifications for gun ownership , however , is the only feature of last year 's legislative failure that could have made a difference			1
none of the @entity112 and @entity113 semiautomatic pistols @entity7 used were covered by the proposed gun bans			0
none of his three guns used a nonstandard magazine			0
@entity119 - born student @entity7 , 22 -- son of ' @entity121 ' film director @entity120 -- murdered six people in the @entity124 district of @entity9 , @entity10 on friday night but members of the general public have been quick to point out that he also stabbed three people to death before his shooting rampage started			0
' sure , it 's time for knife control , ' said @entity132 , a @entity12 visitor from @entity133 who spoke to @entity14 on the @entity134 in @entity12			1
' people are strangled with panty hose			2
good luck convincing my wife it 's time to ban those			0
' @entity142 from @entity143 , picnicking on a blanket near the @entity145 , said that ' lunatics will be lunatics			0
you ca n't go creating a @entity149 planet for everyone by putting government in charge , and it seems to me that the @entity155 @entity154 is there to make sure no one can try			1
' @entity0 signaled his intent to renew talk of gun control measures , particularly those aimed at mental health requirements			1
the bill he supported last year , he said , would have given @entity165 's deputies more latitude to intervene			0
the lawmaker also said when he heard @entity168 , the father of one of friday night 's casualties , blame ' craven politicians ' and the @entity172 for his son 's death , he heard echoes of @entity5 parents			0
' that gut - wrenching , heartbreaking statement is a reminder of how we felt in the wake of @entity5 on december 14 a year and a half ago , ' @entity0 said , ' when it seemed like we were on the verge of , potentially , legislation that would stop the madness and end the insanity that has killed too many young people – thousands , tens of thousands since @entity5			2

@entity2 sen. @entity188 said @entity190 gun bills in @entity17 would have given authorities more room to intervene
but *ordinary* @entity155 in @entity12 for @entity13 said *cynically* that ' knife control ' and bans on panty hose – used to strangle people – would come next
' @entity199 will be lunatics , ' said a tourist from @entity143 : ' you ca n't go creating a @entity149 planet for everyone by putting government in charge '
@entity0 insisted sunday that *tighter* mental health screening could have saved lives , but *republicans* in the @entity21 blocked it in 2013
