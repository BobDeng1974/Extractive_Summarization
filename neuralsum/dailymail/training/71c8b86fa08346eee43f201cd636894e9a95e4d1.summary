by @entity0 published : 22:21 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 04:02 est , 21 june 2012 @entity2 weather forecasters have been accused of driving away tourists from seaside resorts with ' alarmist ' reports of floods and storms			1
one holiday park owner in @entity9 criticised meteorologists for ' trying to cover all eventualities ' to avoid a repeat of the infamous 1987 hurricane blooper by @entity14			1
another , who runs resorts in @entity18 , said staycationers were ' terrified ' to come to his sites because of fears their caravans would be left ' bobbing around ' on flood water			1
' alarmist ' : seaside resorts have accused @entity2 forecasters of driving away tourists with overly negative predictions , but in some areas such as @entity30 ( pictured ) in @entity31 they have proved accurate angry : one resort owner in @entity18 said meteorologists were tarnishing the whole country with a ' single wet weather symbol ' by making it seem like floods such as this one in a @entity39 caravan park would affect all tourist hotspots they are now asking for weathermen to not tarnish the whole country with a ' single wet - weather symbol ' and be ' more careful with their phrasing '			2
@entity46 , who runs the @entity48 holiday site in @entity49 , @entity9 , said ' alarmist ' forecasts , which often proved groundless , were having a major impact on bookings across the @entity53			2
she said : ' it is already causing holiday - makers to stay away			2
just a few days ago we were hearing that all caravan parks in the @entity53 were on flood alert and this simply was n't the case			2
' we 've been receiving many calls from worried customers , but we assure them that flooding at our altitude would also mean the entire @entity64 was hundreds of feet underwater			0
' ' trying to cover all eventualities ' : waves crash into @entity68 during a storm			1
forecasters have been accused of over-egging reports to ensure they do n't end up with another ' @entity14 ' incident @entity73 , director of @entity74 , which has more than 700 caravans at @entity76 and @entity77 , said : ' just last week we were told that all caravan parks in southern @entity80 were on flood alert and this simply was n't the case			1
' some parks in @entity39 did flood recently , but that 's no reason to suggest that caravans in @entity18 would soon be bobbing around on parks which have never flooded before			0
' he added : ' coastal holiday parks in @entity18 often stay dry when it is raining inland , yet forecasters frequently tarnish the whole county with a single wet - weather symbol			0
' @entity2 weather presenter @entity94 said there was no reason why forecasters would want to ' dampen the sprits or be deliberately pessimistic			0
' ' our job to focus of negatives ' : @entity2 weather presenter @entity94 said forecasters needed to warn people of any dangers mr @entity94 , who predicts the weather on @entity106 , said : ' i understand the frustration and there is a tendency for weather forecasters to emphasise on the negative aspects of the weather			0
' it 's just that our job is to pick out the most important parts of the weather which can affect people 's lives			0
' if indeed there 's going to be a shower somewhere we need to flag up that possibility			0
' in 1987 , mr @entity14 drew stinging criticism when he flatly denied a viewer 's claim that a hurricane was about to hit @entity126 just hours before the @entity127 caused devastation across the country .			1

they are ' trying to cover all eventualities ' over fears of another ' @entity14 ' incident , owners claim
