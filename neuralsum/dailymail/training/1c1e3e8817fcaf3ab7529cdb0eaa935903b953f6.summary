by @entity0 rare leopard spot fish have been bred in an aquarium for the first time ever			1
the colourful leopard spot goby fish , which are covered in bright red and orange spots , were virtually unknown around the @entity8 coast until the introduction of modern scuba equipment			1
but now they have been successfully bred for the first time in captivity at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 and staff are hopeful the tiny hatchlings will continue to thrive			1
hundreds of rare leopard spot goby fish have been bred at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 @entity20 , who is rearing the hatchlings at the aquariums nursery said : ' leopard spot gobies are definitely one of the most attractive of our native species			1
' their bright markings are all the more unusual as most other members of the goby family are far more drably coloured to match their rocky or sandy habitat			2
' we 're looking after literally hundreds of microscopic hatchlings with even more due to hatch out any day			2
' we have a group of four adults here at @entity34 but this is the first time they have bred			0
as far as we know the species is not on display anywhere else in the @entity8 so we think this is actually a first			0
' the aquarium have successfully bred hundreds of the hatchlings , which are pictured here under a microscope the species is thought to be native to the south west of @entity46 , with further populations reported in the north east of the country			2
the leopard spot goby lives in shallow seas below the low water mark in rocky areas and are occasionally found in rockpools			0
in the wild they feed on small crustaceans and other tiny invertebrates			0
although records are scarce , experts believe the fish breed in the spring and are relatively short - lived - apparently dying once they have spawned .			0
