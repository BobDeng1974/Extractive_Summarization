by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 09:07 est , 4 january 2014 appeal : @entity5 , here with husband @entity3 , specialises in environmental law @entity3 's barrister wife is representing a wind farm company in a case which campaigners say could open the way to vast turbines blighting historic sites			1
@entity5 , who specialises in environmental law , is advising @entity15 in its bid to build four 400ft turbines on land owned by the @entity19			1
the plan had been rejected on the grounds it would overshadow a @entity24 summer house set in what a planning inspector called @entity29 ’s finest @entity28 garden , with ‘ national if not international significance ’			0
but the @entity32 ’s wife is helping the firm bring an appeal case against the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , which jointly secured a ruling against the wind farm at the @entity40 last march			1
the parties argued successfully that it would blight @entity42 , the grade i - listed lodge and garden about half a mile away			1
@entity44 , chief executive of @entity36 , said : ‘ the effect of the proposed turbines on one of the most important , beautiful and unspoilt @entity28 landscapes in @entity49 would be appalling			2
this is why we pressed this case			2
’ however documents written by @entity53 and @entity54 for the @entity56 case on january 23 claim the evidence for this was ‘ less than substantial ’			1
@entity59 , the local @entity35 manager , said if the wind farm company won the appeal , it would make life easier for turbine developers to over-ride people ’s concerns about other heritage sites			0
he said : ‘ it will set a precedent which would be used for other applications that a 400ft object half a mile from grade i - listed buildings is acceptable			1
’ the case has been fought for two years since the application was rejected by the local council , then overturned by a planning inspector who allowed it to meet green energy targets , despite admitting it would be ‘ alien and incongruous ’			2
@entity35 and @entity36 then defeated it at the @entity40			0
the @entity35 billed it as ‘ an important marker in the defence of the historic environment from inappropriate development ’			0
the land is owned by the @entity88 ’s cousin , the @entity19 , whose estate could make £ 120,000 a year in rental fees from the turbines			2
he is backing the energy firm , which says the project will provide clean electricity to more than 5,400 homes			0
under - threat : the @entity98 - listed @entity42 on which a wind farm would be built the @entity19 , who lives in an apartment in @entity103 , is also patron of the @entity105 which includes @entity42			1
@entity106 was begun in the late 1500s by local sheriff sir @entity107			0
it was left unfinished when he died in 1605			0
@entity35 discovered the remains of an @entity28 pleasure garden in the grounds and restored its moats and orchards			0
@entity114 , chairman of the campaign group @entity116 , said : ‘ it is hypocritical of the @entity19 to serve as patron of an organisation which seeks to protect our heritage while at the same time supporting a scheme which will damage it			0
’ a spokesman for miss @entity5 said : ‘ like all members of her profession , @entity5 is subject to the “ cab rank rule ” which stipulates that barristers act for anyone requesting their professional services			1
