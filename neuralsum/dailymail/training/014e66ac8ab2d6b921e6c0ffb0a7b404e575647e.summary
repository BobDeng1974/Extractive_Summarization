the star , real name @entity2 , fell victim to changes in @entity14 rules made in 2011 which removed the right of defendants to have the ‘ reasonable ’ costs of hiring a lawyer reimbursed if they are found not guilty			1
the 48 - year - old was accused of raping and sexually assaulting a teenage girl but was cleared by a jury last week in under five hours			2
and now the tv star hopes to reclaim the enormous legal costs amid questions over whether the case should ever have been brought to trial in the first place			1
a friend of the actor said he planned to ‘ fight ’ for justice after two years of hell , adding : ‘ @entity34 and his entire family have suffered – not just mentally but financially throughout this farcical trial			0
‘ it is not just the substantial legal fees to worry about – there is also the damaging effect the trial will have on him for the rest of his life and career			2
‘ there have been early discussions between him and his legal counsel and they have agreed that they have not finished working together			0
’ and another tv insider stressed that while soap actors are ‘ reasonably well paid ’ , they are not as wealthy as many would believe			0
the source added : ‘ the estimates about what tv actors get paid for appearing in soaps are usually hugely exaggerated			0
' of course they are on comfortable salaries , but not enough to fund something like this			0
’ the case against the actor was initially dropped by the @entity3 in january 2012 due to a lack of evidence , after he was arrested in september 2011			1
but on february 14 this year @entity69 , principal legal adviser to the @entity70 , announced that she had reviewed the decision and authorised @entity72 to charge @entity2			1
out of pocket : the star fell victim to changes in @entity14 rules made in 2011 which removed the right of defendants to have the ' reasonable ' costs of hiring a lawyer reimbursed if they are found not guilty an insider at the @entity14 admitted it would be possible for the actor to bring a case against the @entity3 , explaining : ‘ it depends on the individual circumstances of a case , but it is certainly a possibility			1
‘ the rules were changed in 2011 to prevent the taxpayer footing large bills for those who can afford to pay for their own defence			0
‘ legal aid is means tested and the vast majority of cases in crown courts are funded that way			0
’ the trial has also seen many members of mr @entity2 ’s family incur huge travel costs – some of them flying over from @entity108 to support him as he faced 12 charges at @entity110 .			2
