a study found that many people in @entity4 do not seek help for the early symptoms of cancer because they are embarrassed or reluctant to waste their doctors ’ time			1
experts say this @entity4 stoicism may help explain differences in cancer survival between the @entity4 and other high - income countries			1
britons also have less awareness of cancer risk increasing with age , meaning sufferers are less likely to be treated at an early stage when there is more chance of a cure			2
the @entity4 is joint bottom with @entity32 of the international table for rates of survival , despite all six of the countries surveyed having similarly good access to healthcare			1
there were 157,000 deaths from cancer in the @entity4 in 2010 , with more than three quarters occurring in those aged 65 and over			1
scientists from the @entity46 previously found that for lung , breast , bowel and ovarian cancers diagnosed between 1995 and 2007 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 had the best survival rates			2
@entity32 and the @entity4 had the lowest , despite all the countries having similarly good cancer registration systems and access to healthcare			1
one year survival for people with lung cancer was 30 per cent in the @entity4 , compared with 44 per cent in @entity49			1
the latest study , conducted by @entity64 and @entity65 , surveyed 19,079 people aged 50 and older in six countries to see if cultural factors could explain the differences			1
it found little difference in people ’s views about the chances of surviving the disease or awareness of symptoms			0
but when the study , published in the @entity81 , looked at barriers to seeing the doctor with early symptoms , our stiff upper lip came to the fore			0
worrying about wasting a doctor ’s time was a concern for 34 per cent of those in the @entity4 , compared with only 9 per cent of @entity49			1
and embarrassment about seeing the doctor with a potentially serious symptom was most common in @entity4 ( 15 per cent ) and least common in @entity32 ( 6 per cent )			2
awareness of the link between cancer and age was lowest in @entity48 ( 13 per cent ) and the @entity4 ( 14 per cent ) but highest in @entity49 ( 38 per cent )			2
reluctant : experts say @entity4 stoicism may help explain differences in cancer survival between the @entity4 and other high - income countries dr @entity101 , a study leader from @entity102 , said the @entity4 was making its mark for the wrong reasons			1
she added : ‘ a high proportion of people said that not wanting to waste the doctor ’s time and embarrassment might stop them going to the doctor with a symptom that might be serious			2
‘ the traditional @entity4 stiff upper lip could be preventing people from seeing their doctor			2
‘ we need to support people to make the right decisions about their health			0
’ a top cancer charity has been warned about sending out thousands of ' threatening ' letters designed to raise funds			0
the @entity121 has banned @entity64 from using the tactic , which people felt put them under unnecessary pressure to make a donation			0
the charity circular was delivered to homes in a plain brown envelope with ' it does n't matter to me who you are ' in place of the address			0
a letter inside included a series of alarming statements about cancer and the devastation it can cause , including : ' i 'm still tearing lives apart			0
every two minutes i take hold of another person			0
' it added : ' do n't donate to @entity64			0
i 'm sure you have better things to spend your money on than trying to beat me			0
' the @entity121 said the letter was ' likely to be received as a threatening message ' .			0

study *suggests* @entity4 are embarrassed or reluctant to waste doctors ' time
survey *questioned* 19,079 people aged 50 and older in six countries
experts say @entity4 stoicism could explain differences in cancer survival
