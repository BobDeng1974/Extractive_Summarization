smartphones have become so integral to modern life , they may have altered the shape and function of the human brain , according to new research			1
experts have discovered that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs			1

they think that the more time someone spends fiddling with their smartphone , the bigger the link between brain and hand neuroscientist dr @entity29 , who led a study into the impact of mobile phone use , said our ‘ newfound obsession ’ with smartphones demonstrated the ability of the brain to mould to its circumstances			0
but while the brain has long been known to be able to adapt to new demands - such changes can sometimes result in chronic pain and movement disorders			0
dr @entity29 of the @entity45 in @entity46 , said : ‘ i think we must appreciate how common personal digital devices are and how densely people use them			2
‘ the digital technology we use on a daily basis shapes the sensory processing in our brains			0
’ smartphones force people to use their hands in ways they have never had to in the history of human evolution			0
the @entity46 team tracked 37 volunteers over ten days - 27 of them using touchscreen phones and 11 using traditional mobile telephones with fixed buttons			1
monitoring their brain waves , they found that people using the modern touchscreen phones had altered the form and function of their somatosensory cortex			1
writing in the journal @entity73 , the scientists said those who used smartphones had changed the way their thumbs and brains worked together , with a larger effect seen with those who had used their phones more			2
while using fixed buttons require simple hand movements , using a touchscreen requires a far more complex set of motions			1
the part of the brain controlling the sense of touch in the thumbs and fingertips saw much more activity - increasing the connection between them and speeding up reaction time and sensitivity			2
more touchscreen use translated directly into greater brain activity when the thumbs were touched , they found			2
not only are we suddenly using our fingertips and thumbs in a new way , but we do so hour after hour , day after day			0

‘ we found that the common use of touchscreen phones was associated with cortical reorganisation , ’ they wrote			1
‘ the cortical activity evoked by touch to the thumb tip was directly proportional to the amount of thumb use over the past ten days			1
’ dr @entity29 said : ‘ i was really surprised by the scale of the changes introduced by the use of smartphones			0
’ he compared the brain alteration to those seen in keen musicians			0

the somatosensory cortex ( pictured top centre ) of the brain saw much more activity - increasing the connection between fingers and speeding up reaction time and sensitivity in violinists , for instance , the area of the brain linked to the fingers that guide the instrument is larger than in other people			1
but while there may be benefits - for example increased sensitivity and faster links between brain and fingers - the scientists are concerned that intense phone use may also be bad for human health			0
altering the shape of the somatosensory cortex can lead to pain , spasms and movement disorders such as dystonia , they warned			2
the scientists said that the brain alterations are likely to be ‘ maladaptive ’			0
‘ plasticity of the somatosensory cortex is associated with the development of chronic pain , ’ they wrote in the journal article			2
‘ worryingly , there is some evidence linking excessive phone use with motor dysfunctions and pain			0
‘ more research is still needed to unravel the consequences of the altered sensory processing linked to the use of touchscreen devices			0

people who use touchscreens daily have a larger somatosensory cortex
this is the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs
@entity46 team tracked 37 volunteers over ten days - 27 of them using touchscreen phones , and 11 using traditional mobiles with fixed buttons
during these tests , researchers monitored each user *'s* brain waves
those using touchscreen phones had altered the function of their cortex
