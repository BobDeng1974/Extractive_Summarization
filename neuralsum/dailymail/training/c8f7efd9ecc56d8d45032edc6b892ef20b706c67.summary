by @entity0 stay optimistic : @entity1 will be told to resist copying @entity2 , in light of a @entity5 triumph in the @entity6 by - election @entity1 will today be told to stick to an ‘ optimistic ’ message and resist becoming ‘ @entity2 - lite ’ after his party successfully defended a by - election seat for the first time in 25 years			1
conservative candidate @entity12 held off the threat of a @entity2 ‘ earthquake ’ , winning @entity6 with a reduced majority of 7,403			1
it was the first time the @entity17 have successfully defended a seat in a by - election since @entity20 won in @entity21 , @entity22 , in 1989			2
@entity2 ’s candidate @entity23 surged from a distant fourth in 2010 to second , but with 25 per cent of the vote he failed in his party ’s aim of reaching 30 per cent			1
mr @entity23 admitted yesterday that the failure of ‘ box office ’ party leader @entity28 to campaign hard in the @entity31 constituency may have impacted on the result – less than a fortnight after @entity2 topped the @entity35 elections poll			1
today a senior @entity5 minister will claim the campaign tactic of concentrating on the ‘ long - term economic plan ’ had been the right one			1
in a speech entitled reasons to be cheerful , @entity41 minister @entity40 will say : ‘ what @entity6 tells us is that the temptation to become @entity2 - lite should be firmly resisted			1
' the political battle of our times is between optimists and pessimists			0
conservatives should be optimists believing that free markets and a strong society are the basis for a successful country in this century			0
’ @entity2 ’s rise in support pushed @entity59 into third place , while @entity62 support was obliterated – leaving their candidate trailing in sixth place			1
@entity66 ’s party saw its vote share fall – a disappointing result less than a year from a general election in a constituency the party won during @entity73 ’s first landslide in 1997			0
in a sign of the depth of concern in the @entity5 camp over the possibility of losing , the prime minister hit the campaign trail in @entity6 four times			1
victory : @entity12 , centre , was elected mp for @entity6 in @entity31 , beating @entity2 's @entity23 , left mr @entity28 accused the @entity17 of running a ‘ nasty ’ campaign , but insisted his party had still achieved one of its best by - election results			1
@entity28 ’s lack of appeal to female voters helped the @entity17 win in @entity6 , a survey found			2
a poll before the election showed the parties neck - and - neck among men while nearly three times as many women would vote @entity5 compared to @entity2			2
it found 36.8 per cent of men planned to vote for @entity2 ’s @entity23 , with 36.2 per cent backing @entity5 @entity12			1
but only 16.8 per cent of women backed @entity2 , against 47.6 per cent intending to vote @entity5			2
‘ i think there ’ll be an awful lot of conservatives with a majority of less than 10,000 who will look upon this result in sheer horror , ’ he said			0
‘ for @entity2 , it ’s still a good night ’s work			2
’ experts said that @entity6 – together with the recent local and @entity35 elections – provided no evidence that @entity59 was on track to win an overall majority next may			2
@entity115 , professor of politics at @entity117 , said : ‘ @entity59 do not have the enthusiasm and depth of support in the electorate that make them look like an alternative government			0
' it is not the sign of a party making progress , but a party which seems to be in retreat , and now retreating so far that if it goes any further there will be question marks about its ability to win the next election			0
’ @entity135 ’s @entity62 garnered just 1,004 votes and 2.6 per cent of the vote – bad enough for it to lose its deposit for the ninth by - election since joining the @entity141			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ we need to work between now and the election to say very clearly we have got a long - term plan , we are getting @entity143 back to work , we are cutting people ’s taxes , we are helping hard - working people			0
the job is n’t finished yet but we are on the right track , let ’s stick at it			0
’ @entity154 as his party suffered in @entity6 , mr @entity135 looked like he had n't a care in the world as he fooled around for the cameras at a book launch for @entity160			0
@entity161 : @entity135 leaves @entity160 's book launch in @entity163 , @entity164			0
