by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 06:13 est , 24 may 2013 a new @entity2 television advert is outraging rights groups for both women and men , being slammed as sexist from both sides			1
the commercial - which advertises the brand 's @entity8 , which turns any @entity2 into an internet - ready @entity10 - portrays men as useless , loutish neanderthals ... and women as pushovers who put up with such behaviour			1
slammed by critics as ' offensive ' , ' man - hating ' , and ' feminist porn ' , the @entity17 ? advert , released on @entity20 networks , has still had almost 10 million views on @entity2 's @entity25 channel			1
she envisages her husband making breakfast while doing the ironing , cleaning the kitchen , looking after the baby , baking cakes , playing the flute and plaiting her hair while serving a romantic candlelit dinner , to the upbeat jazzy tones of @entity51 by @entity52 , with the lyrics : ' if you want the love of a real good man , come and get it '			1
when the downtrodden wife flickers out of her merry daydream she finds her gassy partner back on the sofa , dead eyes locked on tv , turning their living room into a stinking cesspit of crumbs and idiocy			2
@entity69 users have been appalled , and a men 's rights forum on @entity71 features comments about the ' blatantly sexist ' bent of the advert			2
a user called @entity75 writes : ' that 's probably one of the most vile adverts i 've ever seen			0
this is n't the normal iv drip of laughing at men ; this is simply mainlining outright contempt			0
another , @entity85 , complains : ' i find this advert quite sexist			0
the idea of an ' evolved man ' is basically making him the stereotype of a woman			2
this is n't evolution rather than devolution			0
' if this advert had the women being attached to some machine to make her better equipped to clean / cook / look after children / make her loving to her spouse / partner , there would be an outcry from feminists about equality			0
' after being plugged into the @entity8 , the husband is an all - singing , all - domesticated ' perfect ' man , capable of cooking , cleaning and caring for the children at the same time while some @entity25 comments beneath the video say ' people ca n't take a joke ' , other viewers are swearing off @entity2 products , labelling the commercial ' offensive ' and ' feminist porn '			1
but it is n't only men who are upset by the advert , which portrays women as downtrodden mugs who put up with men who behave like this			0
on @entity124 , one comment reads : ' yeah , it sucks that men are presented as useless lumps of farting meat who ca n't do anything in their families			0
' it also sucks that women are routinely presented as f * * * ing putting up with it as if it 's a given that a man would be a manchild whom you 'd have to clean up after and do everything for			2
it 's almost like an excuse for men to be useless			0
' @entity2 had yet to comment at time of publication			1
the ' evolutionary husband ' cooks , cleans and romances his wife while baking cakes and creating statues out of playing cards			1
