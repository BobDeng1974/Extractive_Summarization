by @entity0 for @entity1 as far as hat - tricks go , they do n't get much better than this			1
teenager @entity5 nets a basketball in his back garden in @entity10 , @entity9 no less than three times by performing a back - flip in a variety of positions			1
first up , a pal throws the basketball at the 17 - year - old 's feet and he times it just right to back - flip , kick the ball , then score			1
next , the teen bounces on a trampoline with the ball between his feet before flipping over and hurling it straight into the net			2
and last up , @entity5 takes a run at the net , back - flips with the ball in his hand , shoots , then scores			1
the trampoline trick shot went viral last year and has attracted more than 200,000 hits along with 7,000 subscribers who tune into @entity35 to see his skilful shots			2
high school student @entity5 said : ' i started developing my acrobatic skills by teaching myself a variety of flips and moves on the trampoline			1
' then once i had mastered that trick , i 'd do them on the ground			0
' after doing thousands of flips , it was quite easy to start incorporating basketball shots into them			0
@entity5 , 17 , from @entity9 , shows of his skills as he nets this ball while doing a back - flip ' my first video got hundreds of thousands of views , so i decided to make more videos of other shots just like it			1
' @entity5 says it takes two days to create each video and get the shot right exactly right			2
he said : ' first i have to come up with the idea , then make sure it is actually possible to do			0
' then i have to practice the flip enough so that i actually feel comfortable doing it with a ball in my hands or feet and feel confident enough to make the shot			0
' then we have to film it which can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how the shot goes			0
on average around an hour in a half to make the trickiest shots			0
