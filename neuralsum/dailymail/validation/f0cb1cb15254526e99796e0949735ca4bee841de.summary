@entity0 faced a backlash last year for forcing users to download a separate messenger app for mobile , and it looks like the web version is heading in the same direction			1
the social network has launched @entity9 - a standalone site that lets users chat to @entity0 friends privately on a browser in the same way they can on the @entity16 app. for the time being users can still send , receive and view messages on @entity0 , and the site has not announced any current plans to remove this feature yet			1

' once logged in , people can dive directly into a dedicated desktop messaging experience , keeping their conversations going and picking up where they left off			0
' to use @entity9 , users log in with @entity0 credentials and the site will automatically import their contacts and current chats			1
these conversations are shown full screen , as opposed to the pop - up on @entity0 or the half screen view on the main @entity55 page			1
none of the other @entity0 buttons , including links to the @entity59 , are visible , but settings can be managed by clicking the gear icon in the top left - hand corner			2

users simply have to click on the ‘ calls ’ tab and choose a contact to phone a friend at no cost			0
however this only works between @entity68 users and it relies on an internet connection			0
@entity94 , principal mobile analyst at @entity95 told @entity36 that by splitting @entity0 services , it reduces the different ways in which the site has to handle messages in its standard app and site			1
‘ with a portfolio of apps , there ’s more room to manoeuvre ; you do n’t have to use @entity0 anymore , ' he added			2
the standalone site is the latest addition to the much - maligned service			1
at its @entity112 conference in @entity113 last month , @entity0 boss @entity110 announced it was turning messenger into a platform for ' e-commerce , video and more '			1
during the event @entity0 executives introduced more than 25 tools tailored to help developers ' build , grow , and monetise ' mobile applications			2
messenger was also upgraded to let users share photos , audio and videos , and make calls more easily			2
' they are trying to make messenger a full - featured and rich media platform , ' @entity131 analyst @entity130 said at the conference			0
' i think that they are interested in letting people know that @entity0 is not a single app company , it is an app constellation			1
' users log in with their @entity0 credentials and the site automatically imports their contacts and current chats			1
these conversations are shown full screen			0
no other @entity0 buttons , including links to the @entity59 , are visible , but settings ( pictured ) can be managed using the gear icon in the top left - hand corner @entity9 is the latest addition to the much - maligned service			1
at its @entity112 conference in @entity113 last month , @entity0 boss @entity110 ( pictured ) announced it was turning @entity16 application into a platform for ' e-commerce , video and more ' in a bid to shake up online communication ' voice calling has been ramping up , and by separating [ messenger ] , @entity0 can make this feature available			1
it would be too cumbersome to add to the standard site , ' continued mr @entity94			0
' this also makes voicecalling easier to deploy in other countries			0
' @entity0 - owned @entity68 started rolling out its own internet calls to @entity73 users this week , and the feature is coming to @entity76 ' soon			1
' one of the messenger upgrades was designed to connect customers with companies , called @entity176			0
' we 're making messenger a place where you can easily communicate with the businesses you care about in addition to the people you care about , ' mr @entity110 said			0

and @entity16 can now be used for making payments to friends ( right ) and early last month @entity0 announced @entity16 can be used for making payments to friends , and that it was testing a ' buy ' button to allow users to make purchases directly from @entity0 pages			1
elsewhere , the messenger team is working with partners including @entity205 and the @entity207 film production company owned by @entity209 director @entity208 to release applications that work on the messenger platform			0
additionally , @entity0 introduced a tool designed to make it easy to take public video posted on the social network and embed it on other sites			0
@entity0 launched @entity16 back in 2011 but split the app from @entity0 at the start of last year and forced people to download both apps if they wanted to use the two services			2
one of these messenger upgrades was designed to connect customers with companies ( example pictured ) , called @entity176			0
' we 're making messenger a place where you can easily communicate with the businesses you care about in addition to the people you care about , ' mr @entity110 said at the time , members said they were outraged by the changes and flocked to the respective app stores to complain			0
they were also concerned about the app ’s permissions that gave @entity0 access to send texts and make calls on the user ’s device			1
@entity0 was then forced to respond with a blog post explaining why it needed certain permissions			0
it said : ‘ almost all apps need certain permissions to run on @entity73 , and we use these permissions to run features in the app. ‘ keep in mind that @entity73 controls the way the permissions are named , and the way they ’re named does n’t necessarily reflect the way the @entity16 app and other apps use them			0

@entity9 is a standalone site that lets you chat to @entity0 friends
you can chat and send files in the same way you can on messenger app
users can still send , receive and view messages on @entity0
and it is not known yet whether this feature will be removed in due course
