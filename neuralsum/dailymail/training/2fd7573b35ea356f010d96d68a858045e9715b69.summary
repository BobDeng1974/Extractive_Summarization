abortion counselor @entity8 said she wanted to use her abortion as a *teaching* tool for *female* patients
said she chose to *undergo* a surgical procedure - where the patient is awake and local anesthesia is used - after she had *trouble* finding a video of one being performed online and to dispel myths about the experience
only her face and upper body are *visible* in the video , and after the procedure is over @entity168 says ' i *'m* done . *yay* ! '
