@entity0 had all but given up on @entity6 when he was sent on loan to @entity8 before @entity9 and did not expect @entity5 to progress with such speed after a year at @entity11			1
‘ honestly , i could n’t say that in my head @entity6 was one of the first - choice players , ’ said the @entity2 manager			1
‘ but my job is to remain open - minded and make decisions when you have to			0
@entity6 ( right ) has played a vital role in @entity2 's late push for the @entity4 title ‘ @entity5 is one of the surprises of the season			1
he was at @entity11 on loan last year and did n’t get the games			0

’ @entity29 full - back @entity5 scored his second @entity2 goal against @entity31 , on saturday , a wonderful curling left - footer to break the deadlock and launch his team towards a 4 - 1 win			1
he was also responsible for keeping @entity36 under control when @entity38 came off the bench at half - time and @entity31 reshuffled			1
‘ he played against a great player in @entity36 , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i selected him because of his pace			0
i thought @entity38 would play and @entity36 would be on the flank			0

@entity5 celebrates scoring @entity2 's first goal during the 4 - 1 victory against @entity31 @entity5 broke the @entity50 deadlock for @entity2 , cutting in and curling a left - foot strike into the corner @entity0 admits he did n't expect @entity5 and @entity6 to be playing such key roles ‘ maybe he still has some experience to gain but his defending one - against - one is good and going forward he is good			1
he scored an important goal in a big game and that always shows that the guy has the mental quality to be there			2
’ the @entity2 boss did admit @entity5 might have been lucky not to be sent off , having been already booked when he mistimed a slide tackle on @entity36 and conceded a penalty , scored by @entity63			1
‘ he was a bit lucky there , ' said @entity0			2
‘ he could have got one but i think he genuinely went for the ball			0
i was just thinking : what do i do if he gets a second yellow ? in the end the referee decided not to give him a yellow because he went for the ball			0
he was unlucky for the first yellow			0
