@entity1 ’s much anticipated autobiography is published on monday and @entity2 cricket waits to see the extent of his score - settling at the end of a chequered international career			1
yet @entity1 seems intent on avoiding difficult questioning , with no press conference planned for the cricketing media and one - on - one interviews being refused , even to the likes of respected @entity14 correspondent @entity13			1
here , cricket correspondent @entity15 asks the questions that , with respect to @entity18 and the presenters of @entity20 , he is unlikely to face			2
why have you fallen out throughout your career with significant people wherever you have played — a pattern that began in your native @entity26 , carried on in @entity2 club cricket with @entity28 and continued at @entity29 , @entity30 and , it is suggested now , @entity31 ? most significantly , of course , there is @entity34			1
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , to name but five , are all good , team - oriented people who have the best interests of @entity2 cricket very much in their hearts			1
can they all be wrong and you be right ? why is it always you ? @entity1 ’s autobiography is published on monday and @entity2 cricket eagerly awaits its release @entity2 cricket is waiting to see the extent of his score - settling at the end of a chequered international career and just what has happened at @entity31 ? the bottom line is that you have been released and there is very little prospect of you playing at @entity57 next year			1
yet a magnificent piece of spinning in a @entity1 - friendly paper last week suggested that it is all a ploy to dash the hopes of the bad old @entity61 to fine you			2
pull the other one , @entity63			0
if you had scored more runs or shown any enthusiasm for county cricket , maybe played the odd first - class match , your argument that you want to play for @entity34 again would have some substance			2
as it is , it seems even your old mentor @entity71 has been frustrated at your lack of desire to work at your batting this year			0
and what about the suggestion that you have somehow won the ‘ pr battle ’ this season ? if so , why did large sections of the sell - out crowd at @entity81 for @entity83 finals day roundly boo you while treating your old adversary @entity84 , for instance , as a returning hero ? more pertinently , @entity36 has had complete support at every ground he has played throughout the summer , most notably at the @entity89 where he received standing ovations when he went out to bat and when he was undefeated in the 40s at lunch			1
yes , there was sympathy in january at the way it all ended for a player who touched greatness but that was quickly dissipated by your willingness to allow @entity102 to be your mouthpiece			0
you sitting there with @entity102 at @entity106 while he tweeted about @entity36 being ‘ a weasel ’ was a low point			2
@entity1 has been released and there is very little prospect of him playing at the @entity57 next year @entity1 bats for @entity31 during a @entity113 match against @entity114 at @entity57 in june 2014 @entity115 revealed @entity1 sent derogatory messages to @entity26 opponents about @entity37 the biggest question , of course , is @entity115 ’s revelation from 2012 that you sent derogatory messages to @entity26 opponents about your captain @entity37			1
why on earth did you do that ? and why , if they were just ‘ banter ’ between old friends , have you consistently refused to show them to the @entity61 ever since or properly to apologise for your actions ? that really should have been the end of the road with @entity34 for you , we all know that now , but then we would have been denied your incredible century in @entity137 that went a long way towards securing an historic series win in @entity140			2
that ’s the thing , you see @entity63 , there ’s always that contradiction and frustration with you			0
your relationship with @entity34 fell apart during that 2012 summer and your behaviour during and after the @entity148 was bizarre to say the least			0
you went out of your way to mix with the @entity26 on the field in training and at intervals rather than your team - mates			0
you did not acknowledge the applause from the @entity34 dressing room when you scored a century — another world - class knock , by the way — and then there was the dressing room incident involving @entity160			0
a glum - looking @entity1 has been a controversial figure for @entity34 on and off the cricket pitch what did you say behind his back that so annoyed your team - mates ? why did you say ‘ it ’s tough being me ’ after that game ? and while we are at it what did you say about @entity172 behind his back in the @entity175 dressing room as @entity34 crumbled to that 5 - 0 @entity176 thrashing ? you had a horrible habit of undermining inexperienced team - mates when the going got tough			1
it is widely understood that @entity36 played a huge part in convincing the @entity61 to take you back after the text scandal but what is not as well documented is that it was mainly @entity35 who persuaded @entity34 to give you another chance			1
@entity1 has had a chequered international past and his autobiography may include a spot of score - settling @entity1 had his feuds with @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 are you really going to make @entity35 the no 1 target in your book after all he did for you — and more importantly , for @entity34 ? you wanted him sacked along with @entity38 in 2008 , a move that was to catastrophically backfire			1
why did you feel so strongly that @entity38 and @entity35 had to go ? @entity35 still worked with you and managed you after that and then agreed to have you back in 2012 even though he felt personally let down by your betrayal of @entity37			1
it is difficult to see how he has wronged you			0
let ’s go back to one of the most controversial episodes in recent cricket history , the @entity204 affair			0
to be fair , you conducted yourself as @entity34 captain as well as could be hoped as the team were effectively hired out to a crooked @entity207			0
much was made of the winner - takes - all aspect of the week in @entity210 and we all know the @entity34 players won nothing while the @entity215 team walked off with a million dollars each			0
it is not as well documented that @entity35 ( right ) persuaded @entity34 to give @entity1 another chance @entity1 wanted @entity35 sacked along with @entity38 ( left ) in 2008 , a move that backfired catastrophically but did you have a separate agreement with @entity215 to promote the whole tawdry business ? if so , did you hand back the money once it was found to be ill - gotten gains by @entity215 ? what did you think when @entity224 said in his autobiography that you were never the right man to captain @entity34 ? and did you really think @entity224 and other @entity34 players like @entity227 were involved in that fake ‘ @entity230 ’ @entity229 account that seemed to offend you so much			1
what about when @entity224 said , after his retirement in @entity234 , that ‘ some players are up their own backside ’ and show a lack of humility ? ‘ it will bite them on the a * * * one day and when it does i hope they are embarrassed about how they carry on , ’ @entity224 said about the unnamed player or players			0
who do you think he was talking about ? finally @entity63 , why did you walk out of that last meeting with @entity36 and @entity247 when they told you about your deselection , rather than hang around to hear the reasons and talk it through ? @entity36 wanted to have a full discussion on where it had all gone wrong but you did not give him a chance , instead getting your mate @entity102 to suggest @entity36 would n’t front up			2
the same cheerleader later misinterpreted the pivotal @entity259 team meeting and made groundless accusations about @entity39 attacking @entity35 when you know he did nothing of the sort			2
confidentiality agreement , anyone ? the fact is your departure has been horrible and nasty			0
there ’s only one person to blame for that , @entity63			0
it ’s not @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , prior , @entity272 , @entity224 , @entity38 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 or anyone at @entity30 and @entity31			1
@entity36 ( right ) wanted to discuss where it went wrong with @entity1 , but he refused to do so			1

@entity1 releases his autobiography on monday and @entity2 cricket eagerly wants to know if any burning questions will finally be answered
@entity1 has been avoiding difficult questioning with no press conferences for cricketing media and one - on - one interviews being refused
@entity1 has fallen out with significant people wherever he has played
can @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 - to name just five - be wrong about @entity1 ?
