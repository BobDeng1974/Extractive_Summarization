by @entity0 a familiar face in high - quality period dramas , actress @entity1 is not the obvious choice for a debate on violence in films			1
but following her decision to take on the role of @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 yesterday revealed that even she was disturbed by the scenes of brutality in the film			1
and the @entity17 - nominated star was further appalled that it was given a 12 rating in @entity20 – a decision she said was made purely to make money and that she would never allow her 12 - year - old son to watch it			1
the mother - of - three whose youngest child is son @entity47 , 14 , said that the viewing public in general have become more difficult to shock : ‘ i found [ the film ] incredibly violent , and i was very disturbed by the fact that in @entity20 it was given the official seal of approval that any child over the age of 12 could see it			1
that was just the producer wanting to make more money , but it was irresponsible			0
there is no way my 12 - year - old son would see that film			2
‘ i think [ the level of violence in films ] is disturbing			2
people should be more affected			2
i think people are getting more and more used to violence , violent images and sexual images			1
we ’re so used to using the word “ f * * k ” now			0
’ in her interview with @entity76 the 54 - year - old said that she has seen first - hand how violent films can encourage violent behaviour in children : ‘ i ’ve seen with my own eyes that more than 20 minutes in front of a screen playing a game is very bad for children			1
' it ’s because they have this idea that they ’re all powerful , and that they ’re running the world when they ’re playing this game , and they find it hard to relate to authority after that			0
i ’ve found that with my own children			0
they ca n’t stand being frustrated because they ca n’t do this or that , but a few minutes before their thumbs were ruling the world			0
’ winning her first major role as heiress @entity109 , opposite prince , in 1986 ’s under the @entity111 , @entity12 rose to international fame in the @entity113 with @entity114 and @entity115			2
@entity12 rose to international fame in the @entity113 with @entity114 and @entity115 ( above with @entity116 ) her role as @entity119 , alongside @entity120 , in @entity121 in 1996 led to an @entity17 nomination and she recently shared the screen with @entity120 once more in @entity124 , playing the concerned mother of @entity127 ’s teenage lover			2
she said she took the part of @entity10 to push the boundaries once more : ‘ you have to try new things because otherwise it just gets dull			0
that ’s one of the reasons why i did @entity136 ’s film because no one has ever asked me to do anything like that before			0
what i hate doing is repeating something i have already done			0
i want to be a bit dangerous , otherwise it ’s not fun			0
’ a record number of films were rated 12a last year , raising concerns that more and more children are being exposed to scenes of violence and sex			1
in 2013 , 321 films were given the classification , up by a third from 234 the previous year			0
the rating means children aged 12 and over can see a film unaccompanied - and those under 12 can view it if with an adult			1
it also emerged yesterday that @entity163 ’s hit @entity161 , originally rated @entity32 , prompted the most complaints to the @entity32 last year			0
the ‘ violent , dark and sadistic ’ thriller , which sees a man shoot dead five people , had been cut to get it down to the @entity32 rating but still generated 26 complaints			1
@entity171 , @entity172 , other 12 and 12a films , generated protests about strong language and sexual references .			1

@entity178 was given an 18 *certificate* in @entity180 and an r - rating in the @entity39 but 12 for @entity20 cinemas
@entity12 believes people are more used to violence , violent and sexual images
thinks that violent films encourage children to act in a violent way
