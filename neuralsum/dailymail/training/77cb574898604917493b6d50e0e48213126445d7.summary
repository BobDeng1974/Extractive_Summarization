more than 100,000 homeowners across the country face an average bill of £ 15,000 a year thanks to @entity5 ’s mansion tax , experts said yesterday			1
the @entity7 leader told his party conference he would impose the levy on homes worth £ 2 million to free up billions for the @entity11			1
but the plan has already come under fire from @entity7 candidates to be @entity16 mayor , because the tax will disproportionately affect homeowners in the capital			1
but the plan has already come under fire one candidate dubbed mr @entity5 ’s flagship proposal a ‘ tax on @entity16 ’ , while another said it could force elderly people out of their homes			1
the @entity7 leader pledged that the threshold for paying the mansion tax will rise in line with average house prices , to ensure that more and more people are affected			1
but there are fears future @entity39 would be tempted to lower the starting point – so homes worth £ 1.5 million or even £ 1 million are dragged into the levy			2
@entity7 says the tax – a levy of 1 per cent on the additional value of homes above £ 2 million – will raise £ 1.2 billion a year , but property website @entity46 puts the figure at £ 1.6 billion			1
some 96 per cent of this would be paid by homeowners in @entity16 and the @entity51			0
overall , the annual levy would hit 108,000 households across the @entity54 – at an average cost of £ 15,000			2
but last night @entity57 sources said the new tax would raise at least £ 350 million less than @entity7 claims because of a planned discount for those who live in high - value homes without enjoying a good income			1
up to one in four homeowners could be eligible for protection			0
@entity65 , of the @entity66 ’ @entity64 , said : ‘ a mansion tax is a vindictive gesture that will eventually find its way down the property ladder to hit much less expensive homes			0
labour leader pledged that the threshold for paying the mansion tax will rise in line with average house prices ‘ as with stamp duty , future @entity39 will be tempted to lower thresholds or freeze rates while house prices go up			1
this kind of on - the - hoof policy is nothing more than a populist gesture , but it will be extremely damaging for families up and down country			0
’ there is unease among @entity16 mayoral candidates that the tax will harm @entity7 ’s chances in the 2016 election and boost the @entity93 candidate who stands to succeed @entity94			1
the @entity46 statistics show that almost 85,500 homes worth £ 2 million are in the capital – 88 per cent of the total			0
in @entity16 , the average price of a home above £ 2million is £ 3.7 million , meaning the average annual bill would be £ 16,800			1
possible candidate @entity103 mp dubbed mr @entity5 ’s flagship proposala ‘ tax on @entity16 ’ by contrast , just 895 homes in @entity106 and 87 in @entity107 will be affected			1
@entity109 , from @entity46 , said : ‘ the introduction of a mansion tax would disproportionately penalise homeowners in @entity16 and the @entity51 who are already responsible for the vast majority of property tax take in the @entity54			2
’ the front - runner for @entity7 ’s mayoralty candidacy , mp @entity117 , attacked the mansion tax plan when it was mooted late last year			1
‘ i represent a constituency where it would be an issue for some people , ’ she said			0
‘ they are people who bought homes maybe 20 or 30 years ago for a fraction of what they are worth now			0
they are people maybe becoming elderly who are asset - rich and income - poor			0
it ’s fine to say we ’ll impose a mansion tax , but for these people they would have to move out of their family homes			2
’ @entity103 , another possible candidate , said the proposal felt ‘ like a tax on @entity16 ’ , while @entity138 mp @entity137 – who has already launched his campaign – said it was ‘ clearly a tax on @entity16 ’			1
the property industry came out strongly against the proposal			0
@entity143 , managing director of the @entity144 , said : ‘ imposing a mansion tax on @entity16 does not make sense			2
it will reduce house - building and limit growth			0
it is a tax on aspiration			0
’ a @entity7 source said it was likely that people would self - assess whether their home was worth more than £ 2 million , with this being checked by the @entity157			2
further details of the mansion tax will be unveiled in the months ahead			0
@entity5 will fall victim to his own mansion tax – because he lives in a house worth £ 2.6 million			1
the four - bedroom semi-detached home in @entity16 was bought five years ago for £ 1.6 million			2
along with his wife @entity165 , mr @entity5 bought the townhouse with a £ 400,000 mortgage			0
he contributes to the loan repayments , but his name is not on the deeds			0
according to property website @entity46 , it is now worth £ 2.6 million , meaning the couple face a mansion tax of £ 6,000 a year .			0

@entity5 told party conference he would impose levy on £ 2m homes
but plan to free up billions for @entity11 has already come under fire
one @entity7 candidate dubbed flagship proposal as a ' tax on @entity16 '
@entity5 pledged threshold will rise in line with average house prices
