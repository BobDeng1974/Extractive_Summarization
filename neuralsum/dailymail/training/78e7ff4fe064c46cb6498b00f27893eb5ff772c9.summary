the broadcasting regulator has criticised @entity1 after one of its star reporters was seen picking through the possessions of people killed when flight @entity6 was shot down over @entity8			1
@entity9 said more than 200 people complained after @entity11 rifled through the victims ' bags at the crash scene in july this year , three days after the @entity16 passenger jet was taken down with the loss of all 298 people on board			1
today the regulator said the live television broadcast on 20 july caused ' considerable offence ' and breached its rule that says offensive material must be justified by the context			1
' it described how he suggested the items belonged to ' a small girl ... by the look of things ' before almost immediately adding : ' we should n't really be doing this , i suppose '			2
the @entity9 investigation said : ' mr @entity11 handled two items belonging to a victim of the crash very briefly , and he appeared to almost immediately regret his actions and expressed this to viewers			2
' nonetheless , in @entity9 's view these actions were capable of causing considerable offence and this was not mitigated by an immediate broadcast apology			1
' on balance we therefore considered that the offence was not justified by the context and @entity70 was breached			0
' however the watchdog said the breach was considered resolved after @entity11 , 46 , and @entity1 apologised hours after the broadcast , and the reporter wrote a full apology in a newspaper two days later			1
doomed : @entity16 flight @entity78 as it took off from @entity81 airport in @entity81 on 17 july 2014 @entity9 said it also took into account the ' unusual and emotionally charged situation ' @entity11 found himself reporting on , and said that it meant he had to take ' particularly challenging ' editorial decisions			1
after the event @entity11 , a father of six , said he spotted the pink drinking flask because it was identical to one possessed by his six - year - old daughter			0
he then said he ' lost it ' and broke down in tears while on air as he looked at the victims ' possessions			0
however the older brother of @entity95 student @entity94 , who was one of ten @entity96 to die in the crash , said the television reporter 's actions were ' sick '			0
speaking soon after the broadcast this summer , @entity100 , 24 , said : ' it 's sick and the worst example of news journalism which is sensationalising an appalling human tragedy			0
' @entity11 is described by @entity1 as one of its ' most widely travelled ' reporters who has previously been honoured for his reporting in @entity110			0
@entity111 also said that @entity11 's ' brief but significant lapse of judgement ' should not prevent broadcast journalists from reporting on live and sensitive news stories in future .			2

@entity11 reported live for @entity1 from the site in *eastern* @entity8
experienced reporter picked up bottle and keys from small girl 's suitcase
he almost immediately said : ' we should n't really be doing this , i suppose '
broadcast regulator @entity9 said it received 205 complaints from viewers
ruled that @entity1 breached @entity9 rule by not justifying offensive material
watchdog said ' these actions were capable of causing considerable offence '
but it said the complaint was resolved after @entity11 and @entity1 apologised
