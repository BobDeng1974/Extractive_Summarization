if @entity1 was from @entity2 , he might sound a little like @entity3			1
the @entity5 singer has become an internet sensation in the @entity7 after users discovered one of his videos and spread it across social networks			0
the general consensus is that it is awful			0
so awful , in fact , that it 's amazing			2
but having racked up in excess of 4.2million views , mr @entity3 is probably laughing along with his critics - and all the way to the bank			1
it 's my life : @entity24 sings in the video which has made him a worldwide musical sensation viral : mr @entity3 's @entity29 video has racked up more than 4million views since it was published in 2012 heartfelt : the 29 - year - old singer says he was inspired to write the song by his life experiences the song , it 's @entity35 ( what ever @entity36 ) , is a fairly catchy piece of @entity40 pop , in the style of early @entity42 , which mr @entity3 , 29 , describes as ' a non-fictional , psychological and philosophical song written by me â€™			1
in the song 's description on @entity29 , he goes on : ' my life inspired me to write the lyrics , lyrics inspired me to compose tune , lyrics and tune inspired me to @entity57			1
that 's what the actual happened to the " @entity61 "			2
' the words i penned for the lyrics of the @entity64 are genuinely written from the bottom of my heart which describes about " my attitude "			2
' the heartfelt slice of pop has been panned by critics , both professional and amateur			0
reporting on its going viral , a writer for @entity72 described it as both ' torturous ' and ' unmelodious '			2
' be assured the video is not being popularized due to his singing but instead for his audacity to sing , ' the reporter sniped			0
@entity29 commenters have not been any more charitable towards mr @entity3 's efforts			1
' he is one s * * * singer , ' remarked one user on the video sharing site			0
another wrote : ' @entity87 have the most retarded songs / voice i 've ever heard			0
' brain eater ? some of the phrases used in mr @entity3 's song do not translate well to @entity95 audiences having fun in the studio : mr @entity3 sites with producers as they lay down the music for his track indeed , it does appear from the undoubtedly heartfelt lyrics that @entity104 is not mr @entity3 's mother tongue			1
' people think i am somewhat mental / they do n't know i am very sentimental , ' he sings			0
' friend of mine says i am a waste fellow / he do n't know the taste of this fellow			0
' but mr @entity3 has taken a philosphical attitude towards the haters - or ' hell wishers ' as he dubs them			1
a post on his @entity118 account about all the attention it 's my life has attracted reads : ' my @entity121 helped to make this ... ' my @entity123 helped to make it as @entity125 ... ' my fans helped to make it a @entity125 ... ' now everyone helped in making it as a sensation ... ' indeed , with @entity29 reportedly paying video contributors as between $ 2.50 and $ 5 per thousand views , that means that mr @entity3 may have made at least $ 10,000 from it 's my life			1
and that can go a long way in @entity2 .			0

@entity3 's song it 's my life has had more than 4million @entity29 views
but *unsympathetic* critics have *slammed* it as ' unmelodious ' and ' torturous '
mr @entity3 takes a philosophical attitude to the haters - or ' hell wishers '
