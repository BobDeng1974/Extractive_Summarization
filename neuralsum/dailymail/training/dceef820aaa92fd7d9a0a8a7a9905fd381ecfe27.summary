@entity0 has hailed the past two years as the best of his life after concluding two days of celebrations with everyone at @entity5 following their success in winning the @entity10 constructors ' title			1
the team , primarily based in @entity12 , with the power - unit department 28 miles away in @entity14 , has been savouring the fruits of five years of hard work since @entity5 bought out @entity17 at the end of 2009			1
the team 's ninth one - two of the season in @entity20 on sunday - one shy of @entity23 's 1988 record - and spearheaded by @entity0 's ninth win this campaign , ensured @entity5 became champions in style for the first time in @entity10 history			1
the 29 - year - old then said : ' what an incredible feeling it is to be stood in front of all these incredible people			1
' you almost have to take a step back and just think about what we 've achieved together			0
' i know it 's been a long road and many of the team have had to work through tough times to lay the foundations for what we 're seeing today , and i 'm incredibly grateful for all of their hard work			2
' these past two years have been the best of my life - and that 's all down to everybody standing here			0
' the effort and the synergy here is unlike anything i 've ever seen and i 'm excited for the future			0
' the @entity79 will now try to secure the individual title ahead of team - mate @entity38 - he is currently 17 points up @entity38 , co-team boss @entity82 , @entity0 and @entity85 ' @entity84 wave from the podium in @entity87 the short - term aim , though , is now the drivers ' crown , with @entity0 17 points clear of @entity38 following a dramatic turnaround in results over the past four races			1
at least the party atmosphere diverted the attentions of both drivers from their primary goal for a short period			0
@entity38 , who has been with @entity5 since they first returned to the sport in 2010 , said : " so this is it - we 're actually standing here now as world champions ! ' this has been a long time coming			1
since i joined at the start of this project i expected this day to come as i 've had such strong belief in this group of people from right back on day one			0
' to be a part of that and to have finally achieved this championship in such dominant fashion is a great feeling			0
the entire @entity5 team was delighted as they finally wrapped up the constructors ' title in @entity87 @entity0 says he is enjoying the best years of his life as part of the @entity5 team he joined two years ago ' i 'd like to say a big thank you to everyone for all their hard work			1
' i hope they can really enjoy this moment , that there will be many more great moments to come and that this is just the beginning of a long era of success for the @entity134			0
' @entity5 motorsport boss @entity135 rightly acknowledged the work done by @entity137 as it was he who set the ball rolling			2
following their double triumph in 2009 , it was @entity137 's team @entity5 bought out , and then it was he who led a recruitment drive to ensure the marque had the right personnel in place to become champions			2
@entity137 , though , was forced out at the end of last year , but in paying tribute , @entity135 said : ' winning the first constructors ' championship for @entity154 is a moment of immense pride for all of us			0
@entity0 lifts the trophy on the podium after winning in @entity87 - there are just three races left of the season the start - to - finish win for @entity0 in @entity87 was impressive - and pushed him further ahead of @entity38 ' this is the moment to recognise everybody involved in that team effort - starting with @entity137 , who was an inspiring figure at the team and laid the foundations for our current success			1
' i thank each and every one of these great people for their involvement in what we have achieved and raise a toast to their efforts - the best of the best			0
' non-executive chairman @entity181 , meanwhile , knows the real hard work has only just started as the team set their sights on repeating such success again and again			0
' we have three more races and we must keep on pushing to make sure our drivers have an equal chance to win their title , ' said @entity181			2
' then we must push even harder to keep winning year after year - and it will only get tougher , but i believe we have the people to do that			2
' @entity0 launches a shower of champagne after wrapping up his latest race win mercedes say they will do everything to help the drivers win the title - which gets the thumbs up from @entity0			1
