for any players who have featured for 90 minutes in a match under @entity2 , the next day at training is dedicated to ‘ scarico ’ — recovery			1
try telling that to @entity7			2
@entity2 was the manager who brought @entity7 into @entity9 ’s first team in 2008 after he had been signed from @entity11 club side @entity10 two years earlier			1
@entity9 had @entity14 internationals @entity12 , @entity15 and @entity16 vying for places up front , but @entity2 knew in @entity7 he had a ‘ jewel ’ on his hands			1
@entity7 has impressed for @entity21 this season following his £ 30million switch from @entity23 @entity2 , pictured managing @entity24 in 2013 , brought @entity7 into the @entity9 first team in 2008 the main problem he encountered , however , was that he could not keep @entity7 off the pitch			1
‘ @entity7 could easily play three matches per day , ’ @entity2 , now in charge of @entity30 , said			1
‘ as soon as the ( training ) match started , @entity7 used to abandon the scarico and would run up to me , almost imploring : “ @entity35 , let me play , just for a few minutes			2
please , please , please			0
i promise i wo n’t get injured			0
” @entity36 is an enormous pleasure for him			0
’ that hunger earned him two £ 30million moves , first to @entity23 in 2011 and then to @entity21 last summer			1
it is also why @entity7 , @entity21 ’s stand - out player this season , found it so difficult when he was rested for two games by @entity44 — against @entity45 and @entity46 — with a sore hamstring			1
@entity7 spent five years with @entity48 side @entity9 before earning a move to @entity51 giants @entity23 @entity7 takes on defender @entity52 during @entity53 's friendly with @entity54 at the @entity55 last week ‘ putting him on the bench is like taking a toy from a child , ’ @entity2 warned			1
‘ there was just one thing that worried me when he joined @entity23 — they were full of amazing forwards and it was by no means a given that @entity7 would be in the starting 11			1
‘ since i know how important it is for him to play , i feared that without regular football he could become discouraged			0
but he proved he was good enough to become an essential part of the team and fitted into the @entity23 way of playing			0
’ big money moves have not sapped any of @entity7 ’s energy			0
speak to @entity21 players and they describe the same enthusiasm in training , the same refusal to embrace rest days , the same disregard for ‘ scarico			2
’ @entity7 found it difficult when he had to be rested for @entity21 's matches with @entity45 and @entity46 they warned him that when the games rained down over the winter it would soon catch up with him , but @entity7 , bar that short @entity44 - enforced break , has not stopped , even if he has n’t been as prolific as he was in the first half of the season			1
that is why @entity2 believes @entity7 , still only 26 , could elevate himself alongside the planet ’s greatest			2
‘ he ’s never looked as strong as he does now , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ personally , i think he could score more than 35 goals a season in any league he plays in			0
‘ if he succeeded in doing that , he would be at the same level as two monsters of the modern game : @entity95 and @entity96			0
nowadays only those two , and maybe @entity97 , can claim to be better than @entity7			0
’ @entity2 believes @entity7 is looking strong and capable of scoring 35 goals in any league he 's played in			2

@entity7 has starred for @entity23 and @entity21 since @entity9 days
former boss @entity2 has *tipped* the frontman for greatness
@entity2 says benching @entity7 was ' like taking a toy from a child '
