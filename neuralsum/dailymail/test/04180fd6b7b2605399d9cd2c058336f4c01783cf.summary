meanwhile nobody realistically expected @entity4 to escape their current predicament at the foot of the @entity129 ’s @entity6 and seven points from safety before this game			0
if they do it will represent a remarkable turnaround in results			0
the message pre-match from @entity11 and midfielder @entity60 was that if they could recapture the spirit they showed in a 4 - 3 defeat against @entity4 a fortnight ago they would overcome the @entity15			1
in starting the consistently lively @entity81 , an attacking intent was demonstrated and the home side were lively from the start			0
@entity92 , the 31 - year - old @entity146 , made several important clearances in the first ten minutes for @entity15 and the travelling fans responded with a chorus of ‘ he ’s the ginger @entity151			1
’ but it was as he retreated to goal that the ball ricocheted off his back and into the path of @entity80 who cooly put @entity4 ahead after 12 minutes			1
the ball bounced kindly for the @entity157 whose sublime right footed strike just outside the @entity159 sailed in			0
as his teammates rushed to celebrate , he showed a wise head by urging them to get back into position			0
@entity80 slides to his knees as he celebrates in front of the @entity4 fans following his opener for the relegation threatened foxes @entity83 draws a foul from @entity91 during the @entity6 match @entity4 and @entity15 moments later referee @entity112 made the right decision to award the home side a penalty after @entity91 brought down @entity83			1

they were left to rue the missed opportunity when the @entity15 pulled one back in the 32nd minute			0
@entity95 sent a floating ball into he box which soared over the head @entity183 and was controlled by @entity184 , the @entity74 firing low and powerfully into the bottom left corner past a helpless @entity52			0
@entity73 was close to doubling his goal tally in the 73rd minute , his shot from @entity100 ’s lay off hitting the post			2
meanwhile @entity60 had two good chances in as many minutes			0

@entity216 sides hit the post in the second half but it was @entity4 who earned a vital win thanks to @entity2
