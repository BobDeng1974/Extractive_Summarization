by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 09:51 est , 25 may 2013 a blogger whose reflections on terminal bone cancer inspired countless followers has lost her battle against the disease			1
three weeks ago @entity7 ran extracts from charity worker @entity10 's blog about her experience of having cancer			1
her moving and surprisingly humorous take on her bleak prognosis triggered an outpouring of emotion from readers			1
some blog followers even claimed to have made major life - changing decisions - such as moving across the country to be closer to family or changing career – after reading her inspiring words			1
but sadly @entity10 died last sunday and her husband @entity26 announced his loss by simply updating her blog with the words : ' my darling , beautiful wife and best friend 15.12.70 - 19.05.13xxxxxxxx ' @entity10 died on sunday 19 may after a ten - year battle with a rare bone cancer			1
her husband @entity36 announced his loss on her blog by simply posting the above image and writing : ' my darling , beautiful wife and best friend 15.12.70 - 19.05.13xxxxxxxx ' photographer @entity41 has also paid tribute to @entity10 on @entity43			1
he met her after she took part in one of his latest projects entitled ' alive '			2
' alive : in the face of @entity48 ' is an exhibition looking at the reality of death from all perspectives – from people who work in the death industry to those , like @entity10 , living with a terminal illness			1
the show opened at the @entity58 in @entity59 earlier this week			1
@entity41 wrote : ‘ i am very sad to say that @entity60 passed away peacefully yesterday morning			1
she was a shining light … i ca n't even begin to express my love and admiration for her			2
' it is rare that one subject has so much influence on you , but for me , @entity10 really did make a massive difference			1
her infectious love for life reminded us all to live our own lives to the fullest			1
it was husband @entity26 that suggested @entity10 start writing about her feelings about her terminal cancer diagnosis			1
she has had well - wishing messages from readers as far away @entity82 ' to cherish our own mortality and not be selfish or preoccupied with it			2
she was plain and direct about her feelings and taught me to focus on the good things and not dwell on the negatives of the day - to - day , or my own self obsessions			2
' talking to her made it so much easier to come to terms with the passing of my own parents			2
' her " after crying " image is one of my favourite photos ever			1
i 'm so proud to have helped her to create it			2
@entity41 's image of @entity10 for charity project alive is powerful and the photographer said it is one of his favourite photographs ever ' an all round lovely human being , which the world should have known for longer			1
it is with deep sadness that we all say goodbye to her			0
the word ' loss ' is just not enough			0
' to @entity111 , @entity60 's best friend and the love of her life , i know she 'll be there forever			0
all my love to you both			0
it was an honour to meet her and i 'll remember her forever			0
lots of love @entity41 x ’ @entity10 , 42 , from @entity124 was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer in december 2012 , just two weeks after her two - year wedding anniversary			1
she had been fighting a rare form of bone cancer called @entity129 in her left leg since 2004			1
@entity10 had a farewell party for her left leg ( left ) before it was amputated four years ago			1
she has documented much of her experience with photos , such as just before her leg was removed			2
the black arrow drawn on her leg indicates where surgeons should cut ( right ) @entity10 , pictured after her first amputation and second year of chemotherapy , in 2008 the cancer behaved very oddly and returned each time doctors tried to remove it , so in 2008 they were forced to amputate part of her leg			1
she underwent repeated cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in conjunction with the surgery but doctors had to amputate a further three times to stem the growth of the cancer			2
but just weeks after her two - year wedding anniversary with her husband , the couple were given the devastating news that she only had weeks to live			1
the cancer had spread to her lungs , next to her liver and where her ribs and shoulder blade meet			2
' we both kind of knew it would happen eventually but for a couple of weeks were in a bit of shock , ' said mr @entity26			2
' eventually , we pulled together and just decided to stay positive			0
@entity10 has been positive about her situation from the outset			1
' @entity36 , 45 , suggested she start writing about her experiences as a means to cope with the emotions she was experiencing			1
her musings and reflections on her life - past , present and future - culminated in her blog @entity176 , which quickly developed a worldwide following			2
she has had well - wishing messages from readers as far away as @entity180 , @entity82 and @entity181			0
outgoing : @entity10 is pictured having fun on a day out with a friend despite being diagnosed with terminal cancer ' one person even got in touch to say they 'd left their job after reading @entity10 's blog - they decided that life was too short not to do something that made them happy and changed career to be closer their family , ' said @entity36			1
here , with @entity10 's husband 's permission , @entity7 features @entity10 ' last blog entry			1
may - saying goodbye @entity201 ( or its many variations ) is a word we say all the time			2
when our partner leaves for work , when you leave the office for the day			0
@entity10 's health deteriorated but she tried to look on the bright side , saying she ' no longer needed to worry about a pension and now had more time to watch trashy daytime television ' @entity10 was keen to live as normally as possible despite her need for daily palliative treatment when it ’s time to leave the pub after perhaps one too many … but it ’s only when it ’s a harder goodbye that we really think about what we ’re saying			1
dropping someone you love off at the airport knowing you wo n’t see them again for months			0
that type of goodbye hits hard			0
but you do have the hope and belief that you will see that person again			0
but goodbye has changed for me lately …			0
i still have all the daily ‘ @entity231 , see you later ’ goodbyes for my friends and family			0
but then , there are the much harder goodbyes , where i know i wo n’t see that person again in this life			0
and over the last weeks i ’ve had to get through a few of those goodbyes as my friends from overseas have visited me ( you know who you are and i love you )			2
and it ’s so painful and so hard and heart - crushingly awful and feels so unfair			0
i ’m there hugging someone and not wanting to ever let go			0
and then they disappear around the side of our house and that ’s it			0
and there ’s no solution other than to sob			0
and then try and console myself with the existence of @entity260 and @entity261			0
tender moment : @entity10 and @entity36 hold hands			1
she said her disease made her treasure those close to her it all makes me wonder if we should consider our goodbyes more carefully , treat them more seriously			0
i used to have this silly superstition that i could never let someone go or say ‘ bye to them if there was some kind of negative feeling in the air ( we ’ve all slammed doors after an argument , or hung up on people we ’re angry with )			0
@entity10 said that by getting on with daily life - such as going out for lunch - she was able to forget about her bleak prognosis i ’m not a paranoid or superstitious person at all normally , but i hated the idea of that being our last goodbye somehow			1
so maybe that was my preparation for my current situation			0
who knows ? but i reckon it ’s worth thinking about what bye means to us all and seeing what we discover			0
anyhow , after thinking about what it means to me , i ’ve decided i prefer the @entity296 “ au revoir ” as with that there is hope that i shall see my loved ones again			0
maybe not in this life , but , if i ’m lucky , in the next			0
i can but hope .			0
