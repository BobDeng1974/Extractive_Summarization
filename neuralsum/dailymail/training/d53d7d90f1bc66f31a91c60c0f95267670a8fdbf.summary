by @entity0 the @entity1 inadvertently gave a terrorist leader the finances and credibility he needed to mastermind a major attack , claims a former spy			1
intelligence officer @entity7 from @entity8 was asked by the @entity1 to build a relationship with the head of militant group @entity11 , the group behind september 's attack , and handed over money and equipment on behalf of @entity16 intelligence agencies to cultivate the group 's trust			1
in 2008 he started to forge close contacts with the leader @entity20 , also known as @entity21 , in a bid to uncover information on potential targets and planned attacks			1
he then became involved in militant activities in @entity38 and forged links with fundamentalist leaders including @entity41 when @entity42 first met @entity43 he was a messenger for @entity44 , an @entity11 leader , according to a report by @entity46			1
their first encounter was at a @entity50 restaurant on the first floor of the @entity53 shopping mall next door to the main mosque in @entity56			1
two other jihadists were there with @entity43			0
storm was meeting with @entity43 in order to get messages and equipment to @entity63			0
storm was known to @entity65 and to @entity43 as a fellow jihadist			0
but the relationship broke down in 2012 when @entity42 left the @entity1 due to a ‘ disagreement over a mission ’ and he now claims the plan to provide @entity21 with money and equipment may have backfired spectacularly			2
he also believes that had his relationship with the @entity1 not faltered he could have helped capture or kill the man believed to have gone on to plan the september attack on @entity78			1
storm converted into to @entity35 after spending time in prison and developed extreme jihadist views and moved to @entity38 in 2001			2
he became trusted by fundamentalists and became involved in militant activities , including recruiting soldiers to fight in the @entity85			0
however he was recruited by the @entity1 , @entity86 and the @entity8 intelligence service , @entity87 , as a double agent to information on operations in @entity38 and @entity50 and prevent attacks in @entity92			1
when storm first met @entity21 , he was only a messenger for the jihadists and was sent to pick up an electronic device from the @entity8 agent by one of the groups then leaders			1
undercover : the former spy from @entity8 was working for numerous agencies including the @entity1 and @entity8 's @entity87 while he was trying to infiltrate militant groups in @entity38 storm became trusted by fundamentalists and became involved in militant activities , including recruiting soldiers to fight in the @entity85 as the relationship developed , @entity42 claims that the @entity1 , using him as a middle man , gave him resources , equipment and the authority he needed to mastermind a major terrorist attack , similar to the one in @entity56 which killed 67 people			1
storm , who has since retired from duty , told @entity46 that in march 2012 @entity87 had offered him one million @entity8 krone ( £ 125,000 ) to lead them to @entity120 on behalf of the @entity1			1
he was offered the job after he was paid £ 156,000 ( $ 250,000 ) to meet with @entity41 , an @entity35 militant who was killed in a drone strike in 2011			0
storm said @entity124 was at the centre of a global network connecting a number of terrorist operatives in @entity50 , @entity31 , @entity38 , and the @entity129 and had emerged as the chief handler of foreign fighters because of his language skills and level of education			1
even though @entity42 is not aware of the exact role @entity124 played in the attack in @entity56 , he knows his track record and believes he had the capability to be one of the masterminds			1
the former agent also insisted he might have been given an insight into the plans had he still been working for @entity16 intelligence , but his relationship with @entity87 and the @entity1 ended in mid- 2012 after a disagreement following a mission in @entity38			2
first appearance : four suspects ( left to right ) @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 stood in the dock today for a hearing at a courtroom in @entity56 accused of playing a part in the @entity78 bombing capable : storm was not aware of the direct role @entity124 played in the @entity78 massacre , but believes he had the potential to mastermind such an attack inner workings : @entity46 reporter @entity167 's interview with @entity42 provides a rare insight into how an intelligence agency , like the @entity1 , builds relationships with terrorists he said : ' i get really frustrated to know that @entity124 had been maybe involved in the @entity78 terrorist attack			1
it frustrates me a lot because it could have been stopped and i 'm sad i ca n't be involved in this			0
' ' he was one of the smartest ones i met in east @entity178			0
' one of @entity120 's former associates also told @entity46 in @entity56 that he was the ' main link ' between @entity50 and the @entity31 - based militant group @entity182			1
now @entity16 counter-terorrism officials fear his reputation in @entity187 circles worldwide will be bolstered by his escape during the @entity190 operation in @entity50 last week , and he is now in a position to plan more deadly attacks in @entity92 and @entity178			2
@entity46 reporter @entity167 , who interviewed @entity7 , told @entity193 : ' he is frustrated because he gave equipment and material to @entity120 which allowed him to build up his credibility in @entity11			1
' when he first met him 2008 , @entity124 was just a messenger in a group and now he is head of the organisation			1
' storm 's viewing is that had the @entity1 paid closer attention to @entity203 and had the plans that were being put in place for storm to keep closer tabs on him followed through , then there would be more information on their operations and potential targets			2
' it would have allowed @entity42 to develop closer contacts with @entity21 , and would have enabled him to find out what they were thinking and what they were planning			0
' his accounts of where he was and what he was doing has all checked out			0
encrypted emails he has sent and received show he was in central position in the relationship			0
helpless : @entity223 soldiers take their position at the @entity78 shopping centre			0
storm says he is frustrated knowing he could have prevented the attack storm started his jihadist career in @entity38 and , after he made contacts contacted the @entity1 , as well as @entity8 security agency and @entity86			2
mr @entity167 added : ' storm provides a rare opportunity to see inside agencies			2
it provides a rare insight into the way that they work			0
' to get closer into an organisation you need to build relationships			0
it can be a double - edged sword and in this case it was			0
' it put a smart guy in a position of power for a very negative effect			0
tragedy : a man whose relative was killed during the massacre is carried out by hospital staff ' @entity42 believes the attacks could have been thwarted			0
he is not involved in this anymore so he does n't know if @entity124 actually had a direct role			2
' but he knows @entity21 's track record			0
storm was seen as an important connection who could move between their worlds in @entity38 and @entity50 and the rest of the world			2
' @entity124 is believed to be able to speak five languages - @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity50 , and @entity269 - which puts him in a position of authority in @entity11			1
now said to be in his late twenties he was born into a middle class @entity50 family in @entity275 , @entity31			2
his family then moved to @entity56 where the young @entity124 excelled at school in the languages , including @entity279			1
after a successful education , he traveled to @entity266 in 2004 , because of the potential economic opportunities in @entity92 , and took advantage of his @entity50 ethnicity which allowed him to apply for refugee status			0
despite being given documents to stay in the country , he did not fit in and started to become radicalised			0
just four years later , he left @entity92 and returned to @entity178			0
it is also believed @entity124 spent some time in @entity288 and lived in @entity289 for between six and 12 months			1
the @entity1 would not comment on the story and @entity87 said they could neither confirm or deny they knew @entity7 .			1

@entity7 was an informant for intelligence agencies for five years
met @entity20 , or @entity295 , in @entity56 in 2008
at the time , the @entity50 terrorist was only a messenger in @entity11
storm believes @entity1 gave him the resources to become a mastermind
@entity124 is also believed to have lived in @entity289 for six to 12 months
