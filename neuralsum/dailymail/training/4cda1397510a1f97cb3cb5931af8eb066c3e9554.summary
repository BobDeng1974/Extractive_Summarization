by @entity0 next time you fly , here ’s the perfect excuse to switch off your work laptop , put down the crossword and settle in with a drink and an in - flight movie			0
travelling by plane can make it more difficult to think , according to @entity12 ’s foremost aviation doctor			1
professor @entity13 advises fliers to sit back and relax rather than keeping busy by doing puzzles or catching up on important work			1
not at our best : @entity12 's top aviation doctor says it is best to relax rather than trying to work while flying this is because the air pressure on board planes is lower than it is at sea level , making it harder for the brain to make use of oxygen in the air , so diminishing its performance			1
typically , when a plane is cruising at 40,000ft , the air pressure in the cabin will be equivalent to that found outside at 6,000 to 8,000ft			2
there is no evidence that wearing compression stockings prevents the development of @entity38 , says a leading expert professor @entity13 , of @entity41 , explained : ‘ learning is a bit impaired at 8,000ft so performance of recently learned tasks is a bit impaired at 8,000ft			1
you do n’t want to make the biggest decision of your life			0
’ however , if you are well - practised in a task , it is unlikely your performance will be affected			0
professor @entity13 , the @entity55 ’s first full - time professor of aviation medicine , said : ‘ if you regularly do a crossword , you are going to be fine			1
but if it is something that is new to you , you are probably not going to do it as well			0
’ this explains why commercial pilots ’ thinking is not impaired			2
they get used to carrying out tasks in a simulator at ground level before they might have to carry them out during a flight			0
professor @entity13 also said his advice could become even more pertinent if internet access becomes widespread on planes , meaning businessmen and women are more likely to use flying time to work			1
‘ those looking forward to having emails in flight might want to think twice about sending that email to the bank manager , ’ he said			0
the former @entity81 medic also insisted that most people ’s fears of deep vein thrombosis are groundless			1
the condition , dubbed ‘ economy class syndrome ’ , has caused anxiety among holidaymakers , business people and frequent fliers			2
but professor @entity13 said it is extremely rare , other than in those who have late - stage cancer or another medical condition that predisposes them to blood clots			1
the evidence that compression stockings will help prevent @entity38 in healthy people is inconclusive			2
passengers should , however , stay hydrated and exercise their legs			0
he said : ‘ no matter how small your seat , you can always flex your seat , raise and lower your feet and exercise your calves			0
millions of people do it every year , without any issues at all			0

professor @entity13 says travellers should relax rather than working
@entity12 's top aviation doctors says learning is ' impaired ' at 8,000ft
also says most people 's fears of deep vein thrombosis are groundless
