@entity2 should avoid drinking alcohol on consecutive days , the government ’s health quango is to advise			1
in a startling shift in official guidance , the public are to be told that they should abstain for a day after drinking			1
@entity9 says the ‘ one day on , one day off ’ rule is needed because daily drinking is a key contributor to increased health risks			1
@entity23 mp @entity22 last night called it ‘ completely unrealistic ’ , adding : ‘ people have the common sense to know how to look after themselves			0
’ the plan is contained in an official document from the quango and is mentioned among ‘ new strategies to help people remain within the guidelines ’			2
it states that a ‘ simple approach ’ such as never drinking two days in a row would have a positive impact on health			2
regular drinking ‘ over the lower - risk guideline ’ – meaning anything more than one large glass of wine for a woman or one to two pints of lager for a man – can ‘ become a problem ’ , it adds			1
as a result , health chiefs propose to ‘ explore the effectiveness and impact of encouraging people to have some drink - free time every week ’			1
yesterday critics said the new guidelines would simply worry those who drink moderate amounts – and would do little to tackle those who binge - drink or have an alcohol problem			1
@entity23 mp @entity22 ( pictured ) has called the proposed guidance ' completely unrealistic ' @entity60 dr @entity59 said : ‘ giving up alcohol on alternate days is not something most doctors would recognise as a helpful strategy to curb excessive drinking			0
’ drinking regularly in moderation was ‘ better and safer for health than abstinence ’ , he said , claiming the ‘ middle - aged , middle - class drinker ’ should not be ‘ made to feel guilty over having a restorative glass of wine every day ’			1
others criticised the government for issuing yet another set of ‘ nannying ’ guidelines about alcohol			2
@entity80 of the @entity81 think - tank said : ‘ people do n’t pay attention to guidelines – and it ’s hardly surprising when they change so much			1
the government would be much better off simply to say “ everything in moderation ”			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity9 should be closed down			2
we are supposed to be living in times of austerity and the government is spending tens of millions of pounds on a nanny - state quango			0
’ @entity23 mp @entity94 added : ‘ we live in a free society and it ’s up to people to decide if to drink , when and how often , provided they behave in a lawful way			0
@entity9 should stick to matters of serious concern in terms of public health , not start straying into telling people how to live their lives			1
’ the suggested new guidelines are contained in a marketing strategy drawn up by @entity9			1
it suggests initially starting the campaign for ‘ drink free days ’ on a regional basis			0
if successful , much stronger guidance could then be made official across the country			0
defending the idea , officials said early research indicates it could prove easier for people to stick to than advice which says they should simply reduce the amount they drink every time they go out			2
present guidance from the chief medical officer is for people to ideally refrain from drinking on two or three days a week			2
women are told not to drink more than three units a day , while men are allowed four			2
a large glass of wine is typically three units , while a pint of lager is just over two			0
last night @entity9 said further action was required because of the rising toll of health problems linked to drinking – estimated to cost the country £ 21billion			1
officials said early research indicates it could prove easier for people to stick to than advice which says they should simply reduce the amount they drink every time they go out some 15,479 people died from alcohol - related causes in 2010 – up 30 per cent since 2001			2
a quarter of all deaths among men aged 16 to 24 are also attributable to alcohol			0
a @entity9 spokesman said it was still ‘ exploring the evidence ’ , but stood by the guidelines			1
‘ this helps to break the habit of drinking regularly and early findings from consumer research indicates that people may find it easier to reduce drinking occasions as opposed to drinking the volume consumed on each occasion			2
’ @entity161 , of @entity162 , said : ‘ sometimes it ’s hard to make sure you have two or more days off from drinking but it is important to have a regular break			0
’ giving up alcohol on alternate days is not something most doctors would recognise as a helpful strategy to curb excessive drinking			0
firstly , i do n’t know of any prospective studies trying out this approach			0
this is where researchers recruit volunteers to try to discover from the outset what effect it has on an individual ’s health and on their attitudes towards alcohol			0
and i doubt very much whether there are any epidemiological studies that have investigated it , which would mean looking at statistics on groups of people to discover if alternate - day drinking results in different outcomes for different groups			1
in other words , where is the evidence ? what we do know is that drinking regularly in moderation , probably a drink a day , about one or two units , is better and safer for health than abstinence mainly due to its benefits for heart health			1
this particularly applies to men over 40 and post-menopausal women , who are at higher risk of heart disease – although it ’s clear from the evidence that drinking a lot more is positively dangerous			1
but the binge - drinking that plagues our society is seldom the province of those worried about how their hearts are holding up , let alone their livers and all the other organs susceptible to the damage caused by large amounts of ethanol			0
it ’s hard to see how this plan from @entity9 – which is presumably concerned about public health in its widest sense – will persuade excessive drinkers to rein back			1
a thoughtful strategy aimed at tackling the anti-social mayhem caused on our high streets each weekend by mainly young binge drinkers – who have pre-loaded before they even venture out – would be a eureka moment			0
instead it seems the target is the middle - aged , middle - class drinker , who will be made to feel guilty over having a restorative glass of wine every day			0
would n’t it be more user - friendly to encourage the techniques that people actually employ to keep their consumption down , by showing restraint that works for them ? for example , the two days off each week that i know many patients have adopted to cut their drinking by two - sevenths – providing they do n’t drink more on the other days to make up			1
or having a dry january that shows the bottle who ’s boss			0
drinking in moderation is for many people part of a balanced lifestyle that can at the very least , according to @entity266 , help us live with the ‘ crabbedness of old age ’			0
it ’s questionable whether this notion of alternate day drinking will do much beyond making the vast majority of these drinkers just a little more grumpy on a saturday morning			1

people are to be told that they should abstain from day after day drinking
@entity9 says daily drinking contributed to health problems
experts questioned whether evidence showed it would decrease health risks
proposal has been branded ' nannying guidelines ' by critics against idea
report said regular drinking over lower - risk guideline can become a problem
