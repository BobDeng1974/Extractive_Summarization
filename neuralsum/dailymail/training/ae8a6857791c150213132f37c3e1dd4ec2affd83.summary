it may only be october but on @entity2 's @entity1 is in full swing and nowhere quite does it like @entity5			1
the world famous department store unveiled its legendary @entity9 windows this morning showcasing over a year 's worth of hard work , creativity and festive thinking			1
and for 2014 for the first time ever , @entity5 gave a lucky few members of the press an exclusive glimpse into the making of @entity1 's most spectacular windows			1
@entity20 headed down last night to discover the method behind the magic			1
a work of art : a @entity26 themed window sees a mannequin dressed in a custom made @entity31 cape and 10,000 laser cut leaves for the past eight days the department store has been looking rather naked as the the in - house team completed final preparations on the much anticipated displays with the store front hidden behind vinyl stickers			1
last night saw the vinyl come down and the lights come up to a small but excited audience			2
the theme for this year 's @entity9 displays evolved from the notion of storytelling			1
the idea is spread right across the store with book motifs appearing on escalators , counters and hanging from the ceiling			0
the window displays themselves take inspiration from traditional fairy tales but , with @entity5 famed for their contemporary touch , each story depicted a modern twist			1
web of dreams : the golden web hosts dozens of metallic products produced exclusively for the store modern fairy tale : this contemporary take on @entity65 sees mannequins dressed in @entity68 print dresses not so ugly duckling : the central model wears a feather style dress from @entity72 right from the first unveiling of the 23 windows it was clear that these were not your average bedtime stories			0
a neon pink mannequin dressed in a custom made @entity31 cape stands before you surrounded by woodland animals adorned with an exclusive selection of @entity85 jewellery			0
at first glance @entity26 may not spring to mind but whether you recognise it or not the story has you captivated			2
the mannequin stands in front of a hand sculpted tree decorated with laser cut leaves in pinks and golds , the creative team later revealed that there were over 10,000 of the intricate leaves created for the windows			0
other festive themed fables included the store 's take on @entity105			2
the centre mannequin who is sat within a rainbow nest and wears a bespoke feather dress from the @entity110 , seemed anything other than ugly			0
@entity112 touches : even after they have unveiled their window displays there are often some final adjustments to be made never ending story : the 23 windows take the team up to 18 months to develop from an idea to display @entity121 : the enormous neon sign is one of the largest to have been featured on the store 's canopy another highlight that will surely have any festive fashionista swooning was the store 's take on @entity130			1
rather than one simple pair of glass slippers , @entity131 is surrounded by a plethora of glitzy and metallic heels that will no doubt be the staple footwear of the @entity9 season			1
taking centre stage was a very special pair of exclusive @entity141 winged heels that are estimated to retail for Â£ 800			0
in the story of of @entity144 , the princess appears to have woven herself an impressive spider 's web with the intricate sparkly golden weave acting as a backdrop for the window			1
within the web dozens of golden products dangle from the threads , all exclusive to the store , giving a nod to @entity5 ' recent installation of a shop of entirely gold products			1
one member of the design team was quick to add that the golden spider web had been a labour of love			0
' the woman who crafted the web told me that it had taken her so long that she had got through ten audio books during its making ! ' he said			2
look familiar ? the @entity170 has certain traits that are inspired by @entity172 himself , including the top hat bedtime stories : this window takes inspiration from @entity178 who currently has a concept store within @entity5 @entity182 holiday : the store takes inspiration from @entity185 when it comes to the spruce that surrounds the window it was n't just the spider 's web that had been a long time coming			1
october may seem early enough to start @entity9 but for @entity5 themselves seasonal plans start even earlier			1
this year 's scheme had been in development since november 2013 when the theme was decided on by the creative team			1
@entity197 , the store 's creative director says that thinking so far ahead is always a risk but it is important to just go with it			2
' we take inspiration from all over the place			2
it can be from festivals or fashion shows and we just begin collecting ideas together before deciding on a final theme			1
' you do have to take a risk when anticipating trends so far ahead and it does require a lot of foresight			0
' despite having to produce the theme so far ahead , @entity197 says that they rarely change anything once they have started planning			2
' we do have to tweak a few minor things if suddenly discover that something is n't going to work in the window but on the whole we do n't tend to change very much once the design is decided on			2
you just have to go with it			0
' @entity197 says that for the @entity9 windows they wanted it to be festive but , as always , there had to be a twist			1
cyber story : @entity233 appears out of this world as she dozes inside a perspex neon crystal @entity238 is coming to town : @entity5 purchased a real mini and then sliced it in half for this montage ' this year is slightly more traditional than some of our previous displays ' says @entity197 ' but at the same time it has this hyper - realistic feel it is very other - worldly and all of the colours make it almost like a kaleidoscope			1
' @entity252 , the @entity253 at the store says that @entity9 gives them a lot more potential to be more extravagant when it comes to windows			2
' because our windows are south facing it means that @entity9 is the only time that we can really play with light ' says @entity252 adding ' lights are just completely wasted in the summer so we have to just rule them out , so it is really fun to be able to play with them at @entity9			2
' the scale of which @entity5 does @entity9 is just phenomenal			1
this year alone there are 197,000 baubles , 1,005 @entity9 trees and not forgetting the 75 metres of fake hair to create @entity65 's tresses ! the largest installation by far is the decoration for the canopy that over hangs the main entrance to the beauty hall			1
said to be one of the store 's largest canopy displays it will see 18 - 20 metres of fairy lights and over a kilometre of neon lighting			2
candy land : a sugar coated window houses the store 's selection of children 's @entity9 presents @entity291 , senior brand pr manager for @entity5 , added that the canopy will have one very special guest added this year			1
' the main feature will be the @entity170			0
he will be wearing a top hat and a monocle which is a sort of tongue in cheek reminisce towards @entity300			0
' @entity291 added that the heavy sprucing that the store use on the windows and canopy is unlike any that yous see in the @entity306			0
' no one does sprucing to this scale ' says @entity291			0
' you see it everywhere in @entity185 but i have never seen it so thick in any other department store in @entity306			0
' in terms of competition @entity5 are way ahead of their competitors @entity317 , @entity315 's and @entity316 who are n't due to unveil their windows until early november			1
grand finale : a member of the production team adds a final lick of paint to the @entity170 on the store 's canopy ' it 's not intentional ' adds @entity291 ' we pick a date to unveil every year and we just always end up being the first ones			1
this is an understanding that all of the stores have			0
' if you think the unveiling all went without a hitch you would be mistaken			0
within minutes of removing the vinyl the creative team were rushing to adjust minor details in the window to ensure perfection			0
@entity252 says that whether there are faults in the window or not they try and adjust them over the festive period to keep their passers by interested			0
' our audience is so vast			0
yes , we have people who come actively to see the windows but then we have the people who walk past everyday or stand at the bus stop and we want to keep them interested			0
' despite the endless effort that goes into the windows not only in the run up but right over the festive season @entity252 seems pleased with her work			0
' the windows are always a risk ' she says ' but if you really believe in something and it 's a good idea , it is always worth it			0
' overall overall store decoration * @entity369 figures are across @entity2 , @entity370 and @entity372 stores @entity2 windows @entity374 lights @entity374 street canopy installation			0
