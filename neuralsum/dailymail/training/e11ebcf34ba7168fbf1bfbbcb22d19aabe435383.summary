by @entity0 @entity1 has successfully completed the second soft - landing in the ocean of its reusable rocket system with a view to landing it on solid ground - possibly by the end of the year			1
the rocket was the first stage of a @entity10 that launched on 14 july , which took six @entity13 satellites into orbit			2
an on - board camera captured the descent , and the data gathered during the trip by @entity1 will improve the landing on upcoming flights			1
the test is an important stepping stone to landing rockets on the ground			1
on this occasion the @entity10 rocket had a ' soft ' landing in the @entity33 the first stage of the rocket , which is the bottom part of it , separated about two minutes and 43 seconds after the launch on 14 july			1
@entity10 topped with @entity1 fairing is 224.4 feet ( 68.4 meters ) tall and 12 feet in diameter ( the fairing is 17 feet in diameter )			1
its nine first - stage @entity43 engines generate 1.3 million pounds of thrust at sea level , rising to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as @entity10 climbs out of the @entity49 ’s atmosphere			2
falcon 9 is named after the @entity52 starship in the @entity54 movies			0
the number 9 refers to the nine @entity43 engines that power falcon 9 ’s first stage ; one @entity43 vacuum engine powers the second stage			0
at this point the rocket was more than 31 miles ( 50km ) high			0
just under six minutes later it then began to start the process of re-entry			0
this started with what is known as a boost back burn , which took it on a parabola towards its target landing in the ocean			0
it then ignited its engines again , having shut them off , to reduce its speed as it passed through the atmosphere			0
this limits the amount of heat the rocket experiences on re-entry			0
once through the atmosphere , the rocket again underwent an unpowered descent before it ignited the engines once more above the ocean			0
here the landing legs deployed , which will one day be used to set the rocket down on the ground , and it touched down in the ocean			2
as planned , the rocket then fell over horizontally , and the impact with the water destroyed the hull			0
the video itself is not very clear because ice covered the camera as the rocket passed down through the atmosphere			0
however @entity1 has acknolwedged this and said they are taking measures to limit the build up of ice and spots on the camera so that future videos are of better quality			2
later this year @entity1 plans to attempt to land one of its @entity10 rockets on a floating barge			1
the ultimate goal is to build reusable rockets that can return from space			1
pictured is the @entity117 test rocket , which @entity1 has been using to perform ' hops ' up to low altitudes and practice landing on solid ground ‘ this test confirms that the @entity10 booster is able consistently to re-enter from space at hypersonic velocity , restart main engines twice , deploy landing legs and touch down at near zero velocity , ’ @entity1 said in a news release			1
its ultimate goal , as mentioned earlier , is to make the rockets reusable and have them touch down on land			1
and from their news release , it seems like their first attempt at doing this will be on a floating barge			1
@entity141 ’s @entity140 holds a patent for landing rockets on barges , though , so it is not known if he will challenge @entity146 over this			1
‘ at this point , we are highly confident of being able to land successfully on a floating launch pad or back at the launch site and refly the rocket with no required refurbishment , ’ the company says			2
this launch vehicle was a @entity10 rocket , carrying a payload of @entity13 communications satellites , which lifted off from launch complex 40 at the @entity159 in @entity159 , @entity160 on monday 14 july ( pictured ) @entity1 ceo @entity146 has grand plans for his space agency			1
with help from @entity164 he has grown the company significantly in a decade			0
it is now capable of taking cargo to the @entity169 with its @entity170 and @entity10 rocket and , beginning possibly in the next few years , the company will take humans into space they also reveal how the next water landing will be on flight 13 of the @entity10 series of rocket , which will take place in september this year and will carry the fourth scheduled @entity170 cargo mission to the @entity169 ( sixth flight of the @entity181 )			1
this will have a ‘ low probability of success ’ because the rocket will be without its stabilising landing struts , according to @entity185			0
the first attempt to touch down on a barge will be on flight 14 , which could be as early as october			0
this would be the first rocket ever successfully retrieved from space without landing in water			2
on these initial flights , @entity1 is being very cautious with the rocket ’s re-entry through the atmosphere			2
they are using a lot of fuel to bring the speed down as much as possible to prevent significant damage being done to the rocket			0
in future , however , it ’s likely they will push the limits of re-entry forces so they are able to waste less fuel bringing the rocket back to @entity49			0
the development of this capability is an important step in making rockets reusable			2
@entity1 ’s ultimate goal is to have rockets launch to orbit then return to @entity49 intact .			1

@entity22 - based @entity1 has completed a second rocket touchdown
the test is an important stepping stone to landing rockets on the ground
on this occasion , the @entity10 rocket had a ' soft ' landing in the @entity33
and later this year @entity1 plans to attempt a landing on a floating barge
the ultimate goal is to build reusable rockets that can return from space
