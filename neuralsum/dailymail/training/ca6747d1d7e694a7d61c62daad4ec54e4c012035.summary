people with the rare @entity3 blood group are more likely to develop memory loss , a study has found			1
@entity6 researchers found that people with the rare bloody type were 82 per cent more likely to develop thinking and memory problems that can lead to dementia , than people with other blood types			1
the new study comes on the back of past research which suggests people with blood type o have a lower risk of heart disease and stroke , thus decreasing the risk of memory loss and dementia			1
researchers analysed a group of people , aged 45 and above , for an average of more than three years			0
@entity6 researchers found that people with rare blood group @entity3 were 82 per cent more likely to develop the thinking and memory problems that can lead to dementia , than people with other blood types they identified 495 participants who developed thinking and memory problems or cognitive impairment , during the study			1
they were compared with 687 people with no cognitive problems			0
people with @entity3 blood type made up six per cent of those who developed cognitive impairment - higher than the four per cent of the general population with the blood group			1
author dr @entity40 , of the @entity41 , said the new study supports the idea that having a certain blood group may give a lower risk for heart disease and stroke , which in turn protects the brain			2
she said : ' our study looks at blood type and risk of cognitive impairment , but several studies have shown that factors such as high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia			2
' blood type is also related to other vascular conditions like stroke , so the findings highlight the connections between vascular issues and brain health			0
' researchers said the study supports previous research which suggests having a certain blood group , like @entity74 , gives a lower risk for heart disease and stroke , which in turn protects the brain she added : ' more research is needed to confirm these results			1
' researchers also looked at blood levels of factor viii , a protein that helps blood to clot			0
high levels of factor viii are related to higher risk of cognitive impairment and dementia			0
people in this study with higher levels of factor @entity95 in their blood were 24 per cent more likely to develop thinking and memory problems than people with lower levels of the protein			2
people with ab blood had a higher average level of factor viii than people with other blood types .			0

study found that people with rare blood type @entity3 were 82 ***%*** more likely to develop memory loss than people with other blood types
thinking and memory problems can be early *signals* of dementia , although the study did not look at dementia itself
of the people that developed memory problems , 6 ***%*** had blood type @entity3 - higher than the 4 ***%*** of people in the population with this blood type
previous studies show people with blood group o have a lower risk of heart disease and stroke
