by @entity0 scientists at the @entity2 found no link between temperature , rain , air pressure and humidity and back pain your granny will swear blind that the old tale is true - but it appears a cold night does not make a sore back worse , after all			1
scientists , in fact , could find no link between back pain and any kind of weather			1
they tracked the levels of pain in nearly 1,000 back patients - and compared the results with temperature , air pressure , humidity , wind direction and rain			1
the only slight hint of heightened pain was on gusty , windy days , but even then the difference was so low that the scientists ruled it out as scientifically insignificant			2
one in three of us experience back pain at some point in our lives			1
it is the most common musculoskeletal condition globally , according to the @entity36			0
the @entity38 research , published in the journal @entity40 and @entity41 , compared the weather when patients first noticed their back pain with conditions one week and one month before the onset of the pain			1
dr @entity48 , of the @entity2 , @entity38 , said : ‘ many patients believe that weather impacts their pain symptoms			1
‘ however , there are few robust studies investigating weather and pain , specifically research that does not rely on patient recall of the weather			2
‘ our findings refute previously held beliefs that certain common weather conditions increase risk of lower back pain			1
’ the academic admitted , however , that the temperate climate in @entity67 - where all the patients lived - may partially explain the results			0
‘ regions with more extreme weather conditions may present a different result but further research is needed , ’ he said			0
the popular belief about weather and its association with back pain seems to be stronger than the data would support			2
and he said that other musculoskeletal conditions may be affected by weather			0
the study examined 1,000 patients suffering back pain			1
dr @entity48 , of the @entity2 , @entity38 , said : ' many patients believe that weather impacts their pain symptoms			1
however , there are few robust studies investigating weather and pain , specifically research that does not rely on patient recall of the weather ' ‘ further investigation of the influence of weather parameters on symptoms associated with specific diseases such as fibromyalgia , rheumatoid arthritis , and osteoarthritis are needed , ’ dr @entity48 said			0
@entity104 , a 47 - year - old @entity38 who has suffered from a bad back since a teenage surfing injury , refused to accept the results			0
she claims her pain is so affected by weather that her friends call her the ‘ human barometer ’			0
‘ i got smashed by a wave and my back has been a problem ever since , ’ she said			0
‘ maybe the weather does n’t affect everyone			0
but there must be a lot of people who are in the same boat as me , who do find that cold weather and a change of weather really affects their back			2
’ other old wives ' tales we fall for			0

study at the @entity2 examined 1,000 back patients
found no link between temperature , rain , air pressure and humidity and pain
old wives tale says a cold night will make a sore back worse
