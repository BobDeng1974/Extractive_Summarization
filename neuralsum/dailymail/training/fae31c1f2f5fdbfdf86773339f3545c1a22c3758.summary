by @entity1 reporter published : 15:46 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 8 september 2013 suffering from dementia , 76 - year - old @entity2 was kicked out of the home after forgetting to pay a $ 134 property tax bill that grew to a nearly $ 5,000 debt through a predatory tax system			1
the foreclosure happened after @entity2 's tax debt was sold by the government at auction as a tax lien to a private purchaser in @entity14			1
the owners of his lien then charged him interest , adding expensive legal fees into the mix - eventually bringing the total owed to $ 4,999			2
' i have nothing ' : 76 - year - old @entity2 walking by the house he used to own in @entity26 before the owner of his $ 134 tax lien foreclosed it and kicked him out his home was one of 200 foreclosed in recent years by tax lien owners who often come from out of state to buy the debts at auction - a system the @entity37 has been investigating for the past 10 months			1
@entity2 's original debt started in 2006 when he forgot to pay a $ 134 property tax bill			1
when he did n't pay that bill , the city put a lien on the debt and added on $ 183 in interest and penalties			2
@entity2 's son paid $ 317 to erase the debt in 2009 - but by then it was too late			1
a @entity14 company had bought the lien and raised the debt to $ 4,999			1
his son wrote the court , saying he could n't pay that much			0
' i would hate for him at this age to lose his home , ' he wrote			0
so he made another payment of $ 700 , but then stopped			0
with no further payments , the court approved a foreclosure in june 2010			0
the following summer , federal marshals appeared at @entity2 's door to forcibly remove him from his home			2
unaffordable : once the government sold his debt to a private purchaser , they charged him interest and added on exorbitant legal feeds which brought the new debt to nearly $ 5,000 unfortunate : the @entity37 investigation also found other cases where the elderly or terminally ill were being foreclosed on for debts less than $ 1,000 he watched from across the street as his entire life 's possessions were kicked to the curb			1
movers were hired to liquidate the home of is easy chair , clothes , his television - even his @entity84 medals and pictures of his wife @entity87 who died of breast cancer in 1988			0
with no where to go , @entity2 slept in a chair on his front porch that first night			0
now , he lives in a group home a mile away from his former home			2
forced to leave his home and part with all his possessions , @entity2 told @entity37 reporters : ' i have nothing '			2
after the foreclosure @entity2 was given a court ordered conservator who has been helping him fight for his home , which was sold for $ 71,000 two months after his eviction			0
' he had no chance ' attorney @entity106 said			0
he did not understand the ramifications of what was going to happen to him			0
' the @entity37 investigated the district 's tax lien program for 10 months and found that the lien program in the district got out of control when lien owners were allowed to start charging legal fees			1
these fees quickly escalated small debts like @entity2 's into something unmanageable			2
all over $ 134 : now mr @entity2 lives in a group home about a mile from his old home in fact , the @entity37 found that of the 200 homes foreclosed in recent years , one in three of the liens were debts less than $ 1,000			1
while other cities and states have instituted rules on liens , such as capping fees and protecting homes of the elderly - the safeguards in @entity26 were n't as rigid which is why they attracted buyers from out of state			0
some of these purchasers have been accused of rigging tax auctions to win certain liens in other states			0
in addition to @entity2 , the @entity37 discovered several other cases of the elderly or sick losing their homes over a petty debt			1
a 65 - year - old flower shop owner was dying of cancer in hospice , when a lien company in @entity152 foreclosed his home of 40 years after he failed to pay $ 1,025 in back taxes			1
another case involved a 95 - year - old church choir leader who was kicked out of her house over an original tax debt of $ 44.79 while she was in a nursing home for @entity160 's .			0

@entity2 , 76 , lost his home two years *ago* after forgetting to pay a $ 134 property tax bill
that debt grew to $ 4,999 when his debt was sold by the government to a private purchaser in @entity14
now he lives in a group home a mile from his home after losing his home an all his possessions
@entity2 's home is just one of 200 homes foreclosed in recent years in @entity26 because of tax lien debts
this system of *selling* liens to private purchasers was *profiled* in a recent @entity37 report
