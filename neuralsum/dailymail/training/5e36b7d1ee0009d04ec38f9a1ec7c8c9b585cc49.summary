by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 04:46 est , 1 august 2012 tragic : lance corporal @entity1 , of the @entity2 , was killed in october 2009 but it could have been prevented a soldier who was about to be married was killed by an improvised explosive device in @entity7 after the army failed to properly sweep a training area for insurgent bombs , an inquest heard today			1
lance corporal @entity1 , of the @entity2 @entity12 , died on an ' unsecured ' firing range 2.5 miles outside @entity15 in central @entity16 on october 8 2009			1
@entity18 coroner @entity17 said today the army ignored safety warnings and instead of carrying out a full four - hour search for mines , only 45 minutes was spent sweeping the area for deadly ieds			1
up to 300 service personnel would be trained on the firing range each day , particularly in peak periods such as april and october when a new influx of troops from the @entity30 would arrive , he said			1
but the firing range was also ' swamped ' by local residents after each session who scavenged for spent ammunition cases to sell as scrap metal , also making it easy to plant an explosive			1
within nine days of @entity39 's death , the army had created a new firing range within the secure fence of @entity15			1
recording a verdict that @entity39 was unlawfully killed whilst on active service in @entity7 , mr @entity17 passed on his condolences to the soldier 's family who were present for the hearing and said the army could have done more he added that the area of the range where the soldiers waited between exercises and where @entity39 was killed , was not clearly marked to show where it had been cleared with a @entity56 bomb locator used by @entity30 forces			1
' i find that the metal content of the ied which killed @entity39 would have been such that the @entity56 operator would have been blind and deaf not to have registered it , ' mr @entity17 said			2
' the register would have gone off the scale and there would have been a loud double tone that the handler would definitely have heard			0
changes : after @entity1 's death the army moved their training area inside the secure @entity15 camp , pictured , in central @entity16 ' concerns relating to the range team 's ability to clear the range to the safest possible level in the circumstances prevailing at the time were brought to the attention of the chain of command at @entity15 by the range conducting officer			1
' it is not clear what action , if any , was taken by the chain of command as a result of those concerns			0
' immediately after @entity1 's death substantial changes were made to the firing ranges and the manner in which they were protected and in which the training was done			1
' it was within the scope of the powers of the military authorities to have taken those measures prior to @entity101 ' death			2
' speaking outside the inquest , @entity39 's parents , of @entity104 , @entity18 , said the @entity105 had failed in its duty of care for their son			2
in a statement released jointly with their son 's fiancee @entity111 , they said : ' @entity1 ' death totally shattered our lives and now we have been deeply hurt all over again as we have discovered that his death was needless and entirely preventable			1
safety fears : up to 300 soldiers in @entity7 were trained on the shooting range every day but it was not properly secured ' it was not just those responsible for planting the ied that caused his death , but a culture of complacency and a disregard for every soldier 's safety that reached right up the chain of command			2
' those in charge of his safety owed him a duty of care , a duty , we feel , they totally and utterly failed			0
' a proper system of communicating up and down the chain of command could possibly have prevented this tragedy			0
' in addition , we have heard how the issues of resources and training , the assessment of risk and the perception of threat had a large impact on the overall situation that led to @entity1 ' death			1
' we can only hope that the enormity of what has happened is recognised and this is never allowed to happen again			0
' @entity1 ' life was irreplaceable and he meant the world to us			1
' we would like to take this opportunity to put on record our gratitude to all the people who have helped us in so many ways through this most difficult of times			0
' when asked if he had faith in the @entity166 to address the issues raised by the inquest , mr @entity1 said : ' not totally , we can only hope , that is what this is all about , trying to prevent something like this happening again			2
' his wife added : ' we just hope to stop anything like this happening again to other families			0
' mrs @entity176 added : ' we just had @entity7 to get through			0
' he was our only child and @entity111 and @entity1 were so happy together			2
' we were just looking forward to it			0
' miss @entity111 explained how she and @entity39 had been planning for the wedding which would have taken place following his return from @entity7 , which was his second tour of duty there			0
she said : ' the wedding was planned , the dress was bought			0
' @entity1 is and always will be the love of my life and i feel so grateful to have had the time i had with him			1
' he will live on forever in my heart and memories until we are together again			0
' lieutenant colonel @entity192 , the current commanding officer of @entity193 , said : ' @entity39 was a first rate @entity195 who loved nothing more than soldiering with his colleagues			0
' he is enormously missed across the 1st @entity193 and our prayers and condolences are with his family and friends			0
' an @entity166 spokesman said : ' our thoughts remain with the family of lance corporal @entity1			1
' searches of the training range were carried out using @entity209 detectors and no @entity6 were found			1
' however , an investigation into the incident showed that more thorough procedures to reduce the risk of ieds being planted should have been carried out			0
' as a result of this tragic incident , immediate steps were taken to prevent any further risk from ieds on the range , including additional force protection			0
' since 2010 , ranges have been located within the expanded perimeter of @entity15 and stringent checks are conducted regularly to ensure that the ranges are being used as safely as possible			2

nine days after his death the training *zone* was shut and moved inside *nearby* ' secure ' @entity15
' @entity1 ' life was irreplaceable and he meant the world to us , ' his family said after the verdict of unlawful killing today
