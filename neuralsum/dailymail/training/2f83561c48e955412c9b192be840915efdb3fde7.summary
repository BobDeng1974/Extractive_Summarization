a @entity1 magazine landed themselves in the middle of a racial controversy over a photoshopped picture of first lady @entity5 on the cover of their latest issue			2
the picture places mrs @entity5 's face in a 1800 portrait of a slave with an exposed breast , and @entity14 likely knew the image was going to stir up controversy			1
the editors may have had a different message in mind given the historical context of the particular painting , but that sentiment was overlooked by online viewers who found the composite offensive and racist			0
controversial : a @entity1 magazine digitally altered a @entity27 portrait of a slave to include the @entity5 's face the portrait in question was initially released 1800 , when @entity27 artist @entity32 exhibited the painting , titled @entity34 , at the @entity36 's annual salon			1
it was viewed as a inspiring image because the country had abolished slavery six years prior , and the portrait was thought of as an uplifting symbol of both women 's and black people 's rights			2
in keeping with the true meaning , the accompanying article translates to ' @entity48 of a slave , @entity50 '			0
both mrs @entity5 's great - great grandfather and great - great - great grandmother were slaves			1
from the preview of the article appears to be glowing - touting the axiom that ' behind every great man is a great woman ' - but the full piece has yet to be released online			0
that seems not to matter to bloggers who feel the divisiveness of the image skews meaning , whatever it may be			0
out of context : the article reportedly praises mrs @entity5 's popularity in the run up to the @entity70 election the fact that one of the slave woman 's breasts is exposed in the portrait does not help to tone down the composite when it is attached to @entity5 's face			1
' as a @entity79 speaker i first looked at the image and just thought @entity82 that 's @entity5 's boobs , ' writes @entity84 on @entity85			1
according to @entity86 , the image is just one in a series of edited photos that show famous people 's faces on the heads of other nudes			0
mrs @entity5 will reportedly be joined by her husband @entity94 , former president @entity95 and princess @entity96 whose images are inside the magazine			2
artist @entity99 defends the artistic choice , saying that it shows an ' alternative unexpected reality ' by allowing the viewer to see ' famous individuals in a different way ' .			0

magazine digitally altered @entity27 portrait of a slave woman from 1800 so that the @entity5 's face appears on the nude subject 's body
