@entity0 has revealed how @entity2 pal @entity1 savagely beat up a @entity4 team - mate by throwing him around the dressing - room and smashing him against the floor			1
it is one of several stunning confessions from a television documentary about the @entity2 that charts the club ’s incredible climb in the 1980s from the lower divisions to winning the @entity15 final at @entity16			1
in the programme , which will be screened on @entity19 on @entity20 , it is revealed : @entity1 ( centre ) and @entity0 ( right ) were central figures in @entity4 's @entity2 @entity23 holds the @entity15 on manager @entity25 's head after their fairytale victory in 1988 the wimbeldon team following their victory over @entity29 at @entity16 @entity30 ( second right ) headed the only goal of the game as @entity4 beat the mighty @entity29 several former players including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , goalkeeper @entity23 and @entity38 attended the premiere of the @entity2 in @entity40 on thursday night alongside their ex-managers @entity41 and @entity25 and chairman @entity43 , while @entity0 sent his apologies from @entity45 where he now works as a film actor			1
the documentary described in their own words how a collection of misfits and failures changed the landscape of @entity54 football in the 1980s , partly through a culture of intimidation and violence , towards each other and opponents			0
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity60 ( right ) embrace @entity0 after a goal against @entity62 alongside glory moments like winning promotion to the @entity65 and winning the @entity15 were reminders of darker times , including @entity1 fracturing the eye socket of @entity70 defender @entity69 , @entity0 ending the career of @entity73 defender @entity72 and also squeezing @entity75 ’s testicles			1
but most shocking to fans will be the violence that existed within the club – something @entity1 , a black belt in karate , did little to hide in the film			1
@entity83 to read more about the @entity2 , as former midfielder admits some players broke down in tears from dressing room abuse			1
his close pal @entity0 recalled one dressing - room fight between @entity1 and an unnamed player that left him particularly stunned			1
‘ @entity93 threw him around like a rag doll , i ’ve never seen anything like it , never seen nothing like it , ’ said the tough - guy actor			2
‘ we had wooden benches that went around , @entity93 literally lifted him up , swung him around and smashed him down on the floor and his calf just obliterated			0
‘ the fella had to have 20 stitches or 30 stitches in his calf , split it to bits			0
‘ @entity93 could be hilarious , a very funny man			0
but when he was angry , he was a very tough man			0
he did n’t hold off			2
’ there was also the feud between @entity1 and @entity30 that ended with @entity30 calling a reporter and telling him the striker had tried to karate - kick his legs			1
defender @entity36 was an eye - witness , saying : ‘ we were used to see very unusual things and heavy conflicts but that physical face - to - face coming to blows was the most shocking thing i saw			1
’ and striker @entity119 revealed : ‘ for six years they never spoke to each other			2
they were in the same changing room but would n’t even celebrate together			2
’ @entity1 was an intimidating figure to both the opposition and his own team - mates , it has been revealed referee @entity126 gets an earful from @entity35 and @entity36 during a win against @entity129 @entity70 defender @entity69 was left with a fractured skull after a clash with @entity1 in 1993 @entity30 admits the rift started almost immediately			1
‘ from the first moment , he knew what i was and i knew what he was , ’ he said			0
goalkeeper @entity23 thought @entity30 , who unusually for footballers of that generation held a university degree , regarded the more streetwise @entity140 as pretentious for using words in conversations when he did n’t know what they meant			1
@entity1 comes across as largely unapologetic in the film but does admit at one stage : ‘ sometimes i even wince at some of things we made them do			1
locking them in the boot of their car , dragging them around the pitch in the snow			1
you ca n’t eat for two days , someone will sit there and make sure you do n’t eat			2
‘ i suggested to @entity157 ( @entity36 ) that it might be an idea if we see the manager			1
he did n’t quite understand my @entity54 i do n’t think , because the second time there was no word , i just grabbed him by his nostrils			2
‘ he had one of two choices , you either sink or swim			0
there were days when you thought @entity168 was almost breaking because it was not easy for him			0
@entity0 was @entity4 's midfield enforcer as they made an impact on the top flight of @entity54 football @entity0 gives @entity174 striker @entity173 a piece of his mind during a fiery clash in 1994 ‘ but if he and @entity179 ( @entity37 ) saw us today , they would say " thank you , @entity181 " , you may have beaten the hell out of us but you changed our character			1
’ while some of the @entity2 like @entity35 , @entity0 and @entity187 loved the atmosphere instigated by manager @entity41 and assistant @entity60 , some of the later signings found it hard to cope			1
@entity36 , signed from @entity190 , admits on camera : ‘ the first thing i ’d think about was getting down to the pub and getting away from it , having a drink			1
was it conducive to me playing well ? obviously not as an athlete			0
but at that stage it was a coping mechanism			0
‘ i had some pretty frank , long conversations with my dad , saying , " is this really what i want to do , is this a place i want to be , i ca n’t cope , i am finding it incredibly different "			2
yes , ( it was a ) challenging place to be in my life and around the club			2
‘ i remember getting in the car and getting psyched up for training so i would be able to cope with it , to have the confidence to be assertive			2
i knew if i was that person who was relatively shy and unassuming , the @entity2 would swallow me up			1
’ defender @entity36 is one player who has admitted he struggled to cope with the bullying culture @entity37 , a left back brought in from @entity216 , recalls seeing some players cry at the abuse they received			1
he said : ‘ it was like a pack of wolves going out looking for blood			0
i ’ve seen players actually cry , physically break down and cry			2
it was a place for me that was really dark for six months , socially and emotionally			0
‘ as a footballer you have dreams , for six months i had no dreams			0
i used to sit in my bedroom upstairs , and i ’d say , " my career is gone , where can i go from here ? "			2
@entity60 is unrepentant at creating a culture where only the strongest survived			1
‘ very , very , very tough love , ’ he described it as			0
@entity36 and @entity37 did survive and shared in the @entity15 glory			1
but some of the most savage treatment was saved for opponents , with centre half @entity241 : ‘ we went too far loads of times			0
’ @entity23 and @entity30 show off the @entity15 on an open - top bus - but there were tensions in the squad @entity0 and @entity1 were big mates , but the big striker came to blows with @entity30 @entity187 was a terrier in @entity254 's midfield and worked in tandem with @entity0 to intimidate players @entity257 recalls putting @entity259 ’s nose out of place on one side in the opening minutes of the game and then catching him on the other side			1
@entity0 , who has gone on to have a successful career as an actor playing gangsters and tough guys , summed up the deliberate intimidation			1
‘ there was a few punch - ups , there were a few confrontations , we just went out , “ how dare you think you can walk over us like we are a piece of crap on your shoes ”			0
shut up , bang , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’d look for an opponent who was weak and play on it			0
i ’d say , " @entity281 we ’ve got one here "			0
or he might say " @entity284 , we ’ve got one here "			0
‘ we ’d shout “ put it in the mixer ” , when the ball was in the air you ’d see their legs going , they ’d be thinking “ oh , s * * * ”			0
we were a proper organised force			0
’ @entity41 admits his management philosophy was , " why take 12 passes when you can get it up in one ? "			0
it was refined slightly when he was replaced by @entity25 in 1987 but only slightly			0
‘ he ( @entity25 ) just did what he was told , ’ smiled @entity119			0
the most infamous photograph of @entity4 's @entity303 grabbing @entity75 's testicles the @entity4 story , from non-league to @entity65 in nine years , will probably never be repeated			1
for many of their players , it was a final chance to beat the odds and a new family			1
@entity315 ’s child @entity35 , hod carrier @entity0 and @entity129 reject @entity187 all went on to great careers after leaving @entity4 , their characters moulded by learning at a tough school			1
there was black humour too with @entity41 suggesting setting @entity257 ’s car on fire after he had blocked him getting a pay rise			1
‘ he said “ what am i going to do ” , i said " go and burn your car and claim on the insurance " , ’ said @entity41			0
and the fire did take place			0
it was the violence though that will divide opinion as to whether @entity4 ’s story was a fairytale or a nightmare			2
the last word had to go to @entity35 , of course			0
did he have any regrets ? ‘ not striking @entity30 sooner , ’ he replied			2
@entity19 is to premiere the next instalment in its @entity343 series , the @entity2 , on december 26 on @entity19 at 9pm			2

@entity4 won @entity15 in 1988 after meteoric rise from non-league
@entity349 's *notoriously* hard players were known as the @entity2
@entity0 , @entity1 and coach @entity60 were key members
@entity1 beat up his own team - mates but says it was for their own good
@entity37 and @entity36 both admit being *terrified* by the bullying
shocking accounts told in new film ' the @entity2 '
@entity30 , the *scorer* of the *cup* final winner against @entity29 in 1988 , did n’t speak to @entity1 for six years after *accusing* him of trying to end his career by karate - kicking his legs
@entity36 and @entity37 , who were eventually sold to @entity29 and @entity366 respectively , were terrorised by the bullying *atmophere* at the club
humiliated players would be tied to a car roof or locked in the boot
