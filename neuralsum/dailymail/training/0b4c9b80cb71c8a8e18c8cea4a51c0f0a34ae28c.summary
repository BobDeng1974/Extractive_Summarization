today our methods of pinpointing locations on @entity3 are reliant on space - based satellite navigation systems such as the @entity5 ( gps )			1
but scientists in the @entity7 claim to have found a way to mimic the functions of @entity5 without sending anything into space			1
known as a ‘ quantum compass ’ , this revolutionary method would use the subatomic effects on @entity3 ’s magnetic field and could one day be employed in smartphones			1
modern satellite navigation systems like @entity19 's @entity18 ( artist 's illustration shown ) rely on space - based technologies , but a breakthrough by the @entity7 's @entity24 could lead to @entity3 based ' quantum compass ' navigation systems @entity5 , although one of the great inventions of the modern age , has a number of limitations			1
most notably , it relies on satellites being launched into space			0
@entity35 cold atoms are cooled with lasers to temperatures a billion times colder than outer space			0
at their lowest energies the atoms become the coldest known bodies in the universe			0
these slow moving , low energy atoms are extremely sensitive to changes in the @entity3 ’s magnetic and gravitational field			0
if trapped on a small device , like a trip , their tiny fluctuations can then be tracked from great distances away and their locations pinpointed with a huge degree of accuracy			1
their lack of movement also makes them ideal for atomic clocks which utilise the ultra-regular absorption and release of radiation by their electrons during energy shifts as a highly accurate pendulum			0
current atomic clocks are reliable to one second every billion years , with this limit created by the occasional collision of atoms within the clock			1
however laser cooling the atoms until they are near stationary significantly reduces this effect			0
and the @entity75 has previously warned that the system is at capacity and could be vulnerable to attack			1
but @entity5 is also limited with regards to submarines – when they dive underwater it no longer works			0
this means that when a submarine eventually resurfaces , efforts to locate it can be out by more than half a mile ( one kilometre )			2
a quantum compass would , apparently , reduce that inaccuracy down to just three feet ( one metre )			1
that ’s according to the scientists behind the project at the @entity7 @entity24 ( @entity24 ) in @entity91 , @entity7			2
and the breakthrough is all the more impressive for being impregnable , unlike gps , ensuring that no outside interference can disrupt it			0
‘ there is nothing in physics that could be used - given the knowledge we have now - to disrupt one of these [ new ] devices , ” @entity94 at the @entity95 , who are also involved in the research , said in the @entity98			1
but it ’s not just militaristic applications that make this technology so appealing			2
the scientists say saw quantum compass devices could eventually be used in smartphones			1
currently @entity5 does not work underwater , so when submarines dive and eventually resurface their location can have an error of about 0.62 miles ( one kilometre )			2
a quantum compass could improve this accuracy by a factor of 1,000 , according to the scientists could @entity120 one day be powered by a quantum compass chip and not gps satellites ? according to the scientists , a true quantum compass can be built by 2019 an ion microchip for more compact atomic clocks at the @entity127			1
a portable atomic clock that could be used as a sensor to measure gravitational potential , from the @entity131			0
a portable atom interferometer for greatly improved inertial navigation at @entity134			2
hollow core fibre for a compact , low - power atomic clock at the @entity127			0
graphene atomic chips by the @entity138 for more energy efficient electromagnetic sensors and highly accurate gyroscopes			2
a cheaper , more efficient source of laser cooled atoms that can fit on a postage stamp from the @entity146			0
' the defence industry often acts as a pioneer in the development of new technologies and the potential benefits of a future in which we can navigate by inner space rather than outer space will impact both the military and civilian world , ' says @entity158 , @entity159 at @entity24 , in a release ' @entity162 [ @entity163 ] technologies could bring game - changing advantages to the @entity7 defence sector and support markets measured in billions of pounds , here in the @entity7 and around the world			0
' whilst there are some significant obstacles , it 's exciting to see how well - placed the @entity7 is on the global stage to address the significant technical and systematic challenges that remain in commercialising quantum technologies and accelerating exploitation			2
it ’s understood that companies including @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 are all research such quantum technologies			0
in 2013 the @entity7 announced an investment of £ 270 million over five years researching the possibility of translating quantum science to new products and services			1
aside from navigation , quantum clocks could also be a lucrative market around the world			1
the exploitation of quantum mechanics that underpins the laws of nature at the smallest length scales has already given the world a wealth of new technologies including semiconductors , microprocessors , lasers , nuclear energy , thermal imagers and digital cameras .			0

scientists at the @entity95 reveal new navigation system
' @entity210 ' would use subatomic fluctuations to track location
it can be *embedded* on small chips and could one day be used in phones
the technology could also be used to pinpoint submarine position
@entity95 says a true quantum compass could be built in three to five years
