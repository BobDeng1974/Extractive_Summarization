this brave group of @entity2 veterinary students bar - ed all in a desperate bid to raise cash to pay for their graduation ball			1
the students at @entity8 in @entity9 bravely shed all their clothes for the two shoots which took place on a farm and in their vet school classrooms			2
organiser @entity15 , 24 , told @entity17 there were a couple of awkward moments during the shoots - when a couple of unsuspecting security guards stumbled upon their shoot in the university and a farmer who nearly crashed his tractor into a fence			0
the group of students from @entity8 in @entity9 shed all their clothes for the shoot ten per cent of proceeds from the calender are going to the @entity34 and @entity35 animals snapped in the shoot included horses , dogs , bison , baby guinea pigs , a macaw and a blue - tongued lizard			1
the calender is called vets uncovered and @entity47 photographer @entity46 had the honour of snapping the vets being at one with nature			1
@entity15 , who is from @entity51 but studying in @entity47 , said : ' when we first started to think about fundraising ideas for our graduation ball , i suggested a nude calendar as a bit of a joke			1
animals in the shoot included horses , dogs , bison , baby guinea pigs , a macaw and a blue - tongued lizard			0
@entity66 fun : the vets got up close and personal with the pigs on the farm the students bear - ed all for the unique shoot for their fundraising calender ' a couple of other students jumped on board , and we started to look into it a bit more seriously			1
when we found that it was a legitimate option , we presented the idea to the class			0
' we took inspiration from a vet from @entity85 in @entity86 which has a tradition of publishing barely there nude calenders			0
' we told the class how much money we could potentially make and i think that was when everyone realised that it was actually a serious fundraising venture and not a joke			0
' chilling out : one of the students relaxes with a dog and a hungry horse the calender is expected to raise $ 44,000 and they hope to sell 2000 copies			1
the group of 38 students had two different photo shoots for the calender - one at ms @entity46 's property 100km south west of @entity47 and a second in @entity47 at the @entity107 and @entity108			1
@entity109 said the group was not ready for what they were going to encounter on their first shoot			0
the group got the chance to feel at one with nature on the shoot on the farm outside @entity47 she said : ' i think we all had this idea in our heads that we would probably be able to wear underwear for most of the photos , and strategically place animals and objects in front of us to make it look like we were naked			1
' we were all thrown a little out of our comfort zones when , for the very first photo , @entity46 instructed the students to take everything off , and go stand in the yard with a bunch of cattle			2
' after that , we just had to deal with the fact that we were totally naked with our classmates			0
two security guards stumbled upon the group when they were carrying out a naked study session ' thankfully , our class is full of amazing people , and everyone was so supportive of one another			0
it did n't take long before we were all quite comfortable with it , and we had a lot of fun			0
' the class will be donating 10 per cent of what we raise to the @entity34 and @entity35 , for the development of their @entity154			2
the much anticipated ball will be held at the end of 2015 and the location is yet to be decided			2
