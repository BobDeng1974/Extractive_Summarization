in the end they only won by two , but the way @entity3 were playing it could have been much worse for @entity5			1
a scintillating opening 30 minutes , during which @entity6 and @entity7 found the net , was all it took for @entity12 ’s men to dispatch the visitors			1
when @entity5 midfielder @entity14 saw red shortly after , @entity3 were home and dry			1
the @entity17 ’s attacking blueprint was obvious from the off , but the visitors were powerless to do anything about it			0
in theory it was a simple exercise — win possession from a @entity5 goal - kick , drive forward and pick out @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity26 or @entity27			1
@entity28 was in sublime form at @entity30 recording his 10th league assist of the season @entity6 runs away in celebration as @entity30 erupts after his opening strike @entity6 got @entity3 on their way to a comfortable three points against @entity5 in the @entity38 match hazard shoots and scores to make it 2 - 0 at @entity30 against @entity5 on saturday @entity12 was clearly impressed with his side ’s display , but refused to address talk of the @entity38 title already being in the bag			1
‘ we are playing fantastically but if you do n’t get silverware , it is a frustration , ’ he said			0
‘ do you remember a team that played fantastic football and won nothing ? you remember ones that won			0
’ @entity3 ’s first - half performance showed flashes of @entity60 ’s all - conquering @entity59 side , and fittingly , it was a former @entity59 man who made them tick			2
@entity28 , who recorded his 10th league assist of the season , was the brains behind the operation			1
the £ 30million summer signing pulled the proverbial strings from deep , and with such attacking talent in front of him , he was obviously enjoying himself			0
@entity28 and @entity6 were criticised by @entity72 ( above ) for a lack of commitment to the @entity76 side ‘ i do n’t think i ’m exaggerating if i do n’t remember playing and enjoying a match as much as i did in the first half , ’ @entity28 said			1
‘ it was a beautiful performance			0
we created plenty of chances and had control , ’ the @entity79 told @entity80			0
‘ it is difficult after internationals because the team does n’t have time to work on things but i enjoyed it a lot , particularly the first 45 minutes			0
’ it was apt that @entity28 mentioned the international break as the club versus country issue again dominated the build - up to a @entity3 fixture			1
he and @entity6 withdrew from @entity99 ’s squad for a @entity101 qualifier with @entity102 and a friendly against @entity104 , citing hamstring and groin injuries			2
@entity12 kept @entity3 's unbeaten start to the season intact against @entity5 with a 2 - 0 victory it prompted @entity99 defender @entity72 to say he would like players to show the same commitment to the national side as they do their clubs			1
but @entity12 , @entity72 ’s old manager at @entity116 , dismissed the comments			2
‘ @entity72 is a fantastic player , but he is not a doctor , ’ said @entity12			2
‘ he is not a doctor and i am the same			0
my doctor and the @entity76 national team doctor , they had the scans and decided the player was not in a fit condition to play			0
i do n’t think @entity72 did a medicine masters in the last couple of years to understand it			0

@entity6 and @entity7 netted in @entity3 's 2 - 0 over the @entity5
@entity28 recorded his 10th league assist of the season
