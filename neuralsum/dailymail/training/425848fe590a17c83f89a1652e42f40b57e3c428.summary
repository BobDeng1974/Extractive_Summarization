@entity0 exercises for up to one hour twice a day , six days a week when she is training for sprint triathlons or half marathons			1
but you would be surprised to learn the fitness instructor , from @entity6 - 160 kilometres north of @entity7 - in @entity8 , weighs 90 kilograms			1
this is the issue ms @entity0 has addressed in a post she did for fitness blog @entity11 , saying she wanted people to change their perception of trimness equalling fitness			1
ms @entity0 said people with curvier bodies like hers should be considered as athletes because they trained like athletes and nurtured their bodies like athletes			1
@entity0 , from @entity6 , has penned a blog post about being a plus size endurance athlete ' the only difference is , we 're larger than most people 's perception of an " athlete " so you probably think we 're out there just trying to lose weight			1
and that 's ok - some of us may well be training down to a race weight - just like other athletes do , ' she wrote in a post called ' i 'm @entity39 and i 'm an athlete '			2
despite the fact triathlons and running event having heats for ' plus size endurance athletes ' where ' tens of thousands ' participate , ms @entity0 said these categories of sporting people were yet to make it into the mainstream			1
' why is it that i am in a rather unique position when i present myself as a plus size endurance athlete ? why are n't we all out there seeking sponsorship or promoting our roles as athletes ? ' she wrote			1
most of us do n't even acknowledge ourselves as athletes because we know that physically we do n't fit the mould of what society believes an " athlete " looks like			2
' the 36 - year - old says people need to stop considering athletes as being trim			1
she said people who are her size are athletes too ms @entity0 knows a lot better than some about body image , having weighed 140 kilograms at her heaviest , and kick - started her rise to exercise queen after she found she had osteoarthritis in 2012			1
since finding out about her condition , she has trained for everything from club running events , sprint triathlons and half marathons			2
' i just could n't escape the condition			0
it had come from having a lot of weight on my joints for such a long time , ' ms @entity0 told @entity87			2
' i started out walking and then i started running up and down the side of the house while my daughter was asleep and then i progressed to running outside with her in a pram			0
' the greatest thing that clicked for me is that i stopped what i was doing for weight loss and i started doing it to achieve what i had always dreamed of doing , which was becoming a runner			0
that was a greater thing for me			0
' ms @entity0 trains for up to one hour twice a day , six days a week when she preparing for a sprint triathlon or a half marathon ms @entity0 said she wanted to speak out because she believed young people needed more curvy role models to admire and finally had the courage to speak out about her athleticism			1
' i 've always been big and i 've always enjoyed playing sport from a young age , ' she said			2
' but because i was always such a big child i guess for everybody me just turning up was enough rather than being encouraged to try really hard at it			0
' what tends to happen when you 're a bigger person , you do n't give yourself credit for physical activity			0
people struggle to marry the fitness with the physical body type			2
' in the end we play it down ... and cheapen our experience in fitness and sport			0
' i want people to realise they have within themselves the potential to inspire others and do it without fear of judgement			0
' and it seems a lot of people agreed with ms @entity0 's view point			1
she said the blog post had attracted many positive reactions from readers			0
' it has been incredible - more than i ever expected , ' ms @entity0 told @entity87			1
' so many people said they spent the whole time nodding whilst they were reading it			0
many people related with what i said about " cheapening " our athletic experiences and achievements			0
' others have thanked me for reminding them not to care about what they look like when they are competing and to just get out there and do their best			0
' ms @entity0 said she wanted to speak out because she believed young people needed more curvy role models to admire and finally had the courage to speak out about her athleticism ms @entity0 said her training helped give her the mental resilience she needed to be ' willing to put myself out there '			1
' i think why i got the reactions i did is because body positivity movement in @entity159 is quite young in comparison to the @entity161 and @entity162 and places like that , ' she said			0
' it 's a sign of people wanting to have that conversation about body image , particularly in sport			0
' the mother - of - one , who is now pregnant with her second child , is still working but can not wait to get back to her regular routine			2
' i ca nâ€™t tell you how much i miss it			0
i have a due day and a return to training date , ' ms @entity0 said .			1
