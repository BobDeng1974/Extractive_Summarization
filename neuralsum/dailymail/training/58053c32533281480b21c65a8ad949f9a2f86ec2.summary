read @entity1 's story about @entity2 being axed for this week 's @entity4 games after breaking protcol to see an @entity7 concert the match officials travel rules @entity2 flouted last weekend were brought in because me and my heavily pregnant wife were threatened and abused by two thugs after a game at @entity14			1
one of them even made gesture as if to shoot me			0
back then we used to drive ourselves to games , park in the club car park and walk to the ground			1
unfortunately after @entity14 played @entity23 in 1995 , two supporters approached me in a very aggressive manner			1
@entity2 will not officiate next weekend 's games after breaking strict protocol on travelling to games @entity2 drove alone to @entity29 v @entity28 at the weekend so he could see @entity7 perform @entity30 wanted to discuss the incident that saw @entity32 ( centre ) injured in a clash with @entity35 the procedure for match - day officials is : 1			1
match officials must meet at the designated hotel which is relatively close to the ground four hours before the advertised kick - off of the game they are due to officiate 2			1
they have a meeting room for their use and have full refreshments available to them 3			0
all four officials must attend and generally they will discuss the upcoming match , any previous history and individual knowledge that will be useful in the management of the match 4			0
their cars are left at this hotel for safety and security			0
there is a people carrier laid on for transport to the ground which drops the officials off at the players ' entrance 5			1
the same is done in reverse for the journey home i was only able to escape physical harm due to the quick thinking of one of my guests			0
there are a number of historic incidents of referees ' cars being vandalised - this was n’t helped by the fact that some referees choose to have personalised number plates			0
but after this @entity14 incident it was clear our safety was in question and something had to change			1
@entity23 won that game 3 - 2 and i had sent off @entity88 late on			1
after the game , i had a drink in the lounge which was standard practice before heading to my guest 's car , with my wife in tow			2
it was dark and just as we got to the car , two supporters started shouting obscenities at me and calling me biased because i was a southerner			0
one went inside his pockets and made a gun motion to my head			0
at this moment , my guest opened the car and got my wife in			0
i used my kit - bag to protect myself from an incoming punch , threw the bag in the car and then drove away			2
on the monday after i filed a report to my superiors and at the next meeting of referees - we met every fortnight - the issue of safety was raised			0
i was n't the only referee to suffer trouble - i remember another ref had his car attacked after he got stuck in traffic on @entity124			1
@entity125 ( right ) sends off @entity14 's @entity88 at the @entity126 against @entity23 in 1995 it is also alleged that @entity2 had a telephone conversation with @entity28 manager @entity30 in his car and this was facilitated by him not using the people carrier back to the hotel after the game			1
the reason these conversation should not be taking place on a one - to - one basis is that there are no witnesses to protect the referee over allegations of what he is supposed to have said or not said			2
@entity2 should be well aware of this after two previous cases of his , the @entity145 incident at @entity146 and the @entity148 row at @entity149			1
it quickly became apparent that we had to change our rules and adopt the system in place from @entity155 for @entity157 games , where @entity159 refs obviously did n't have their cars and were escorted to and from the ground along with their officials			1
the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) , the governing body of @entity4 referees , therefore changed their rules for the start of 1996 - 97 season and set the new protocols for a very good reason			1
@entity2 knows this and should adhere to that protocol			2
last weekend , after officiating @entity29 ’s game with @entity28 , he chose to ignore a very straightforward system designed for his personal safety and his integrity - and that of his colleagues			1
the procedures mean : for @entity29 matches , the hotel used to be just one mile away from @entity180			2
however , this has been changed to a city centre hotel in @entity183 that is still only four miles from the ground			2
so there was really no need for @entity187 not to take the people carrier – even if he was keen to get up to @entity190 for a pop concert			1
@entity2 was cleared of allegedly making inappropriate comments to @entity145 in 2012 read @entity194 's profile of @entity2 's controversial career the vast majority of officials adhere to the official protocol			1
however , there were odd occasions when i did something similar due to personal commitments			0
i remember leaving @entity204 and getting on the @entity205 to go to a concert with my wife which , in hindsight , was n’t wise			0
on another occasion i did feel it was right for me to break the protocol after a @entity4 match at @entity146 in 1996 because i had to get to @entity214 airport to fly to @entity157 for a @entity155 tournament			0
i was given permission to take my own car to @entity218 and follow a police car immediately after the game to get me to @entity214 in time for my flight			2
it is very difficult planning a life outside of your refereeing duties when you only find out at 3pm on monday which game you have the following weekend – so i do have some sympathy for @entity187			0
@entity228 ( january 2014 ) @entity2 was cleared by the @entity229 after @entity149 complained about comments he made to midfielder @entity148 - which were first revealed in @entity232			2
@entity233 ( october 2012 ) @entity2 was accused of using ' inappropriate language ' towards @entity146 midfielder @entity145 during their 3 - 2 defeat by @entity237			2
@entity2 was eventually cleared after investigations from the @entity229 and @entity239			0
@entity145 was fined £ 60,000 and given a three - match ban for threatening @entity187 after the match			0
@entity242 row ( decemeber 2009 ) @entity2 sent @entity243 off for two yellow cards in a match between @entity246 and @entity247 , having earlier asked the @entity246 bench : ' how do you work with @entity242 all week ? ' @entity250 ( august 2008 ) he was sacked by the @entity163 board after allegations he owed £ 60,000 following a failed business deal			1
in february 2009 , after an appeal , he was reinstated as a @entity255 but suspended for eight months from august 6 - the date of his original ban - for ' issues relating to his private business affairs '			0
@entity261 ' goal ' ( january 2005 ) @entity2 and his assistants failed to award a @entity261 goal for @entity264 at @entity265 , despite the ball clearly going over the line before @entity237 keeper @entity268 fumbled it clear .			0
