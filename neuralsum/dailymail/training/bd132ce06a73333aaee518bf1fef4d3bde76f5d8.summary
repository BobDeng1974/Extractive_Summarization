by @entity0 last updated at 2:36 pm on 23rd december 2011 goalmouth to gantry : @entity3 in his role as a pundit for @entity6 @entity3 has demanded action from @entity8 after a user said he should ‘ go hang himself like @entity11 ’			2
as the row over racism in football rumbled on , the abusive @entity8 finished with ‘ ok negrito ’ – a reference to @entity18 ’s comment to @entity19			1
the @entity21 player was banned for eight games and fined £ 40,000 after using words that ‘ included a reference to mr @entity19 ’s colour '			2
the news that @entity27 is to be charged with racially abusing @entity28 during a match , and a storm of anger over @entity33 's reference to ' coloured ' players has only served to bring the issue of racism in football to the fore in recent weeks			1
the racist abuse @entity3 has been subjected to began in the wake of his comments on the @entity33 incident , in which he tried to highlight the problem of racism in football			1
@entity3 , who won three @entity46 caps and is now a @entity6 pundit , also linked to a number of other posts apparently voicing support for @entity18 using highly offensive racist language			1
@entity3 ’s online argument started after he was quoted in response to @entity33 ’s remarks on @entity55 on saturday			2
he highlighted his links to racist comments , saying ‘ you tell me there ’s nothing to address ’			2
a poster called @entity62 then tweeted ‘ @ @entity63 do us a favour @entity66 and go and hang yourself like @entity11 did please			0
also mocking the former player 's admission that he suffered from depression			0
he then continued to abuse @entity3 before his misspelled defence of ‘ @entity73 um i racest			0
’ @entity33 was forced to issue an apology after being dragged into the racism row by referring to black players as ‘ coloured ’			1
in a discussion of the controversies surrounding @entity46 captain @entity27 and @entity21 striker @entity18 , @entity33 used the word as he praised the achievements of black players in the @entity84			1
but many viewers objected to the term – considered offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same – and the @entity89 yesterday received more than 100 complaints			0
as @entity3 tried to address the serious issue of racism in football , users began their sick mocking others were quick to defend the former @entity97 international , however , with @entity8 users and former mp @entity99 describing the outrage at @entity33 ’s comment as an overreaction			1
@entity33 , who is thought to earn about £ 40,000 a show , used the term ‘ coloured ’ twice on wednesday night ’s edition of the @entity107 programme as he and fellow pundit @entity108 talked about racism in football			1
the discussion happened on the day it was revealed @entity27 will face a criminal charge over allegedly using racist language on the pitch			1
the 56 - year - old said : ‘ i think there ’s a lot of coloured players in all the major teams and there are lots of coloured players who are probably the best in the @entity84			0
‘ if you look at 25 or 30 years ago it was probably in a bad way – not as bad as some of the other nations on the @entity129 – but certainly there is always , always room for improvement			0
’ confrontation : @entity134 captain @entity27 allegedly called @entity136 's @entity28 s ' f * * * * * * black * * * * ' during a match punished : @entity21 player @entity18 has been handed an eight - match ban by the @entity140 for racially abusing @entity141 's @entity19 after the row over his comments blew up , @entity33 said in a statement : ‘ i unreservedly apologise for any offence caused			1
‘ this was never my intention and i deeply regret the use of the word			0
’ a senior @entity107 sport insider said the pundit was ‘ mortified ’ about the comments , which came after a ‘ really long ’ and ‘ challenging ’ day in the studio			1
they suggested that the heightened ‘ sensitivity ’ around descriptions of race on the football field may have led him to resort to a word he does not usually use			2
‘ he is not a racist at all , in any sense , ’ they added			0
but @entity167 footballer @entity166 tweeted : ‘ does anybody think that people are just jumping on the bandwagon about the @entity33 comment ? ’ another observer wrote : ‘ massive overreaction about @entity33 calling black players “ coloured ” ! he ’s just old school			0
’ and another added : ‘ got to feel for @entity33			0
praising black @entity84 players and condemning racism in football only for some idiots to take offence – ridiculous			1
’ controversy : @entity107 pundit @entity33 , left , came under fire for using the word ' coloured ' on @entity55 , and appeared to anger fellow commentator @entity108 , right @entity46 captain @entity27 was told this week that he must appear in court next year to answer a criminal charge of using racist language on the field			1
to the fury of anti-racism campaigners , top officials at the @entity140 stayed silent after the footballer was formally summonsed yesterday over an outburst against a black player during a @entity84 clash			0
the multi-millionaire defender – who denies any racial abuse – also continued to enjoy the backing of his club , @entity134			0
he is accused of calling @entity28 a ‘ f * * * * * * black * * * * ’ during the match at @entity136 ’s @entity201			0
but afterwards he told @entity28 , whose brother @entity203 plays alongside @entity27 for @entity46 , that the remarks had been taken out of context , insisting he actually said : ‘ @entity207 , @entity28 , do you think i called you a black * * * * ? ’ @entity27 will first appear in court next february but the case is likely to drag on for up to six months as lawyers prepare for a trial			1
the maximum punishment @entity27 faces is a £ 2,500 fine , a sum he earns in just two hours and 38 minutes on his £ 160,000 - a - week salary			2
last night , @entity27 , 31 , said he was ‘ disappointed ’ with the decision and that he hoped to clear his name ‘ as quickly as possible ’			2
he said : ‘ i have never aimed a racist remark at anyone and count people from all races and creeds among my closest friends			0
