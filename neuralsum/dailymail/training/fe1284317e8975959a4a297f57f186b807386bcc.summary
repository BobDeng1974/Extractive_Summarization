scientists have sequenced the oldest complete human genome			0
the dna comes from an anatomically modern man who roamed @entity4 45,000 years ago			1
it provides experts with a more accurate timeline of when modern humans mated with their @entity10 cousins as they moved from @entity11 into @entity12 , between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago			1

the dna comes from an anatomically modern man who roamed @entity4 45,000 years ago			1
his remains were fund near the settlement of @entity18 ’ - @entity19 in western @entity4 in 2008			1
a view of the river @entity21 and the village is pictured the male lived around the time the populations of @entity12 and @entity26 divided			0
his remains were found near the small village of @entity18 ’ - @entity19 in western @entity4 in 2008 when an ivory hunter looking for mammoth tusks stumbled across the bones on the banks of the @entity21			1
they are believed to represent the oldest radiocarbon - dated modern human outside @entity11 and the @entity34 , according to the study in @entity36			0
dr @entity37 , of the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , retrieved dna from the man ’s thighbone			0
by studying the make - up of the man 's dna , scientists discovered that the male lived around the time the populations of @entity12 and @entity26 divided			0

the orange dots indicate @entity10 , blue @entity53 and green , modern humans the relatively complete human femur was discovered on the banks of the river @entity21 near the village of @entity18 ’ - @entity19 in western @entity4 in 2008			1
radiocarbon dating of the bone showed it to be about 45,000 years old			0
‘ the morphology of the bone suggests that it is an early modern human ; that is an individual related to populations that are the direct ancestors of people alive today ’ said @entity60 , the anthropologist who analysed it			0
. ‘ this individual is one of the oldest modern humans found outside the @entity34 and @entity11			2
' together with colleagues , she then sequenced and analysed the genome of the individual and found he had a similar level of @entity10 ancestry as contemporary @entity76 and @entity12			2
their study , led by @entity79 , suggests that @entity10 genes flowed into his ancestors 7,000 to 13,000 years before he lived			0
experts previously thought that interbreeding between anatomically modern humans and @entity10 occurred anywhere between 37,000 and 86,000 years ago			1
the new study narrows down this huge window of opportunity to between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago , which coincides with the expansion of modern humans into @entity12 , and possibly @entity26			1
this was decided by studying the segments of @entity91 in his genome , which were much longer than the ones found in present - day humans			2
more complex than a simple march of progress : the study suggests that interbreeding between anatomically modern humans ( illustrated right ) and @entity10 occurred between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago , coinciding with the expansion of modern humans into @entity12 ‘ we present the high - quality genome sequence of a 45,000 year - old modern human male from @entity4 , ’ dr @entity103 said			1
‘ this individual derives from a population that lived before - or simultaneously with - the separation of the populations in western and eastern @entity111 and carries a similar amount of @entity10 ancestry as present - day @entity111			0
’ chemical ratios in the bone indicated the man would have lived on berries , nuts , vegetables , meat and fish			0
she added : ‘ interestingly the @entity18 - @entity125 individual probably lived during a warm period that has been proposed to be a time of expansion of modern humans into @entity12			1
’ scientists sequenced the oldest complete human genome from a thigh bone of an anatomically modern male , found to be 45,000 years old			2
they compared it to the genomes of present - day humans from more than 50 populations			0
they found that the @entity18 ’ - @entity19 bone comes from a male individual who is more related to present - day people outside @entity11 than to @entity11 , showing that he is an early representative of the modern population that left @entity11			1
when his genome was compared to people outside @entity11 , he was found to be approximately equally related to people in @entity26 and people that lived in @entity12 during the @entity146			2
@entity79 explained : ‘ the population to which the @entity18 ’ - @entity19 individual belonged may have split from the ancestors of present - day @entity111 and @entity150 populations before , or at about the same time , when these two first split from each other			1
‘ it is very satisfying that we now have a good genome not only from @entity10 and @entity53 , but also from a very early modern human			0
’ paleoanthropologist @entity159 , who was involved in the study , said : ‘ it is possible that the @entity18 ’ - @entity19 individual belonged to a population of early migrants into @entity12 and @entity164 , who failed to leave descendants among present - day populations ’			1
the experts found that about two per cent of his dna came from @entity10 – similar to the proportion found in present - day @entity76 and @entity12 .			2

genome provides experts with a more accurate window into exactly when modern humans mated with their @entity10 cousins
it occurred when they moved from @entity11 into @entity12 , between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago - a more accurate date than previously known
@entity91 was *collected* from a bone found near @entity18 ’ - @entity19 in western @entity4
