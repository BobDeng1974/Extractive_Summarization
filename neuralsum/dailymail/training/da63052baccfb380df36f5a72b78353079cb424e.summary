for years women were unable to serve on submarines because of possible health risks but , after an independent review found that only pregnant women should not serve , @entity16 , the defence secretary , lifted the ban in december 2011			1
lieutenants @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 ( left - right ) have made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the @entity4 today , mr @entity16 said : ‘ this is not only a huge personal achievement for these three outstanding officers , as they take up their new roles supporting the ultimate safeguard of our national security , but also an historic moment for the @entity4 and our armed forces			1
’ following the arrival of woman officers , female ratings ( non-commissioned personnel ) will start training later this year with a view to serving on @entity39 submarines in 2015			1
female personnel will also be able to serve on @entity42 - class submarines from around 2016			2
ring ring goes the bell : after 110 years of the @entity47 , pioneering lieutenants @entity6 , @entity46 and @entity8 have become the first women to serve onboard a @entity39 class submarine during their training , previously only undertaken by men , the three women officers conducted operations on nuclear - powered @entity39 @entity54 , passing their rigorous final exams with flying colours , and will now embark on careers in the @entity12			1
lt @entity6 , from @entity58 , @entity59 , said : ‘ i wanted to be able to say that i had made the most of every opportunity that i had been given in the @entity4			1
‘ it 's very intense and very challenging but that 's what makes it so rewarding			2
at the end of it , when you get your dolphins and are accepted into the submarine community , it 's great			0
’ describing the reception from the 165 male members of the 168 - member crew , the 29 - year - old , who has been in the @entity4 for four years , said : ‘ as long as you can do your job and you 're good at what you do , i do n't think they cared whether you were male or female			1

she said : ‘ i kept volunteering and volunteering until it came in			0
’ she admitted that the three women might have ‘ stuck out ’ on board , but said : ‘ they were really receptive			1
having a slower process of introducing a few females first in the officer cadre and then ratings has helped			0
we have n't just knocked on the door of a submarine and said ' can we come to sea please ? ' ‘ i felt like a little sister to 165 brothers			0
you live as a very strange family			0
once we got qualified they were glad for us the same way they had been glad for hundreds of submariners before			2
‘ at the end of the day manpower is a big thing for the @entity4 – as long as you can do the job , it does n't matter			1
’ @entity6 will serve aboard @entity54 as a logistics officer she added : ‘ we did a long patrol , we 've come across most things people want to know about , like how you live and how the guys get on with you			2
‘ i know there 's people who are interested but they have n't been able to make an informed decision			2
‘ of course it 's been challenging , but women are absolutely capable of doing this job			1
i think that change can always be a bit of a shock , but i look forward to seeing more and more women getting on board			0
’ describing the living conditions on board , she said : ‘ it 's slightly more cramped that you would be used to			2
actually you bring your perspective in so you do n't see the lack of space anymore – you see the space that 's there			0
‘ it 's a bit of an odd place to live – everything smells the same , it all has this diesel oily smell which you have to get used to			0
but it 's not a horrible place to live			0
always a rover : lt @entity7 , 26 , from @entity97 , the @entity98 , was inspired to volunteer to serve on submarines after childhood visits to see @entity101 at the @entity102 in @entity103 ‘ i managed to have a shower every day , we had laundry facilities			0
and food becomes a massive part of your day , it 's a routine you get into			0
’ lt @entity8 , 39 , from @entity94 in @entity95 , said : ‘ you limit your horizons			0
i found i just forgot about the existence of some things – someone asked me if i missed bananas			0
i had n't even noticed until they mentioned it			0
i just forgot the outside world , you get a whole new world			0
’ after their training , lt @entity6 will continue her logistics officer post on board ; lt @entity7 is undertaking deputy weapons engineering officer training ; and lt @entity8 will become an education officer			0
@entity54 's commanding officer commander @entity82 , who oversaw their training , said : ‘ i was impressed with how seamlessly the three women integrated on board			1
‘ they qualified without any difficulty and two of them even completed additional training whilst at sea			2
‘ as i would expect , they were accepted as integral members of the ship 's company by the rest of the crew and have really paved the way for women on submarines to be business as usual from now on			1
’ second sea lord vice admiral @entity209 said : ‘ women have been serving in ships at sea with the @entity4 for more than 20 years and integrating them into the @entity12 completes their inclusion into all seagoing branches			1
