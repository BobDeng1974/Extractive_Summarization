on a day made remarkable by many things , not least the sheer scale of the turnout , the courage of one man was always going to shine through			0
staring death in the face but refusing to flinch , @entity5 deserved every full - throated cheer and moist - eyed tribute delivered at @entity10 yesterday			1
crippled by the motor - neurone disease that will eventually claim his life , @entity5 was just able to take the ceremonial kick - off in an exhibition match between a @entity15 and @entity5 's @entity16 , stumbling and tumbling to the turf moments after making contact with the ball			1
an emotional @entity5 was carried around the stadium at the end of a tribute match at @entity10 @entity5 ( centre ) was greeted by supporters after arriving at @entity10 for the game if that was a heartbreaking sight for all who turned out to thank the @entity29 for his contribution to the club , it is worth noting what happened after he fell down			1
with the help of his former team - mates , he rose again to take the applause of 41,349 paying punters			1
why were so many moved to venture forth on a dreich winter 's day for a bounce game involving old boys in varying states of ( dis ) repair ? it was an appreciation not just of what @entity5 did in his playing days , but of how he is facing down this horrifying illness			1
' even the fact that @entity48 patients do n't have more than three years to live does n't get me down , ' he said in an interview conducted for the commemorative programme			0
' scared ? no , because what 's going to happen is inevitable			1
ok , maybe i have only a couple of years left			0
that does n't scare me , it 's just that i would love to live a lot longer			1
i want to see my daughter growing up			0
that 's what i 'll fight for			1
' one person should be the first to defeat this terrible disease			1
well , let me be that person then ! i will show the world what fighting spirit means			2
' but if death comes , well , it comes			0
what can you do about it ? i 've always been like that			0
never been afraid of flying either , unlike most of my @entity72 team - mates ( from his time with @entity75 at @entity76 )			2
' i always told them : ' if we go down , we go down '			0
which was quite likely with those @entity72 aircraft , by the way ! @entity5 ( left ) watches on from the dugout during the match at @entity10 @entity5 ( centre ) is carried by @entity85 ( left ) and @entity86 ( right ' i do n't want to feel too much sympathy			1
please do n't treat me that way			0
it will be tough but i 'll keep my head up			0
' it was a shock ( when i got the diagnosis )			0
especially after i had googled what the illness exactly means			0
all of a sudden , you know you may be dead within a year			0
' i still hope the doctors have made a mistake			0
that , one day , they will say it is n't @entity48			0
as long as i do n't have the really heavy symptoms of @entity48 , it 's a straw i keep grasping at			2
' i know it sounds strange but being chased by the @entity104 does n't affect your life that much			2
not when your motto is : ' @entity108 '			0
' we avoid pessimism and depression by not talking and thinking too much about the disease			2
that 's one of the reasons why we do n't shoot an enormous amount of footage of our life as it is today			1
' for my daughter , @entity120 , that would put too much emphasis on the illness			0
' @entity10 was packed full of supporters offering tributes to former player @entity5 the money raised from yesterday 's match will be split four ways , with @entity5 and young @entity120 each receiving a share , and the remainder going to @entity131 and the @entity132			1
among those to have contributed include old foes @entity135 — with a £ 10,000 donation — a fact that did n't greatly surprise the man himself , as he revealed : ' it is n't true that all @entity135 supporters have always hated me			0
' when i was playing for @entity76 , lots of @entity143 tourists wanted to have their picture taken with me on the @entity145 — even @entity135 fans			0
so i must have done something good			0
' @entity5 had been back to @entity10 in a playing role since his departure for @entity15 , turning out for @entity76 in a friendly			1
in a very familiar way			0
the crazy traffic , the huge queues that saw kick - off delayed by half an hour , it was like a throwback to more successful times in @entity158			2
former @entity15 winger @entity159 noted : ' it 's great to see such a big crowd at @entity10 again			1
i gave @entity5 a hug and said : ' this feels like the old times '			1
' fans held banners , scarfs and signs and chanted @entity5 's name during the tribute the former @entity172 warrior was accompanied by @entity120 as he made his way between a guard of honour formed by both teams before kick - off , the atmosphere creeping closer to spine - tingling levels as he slowly marched out			1
with his ability to speak severely damaged by the disease , the look of joy on @entity5 's face said as much as words ever could			1
the game itself was , of course , an afterthought , a 7 - 4 romp for the @entity16			2
@entity191 , @entity192 , @entity86 and @entity193 scored for the home team , while @entity195 was among the many visitors to find the net — the first time this particular former @entity15 player had ever scored at @entity10			1
there was only one choice for @entity202 , though , @entity5 lauded again as his name was announced , then receiving a further standing ovation as he came back on the pitch for a lap of honour			1
he was carried aloft on the shoulders his team - mates , borne ever higher by the goodwill of all in attendance			2
@entity5 ( centre ) lifts the @entity214 trophy as a player for the club in 2005 and the last word went to the man himself , in a way , too , when his close friend @entity221 read out a statement on his behalf declaring : ' @entity223 , thank you for your support today			1
the numbers who turned out make me feel so happy			2
it gives me a fighting spirit			0
' when i played here , i gave everything for the world 's most successful club			2
now the club and the fans have given me so much more back			0
' i 've never been so proud to be a @entity15 man			1

former @entity15 *captain* @entity5 has motor - neurone disease
thousands turned out at @entity10 to show their support for @entity5
the disease will eventually claim the @entity29 's life
