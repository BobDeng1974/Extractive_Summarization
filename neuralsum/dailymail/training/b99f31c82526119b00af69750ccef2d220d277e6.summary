damaged : an @entity1 @entity7 ( similar to the one pictured ) flew for five days before ground crews noticed that 30 screws were missing from one of its wings the gaffe was revealed in an internal union document leaked to @entity23 news agency @entity22			1
@entity1 have blamed aircraft mechanics in the @entity9 city of @entity26 , were the airline 's jets are often serviced because of lower costs			1
an @entity1 technical operations spokesman said : ' the plane flew for several days before it was grounded because one third of the screws holding down a piece of bodywork were missing			1
' it was part of the outer covering of the wing and at no point was flight safety compromised			2
tragedy : the @entity1 concorde crash 11 years ago killed 113 people and was blamed on a strip of metal on the runway which punctured the plane 's tyres and sent rubber fragments flying into a fuel tank july 25 , 2000 : @entity53 from @entity55 airport in @entity10 to @entity56 in @entity57 , crashed just after take - off			1
