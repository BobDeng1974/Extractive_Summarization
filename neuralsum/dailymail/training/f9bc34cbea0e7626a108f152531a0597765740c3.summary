@entity0 spender : people spend £ 30,000 a year on their garden , a third of which goes on planets homeowners spend £ 30,000 on their garden over a lifetime , a study has found			1
researchers found the typical green - fingered adult will spend a third of the amount on plants alone			1
the rest of cost includes keeping the lawn , flowerbeds , shrubs and trees in tip - top condition , as well as forking out for garden buildings , ornaments and patios			1
the survey by online garden centre , @entity25 , asked 540 gardeners about their spending habits			0
they found gardeners spend £ 9,500 during the course of their life on plants alone			1
this included buying seeds , bulbs , bedding plants , shrubs , trees , grass seed , turf and vegetable plants			2
the second highest expenditure was on hard landscaping at £ 9,000 , with homeowners changing their patio or deck six times over the course of their gardening lifetime			1
garden furniture , including tables , chairs and outdoor lighting accounted for £ 3,600 of the total amount			2
those questioned said they needed something decent to sit on or relax in to enjoy their garden which explained why furniture was updated or replaced around eight times			2
this was closely followed by essential tools like spades , forks , rakes , shears and secateurs which totalled just under £ 3,500			1
gardeners admitted to spending over £ 1,800 on their sheds and greenhouses claiming they replaced their shed four times and even their greenhouse twice			1
the cost of garden electrics , including a lawnmower , strimmer , hedge trimmer and garden vacuum , came in at £ 1,320 with the remaining spend , £ 720 , being used on the barbecues gardeners purchased for the summer months			1
one male gardener , who was involved in the research , said : ‘ i spend hours in the garden but had no idea quite how much it was costing me			2
about £ 3,500 is spent on essential tools like spades , forks , rakes , shears and secateurs ‘ for that i could buy myself a decent car or give my daughter a deposit for her house			1
i see my garden as an investment – if it looks good then it adds value to my property which has to be a good thing			0
’ a female respondent added : ‘ plants are my biggest weakness			2
even if i just pop to the garden centre for a browse around , i end up leaving with a car full			0
many i do n’t really need – my garden is full up already , but i always manage to find a space to plant it in , even if it means digging up something else and giving that to a neighbour			0
’ another added : ‘ i never scrimp when it comes to garden furniture			0
it has to look good and it has to be comfortable			0
my husband loves pottering around in the garden			0
i like to use the garden for relaxing – a sun lounger on the deck with a glass of wine beside me and a good book is my perfect summers day			0
‘ the second highest expenditure is on hard - surfacing with adults changing their patios six times @entity125 from @entity126 said : ‘ i would imagine very few gardeners would expect their garden to be costing them £ 30,000			1
‘ many of the tools and electricals can last for years			0
it ’s only plants that you need to buy every year so it ’s very easy to lose track of how much you are actually shelling out			0
’ a study last year found those who spend their free time pruning the roses or pottering in the vegetable patch are trimmer than their non-gardening neighbours			1
women were a dress size smaller , while men who went to an allotment could expect to be around a stone lighter			0
previous studies have credited gardening with a host of benefits , from raising zest for life to boosting happiness .			0

a third of the expense is spent on plants alone , researchers found
second *priority* is hard landscaping , homeowners change patio six times
@entity0 - fingered adults also spend £ 3,500 on spades , rakes and shears
