by @entity0 @entity2 dictator @entity1 has been pictured smiling with delight as he witnessed the test launch of new ' cutting edge ' precision guided missiles			1

the image emerged a day after claims from @entity15 that three short - range projectiles had been fired from the @entity2 towards its waters			1
the @entity2 has yet to say when the latest launches took place or how many missiles were fired			0
and there is no independent confirmation that @entity2 has developed such high - tech missiles having frequently bluffed and exaggerated about its military capability in the past			0
but the impoverished nation devotes much of its scarce resources to its missile and nuclear programs			0
outside analysts say @entity2 has developed a handful of crude nuclear devices and is working toward building a warhead small enough to mount on a long - range missile , although most experts say that goal may take years to achieve			0
@entity49 spokesman @entity48 said that @entity2 has been trying to upgrade its large - caliber multiple rocket launch systems in recent years and that the range of the weapons has been gradually increased in each test - launch			2
@entity2 media has called the latest missile launches ' significant ' because they were made at a time when it is bolstering its national defense blaming @entity59 and @entity15 for being ' extremely reckless in the moves to isolate and stifle ( @entity2 ) and unleash a war of aggression			1

@entity2 also test - fired two medium - range ballistic missiles and exchanged artillery fire with @entity15 near a disputed boundary in the @entity79			1
both @entity90 routinely conduct artillery drills near the maritime boundary , a scene of several bloody skirmishes in recent years			0
