it 's good to be @entity1 — and for 21 - year - old @entity3 , it 's good to look like @entity1 , too , particularly as the @entity5 student has been built a career on impersonating the superstar singer			1
of course , it 's not just her strikingly similar resemblance to 25 - year - old @entity1 that 's helped @entity11 private appearances and live concerts where she performs the shake it off singer 's greatest hits ; the @entity18 , @entity19 , native can also sing , dance , and act just like her lookalike			1
' i first became a fan of her music , and it was n't until , like , five or six years later when i realized , hey , i could really market this , ' she says			0
after @entity1 's second album , @entity38 , came out when @entity3 was 15 , the student asked her older brother to teach her how to play @entity40 — a relatively simple song with only four chords			1
with looks and musical ability now in her arsenal , @entity3 was able to start making money as a tribute artist			1
' i started to hear the rumor , " @entity1 goes to our school " , and moms would hire me out for birthday parties , ' she told @entity54 , and explained that early gigs would earn her about $ 30			1
' i ’d come , sing a few songs , and wear a sparkly dress and they loved it , ' she told @entity60			0
flattering immitation : @entity3 started to learn to play @entity1 's music when she was 15 after classmates told her she looked like the star copycat performer : not only has @entity3 , left , learned to sing and play music by @entity1 , right , on the guitar , but she has also practiced copying the singer 's facial expressions and way of speaking eventually @entity3 learned @entity1 's entire musical catalog , started designing corresponding costumes , and even studied the singer 's mannerisms to improve her impersonations			1
she still works at parties and even nursing homes , but now her biggest gig is performing with @entity79 , a concert series that includes artists impersonating the likes of @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity85			0
last summer , @entity3 performed with @entity79 for two month in @entity86 , @entity19 , and when she graduates from college in may she 'll go on tour with the show , starting in @entity90 , @entity91 and ending in @entity92 , @entity93			2
' [ i 'm ] so excited to start designing outfits and song lists for future shows [ sic ] , ' she recently said on her @entity99 account			0
parallel careers : as @entity1 releases new music and debuts new costumes on tour , @entity3 adds new elements to her own impersonations and while she looks forward to @entity1 's new material first and foremost as a fan , the @entity108 singer 's growing and evolving career also means @entity3 gets to have more fun with her own career			2
' i think she ’s breaking boundaries and creating new genres , ' she said			0
' that gives me the opportunity as a tribute artist to do a lot of different things			2
' this is n't the first time that one of @entity1 's lookalikes has come forward			0
last month , the singer herself discovered another doppelganger online , posting a picture of her ' twin ' , @entity128 resident @entity127 , on @entity129 , while commenting : ' lol i thought that was me			0
