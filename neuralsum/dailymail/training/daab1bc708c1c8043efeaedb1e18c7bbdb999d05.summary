@entity0 said her death was a source of ' enormous regret ' but did not apologise tragedy : @entity6 could have survived if rank and file firefighters at the scene had been allowed to do their job and bring her out a lawyer who fell 45ft down a mine shaft died after fire chiefs refused to mount an immediate rescue operation because of health and safety fears			1
@entity6 , 44 , was left lying in agony in the cold and dark for eight hours with several broken bones			1
a report into her death yesterday found she could have survived if rank - and - file firemen had been allowed to do their job and bring her out			1
one fireman had been lowered down while a paramedic was strapped up in a harness ready to follow			2
but bosses refused to use a winch to lift out the mother - of - two because they were slavishly following rules which said the equipment could only be used to save their own staff			2
instead they waited through the early hours of the morning for a police mountain rescue team to arrive			2
mrs @entity6 was lifted out but died shortly afterwards from a heart attack brought on by hypothermia			1
last night her stepfather @entity34 , 69 , said : ‘ they need to ask why people are using health and safety as an excuse for failure , rather than a reason for success			2
’ the case is the latest example of emergency service personnel putting their safety ahead of those they are supposed to be rescuing			2
ten - year - old @entity50 @entity49 , of @entity51 , drowned in a pond in 2007 after two police community support officers said they were unable to help him due to health and safety regulations			0
earlier this year coroner @entity57 said the emergency services must be prepared to ‘ risk their lives ’ after hearing how red tape cost vital minutes during @entity64 ’s @entity63 gun massacre			0
mrs @entity6 fell down the 45ft mine shaft , part of a coal mine that closed in 1926 , at 11.30pm while taking a shortcut home across a field near @entity71 in @entity72 after visiting friends in july 2008			1
she was found by her teenage daughter before @entity0 arrived and fireman @entity75 was lowered to the bottom of the shaft			1
the collapsed 60ft mine shaft in a field behind @entity6 's house scene : police at the scene of the collapsed mine in @entity71 , @entity72 , where mrs @entity6 was trapped for seven hours mrs @entity6 was still conscious but had a collapsed lung , several broken ribs and a broken sternum			1
while the rescue operation was in progress , group commander @entity88 arrived as a media relations officer			0
he assumed command after realising he was the most senior officer there			0
his first move was to stop a paramedic who was already strapped in a harness from being lowered			0
and he refused to allow colleagues to rescue her using ropes because they had not received the correct training			0
mr @entity88 feared they could be sued if the mission failed			0
' i found their evidence bullish , if not arrogant , in their determination to justify the subservience of the need to carry out a rescue to the need to fulfil to the letter … brigade policy ' incredibly , he told a fatal accident inquiry that the operation had a ‘ successful outcome ’ because the casualty was ultimately removed from the shaft			1
mr @entity88 is still in the fire service and is on the waiting list for promotion to divisional commander			1
@entity0 expressed ‘ enormous regret ’ , but refused to apologise until after the report was published last night			1
in the report sheriff @entity125 said mrs @entity6 might have survived if she had been removed sooner			2
he said mr @entity88 and colleague @entity126 were ‘ focused on self - justification for the action or non-action taken by them ’ and did not reflect on lessons that could be learned from the tragedy			0
the sheriff added : ‘ i found their evidence bullish , if not arrogant			1
’ rescue operation : police at the scene the sheriff criticised the fire service 's failure to recognise the urgency of a rescue , noting the firefighter had told the inquiry ' there was not a huge concern about the time ' yesterday @entity147 ’s first minister @entity146 ordered a fresh inquiry			1
mrs @entity6 ’s mother @entity149 , 67 , said ‘ the public will lose all confidence in the fire service ’ if the inquiry fails to ‘ lead to something positive ’			1
she added : ‘ some people have said to me that if the same thing happened again , they would n’t even phone 999 – they would get a rope and do the rescue themselves			0
’ and mrs @entity6 ’s father @entity158 described his daughter ’s death as ‘ a needless waste of life ’			1
he said his granddaughter @entity163 , 17 , still had nightmares about finding her mother , adding : ‘ she knew when she cried down to her mum that she was still alive			0
’ @entity6 with daughters @entity168 , left , and @entity163 , right			1
she stepped into a disused mineshaft which had collapsed opening up a 45ft drop he added : ‘ i hope no other family finds themselves in the same situation as we did			2
’ and mr @entity34 said he felt the fire service ’s apology had been ‘ forced upon them ’			1
he added : ‘ i just feel have they been prompted by the fact that the first minister has asked for an inquiry			2
‘ they did not seem interested in apologising yesterday or earlier today			0
it ’s difficult to see whether i can honestly accept it under the circumstances			0
’ former watch commander @entity189 – who had been ordered to rewrite the rule book on rope rescues weeks before the tragedy – yesterday spoke out against his former employers			0
mr @entity189 , 52 , had warned bosses that changing the rules to prevent firemen using ropes to rescue people was ‘ a disaster waiting to happen ’			0
he said : ‘ many incidents you go to in the brigade do n’t end with a successful resolution			0
sometimes the person can be dead before you get there , sometimes you just ca n’t help people			0
this was not the case for mrs @entity6			2
it ’s not the fire service ’s finest hour			1
’ last night the @entity212 said there was no uniform approach to the uses of winches in forces across @entity218			0
however , it said that health and safety legislation must not be ‘ allowed to constrain incident commanders when making decisions in dynamic emergency situations ’ .			0

@entity6 left at bottom of collapsed 45ft mine shaft for six hours
she suffered fatal heart attack brought on by hypothermia
inquiry found fire service evidence ' bullish , if not arrogant '
@entity0 said her death was a source of ' enormous regret ' but did not apologise
