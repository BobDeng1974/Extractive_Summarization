by @entity0 last updated at 1:39 pm on 21st october 2011 archaeologists have discovered two pieces of astonishing art dating back around 2,600 years depicting a woman giving birth - the oldest such image ever found in the western world			1
the artefacts were at the heart of an ancient @entity11 settlement in @entity13 ’s @entity12 , near @entity14			0
the incredible images were on a small fragment from a ceramic vessel dating back to around 600 @entity18 , and show the head and shoulders of a baby emerging from a mother , believed to be a goddess			1
ancient : the small image of a woman in childbirth is the oldest ever found in the western world and incredibly it was discovered by @entity30 , a graduate student at the @entity31 in @entity32 who is legally blind and was on his first ever dig. ' i found the artefact at the beginning of my second week there , ' he said			1
' it was quite dirty , and we were n’t sure what it was until it was cleaned at the on - site lab and identified			0
' it was thrilling to find out that it was so significant			0
to make a discovery like that , which provides important new information about a culture we know so little about , is exactly what makes archaeology and anthropology so appealing			0
” this goddess is shown with her knees raised and her face shown in profile , one arm raised , and a long ponytail running down her back the excavation of the area is a project of @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , and the @entity70 , in collaboration with @entity72 in the @entity73			1
cultural : the site is in a @entity76 valley close to @entity14 , pictured , an area full of historically important artefacts the identification of the scene was made by dr. @entity81 , an expert from @entity72			1
' we were astounded to see this intimate scene ; it must be the earliest representation of childbirth in western art , ' he said			1
' @entity11 women are usually represented feasting or participating in rituals , or they are goddesses			0
now we have to solve the mystery of who she is and who her child is			0
' the @entity11 civilisation were from ancient @entity13 in the area corresponding roughly to @entity76			1
they came to prominence in 700 @entity18 before being absorbed into the @entity98 in the 1st century @entity18 experts believe there is considerable evidence that early @entity102 was dominated by @entity103			0
they were particularly famous for their art , particularly sculpture and pottery , like the wine jug pictured above , cast metal idols , wall - painting and bronze work			1
thematically its art was strongly connected to religion and gods , as well as the afterlife			1
the ceramic fragment is less than 4 x 3 cm from a vessel made of bucchero			1
@entity118 is a fine , black ceramic material , embellished with stamped and incised decorations , used as eating and drinking vessels for the @entity11 elite			2
typically , stamped designs range from abstract geometric motifs to exotic and mythical animals			0
there are no known @entity128 or @entity129 representations of the moment of birth shown as clearly as this example until more than 500 years later			2
the image also gives clues about the role of women in that society			2
scholars are certain that for some part of its history it was a sacred spot and the abundance of weaving tools and a stunning deposit of gold jewellery suggests that a women god is what the people there may have worshipped			0
' this is a most exciting discovery , ” said dr. @entity152 , professor emerita of classics at @entity154 and a world - renowned expert on the ancient @entity103			2
' it shows an image of a type so far unknown in @entity11 context , and gives us plenty to think about as we try to understand its religious significance			2
' a paper about the find will be presented at the annual meeting of the @entity168 in @entity169 in january .			0

the ceramic image is thought to be 2,600 years old and was found in @entity76
' it must be the earliest representation of childbirth in western art , ' @entity72 expert says
