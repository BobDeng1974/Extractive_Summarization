health chiefs in @entity1 have been forced to recruit more than 70 @entity3 nurses , amid a staffing crisis gripping the country 's health system			1
it has emerged the situation in recruiting staff to posts in the @entity11 is so desperate that managers have resorted to interviewing potential candidates via @entity14			2
it comes as experts blamed a failure to reach @entity19 waiting times , in part , on an inability to recruit doctors and nurses across the @entity24			1
new figures published yesterday revealed @entity19 waiting times have reached their lowest levels in @entity27 in a decade			0
the @entity28 has recruited more than 70 nurses from @entity3 , some having been interviewed via @entity14 , amid a staffing crisis in the @entity11			1
file picture just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within the four - hour time - short of the 95 per cent target dictated by the @entity11 in @entity27			2
however politicians highlighted @entity36 are still performing better than those in the @entity11			2
in november , just 83.3 per cent of patients in @entity39 were seen within the four - hour time period , short of the 95 per cent target			0
as well as a rising number of patients across the @entity24 , experts warned a staffing crisis is hampering emergency departments			1
responding to the @entity27 figures yesterday , dr @entity47 , chief executive of the @entity48 , said : ' hospital trusts trying to recruit more staff have been hamstrung by the short - sighted cuts to nurse training places , which mean there simply are n't enough nurses in the system			0
' this is made worse by chronic under - resourcing of community services and social care , which means more people end up in @entity19 who could be better treated elsewhere			0
' forty - five of the 70 nurses recruited have started working at the region 's three major hospitals , including @entity67 in @entity68 , pictured @entity69 in @entity70 will also welcome some of the 70 new nurses recruited from @entity3 health officials in @entity1 said 45 of the 70 new nurses have already started work at the region 's three major hospitals , @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 in @entity70 and @entity76			1
the remaining nurses are expected to move to @entity39 to start work this year			2
hospitals recruited almost 6,000 overseas nurses last year , a four-fold increase on the previous year			0
four out of five new @entity11 nurses are foreign , with managers flying to @entity3 and @entity84 to hire up to 50 at a time			1
figures released last month show that hospitals hired 5,778 foreign nurses last year , up from 1,360 the year before			0
however there are fears that severe staffing shortages are leading managers to lower the bar for recruits ’ @entity27 skills			0
last month the @entity95 visited a recruitment fair in @entity97 , @entity84 , where @entity98 hired four nurses			0
a spokesman for the @entity28 admitted that it , like many other @entity11 bodies , was ' struggling to recruit new recruits from within the @entity24 '			1
the board is working with @entity68 and @entity104 to train nurses to degree level			1
but the process takes three years , and the need to recruit new staff is immediate			0
the spokesman said : ' we need to attract qualified nurses			0
' the requirements have not changed			0
it takes a period of time to get degrees , you also need experience			0
' during 2014 we recruited more than 70 nurses from @entity3 ; 45 of these have now moved to @entity39 and taken up their posts , with the rest due to join us this year			1
' he added that all new @entity3 nurses spoke @entity27 and some were also in the process of learning @entity127			2
' we do not require staff to learn @entity127 as a condition of their employment , ' he added			0
' where a post requires a @entity127 speaker then this forms part of the recruitment and selection criteria			0
' however , as a health board we do provide active support to staff who wish to learn to speak @entity127 and a number of the nurses from @entity3 have expressed an interest in and have commenced learning the language			1
' @entity145 health minister @entity144 said : ' there have been consistent problems in the recruitment and retention of doctors and nurses across @entity1 for some time , so it is pleasing to see action to begin to address staffing shortages			1
it comes as experts said the staffing crisis - an inability to recruit sufficient numbers of doctors and nurses from within the @entity24 - is hampering efforts to improve waiting times in @entity19			1
ambulances are pictured queuing outside the accident and emergency department at @entity39 in @entity167 new figures published on tuesday , revealed @entity19 waiting times in @entity27 have fallen to their lowest levels in a decade with just 92.6 per cent of patients seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target			0
but despite the poor performance , politicians have pointed out @entity36 are performing better than those in the @entity11 , where just 83.8 per cent of patients were seen within four hours in november ' what matters most to hospital patients is not the birthplace of their nurse , but that medically trained nurses are on hand in sufficient numbers to provide safe and high quality care			2
' while recruiting nurses from abroad suggests the scale of recruitment problems in @entity39 , many patients will welcome increased nurse numbers on hospital wards in @entity1			1
' the use of @entity14 to interview prospective employees may seem unorthodox for the @entity11 but it is a tool which is often used to interview remote candidates by private businesses and can help to keep recruitment costs down - i have no problem with it			0
' however , @entity199 @entity1 assembly member @entity198 said : ' for such a large organisation , it ’s surprising that the health board is unable to plan its workforce recruitment without having to use an agency to go to @entity3 to recruit additional staff			1
' nurse training at @entity207 has been reduced in the past couple of years and now we ’re seeing the results of that with having to go overseas to recruit 70 @entity3 nurses			1
' it smacks of stop - gap measures rather than long - term planning and , although i understand the nurses in question are very experienced and highly qualified , you have to wonder how long they intend to stay in @entity39			2

the @entity11 in @entity1 has recruited more than 70 nurses from @entity3
it comes amid staffing crisis affecting @entity11 bodies across the @entity24
45 of the 70 nurses have already moved to @entity39 with the rest set to follow
