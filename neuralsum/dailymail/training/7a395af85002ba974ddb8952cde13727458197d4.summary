by @entity0 published : 23:37 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 01:17 est , 23 december 2012 a @entity5 @entity4 report revealing the nation 's fastest growing states in the last year has seen the population flocking to the nation 's best places for the warmest weather , lowest taxes and one with an oil rush to boot			1
topping the list , @entity12 was found having secured a 2.2 per cent growth over the last year - three times the national rate - after becoming the second highest oil - producing state behind @entity17			1
in close second , the @entity18 was found with a 2.1 per cent growth , @entity17 with 1.7 per cent , @entity21 with 1.6 per cent , and @entity22 with 1.5 per cent			1
hot and cold : a report by the @entity25 has revealed the top 10 states that have seen a population boom in the last year , seen in red , along with the worst , seen in blue @entity30 states : with a 2.2 per cent increase , @entity12 dominates the list in booms with the @entity18 coming in second oil boom : trucks sit outside a row of temporary housing units for oil workers in @entity39 , @entity12 after an oil rush made it the second largest oil state last year just behind @entity17 using figures collected between july of 2011 and july of 2012 , the report attributed @entity12 's oil rush to its boost of 10,000 additional residents			1
but what may come as more of a surprise is their high unemployment rates			0
while @entity12 is benefiting from a rare 3.0 per cent unemployment rate it 's a stark contrast from the other top nine boomers who together average 8.1 per cent			1
in comparison , @entity56 , found in 10th place for positive domestic migration and sixth for fastest growing , has seen a 12 per cent unemployment rate			2
@entity18 , ranked second on both lists , has seen a rate of 8.9 per cent			2
in contrast to population boom , states experiencing the fastest exit by residents are @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 according to the report with the one exception of @entity74 - in fourth place - linking colder climates between them			2
land of opportunity : @entity12 's oil boom is attributed for their surge in domestic immigrants while the state mutually glistens with a 3 per cent unemployment rate fleeing : @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 were found to have the highest rate of residents leaving the states as seen here housing boom : workers in @entity12 work to construct homes with the oil boom putting pressure on the state 's tight housing market as far as taxes go , four of the top 10 states were found with the lowest rates in the country - those being @entity99 , @entity21 , @entity17 and @entity56			1
high birth rates are also credited in four of the top 10 states of @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
among the top states nation - wide , however , @entity22 was found with the highest rate with 12.8 per cent , @entity106 in second with 11 per cent , @entity17 with 8.3 per cent , @entity108 with 7.2 per cent , and @entity18 with 6.8 per cent			1
interestingly the report notes @entity110 as responsible for this growth , with @entity22 , @entity112 ( with 6.7 per cent growth ) and @entity56 having the highest concentrations of @entity115 in the @entity5 floundering in that category - however leading in deaths - are @entity118 and @entity119 whose population are said to be seeing more deaths of baby boomers than births			1
in all , the @entity5 population was found now increasing a bit faster , thanks to an improving economy , but not enough to lift growth above its lowest level since the @entity131			1
the nation is getting older and is less likely than before to be married , with women waiting longer to have children , if at all			0
immigration from other countries is on an upswing after years of sharp declines during the recession but may never return to the peak level it reached in the early 2000s			0
weather relations : seen in winter , @entity67 , left , and @entity68 , right , were found with the worst rates of domestic migration , with the list of top 10 states all sharing cold weather with the exception of @entity74 religious influence : @entity22 has been named winner of highest births in the country with @entity110 claimed responsible for the growth the 2012 estimates released on thursday offer the latest snapshot of the @entity5 population , showing signs of revival and change in pockets of the @entity5 , especially in @entity161 states hard hit during the recent recession			1
' after decades of wars , a depression , immigration surges , baby booms , boomlets and busts , we are entering a new era of modest growth , ' said @entity172 , a demographer at @entity173 who analyzed the numbers			0
' this is a result of our aging population , lower fertility rates and immigration levels that will probably not produce sharp population spikes			0
' as a whole , the @entity5 population grew by 2.3 million , reaching 313.9 million people			1
that growth rate of 0.75 per cent was higher than the 0.73 per cent rate in 2011 , ending five years of slowing growth rates			2
nevertheless , the rate of growth remains stuck at historically low levels not seen since 1937 , restrained by reduced childbirths			0
over the last year , the economy has shown improvement , with the unemployment rate declining modestly and @entity5 migration edging up after hitting a record low in 2011			1
as a result , states including @entity17 , @entity12 , @entity102 , @entity195 and @entity119 posted population growth increases as many young adults moved out from their parents ' homes , seeking to test the job market in areas with thriving economies in energy or technology			1
still , the nation continues to get older , due to aging baby boomers and fewer people in their child - bearing years			0
newly released census projections now show that @entity5 growth may have largely peaked , barring a significant and sustained increase in new immigrants			1
the numbers put @entity5 growth in the next year or two at just under 0.8 per cent , before flattening and gradually falling to rates of about half a per cent , a level unseen in more than a century			1
religious influence : @entity22 , their capital 's spire seen left in @entity220 , saw the highest rate of births in the last year with the report attributing @entity110 to the gain @entity5 growth reached a high in 1950 of more than 2 per cent , lifted by the @entity226 baby boom			1
immigration to the @entity5 was on the uptick in 2012 after falling significantly during the downturn , although it remained far from the level seen during the mid- 2000 housing boom			1
@entity232 is expected to debate an overhaul of immigration law next year			0
' we will now need to cope with population challenges that past growth has left us — notably , the needs of a large aging baby boom population which will require resources for its medical care , and the social and economic integration of first - and second - generation immigrants , ' @entity172 said			2
the @entity25 released state population estimates as of july 1 , 2012			2
the data show annual changes through births , deaths , and domestic and foreign migration			0
the data suggest that the impact of the recession on formerly fast - growing @entity161 states may be waning			0
@entity56 had more residents move into the state this year after suffering migration losses in previous years			2
@entity259 and @entity260 , two other housing boom - and - bust states , also showed renewed migration gains after seeing their growth drop off sharply at the end of the last decade			2
in all , 26 states grew faster this year compared to the previous year , of which 19 are in the @entity99 and @entity265			0
' these gains remain far smaller than those each state experienced during the economic boom , but reflect considerable improvement over the situation at the depths of the recession , ' said @entity274 , a sociologist and senior demographer at the @entity276 , referring specifically to @entity259 , @entity56 and @entity260			0
in contrast , @entity277 , @entity67 and @entity69 saw more residents move away compared to the previous year			0
@entity12 grew faster than any state in the nation , climbing by 2.2 percent from july 2011 to july of this year			1
the @entity18 was next - fastest growing , followed by @entity17 , @entity21 and @entity22			0
two states lost population : @entity71 and @entity284			0
@entity285 , president of @entity286 , said if the 2010 census had been held this year , @entity287 would have lost a seat in the @entity290 and @entity291 would have picked up one due to the shifting population figures			2
based on continuing losses , @entity71 is now on track to lose one of its two seats with just 33,000 people to spare — potentially to the gain of @entity195 , which is about 59,000 people away from gaining a sixth seat			0
@entity108 remained the most populous state , followed by @entity17 , @entity67 , @entity260 and @entity68 .			0

@entity12 topped list with 2.2 per cent growth over the last year after becoming the second highest oil - producing state
@entity5 population found increasing but not enough to lift growth above its lowest level since the @entity131
