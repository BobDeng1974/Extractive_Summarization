by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:51 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:11 est , 18 december 2013 anyone who has ever had that sinking feeling when the eyes of the person they are talking to start to glaze , take heart - an app has been developed to make you less boring			1
@entity12 + is an app for @entity16 's @entity15 video chat service that analyses what you are saying and makes suggestions based on how you are behaving			1
for example , if you are constantly using words that it considers too negative it will display ' try to be more positive ' on the screen			2
' it was developed by @entity12 artists @entity42 and @entity43 , who aim to make people more personable , but are also making a statement about modern communication			1
a video outlining how the app works shows ' @entity50 ' moaning to her mother about a woman in her yoga class she percieves as selfish			1
after a short time she is told to be less self - absorbed , so she changes tack and asks her mother how she is			0
word in edgeways : if one person blathers on for more than a minute their microphone is disconnected her mother answers the question vaguely and slightly evasively , hinting at a problem in her life but revealing little , so us + accuses : ' what are you hiding ? @entity50 is speaking much more honestly			1
' another interesting - and potentially very useful - feature is demonstrated in another dialogue example : the automute			0
@entity12 + uses @entity72 and @entity73 , a text analysis software programme that calculates the degree to which people use different categories of words when they communicate			1
it determines whether the speaker is using positive or negative emotions , self - references , causal words , and other language patterns			2
it also uses @entity84 , which analyses the tendency of participants in a conversation to use a common vocabulary and similar sentence structures			0
if you speak for longer than a minute the app automatically switches off your microphone so the other person can have their say			2
a panel on the right of the screen displays information about how positive , self - absorbed , feminine and aggressive the talker is being			0
ms @entity42 , who says the project is also an art installation , does admit to fears about the way technology like this can be applied			0
she told @entity106 : ' with a big company like @entity16 building products , there 's a lot of room for them to determine what 's the optimal social behavior they 're trying to achieve			0
' and then they have the audience and tools to really make that happen , ' she notes			0
she personally demonstrated this possibility by hacking the app while on a videom chat with her boyfriend secretlt controlling the feedback he received to messages like : ' you should sound more positive ' and ' you should make @entity42 smile more '			1
moan moan moan : a businessman giving bad news is told to put a different spin on a tricky presentation if one of the users is not standing up for themselves , the app encourages them to show their assertive side			0

@entity12 + uses speech analysis technology to suggest *improvements* to chat
if you 're moaning too much it will tell you to be more positive
the app even shuts off your microphone if you are talking for too long
