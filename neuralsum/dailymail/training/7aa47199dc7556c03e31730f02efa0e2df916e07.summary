by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:11 am on 4th january 2012 the @entity3 killers will be sentenced as juveniles and could serve as little as 12 years for @entity6 ’s most notorious race murder			1

they will then be considered for release on parole after serving the minimum term			0

however , the court can take into account the fact that @entity3 ’s murder was racially aggravated			2
@entity42 , prosecuting , told the @entity43 that in a case of this age the law requires a court ‘ to sentence to effectively what would have been the punishment shortly after the crime had been committed ’			0
