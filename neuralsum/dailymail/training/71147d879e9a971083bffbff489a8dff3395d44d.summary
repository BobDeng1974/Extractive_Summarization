his fist - pumping ' @entity2 ' celebration has become a big noise in recent weeks , but the @entity5 manager admits he would like to hear his defenders turn up the volume as they prepare to face @entity8 in the @entity9 this week			1
the sight of @entity11 making his way to the club 's support and whipping the fans into a ferment has added colour to the @entity19 football season but , while the boss may ooze flamboyant charisma , he admits his team is short of like - minded rabble - rousers			1
out with the warrior - like presence of his captain @entity28 and , when he is in the team , the ebullience of on - loan striker @entity25 , @entity11 admits his team lacks natural leaders , the sort of men who use words to spark their colleagues into action			1
@entity36 has called for more discipline from his team following their 3 - 3 draw with @entity8 the silent treatment may suffice when facing the routine @entity41 opposition but , step up a level or two to the @entity43 , and the @entity45 reckons he could be doing with a lot more communication among his defenders			1
his two full - backs , @entity49 and @entity50 , may like to attack with a certain flamboyance but are among the most reticent footballers you could ever meet			1
at 19 , @entity54 has the makings of a quality centre - half but has yet to find his voice			1
even @entity58 , a man not short on belief in his own abilities , has had to be coaxed out of his shell by the club 's coaching staff			1
goalkeeper @entity64 , meanwhile , asserts his authority by exuding a @entity67 - like calm			1
two rare errors from @entity64 may offer a partial explanation for the first - leg 3 - 3 scoreline from three nights ago but @entity11 would also like the men in front of him to assert themselves better			1
he knows his team must score at least once in @entity75 to have any hope of progressing to the last 16 but a clean sheet would do just as much to help			2
the portents are not good — @entity5 have shipped an eye - watering 23 goals in 13 @entity82 matches this season and the prospects of finding a way to plug all the gaps between now and thursday appear slim			1
@entity5 striker @entity25 scored injury - time goal to secure an improbable draw against @entity8 that wo n't stop @entity11 trying			1
organisation will be key on the @entity8 's home patch and that 's likely to be a central theme in training this week			2
' i think we can keep a clean sheet but we have to cut out the easy mistakes and improve the communication in the team , especially at the back , ' said @entity11			2
it will be a great achievement if we go through and beat them in @entity8 , but the players have to talk more			2
' i think they need matches like this , that 's important			2
our central defenders are both young and very talented and there 's a lot of attention on them when they play these games			1
they have to deal with that			2
' there are 20 clubs coming to watch them			2
so it 's mentally tough , especially for young players			2
' we have to bring it out of them			2
we have @entity123 who talks with the players around him but it 's very important to get experience into that central spine of the team			2
it 's also something to look for when we 're bringing in players — a leadership style			0
' @entity64 speaks a lot with his body — he 's very calm and reads situations very well but he could also be more vocal			0
@entity58 has stepped up in that way , he 's much better than he has been , but he 's still young			0
so to have an experienced central defender could be a good thing			0
' having held on to @entity58 in the face of interest from @entity142 clubs , including @entity143 and @entity144 , it seems likely that @entity5 will cash in on the @entity146 international hopeful at the end of the season			1
@entity25 connected with @entity150 's pass with a left - footed finish to score against the @entity153 giants @entity11 has repeatedly gone on record with his desire to extend @entity54 's loan transfer from @entity157 into a second season but the @entity159 has been less willing to talk up the chances of another year at @entity161			1
if @entity11 does indeed find himself in the market for a centre - half with an old head and an active tongue , it wo n't be through choice			1
' if i had to choose , i would not bring anybody in , ' he insisted			0
' i 'd stick with the two i have because they have the future in front of them			0
' that @entity11 is talking about communication is instructive			0
six months ago , the @entity45 had the more fundamental issue of fitness on his mind as his players struggled to adopt the high - tempo pressing game he had deployed at his previous club @entity181			1
in the first leg against @entity8 , @entity11 's team was unrecognisable from the group that laboured against @entity185 and , to a lesser extent , @entity184 in the @entity188 qualifiers			1
' we looked fit , ' he agreed			0
' we kept at @entity8 for 90 minutes , pushed them backwards and could keep them under pressure for good periods			0
' we were not able to do that six months ago			0
' i think we saw that against @entity185 — the team could n't cope with it and lost the game big time			0
so we are taking steps all the time , showing that everything is possible			0
' we scored three goals against an @entity153 team , a @entity199 team , so it 's a good performance			1
the sad part is we gave away two easy goals			0
' we have to defend more in @entity75 but also we have to vary our pressure			0
the key is to stay compact for 90 minutes because you know they have players who can exploit your mistakes quickly			0
' although @entity8 have been displaying shaky form domestically , the concession of three goals in @entity213 on thursday was an anomaly — in the previous eight @entity82 ties played this season , @entity199 's defence had been breached only twice			0
@entity218 ( left ) and @entity219 congratulate @entity220 after @entity5 's second goal the thrust of @entity49 down the right flank was instrumental in unsettling @entity8 , with the full - back showing drive and then composure to square the ball for @entity220 and kick - start the comeback from 2 - 0 down			1
@entity220 and his old @entity230 pal @entity219 were both excellent on their home debuts for the club and they have added extra pace to the mix. ' i think we have a lot of speed in the team now and players who can do something , ' said @entity11			0
' the relationships in the side are better , so we create things from the sides			0
' the end of the match brought @entity11 on to the pitch but there was to be none of his trademark theatrics , just a few waves of gratitude at the part played by the crowd on a memorable night			0
while accepting that a 0 - 0 scoreline might statistically have given his team a better chance in the return leg , you suspect he would n't have changed a thing about the emotionally - charged match that ended on the crescendo caused by @entity25 's stoppage - time equaliser			1
' for me , football is about entertainment , we have to entertain the fans and also get results , ' he added			0
' the @entity5 fans are intelligent , they have seen so much football and they know what they like			1
' they were happy because we gave everything and also because we tried to create and attack			0
' you have to believe in a style but i 'm not doing this for romance , i 'm doing this to get results and i believe we can do it			0

@entity5 drew 3 - 3 in the @entity287 round of *32* first leg
@entity290 is calling for a more disciplined performance in the return *fixture*
he insists there must be more communications among his defenders
