the holiday of the future will still provide memories of strolls along sunny beaches , the sensation of sand between your toes and the peaceful rush of the ocean , but there will be one crucial difference			1
you wo n't have ever actually been away - in fact you might not have even left your home			0
instead , people will download memories to their brains to make them feel as if they have been on a sun - kissed holiday			1
that ’s just one of the many realities we could face as we learn to manipulate the human mind , @entity21 physicist dr @entity20 told @entity26 in an exclusive interview			1
visionary : dr @entity20 is best known for his expertise in theoretical physics but his latest book takes a look at how rapid advancements could bring about huge changes in how we understand – and use – our brains dr @entity20 is best known for his expertise in theoretical physics – his previous books have dealt with topics such as parallel universes and the cosmos			1
but his latest book , @entity44 , takes a look at how rapid advancements could bring about huge changes in how we understand – and use – our brains in the next 50 to 100 years			2
his theories on the future of the mind are wide - ranging , from the possibilities of telepathy to controlling ‘ programmable matter ’ with our thoughts alone			1
at times , his opinions sound purely like science fiction – but he ’s convinced that these are developments we ’ll see not just in the distant future , but by the end of the century			1
of particular interest is the ability to implant memories			2
‘ first of all , someone goes on vacation before you , and pleasant memories such as walking on the seashore and picking up rocks are put on a disc , ’ dr @entity20 told @entity26			1
‘ then they 're uploaded into your own mind ; relax , and there you are at the beach			0
‘ feel the wind at your face , hear the sound of the waves , all the sensations – you ’ll have a memory of a very nice walk on the beach in some exotic location , that ’s what this person before you felt			0
‘ these things are within the realms of possibility – it ’s only a matter of time			2
’ wish you were here ? in the future we may never set foot on a tropical beach when we go one holiday , we could just visit them virtually through downloads we place inside our brain , dr @entity20 says all this will be made possible by significant advancements in our understanding of the brain			1
as dr @entity20 points out , we have learned more about the brain in the last 15 years than we have in the rest of human history			1
and crucially , our knowledge of the map of neural connections in the brain , known as the connectome , is rapidly improving			0
this is thanks to machines such as @entity116 scanners that can see which parts of the brain light up as a person performs different activities			0
‘ in the short term , we ’re going to be able to connect our minds to computers , so that we ’ll be able to control exoskeletons , ’ he said			1
dr @entity20 was born in @entity126 on 24 january 1947			1
he led a distinguished academic career , attending @entity128 and the @entity129 , @entity130 – where he received his phd in 1972			0
his studies focused on theoretical physics , and he is continuing to search for a so - called ' @entity134 ' that unites the four fundamental forces of nature – the strong force , the weak force , gravity and electromagnetism			0
today he popularises physics to the public and has appeared on numerous tv and radio programmes			0
he has also written various popular science books including @entity146 : the @entity147 for the @entity148			0
his latest book , the future of the mind : the @entity152 to understand , enhance , and @entity153 , was number one on the @entity155			2
‘ we ’ll be able to perform primitive forms of telepathy , we ’ll eventually record memories , and then @entity161 's patients will be able to push a button and memories will flood in			2
‘ beyond that , the @entity164 will be replaced by the “ brain - net ” , where you can convey emotions and memories rather than just text			2
’ further into the future , probably the 22nd century , we could control surrogate robots on alien worlds with our minds , so we can explore space without physically having to go anywhere , according to dr @entity20			1
‘ maybe aliens have already done this , and we ’re walking into the middle of an interstellar system where people commute regularly to planets and stars , and we ’re too stupid to know it , ’ he said			0
on telepathy , dr @entity20 says we can already take someone who ’s totally paralysed , hook them up to a computer , and allow them to send messages on the internet			1
in the future , you could ‘ walk into a room , mentally turn on the lights , internet , answer emails , call up for a movie			2
indeed the computer mouse will gradually be phased out			0
this will be made possible thanks to programmable matter – the dream of creating tiny little dust particles with the power of a pc , known as catoms , that can change their electric charge and be rearranged – all by our minds			1
at the moment we are ‘ nowhere near getting down to a grain of sand , ’ but dr @entity20 insists this can be addressed in the future			1
‘ in principle , in the future – mid-century – when you walk into a room , you ’ll mentally control all computers which are invisible – like @entity222			1
‘ what he does with his wand is rearrange matter so one object turns into another			2
‘ that ’s the goal of programmable matter , to have the ability like a @entity231 late in this century , we might have full power			1
’ dr @entity20 's theories on the future of the mind are wide - ranging , from the possibilities of telepathy to controlling ‘ programmable matter ’ with our thoughts alone ( artist 's impression of neuron , pictured ) he added : ‘ someone from the outside watching us would think we ’re sorcerers			1
’ advancements in brain manipulation have important moral implications in the future , too , according to dr @entity20			1
‘ [ you could ] fire a gun and record that , and insert it into an innocent person ’s brain so he thinks he fired a gun when he did n’t			0
’ dr @entity20 says it will be entirely possible that we will one day be able to upload entire skills into a person 's brain			1
to become a doctor , for instance , someone could have all the relevant medical terminology and procedures uploaded into their mind			0
however , he does not think this will make education obsolete , as people will still need to learn how to use this information			2
' if you want to be a great chess player , learning the moves of chess is not enough , ' he said			0
' you have to chew on it , you have to regurgitate games of the past			0
' in the future , you 'll be able to learn the basic rules of calculus , but if you think “ what does it mean ” and “ how can i apply this in new situations ” , then you have to chew on it , and that you have to do yourself			2
' innocent people can be fooled into believing they have carried out a violent crime that never took place , a study has revealed			2
psychologists found that during just three hours of interviews , adults could be convinced they had perpetrated a theft , an assault , or even attacked somebody with a weapon when they were a teenager			0
people can be fooled into believing they have carried out a violent crime that never took place using suggestive memory - retrieval techniques , the researchers were able to trick 70 per cent of the participants into believing they had committed an offence			0
the effect was so strong that the participants ended up providing detailed descriptions of things that had never actually taken place ‘ our findings show that false memories of committing crime with police contact can be surprisingly easy to generate , and can have all the same kinds of complex details as real memories , ' said lead researcher @entity317 , from the @entity318			2
‘ all participants need to generate a richly detailed false memory is three hours in a friendly interview environment , where the interviewer introduces a few wrong details and uses poor memory - retrieval techniques			0
’ after hearing a false account of their teenage crime - peppered with true details of their life at that time - the participants appeared to ‘ internalise ’ the fabricated story			0
this highlights the fundamental malleability of memory , said dr @entity333			0
‘ this research speaks to the distinct possibility that most of us are likely able to generate rich false memories of emotional and criminal events , ’ she said			0
but if all of this sounds a bit daunting , dr @entity20 we may be able to look for guidance not on @entity346 – but in the discovery of intelligent races elsewhere in the cosmos who ' mentally communicate ' with each other			1
' some of my friends who listen for messages think [ first contact ] will happen in the next few decades , ' he said			0
although dr @entity20 thinks that estimate is a bit soon , he said it was possible that if contact is made , a race could be an ' alien consciousness ' rather than a physical being like humans , and he does not necessarily think they will be dangerous			1
that itself brings a suggestion that they may be more like the ' @entity369 in @entity370 ' , where people are all linked to a single consciousness			0
he said such a future for humanity was ' not impossible ' , and ultimately the ' ability to liberate ourselves from the inconveniences of the human body ' would allow us to explore space like never before			0
until , then , we 'll have to make do with downloadable holidays , programmable matter and learning new skills at the touch of a button .			1

@entity21 physicist dr @entity20 was speaking exclusively to @entity26
he revealed his theories on how we may control our brains in the future
include implanting ' memories ' to make us think we *'ve* been on holiday
could also send our minds to distant worlds to control surrogate robots
we 'll be able to manipulate our surroundings with ' programmable matter '
creature from another world would think that we were ' sorcerers '
