an incredible image reveals a rare moment of calm on @entity3 with clear skies above three oceans			1
the image , taken on september 8 , shows no hurricanes , cyclones , or tropical storms in the @entity11 , @entity12 , or @entity13 basin			1
a total of 14 polar satellite images , also known as swaths , were stitched together to create the stunning view			1

a total of 14 polar satellite images , also known as swaths , were taken at midday and stitched together to create the stunning view there was plenty of cloud cover , however , and smaller storm systems in view			2
in the eastern @entity12 , remnants of tropical storm @entity29 were breaking up near the @entity30			2
in the eastern @entity11 , the pieces of a tropical depression are seen starting to gather near the islands of @entity34			1
by the next day , tropical storm @entity35 would form			0
the natural - colour images were acquired by the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) on the @entity39 ( @entity41 ) satellite			1
this , however , was an extremely rare day of calm on @entity3			0
last month , the @entity45 @entity44 charted the 11,967 tropical cyclones that have occurred on @entity3 since records began			2

by colouring how many times any storm track overlapped another , certain patterns arise in the density of storms affecting a given area			0
@entity57 tracks overlapped the most in the @entity12 and @entity58			0
the frequency of track overlaps is much lower in the @entity61 the resulting image revealed the world â€™s worst hit areas			0
the frequency of storm overlaps was shown to be much lower in the @entity61 than in the @entity67			0
they also produced a second map showing storm intensity			0
in contrast to the first image of frequency , the @entity71 showed a much greater spread of strong storms , whereas in the @entity12 the strongest cyclones seem to group near the @entity79			1
in its may and august 2013 outlooks , the @entity80 forecasted a 70 per cent chance of a ' more active than normal ' season , with 13 to 20 named storms and 7 to 11 hurricanes .			0

on september 8 the world was *unusually* quiet with no hurricanes , cyclones or tropical storms above three oceans
the image was created by stitching together 14 satellite shots taken by the @entity38
the quiet did *n't* last long . in the eastern @entity11 you can see pieces of a tropical depression starting to gather
