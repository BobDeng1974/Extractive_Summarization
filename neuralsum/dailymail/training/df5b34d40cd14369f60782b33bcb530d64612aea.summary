by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 19:11 est , 11 december 2012 what was the most talked about event of this year ? @entity3 being re-elected ? perhaps it was the @entity5 river pageant ? nope			1
it was , according to @entity7 , @entity9 ’s ‘ dad dancing ’ at the @entity10 of the @entity11			1
the social networking site ’s annual review , published yesterday , revealed the mayor of @entity16 ’s gyrations sparked more posts per second in @entity18 than any other event in 2012 as tv viewers rushed to share their laughter			1
after mr @entity9 ’s dancing the next biggest ‘ spike ’ in @entity18 @entity7 conversation came when @entity37 lost to @entity54 on penalties in the @entity38 quarter - finals , followed by shock from x factor fans when @entity59 , the show ’s eventual winner , and @entity43 ended up in the bottom two , thus facing elimination from the competition			1
overall , the 16 - day @entity11 generated the biggest conversation of the year with 150million tweets across the globe			2
mr @entity3 ’s ‘ four more years ’ comment on his re-election as @entity73 president became the most re-tweeted of 2012 – and the most re-tweeted ever – after it was re-posted by 810,000 people in more than 200 countries			1

what got @entity84 comic : mr @entity87 's chariots of fire sketch at the @entity88 was another @entity90 moment in the top ten most retweeted worldwide : @entity3 's succinct missive to announce his victory in the 2012 election was shared more than any other @entity7 published this year multimedia : @entity97 's tweeting during live shows on @entity100 's @entity99 caused fury among some viewers , but it gave a new dimension to the television broadcast innovative : on the day of the @entity109 premiere in october , author and comedian @entity106 translated the original 12 @entity111 novels into 140 character @entity112 # @entity114 : @entity115 's @entity7 was just one of more than 700,000 sent following footballer @entity118 's heart attack on the pitch in march the review also threw up some surprises			1
the @entity5 is a notable absence among the most discussed topics			0
@entity123 , whose ‘ why women hate me for being beautiful ’ article was published in the @entity132 , is in fifth place in the ‘ issue of the year ’ category , after prince @entity128 ’s deployment to @entity129			0
the @entity133 topped the list			0
the @entity135 was found to be the top ‘ trending ’ sports topic of the year , pushing the @entity11 into fourth place			2
trends on @entity7 reflect the hottest emerging topics , rather than what has been consistently popular over time			2
analysts believe the @entity135 gained first place because people used its full name in @entity112 , whereas many @entity11 posts referred to ‘ the @entity146 ’ or ‘ @entity147 ’ , which could have reduced the statistics for ‘ @entity11 ’			2
@entity26 , who joined @entity7 in october , topped the poll of @entity18 political trends			0
