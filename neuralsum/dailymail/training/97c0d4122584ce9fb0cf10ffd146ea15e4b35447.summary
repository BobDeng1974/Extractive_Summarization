with her big brown eyes and constant need for cuddles and kisses , @entity0 makes every maternal fibre of my being swell			1
every time i look at her - or even a picture of her - my heart fills with immeasurable love and the desire to hold her close , bury my face in hers , protect and cosset her - the normal , all - encompassing feelings of intense love and responsibility that a mother has towards her child			2
but @entity0 is not my daughter			1
she is my four - year - old @entity24 , and i freely admit that i love her as much as i love my 11 - year - old son , @entity25			1
in fact , on some occasions i love her more than him			0
and i do n't feel a bit guilty about admitting that			0
my son spreads mess around the house			2
he has to be chided and reminded to do his homework and put away his clothes , or told off for answering back , while my dear , sweet - natured @entity0 is always obedient , even - tempered and brimming with affection			1
mother 's best friend : @entity39 admits that her dog @entity0 is often higher in her affection than her son everything i do for @entity0 results in love and gratitude			1
every plate of food is gulped down amid much tail - wagging and excitement ; the mere mention of a walk produces yaps of joy and wet doggy kisses			2
by contrast , no matter how many meals i dream up for @entity25 , how many of his clothes i launder or how many times i take him swimming or to after - school clubs , i barely get a word of recognition or thanks			1
before you pick up the phone to the @entity63 , you should know that i 'm not alone in how i feel			0
a recent study revealed that dogs trigger the same parental instincts in adults as their children do			1
dog - owning mums reacted with the same feelings of love and compassion to images of their pet as they did to those of their children			1
it comes as no surprise to me that in one part of the study , where the area of the brain that deals with facial recognition was analysed , the women responded more favourably to pictures of their canine companions than to pictures of their offspring			2
different needs : while @entity0 will always rely on @entity39 , @entity25 is becoming more independent this resonates with me			1
for , much as i love my son - and i do , more than any words could express - i also love @entity0 with the same drive and passion			1
and on occasions , those feelings of love for her do run deeper than those i have for @entity25			1
after all , i 'm on borrowed time with @entity0 in a way i 'm not with my son			1
with her , i have 12 or so years at best			0
i 'm already a third of the way through , so i need to make her every moment as happy as possible			0
i want her never to feel unloved or unwanted			0
obviously , i want my son to feel that way too			2
but as we have decades of fun and shared time left together , i feel that @entity0 's needs now are more pressing			1
there is also the fact that she will always be a baby , while my son is growing up and away from me			1
a puppy brings out that same love that a parent feels for a newborn - a ferocious sense of idolatry combined with a need to protect and treasure			2
but with children that love evolves and becomes more organic , less obsessive			2
it does n't change with a dog because they always need you in exactly the same way			0
@entity121 pooch : sometimes @entity0 gets more attention than @entity25 home hierarchy : the dog believes she 's second in line , then @entity25 the enormous sense of responsibility i feel towards @entity0 has not changed since the day i brought her home			1
i chose to take her from her mother , bring her into my home and make her dependent on me for ever			0
unlike with @entity25 , i am not preparing her for a bigger journey			1
her life begins and ends with me			0
it 's up to me to make her happy			0
after all , is n't that what having a pet is all about ? should n't every responsible owner put their furry companion first ? my role in loving , nurturing and caring for @entity25 is to ready him for the world , to make him a responsible adult and less reliant on me			1
and with each passing day , he is demonstrating that he needs me less and less			0
at 11 and a half , the signs of burgeoning independence are there			0
there is no more hand - holding when we are out , no kisses goodbye if anyone can see			2
the little boy who would spend hours snuggled up to me on the sofa sharing a book , or falling asleep with his head in my lap , is long gone			0
and as a single mother , i have to hand @entity25 over to his father every other weekend , so my relationship with him is punctuated by periods when he is away from me			1
not so with @entity0 , who never leaves my side or suffers from divided loyalties			1
she does n't complain when i nuzzle my head on her belly , stroke her face lovingly or scoop her into my arms			0
pupply love : @entity0 gives affection in abundance she does n't disappear to school every day , or for playdates or football competitions			1
she is there at my side , wherever i am			0
she spends her days in my office under the desk and sleeps in my bed at night			0
if i tell her i have to pop out , she flattens her ears and puts her tail between her legs , and when i return she greets me as if i 've been away for months			0
it is on those occasions - when her face is pressed into my neck , her nose cold and wet against my ear , her love for me palpable - that i really can not imagine loving anyone or anything more			0
i guess a lot of it comes down to a human need to feel wanted and loved , and @entity0 gives that in abundance			1
children , as they grow older , do not give such physical shows of love to their parents			0
the feeling of being the most important person in the world to your child stops the moment they start school and realise that other people can fulfil their basic needs			0
and as they grow up , you fade fast from their thoughts			0
sharing a parent : @entity25 can sometimes get jealous of his mother 's constant canine companion they want you out of the way when their friends are around			1
you are told not to interfere , not to nag			0
and that 's tough for any mum to cope with - which is probably why , as the study bore out , so many women eventually replace their needy kids with needy dogs			1
it is probably why you used to see old ladies pushing dogs around in old prams			0
unlike children , dogs never grow out of the need to be babied			2
more than one in three pet owners say they would cut back on their own food spending ahead of their pet 's naturally , my son can resent the attention i pay @entity0 and her attachment to me			1
he 'll complain that @entity0 's walks take priority over giving him a lift to his friend 's house , or that her need to be fed outweighs his calls for a snack			2
he will become jealous when i tell him that , no , i ca n't get up to look at what he is doing on his computer because @entity0 is asleep on my lap. and no , he ca n't move her off the chair nearest the tv , where he wants to sit			2
this does n't go down well with everyone			0
a relative once berated me when i came home and greeted the dog with kisses and cuddles but forgot to acknowledge my son			0
yet @entity0 plays up to her role of mummy 's girl in a way my child never has , and i just react to it			2
she is jealous of him too			0
on the rare occasions when my now quite strapping son plonks himself next to me on the sofa , @entity0 is there in a flash , sitting between us , one paw placed possessively on my knee			1
if i am styling his hair or helping him with his tie , she presses herself against my legs , needing to be part of the goings - on			0
who does n't get pleasure from feeling wanted and needed , and knowing you are the centre of someone 's world ? being a pack animal , @entity0 observes a hierarchy and , while she knows i am head of that pack , it is obvious that she regards herself as second in line , with @entity25 third			1
in my mind , though , and despite what anyone else might think , based on my love for her and the fulfilment of her needs over anyone else 's , @entity0 will always be first .			2

@entity39 adores her four - year - old @entity24 , @entity0
she admits she sometimes loves her more than her son , @entity25
son is growing up and becoming independent
but @entity0 will always need her and is always affectionate
study found dogs trigger same parental instincts in adults as their children
