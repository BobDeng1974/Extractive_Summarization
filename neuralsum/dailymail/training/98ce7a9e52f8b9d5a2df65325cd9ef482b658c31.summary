by @entity0 there is a plateau in central @entity3 where visitors are few and winters cold and long - lasting			2
south - west of @entity7 , it rises steeply amid pine forests to a bleak and windswept plain , with only a few hamlets and widely scattered farm houses as habitation			2
in the midst of it is the village of @entity16			1
until @entity3 fell in summer 1940 , and @entity18 became part of unoccupied @entity3 , you would hardly have known there was a war on			2
then the refugees started to arrive			1
they were wanted by the @entity23 for various reasons as resisters , communists or @entity27			1
many were @entity27 children who had escaped the round - ups that ended up in their arrested parents taking the fatal train journey to the death camps in the @entity33			1
secret lives : jewish and @entity37 children of one of @entity18 's children 's homes during @entity41 a network of relief organisations was formed whose priority was to save them			1
increasingly they sent them to @entity16 , where they would be billeted in houses or on isolated farms			1
the people of the plateau for the most part were staunchly @entity55			2
they had huguenot traditions of defying persecution			2
they were also close - mouthed and averse to gossip			0
the effect of their austere silent lifestyle frustrated the @entity3 authorities when they decided to raid the plateau looking for @entity27			1
some 50 police and gendarmes from the @entity67 were sent up in trucks and ordered the mayor and the leading pastor , @entity71 , to hand over the names of all jews in the area			1
good deeds never forgotten : the @entity77 in @entity16 @entity71 , a charismatic preacher with a very large following , said he had no idea if any of his parishioners were @entity27 and he would not tell them if they were			1
he was ordered to instruct the @entity27 to come forward			1
instead he told them to disappear			0
next morning in church he told his flock they should ‘ @entity83 rather than man ’			0
the police had their own list of 72 jews and proceeded to search the village , combing cellars and attics			1
so they set out to search the countryside			0
again they found nothing but empty rooms			0
‘ ca n’t think where they ’ve gone , ’ said one pastor in charge of a hostel			0
‘ they were here yesterday			0
’ ‘ yesterday ’ he had taken them all to the forests			0
this game of hide and seek went on for three weeks			0
at night the children were hidden in remote farmhouses in attics , behind wood piles or in cupboards whenever the gendarmes came			2
one farmer asked them : ‘ what do @entity27 look like ? i hear they have big noses			1
’ a list of addresses was mysteriously pinned up in @entity16			1
it was of places which the police planned to visit			2
they also helpfully spent their spare time in the cafes talking loudly about where they planned to go next			0
one englishwoman in the village , miss @entity127 , a @entity37 socialist from @entity129 , ran a home for school children			1
asked by a police lieutenant if she knew of any jews in the area , she demanded why he wanted to know			2
he said if she signed a declaration that there were none , the police would probably be withdrawn			2
the lieutenant sat at her piano and played @entity143 , and told her he would be back ‘ with champagne ’ when the @entity145 won the war			0
hunting refugees : two jewish resistance fighters are arrested by @entity23 troops in @entity151 , 1943 after three weeks , only one @entity27 had been found , an @entity152 who was carried off weeping , but he was soon returned as ‘ insufficiently @entity27 ’			1
all other @entity27 on the list had vanished			1
the prefect of the @entity67 , @entity157 , reported to @entity3 that the police had failed to find any jews on the plateau			2
they had probably fled because it was too cold to survive in the forests			0
it seems probable that @entity157 had allowed advance warning of the search to be given			0
invasion : @entity167 occupied @entity3 as portrayed during the filming of ' @entity169 ' @entity170 is not the first to have written of this remarkable safe enclave , but she has investigated the most thoroughly , tracking down survivors among the protectors and among the children			1
she tells their individual stories in copious detail and they are by no means all sweetness and light			0
many survivors , especially orphaned children , were permanently scarred by their ordeal			2
the most remarkable thing about this rescue of perhaps 800 @entity27 children — plus some 3,000 who passed through @entity187 en route to safety across the @entity191 border — was the scale of the cover - up			1
@entity3 has a notorious record for collaboration and denunciation during the @entity23 occupation			0
there was no shortage of informers in @entity201 or other cities			0
yet on the plateau nobody peached			0
even the local @entity23 army commander was said to have thrown anonymous letters of denunciation into the wastepaper basket			0
imprisonment and torture : @entity211 's secret police , the @entity210 , tortured the villagers to tray and get information proportionate to population , more @entity27 were saved on the plateau centred on @entity187 than anywhere else in @entity3			1
but some rescuers paid a high price			2
several women organisers who rescued @entity27 children ended up in @entity223 concentration camp			1
the popular and reckless local gp , dr @entity225 , was murdered by the @entity23 , while @entity226 , who conducted parties of children to the @entity191 border by night , was caught 200 yards short of it and handed over to the @entity23			1
she was imprisoned and tortured by the @entity210 trying to get information on her colleagues			1
then she was taken with other resistance prisoners to an isolated spot where they were battered to death with spades			1
@entity226 left behind the most haunting poem written about @entity3			1
it read : i shall betray tomorrow , not today			0
today , pull out my fingernails , i shall not betray			0
the file is under the window			0
the file is not for the window bars it is for my wrists			0
today i have nothing to say			0
full of unpleasant and gritty details of life in @entity3 under the @entity23 , this is an inspiring book .			0

during @entity41 thousands of refugees hid in the village of @entity16
despite *harassment* from the police , the villagers never gave @entity27 away
around 800 jewish children and 3,000 others passed safely through @entity187 to the @entity191 border
however , some of the protectors pad the price for their good deed
haunting poem by @entity226 , who was battered to death with spades by the @entity210 when she refused to talk
