by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 10:54 est , 14 august 2013 police are hunting a suspected robber who copied a crime that featured in a storyline of @entity7 hospital drama @entity5			1
it is believed the man they want to question in relation to an incident on august 6 was copying an episode of the popular show called @entity15 , in which robbers leave a doll by the side of the road in a bid to lure victims into a trap			1
@entity23 confirmed it was investigating reports of a man who had been seen lurking in bushes near @entity27 shortly after placing a baby doll by the side of the road			1
drama : the storyline from @entity7 show @entity5 featured a baby doll left at the side of a country lane @entity23 had initially refused to investigate believing it to be an online urban myth that ' surfaces periodically ' , but backtracked when more witnesses came forward			1
the episode , called @entity15 , aired on august 3 , just three days before the force first started receiving reports of a similar real - life crime			2
it features a couple , @entity45 and @entity46 , who are driving along a country road when they spot what they think is a real baby abandoned on the verge in a car seat			1
when @entity45 gets out to check the baby is all right - only to find it is a child 's toy - he is set upon by three men wearing sackcloths over their faces			2
as two of the thugs beat him up , one of them approaches @entity46 , who is still in the car , and smashes her window before grabbing her handbag			2
she drives at the robber , knocking him over before swerving and plunging down a hill			0
on august 6 , motorists reported to police that they had seen a man ' lurking in the bushes ' by a roundabout in @entity75 in @entity76 , after first placing a doll by the side of the road			1
attack : in the episode , called @entity15 , one of the victims is set upon after stopping the car to help several witnesses stated online that the scam was ' similar to the storyline in casualty ' aired three days earlier			1
one , with the username gcunningham212 , wrote : ' this is exactly the same as what happened on @entity5			0
' robbers lie in wait for someone to stop and check on the baby and then attack them			2
' although the matter was reported to police that day , the force has admitted it originally dismissed the matter as an online urban myth which ' surfaces periodically '			1
but after more witnesses came forward , the force backtracked and said it was now taking the incident seriously			2
a spokeswoman said : ' unfortunately , this report coincided with a recent response we made to the hoax ' baby seat in road ' scam which has been doing the rounds for several years			0
' however , this report is being taken seriously			0
' copycat : after being attacked , the woman in the car drives at one of the robbers , before crashing off the road the online warning is usually sent by email or posted on social networking , sites such as @entity121 , and sent to millions of people around the world about not stopping when they see a car seat with a baby in it			1
it states : ' while driving on any roads , if you see a baby car seat sitting on the side of the road , do not stop , this could be a gang 's trap			0
' they target people especially women , to stop their vehicle to help a baby			0
they make this baby look as if it has blood on itself or on its clothes			0
' when you exit from your vehicle in attempt to help , the gangs jump out - they have beaten women to near death , and then rape them			0
' their goal is to torture the victims to death in any way possible			0
if you do happen to see a car seat , do not stop , call police immediately			2
' please forward this message to everyone you know			0
' the message has been viewed by millions around the world , with police forces regularly having to issue statements denying the events are taking place			0
scene : police are investigating after receiving of an incident near @entity27 that bares striking similarities to @entity5 's storyline			1
