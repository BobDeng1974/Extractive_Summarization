president @entity0 is getting off the island			1
in a rare move for him , the president planned a break in the middle of his @entity7 vacation to return to @entity8 on sunday night for meetings with vice president @entity10 and other advisers on the @entity13 military campaign in @entity14 and tensions between police and protesters in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the @entity20 has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in @entity8 for those discussions			1
he 's received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation			0
the @entity20 had also already announced @entity0 's plans to return to @entity8 before the @entity13 airstrikes in @entity14 began and before the shooting of a teen in @entity18 that sparked protests			1
protective gesture : @entity0 walks with daughter @entity33 to board @entity34 at @entity35 in @entity36 on sunday back home : @entity0 and @entity33 are seen at @entity38 in @entity8 early monday mysterious : the @entity20 has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in @entity8			1
he is seen here on the @entity42 of the @entity20 with daughter @entity33 in good spirits : despite the early return , the president and @entity46 seemed to be enjoying a joke part of the decision to head back to @entity8 appears aimed at countering criticism that @entity0 is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises			1
yet those crises turned the first week of @entity0 's vacation into a working holiday			1
he made on - camera statements @entity14 and the clashes in @entity18 , a @entity61 suburb			2
he also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between @entity64 and @entity65 , as well as between @entity66 and @entity67			0
' i think it 's fair to say there are , of course , ongoing complicated situations in the world , and that 's why you 've seen the president stay engaged , ' @entity20 spokesman @entity68 said			1
@entity0 returned from his break along with his 16 - year - old daughter @entity79 , but is scheduled to return to @entity7 on tuesday and stay through next weekend			2
in a first for @entity0 family summer vacations , neither teenager is spending the entire holiday with her father			1
@entity0 left @entity8 aug. 9 with his wife , @entity85 , daughter @entity33 , and the family 's two @entity87 water dogs			2
the @entity20 said 13 - year - old @entity89 would join her parents at a later date for " part of their stay " on this quaint island of shingled homes			1
but @entity33 will not be around when her younger sister arrives			0
the daughters essentially are trading places , and the vacation is boiling down to @entity0 getting about a week with each one			0
@entity33 returned to @entity8 with her father and is not expected to go back to @entity7			0
the @entity20 said @entity89 will join her parents this week , without saying when she will arrive or what kept her away last week , or why @entity33 left the island			1
president @entity0 bike rides with daughter @entity33 while on vacation with his family on the island of @entity7 @entity0 often draws chuckles from sympathetic parents who understand his complaints about his girls ' lack of interest in spending time with him			1
' what i 'm discovering is that each year , i get more excited about spending time with them			0
they get a little less excited , ' @entity0 told @entity118 last year			0
even though work has occupied much of @entity0 's first week on vacation , he still found plenty of time to golf , go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island			2
he hit the golf course one more time sunday ahead of his departure , joining two aides and former @entity132 player @entity131 for an afternoon round			0
he then joined wife @entity85 for an evening jazz performance featuring singer @entity135			0
@entity0 's vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics			0
he headlined a fundraiser on the island for @entity143 @entity142 candidates and attended a birthday party for @entity143 adviser @entity146 's wife , where he spent time with former president @entity147 and @entity148			0
that get - together between the former rivals - turned - partners added another complicated dynamic to @entity0 's vacation			0
just as @entity0 was arriving on @entity7 , an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of @entity0 's foreign policy			2
@entity147 later promised she and @entity0 would ' hug it out ' when they saw each other at @entity146 's party			0
no reporters were allowed in , so it 's not clear whether there was any hugging , but the @entity20 said the president danced to nearly every song .			2

president @entity0 will head back to the @entity20 on sunday night as tensions rise in @entity19 and @entity14
the decision appears aimed at countering criticism that the president was spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many crises
