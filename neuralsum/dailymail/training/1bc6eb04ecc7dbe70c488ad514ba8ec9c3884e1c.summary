by @entity1 reporter most people would admit to ' dressing down ' when they nip to the shops to buy a quick snack			0
but one young woman in @entity6 took that quite literally and walked into a garage completely naked to buy her lunch			1
customer @entity9 , 34 , filmed the startling moment on his mobile phone and said he had been filling his car petrol when he saw the young woman walking towards the garage in @entity15			1
he said : ' i went inside to tell staff but the woman seemed to think i was mad and ignored me , and then i realised she was coming into pay so i grabbed my mobile phone			1
' she completely ignored me and she did n't seem drunk or on drugs , she just stood patiently waiting in the queue to be served so that she could pay for her drink and a sandwich			1
' she did n't seem drunk or on drugs , ' said mr @entity9 who was shocked by the display ' the sales assistant served as if nothing was happening , and the blokes in the petrol station be much ignored her , they did n't even sneak a crafty look			2
it was a really surreal experience , ' he said ' it was pretty hot , i reckon it was well over 30 degrees outside , but what surprised me most was not so much the nudity as the way everybody treated it is perfectly normal			0
