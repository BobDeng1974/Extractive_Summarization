a notorious police killer has received more than £ 250,000 in legal aid , helping him to launch a string of ‘ absurd ’ human rights cases from jail			1
@entity5 , 48 , used part of the taxpayer - funded sum to sue the prison service on four occasions – even claiming that he should be moved to a more comfortable cell			1
last night the legal cost racked up by the killer was criticised as ‘ ludicrous ’ by the widow of pc @entity15 , the officer he shot at point blank range on @entity19 in 2003			1
speaking from her home in @entity21 , she said : ‘ it is absolutely disgraceful that someone like him is allowed that amount of public money			1
@entity5 ( pictured left ) shot pc @entity15 ( right ) dead at point blank range on @entity19 , 2003 ‘ i genuinely do n’t understand why after 11 years this is still going on			1
’ @entity5 , a former @entity30 , racked up a £ 277,600 bill at the taxpayer ’s expense , according to figures released by the @entity35			2
but officials say the total amount claimed by @entity5 may increase even further as he is involved in on - going legal proceedings			0
figures , revealed following a freedom of information request , show the majority of @entity5 ’s legal aid – £ 236,620 – was spent on his crown court trial			1
the rest , more than £ 40,000 , was spent on civil claims about his prison conditions			2
he acquired some £ 23,782 in aid for pre-court legal work , while a @entity51 application for a judicial review cost £ 16,775.04 of public money			0
another case that reached court used £ 420 in legal aid			0
the size of the bill will once again raise questions about the ease with which dangerous criminals can access public funds , despite government reforms to cut the bloated legal aid budget			0
@entity5 was given a ‘ whole life ’ sentence – later cut to 37 years – in 2004 following the murder of @entity68 , 34 , who was shot in the chest and head after stopping the killer ’s vehicle in @entity73			2

@entity5 attempted to have his security category downgraded so he could be moved to a better cell at @entity89 ( pictured ) in @entity90 traffic policeman @entity15 , pictured left with his wife @entity93 on their honeymoon in @entity96 , september 2001 , was killed outside a betting shop in @entity73 while on duty but he demanded to have his ‘ exceptional risk ’ security category downgraded so he could be moved to a better cell at high - security @entity89 in @entity90			1
he claimed his human rights were infringed			1
mr @entity105 , speaking during @entity5 ’s @entity51 hearing last year , described his crimes as ‘ bestial ’ and said his claim was ‘ untenable ’ and ‘ absurd ’			2
‘ @entity5 has made numerous applications to the @entity51 about the conditions in which he is being held , ’ he said			0
‘ all the claims have been funded by legal aid			0
‘ it is perhaps noteworthy that i have sat in this court , where i usually sit , with litigants in person before me – people who are desperate to see their children – from whom the government has withdrawn all legal aid			0
’ @entity5 ’s legal team yesterday disputed claims that he funded all of his claims with public money as ‘ factually wrong ’ , claiming he paid for one hearing himself			0
justice secretary @entity124 said : ‘ it is cases just like this – where a convicted killer has used taxpayers ’ money on speculative court cases to try and challenge their prison status – that made me determined to make big changes to the system			2
‘ we have now changed the rules to ensure legal aid resources are only available when really necessary			0
