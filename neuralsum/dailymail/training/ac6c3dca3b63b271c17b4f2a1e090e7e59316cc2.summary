@entity2 's entire @entity1 government was dissolved yesterday as president @entity3 desperately fought to assert authority in the face of economic crisis			1
the upheaval comes as a key minister launched a rebellion by claiming the president is leading @entity2 to ‘ catastrophe ’ by seeking to make cuts ‘ on @entity14 orders ’			1
left - wing economy minister @entity15 defied mr @entity3 ’s authority by publicly urging him to discard austerity and break with what he described as deficit - cutting measures imposed on the eurozone by ‘ the most extreme orthodoxy of the @entity22 ’			1
@entity3 asked @entity25 to form a new government , which will be presented on tuesday earlier this month @entity14 president @entity32 had rejected calls from mr @entity3 to soften eurozone deficit targets that @entity2 had failed to meet			1
as his party was plunged into civil war , mr @entity3 yesterday called on @entity25 , his prime minister , to form a new cabinet ‘ consistent with the direction he has set for the country ’			1
the head of state ’s approval rating has plunged to 17 per cent – by far the lowest in the history of modern @entity2			0
it follows a disastrous two years in power , which has seen the @entity2 economy stagnant for the past six months , and unemployment is running at more than 10 per cent			2
mr @entity51 ’s government has been in power for only five months			2
the value of the euro against the @entity57 dollar slumped yesterday following the upheaval in @entity2			0
as @entity3 dissolved his government , the euro fell to 1.3185 against the dollar , its lowest level since september 2013			1
in @entity63 , the stock exchange was closed for the @entity64			0
when it closed on friday the pound was at 1.25 against the euro			0
@entity2 , dubbed the ‘ sick man of @entity67 ’ , has seen its economy grind to a halt , registering two consecutive quarters of no growth			2
the value of the single currency has also been eroded by weak confidence that the eurozone economies can eke out growth			0
figures last week showed there was zero growth for the 18 - country bloc in the three months to the end of june			0
senior @entity85 official @entity84 said @entity67 ’s economy was ‘ dead in the water ’			2
the last one , under @entity89 , was dissolved in march after the disastrous performance of the @entity91 in local elections			0
two ministers , mr @entity94 and education secretary @entity96 , have publicly criticised the direction in which mr @entity3 ’s hapless administration is heading			1
mr @entity15 , 51 , said forcibly slashing deficits was ‘ economic madness ’			0
he also attacked @entity14 , saying it should not be allowed to ‘ push around ’ his country			0
he told @entity103 newspaper : ‘ the priority must be the existing crisis and the dogmatic reduction of deficits should come second			0
’ mr @entity96 was similarly scathing towards mr @entity3 , effectively saying he supported the rebellion launched by mr @entity15			1
justice minister @entity108 meanwhile sent a message to the two rebels saying ‘ bravo ’ for speaking out			2
culture minister @entity112 also tweeted her greetings to the two ministers in a veiled show of support – which forced her resignation before tomorrow ’s reshuffle			1
@entity121 pm @entity120 ( right ) and @entity14 chancellor @entity32 ( left ) walk the last part of the way of @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126 , northwestern @entity121 on sunday as they talk about @entity67			0
@entity2 economic minister @entity15 attacked @entity14 for ' pushing @entity2 around ' new start : @entity3 's office said in a statement a new government would be formed by @entity132 ( right ) on tuesday in line with the ' direction he ( the president ) has defined for our country ' president @entity3 has ignored two years of dissent from mr @entity94 in the interests of holding together his divided party			1
but mr @entity25 is understood to have threatened to resign if mr @entity3 had failed to act , accusing mr @entity15 of crossing ‘ a yellow line ’ as he announced the cabinet ’s resignation			1
but the economy minister told a news conference yesterday that he had to speak out to try to avert the @entity147 ’s ‘ descent into hell ’			1
he said : ‘ i informed the prime minister ... that if he deemed my convictions counter to the direction of the government he leads , then in that case i thought it necessary for me to be let go			1
’ both mr @entity3 and mr @entity25 believe the key to success is their so - called @entity157 , which offers businesses tax breaks in exchange for creating jobs			1
but the left wing of the ruling @entity91 is furious over this shift to centrist economic @entity166 crisis comes on the day @entity29 was meant to be focusing on the 70th anniversary of its liberation from @entity171 rule during the @entity172			0
as his political fortunes plummeted , mr @entity3 cut a sorry figure as he made an open air speech in pouring rain on the @entity177 , off the coast of @entity179			1
soaked , and with his glasses steamed up , he read from a prepared script about @entity2 ’s wartime history , without once referring to his government ’s dissolution why has @entity1 prime minister resigned along with his entire government ? senior cabinet members , including economy minister @entity15 , are in open revolt at the austerity drive imposed on @entity2 by @entity67 , and sanctioned by president @entity3			1
they say it is has stifled economic growth , and caused unemployment to rocket to above 3.3 million			0
they also believe that economic woes are leading to the success of extremist parties , such as the @entity198 , who won 26 % of the popular vote in @entity67 elections in may			0
what happens next ? a new government will be formally appointed by mr @entity25 , in consultation with mr @entity3 , on tuesday			1
it is likely to be a ‘ compromise ’ government , aimed at uniting left - wingers with more centrist cabinet members , while allowing the prime minister and president to continue with their economic policies			1
what is wrong with @entity2 's economy ? critics argue that just over two years of @entity1 administration has plunged it into chaos			2
mr @entity3 came to power as a tax - and - spend left winger who admitted to disliking the rich			2
a top rate of income tax of 75 % was among measures which caused wealth creators to flee the country , along with wealthy celebrities			0
mr @entity3 has adopted a more moderate stance in recent months , but there has been zero economic growth this year , as unemployment rises along with the cost of living			2
will a new government fix it ? commentators fear that a new @entity1 government – one which will amount to the third this year alone – will simply lead to more failure			0
mr @entity3 is a notoriously indecisive leader who does everything possible to keep everybody happy , at the expense of getting anything positive done			2
mr @entity15 is likely to lead further challenges to the authority of mr @entity3 and mr @entity25 , along with numerous allies on the left of the @entity91			1
a party at war is unlikely to sort out @entity2 ’s chronic economic problems			0
does the @entity2 crisis affect other countries in @entity67 ? yes – @entity2 ’s decline within the @entity147 project is having huge repercussions across the @entity258 , not least of all on near - neighbours such as the @entity261			0
global economies are all interlinked , with economic experts frequently warning that a ‘ sick man ’ @entity2 will pull all others down with it			0
this could mean disaster for the @entity147 .			0
