he told @entity48 's @entity47 : ' i think after toppling @entity45 , while no one is questioning that he was a dictator , we as an international community , especially those that intervened militarily , did not put enough resources ( in ) for developing a modern , democratic , @entity6 state			1
' i think we should have done more , the @entity56 should have been more involved			0
' he also called for the lifting of the @entity56 arms embargo on the @entity6 government to help it fight terrorism			0

bombing : it was @entity8 's first official military action in @entity6 since the overthrow of @entity45 in 2011 retaliation : @entity8 blitzed @entity83 training camps , weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured @entity8 workers in a video ( above ) released on sunday interior minister @entity91 insisted the @entity11 state was an ' absolute priority ' , warning there was ' not a minute to lose '			1
@entity83 , which wants to include @entity25 as part of its so - called @entity96 , now controls a number of ports and there are fears that fighters could be on boats bound for southern @entity77			0

' @entity0 is giving @entity6 support through our aid budget			0
we did a major training project for the @entity6 security forces			0
we are doing work to try and bring together a national unity government in @entity6			0
' but of course what we face in @entity6 is a very difficult situation with far too many armed militias , without a proper government and with the growth of ungoverned space , and we 've had the appalling events of the last few days with the brutal , senseless murders of @entity127 on the beach , which i know has shocked the whole world			0
' i discussed it yesterday with the president of @entity8 and what the whole world needs to do is come together and work for a @entity6 that has a national unity government , obviously excluding terrorists , and that can start to build the institutions of a state			0
' do i regret that @entity0 played our role in getting rid of @entity45 and coming to the aid of that nation when @entity45 was going to murder his own citizens in @entity175 ? no i do n't			0
' it was the right thing for @entity0 to do			0
@entity45 was no friend of our country - the @entity45 given to the @entity178 has done a huge amount of damage in our country			0
