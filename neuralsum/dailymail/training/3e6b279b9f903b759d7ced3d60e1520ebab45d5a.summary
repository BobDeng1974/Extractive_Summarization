a mesmerising pair of identical twin sisters - cabaret queens more famous for their stunning looks than their talent			2
in many ways , @entity9 and @entity10 - better known as @entity11 and @entity12 - were the first people in the world who were famous simply for being famous			1
the @entity12 : @entity12 and @entity11 - originally @entity16 and @entity17 - wearing the costumes of showgirls with ostrich feather headdresses , sitting on a low dresser , holding hands , in a dance revue in @entity24 in 1923 and now a stunning @entity26 sculpture remembering the fabulous ' @entity12 ' - whose allure was the downfall of many a rich man , including @entity31 , founder of @entity32 - is expected to fetch £ 200,000 at auction next month			1

historical figures : the @entity45 sculpture , left expected to fetch £ 200,000 at auction next month , and @entity31 , right , who lost most of his £ 2million fortune thanks to an obsession with the twins they perfected a single - sex ' tandem ' dance act under the name ' the @entity12 ' and were making money performing it in beer halls as early as 1907			1
but the act itself did n't really matter			0
@entity11 and @entity12 were pouting , purring , mirror - image dolls for whom audiences went wild			1
their lack of actual talent was remarked upon , but no one cared - they were stunning creatures who combined an air of innocence with a seductive , racy , wild side			2
the stunning ivory and bronze @entity26 sculpture being auctioned in @entity72 next month pays tribute to their beauty			2
made in 1925 by @entity78 - born @entity77 , it is expected to fetch up to £ 200,000 at @entity79 in @entity72 on 14 november			0
tandem twins : @entity12 and @entity81 were born in @entity34 , @entity82 in 1892 , and made their name in vaudeville before touring the world with their ' tandem ' dance act in the @entity89 , writer @entity88 says : ' in the @entity91 the @entity12 were celebrities on a scale that dwarfed most movie stars , plutocrats and princes , yet today not one person in 1,000 could tell you who they were			1
' @entity99 were stunningly good looking			0
their straight but delicate noses , wide - set eyes and rosebud mouths gave them a seductive air of innocence while their dark eyes and skin suggested depths of gypsy wildness			0
' slight and trim but full - breasted , they were obviously a terrific turn - on for men when they danced together			0
' fit for royalty : men fell at the feet of the twins , and when they arrived in @entity72 in the @entity91 they danced for @entity118 and prince @entity119 , the youngest sons of @entity121 thanks to their looks , their vibrant personalities , and the simple fact that there were two of them , men all over the world were smitten , and they managed to climb from the vaudeville stage to the heights of @entity133 as cabaret dancing act			2
with a penchant for feathers , a knack for dressing identically whether on stage or off , and a routine they perfected by practicing in front of the mirror , the sisters created a dynamic , intriguing , seductive package that men could not resist			0
men fell at their feet , and when they arrived in @entity72 in the @entity91 they danced for @entity118 and prince @entity119 , the youngest sons of @entity121 they both married and divorced very young , and soon after became the object of many a devoted admirer , including @entity31 , founder of @entity32 department store in @entity72 , who became obsessed with them			1
smitten : thanks to their looks , their vibrant personalities , and the simple fact that there were two of them , men all over the world were in their thrall can you tell us apart : the girls always dressed identically , whether on stage or off at 67 he was twice @entity11 's age when he fell in love with her , but that did n't stop him purchasing t her a chateau in @entity166 and proposed marriage every week - never receiving the answer for which he dreamed			2
@entity31 showered the twins with gifts , money and jewels in hope of winning their true affections , and even more so when they developed serious gambling addictions			0
he paid off their debts with his fortune , and by 1931 was close to bankruptcy after they had whittled away his £ 2million estate			0
but the @entity182 proved to be their downfall			0
the free money dried up and in 1933 @entity11 was involved in a near - fatal car crash that destroyed her looks forever and led her to suicide in 1941			1
her sister @entity12 attempted unsuccessfully to follow her in 1962 , eventually succumbing to heart failure in 1970			1
the pair had never been able to accept that celebrity can be fleeting			0
fancy footwork : a love of feathers was one of the @entity12 ' most distinctive calling cards @entity197 : the @entity12 stole the heart of @entity31 , and then bankrupted him with their gambling addiction			1

@entity9 and @entity201 born in @entity34 , @entity82 , in 1892
