by @entity0 a legendary 83 - year - old jewelry thief has been sent back to prison after her latest heist			2
@entity4 has gained a reputation for her knack of walking out of jewelry stores across the globe with million - dollar baubles and her latest theft shows that the octogenarian is still able to pull off a steal			1
unfortunately for @entity4 , authorities are so familiar with her history at this point that they were quick to catch her			1
paying for her crimes : @entity4 has been caught a number of times ( pictured here in 2005 ) for her jewelry thefts but it has n't stopped her from continuing to walk out of stores with millions in diamonds last fall , she had just been released from prison three months earlier when she stole a $ 22,500 diamond and white gold ring from a @entity29 , @entity28 jewelry store			1
she got away with the theft by doing her typical move - trying on jewelry and chatting with the shop owner until they forget she is wearing it as she walks out			0
icon of sorts : @entity4 , now 83 , has been the subject of a documentary and a movie about her life - rumored to be starring @entity40 - is reportedly in the works in this case , the @entity42 reports that the manager of @entity45 only realized that the ring was missing hours after she had gone			1
she sold the ring to a nearby pawnshop for $ 800 , and as part of the sale , she had to give her thumbprint , which eventually tipped off authorities			1
@entity4 was sentenced today to spend two years in jail and two years under mandatory supervision			1
' the judge tempered punishment with compassion about her age , ' @entity4 's attorney @entity55 told the newspaper			2
' he took into account the taxpayers ' pocketbook			0
and do we really need to incarcerate a nonviolent offender - yes , a repeat offender , that 's true - who 's ill , who has emphysema , who 's elderly ? ' @entity4 has been working her cons for more than five decades and has been the subject of a documentary , titled ' @entity76 '			1
there is speculation that a biopic is in the works with @entity82 winner @entity40 set to star as @entity4			2
in the documentary , @entity4 revealed how she first learned the distraction trick as a teenager when a store clerk eagerly ditched her when a white customer came into the store			2
from there , she worked her way up from bargain jewelry to some expensive stores across the globe , with a heist in @entity94 listed as one of her most storied accomplishments			0
over time , she has been connected to 20 aliases , nine dates of birth , and five @entity101 numbers			0
' there ’s never been a day that i went to steal that i did not get what i went to do , ' she said in the documentary			0
all a ruse : over time , she has been connected to 20 aliases , nine dates of birth , and five social security numbers ( @entity4 pictured in a @entity111 courtroom in 2005 ) ' i do n’t have any regrets about stealing jewelry			1
' that sentiment proves problematic for judges who she is put in front of			0
in 2010 , she asked the judge to be lenient because she was ' truly sorry that this went on as long as it did , ' but that was n't enough			0
' you wo n't stop , ' judge @entity123 said at the time , explaining his decision to sentence her to five years which was at the high end of the possible verdicts			2
' that ’s the problem here ... she ’s a thief			0
@entity133 ’s wife , that ’s who she is			0
