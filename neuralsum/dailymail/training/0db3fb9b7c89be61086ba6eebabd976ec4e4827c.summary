@entity0 : @entity2 frontbencher is set for a @entity4 role if @entity5 wins the election in may @entity7 yesterday distanced himself from remarks by a @entity9 mp who questioned a @entity2 frontbencher 's plan to go on maternity leave straight after the election			1
@entity0 hopes to become @entity13 if @entity5 wins power in may , but is due to have her second baby just five weeks later			1
she said at the weekend that she would begin maternity leave shortly before her baby is due and stay away from work until september			2
that prompted @entity9 mp for @entity20 @entity19 to say : ' i do n't want to say someone who is having a baby is not eligible to be a cabinet minister , but i certainly think perhaps the demands of that particular job will require someone to give it their full attention			1
' i do n't expect @entity0 to be in the @entity4 after the election because i expect the @entity9 to win , but clearly people need to be put in the positions they can handle			1
' yesterday , however , when asked whether the prime minister believed a pregnant woman could serve in the @entity4 , mr @entity7 's official spokesman replied : ' why on @entity36 not ? ' he added : ' the prime minister 's views around maternity leave ( entitlements ) is that they are universal , they apply to everyone and it is entirely a matter for individual families to take the decisions that they think are right for them , and the government 's job is to support them in those decisions they take			1
' despite mr @entity7 's support , @entity50 last night accused the conservatives of having a ' women problem '			1
she wrote on @entity54 : ' 300,000 women a year take maternity leave but @ @entity57 thinks ca n't do big job & be a mum			2
@entity9 women problem ? ' the election @entity50 , 36 , hopes will propel her into the @entity4 is on may 7 , and she is due to have her second child on june 15			1
she has said she believes she will have time before she goes on maternity leave to abolish the so - called bedroom tax â€“ the reduction of benefits for claimants in social housing who are deemed to have more living space than they require , which ministers refer to as ending a ' spare room subsidy '			0
miss @entity0 said : ' i 'm having a child and i shall be on maternity leave for the early weeks and months of the next government			1
miss @entity0 took to @entity54 to hit back at criticism of the idea of taking maternity leave from the @entity4 ' the first thing i would do is abolish the bedroom tax			2
that 's something i can do really quickly			0
my baby 's due in june and i want to cancel the bedroom tax before i go on maternity leave			2
' @entity85 , the @entity86 minister for employment relations , yesterday joined the criticism of mr @entity19			2
she said : ' the suggestion that a woman should be turned down for a job because she is pregnant is clearly outrageous			0
' that kind of discrimination would be illegal under employment law and is an appalling attack on the right of pregnant women to take on high - profile leadership roles in government or business			0
it echoes the outdated sexist view that women ca n't be good mothers and also good at their jobs			0
' @entity7 ( left ) distanced himself from remarks by @entity9 mp @entity19 who questioned whether @entity50 could give the job her full attention mr @entity19 was last night unavailable for comment			1
miss @entity0 , who is married to civil servant @entity110 , does not have a nanny or any formal childcare and relies mainly on her mother and aunt			0
she took five months ' maternity leave from @entity116 after her first child was born in march 2013			0
during the election campaign she is expected to be one of @entity2 's most prominent public faces with regular tv appearances			1
she has been pushed forward by @entity5 , becoming shadow chief secretary to the treasury in 2011 before being promoted to shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013			0
but she insisted last night that she does not want to become @entity2 leader , telling @entity127 radio : ' i see the sacrifices my leader @entity5 makes and the toll i think it must place on family life			0
it 's not something that i want to do			0

@entity0 hopes to be @entity13 if @entity2 wins
but she is due to have her second baby just five weeks after the election
@entity9 mp questioned whether she would be able to give job full attention
@entity7 has distanced himself from @entity19 's comments
despite this @entity50 accused @entity146 of having a ' women problem '
