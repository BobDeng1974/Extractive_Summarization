last week @entity14 , which is 82 per cent owned by taxpayers , announced it was paying bonuses totalling £ 600million – despite posting losses of £ 5.2billion			1
@entity18 caused controversy by praising the bank for its ‘ responsibility and restraint ’			2

that is just short of the bank ’s record haul of £ 15.9billion in 2007 and would be the biggest profit by a @entity33 bank since the global financial crisis			1
mr @entity2 ’s bumper payout comes just months after the bank was slapped with a £ 1.25billion fine by @entity38 regulators following accusations it laundered billions of pounds for rogue states and drug cartels through its @entity38 division			1
@entity6 was accused by the @entity44 of fostering a ‘ polluted culture ’ , ignoring warnings and breaching safeguards that could have prevented the laundering of money from @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
@entity54 - based banker @entity53 , head of @entity6 ’s compliance division , which is meant to prevent breaches of the law , sensationally quit in front of the @entity44 committee			0

mr @entity2 would have been entitled to a total package worth £ 12.5million , including long - term share awards , but is likely to receive about half that sum			2
his bonus of £ 2million , which compares with £ 2.1million last year , will be deferred and subject to possible ‘ clawback ’ , where he will not be able to cash it in until he retires from or leaves @entity6			1
@entity73 , of the @entity75 think - tank , said : ‘ banks should get their own house in order and ensure the internal culture has changed so that wrongdoing is stamped out before they think about paying bonuses of any kind to those in charge			0
@entity6 clearly presided over a culture in the @entity38 with scant regard for the rules and little respect for compliance			0
performance : mr @entity2 's handout is reward for @entity6 notching up pre-tax profits of around £ 15.6billion , according to @entity27 estimates			1
pictured is the bank 's headquarters , in @entity99 , @entity54 ‘ the buck for that has to stop at the chief executive ’s door and if there is no penalty , what ’s to stop it happening again			1
’ despite being based in @entity99 , @entity6 makes an estimated 90 per cent of its money outside @entity33 and has benefited from its presence in emerging markets in @entity110			1
since taking over as chief executive in 2011 mr @entity2 has led an overhaul of the bank ’s operations			0
he has cut about 10 per cent of its workforce and pulled out from 46 countries , as well as sold off a number of general insurance businesses			0

on tuesday @entity54 - based @entity140 is also expected to cut its total bonus pot and the payout for its chief executive , @entity143			0
despite a record trading year , the bank was also hit by a @entity38 regulatory probe into its dealings with @entity49			0
