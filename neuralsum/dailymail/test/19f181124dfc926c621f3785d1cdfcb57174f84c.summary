four tries and a total of 30 points from goalkicking winger @entity3 broke brave @entity5 's hearts as @entity6 avoided a potential @entity8 banana skin with a 50 - 30 victory at the @entity10			1
rovers twice came came from behind , trailing 12 - 0 in the early stages to the @entity14 heavyweights , before easing clear with five tries in the final 18 minutes			1
amid a pulsating and sometimes controversial cup tie , the hosts ultimately had no answer to @entity20 international @entity19 , whose last three tries came within the space of seven decisive minutes			0
it was only the @entity26 side 's second cup tie success since reaching the quarter - finals in 2011 and their first @entity8 victory at @entity5 since 1926 , albeit only the third time the clubs had met in the competition since then			1
winger @entity3 scored four tries and kicked 14 points for @entity6 against @entity5 having forced several errors from the @entity38 side in the opening exchanges , it took a fired - up @entity5 less than six minutes to go ahead as @entity40 barged his way through and under the posts			1
@entity43 converted on his way to a tally of five goals			0
the @entity5 struck again when @entity40 and @entity47 put @entity48 over , although @entity43 got a fortuitous bounce off the upright in adding the extras this time			2
rovers bounced back , capitalising on an unforced error from @entity43 to halve the early deficit when winger @entity3 dived over in the corner then converted his own try			1
rovers lost forward @entity59 to a clash of heads midway through the half but they levelled when an @entity64 cross-field kick was tapped back by @entity3 for @entity65 to touchdown with @entity3 again stroking over the extras			1
a scintillating weaving solo run by @entity64 gave the visitors the led for the first time and @entity3 's conversion sent the @entity71 in at half time with an 18 - 12 advantage			1
a minute before the interval the temperature was cranked up a notch when , out of the blue , @entity58 @entity77 launched a blatant punch at @entity40 and was sin - binned , along with the @entity5 @entity80 , who also gained a yellow card after following in with his version of justice			2
less than a minute into the second half the @entity5 gave notice that they were not finished when @entity87 completed a stirring break from @entity89 to score and @entity43 levelled matters			0
the home joy was short - lived as @entity92 broke clear , only to be stopped by a superb tackle from @entity47 , but @entity94 then strode through the regrouping defence to edge rovers in front again			0
@entity3 's kick bounced back off of the upright and @entity5 nearly responded when @entity47 crossed but the final pass was deemed forward			1
@entity80 and @entity100 went close and @entity40 was held up before the home crowd were up in arms again as @entity103 stole the ball from @entity100 in what looked to many like a two - man tackle and ran unopposed over 25 metres to score a controversial try			0
still the @entity5 were not finished as @entity40 put @entity109 in for his 11th try of the season and @entity43 closed the gap to just four points again			0
three minutes later @entity114 crashed over after innovative work from @entity116 , @entity100 and @entity109 and @entity43 edged @entity5 back in front			2
but three tries , all from @entity19 , in seven minutes finally quashed the brave @entity5 ' hopes of an upset			2
controversy reined once more as @entity3 gave @entity58 the lead again , amid vociferous calls for a forward pass , but there was no doubt when the @entity20 international raced away for his hat - trick after @entity43 fatally allowed a bomb - kick to bounce			0
@entity3 struck once more before @entity129 helped raise the half century for @entity58 on the hooter .			0
