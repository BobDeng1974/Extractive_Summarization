by @entity1 reporter savvy supermarket shoppers often buy in bulk in order to get the best deal			0
but larger ‘ value packs ’ may not always beat smaller ones on price , according to a study by the website canieatit.co.uk			2
it found that @entity13 customers buying two boxes of six @entity15 at £ 1.98 each , rather than a large box of ten at £ 3.49 , were paying 33p per egg instead of 35p			2
discrepancy : the study found that six - packs of @entity15 in @entity13 , and 70cl bottles of @entity23 's gin in @entity24 , were better value than larger containers of the same product and a litre of @entity23 ’s @entity29 at @entity24 cost £ 21.29 or £ 2.13 per 100ml , which is more expensive than a 70cl bottle costing £ 13.00 , or £ 1.85 per 100ml			1
website founder @entity31 said : ‘ supermarkets know shoppers automatically grab bigger packs , so when they feel they can get away with it they make them the most expensive			1
’ last year a survey revealed that supermarkets were selling wine for artificially high prices in order to make discounts seem more appealing			0
one store marketed a pinot grigio as ‘ 33 per cent off ’ , when it had only been sold at the higher price for 16 days in the year .			0

a study by canieatit.co.uk found that sometimes smaller packs beat larger
happy eggs in @entity13 and @entity51 in @entity24 were *cheaper* smaller
website founder said supermarkets ' feel the can get away with ' the *unusual* pricing because shoppers automatically pick up the largest packs
