by @entity0 the @entity1 was recently believed to have a mass three trillion times bigger than that of our sun. but now scientists have discovered that our @entity1 is lighter than previously thought - with just 800 billion solar masses			1
this means it has about half the mass of one of its closest neighbours , the @entity15 , 2.5 million light years away			1
the @entity1 is seen here above the dome of the @entity18 1.54 - metre telescope at @entity19 in @entity20			0
scientists have discovered that the @entity1 , the galaxy containing the sun and its family of planets , is lighter than was previously thought both are similar types of spiral galaxy and the largest in a clump of 54 galaxies known as the ' @entity30 '			1
scientists believe @entity15 's extra weight must be in the form of dark matter , an invisible substance thought to bind galaxies together with its gravity			1
the galaxy , which is about the same size as the @entity1 , is believed to contain twice as much dark matter as our galactic home			1
previous studies were only able to measure the mass enclosed within the galaxies ' inner regions			2
the new study included the mass of outer region invisible matter			2
scientists believe @entity15 's extra weight must be in the form of dark matter , an invisible substance thought to bind galaxies together with its gravity			1
at approximately 2.5 million light - years away , the @entity15 , or @entity55 , is our @entity1 's largest galactic neighbour data on the known distances between galaxies in the @entity30 were used to calculate the total masses of @entity15 and the @entity1			1
the @entity1 is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars			2
this makes it a ‘ middleweight ’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known , @entity67 , containing more than 100 trillion stars			0
on a clear night , when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the @entity73 is about 2,500 stars			0
like more than two - thirds of the known galaxies , the @entity1 has a spiral shape			0
at the centre of the spiral , a lot of energy and , occasionally , vivid flares are created			0
based on the immense gravity that would be required explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled , the centre of the @entity1 could have a supermassive black hole			0
the findings , from a team led by dr @entity91 at the @entity92 , appear in the journal @entity94			0
dr @entity91 said : ' we always suspected that @entity15 is more massive than the @entity1 , but weighting both galaxies simultaneously proved to be extremely challenging			1
they researchers believe their work should help them learn more about how the outer regions of galaxies are structured			1
' our study combined recent measurements of the relative motion between our galaxy and @entity15 with the largest catalogue of nearby galaxies ever compiled to make this possible			1
' although both galaxies appear to be of similar dimensions , until now scientists had been unable to prove which is larger			0
dr @entity91 told @entity114 : ' we do n’t understand at all what dark matter might be and there are many theories			2
' what are research could do is help explain more about how this elusive material behaves			0
' the @entity1 is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars			2
here it is pictured above @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124			0

the @entity1 is 800 billion more massive than our sun , study *claims*
this means it has half the mass of the @entity15 galaxy
the extra weight may be down to the **existence** of elusive dark matter
work could help reveal how the outer regions of galaxies are structured
it could also shed light on the possible form and **existence** of dark matter
