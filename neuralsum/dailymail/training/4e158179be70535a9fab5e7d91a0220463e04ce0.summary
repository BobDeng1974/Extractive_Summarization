the jury heard @entity0 had ' an in - depth knowledge of criminal behavior and the frailty of human nature ' that she had gained from the studies that she used to aid the crimes			1
according to prosecutor @entity52 she played a ' robust , direct and calculating role ' in the conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine , spending thousands hiring cars and making trips on the @entity60 between @entity1 and @entity24			1
sometimes she would cover hundreds of miles in a day in her alleged attempts to aid the drug ring that spanned a length of the country			1
other times , one hire car would be dropped off and another one picked up ten minutes later , and these cars were frequently caught by speed cameras			0
every time one of the cars was caught , @entity0 would take the blame , but the pictures showed a black man was behind the wheel			0
@entity0 and @entity25 met when she was volunteering for a charity that put young men with mentors to stop them from breaking the law , and they soon developed a relationship			0
@entity81 said : ' how is it that this young lady , with all her ability and intelligence , gets involved in class a drugs ? ' it ’s a short stop beyond that to assist the man she ’s in a relationship with			2
' rather ironically , because of her qualifications , she had an in - depth knowledge of crime , and that it was up to the jury to decide whether she was someone with a “ misplaced attachment ” or whether she had been actively involved			1
' mr @entity81 said the defendants had no family and no fixed address in @entity24 but would often stay homes of drug users			1
one of the flats they used was in a block called @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity24 , also used by @entity22			1

@entity22 , 20 , was shot in the head in @entity24 in 2012 @entity22 ended up asking one of his customers for help and telling them he was in some sort of trouble			1
@entity22 and the customer entered flat four in @entity120 where @entity40 allegedly raised his arm , with a revolver in his hand , and fired two shots			2
one hit mr @entity22 in the head and the other in the right arm , causing him to fall to the floor , and @entity25 's palm print was later found on a wall above where @entity22 had collapsed			2
the court heard that the defendants were then seen leaving the building through a back door before briefly returning to collect their belongings from a friend 's home and by 11.31am they were in a taxi to another friend 's home in @entity143 where they were later picked up by @entity0			1
@entity40 was seen rubbing the taxi 's sun visor and rear doors with his sleeve , before they all changed their phone numbers later that day			0
mr @entity81 said there had been regular contact between @entity25 and @entity0 which ' spurred her to go to @entity143 to rescue them , and that according to texts between @entity25 and @entity0 that day , she must have known what happened that morning			0
one text from @entity0 to @entity25 said : ' do not disappear , that will look weird			0

be smart , act normal			0
i wish you had got your passport			0
' and a third message talked about them sunning themselves , semi-naked in @entity167			0
mr @entity81 said : ' this behaviour and these actions are an echo of her desire for the man she presumably loves as she wants his baby			0
' the allegation we make is that she is clearly assisting all three defendants			0
' @entity0 denies all charges , while @entity25 , of @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity1 , @entity40 , of @entity183 , @entity1 , and @entity41 , of @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity1 , all deny murder but have pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine			0
