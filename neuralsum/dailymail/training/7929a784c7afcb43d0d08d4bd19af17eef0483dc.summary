education minister @entity0 has denied he 's trying to save @entity2 jobs in his home state of @entity4 , from his own government and at the expense of the broadcaster 's other departments			1
just as his communications minister @entity9 was confirming that the @entity2 will lose more than $ 250 million in federal funding ( with up to 500 jobs expected to be shed before @entity12 ) and @entity13 $ 25 million , mr @entity0 took the unusual step of launching his own on - line petition on wednesday calling on the @entity2 board not to cut production in @entity4			1
his office has denied it 's a case of double standards , my @entity0 attempting to turn the blame onto the @entity2 board , accusing them of ' political vandalism ' if they choose to reduce production costs			1
the social media backlash against @entity0 's crusade was immediate a spokesman for @entity31 told @entity32 that ' he 's not saying that , he 's not saying that there should be cuts pushed on elsewhere , it 's because of the report ( @entity36 ) the ( communication ) minister received , which says there should be no cuts to programming '			2
in an interview with @entity2 891 , mr @entity0 said : ' obviously the @entity2 needs to make its contribution to reducing the debt and the deficit that @entity45 has left us			0
and @entity9 ’s done the job for them '			0
' he got @entity49 to do a report , the @entity36 , into how to reduce spending at the @entity2 , which showed that the spending could be reduced without any impact on production , without any impact on programming , ' mr @entity0 said			1
@entity0 hopes his campaign to save @entity2 jobs in @entity4 will be heard reaction to mr @entity0 's petition to save jobs in @entity4 has sparked much reaction ' so if @entity2 management in @entity65 decide to cut jobs and production in @entity68 , it is a deliberate act of political vandalism , because they know , they have the report in front of them , in black and white , showing how to reduce costs without affecting production and programming and that ’s what all out listeners need to know			1
' there is no need for there to be a production change here in @entity68 unless in @entity65 in @entity87 , they refuse to actually implement the report @entity9 had done for them			0
' mr @entity0 's petition via @entity91 states : ' we , the undersigned , are concerned that @entity2 in @entity4 is the last tv production unit outside of @entity87 and @entity94			1
' the @entity95 must reassure @entity96 that the local tv production house of the @entity2 will remain in @entity4			1
as noted in the @entity2 ’s 2013 annual report , @entity2 @entity4 produces top rating , award - winning shows such as @entity101 which is listed in the 12 most popular @entity102 made shows			0
' further , @entity2 @entity4 produces television that is often with a regional focus , including but not limited to @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity101 , the @entity109 orang - utan documentary at @entity110 , @entity112 50th anniversary tour documentary , a forthcoming country - based heritage restoration series and more			0
' these television series are targeted at individual groups within the community and are crucial to a diverse market			0
by moving @entity120 elsewhere , it will incur unnecessary costs and remove the efficient and innovative production unit from @entity4			0
' we , the undersigned , note that productions such as @entity125 has been produced here in @entity4 with a limited budget , while using innovative technology which has made it successful enough to be screened on @entity130 and @entity2 ’s @entity131			0
' we , the undersigned , strongly support the @entity2 staying as a production unit in @entity4 and for the @entity2 to adhere to its charter and continue to tell great stories “ that contribute to a sense of national identity … and reflect the cultural diversity of the @entity102 community ”			2
please ensure that the @entity2 does not close its production house in @entity68			0
' communications minister has revealed the cuts to the public broadcasters @entity2 and @entity13 saying ' if the @entity2 or @entity13 want to make decisions to change or cease programming ; that is their choice			1
the savings are not of a level that require any changes to programming ' mr @entity0 turned the heat up on the @entity95 today saying ' if @entity2 management in @entity65 decide to cut jobs and production in @entity68 , it is a deliberate act of political vandalism , because they know , they have the report in front of them , in black and white , showing how to reduce costs ' mr @entity9 has released details , claiming that changes to programming are not required and the savings can be found through ' operational efficiencies '			1
his statement read : ' @entity165 was launched in january to identify how the @entity2 and @entity13 could find efficiencies in their back office operations , finance , property , it , administration , corporate and marketing , without impacting on programming '			2
' in total , including the 1 per cent down - payment announced in the may budget , the overall savings to the broadcasters is $ 308 million over five years or 4.4 per cent of taxpayers ' investment , ' mr @entity9 stated			2
' for the @entity2 this means it will receive $ 5.2 billion over five years rather than $ 5.5 billion , a saving of $ 254 million or 4.6 per cent			1
' the government is confident that these savings can be achieved without affecting the diverse range and quality of programmes provided by the @entity2 or @entity13			2
suggestions that popular programs or services are at risk because of @entity192 savings are not credible			0
' if the @entity2 or @entity13 want to make decisions to change or cease programming ; that is their choice			2
the savings are not of a level that require any changes to programming			0
' programming changes are decisions for the @entity202 of the organisations , not the government			0
' as for his colleague calling on jobs to be specifically saved in @entity4 , mr @entity9 said ' @entity0 is representing his electorate , everybody is entitled to their opinion ' .			1
