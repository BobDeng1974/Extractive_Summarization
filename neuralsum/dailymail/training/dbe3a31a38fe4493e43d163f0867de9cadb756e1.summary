statins are not as safe or effective at preventing heart attacks as patients have been led to believe the benefits of taking statins have been exaggerated , two leading experts claim			1
they say the cholesterol - lowering medicines – hailed as miracle drugs when they hit the market 20 years ago – are not as safe or effective at preventing heart attacks as patients have been led to believe			1
although they can dramatically cut cholesterol levels , they have ‘ failed to substantially improve cardiovascular outcomes ’ , says an analysis of data in clinical trials			1
it was carried out by dr @entity18 , a professor of molecular pharmacology at the @entity20 , and expert in cardiovascular disease dr @entity22			0
they say many studies touting statins ’ efficacy have failed to note serious side effects			2
they also claim ‘ statistical deception ’ has been used to make inflated claims about their effectiveness , which has misled the public			0
the two authors say in the analysis , published in the @entity36 : ‘ the adverse effects suffered by people taking statins are more common than reported in the media and at medical conferences			0
‘ increased rates of cancer , cataracts , diabetes , cognitive impairments and musculoskeletal disorders more than offset the modest cardiovascular benefits of statin treatment			0
’ they conclude : ‘ there is a great appeal to the public to take a pill that offers the promise of a longer life and to live heart attack free			0
‘ the reality , however , is that statins actually produce only small beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes , and their adverse effects are far more substantial than is generally known			1
’ in july , @entity65 rationing body @entity63 said statins should be given to 17million patients , almost 40 per cent of the adult population			1
the @entity70 experts say those who champion the medication have often presented data in a way that exaggerates the benefits			0
in july @entity63 said statins should be given to 17million patients - almost 40 per cent of the adult population ‘ statin advocates have used statistical deception to create the illusion that statins are “ wonder drugs , ” when the reality is that their modest benefits are more than offset by their adverse effects ’ , they claim			1
the analysis takes a critical look at the @entity88 and the @entity89 ( @entity89 )			0
it claims that in the @entity88 trial , the public and doctors were told of a 54 per cent reduction in heart attacks , when the actual reduction was less than 1 percentage point			2
in the @entity89 - @entity89 study , the improvement in patient outcomes with @entity101 treatment was 1.1 percentage points , said the analysis			2
but when this study was presented to the public , @entity70 advertisements transformed this into a 36 per cent cut in the risk of having a heart attack			0
the inflated claims and playing down of the adverse effects have helped to boost enthusiasm for the cholesterol - lowering drugs among health care providers and the public , say the authors .			1
