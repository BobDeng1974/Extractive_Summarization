by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 05:32 est , 21 august 2012 scientists have today released a new concoction which could help clear up the mess of an oil spill - and it involves the types of ingredients you might normally find on a dessert dish			1
following concerns about the health and environmental effects of oil dispersants following the @entity14 disaster in 2010 , scientists described a new dispersant made from edible ingredients that both breaks up oil slicks and keeps oil from sticking to the feathers of birds			1
reporting on the mixture , @entity22 , from the @entity23 , told the @entity24 , said : ' each of the ingredients in our dispersant is used in common food products like peanut butter , chocolate and whipped cream			2
' clean up : fire boats battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig @entity14 , off @entity37 , in april 2010 an oil - covered bird is pulled from the sea following the @entity14 catastrophe : the new mixture could stop such situations @entity22 , a @entity44 graduate , said : ' other scientists are working on new oil dispersants and absorbents , but nothing that 's quite like ours			1
' it not only breaks up oil but prevents the deposition of oil on birds and other objects , like the ingredients in laundry detergent keep grease from redepositing on clothing in the rinse cycle			1
' birds can sit in slicks of the dispersed oil , they can dive through it and take off and flap their wings , and the oil will fall off			1
' @entity22 's colleague , @entity68 , @entity44 , developed the concept for the new dispersant , and the research team now has moved the material from concept to a prototype dispersant suitable for testing on actual oil spills			2
the new formula can stop oil clinging to the skin and feathers of wildlife - potentially saving hundreds of thousands of avian lives @entity68 said the new dispersant is based on scientific principles established decades ago during the development of modern laundry detergents			1
one ingredient , for instance , is a special polymer that sticks to the surface of oil droplets to keep them from sticking to the feathers of sea birds			1
similar polymers in laundry detergents keep oil and grease removed during the wash cycle from getting back on clothing during the rinse cycle			0
that feature in the new dispersant would be critical for minimising damage to wildlife and beaches , @entity22 noted			0
when detergents are used to remove oil that has coated fur or feathers , it defeats their natural waterproofing effect , leaving birds less buoyant and more susceptible to hypothermia			2
once the catastrophe has been stopped , a clean - up could be easier due to the dessert mixture birds can also eat the oil as they try to clean themselves , causing internal damage			1
by some estimates , almost 225,000 birds died in this way after being covered in oil from the 1989 @entity121 off the coast of @entity123			2
another important advantage , @entity22 noted , is the ease of quickly obtaining large amounts of ingredients , even ton quantities , for making the dispersant at reasonable cost			0
she envisioned agencies like the @entity132 keeping small amounts on hand for first response , with larger quantities being quickly made as necessary			0
with funding from the @entity138 , @entity22 helped the group move from the prototype they had developed in the lab to a version that would be ready to be tested and approved for use with future oil spills			0
the group used a robotic device to quickly screen thousands of possible combinations until they settled on a winning formula			0
the team had support from large chemical manufacturers , including the @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 for ingredient selection and supply			0
in order to move to commercialization of this technology , it will now be necessary to seek partners and end - use customers with interest in testing the product .			0

detergent - style mixture breaks up slicks in the ocean and stops oil sticking to sea - birds
