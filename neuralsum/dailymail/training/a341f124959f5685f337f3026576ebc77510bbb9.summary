dr @entity7 admits making the assertions , but denies any of his conduct was dishonest or misleading			1
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) alleges that dr @entity7 overstated the effectiveness of the treatment - without enough evidence to support his claims			1
@entity60 , for the @entity23 , said : ‘ dr @entity7 faces an allegation that his fitness to practise is impaired by reason of his misconduct			2
‘ the misconduct in question concerns dr @entity7 ’s misleading statements made in late 2012 to two individuals , one a genuine patient with advanced cancer and the other an undercover reporter posing as the husband of a woman with advanced cancer , about the effectiveness of a private medical treatment he was offering to provide			1
’ during treatment , a patient is given a ‘ sensitiser ’ then exposed to a light bed and a hand - held ultrasound device , the hearing was told			0
this is said to activate the sensitiser within the tumour site and kill cancer cells as well as provoking an immune response within the patient , the panel heard			2
@entity14 is a development of a conventionally accepted treatment , @entity93 ( @entity93 ) , which uses light alone to activate the sensitiser for tumours lying on or close to the skin			0
@entity14 is said to have the ability to penetrate deeper into the body than some treatments			0
mr @entity60 said : ‘ the @entity23 ’s case is that @entity14 is indeed a novel form of treatment and one in respect of which the evidence of effectiveness is , and was in 2012 , extremely limited			0
‘ it is also the kind of unconventional private treatment that patients with advanced and serious forms of cancer may turn to , in a state of some desperation , after the failure of conventional forms of treatment to address their condition			0
‘ in this context it is essential that any doctor offering the treatment should provide accurate and non-misleading information about the evidence of its effectiveness			0
‘ the @entity23 alleges that dr @entity7 ’s statements about @entity14 were misleading , because they had the effect of overstating the evidence of its effectiveness without drawing attention sufficiently to the limitations of the evidence			1
’ mr @entity60 told the panel that while dr @entity7 appears to be a genuine enthusiast of the new treatment which may prove to be effective , his knowledge of the evidence available at the time meant that the picture he painted of the service was not justified			2
‘ accordingly , it is alleged that dr @entity7 ’s conduct was dishonest as well as simply misleading , ’ he added			1
the @entity36 on @entity35 where dr @entity7 is alleged to have ' misled ' patients over the effectiveness of a novel cancer treatment a man in the late stages of cancer , known only as @entity148 , consulted dr @entity7 in september 2013 after researching alternative therapies			1

the medic is alleged to have said ‘ there is a strong possibility that we would be able to increase your median survival time ’			0
dr @entity7 did make it clear that it was not a cure , but an experimental treatment which needed further trials , but did say there was a ‘ strong possibility ’ of extending the patient ’s life			2
‘ @entity148 was a man with advanced cancer who was seeking assistance from alternative therapies in a desperate situation , ’ mr @entity60 said			0
‘ dr @entity7 ’s statement regarding his survival time , whether considered on its own or in the context of all the other communication with @entity148 , was misleading			2
’ reporter @entity175 posed as the husband of a woman suffering from breast cancer during a meeting with dr @entity7 in december 2012 , during which he raised the subject of @entity14			1
dr @entity7 explained the theory before telling him : ‘ you do n’t have to belong to a religion to believe in it			0
it ’s not some wacky idea			0
’ he went on to say it was more effective than chemotherapy in similar cases claiming it resulted in ‘ significant tumour cell death ’ in 80 per cent of patients			0
he also suggested the rate of long - term survivors was just under 10 per cent			0
dr @entity7 also repeated the key claims in later correspondence with mr @entity175 once he had revealed he was a journalist			2
