by @entity0 last updated at 7:11 pm on 4th october 2011 benefit cheat : mother of nine @entity3 claimed £ 40,000 in benefits to get a second house a nurse swindled £ 40,000 from the taxpayer by claiming to be a homeless mother - of - nine to get a second council house			1
@entity3 already had a family sized home in @entity12 when she applied for and was given a £ 300,000 property in @entity14 , north @entity15			1
she then moved into the home in @entity14 and rented her second @entity12 address to her adult children for four years before being caught out			2
the deception only came to light after data from the two councils ' was cross referenced by the @entity24			2
today the 53 - year - old was given a nine month suspended sentence for obtaining services by deception after @entity29 heard her youngest daughter was just 16 years old			1
judge @entity31 said : ' although i am sure your offence is sufficiently serious to warrant a custodial sentence , i am prepared to suspend the sentence in this case because of your personal circumstances			2
the court heard @entity3 , who only has three of her nine children living with her , dodged £ 40,000 in rent when she was handed a £ 300,000 three - bedroom property in @entity43 , @entity14 , a year after she secretly signed the lease on a family - sized home in @entity12			1
@entity3 , who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing , gave the @entity12 home to her adult children , who were all working , at a vastly subsidized rate			1
she then continued to visit @entity12 to fool housing officers that she was living there			2
judge @entity31 said : ' i have no doubt that you knew that what you were doing was wrong and dishonest			0
suspended sentence : nurse @entity3 escaped jail for falsely claiming £ 40,000 at @entity58 ' you allowed @entity60 to keep treating you as homeless and considering you a priority for a large house in @entity14			1
' this carried on for a period of almost four years and there were several occasions when you could have put the matters right but you failed on each occasion to do so			0
' benefit fraud is never a victimless crime and by your actions you have prevented another family who were genuinely entitled to a property from being housed			0
' the court heard @entity3 was first assessed to be homeless by @entity60 in 1997 when she was placed on the housing waiting list and housed in temporary accommodation at a cost of £ 80,000 per year			1
she then went behind @entity60 's back to register as homeless in @entity12 in 2005 , claiming she was a single mother with nine dependents			0
she was offered a property in @entity83 , @entity12 , in september 2005 - meaning she should have been removed from her temporary accommodation in @entity14 and taken off the housing list			0
instead she was offered a three - bedroom property in @entity43 in 2006 , where she still lives with three of her children , the youngest of which is 16			0
prosecutor @entity90 said : ' housing is extremely scarce and is at a premium			0
especially scarce are those large houses such as that given to mrs @entity3			1
they are intended for those at their lowest ebb and particularly vulnerable			0
' added to the cost of the benefit there is also the cost of housing @entity103 in temporary accommodation while she had a secure property - estimated at £ 80,000 a year			0
' defence barrister @entity107 said @entity3 was extremely devastated to have been suspended from her job and risk losing her home			1
she added that she had been put under pressure to apply for the second home by her older children , who wanted the benefit of cheaper rent			0
@entity3 , who has been suspended from her job at @entity115 in @entity116 , where she is being sponsored to study for a degree , is waiting to hear whether she will be allowed to keep her home in @entity14			1
speaking outside court , the 53 - year - old said : ' i have to accept what the judge has said			2
it has been a very stressful time and i have been worried about the outcome .			0
