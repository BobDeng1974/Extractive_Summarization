for some , putting up some basic shelving constitutes a major @entity2 project			0
@entity2 for one @entity4 father , however , is slightly more extreme , as he ’s built a 180 - foot - long roller coaster in his backyard			1
@entity7 , 50 , made his son ’s dream come true after he was asked to build the roller coaster at their home in @entity13 after a trip to a local theme park – but he very probably made his own dream come true , too			1
his project was finally complete after spending around $ 3,500 on building materials and grafting for more than 300 hours			1
e-commerce management consultant mr @entity7 said : ‘ like most things in life , this project all came about because i got excited by an idea			1
mr @entity7 was so desperate to share his love of physics that he even set up his own website , @entity30 captured on film : mr @entity7 made a series of pov @entity44 videos to document his progress size matters : the roller coaster stretches around the @entity49 ' huge backyard rigorous : mr @entity7 tested the coaster using a frame on wheels testing times : a cart is filmed hurtling around a bend ‘ we were just back from one of many amusement park trips and @entity58 asked a simple question , “ why do n't we build our own roller coaster , @entity61 ? ” ‘ i could n't think of a single good reason to say no so @entity58 and i headed off to the lumber yard for a few supplies			1
‘ today , our backyard roller coaster is an unending source of excitement , challenge , education , and connection			1
‘ the coaster is complete and fully operational , although we keep adding onto it and making modifications			2
maintenance : mr @entity7 showing damage to the cart track day : the @entity49 check that everything will run smoothly ‘ i would say it 's more of an experiment so it will probably never be finished , as long as there are still things to try and learn			1
‘ the track as it is today has a complete loop that 's about 180 feet around , with the whole thing taking six months to build			2
’ mr @entity7 said he has had several requests from fans asking him to build them backyard roller coasters			1
the father - of - two also revealed his son @entity58 , 10 , and daughter @entity94 , 12 , were the inspiration behind the gravity - defying project			2
he added : ‘ @entity61 is all about sharing information and ideas about backyard roller coasters , but even more , it 's here to support science education for kids			2
‘ people started asking if we did this kind of thing for a living and if could we go and build backyard roller coasters for other families			2
‘ if i 'm honest , i ca n't think of a single good reason to say no so that could well happen in the future			0
‘ our mission is purely to share our love of physics , family , and fun so one thing has just led to another			0
‘ the whole family has been involved in the project and the neighbours always check in to see how we 're doing			0
‘ it 's amazing that all of this came from a kid asking one simple question and a dad saying yes			0
’ according to mr @entity7 's latest post on @entity30 , there are still a few teething problems to overcome as a new cart he 'd built crashed the third time it was sent around the track			1
mr @entity7 wrote : ' the track was going up fast and beautiful ...			1
. and we were in high spirits as we ran the new cart down the new track during our first test			0
then , it happened ! it was time for us to switch from being super pleased with ourselves into a slightly less comfortable , but ultimately more productive mode : namely , learning from @entity149 mode ! ' we ran the new cart down the track three times			0
the first and second times , things seemed to go well			0
the third time , as they say , was the charm			0
but only if you define the word “ charm ” as metal - on - metal - crash - with - cart - filp - and - disappointment			0

@entity7 , 50 , from @entity13 has built a 180 - foot - long roller coaster in his backyard
he has spent around $ 3,500 on materials and put in around 300 hours of hard work to build the incredible *structure*
the finished track took around six months to build and mr @entity7 documented his progress online
