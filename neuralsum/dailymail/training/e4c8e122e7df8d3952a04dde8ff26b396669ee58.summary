@entity7 asked @entity0 a slew of very personal questions and , if he failed to answer any , @entity8 had a can of spray cheese she would pump into his mouth			2
then , things got a bit more interesting when @entity0 , who has starred in films alongside actresses including @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , was asked to reveal who was his worst onscreen kiss			1
' @entity62 , ' he quickly replied , who he starred with in the @entity64 nominated 2008 flop @entity65			0
he then added , ' i think she purposefully ate like a feast of onions before the scene			0
' next , @entity7 asked @entity0 to talk about his @entity33 costar @entity32 , and share with the world the dumbest thing she said while they were filming the comedy			1
' she said one day , '' are we making a movie ? '' that was kind of dumb , ' @entity19 laughingly replied			0
feast of onion : @entity19 , shown with @entity62 in @entity65 , said she had the worst on - screen kiss in the clubhouse : @entity19 and @entity8 of @entity9 were guests on the chat show having properly shamed his leading ladies , the talk then turned to his sex life , and how many college girls the comic slept with while on the road and touring at campuses around the country			1
' in my younger days , i would say a few hundred , ' @entity19 replied			0
at this point @entity8 put the cheese down , realizing @entity0 was not going to leave any of @entity7 's questions unanswered			2
going gay : @entity0 revealed that if he had to sleep with a male comic , it would be @entity101 ( pictured above with cook ) no laughing matter : when asked to reveal who he believed to be the most overrated comic , @entity0 went with famed watermelon smasher @entity45 ( above ) finally , the very heterosexual @entity0 was asked by @entity7 what male comic he would go gay for , to which he responded ' @entity101 , ' who appeared on his @entity112 tour			1
