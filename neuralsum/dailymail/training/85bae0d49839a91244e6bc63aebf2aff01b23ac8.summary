by @entity0 a woman is risking ovarian cancer to give herself a chance of motherhood			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , has the so - called ' breast cancer gene ' which meant she had a terrifyingly high chance of developing both breast and ovarian cancers			1
she decided to have a double mastectomy and had her fallopian tubes removed but , despite the risk , opted to keep her ovaries until she has tried @entity18 treatment			1
@entity5 has the @entity20 gene mutation which means her chance of developing breast cancer was between 70 and 80 per cent			1
she also had a 40 to 60 per cent chance of developing ovarian cancer already being in her 40s , mrs @entity25 was advised to have surgery to remove her breasts and ovaries as soon as possible as the threat of cancer was increasing with every passing year			1
but she wanted to try and fulfill her dream of motherhood first so will retain her ovaries for a few more years to give herself a final chance of @entity18 treatment			1
mrs @entity25 , who has the @entity20 gene mutation , said : ‘ i was haunted by the fact we had n’t had children			1
‘ my husband is a very lovely man – he was just worried about my health			0
‘ he would rather know i was ok and forego having a family			0
mrs @entity25 ( pictured with her husband and bridesmaids on her wedding day ) was advised to have her ovaries and breasts removed to reduce her cancer risk mrs @entity25 wants to try @entity18 treatment so she decided to risk retaining her ovaries			1
however , she has had her fallopian tubes and breasts removed to lower her cancer risk as much as possible ‘ my delaying the surgery made him upset			1
he was worried about me			0
’ she added : ‘ for me it is a very sensitive topic because we were trying for children when i learned i had @entity20			0
‘ if i had children i would have wanted to go for the surgery to ensure i would be there for my children			0
’ @entity20 and @entity59 are genes that are linked with breast cancer and ovarian cancer			1
if there is a fault , or mutation , in one of them , the risk of breast and ovarian cancer is high			2
the average woman has a 10 per cent chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime			2
people who have a fault in one of the breast cancer genes have a 50 to 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer			2
if a woman with the gene mutation has surgery to remove her breasts , she can reduce her risk of breast cancer by 90 to 95 per cent			1
having a @entity59 gene mutation also increases the risk of ovarian cancer to about 50 per cent			1
however , this risk can be reduced through surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes			2
both men and women can carry the gene mutation and people can inherit it from either their mother or their father			2
if a person has a parent with the gene mutation , there is a 50 per cent chance they will inherit it			2
source : @entity104 mrs @entity25 ’s mother and father both suffered from breast cancer			2
her father developed the disease when he was about 70 and her mother was diagnosed at 39			0
tragically , her mother died from a heart attack - associated with complication from her cancer treatment - at the age of 59 but her father lived into old age			2
two of mrs @entity25 ’s three paternal aunts also died of ovarian cancer in their early 50s			0
with such a strong family history of cancer , mrs @entity25 was not surprised when , in july 2012 , she learned she had the @entity20 gene mutation			1
however , she says what many people are surprised to learn is that she inherited it from her father – not her mother			0
she said : ‘ i sort of knew i would get a positive result – it was a gut feeling			0
‘ i dealt with it by realising it was n’t new – i had always had it , it just gave me the information i needed to help me make decisions about my future			0
‘ it helped me understand what we had been observing in the family			0
’ she added : ‘ brca is not all bad because you can do something about it but it is vital that people realise it can also be passed down the male line			0
‘ this means women who have a history of female cancers on their fathers ’ side of the family need to be aware that they are also at risk			0
’ when mrs @entity25 was told she had the gene mutation she learned that she had a shocking 70 to 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and a 40 to 60 per cent chance of developing ovarian cancer			1
mrs @entity25 said : ‘ i had no knowledge of the ovarian cancer risk when i was told i had @entity20 – i just thought it was about breast cancer			1
‘ i just sat on the knowledge for six months but it started to eat away at me			0
’ mrs @entity25 's mother and father both had breast cancer and two of her aunts had ovarian cancer			1
as a result , she was not surprised when she was told she had the brca gene mutation mrs @entity25 ( pictured with her nephew ) inherited the @entity20 gene mutation from her father - she says a lot of people do not realise this is possible as the gene mutation is associated with female cancers she added : ‘ i believe in using the information for the best for each person			1
’ as a result , mrs @entity25 discussed her options with @entity185 , a consultant gynaecologist at @entity186 , in @entity6			0
she decided to go ahead with a double mastectomy – which took place in february this year – and surgery to remove her fallopian tubes – which took place in november last year			1
she says she found the decision about gynaecological surgery much more gruelling and says she was very grateful for mr @entity185 ’s support			0
mrs @entity25 ( pictured with her father ) says she found it empowering to be able to chose which operations she wanted to have and to decide when to have them mrs @entity25 said of learning she had the gene mutation : ' i dealt with it by realising it was n't new - i had always had it , it just gave me the information i needed to help me make decisions about my future ' mrs @entity25 was advised that many ovarian cancers in @entity59 carriers are believed to start in the fallopian tubes and spread to the ovaries , so she may well have substantially reduced her cancer risk just by having her fallopian tubes removed			1
however , this has not yet been proved to be an effective way of preventing ovarian cancer and as she gets older the chance of developing cancer in her remaining ovaries is increasing			2
she told @entity218 : ‘ deciding which operations to have , and when , has been a very empowering experience – it has been a very positive experience			0
’ she added : ‘ there are ways of managing the risks around your values and goals			0
‘ i told my gynaecological surgeon ( mr @entity185 ) , “ i can cope with being childless and penniless but i ca n’t cope with being childless , penniless and a cancer patient ”			0
’ mrs @entity25 is considering having a special type of @entity18 treatment which would allow her to select an embryo that does not have the @entity20 gene mutation mrs @entity25 ( pictured with her father ) will probably have her ovaries removed once she had tried for children before having her ovaries removed mrs @entity25 is now considering ivf treatment			1
she is looking into the possibility of a special type of @entity18 which would involve selecting an embryo that does not carry the @entity20 gene mutation - this is known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis			1
without this technology , any child she has would have a 50 per cent chance of carrying the gene mutation			2
mr @entity185 told @entity218 : ‘ @entity5 ’s story serves as an important reminder that this gene can pass equally through the male and female lines – a lot of people do n’t realise this			0
' it is important women do n't ignore cancer history in their father 's side			0
a family history of cancer on either side should be discussed with their gp , who can if necessary refer them to local clinical genetics services for more information and gene testing , if appropriate			0

@entity5 , who is in her 40s , has the @entity20 gene mutation
this means her chance of breast cancer was about 70 to 80 **%**
she also had a 40 to 60 **%** chance of developing ovarian cancer
she was advised to have her ovaries , fallopian tubes and breasts removed
so , she had a double mastectomy and her fallopian tubes removed
but , she decided to keep her ovaries for now so she can try @entity18 treatment
she inherited the gene mutation from her father - not her mother
