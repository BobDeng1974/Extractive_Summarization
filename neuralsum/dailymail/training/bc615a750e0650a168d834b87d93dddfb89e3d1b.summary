few countries can compete with the @entity1 when it comes to television costume dramas			0
but @entity6 audiences , it seems , prefer our dramas without the costumes			2
a raunchy alternative version of the ten - part @entity12 series @entity11 has been created for screening in the @entity6 – including graphic sex and nude scenes which do n’t appear here			1
the independent production company behind the medieval drama came up with two ‘ edits ’ – one for the @entity12 and the other for @entity6 cable @entity19 , the company behind @entity21 and @entity22			1
raunchy : an alternative version of the ten - part @entity12 series @entity11 has been created for screening in the @entity6 - including graphic sex and nude scenes which don ¿ t appear here different : the production company behind the medieval drama came up with two ' edits '			1
this shows how the @entity6 version goes further than the @entity12 version above bedroom scenes in which actors appear in the @entity12 version partly clothed are sexed - up for the @entity6 market – and the actors complete the scenes naked			1
as lead actor @entity39 put it : ‘ there ’s the @entity12 cut and the @entity19 cut			2
you get a lot more a * * * in the @entity19 version – the cameras kept rolling after the @entity12 stopped the scene			1
’ the @entity49 has seen the first three episodes of the @entity6 version – dubbed @entity51 – and can confirm the @entity6 version is more stripper than bodice ripper			1
in episode two , broadcast by the @entity12 on june 23 , @entity55 , played by @entity56 , was seen wearing a nightdress for her love scene with @entity60 , played by @entity39			2
cheeky : @entity39 revealed only his naked chest to @entity1 audiences			0
but in the @entity6 they see a good deal more of actor but when the clinch is broadcast on @entity6 television later this summer , the same actress will be shown first topless and then completely naked in the marital bed			2
several other passionate encounters are entirely missing from the @entity12 version , including one involving the @entity75 ’s treacherous brother @entity74 , played by @entity76 , and new wife @entity77 , played by @entity78			1
the scene , which appears in episode two of the @entity6 series , includes a shot of the @entity84 ’s naked bottom			1
young actress @entity85 , who plays @entity86 , has also spoken of the steamy scenes			0
‘ i looked at them and went “ wow ” , ’ she said , ‘ because it ’s my first job and i ’ve never done them before , but it ’s important to the story			0
’ steamy : there is no mistaking the passion between the @entity75			0
in this scene from the @entity12 version , she is fully dressed passion : however , in the @entity6 version , the actress is completely topless episodes one , two and three of the @entity6 version all contain nudity and the first programme includes at least four shots of the @entity51 ’s breasts and a scene showing her younger sister topless in a bath			1
by contrast , the @entity12 version does n’t include any nudity until episode three , and even then only fleetingly			1
one of the biggest contrasts between the two versions involves the @entity75 and @entity51 ’s first night of passion in a hunting lodge in episode one			0
the @entity12 version contains no full nudity as a shirtless @entity75 starts to undress his wife before they make love in the marital bed			2
the scene ends when the @entity75 rises from the bed , telling his wife : ‘ i must wash			0
’ one of @entity128 's younger sisters can be seen in the bath , with @entity1 audiences not seeing too much flesh revealing : but in the @entity6 version , viewers get to see a whole lot more instead , @entity6 will see a five - second shot of the @entity51 topless and a shot of a naked king as he walks down to the lake to wash			2
in the @entity12 ’s episode two , the @entity75 begins to undress his wife again and asks her : ‘ how is it that i have allowed you to wear so many clothes			0
star : @entity55 played by @entity145 ' what is the point of being @entity75 if i can not keep you naked all day ? ’ yet the @entity51 remains clad in a nightdress as the scene ends with a topless @entity75 climbing into bed with her			0
@entity6 viewers , however , will see a love scene which features prolonged shots of the @entity51 ’s breasts and the @entity75 ’s naked bottom			0
the @entity11 , based on a series of bestselling historical novels by @entity160 , is a co-production between the @entity12 and @entity19			1
costume drama can cost as much as £ 1 million an hour to produce and co-productions between different broadcasters are nothing new			0
but it is rare that versions of the same show can be so radically different			0
a spokesman for the @entity12 said that @entity169 , which produced the film for the @entity12 and @entity19 , created two versions to meet the broadcasters ’ differing requirements			2
she said the @entity12 was delighted with the success of its sunday night drama and had no idea what was in the @entity6 version			1
@entity19 , one of @entity6 ’s most successful subscription channels , bills the drama as a ‘ sizzling ’ tale of ‘ love and lust ’ which follows the fortunes of three women ‘ who seduce their way ’ on to the @entity190 throne .			0
