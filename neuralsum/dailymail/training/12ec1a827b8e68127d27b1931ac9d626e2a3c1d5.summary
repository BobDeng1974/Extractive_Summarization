by @entity0 published : 20:32 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 20:32 est , 6 july 2013 reform : sir @entity2 is set to propose a £ 10,000 pay rise for all mps government ministers tried to sack 200 commons cleaners , cooks and manual workers to justify a £ 10,000 pay rise for mps , it was claimed last night			1
the aim was to use the £ 6.5million staff savings to finance the salary hike for mps and show that the overall cost of running @entity17 had not gone up			1
but it was rejected after officials warned there would be uproar if mps sacked low paid workers to give themselves a 15 per cent rise			0
the row was disclosed on the eve of a new pay deal for mps which is expected to say they deserve a £ 10,000 rise on their £ 66,396 salary			2
all three party leaders have expressed doubts about a big pay rise , but they are powerless to stop it because @entity17 handed over control of @entity28 ’ pay to the @entity38 , headed by sir @entity2 who has hinted strongly he thought @entity28 deserved a significant pay hike			1
instead , @entity40 hopes to avoid public furore by showing the overall cost of running @entity17 has not gone up			1
commons sources say senior officials have asked @entity45 chiefs to find ‘ substantial savings ’ to offset the cost of the @entity28 ’ rise			2
outrage : one proposal would have meant sacking 200 cleaners from the @entity51 the officials were told the only way would be to get rid of more than 200 commons workers , most of whom earn less than £ 20,000 a year			0
the parliamentary chiefs warned any such move would be ‘ grossly insensitive ’			0
an insider said : ‘ the idea that anyone could sack people who earn a fraction of an @entity28 ’ salary to give them an extra ten grand is offensive			0

plan would have limited overall cost of running @entity17 despite pay rise
