@entity0 could be in line for his first start for @entity3 on tuesday night against @entity4 having made an instant impact in the @entity7 capital after his move from @entity9			1
it did not go unnoticed in @entity7 at the weekend that as @entity3 managed to score eight goals against @entity13 , @entity11 failed to register			1
‘ @entity0 ’ climbed off the bench to score two of the goal of the season contenders late in the second half and now @entity18 is under pressure to pick the @entity21			1
@entity18 defended @entity11 after the game , saying that he looked at more than the names of the goalscorers			2
@entity0 scored twice against @entity13 at the weekend and could start on tuesday @entity0 trains alongside @entity25 and @entity26 ahead of the game with @entity4 on tuesday @entity0 has become an instant hero at @entity3 after scoring twice against @entity13 ‘ he played well in @entity30 even though he did n't score ; i look at things beyond that , ’ he said			1
but he is expected to leave @entity11 out of his staring line - up as @entity3 look to get their second win in the space of four days			2
it may still be that young attacking midfielder @entity25 is the man who benefits from @entity11 being rested and that @entity0 has to content himself with another place on the bench but whatever happens his two goals have immediately earned him a place in the affections of @entity3 supporters – especially those who jeered and whistled the @entity48 striker at every turn in the club ’s last home game in the @entity52 against @entity53			1
in truth , @entity0 ’s spectacular showing against @entity13 owed much to the way the game had gone with weak opposition long since having thrown in the towel when he made his entrance			2
@entity0 scored two stunning goals against @entity13 and has impressed since his arrival in @entity3 @entity0 celebrates his goal with team - mates @entity64 and @entity66 @entity0 came on in place of @entity11 he will find far more space late in games in @entity70 – especially against team who have already accepted heavy defeat against @entity3 before he makes his entrance			1
strikers never like to be taken off at the end of games because they know there are rich pickings as the clock ticks down and the gaps in tired defences begin to appear			0
after years of struggling to find space in the @entity82 that will come as a welcomed change			0
and ‘ welcome change ’ is the way many @entity3 supporters see the ‘ @entity88 ’s ’ arrival at the @entity87			0
the theory put forward last summer by @entity11 ’s defenders in the @entity7 capital was that he would respond badly to competition and so a replacement for @entity95 was never bought			0
but his credit has run dry since then and the competition is now up and running			0
@entity0 has gone from contesting a place in the starting line - up with @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 at @entity9 to trying to oust @entity11 at the @entity87			2
saturday 's spectacular double has given him the perfect launch pad for a far more prosperous career in @entity7 than he enjoyed at @entity105			0
