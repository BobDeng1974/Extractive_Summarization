middle class families earning more than £ 50,000 a year will get up to £ 1,000 a year to pay for childcare – half what was originally planned			0
deputy prime minister @entity3 has revealed the ‘ squeezed middle ’ will benefit from a coalition overhaul of childcare as well as parents lower down the income scale			1
but the @entity8 has learned the plans to give parents tax breaks will now be delayed for another two months because the £ 1.4billion costs will have to be paid for through measures in the @entity13 , due on march 20			2
extra help with the huge cost of nurseries and childminders is to be extended to struggling middle class families in another flip - flop from initial plans to hand £ 2,000 to parents , the sum will be slashed in half because the @entity24 ca n’t find the money to pay for it			1
a row continues in @entity27 about how far up the income scale the handouts should go			0
the childcare package was supposed to be announced earlier this month as part of the government ’s midterm relaunch			0
but officials across @entity27 say mr @entity35 wants to hold on to the tax announcement in order to make it near the @entity13			0
deputy pm @entity3 said he was determined to extend help with childcare bills to middle class families instead education minister @entity42 will next week only unveil plans to change the regulation of childcare			2

it had been claimed that the @entity52 were insisting only the poorest families will get the money			1
but @entity3 said he was ‘ unambiguously in favour ’ of giving more support to ‘ the @entity57 middle classes ’ who do not feel well off when they are forced to spend up to 15 per cent of their income on childcare			2
officials have told the @entity8 that @entity65 are winning the argument that some taxpayers who pay the 40p rate – which kicks in at £ 37,000 – will get the money			1
‘ that is a safe assumption , ’ said one source			0
the @entity65 want middle class families to get help with childcare to offset some of the anger about the decision to slash child benefit			1
