new radar images have shown that @entity2 colonists may have settled in a remote part of what is now @entity5 more than 400 years ago - potentially solving a centuries - old mystery			1
it was never fully known where a group of 120 settlers from @entity10 ended up after they left @entity12 and headed to the ' @entity13 '			2
historians have debated the fate of the so - called ' @entity16 ' for years - having been left with no more evidence than the word ' @entity19 ' carved into a tree near the abandoned settlement			2
researchers may have now taken a large step towards settling the debate after enlisting the help of magnetometers and ground - penetrating radar ( @entity28 )			1
and , in the stuff of a schoolboy 's dreams , the researchers have backed up the glittering technology 's findings with ' secret ' evidence from a 400 - year - old map drawn by one of the settlement 's founders			2
location , location , location : @entity43 is located just off what is now the state of @entity5 ( seen in this 16th century map in red )			2
the area of recent interest is the section at the left centre of the map where the two rivers meet modern version : a satellite map of the @entity57 area of @entity58 shows how accurate @entity60 's map is			1
the area of interest is just above @entity62 in @entity63 last year the map - drawn in 1585 by @entity60 , an artist and friend of famed explorer sir @entity67 - rekindled interest in the fate of the lost colonists			1
tests found a hidden section of the map , drawn in a style of invisible ink and covered with paper , which provided a tantalising hint at the possible location of what may have been intended as the colony 's capital near @entity43			1
around 70 miles away from the island , at the end of @entity57 , the covered section of the map disguises what appears to be diamond - shaped drawing that was often used to mark a defensive postion of fort			1
the latest images are far from the handsome maps of yore , however , as the @entity28 photos are difficult for the untrained eye to decipher			1
they display magnetomer - produced images that show anomalies in the ground distribution in the area			1
markings : experts say the black spots on the image above show ditches that are distinctly different from @entity106 design			2
the image above right is a ground penetrating radar ( @entity28 ) image of the same area @entity112 from @entity113 reports that @entity114 , a research associate at @entity115 in @entity5 , came up with the idea to use @entity28 alongside @entity60 's map			1
analysts believe the differences in surface structure could indicate the creation of ditches that are different from those created by @entity124			2
a green and brown imagery photo examines the varying levels of sub-surface features			2
curved anomaly patterns are considered to be the work of @entity124 , while straight - line patterns are thought to be made be colonial settlers			1
the location of the colonial ground patterns in the modern images is the same as @entity60 's hidden fort on the 1585 map			1
it is a classic ' x-marks - the - spot ' map that could yet lead to historical treasure			2
riddle in invisible ink : the map ( left ) of @entity43 in @entity145 drawn by @entity60 during an attempt to create @entity10 's first colony reveals a hidden possible location for the settlement when it was illuminated from underneath ( right ) in recent tests			1
the colony disappeared in mysterious circumstances in the 1580s shedding new light : in this close - up of the patch at the centre of the map , a diamond or ' lozenge ' , the symbol for a fort , can clearly be seen			2
the symbol was drawn in invisible ink and further concealed with a piece of paper glued on top the ' invisible ink ' - a likely combination of milk , citrus juice or urine - was a common feature of maps at the time , often hiding places of strategic or military importance			2
for added security , the fort symbol was covered by another piece of paper glued over the top			2
researchers undertook a satellite survey of the site and looked for similarities between the old map and the current geography of the area			1
they are currently identifying where the spots on the map match today 's landscape , before systematically searching the site with their @entity28			1
step back in time : a graphic of the @entity5 coast shows the possible location of the ' @entity16 ' in relation to @entity43 , where @entity2 settlers established a colony in the 1580s hunting for historical answers : @entity199 uses the magnetometer at left while @entity202 at right teaches student @entity204 how the @entity28 machine measures and backdates disturbances underground 1584 : sir @entity67 's men first land on @entity43 and find it suitable for settlement			1
1585 : 108 soldiers come to @entity43 to establish first colony			2
1586 : colonists and native americans at ' war ' , and colony abandoned			0
1587 : second group of 117 colonists come to @entity43 1590 : captain @entity60 returns to @entity43 to find the colony gone			0
1602 : @entity219 makes another attempt to locate the colony			0
1940s : professional archaeology begins at @entity43			0
2012 : experts identify a tantalising clue hidden in a map drawn by settlement founder @entity60			1
2013 - researchers study the site with the help of magnetometers and @entity28			1
@entity28 works by sending a tiny pulse of energy into a material via an antenna			1
a computer then records the strength and time required for the return of any reflected signals			1
sub-surface variations from objects - such as wooden structures , iron cannons or coffins - will create reflections that are picked up by the system			0
using this technique , professor @entity114 and his colleagues found a previously undetected pattern that they claim may indicate the presence of one or more wooden structures under about a metre of soil			1
researchers claim the presence of the buried structure may indicate that there was some sort of colonial presence in the area			1
the @entity259 suggested the use of a proton magnetometer to enable the researchers to double - check their gpr findings , which can find objects buried about 13ft ( four metres ) underground			0
researchers are hopeful that it will only be a matter of time before they stumble on further clues to help explain what happened to the @entity16			0
seeing an opportunity : @entity272 wanted to use a colony in the ' @entity13 ' to launch raids against the @entity275 the @entity16 was an attempt by @entity272 to establish a permanent @entity2 presence in the @entity13 , and comprises two unsuccessful attempts at settlement			1
@entity272 's intention was to exlpoit the natural riches of the enexplored country , as well as using the colony as a base from which to launch privateering raids on @entity275 ships			0
the enterprise was originally financed and planned by sir @entity288 , but was later headed by @entity290 's half brother sir @entity67			0
an exploration mission led by @entity292 and @entity293 landed at @entity43 on july 4 , 1584 , and established good relations with the @entity296 and @entity19 tribes			0
@entity293 returned to @entity10 with members of the tribes , who told sir @entity67 about the local customs and geography			0
sir @entity67 ordered another mission in 1585 , led by his distant cousin sir @entity304			0
the expedition also included sir @entity67 's artist friend @entity60 , who was to provide invaluable coastal mapping of the region			0
sir @entity304 left 107 men to establish a fort and settlement on @entity43 , but within a year the colonists had managed to anger the local tribes , leading to open hostilities			0
when sir @entity316 stopped there in 1586 , after a successful raiding expedition to the @entity319 , he offered to provide passage for anyone who wanted to return to @entity10			0
when sir @entity304 returned with supplies to find the settlement abandoned , he left a small group to retain and @entity10 presence			1
sir @entity67 sent another expedition of 150 people in 1587 , let by @entity60			0
the only evidence they found of the small group left behind was a single skeleton			1
relations with the tribes had not improved and , after a settler was killed in @entity57 , @entity60 returned to @entity10 to ask for help and reinforcements			1
' croatoan ' : the return of @entity60 in 1590 found none of the 117 settlers of @entity43			1
the name of a local tribe was carved into a nearby tree - and there is no other evidence of where they went , or why			0
before he could return , @entity10 was plunged into the @entity348 and all vessels were comandeered to repel the coming @entity350			0
@entity60 was not able to return until 1590			0
his men could not find any trace of the 90 men , 17 women , and 11 children of the colony , nor was there any sign of a struggle or battle			0
before he left for @entity10 , @entity60 had arranged a code with the colonists			0
if they were under attack or forced to flee - a sensible arrangement considering relations with the locals - the colonists were to carve a @entity369 cross into a tree			0
there was no evidence of such a carved cross , but @entity60 's men found two trees			2
one was carved with the word ' @entity19 ' and the other simply with ' @entity377 '			0
whether this was a reference to the settlement 's assailants , or a indicator that the colonists had gone to live with the @entity19 on nearby @entity384 , remains unclear			0
poor weather and his shipmates ' desire to leave @entity43 forced @entity60 to abandon his search for the colonists			0
a voyage by sir @entity67 12 years later in 1602 also ended when bad weather forced the expedition to return to @entity10			0
sir @entity67 's arrest for treason prevented him from making any other expeditions .			0

a satellite survey of area around @entity57 has identified key areas of interest
*scientists* are searching these areas using ground penetrating radar ( @entity28 )
@entity28 measures the depth that signals travel before hitting a hidden object
so far , they have found a previously ' undetected pattern ' that they claim may indicate a former colonial presence in the area
