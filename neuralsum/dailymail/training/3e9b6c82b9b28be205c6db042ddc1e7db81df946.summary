the snarling , black - bearded mascot wearing a headscarf has been urging fans to root for the @entity9 team , in the desert town just east of @entity11 since the 1920s but @entity13 recently sent a letter to officials at the @entity16 asking them to get rid of the mascot - arguing that its ' large nose , heavy beard and @entity21 head covering ' is offensive			1
an anti-discriminating group wants @entity1 to remove this snarling , black - bearded mascot ' by allowing continued use of the term and imagery , you are commending and enforcing the negative stereotypes of an entire ethnic group , millions of whom are citizens of this nation , ' @entity23 , the group 's director of legal and policy affairs , wrote in the letter			1
the request comes amid mounting pressure for the @entity38 's @entity37 to change its mascot because it 's offensive to @entity40			2
the @entity21 mascot has been around since the 1920s and was chosen to recognize the area 's reliance on date farming , traditionally a @entity47 crop			1
the nearby community of @entity49 also pays homage to the @entity47			2
the mascot has evolved from a turban - wearing horseman carrying a lance to a standing figure with a scowl and a headscarf			1

' being an african - american from the @entity71 , i 'm sensitive to stereotyping , ' @entity65 told the newspaper			0
' but in this context , when this was created it was not meant in that way			0
it was totally an admiration of the connection with the @entity47			2
' @entity65 said the letter from the anti-discrimination group was the first time the school had been criticized for stereotyping in the past two years			2
some school alumni have defended the mascot , saying it 's a matter of pride			1
' there was no intention to demean @entity21 or be discriminatory in any way , ' said @entity92 , a 1961 graduate			0
' i do n't think it 's right to decide now that you ca n't do that anymore			0
it is political correctness run amok , i would say			0
