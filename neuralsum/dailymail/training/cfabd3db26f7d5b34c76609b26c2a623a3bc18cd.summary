by @entity0 published : 14:09 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 04:00 est , 11 april 2012 an internet troll sent a vile and threatening message to @entity4 mp @entity3 , ordering her to choose which of her children should die			2
@entity7 , 60 , used his computer to attack the mother of three , verbally abusing her and threatening her			1
in an email , he told mrs @entity3 that her computer and telephones had been hacked and that images of her family would be posted on the internet			2
@entity3 mp said the threats made her feel ' powerless and scared ' he then told the 40 - year - old @entity18 mp : ' you now have a @entity21 's choice			0
which kid is to go ? who will you choose ? ' the question is a reference to the harrowing film @entity21 in which a mother , played by @entity27 , is forced to choose which one of her two children will be sent to a gas chamber during the @entity31			0
the full text of the email contained numerous expletives and foul - mouthed insults , ordering mrs @entity3 to stop using @entity36 , where the mp has almost 50,000 followers			2
too offensive to print in full , an extract of @entity7 's message read : ' you have been hacked			1
' we are inside your computer all your phones , everywhere and inside your homes ! so get off twitter			0
' @entity7 claimed to be part of hacking group @entity47 , which has gained notoriety for defacing high - profile websites to spread political messages yesterday @entity7 was found guilty of sending mrs @entity3 an electronic message that was ' grossly offensive or of an indecent , offensive or menacing character '			1
he was convicted in his absence after failing to turn up at court for the third time			1
@entity57 has heard he claims to suffer from agoraphobia , a fear of open spaces			1
but after he declined to give evidence via videolink , district judge @entity61 proceeded without him			0
in a statement , mrs @entity3 – who did not attend the hearing – described her reaction to reading @entity7 's message while she was in @entity68			1
she said : ' i was more than 3,000 miles away from my children and i had no idea how to protect them			0
' i became extremely scared and called the @entity73			0
the mp and husband @entity75 , who were in @entity68 when the threats were sent in august			0
mrs @entity3 arranged police protection for family back in the @entity79 defiant : @entity3 sent this message to followers on @entity36 after the email turned up in her private inbox ' the police made immediate arrangements to ensure my family 's safety			1
' mrs @entity3 , who writes novels using her maiden name @entity90 , used her @entity36 account to tell followers she had reported the abuse to police			2
' had some morons threaten my children by email			0
to those who sent it ; get stuffed losers			0
' police traced the malicious email back to @entity7 's computer by tracking the ip address , a unique code assigned to every terminal			1
officers immediately went to @entity7 's squalid semi-detached home in @entity57 and took him to a police station for questioning			1
yesterday district judge @entity61 said he would sentence @entity7 in person next month			1
he warned that if @entity7 does not turn up for sentencing on may 8 , arrest would be inevitable			2
@entity115 , of the @entity116 , said after the hearing : ' the right to freedom of speech is accompanied by laws that protect individuals from those who seek to abuse that freedom and use the anonymity of email or @entity36 accounts to hide from the fear that they cause			0
he said that @entity7 had tried to use pseudonyms , ' thinking that he was safe from detection			2
this should be a salutary lesson for anyone who considers that they are above the law because they threaten others through a computer rather than on the streets			0

@entity7 , 60 , refused to attend court where he was found guilty in his absence of sending the menacing message
he claimed to be *affiliated* with *online* hacking groups @entity47 and @entity144
police traced the email to his squalid house in @entity57
