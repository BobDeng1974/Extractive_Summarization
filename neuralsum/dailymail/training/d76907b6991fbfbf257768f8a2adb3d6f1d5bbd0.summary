@entity0 has revealed he did n't sign @entity1 when he was @entity2 manager because the midfielder 's voicemail message was ' hi , it 's @entity1 - whazzup ! '			1
@entity1 at the time was struggling for playing time at @entity6 and @entity0 wanted to bring him to the @entity7 in a bid to boost his side 's performance			1
but @entity1 did n't answer @entity0 's call and the @entity12 changed his mind when he heard the player 's voicemail , based on the catchphrase from the @entity18 advert in the early 2000s			1
the @entity19 was struggling for game time at @entity6 when @entity0 enquired about signing him since his retirement from football the joker has appeared on shows like @entity26 's ' @entity25 ' in his new autobiography @entity27 , @entity0 explains : ' i rang @entity30			1
@entity1 [ @entity1 ] was n’t in the @entity6 team and i asked @entity30 if we could try to arrange a deal			2
' @entity34 said , " yeah , yeah he 's lost his way here but he could still do a job for you			0
" ' @entity1 's legs were going a bit but i thought he might come up to us [ at @entity2 ] with his long hair , and give us a lift – the way @entity45 [ @entity46 ] had , a big personality in the dressing room			2
' @entity34 gave me permission to give him a call			0
so i got @entity1 's mobile number and rang him			0
' it went to his voicemail , " hi it ’s @entity1 – whazzup ! " like the @entity18 ad			1
the midfielder had successful spells at @entity57 and @entity58 , where he ended his career @entity1 now plies his trade as a television pundit on @entity26 's flagship football show , @entity62 ' i never called him back			0
i thought : " i ca n’t be f * * * ing signing that			0
” ’ @entity0 's objection was possibly not only to the puerile message but also the fact that , by the time he heard the message , it was years out of date			2
responding on @entity70 , @entity1 said : ' oh come on @entity71 ! ! ! ! hahahaha			1
' whether or not @entity0 did try and sign me i chose derby over @entity2 as they offered me more and i did n't want to move house ! ! ' but it 's great to know @entity0 obviously liked me as a player as he was one of best midfielders ever ! ! # whatssuppppppp			1
' @entity1 then took to the social media site to offer his fans a prize - winning opportunity : ' whats the funniest thing you 've heard on answer phone messege [ sic ] best one i 'll give a signed golf shoe by me.scholesy , vaughny @entity88 '			0
