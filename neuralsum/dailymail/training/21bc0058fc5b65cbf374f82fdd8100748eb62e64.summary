by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:57 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 29 september 2013 @entity3 could pull out of the controversial @entity4 which stops dangerous terrorists from being ‘ chucked out ’ of the @entity3 , @entity2 said today			1
for the first time the prime minister revealed he was ready to end the right of foreign courts to interfere with @entity3 justice			1
he said cutting ties with the @entity13 courts could be the only way to ensure a future @entity16 government can keep the people of @entity3 safe			1
threat : @entity2 said he would do whatever it takes to keep @entity3 safe , including leaving the @entity4			1
he is pictured on @entity21 's @entity20 with @entity24 band @entity22 controversial : @entity3 may pull away from the @entity25 in @entity26 schools , courthouses and immigration centres should be free to ban religious veils , @entity2 said			1
the prime minister said he did not believe there should be a general ban on wearing the niqab - which conceals the whole face - in the streets			1
but he made clear he was ' happy ' to look at the issue of whether the state needed to do more to back up institutions which choose to implement a ban			2
mr @entity2 told @entity21 's @entity20 : ' we are a free country and people should be free to wear whatever clothes they like in public or in private			2
' but we should support those institutions that need to put in place rules so that those institutions can work properly			2
' so for instance in a school , if they want that particular dress code , i believe the government should back them			0
the same for courts , the same for immigration			2
' i think we should back those institutions that want to have sensible policies that actually have a particular purpose			0
' the @entity4 has been responsible for deeply controversial decisions including repeatedly blocking the deportation of radical cleric @entity62 and insisting offenders in @entity3 prisons should have the right to vote			1
home secretary @entity67 and justice secretary @entity68 have both argued that leaving the @entity4 is the only way to give @entity3 control of its laws , without dangerous criminals and terrorists being able to appeal to @entity75 courts			1
mr @entity2 said the @entity3 could start by scrapping the @entity76 , and replacing it with a @entity77			1
but he suggested he was now ready to go further			0
asked if he backed @entity16 mps who want the @entity3 to leave the @entity4 , mr @entity2 replied : ‘ it may be that that is where we end up			1
’ the prime minister said he wanted to ‘ think about what is the outcome we want ’ rather than focus on conventions the @entity3 remains signed up to			1
he told @entity21 ’s @entity20 : ‘ as prime minister i want to know can i keep our country safe			1
‘ so for instance are we able to chuck out of our country people who have no right to be here , who threaten our country , i say we should be able to do that			0
‘ now , whatever that takes we must deliver that outcome			0
that ’s what i think we have the next 20 months to do and put into our manifesto whatever measures need to be taken so we can get the effect we want which is basically to have greater ability to keep our people safe			2
‘ there are a range of options			0
you can write a @entity3 @entity77 so that when cases go to the @entity4 you have a proper margin appreciation			1
‘ the judges there can say well the @entity3 have got their own @entity77 , they have made they own decision and we should respect that			1
‘ that is one possibility			0
but we have some time now to get this right before the manifesto			0
’ ‘ but people should be in no doubt that under a @entity16 - only government led by me , there will be the ability to throw out of this country far more rapidly people who threaten us and our way of life			0
’ block : the @entity4 repeatedly blocked attempts by the @entity3 government to deport hate cleric @entity62 out : home secretary @entity67 finally succeeded in deporting @entity62 in july after a decade - long legal battle the @entity4 was set up after the @entity129 to prevent torture and human rights abuses			1
the court was established in 1959 , giving complainants direct access to justice at a @entity75 level			2
but critics say the court has grown out of all proportion , and its judges do not even need to have any judicial experience in their homeland			0
in theory , the @entity141 , a body with 47 member states which oversees the @entity26 court , could retaliate against mrs may by expelling @entity3			1
but this has not happened to other countries found guilty of flouting human rights laws in the past			0
opposition to the @entity4 in @entity3 has been fuelled by a series of high - profile cases			1
the court wants to see tens of thousands of prisoners , including murderers and rapists , being given the vote , regardless of the offence that they have committed			2
its ruling , in defiance of a 100 - year ban on votes for prisoners in the @entity3 , came after the @entity4 backed a complaint by @entity167 , a convicted axe killer			1
@entity2 has denied claims that he regretted his decision to put same - sex marriage into law			0
a new book about the coalition government has suggested that mr @entity2 had told allies he would not have gone ahead with the reform if he had known how fierce opposition would be from conservative mps			0
the prime minister admitted he was surprised by the level of anger provoked in his own party 's ranks by gay marriage , but insisted he was glad to have introduced the change			1
furore : @entity2 admitted he did not predict the public backlash against his plans for same - sex marriages mr @entity2 was speaking after the publication in the @entity189 of an excerpt from @entity192 's book in it together , suggesting that mr @entity2 told an ally : ' if i 'd known what it was going to be like , i would n't have done it			0
' the @entity178 told @entity21 's @entity20 : ' i do n't regret it			2
@entity3 is a more equal and fairer country for having done it			2
' it 's certainly true to say that this is an important change			0
i do n't think i expected quite the furore that there was			0
it 's clearly been very difficult for some people to take on , and i completely understand and respect that			0
' i 'm not sure perhaps at the beginning we got across to people that this was about marriages that could take place in registry offices , that this was not going to change what happened in church , mosques or synagogues			0
' he added : ' i am passionate about marriage			0
i think it 's a great institution , and i think it should be available to people who are gay as well as those of us who are n't			0
