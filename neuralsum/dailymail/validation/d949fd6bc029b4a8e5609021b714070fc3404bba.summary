@entity0 lost his quarter - final clash with @entity2 in @entity3 but believes his performance showed he is getting back to his best			1
the defeat meant @entity0 missed the chance of joining @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 in the semi-finals for the first time since the @entity12			2
but , after @entity2 saved three match points to spring the shock , the @entity13 admitted : ‘ i ’m leaving @entity3 with the feeling that i had a big chance to do more and with the feeling that i was ready to compete again well			1
@entity0 believes he 's closing in on being back to his best after a promising @entity3 @entity21 display ‘ i think a match like this obviously is much better if you win but , even losing , i ’m 90 per cent sure that will help me			1
’ the three - time @entity3 winner added : ‘ it ’s true that i did n’t compete at that level of intensity mentally in tennis for a long time			2
‘ i was able to be very focused , playing with positive energy for three hours , so that ’s great news for me , because that ’s the way i competed during all of my career			0
’ @entity2 upset the @entity13 and saved three match points in the process of winning the clash @entity38 looked like he might be heading out after losing the first set inside 36 minutes , but he rallied to save three match points in an epic second - set tie - break , forcing a deciding set			1
the sixth seed , who fired 19 aces and also saved six break points , finally ended @entity0 ’s perfect record against @entity46 by earning a break in the third and clinching a 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 7 - 5 victory			1
after his first win over @entity0 , @entity2 said : ‘ at the moments when i was playing those match points , it did n’t really feel like match points			1
@entity0 has had an injury hit 18 months but now looks to come back stronger and hopes to win more titles ‘ it was just like another point that i was trying to get through , sort of going through the paces at that moment of what i need to do , not really signifying it as a match point			1
‘ it ’s really great what i was able to do today and i ’m very happy with it but i do n’t let myself get caught up because this is n’t where it ends			0
there is a lot more to achieve			0
’ it does not get any easier for @entity2 , with @entity8 his semi-final opponent			2
the @entity74 master reached the last four with a routine 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 victory over @entity76			0
the impressive @entity46 progresses to the semi-finals as his reputation continues to grow he had 21 winners , equalling the number of unforced errors by @entity76 , won 13 of 14 points at the net , never faced a break point on his serve and broke @entity76 four times in the match , including three times in the second set			2
a clearly delighted @entity8 said : ‘ it ’s not just another win but another win against a top 10 player — against @entity76 , who has played me tough in recent years			0
i was really able to utilise the court much more , play more angles , play with variation , spin and slice			0
i did that very well			0
‘ because i was serving well and moving well , so maybe there is not going to be that many chances for him on the return			0
