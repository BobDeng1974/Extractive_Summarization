by @entity0 finding extraterrestrial signals has been dreamed about for decades			1
but a researcher from the @entity3 in @entity4 says we should n’t be looking - because we ’re not ready to meet aliens			1
@entity7 revealed to @entity8 how his survey of students showed the general level of ignorance and influence of religion would leave us shocked if we made first contact			2
a study by professor @entity7 from the @entity3 in @entity4 claims that we 're not ready to make first contact			1
he claims we 're not prepared mentally or ethically to meet beings unlike ourselves and we should try to improve our ' global consciousness ' since 1984 the @entity20 has been looking for signs of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe			1
of the 116 students ... 72.8 % believe that demons and angels exist			1
33.7 % do n't think humans are the origin of global warming			2
82.1 % think it is important to have a space agency			0
71.4 % think the military should have the main role in the event of contact with an alien civilisation			0
80 % believe if we find aliens more advanced than us they will try to conquer us			0
78 % believe there is a chance we 've been visited by aliens in the past			0
to date nothing has been found , although the search continues unabated			2
members of the project are now going further by sending out messages from @entity49 ( @entity50 ) to try and contact other lifeforms			2
but @entity7 , a professor in the @entity52 at the @entity3 and participant in previous projects such as @entity56 ’s @entity55 ( a simulated mission to @entity58 on @entity49 ) , has carried out a study that he claims indicates we are not ready to make contact			1
in the study he sent a questionnaire to 116 students in @entity4 , the @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity7 tells @entity8 he used students because they ‘ will be the future politicians , scientists , the people in charge , so i wanted to know what their knowledge was			2
’ the @entity20 ( @entity74 ) @entity73 was established in 1984			0
since then it has used a number of observatories around the world , like the @entity79 ( pictured ) , to try and find alien signals from another world , but so far nothing has been found the questions were split into five sections : religious beliefs , the environment , space - related knowledge , their daily activities and their opinions on life issues			1
‘ in all those areas i defined a different type of question based on other studies that i think related to @entity50 research , ’ @entity7 says			0
these included questions such as how likely they thought life was to exist on other planets , what year man first walked on the moon and what the largest planet in the solar system is			0
the results were somewhat disconcerting for @entity7			0
for example only 82 per cent of the students knew the first moon landing was in 1969			0
‘ the conclusions were that scientific knowledge , especially the knowledge related to space among college students , is not good , ’ he continues			2
‘ so i think space agencies should increase education efforts			0
' another conclusion by @entity7 was that religious beliefs seem to be very strong in general			1
while not necessarily a problem , he says this may influence the opinions of people facing major events in future such as making first contact			0
on 16 november 1974 the @entity127 radio telescope in @entity128 ( pictured ) was used to send out a signal called the @entity127 message , a ' calling card ' from @entity49 to potential alien races			2
however @entity7 says we should n't perform ' @entity50 ' like this as we are n't ready to make contact but ultimately it is our lack of appreciation for our own planet and our place in the universe that would be our downfall , he says			1
‘ we ’re not ready to talk to extraterrestrials because global consciousness is not developed enough in the population , ' he concludes			1
‘ people have daily life problems and the government does n’t pay attention to global issues like the planet and the environment			1
‘ that makes us a species too focused on daily life problems , we do n’t have an awareness of our surroundings			1
‘ it ’s like when a meteor falls in some place on the planet , it ’s big news			0
but that ’s a regular real possibility			0
‘ if we have a more global consciousness about our situation on the planet , how fragile the planet is , maybe that ’s a step in the evolution of our consciousness as a species			1
‘ there could be other intelligent life out there and it could be really different from us physically , mentally , socially and even morally			0
‘ they could maybe not even be biological , they could be robots			0
‘ right now i do n’t think as a species we are ready			0
‘ of course some people are ready , but as a species i think it would be a big shock			1

a professor from @entity4 says we 're not ready to meet extraterrestrial life
@entity186 surveyed 116 students from the @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity4
he found that many had a lack of knowledge in a number of areas
they also had religious beliefs that would make finding @entity198 a ' big shock '
we also focus too much on daily problems than bigger things like @entity49
he concludes we need to improve our ' global consciousness '
