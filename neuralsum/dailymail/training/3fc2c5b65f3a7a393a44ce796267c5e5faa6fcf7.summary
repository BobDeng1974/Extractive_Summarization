by @entity0 published : 12:24 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 1 may 2013 snorers who sleep more than nine hours a night are twice as likely to develop bowel cancer than snorers who get seven hours of sleep a night , according to new research			1
the study showed a significant link between long periods of sleep and the development of colorectal cancer , especially among people who are overweight or who snore			2
as a result , it is believed that obstructive sleep apnoea – the a form of snoring that causes interrupted breathing during sleep – could contribute to an increased risk of cancer			1
according to the @entity24 study , snoring is n't just annoying it poses serious risks to a person 's health this is because people with sleep apnoea snore and tend to sleep for longer because their sleep is disrupted , making them more tired			1
‘ our current study adds to the very limited literature regarding the relationship between sleep duration , sleep quality and colorectal cancer risk , ’ said lead author dr @entity32 , of the @entity33 at @entity34			0
‘ the novel observation of increased risk among regular snorers who sleep for long periods raises the possibility that sleep apnoea and its intermittent [ oxygen deprivation ] may contribute to cancer risk			1
’ the researchers asked participants to estimate their total hours of sleep in a 24 - hour period and asked them if they snore			0
of 76,368 women and 30,121 men the researchers documented a total of 1,973 cases of colorectal cancer			0
they broke the participants into subgroups which showed that men and women who were overweight , or who were regular snorers , and who reported sleeping nine hours or more per day , had a 1.4 to 2-fold increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to overweight people , or snorers , who got seven hours sleep a day			1
the general recommendation is that most adults should get about seven to eight hours of sleep a night			0
the authors suggest that the association between long sleep duration and colorectal cancer may be explained by obstructive sleep apnoea , which involves repetitive episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep			1
sleep apnoea , a dangerous form of snoring , causes tiredness which could explain why some snorers in the study slept too much the most common cause of obstructive sleep apnoea is excess body weight , and loud snoring is a common symptom of the condition			1
the researchers believe that sleep disruption caused by sleep apnoea may reduce sleep quality and increase sleepiness , resulting in longer reported sleep durations			0
in addition to this , intermittent oxygen deprivation , similar to that which occurs in people with sleep apnoea , has been shown in animal models to promote tumour growth			2
‘ future studies should focus on different populations and evaluate to see whether sleep duration and sleep quality is a novel risk factor for colorectal cancer and to understand the mechanisms behind this association , ’ said dr @entity32			0
other recent research has shown that people who sleep for less than six hours a night are at a significantly increased risk of stroke			2
researchers at the @entity117 found that those in middle age who skimped on sleep were more likely to suffer stroke symptoms than those who got at least nine hours of shut - eye – even if they were a healthy weight and with no family history of stroke			0
the scientists found that sleep apnea made the problem worse as it reduced the quality of people ’s sleep .			0

@entity24 study found that snorers who slept more than 9 hours were at a significantly *higher* risk of cancer
*experts* say sleep apnoea - snoring with interrupted breathing - plays a role because it makes people tired
