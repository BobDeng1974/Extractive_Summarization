@entity1 would likely be selling coffee out of a van on the sandy - coloured streets of @entity5 , in southern @entity6 , with his father @entity7 had he not met @entity8 in 2007			1
if he had listened to his mother he may not even have been a footballer - she wanted him to become a professional dancer			2
at the age of 13 he was @entity6 's latin - @entity13 dance champion , partnering his older sister @entity14			1
his father wanted him to play football and he choose that route instead			0
but it has been far from a straightforward one			0
but then @entity41 , in charge at @entity23 , brought a 22 - year - old @entity1 over to @entity24 and while he was still not prolific in front of goal he helped them win the @entity45 in 2009 during a four - year spell			2
@entity41 is renowned for his faith in young players and it was for that reason that @entity1 decided to leave his native @entity6 to try elsewhere			1
the @entity38 forward has been a huge success at @entity26 , scoring five goals in his first eight games the 29 - year - old poses with his september premier league player of the month award at @entity57 's @entity20 praises @entity1 impact 2005 - 06 : @entity5 , 10 apps , 0 goals 2005 - 06 : @entity62 17 apps , six goals 2006 - 07 : @entity64 , 37 apps , 10 goals 2007 - 08 : @entity23 , 27 apps , three goals 2008 - 09 : @entity23 , 20 apps , three goals 2009 - 10 : @entity23 , 13 apps , two goals 2010 - 11 : @entity23 , 18 apps , six goals 2011 - 12 : @entity74 , 11 apps , one goal 2011 - 12 : @entity77 , 16 apps , one goal 2012 - 13 : @entity74 , one app , 0 goals 2012 - 13 : @entity82 , 29 apps , 27 goals 2013 - 14 : @entity82 28 apps , 23 goals ' if he 'd never met the @entity90 guru [ @entity41 ] , as well as @entity91 , maybe my son would now be a carpenter or he 'd be sitting with me in my van , selling coffee , ' said @entity1 's father in an interview with @entity96			1
@entity1 had managed just 16 goals in two seasons in @entity6 , but the move to @entity24 is considered to have launched his career – and it is where he was given his ' @entity103 ' nickname , which needs little explaining			1
but if the @entity106 manager is to take the plaudits for introducing @entity1 to the @entity90 league , it is @entity20 who must be given credit for sculpting him into the fearsome goalscorer he has become			2
@entity1 has been a very late developer in the game when it comes to finding the net			0
after @entity23 he returned to try his hand in @entity6 once more , this time for @entity74 , but was again frustrated and loaned out first to @entity77 before @entity20 – at this point in charge at @entity82 – took him on loan in 2012			0
@entity1 scored 50 goals in 57 games for @entity90 side @entity82 before @entity26 paid £ 8million for him @entity91 must also be given some credit for developing @entity1 both at @entity82 and @entity26 it was then , just two years ago , that everything clicked into place			1
@entity1 netted 11 times in his first 10 games , had agreed a deal to make the move permanent by january and ended the season as the @entity45 's second top - scorer with 27 goals			1
during his two seasons in @entity24 he scored 50 goals in 57 league games before @entity20 took @entity1 with him to @entity26 for £ 8million			1
five goals in his first eight @entity26 games finally earned him a first call - up to the national team , at the age of 29 , by @entity6 manager @entity140 , where he scored the winner against @entity28			1
despite numerous attempts to prove himself in his native country , @entity1 always struggled in @entity146 @entity1 is modelling himself on @entity147 , a similarly powerful forward who also blossomed late in his career ' finally somebody has noticed that there was an @entity38 who scored 64 goals [ in all competitions ] in @entity24 , ' @entity7 added			2
' it 's going to be good fun with @entity140			0
@entity1 has confided in me that he sees a lot of @entity41 in him			0
' after the match , presenter @entity159 , on @entity38 tv channel @entity158 , introduced him as a 39 - year - old by accident			2
@entity1 responded to questions about his age with , ' better late than never			0
' he is looking to @entity147 , similar in his powerful forward play and in developing late , as inspiration and wants to win as much as he did			0
@entity147 , who lead the line for @entity6 between 2004 and 2009 , has the 2006 @entity168 plus @entity170 trophies to his name			0
' @entity172 can wait , ' @entity1 added to @entity173 , with a smile .			0

@entity1 could have sold coffee for a living or been a dancer
the @entity38 's father said @entity8 was *crucial* to his son 's success
@entity184 also credited @entity91 in his development
@entity1 's success at @entity26 earned him an @entity6 call - up
he also received @entity191 player of the month award for september
