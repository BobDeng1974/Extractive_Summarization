the @entity0 has announced plans to fly its own drones in restricted airspace over @entity4 the agency , which has been hit by a number of recent high profile security breaches into the @entity9 grounds , has declined to say what the flights are for , nor specifically when they will occur			1
but experts have speculated that the @entity0 has developed drones that can be used as surveillance against unmanned aerial vehicles which violate @entity9 airspace but stopped short of saying they now possess weaponized @entity18			1
alert : @entity0 officers search the south grounds of the @entity9 on january 26 after an unmanned drone piloted by a drunk government employee crash landed on the lawn in january , the agency was embarrassed when a small drone piloted by a drunk government employee crash landed onto the @entity9 lawn and recently @entity29 has been unnerved by a spate of drones seen buzzing the @entity32 , the @entity33 and other key city landmarks			1
the january episode highlighted a serious security gap that the @entity0 has so far been unable to plug - how to combat the threat of drones flown over the nation 's capital and specifically against the @entity9			1
the @entity0 , in conjunction with other inter-agency partners , will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems , in the coming days and weeks			2
because these exercises will be conducted within the normally flight restricted areas in the @entity4 area , they have been carefully planned and will be tightly controlled			0
in preparation for these exercises the @entity0 has coordinated with all appropriate federal , state and local agencies			2
however , some aviation and security experts have expressed concern about the scope of the @entity0 's use of drones			1
@entity61 , executive director of the @entity62 told the @entity63 he thinks that the flights are firstly a public relations exercise designed to restore confidence but he is worried about what the agency will do with all the surveillance material it collects			2
' the beauty of their exercise is they get to do real - world outdoor operations that will promote safety for the @entity9 , for monuments and for the general public , ' said @entity61			2
' ( but ) if the @entity0 uses it inappropriately , i ’d be the first to say they have to stop that , ” he said			0
“ they ’re going to have to disclose what they intend to do at some point , because that ’s exactly what it says in the executive order			0
agencies have to be transparent			0
' the executive order was issued by president @entity93 in february and governs how any federal agencies using drones keep information gathered			0
all agencies wishing to use drones must publish their own guidelines on keeping and gathering the information so that people 's privacy is not violated			0
found : the recreational drone that landed on the @entity103 is seen in this @entity0 handout prevalent : the @entity0 has become increasingly worried about the threat of armed drones and the safety of the president ' beyond using it for ways that are invasive to consumer privacy , which they should not do , if they are using it to protect grounds in @entity4 that are restricted , i ’m for it , ' said @entity61			1
@entity0 spokeswoman @entity118 issued a 76 - word statement to announce the flights , which leads some to believe they are ready to deploy operational drones to combat any threats to the president and his family			1
' they ’re testing it in the field , as opposed to just testing it at a research station , ' said @entity131 , head of the unmanned aircraft systems practice at the @entity134 law firm of @entity135			0
' that might suggest that they are closer to an actual functional defense mechanism than the public might think			0

@entity0 released 76 - word statement signaling the test flights
would not say when the flights will take place or what the drones *capabilities* are
@entity0 has become increasingly worried about the threat to president from @entity18
