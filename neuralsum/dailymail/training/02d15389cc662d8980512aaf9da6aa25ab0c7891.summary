a woman whose eleven - month - old daughter was raped and killed by her then - boyfriend in 1997 does not want the @entity4 man responsible to be executed , it has emerged			1
@entity6 said death row inmate @entity7 should instead spend the rest of his life behind bars in a recent interview with @entity12			1
' if they truly want to honor me , then they will do away with the death penalty for him , and they will give him life in prison without the possibility of parole , because that 's the only thing that 's gon na honor me , ' she told the affiliate station			2
' i can only see him spending the rest of his life in prison and dying in prison , without him ever walking out of those cell walls			0
he was prosecuted by @entity43 assistant district attorney @entity42 that year , as well as in 2002 and 2003 , according to the affiliate station			0
@entity42 told @entity12 ' @entity7 was convicted twice by juries and given the death penalty each time and given 75 years for the sexual assault			1
' @entity42 also said of @entity7 ' this person does n’t deserve to live			0
if you ’re going to have a death penalty , if there are going to be some crimes , some homicides , that are so atrocious ... then the rape and the brutal murder of a child has to qualify			2

death row inmate : @entity7 's execution is planned for this january she told @entity12 ' i do n't see any justice in just sentencing someone to die			1
to me , the justice is in someone living with what they have done to you , to your family , and having to live with that for the rest of their life , knowing that they 'll never walk out those bars			2
' @entity81 legal director @entity80 supported @entity83 's views , telling the affiliate station ' i think she hits it right on the head when she says you know what , this person took life , this person murdered			1
now we ’re just doing the same thing in my baby ’s name			0
speaking about the death penalty , @entity83 also told @entity12 ' that would dishonor my daughter ; it would dishonor me and everything and i believe in			1
um , i would n't want to have to know about something like that because i would n't want to know that my hand or what i went through personally is the reason why he 's no longer living			0
when he dies , i want it to be because it 's his time , not because he 's been executed due to what happened to me and my child			0
' and i do n't want that on my hands			0
i makes me feel like i 'm no different than him , and i do n't want to feel that way			0
