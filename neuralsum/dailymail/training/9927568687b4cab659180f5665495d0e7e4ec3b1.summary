you say potato by @entity1 and @entity2 @entity4 is known for his heavy @entity6 accent in 1997 , a hundred students were asked to listen to what they believed were tapes of the police interviewing various suspects — in fact , everyone concerned was an actor			1
the people playing the suspects either spoke in @entity15 — @entity17 @entity16 — or with @entity6 accents			1
the students were then asked to say if they thought the suspects were guilty or innocent			2
it turned out they were twice as likely to convict someone who spoke with a @entity23 accent			2
the reason was simple : the @entity23 , they reckoned , ‘ sounded guilty ’			2
somehow , i suspect that this wo n’t come as that great a surprise to anyone who does n’t actually hail from @entity6			1
the flattened vowels , the aggrieved uplift at the end of each sentence			0
surely anyone who talks like this must have something to hide ? but just a year after the experiment , a nightclub owner in @entity37 took out adverts in @entity6 papers for staff			1
why ? because his clients could n’t get enough of the accent			1
they thought it sounded cool and sexy			1
what ’s going on here ? why do accents sound different to different people ? and , more to the point , why do we speak with accents at all ? the reasons , @entity1 and his father @entity52 believe , go back a long way			1
trying to work out someone ’s identity in the dark would have been a critical business for early humans			2
if you were sitting in a cave and you heard voices outside , you would want to know if they belonged to friends or foes			0
if they spoke the same way as you , it was probably safe to go out			2
if not , you ’d best sit tight and keep your hands fastened around that club			0
accents , of course , say an awful lot about us			0
they proclaim where we ’re from , what class we belong to , our ethnic origins , even our educational history			0
they ’re also something we judge people on — and our judgments tend to be as swift as they are unforgiving			0
yet it does n’t explain why @entity6 should be synonymous with shifty			1
in the @entity87 there was no such thing as @entity15 ; everyone spoke with a regional accent			1
@entity15 , as it ’s known , was a reaction against @entity93			1
but @entity23 can console themselves with the fact that though they regularly come top of polls to find the most unattractive accent in the @entity99 , when it comes to sounding bolshy , @entity95 stands supreme			2
talking posh turns out to be a comparatively recent invention			0
in the @entity87 there was no such thing as @entity15 ; everyone spoke with a regional accent			1
@entity15 , as it ’s known , was a reaction against @entity93			1
essentially , it was everything @entity93 was n’t			1
if @entity93 dropped their h ’s , polite society would n’t			1
if @entity93 put an h in a sentence where it did n’t belong — ‘ i broke my harm ’ — polite society took it out again			1
skip forward 500 years and the wheel has come full circle			0
in the @entity121 , people began to talk in @entity122 — the result of @entity124 moving up in the world and wanting to sound less @entity126			0
what they ended up with was a weird amalgam of @entity93 and @entity15			1
as accents multiplied , so people became more and more adept at identifying them			0
@entity132 based professor @entity131 in @entity131 — who claimed to be able to place a person ’s origins within six miles , and sometimes within two streets in @entity136 — on a real - life professor of phonetics at @entity139 , @entity136			2
it was only a matter of time before phonetics went into showbusiness			0
in the @entity145 , a radio series went out in the @entity146 called where are you from ? in which a man called @entity150 would try to identify people ’s accents			2
guests were given a list of 20 words to say , including ‘ very ’ , ‘ wash ’ and ‘ greasy ’			0
@entity150 regularly got seven out of ten correct			0
@entity2 is honorary professor of linguistics at the @entity158 , and @entity1 is an actor who curated the @entity160 ’s cd , @entity162 ’s @entity161			1
for some reason — presumably because they thought it would make everything sound bright and snappy — their narrative keeps switching from one to the other , with cheery little sign - offs such as : ‘ over to you @entity170			2
’ although this works surprisingly well at first , it soon runs out of steam			0
yet there is still a lot of fascinating stuff here			0
plainly , we ’re all obsessed by how we speak , even if — thanks to @entity179 — we ’re increasingly shifting westwards			0
how many people now say ‘ skedule ’ instead of ‘ schedule ’ ? linguist @entity2 ( left ) and his son @entity1 ( right ) explore why we 're obsessed with how we speak at the same time , attitudes to @entity15 are changing			1
once it was the embodiment of decency and trustworthiness			0
now it ’s more likely to be seen as ‘ distant ’ and ‘ customer unfriendly ’			0
some things , though , never change : snobbery and a desire to escape one ’s background being two of them			0
in 2012 , a @entity99 private tuition company announced it received far more requests for elocution lessons than any other subject			0
so if you happen to be sitting on a bus on , say , the @entity6 inner ring road and hear someone reciting ‘ how now brown cow ’ over and over , do n’t judge them too harshly : they ’re only following a natural human impulse .			1
