@entity1 mp @entity0 has been told off by the party ’s high command for poking fun at @entity6 ’s two kitchens			1
mr @entity0 , 80 , who is standing down as an mp in may , last week mischievously tweeted a picture of his own kitchen – complete with an unpacked bag of shopping and half - full glass of wine on the table – under the heading ‘ this is what a real @entity1 kitchen looks like ’			1
yesterday he was sent a rebuke by @entity18 , the shadow solicitor general , for the ‘ attack ’ on the party leader , warning him ‘ if you ca n’t say anything supportive , keep your opinion to yourself ’			0
@entity0 tweeted this photograph with the caption : ' this is what a real @entity1 kitchen looks like ' it is just the latest twist in the drama about mr @entity6 ’s domestic set - up after he and wife @entity33 were filmed for a @entity35 interview having tea in a very small , empty kitchen with no seating area			1
in response to criticism , a family friend tweeted that the kitchen in the @entity43 ’ £ 2million @entity45 townhouse was ‘ lovely ’ and that this was a ‘ functional kitchenette ’ for making ‘ tea and snacks ’			1
while most @entity48 have resisted comment on the issue , mr @entity0 fuelled the fire this weekend by tweeting : ‘ @entity1 ’s new pledge card promises two kitchens for all by 2030 , two toilets by 2035			1
’ last week , in a jibe at the @entity56 ’ so - called bedroom tax , the veteran mp for @entity58 , had said : ‘ @entity59 to introduce spare kitchen tax ’			1
mr @entity18 wrote him a letter , which mr @entity0 duly published on his website yesterday , which read : ‘ you ’re a joke @entity64			1
it ’s very sad to see it but it ’s becoming increasingly apparent			0
you think it clever to attack us			0
' it ’s not clever and you ’ve had plenty out of the party			0
‘ i am reluctant to pull you up publicly because you love the attention so very much			0
if you ca n’t say anything supportive just keep your opinion to yourself			0
' we need to retain @entity58			0
you ’ve done little to help with that			0
and i doubt you ’ve ever had a kitchen in @entity58			0
’ it is just the latest twist in the drama about mr @entity6 ’s domestic set - up after he and wife @entity33 were filmed for a @entity35 interview having tea in a very small , empty kitchen with no seating area mr @entity18 , the mp for @entity87 , added that mr @entity6 ‘ has one in @entity88 [ his constituency in @entity90 ] and mine ’s massive in @entity92			1
’ it is a reference to @entity48 ’ thinking that mr @entity0 has done little to help them campaign to keep the seat			2
it is the only @entity1 seat in the country which pollsters believe @entity99 has a chance of winning			2
the veteran mp , who is an outspoken @entity102 , has also infuriated the leadership by claiming in a recent article that his party was promoting too many young women			2
he said @entity1 , which has used all - women shortlists to boost their numbers of female mps , was ‘ undergoing the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink @entity111 soap promised to make us look a little lovelier every day			2
’ mr @entity0 claimed that as a result , @entity1 was becoming more ‘ family - friendly , gentler ’ but ‘ less prepared for all - night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind ’			1
he also claimed that ‘ ageism is rampant ’ in the party , and that while he was standing down because ‘ i ’d rather not die in public ’ other @entity48 over 60 , were being ‘ carried out kicking and screaming ’ .			0
