@entity0 has prompted outrage by becoming the first @entity3 country to ban visitors from ebola - hit areas of @entity6 , amid warnings the restrictions could make it harder to fight the deadly disease			1
in a dramatic move announced today , the government said it would refuse entry to anyone travelling from @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 - the countries most severely hit by the epidemic - despite there being no known cases of the virus in @entity0			1
but a @entity24 official condemned the ban , describing it as ' counter-productive ' and ' too draconian '			1
the unprecedented moves comes amid calls from @entity43 for a travel ban to be imposed in the @entity46 - something which has so far been resisted by @entity47			1
announcing the decision , immigration minister @entity27 told @entity49 the government 's processes were ' working to protect @entity0 '			1
under the strict regime , @entity0 will not issue new visas and will cancel temporary ones			0
those with permanent @entity0 visas yet to arrive in the country will only be allowed to fly after a 21 - day quarantine before their departure			2
mr @entity27 also announced the government would be suspending its humanitarian programme in the affected countries			0
@entity40 has killed almost half of more than 10,000 people who have been diagnosed with the disease			1
the @entity67 has warned the actual death toll is a lot higher			0
but public health officials have urged against travel bans , warning it could leave the stricken countries further isolated from international aid			0
they also warn it would not entirely prevent people in ebola - hit areas from entering other countries			0
critics say the move will prevent the stricken countries from getting the international aid they need to recover from the epidemic			0

he said that measures at @entity24 's @entity93 airport had successfully prevented anyone flying out of the country with @entity40			1
he said : ' it is discriminatory in that ... it is not ( going ) after @entity40 but rather it is ... against the 24 million citizens of @entity24 , @entity16 and @entity15			1
certainly , it is not the right way to go			0
' this measure by the @entity0 government is absolutely counterproductive			0
' @entity105 , head of the @entity106 ( @entity107 ) , added : ' anything that will dissuade foreign trained personnel from coming here to @entity6 and joining us on the frontline to fight the fight would be very , very unfortunate			0
' @entity47 has so far resisted calls for a similar ban to be implemented on @entity46 borders @entity118 ( @entity118 ) president @entity117 also told @entity119 : ' it 's not necessarily a very well - focused decision			1
' the bigger picture needs to be on our preparedness at home but more importantly our involvement in @entity6 itself , putting doctors and nurses and other logistical elements in place and trying to combat the crisis there			0
' after the annoucement , @entity16 's president @entity134 urged @entity0 to reconsider its travel ban			1
she said : ' anytime there 's stigmatisation , there 's quarantine , there 's exclusion of people , many of whom are just normal , then those of us who are fighting this epidemic , when we face that , we get very sad			2
' prime minister @entity148 has previously refused to send @entity0 medical teams to help battle the epidemic in @entity6 , until it has guarantees that any @entity0 who becomes infected received adequate medical treatment			2
he said he was ' carefully considering ' requests from the @entity46 and @entity155 to follow their lead and send workers			0
airport checks have identified more than 800 people who entered @entity0 from @entity6 and who could have been in ebola - stricken areas			2
but none have required a hospital visit after arriving			0
meanwhile , the growing paranoia in the @entity46 has fuelled calls to impose a travel ban and has become a bone of political contention			1
prominent @entity43 have called for a ban , including @entity170 , the @entity171 speaker			2
but mr @entity47 reiterated he would not impose a ban , unless advice from experts changed			2
there are no direct flights from @entity24 , @entity16 and @entity15 to the @entity46 and only a handful of international flights to @entity179			1
people flying out of these countries are screened before they board a plane			0
earlier this week , @entity183 announced it was closing its borders to international tourists because of concerns about @entity40			0
a travel ban was never adopted in the 2003 @entity189 outbreak , although it affected about 8,000 people .			2
