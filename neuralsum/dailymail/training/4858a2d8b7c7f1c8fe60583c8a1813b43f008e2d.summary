by @entity0 published : 00:21 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 00:24 est , 27 march 2012 after 76 days at sea a @entity2 canoeist has become the first person to paddle across the @entity5			1
@entity6 , of @entity7 , set off from @entity8 , @entity9 on december 21 to begin his solo mission from @entity11 to the @entity12			1
on sunday he reached the island of @entity14 , having made one brief stop in the @entity16 for rest and supplies			1
a long way from home : @entity6 set off in december from @entity9 and arrived in @entity14 on sunday @entity6 was incommunicado for 50 days of his voyage after his 7.5 metre canoe capsized , damaging his communications equipment			1
it had been his only way of keeping in contact with his family , having turned down a satellite tracking system because it was too expensive			1
so since the line went dead on february his wife @entity28 could only wait and hope for the best			1
she had previously rowed the @entity5 with @entity6 but on this occasion remained behind in @entity7			1
‘ the supplier raised the price at the last minute and i decided to leave without one because it was not possible to postpone the trip , ’ the 30 - year - old said from @entity32 in southern @entity14			1
‘ this trip was the first time i did n’t have a tracking system and the first time i really would have needed one			2
’ treacherous : @entity6 made his voyage without a satellite tracking system because of the expense but @entity28 remained convinced sure her husband was alive and well throughout his seven weeks of silence , maintaining her certitude that it would be down to equipment failure and nothing more sombre			1
she posted entries daily on their website , speculating about his position in the canoe nicknamed @entity53 and what weather conditions he might be facing			2
@entity6 said that in his solitude he often thought about what his loved ones would be going through in his absence			2
he added that he felt heartened by the faith and confidence his family had in his abilities during the long and unavoidable silence			2
‘ i was positively surprised in those at home ... because everyone was certain that if i run into any difficulties , i ’ll be able to solve them , ’ @entity6 said			2
‘ it was a great relief to reach port because it meant completing the journey and because my family could finally know for sure that i was ok			0
’ in his small vessel @entity6 was at the mercy of the elements and off the radar for many larger boats			0
lonely : @entity6 was incommunicado for 50 of his 76 days at sea after his canoe capsized rendering his communications equipment useless he lit smoke flares on three separate occasions to signal ships passing nearby , but failed to communicate with them			1
‘ some slowed and even changed direction as they likely picked me up on their radars , ’ @entity6 said			0
‘ but i was often surrounded by waves 4 meters high and the canoe is less than one meter high , so it ’s most likely that they simply were n’t able to see me			0
’ despite @entity6 ’s technical difficulties he reached his destination 20 days earlier than planned			0
since docking , his achievement has been confirmed by the @entity97 - based @entity96 , which adjudicates such feats for the @entity99			0
@entity5 crossings had previously been made in rowboats and kayaks , but not a canoe , in which a paddle with a single blade is used			0
‘ we were disappointed he had no satellite tracking on board , ’ said @entity107 , editor - in - chief of the society ’s website			0
‘ we are very pleased to hear that he has arrived			0
’ ‘ i was very interested in discovering what it ’s like to be all alone on a ship in the ocean , ’ @entity6 said			0
‘ it was my childhood dream			0
