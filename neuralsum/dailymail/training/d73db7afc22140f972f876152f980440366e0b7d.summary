@entity0 had only just made the double substitution which would see home the three points on his managerial debut in the @entity5			1
within 60 seconds , however , his side had surrendered their lead and the new manager 's winning start was gone			2
@entity10 's double had fired @entity0 to within five minutes of victory after @entity13 's stunning opener for the visitors			1
' i 'm disappointed really , ' said @entity0 , a surprise appointment at the @entity24 during the summer			1
' i felt there were a lot of good things			0
it was a great response to going behind			0
we controlled the first half and we had a lot of momentum , we did n't want half - time to come			2
' but having got ourselves in front i hoped – and expected – us to stay in front			2
' @entity78 's double change saw former @entity15 midfielder @entity56 and @entity95 replaced by @entity59 and @entity54			1
and @entity0 explained : ' @entity56 had cramp and that comes because of nervous energy playing against @entity15 in his first game and so forth			1
' @entity53 had done an awful lot of work and looked as if he was beginning to struggle			0
' so those were the reasons ( for the changes )			0
' @entity13 's strike arrived after just four minutes			2
@entity18 could only half clear from a set - piece and the ball bounced invitingly to his feet 30 yards out			1
with one touch to set himself , the anchorman took aim for the top corner and duly located it in stunning fashion			0
it was his second goal in six years having only broken that duck at @entity116 in april			0
the hosts were awarded what @entity0 admitted was a ' soft ' penalty before the break when @entity60 toppled under minimal contact from @entity73 and @entity10 converted			1
@entity15 's @entity40 – a £ 10m signing from @entity122 last week – was making his bow in an advanced midfield role but failed to impact and it was no surprise when he was withdrawn midway through the second period			1
drawing the @entity18 level : @entity10 calmly stroked a penalty past @entity128 to make it 1 - 1 shortly before the break at the @entity24 job done : the @entity132 player is congratulated by his team - mates after equalising from the penalty spot for the hosts in front of their own fans feel the noise : @entity10 salutes the @entity18 fans at the @entity24 after firing his penalty into the bottom left corner of @entity128 's goal @entity145 miles @entity18 total 105.8 65.7 @entity55 90 10.8 6.7 @entity10 90 10.8 6.7 @entity52 90 10.6 6.6 @entity15 total 107.1 66.5 @entity21 90 11.5 7.2 @entity13 90 10.7 6.7 @entity146 90 10.0 6.2 @entity40 's role was occupied by @entity56 at the @entity148 last season and it was he who laid on @entity18 's second			1
@entity128 should have done better when stooping to save @entity53 ' low strike from distance and his spill allowed @entity56 to dig out a cross to the far post where @entity10 was steaming in to volley home			2
@entity10 was the chief threat throughout for the @entity18 and @entity78 expects the 21 - year - old to remain at the club beyond this month			1
' i ca n't see anyway that this club would be interested in letting @entity10 go , ' said @entity0			2
' you ca n't let top , @entity164 , talented players go			0
this could be a very big season for him and beyond			0
' @entity81 , meanwhile , was encouraged by the manner of his side 's comeback which was secured when @entity171 was sprung clear by @entity172 and he squared for @entity21 to side - foot beyond @entity22			1
' we had a great start and it was a great goal , ' said the @entity176			0
' then we had 25 minutes which were a technical disaster			0
we could n't pass the ball			0
' we were much better in the second half and more aggressive			2
' maybe last year , after conceding the second goal , we would have collapsed and conceded three or four but we have a better and stronger mentality in the team			0
' that 's a good sign for the future			0
' @entity13 fired @entity15 in front with a fierce range from distance ... for more to go to our brilliant @entity188 furious : @entity15 boss @entity81 remonstrates with @entity76 after the referee awarded @entity18 a penalty in the 42nd minute of the game competitive debut : @entity40 , left , a recent £ 10m signing from @entity122 , played 68 minutes for @entity15 before being replaced by @entity172 powerful performance : @entity13 broke the deadlock early on with a strike from distance and put in a combative display in the middle of the park for the visitors penalty decision : @entity18 forward @entity60 is dragged down by @entity15 's @entity73 for the penalty decision in the 42nd minute of the match happy chap : @entity10 thought he had sealed three points for @entity18 when he put them ahead with a cute finish in the 74th minute of the game vital clearance : @entity15 striker @entity210 helps his side out defensively , clearing @entity50 's effort off the line at the @entity24 late rally : @entity81 will be pleased with the manner in which his @entity15 team fought back to secure a point through @entity21 's late equaliser @entity219 : a @entity18 fan shows his emotions during their opening - day draw against @entity15 at the @entity24 at saturday afternoon @entity223 disappointed to surrender lead			1

@entity15 midfielder @entity13 opened the scoring with a long - range finish in the fifth minute at the @entity24
@entity18 forward @entity10 drew the hosts level from the penalty spot just before the interval
the *attacker* put @entity0 's side in front midway through the second half of their opening @entity5 game
but @entity15 were level in the 85th minute when @entity21 scored at the near post to make it 2 - 2
@entity18 boss @entity0 rues late @entity15 equaliser on @entity5 managerial debut
