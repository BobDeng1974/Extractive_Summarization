the survey did not cover the period since the @entity51 was released , which explains its absence from the top ten			0
other @entity15 reports already look at brand satisfaction and handset satisfaction individually			0
@entity15 's index was based on phone and email interviews with 2,500 participants			0
the survey scored phones , and ultimately brands , based on anticipation of quality compared to the product 's actual quality , reliability , and value for money			1

these answers were used to create the overall score using a complex methodology			0
the study claims that the presence of @entity1 's product at the top of list demonstrates an upward trend			1
' if the [ @entity95 ] @entity51 performs as well , or even better , in the eyes of customers , @entity1 could threaten @entity6 ’s dominance in overall customer satisfaction , ' said acsi director @entity98			1
@entity99 continued that the @entity1 phones scored highly for their larger screens , compared to @entity6 , and their price			1

yet it ’s also striking that the @entity19 , announced in june 2010 and the @entity18 , announced in october 2011 are rated as highly as the 9 - month - old @entity17 and nearly as highly as the much more recent @entity1 phones			2
' @entity1 launched the @entity4 in may 2012 and the @entity13 five months later			1
@entity1 's success may also be due to the popularity of its android operating system			1
a recent study form @entity134 showed @entity135 with a 51.5 per cent market share , while @entity137 had 42.5 per cent			0
however , these figures may be slightly misleading because more phones run @entity135 than @entity137 across the board			0

@entity6 ’s faults were related to touch or button errors			0
according to recent figures from @entity163 , the @entity19 is still the @entity164 ’s favourite mobile phone			0
@entity1 ’s @entity51 has so far failed to emulate the @entity4 ’s resounding success although the @entity95 range still dominates with five handsets in the top ten , compared to @entity6 ’s three			1
