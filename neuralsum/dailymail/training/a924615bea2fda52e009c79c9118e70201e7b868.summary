published : 11:57 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 11:58 est , 19 june 2012 confused council officials stormed a village pub thinking they were busting an illegal late - night gig - only to realise @entity3 was the name of the band , not the starting time			1
three licensing officers and two police officers raided the feathers , in the sleepy @entity11 village of @entity12 , after spotting an advert promising ‘ music from 4am ’			1
the name of the band - billed as a two - piece soul funk combo - led bungling council inspectors to assume the pub gig would kick off at 4am , and they lay in wait to raid the pub before striking just after 10pm			1
' very confused ' : @entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 were baffled after council officials mistook their band name , 4am , for a late - night stage time @entity26 , landlady of the feathers , said she was ‘ amazed ’ at the ‘ sting ’ operation - saying it was unbelievable that two police officers were called in to back up the three licensing staff from @entity31			1
she said it was like ‘ using a sledgehammer to crack a nut ’ , adding : ' they turned up with two police officers and three council officers			1
' i was outside at the time collecting glasses ( and ) i came into the pub and said : " what on earth is this all about ? "			2
' they wanted to know if there was going to be music on until 4am and i was absolutely speechless for the first time in my life			2
' i ’m too old to stay up that late			0
' the duo , named 4am after a song by jazz legend @entity52 , is made up of singer @entity21 and drummer @entity22			0
mr @entity21 said everyone was ‘ very confused ’ about the raid , adding : ' this has never happened to us before			2
raided : customers and staff at @entity60 , in the sleepy @entity11 village of @entity12 , were stunned to see police and council inspectors charge in ' we ’re called 4am after one of our favourite tracks by @entity52			1
that ’s how we got the name , it ’s from the album mr @entity70			0
' when we were looking for a name that was our favourite album			0
we play stuff to get the ladies dancing , it ’s all dance and soul			0
' @entity75 , 32 , was at the gig when the raid took place - and said it was ‘ totally ridiculous ’			1
he said : ' these two police officers came in with these three guys from the council and they were very confrontational			1
' you should have seen their faces when they realised the name of the band was 4am , not the time of the gig - they shot off with their tails between their legs			2
' it will take quite a while for them to live this one down			0
' a spokesman for @entity31 admitted yesterday that its officers had made an error after spotting a poster for the gig earlier this month			2
he said : ' following a visit to the feathers , there was no cause for concern			0
the visit was carried out after seeing an advertisement which mentioned 4am			0
' on investigation , this was part of the name of the band			0

bungling licensing officers had police back - up for raid in @entity11 village
