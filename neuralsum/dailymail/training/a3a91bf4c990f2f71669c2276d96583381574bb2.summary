two drunk women who caused havoc on a flight to @entity3 that forced the captain to make an emergency landing have been jailed			1
@entity6 and @entity7 caused misery to other passengers			2
their antics were so bad the captain diverted the plane to @entity13 and had them removed from the plane			0
that cost @entity17 more than £ 4,500 and delayed the flight by four hours , @entity19 , 2012			1
@entity6 and @entity7 have been jailed after their appalling behaviour on a 2012 @entity17 flight to @entity3 ( file photo ) the out - of - control pair swigged from a bottle of @entity26 , hid inside toilets , swore in front of children and were aggressive towards air crew - @entity30 even lit up a cigarette at 30,000 feet			1
both women were jailed for eight months at @entity33 last month after @entity30 admitted acting in a destructive manner on an aircraft and @entity7 endangering the safety of an aircraft			1
the details of their case have now emerged for the first time as judges at @entity45 's @entity44 cut @entity30 's sentence to six months			1
the court heard the friends were travelling on board a @entity17 flight from @entity51 to @entity52 for some winter sun on december 31 , 2012 , when they caused havoc			2
@entity30 and @entity7 had both been drinking before boarding the plane			2
judge @entity56 said there was an ' unpleasant scene ' as the pair were asked to move from the seats they had chosen			0
that was because @entity30 was in a wheelchair at the time and needed to be in the part of the plane reserved for disabled passengers			0
he said the pair were ' much the worse for drink ' and began behaving badly , being abusive to staff and upsetting other holidaymakers			0
the pair were jailed at @entity71 the judge added : ' passengers who were on their way to enjoy a winter holiday were affronted and disturbed by their behaviour			0
' when they were refused alcohol by staff , they opened a bottle of @entity26 they had bought in duty free and swigged from that until it was confiscated			0
their behaviour was so appalling that one air hostess served them with a written warning - which they ripped up in front of her			0
they then followed her into the galley , where she was confronted and pushed , before hiding in a toilet cubicle - where @entity30 started smoking			1
after seeing the drama unfold on @entity99 from the cockpit , and hearing their raised voices , the captain took the decision they would have to be ejected from the plane and made an emergency detour to @entity13			2
@entity30 and @entity7 were handed over to @entity108 police before being flown back to the @entity109			1
the diversion cost @entity17 £ 4,683 and passengers were held up as the plane was delayed for hours			1
judge @entity56 said it was ' hardly surprising ' the crown court judge sent both women to jail			0
he added : ' their conduct was prolonged and caused distress to other passengers - not only by the delay and inconvenience , but also by the incidents themselves			0
' however , allowing @entity30 's appeal against the length of her jail term , he said her personal difficulties meant her sentence should be reduced			1
sitting with @entity132 and mr @entity133 , he added : ' we have come to this position entirely because of the nature and degree of the personal mitigation available to her			0
