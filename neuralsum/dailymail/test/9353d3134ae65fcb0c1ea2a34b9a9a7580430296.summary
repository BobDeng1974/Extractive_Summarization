societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in an all - powerful deity , according to new research			1
the study uncovered a link between belief in @entity9 and other societal characteristics , such as a strong social hierarchy			1
scientists suggest that religious beliefs help people cope in inhospitable habitats			2

here , people carry bags of popcorn through a @entity24 cemetery , to sell in a shanty town in @entity26 , @entity27 ‘ when life is tough or when it 's uncertain , people believe in big gods , ’ said @entity28 , a professor at the @entity29 and a founding director of the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			1
‘ @entity38 [ actions that help others ] maybe helps people do well in harsh or unpredictable environments			0
’ together with other experts , he found that communities that believe in a high , controlling @entity9 or gods who enforce a moral code , tend to live in politically complex groups with a social hierarchy beyond the local community - and often tend to animals			1
while the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors , the study by the @entity53 ( @entity54 ) in @entity55 , @entity56 , implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological , historical , and cultural factors			1

here , devotees prepare ritual rice dishes to offer to the @entity70 sun god as they attend @entity72 celebrations , at a slum in @entity74 the @entity75 is one of the least religious places in the world , according to a new survey			0
in a global ranking of 65 countries , the @entity75 came sixth from last , with only 30 per cent of the population calling themselves religious			0
this compared to 53 per cent who said they were not religious and 13 per cent who are ‘ convinced atheists ’ , with the remaining @entity75 saying they ‘ did not know ’			0
in contrast , 94 per cent of people in @entity89 deem themselves religious , with @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 completing the top five , with 93 per cent each			0
at the bottom of the list was @entity97 , where 61 per cent of people are atheists , with only six per cent regarding themselves as religious			0
it was followed by @entity100 where just 13 per cent are religious , @entity101 with 19 per cent and the @entity102 on 23 per cent			0
globally two - thirds of people consider themselves religious			1
those under the age of 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups , the survey by market researcher @entity106 found			0
people without a formal education were also more likely to practice a faith			0
‘ when researchers discuss the forces that shaped human history , there is considerable disagreement as to whether our behaviour is primarily determined by culture or by the environment , " said primary author @entity112 , of @entity113			0
‘ we wanted to throw away all preconceived notions regarding these processes and look at all the potential drivers together to see how different aspects of the human experience may have contributed to the behavioural patterns we see today			0
’ the study , published in @entity130 , took into account variables associated with the environment , history , and culture and involved experts in biology , ecology , linguistics , anthropology , and theology			1
it began when evolutionary ecologist dr @entity112 plotted ethnographic data of societies that believe in moralising , high gods and found that their global distribution is quite similar to a map of cooperative breeding in birds			1
he took the link to mean that ecological factors must play a part in the spread of religion , and another study has recently found a connection between a belief in moralising gods and group cooperation			1
professor @entity28 said : ‘ although some aspects of religion appear maladaptive , the near universal prevalence of religion suggests that there 's got to be some adaptive value and by looking at how these things vary ecologically , we get some insight			1
’ while the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors , the study implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological , historical , and cultural factors			1
here , @entity174 on the outskirts of @entity176 participate in friday prayers at a slum area during the holy month of @entity179 the team used historical , social , and ecological data , such as plant growth , rain and temperature , for 583 societies to illustrate the multifaceted relationship between belief in moralising , high gods and external variables			1
they used the @entity192 , which was collated during the last century , to pinpoint communities around the world and access data about religious beliefs , agriculture , and animal husbandry			2
‘ the goal became not just to look at the ecological variables , but to look at the whole thing			0
' once we accounted for as many other factors as we could , we wanted to see if we could still detect an environmental effect , ’ dr @entity112 said			0
‘ the overall picture is that these beliefs are ultimately shaped by a combination of historical , ecological , and social factors			2
’ dr @entity112 believes that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in examining human behaviour from a cross-disciplinary standpoint			2
the team plans to further their study by exploring the processes that have influenced the evolution of other human behaviours including taboos , circumcision , and the modification of natural habitats			2
being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous - a phenomenon known as @entity228 , after the @entity226 character ( shown ) being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous , according to a new study			1
it also boosts the feeling of pleasure we get from doing a good deed			0
‘ acting pro-socially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety , and in turn produces psychological satisfaction , ’ researchers from the @entity235 wrote in a study published in the @entity237			2
the study builds on the terror management theory , which says that humans deal with our fear of death by believing in an afterlife or devoting our lives to a cause that will live on , @entity243 reported			2
previous work found that @entity254 reminded of their own mortaility gave more money to a charity that said it would help people in the country , than one that had an international focus			0
it suggested that thoughts of death made people strengthen their beliefs - such as allegiance to a religion or country – and is known as @entity228			2
the new study included an experiment , where people were asked to split $ 8 between themselves and a stranger , while reporting their own satisfaction			2
before this , @entity276 student participants were asked to fill out a survey about death , or dealing with a trip to the dentists , then complete a crossword			0
the researchers found that volunteers who had previously thought about death gave more money to the stranger and said they felt happier doing it			0
the experiment seems to bolster @entity228 and suggests that reinforcing a person ’s self - image of being generous , or supporting a cause , are effective ways of managing fear of dying .			1

study was conducted by @entity53 , @entity55
it suggests that societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in all - powerful , moralistic deities
research also uncovered link between a belief in high gods who enforce a moral code and a strong social hierarchy
