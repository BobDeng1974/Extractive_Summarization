drug smugglers are turning ' trusted travelers ' into unwitting mules by placing containers with powerful magnets under their cars in @entity6 and then recovering the illegal cargo far from the view of border authorities in the @entity10			1
one motorist spotted the containers while pumping gas after crossing into @entity13 on jan. 12 and thought it might be a bomb			2
his call to police prompted an emergency response at the @entity19 station , and then a shocker : 13.2 pounds of heroin were pulled from under the vehicle , according to a @entity10 law enforcement official			1
@entity25 police said the drugs were packed inside six magnetized cylinders			2
border patrol : @entity30 users are being targeted by drug smugglers who place magnetized boxes under the cars of unsuspecting drivers ( 2005 file photo ) the driver had just used a ' trusted traveler ' lane at the @entity40 border crossing , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because some details of the case have not been made public			1
authorities have learned of at least three similar incidents in @entity25 since then , all involving drivers enrolled in the enormously popular @entity30 program , which stands for @entity30			1
there were 12.6 million @entity30 vehicle crossings in fiscal 2013 , more than double the 5.9 million four years earlier			1
the program enables hundreds of thousands of people who pass extensive background checks to whiz past inspectors with less scrutiny			1
signing up can reduce rush - hour wait times from more than two hours to less than 15 minutes at @entity25 's @entity40 port of entry , the nation 's busiest crossing , where @entity30 users represented 40 percent of the 4.5 million vehicle crossings in fiscal 2013 , the @entity58 found			1
but like other prescreening programs , there 's a potential downside : the traveler can become a target , and such cases can be tricky for investigators when people caught with drugs claim they were planted			0
using magnets under cars is n't new , but this string of cases is unusual			2
the main targets are people who park for hours in @entity6 before returning to the @entity10 , authorities say			1
smugglers track their movements on both sides of the border , figuring out their travel patterns and where they park			1
it takes only seconds to attach and remove the magnetized containers when no one is looking			1
' it 's a concern for everyone , not as big a concern for me because i 'm careful , ' said @entity94 , a @entity30 user and office assistant at the @entity96 who parks in a garage when home in @entity102 and varies his routes			2
' people should be worried because they go straight home and straight to work			0
' ' trusted travelers ' were issued windshield decals for years , but they are no longer needed to identify vehicles approaching the inspection booths			1
new stickers have n't been issued since 2013 , and the @entity111 agency says existing stickers can be removed			0
many have n't heeded the call , which can make them a target			0
the @entity116 in @entity25 told newsletter readers last week that decals should go			0
' it 's basically demonstrating that you are a @entity30 user , ' said @entity121 , the chamber 's executive director			2
' criminals are savvy , and they know they are part of a program where they are not checked as much			0
' @entity111 says frequent crossers also should vary their travel routines and keep a closer eye on their cars			2
there have been 29 cases of motorists unwittingly carrying drugs under their cars in the @entity25 area since @entity136 identified the trend in july 2011 , including six drivers who made it past inspectors , said spokeswoman @entity141			0
any driver who suspects something 's amiss under their car should immediately report it , to better show their innocence , authorities say			0
officer @entity149 , a @entity25 police spokesman , said " it would be inappropriate " to make public more details about the jan. 12 seizure , and @entity111 spokeswoman @entity150 also declined to comment , calling it a local police investigation			0
there have been three seizures since , all involving @entity30 drivers who were not charged : — on jan. 13 , inspectors at the @entity161 border crossing found 35 pounds of marijuana in seven packages attached by powerful magnets to the bottom of a 2010 @entity166			1
— on tuesday , a driver alerted an inspector at @entity161 to a package under a 2010 @entity170 , and 8 pounds of methamphetamine were found in three packages underneath			0
— on wednesday , a dog at @entity40 alerted inspectors to a 2000 @entity175 with 18 pounds of marijuana underneath			0
that driver was enrolled in @entity30 but using a regular lane			2
@entity179 , @entity111 's @entity25 field office director , acknowledged that it 's unusual to have so many cases in fewer than two weeks			0
' it 's a cat - and - mouse game , ' @entity179 said			0
' each change they make prompts a change from law enforcement , which in turn prompts them to again change their tactics			0
