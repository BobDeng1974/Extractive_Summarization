by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 11:45 est , 24 september 2013 the moon just got younger - by a few hundred million years			2
scientists now claim that the moon is around 4.4 and 4.45 billion years old , rather than the 4.56 billion years previously thought			1
despite being the nearest body to the @entity5 , astronomers are still not sure precisely how or when it formed			0
this collision divided @entity5 into two unequal parts			0
the smaller of these condensed into the @entity15 one theory suggests the moon formed when a planet , around the size of @entity11 , collided with @entity5 around 4.56 billion years ago			1
this collision divided @entity5 into two unequal parts			0
the smaller of these condensed into the moon			0
the best simulations of this process suggest that about 80 per cent of moon ought to have come from the impactor and 20 per cent from the @entity5			2
scientists have long studied the moon ’s crustal rocks to try and estimate its age			1
video : the evolution of the moon as methods have improved , the most precisely determined age for the lunar rocks that arose is 4.360 billion years , the researchers said			1
meanwhile on @entity5 , scientists have found signs of a major melting event that occurred around 4.45 billion years ago			1
from this , researchers have drawn the conclusion that the catastrophic collision that formed the moon occurred around 100 million years or so before			0
‘ there are several important implications of this late moon formation that have not yet been worked out , ’ said @entity42 , of the @entity43 in @entity44			0
‘ for example , if the @entity5 was already differentiated prior to the giant impact , would the impact have blown off the primordial atmosphere that formed from this earlier epoch of @entity5 history ? ’ the results were presented yesterday at a meeting organised by the @entity56 in @entity57 called ‘ @entity58 of the moon			0
’ researchers have drawn the conclusion that the catastrophic collision that formed the moon occurred around 100 million years or so before a controversial new theory has been proposed that a giant explosion equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs originating from the @entity5 's core somehow led to the formation of the moon			1
planetary scientist @entity67 believes this violent event took place approximately four - and - a - half billion years ago and could answer the hotly contested question of where our moon comes from			1
the scientist , from @entity74 in @entity75 , told @entity77 magazine that previous explanations about how the moon came to be simply do not add @entity80 analysis of the rocks last year by the @entity82 found that they shared identical oxygen , silicon and potassium isotopes with @entity5 , hinting that the @entity15 shares its origin with the @entity5			2
@entity87 said that taken at face value , the findings suggest that the moon was once part of the @entity5 that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion from the @entity5 's fiery core			2
to do this , he believes that there must have been a ' massive energy kick ' delivered quickly and he calculates that the explosion was the strength of 40 billion atomic bombs the size of those dropped on @entity101 .			0

scientists claim that the moon formed around 4.4 and 4.45 billion years ago - rather than the 4.56 billion years previously thought
they suggest a planet collided with @entity5 at this time *creating* the moon
the findings are the result of analysis from lunar crustal rocks and signs of a major melting event on @entity5
