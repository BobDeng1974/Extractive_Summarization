an unnamed woman was brought into the @entity8 by criminals operating a black market trade in body parts for transplant			0
new details were released today by the @entity1 , which was awarded a contract by the @entity20 to provide victims with safe accommodation , counselling , medical care , translation services and legal counselling			1
during the first six months of the contract , more than two fifths ( 41 per cent ) of the people they worked with in @entity29 and @entity30 were male			1
the charity helped 112 women and 78 men between july 1 and december 31 last year , supporting them through their experiences and helping them rebuild their lives			0
almost half ( 45 per cent ) had been forced into sexual exploitation , while 43 per cent were trafficked into forced labour and eight per cent into domestic servitude			0
the police referred 44 per cent of the victims , with the south east of @entity29 accounting for more than half ( 54 per cent ) of referrals			0
the majority of the 190 had come from eastern @entity46 ( 58 per cent ) , a quarter had been brought in from @entity47 and 12 per cent from @entity48 , while another four per cent had been trafficked from within @entity8 borders			0
a survey conducted by @entity51 also revealed the public 's misconceptions about the face of human trafficking			0
respondents thought 68 per cent of victims were sexually exploited - a much higher proportion than that seen by the @entity1 - and that just 29 per cent of victims in @entity29 and @entity30 were male			1
among the male victims helped by the @entity1 were two men from the @entity63 , who had been trafficked to the @entity8 for forced labour after they answered a job advert in a national newspaper			1
the pair , who had thought they were being taken on as factory supervisors in @entity29 , told how they were sold numerous times between gangmasters within the @entity8			0
@entity73 : the minister for justice said ' male victims are often overlooked ' the @entity1 gave the victims temporary accommodation and support until they were able to @entity79 amd start a new life			1
one of them , named only as @entity82 , said : ' i was given the number of @entity1			2
' they saved me and they took me to a police station , where i made a statement			0
' that same day , we helped my friend to escape who had been trafficked the same way as me			2
' @entity1 hid us in a safe house			2
' it 's sad but it 's true : there are hundreds of people with similar stories to me , people who have been fraudulently bought and sold			0
' major @entity100 , the @entity1 's anti-trafficking response co-ordinator , said : ' male or female , no matter where the victim is in @entity29 and @entity30 or the reason that they are trafficked , we are helping all people caught up in all types of trafficking to get them the support they need , when they need it			1
' @entity1 has a strong track record of supporting victims of human trafficking and we are working with a wide range of experts in delivering the contract to ensure that specialist , individually tailored support is available to every victim			2
' this includes gender - specific services and support for victims with disabilities and mental health needs			0
' minister for justice , @entity73 , said : ' human trafficking is often seen as predominantly affecting women - meaning that male victims are often overlooked and are forced to go without the support they so desperately need			1
' the support @entity1 offer to trafficking victims , regardless of gender , was a key reason why they were awarded the contract			2
' in the first six months of providing this service , @entity1 have shown that they are able to offer a high quality , tailored system of support to some of the most vulnerable victims , regardless of their country of origin , religion or gender			1

@entity1 reports back on nearly 200 trafficked people it helped over six months
*surprisingly* high proportion of male victims revealed
