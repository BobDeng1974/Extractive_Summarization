when @entity1 romped to a 4 - 0 win against @entity4 minnows @entity3 on tuesday , they became the first side to have won each of their @entity8 group stage matches twice			1
@entity1 first achieved the impressive feat back in the 2011 - 12 season when they beat @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 across six fixtures			1
@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 have also managed to emerge victorious in every one of their group games in the past , although none of these sides have gone on to lift the trophy			1
@entity25 scores from the penalty spot during @entity1 's 4 - 0 win against @entity3 @entity28 ( second from left ) goes to congratulate @entity25 as @entity1 sealed their 19th consecutive win @entity25 and @entity1 are looking to become the first side to lift the trophy after winning all of their group games @entity15 ( 1992 - 93 ) lost 1 - 0 to @entity34 in the final @entity18 ( 1994 - 95 ) knocked out by @entity15 in the semi-finals @entity37 ( 1995 - 96 ) lost to @entity38 at the quarter - final stage @entity16 ( 2002 - 03 ) dumped out by @entity40 in the last eight @entity1 ( 2011 - 12 ) beaten by @entity41 on penalties in the semi-finals having won 19 successive games in all competitions , @entity1 are one of the favourites to triumph in this season 's @entity8 , along with @entity50 giants @entity41			1
but the @entity52 leaders will need to break a curse which stretches back to the 1992 - 93 season , when @entity15 lost 1 - 0 to @entity34 in the final after cruising through a group which also included @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			2
the same thing happened to @entity18 two years later when , after gaining maximum points from group fixtures against @entity41 , @entity37 and @entity65 , the @entity62 outfit lost to @entity15 at the semi-final stage			0
the following season @entity37 eased through a group containing @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 before crashing out to @entity38 in the last eight			0
@entity34 's players celebrate with the @entity8 trophy in 1993 after beating @entity15 1 - 0 in @entity75 @entity15 stars applaud the home fans at the @entity78 after beating @entity18 in the 1995 - 96 semi-finals @entity16 appeared to be on course to lift the trophy in 2003 after outclassing @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , only for @entity40 to dump them out in the quarter - finals			2
and @entity86 's @entity1 side became the fifth team to succumb to the curse when , after reaching the semi-finals , they lost to @entity41 on penalties at the @entity92 in april 2012			2
the current @entity1 side face a two - legged last 16 clash with either @entity40 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity18 , @entity98 or @entity99 in february and march next year			0
@entity100 will tell if one of those teams are able to defeat @entity103 's in - form side and claim another victim for the curse of group domination			0
@entity40 stars including @entity109 ( left ) and @entity110 ( second from right ) celebrate beating @entity16 @entity41 's players run to celebrate their penalty shootout win against @entity1 in april 2012			0

@entity1 won all six of their @entity8 group games
@entity1 achieved the same feat under @entity86 in 2011 - 12
but no team has ever won all their group games and lifted the trophy
@entity15 , @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity16 are all victims of the curse
