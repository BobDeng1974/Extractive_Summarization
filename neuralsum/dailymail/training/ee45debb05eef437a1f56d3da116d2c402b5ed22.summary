more than half of @entity1 say the @entity1 government should do a great deal or quite a bit about the problem by @entity7 reporter published : 21:02 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 06:40 est , 15 december 2012 a growing majority of @entity1 think global warming is occurring , that it will become a serious problem and that the @entity1 government should do something about it , a new @entity7 - @entity9 poll finds			1
even most people who say they do n't trust scientists on the environment say temperatures are rising			1
the poll found 4 out of every 5 @entity1 said climate change will be a serious problem for the @entity1 if nothing is done about it			1
that 's up from 73 per cent when the same question was asked in 2009			1
rising concern : a growing majority of @entity1 think global warming is occurring , that it will become a serious problem and that the @entity1 government should do something about it , a new poll finds changing views : even most people who say they do n't trust scientists on the environment say temperatures are rising			1
and 57 per cent of @entity1 say the @entity1 government should do a great deal or quite a bit about the problem			1
that 's up from 52 per cent in 2009			1
only 22 per cent of those surveyed think little or nothing should be done , a figure that dropped from 25 per cent			0
overall , 78 per cent of those surveyed said they believe temperatures are rising , up from 75 per cent three years earlier			2
in general , @entity1 belief in global warming , according to @entity7 - @entity9 and other polls , has fluctuated over the years but has stayed between about 70 and 85 per cent			2
the biggest change in the polling is among people who trust scientists only a little or not at all			1
about 1 in 3 of the people surveyed fell into that category			0
within that highly sceptical group , 61 per cent now say temperatures have been rising over the past 100 years			2
a visible indicator : scientists believe that @entity60 with its melting ice caps and disappearing glaciers , is an accurate thermometer of global warming scientists say : this chart shows some of the believed impacts of global warming that 's a substantial increase from 2009 , when the @entity7 - @entity9 poll found that only 47 per cent of those with little or no trust in scientists believed the world was getting warmer			1
this is an important development because , often in the past , opinion about climate change does n't move much in core groups — like those who deny it exists and those who firmly believe it 's an alarming problem , said @entity83 , a @entity84 social psychologist and pollster			1
@entity83 , who consulted with the @entity7 on the poll questions , said the changes the poll shows are n't in the hard - core ‘ anti-warming ’ deniers , but in the next group , who had serious doubts			2
‘ they do n't believe what the scientists say , they believe what the thermometers say , ’ @entity83 said			2
‘ events are helping these people see what scientists thought they had been seeing all along			2
’ @entity104 , a retired freelance photographer from @entity105 , @entity106 , said he was ‘ fairly cynical ’ about scientists and their theories			0
but he believes very much in climate change because of what he 's seen with his own eyes			1
passing by : a fishing boat passes by icebergs floating in the @entity114 on august 26 , 2007 near the town of @entity116 , @entity60 ‘ having lived for 67 years , we consistently see more and more changes based upon the fact that the weather is warmer , ’ he said			0
‘ the seasons are more severe			0
the climate is definitely getting warmer			0
’ ‘ storms seem to be more severe , ’ he added			0
nearly half , 49 per cent , of those surveyed called global warming not just serious but ‘ very serious , ’ up from 42 per cent in 2009			2
more than half , 57 per cent , of those surveyed thought the @entity1 government should do a great deal or quite a bit about global warming , up from 52 per cent three years earlier			1
but only 45 per cent of those surveyed think president @entity135 will take major action to fight climate change in his second term , slightly more than the 41 per cent who do n't think he will act			1
overall , the 78 per cent who think temperatures are rising is not the highest percentage of @entity1 who have believed in climate change , according to @entity7 polling			1
in 2006 , less than a year after @entity145 devastated @entity146 , 85 per cent thought temperatures were rising			2
floating ice : an icebergs floats in the @entity114 on august 27 , 2007 near the town of @entity116 , @entity60 the lowest point in the past 15 years for belief in warming was in december 2009 , after some snowy winters and in the middle of an uproar about climate scientists ' emails that later independent investigations found showed no manipulation of data			1
broken down by political party , 83 per cent of @entity162 and 70 per cent of @entity163 say the world is getting warmer			0
and 77 per cent of independents say temperatures are rising			2
among scientists who write about the issue in peer - reviewed literature , the belief in global warming is about 97 per cent , according to a 2010 scientific study			2
about 1 in 4 people surveyed think that efforts to curb global warming would hurt the @entity1 economy , a figure down slightly from 27 per cent in 2009 when the economy was in worse shape			1
just under half , 46 per cent , think such action would help the @entity1 economy , about the same as said so three years ago			1
the @entity7 - @entity9 poll was conducted november 29 to december 3 by @entity184 and @entity185			0
it involved landline and cell phone interviews with 1,002 adults nationwide			0
results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points ; the margin of error is larger for subgroups			0
the latest @entity7 - @entity9 poll jibes with other surveys and more in - depth research on global warming , said @entity203 , director of @entity205 's @entity204			2
he took no part in the poll.mets0ryankies when climate change belief was at its lowest , concerns about the economy were heightened and the country had gone through some incredible snowstorms and that may have chipped away at some belief in global warming , @entity203 said			1
now the economy is better and the weather is warmer and worse in ways that seem easier to connect to climate change , he said			1
‘ one extreme event after another after another , ’ @entity203 said			0
‘ people have noticed ... they 're connecting the dots between climate change and this long bout of extreme weather themselves			1
’ @entity229 , 77 , of @entity230 , said you ca n't help but notice it			0
‘ we use to have mild temperatures in the fall going into winter months			0
now , we have summer temperatures going into winter , ’ @entity229 said			0
‘ the whole @entity237 is getting warmer and when it gets warmer , the ice cap is going to melt and the ocean is going to rise			0
’ he also said that 's what he thinks is causing recent extreme weather			0
‘ that 's why you see @entity250 and @entity251 , ’ he said , referring to @entity245 and its devastation in late october			0
‘ when you have a flood like that , flooding tunnels like that			0
and look at how long the tunnel has been there			0
’ first - hand observer : a @entity60 @entity260 hunter and fisherman steers his boat past a melting iceberg , along a fjord leading away from the edge of the @entity60 ice sheet			0

a recent poll found 4 out of every 5 @entity1 said climate change will be a serious problem for the @entity1 if nothing is done about it
that 's up from 73 per cent when the same question was asked in 2009
even most people who say they do n't trust scientists on the environment say temperatures are rising
more than half of @entity1 say the @entity1 government should do a great deal or quite a bit about the problem
