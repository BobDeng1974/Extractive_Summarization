@entity0 was utterly exhausted and emotionally drained as he and @entity1 held each other up through a post-match flash interview			1
it was as if these two warriors might collapse on camera if either of them moved , so they clung on and spoke happily if wearily after supplying the goals which fuelled this fight - back at @entity10			1
@entity0 is into his 38th year and could be doing something a little more leisurely than leading the line through 90 minutes at the sharp end of the season			1
centre - forward is a demanding role in any team , let alone one of @entity19 ’s			0
@entity20 celebrates his stunning third goal by putting the ball under his shirt as he congratulated by @entity24 @entity20 ( right ) struck his effort with such power that he had both feet off the ground at one point @entity20 's goal flew in at an incredible speed of nearly 60 miles per hour - leaving @entity32 in the @entity10 goal no chance @entity1 turns and celebrates after making it 2 - 1 to @entity35 with a close - range finish that @entity32 could not stop @entity1 ( right ) flicks home from close range after a scramble in the @entity10 box following a @entity35 corner @entity0 ( centre ) was the star of the show for @entity35 - and he was leading his team - mates in celebrations at full time @entity10 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity32 6 ; @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 6 ( @entity48 24 , 7 ) , @entity49 6.5 ; @entity50 7 , @entity51 6 ( @entity52 18 min , 6 ) , @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 6 ; @entity56 6 , @entity57 7.5 ( @entity58 77 )			1

but he and @entity1 are not shaped that way and the pride burned through their yellow shirts as they led their team - mates to salute three thousand noisy @entity35 supporters in the corner of the @entity106			1
they had trailed to a goal from @entity50 after a slightly lethargic first - half display but came out inspired and soon levelled through @entity0 , before @entity1 put the @entity110 ahead , 12 minutes from time , and @entity20 curled the third into the top corner			1
the strike by @entity20 triggered an ironic chorus of ' @entity35 ' from the visiting fans and they sang long into the night , aware that their team can be crowned champions on sunday at @entity117 if they beat @entity118			1
@entity19 tried to play down the party vibe but they will come in expectation because this has the feel of a procession after breaking through an awkward sequence of games with only one fit centre - forward , who happened to be 37			2
@entity0 ( right ) levels for @entity35 after beating @entity130 ( centre ) to the ball @entity0 looks on as his effort from inside the box drifts in to the far corner past @entity10 goalkeeper @entity32 @entity0 ( right ) wheels away in celebration as his team - mates @entity77 ( left ) and @entity73 ( centre ) congratulate him @entity0 is mobbed by his jubilant @entity35 team - mates after make it 1 - 1 just minutes into the second half @entity67 @entity118 ( home ) - may 3 @entity144 ( home ) - may 10 @entity146 ( away ) - may 18 @entity147 ( home ) - may 24 @entity10 @entity149 ( home ) - may 2 @entity151 ( home ) - may 9 @entity147 ( away ) - may 16 @entity153 ( home ) - may 24 @entity0 ’s legs do n’t cover quite the same ground at quite the same rate as they once did			1
he rarely gets clear of the back - line , it has been a long time since he screamed one into the top corner and his touch can be heavy			0
until wednesday night it had been a long time since he found the net			0
you have to go all the way back to @entity149 away in december , when he came on in a bid to rescue @entity35 from their first defeat of the campaign , and almost managed it			2
@entity0 has an impossible - to - pin - down ability to influence the game and his desire glows as fiercely as ever			1
he energised @entity35 with the equaliser - just as he once did in @entity174 in the @entity176 final			2
he missed chances and he might have scored more , but he never stopped showing for the ball or leading by example to those team - mates who have yet to cross this finish - line in a title race , as injured striker @entity183 and @entity184 looked on from the stands			2
@entity19 wanted all of his squad to travel and prepare together at @entity188 as a show of solidarity as they closed in on the goal			0
this was where the head - tennis video was filmed which went viral on wednesday			0
six @entity35 players headed the ball back and forth across the dinner table until it reached @entity76 , on the end , who nodded it into a bin			2
judging by the celebrations which followed , @entity184 is not far from a return			0
@entity50 calmly side - foots @entity10 in to the lead after a slip from @entity24 , who tries to make an amends with a block @entity50 ( centre ) manages to find the back of the net despite the efforts of @entity68 ( left ) and @entity70 on the line @entity50 ( right ) celebrates opening the scoring after an assist from @entity57 ( left ) @entity10 's players mob @entity50 after his goal puts them up in a vital game in their battle against relegation @entity50 finished off a @entity10 move which originally started in their own half - click here for more stats from our brilliant match zone @entity35 's players looked dejected after falling behind to @entity50 's goal just before the end of the second half on wednesday , it was over to the legends who have made the journey before to respond to the challenge set down by @entity66 ’s vibrant team , who offered more evidence , even in defeat , that they are capable of surviving the drop			1
@entity1 scored his seventh of the season , forcing the ball in from close range after @entity32 had saved from @entity70 at a corner			1
and @entity68 came in for @entity79 and played superbly , making a crucial save to thwart @entity55 when the game was goalless			0
@entity79 hurt his hip during sunday ’s draw at @entity245 and was on the bench			0
@entity68 came in for only his fifth @entity248 game of the season , but buoyed by the knowledge he had not conceded in this competition for more than a year			2
@entity10 started at a healthy tempo , seeking to use the electric pace of @entity57 , only to see their rhythm disrupted to injuries which forced @entity51 and @entity47 off before the interval			2
@entity35 dominated from midway through the first half but that did not prevent @entity10 from taking the lead on the break when @entity52 released @entity57 down the left			1
@entity57 beat @entity1 to the ball and cut his cross low and deep			2
it might have been aimed at @entity56 , but it bypassed the @entity265 striker and @entity24 slipped as he tried to adjust his feet			2
@entity54 seemed to be accused by @entity268 's players of stamping of @entity77 ( on the floor left ) @entity0 ( left ) misses with a right - footed shot from inside the box in the first half as he is closed down by @entity10 captain @entity49 @entity46 ( right ) dives to stop a low effort by @entity35 right back @entity24 ( centre ) @entity47 went off after just 24 minutes - @entity10 's second injury of the game after @entity277 also went off earlier @entity75 again played in a protective face mark to protect his broken nose - sustained in a collision with @entity280 earlier this month @entity35 manager @entity19 ( right ) and @entity130 boss @entity66 have a talk in the tunnel before kick off the upshot was a simple finish for @entity50 , arriving late with the ball set nicely and @entity68 ’s goal hopelessly exposed			1
he had not scored for more than four years but he made no mistake , sliding it low into the net			0
the @entity289 erupted as home fans detected an improbably fifth win on the bounce and another year in this lofty company			0
but @entity0 soon punctured those hopes when he reacted swiftly to beat substitute @entity295 to a low cross from @entity69 and hooked it past @entity32			1
it was a different game from this point			0
@entity35 had re-emerged in a different mood			0
there was extra urgency about their game and they would go on to win by more than one goal for the first time since a 5 - 0 win against @entity309 in mid-january			0
@entity0 fired one chance over and another wide but @entity1 produced the second , just as it seemed @entity19 would have to settle for a point			1
it could have been many more but @entity20 made it three			0
and it was n’t boring at all .			0

@entity50 opens the scoring for @entity10 with neat finish in the area after a slip by @entity24
@entity0 equalises for @entity35 just three minutes into the second half after an assist from @entity69
@entity1 puts @entity35 ahead with a close - range finish with just 11 minutes left to play
@entity20 seals the win for @entity35 with a stunning *drilled* effort from just outside the box
@entity35 can win the @entity248 title with *victory* against @entity118 at @entity117 on sunday
