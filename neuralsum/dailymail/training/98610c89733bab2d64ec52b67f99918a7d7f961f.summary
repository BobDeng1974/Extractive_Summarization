cyber criminals can make ten times more money hacking someone 's medical information rather than their credit card details , new research has shown			1
the @entity6 has warned @entity8 health care providers of the new threat after a group of @entity12 hackers stole personal information from 4.5 million patients after targeting the computer network of @entity16 internet security experts believe the $ 3 trillion @entity8 healthcare industry is a ripe target for cyber criminals because many health care providers use older computers with inadequate tools to protect the confidential information			1
he said : ' as attackers discover new methods to make money , the healthcare industry is becoming a much riper target because of the ability to sell large batches of personal data for profit			2
' hospitals have low security , so it 's relatively easy for these hackers to get a large amount of personal data for medical fraud			1
' interviews with nearly a dozen healthcare executives , cybersecurity investigators and fraud experts provide a detailed account of the underground market for stolen patient data			2
the data for sale includes names , birth dates , policy numbers , diagnosis codes and billing information			0
fraudsters use this data to create fake ids to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold , or they combine a patient number with a false provider number and file made - up claims with insurers , according to experts who have investigated cyber attacks on healthcare organizations			1
medical identity theft is often not immediately identified by a patient or their provider , giving criminals years to milk such credentials			2
that makes medical data more valuable than credit cards , which tend to be quickly canceled by banks once fraud is detected			1
stolen health credentials can go for $ 10 each , about 10 or 20 times the value of a @entity8 credit card number , according to @entity99 , director of threat intelligence at @entity100 , a cyber crime protection company			1
he obtained the data by monitoring underground exchanges where hackers sell the information			2
the percentage of healthcare organizations that have reported a criminal cyber attack has risen to 40 per cent in 2013 from 20 per cent in 2009 , according to an annual survey by the @entity110 think tank on data protection policy			0
the hacker access medical records and use the details to make fraudulent claims against insurance policies founder @entity118 , who is privy to details of attacks on healthcare firms that have not been made public , said he has seen an increase this year in both the number of cyber attacks and number of records stolen in those breaches			1
fueling that increase is a shift to electronic medical records by a majority of @entity8 healthcare providers			1
@entity133 , chief information officer of @entity134 in @entity135 , said his hospital system fends off thousands of attempts to penetrate its network each week			2
so far it is not aware of a successful attack			0
he said : ' the only reason to buy that data is so they can fraudulently bill			0
' healthcare providers and insurers must publicly disclose data breaches affecting more than 500 people , but there are no laws requiring criminal prosecution			0
as a result , the total cost of cyber attacks on the healthcare system is difficult to pin down			0
insurance industry experts say they are one of many expenses ultimately passed onto @entity8 as part of rising health insurance premiums			1
consumers sometimes discover their credentials have been stolen only after fraudsters use their personal medical @entity163 to impersonate them and obtain health services			2
when the unpaid bills are sent on to debt collectors , they track down the fraud victims and seek payment			0
@entity118 cited a case last year in which one patient learned that his records at a major hospital chain were compromised after he started receiving bills related to a heart procedure he had not undergone			0
the man 's credentials were also used to buy a mobility scooter and several pieces of medical equipment , racking up tens of thousands of dollars in total fraud			1
the government 's efforts to combat @entity186 fraud have focused on traditional types of scams that involve provider billing and over billing			0
fraud involving the @entity186 program for seniors and the disabled totaled more than $ 6 billion in the last two years , according to a database maintained by @entity196			0
@entity197 , vice president at cyber security firm @entity198 said : ' healthcare providers and hospitals are just some of the easiest networks to break into			1
' when i 've looked at hospitals , and when i 've talked to other people inside of a breach , they are using very old legacy systems - @entity208 systems that are 10 plus years old that have not seen a patch			0
' @entity213 partner @entity212 said security has been an afterthought for many medical providers - whether it is building encryption into software used to create electronic patient records or in setting budgets			1
he said : ' are you going to put money into a brand new mri machine or laser surgery or are you going to put money into a new firewall ? '			0

hospitals and health care providers are ' easy targets ' according to experts
