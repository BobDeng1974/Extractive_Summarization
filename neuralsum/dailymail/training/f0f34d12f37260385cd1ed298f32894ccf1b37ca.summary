by @entity0 for @entity1 how old are @entity3 's rings ? that ’s a question that has puzzled scientists for quite some time			2
some believe that they came to be in the last few hundred million years due to the accumulation of material , possibly from a destroyed moon			0
but now evidence from the @entity12 spacecraft suggests they have a much more ancient origin , coming into existence about 4.4 billion years ago			1
how and when @entity3 's rings formed ( @entity12 image shown ) has continuously puzzled scientists			2
most say that if they had an ancient origin of about 4.4 billion years then they should be dirtier than they are now			1
however , new evidence says they can be that old - their just are n't many pollutants for them to accumulate as reported by @entity27 , scientists at the @entity26 found the rings are very poor at accumulating material			1
launch : 15 october 1997 from @entity31 , @entity32 dimensions : 22 feet ( 6.7 metres ) high ; 13.1 feet ( 4 meters ) wide total weight : 5,712 kilograms ( 12,593 pounds ) with fuel , @entity37 probe , adapter , etc orbiter weight ( unfueled ) : 2,125 kilograms ( 4,685 pounds ) power : 885 watts ( 633 watts at end of mission ) from radioisotope thermoelectric generators @entity44 traveled to reach @entity3 : 2.2 billion miles ( 3.5 billion kilometres ) key instruments : imaging radar , cosmic dust analyser , infrared mapping spectrometer it had been thought that , if the rings were up to 4.4 billion years old , then they should have turned black as they collected particles from elsewhere in the solar system			1
however the scientists found the rate of accumulation was about 40 times lower than expected			0
this explains why they are so clean , despite their age			0
‘ if the pollution problem is not as severe , then the rings could last a lot longer before they turn black , ’ dr @entity59 , a planetary scientist at @entity60 told nature			2
the research was presented by dr @entity66 , a space physicist at the @entity26			0
it was based on data collected by @entity70 ’s @entity12 spacecraft , which is currently in orbit around @entity3			0
with his colleagues , dr @entity72 found that , over seven years , the rings had accumulated just 140 particles from elsewhere in the solar system			1
this rate of just 20 particles per year was 40 times less than expected , and suggests it is a lot less dusty out by @entity3 than thought			0
other theories for the formation of the rings include the possibility that a moon was ripped apart in the past few hundred million years , creating vast amounts of debris around the gas giant planet			0
here shadows can be seen cast across the rings in this image from @entity12 @entity70 's @entity12 ( illustration shown ) launched on 15 october 1997 and arrived in orbit around @entity3 on 30 june 2004			0
during this time it has dramatically increased our knowledge of the planetary system , revealing vast bodies of liquid on the surface of @entity98 , giant storms on @entity3 and much more it also supports the theory that the rings are ancient - around 4.4 billion years			1
‘ the rings can be three to ten times older than we used to think , ’ said dr @entity103 , a planetary scientist at the @entity26			2
one of the main pieces of evidence for @entity3 ’s rings being so old comes from the abundance of water - ice in their composition			1
the amount of water - ice is too much to have been brought to the rings by other means such as comets , suggesting they must have formed in the early solar system			1
however others believe they formed much more recently when a moon was gravitationally ripped apart , while some say an unknown recycling process may keep them looking fresh .			0

scientists at @entity26 say rings could have an ancient origin
it had been thought the *cleanliness* of the rings meant they formed recently
but evidence shows that there just is n't much pollution for them to collect
this means they could have formed up to 4.4 billion years ago
evidence for this comes from water - ice in the rings that must have formed in the early solar system
