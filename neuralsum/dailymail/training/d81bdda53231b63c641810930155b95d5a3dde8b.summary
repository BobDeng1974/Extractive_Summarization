by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 ’s @entity2 at last delivered the victory they needed so badly against @entity5 - but he is still awaiting an assurance that he will remain captain through their @entity8 winter			1
@entity9 ’s career - best 113 came to @entity3 ’s aid , underpinning a total of 294 for seven which @entity2 safely defended thanks principally to early wickets and economy from @entity16 - and despite half - centuries from the world champions ’ @entity19 ( 87 ) and @entity20 ( 53 )			1
the eventual margin of 41 runs did not flatter the hosts , who were significantly the better team throughout at @entity25 - if not so overwhelmingly as @entity5 have been elsewhere on their way to their 3 - 1 @entity28 victory			1
doubt : @entity3 does not know if he 'll be captain when @entity2 travel to @entity31 captain cook : @entity2 's skipper scored 46 as @entity2 cruised to victory on friday at @entity25 leader : @entity3 gives a team - talk during the @entity28 one - day match against @entity5 @entity3 therefore concludes his eventful , and often stressful , summer by avoiding a whitewash with a consolation win			1
asked if he has been told already , however , that he will definitely stay in charge when the selectors name their squad later this month for seven one - day internationals in @entity31 , @entity3 said : “ no , i have n’t			1
” he can only hope so , but with a little more confidence than he perhaps had on the journey north to @entity47 this week after @entity2 ’s previous trouncing at @entity49			2
“ we did ( badly need to win ) , ” he added			2
“ it becomes slightly frustrating - because if you play like that , you ’ll win a lot more games			2
“ we did a lot of things very well , and a lot of things we know we had to do and have n’t been doing in previous games - like one of those guys , top four or five going on and getting a big score , and then the others can support him			2
” @entity9 ’s methods were an endorsement for the tactics @entity2 intend to stick to , especially at home - top - order batsmen backing themselves to play long innings , and accelerating with wicket resources intact			1
consolation : @entity2 restored some pride by beating @entity5 on friday , but still lost the series 3 - 1 top scorer : @entity9 was @entity2 's success story on friday , scoring a career - high 113 many pundits have been loquacious in their criticism , advising more adventure			1
but @entity3 said : “ in these conditions , two new balls and 10.30 starts at @entity25 , it ’s going to do a little bit early on - and it ’s very naive to think you can just whack it straight away			1
“ there is a certain way you have to play			0
” as for his continued tenure as captain , he repeated a near season - long mantra which extends back to the pressure he was under too before @entity2 turned round the test series against @entity5			1
he said : “ there has n’t been a press conference i ’ve been in all summer when someone has n’t mentioned my future as captain ... and i always give the ( same ) answer - while i still want to do the job and believe i can , then i ’ll carry on doing it			2
“ if they do n’t want me to , then i ’ll take it on the chin			0
” @entity3 has good reason to be grateful to @entity9 , whose hundred on his home ground - and century stand with @entity106 - gained the day			1
“ @entity107 obviously was the difference			0
you can get two or three guys getting 20 , 30s and 40s if someone else goes on and gets a hundred off 100 balls , ” he said			0
“ you can speak about it enough , and get told you ’ve got the wrong tactics			0
but it ’s not the wrong tactics - it ’s just people not doing their job very well			0
“ we have n’t for three games , but we did today			0
” high : @entity9 ( left ) celebrates his century against @entity5 at @entity25 trophy : @entity5 beat @entity2 3 - 1 overall in the @entity28 one - day series @entity9 reached a strike rate of 100 plus only deep into his innings			1
@entity3 said : “ it was a fantastic hundred ... to score a run - a - ball on that wicket			2
you saw a lot of the other guys struggle to do that			0
“ if we do that , we ’re a tough side to beat			0
“ it ’s very easy talking about it - everyone knows about it - but actually doing it is a lot harder			0
” @entity3 ’s opposite number @entity144 found himself in the unaccustomed position of trying to explain an @entity147 defeat			2
he said : “ three hundred was par score today , and we gave away quite a few soft wickets in the middle order			0
confusion : @entity2 's @entity153 ( right ) and @entity9 ( left ) almost collide during the fifth odi “ we lost too many wickets and were not in position to chase the runs , so those dismissals really cost us the game			1
” @entity144 has another chance to finish @entity5 ’s tour with a win , in sunday ’s @entity162 back at @entity49			2
@entity3 , by contrast , signs off with minor encouragement after series defeats in both tests and odis against @entity31 , and a win and a loss against @entity5			1
“ the bottom line is we have lost a series , ” he said , before reflecting on a decidedly mixed first season of his and coach @entity172 ’ new era			0
“ i feel tired , ” he said			0
“ when we ’ve played well , we ’ve played really well - and when we ’ve played badly , we ’ve played pretty badly as well			0
“ it ’s always interesting ( in this job ) , and this is just another interesting summer			0
” tradition : @entity2 captain cook tosses the coin pre-match , alongside @entity5 captain @entity144 tactics : @entity2 captain cook ( left ) directs his fielders with @entity16 ( right )			1
