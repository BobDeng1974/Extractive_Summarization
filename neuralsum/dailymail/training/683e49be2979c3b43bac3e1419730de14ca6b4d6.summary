i thought we had seen everything in this @entity3 , but that first half was absolutely unbelievable			1
i wrote on monday that i feared for @entity5			1
yes , they have talent but they have been playing off the cuff and relying on pure passion to get them through			2
and it finally caught up with them			0
the @entity14 were their first proper test but they are a good team , not a great team			0
@entity5 were utterly shambolic and made them look like world - beaters			1
after two minutes he was charging around in the final third like a striker and he has no interest in his defensive duties			1
ending in tears : @entity47 is confronted by @entity58 at the final whistle out of place : @entity29 was often caught of position during the 90 minutes leading with the arm : @entity29 attempts to fend off @entity63 with an elbow in the first half by the end of the first half he looked like he ’d given up			1
it ’s all well and good scoring 35 - yard free - kicks , but i want my defenders to defend			0
he was badly at fault for the first goal and did not look much like a £ 50million defender			0
no case for the defence the @entity5 defence was appalling , but three of the back four would rather play elsewhere			1
i thought @entity79 was finished after he was terrorised by @entity80 and @entity29 and @entity81 want to play in midfield			0
elsewhere they looked slow and @entity35 has to shoulder a lot of the blame			1
yes they missed @entity87 and @entity58 , but they have been disorganised all tournament			0
they finally met a side who could exploit that			0
not up to it : @entity79 was found out by the @entity14 attack @entity96 @entity5 completely lost it in the first half but credit the @entity14			1
so often you see teams collapse but the opposition ca n’t take full advantage			0
they were absolutely ruthless in front of goal			0
two good : @entity106 celebrates his brace as @entity20 cruised to victory video specialist @entity63 in @entity111 we would have written off @entity63 by now for being too old			2
his selection will have raised eyebrows in @entity20 but it shows imagination from @entity115 to pick a specialist and proves @entity20 have the perfect blend of youth and experience			2
@entity120 : @entity20 highlights record breaker : @entity63 scores his 16th goal in @entity123 to become the all time top scorer			2

@entity20 were unbelievable in the first half but @entity5 were shambolic
@entity47 looked *uninterested* in his defensive duties
@entity35 must take the blame for this defeat
