deep in a forest crowded by @entity8 paperback trees , @entity1 hunters @entity2 and @entity3 , a father and son team , are doing one of the most dangerous jobs in the world – they 're out tracking crocodiles			1
it ’s eerily silent , save for the screeching of tropical birds , when @entity3 shouts : ‘ look , crocodiles ! ’ nothing can be seen beyond mud and what little water is left in the small billabong			1
but they take off running past a herd of water buffalo and before you know it @entity2 has his shotgun pointed at the surface			2
@entity29 hunter @entity28 of the @entity31 people drags a crocodile he has just shot dead out of a billabong near @entity34 @entity2 treads carefully as the water rises to his knees , seeming for a moment to lose sight of his prey			1
then in one swift action he steps back , takes aim and shatters the outback calm , and a crocodile , with a single booming shotgun blast			0
it ’s just all part of @entity2 ’s daily life along with the other @entity29 in the northern-most tip of the @entity48 , @entity8 's rugged ‘ @entity49 ’			0
this @entity53 reserve – closer to @entity50 than @entity51 – covers an area of around 97,000 sq km , has a population of around 16,000 people			0
@entity8 's @entity57 are the custodians of the longest unbroken cultural tradition on @entity60 , having migrated down under from @entity61 via @entity62 between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago , and connection to the land is practically written into their dna			0
@entity28 carries the crocodile he has just shot dead along the edge of a billabong @entity3 lifts a baby crocodile above his head after capturing it at a billabong near @entity34 @entity28 stands with his son @entity3 who carries a baby crocodile on his shoulders @entity3 carries an @entity8 native lizard called a goanna over his shoulder that he has just killed hunting crocodiles is also very much part of @entity2 ’ dna			1
this particular hunt took place on foot from @entity34 , located on the outskirts of the community of @entity86 in @entity87			1
it 's a community consisting of around a dozen houses , and lead to the isolated billabong			0
blazing sun and temperatures reaching 40 degrees celsius could n’t even deter @entity2 , and at his feet is the dead crocodile			2
@entity2 had pulled the beast from the water , while @entity3 kept lookout			1
but not far from the shoreline the water starts moving			0
suddenly @entity3 pounces and , from just beneath the surface , he pulls another crocodile , this one a bleating baby			1
@entity29 hunter @entity28 sits by a billabong and cuts up a crocodile he just shot dead the dead crocodile is cut in half by @entity28 to make it easier to carry @entity2 ’s nervous now about crossing the billabong carrying a heavy dead crocodile , but he wanders downstream and grabs a boat hidden in the bushes			1
using a stick as a paddle he navigates the boat , throwing the two crocs onto the muddy shore			0
‘ it 's easier to carry them without all that skin , ’ says @entity2			0
any butcher would have been extremely impressed with the skill he showed at filleting this massive beast			0
the baby was carried out alive			2
before leaving , @entity2 wraps the intestines in leaves , as nothing that can be eaten is wasted , and he and his sons walk the few kilometres back to the car with crocodile meat and a goanna lizard slung over their shoulders			2
creeping slowly across a billabong , @entity28 hunts a crocodile near @entity34 using a stick , @entity28 tries to coax a crocodile out into the open so he can get a clear shot at him			2

@entity138 and @entity3 are a father and son team who *specialise* in killing crocs
the hunt took place on foot from @entity34 , on the outskirts of @entity86 in @entity87
after @entity2 shoots one crocodile his son @entity3 pulls a baby one from the water nearby
@entity2 skilfully cuts the crocodile into fillets , while the baby is carried out alive by @entity3
