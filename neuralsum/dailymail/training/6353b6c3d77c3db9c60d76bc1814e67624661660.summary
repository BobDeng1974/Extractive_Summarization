@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity3 's @entity2 deserved to win last season 's manager of the year ahead of his @entity1 predecessor @entity6			1
after winning promotion from the championship , @entity2 steered @entity3 to a 16th - placed finish in the top flight and led the club to its first ever @entity13 final			1
he was beaten to the top manager 's prize , however , by @entity6 , who rescued @entity1 from the bottom three and guided the @entity1 to 11th			1
' i know @entity34 got manager of the year but i thought @entity2 was head and shoulders the best manager around , ' @entity0 said			1
' to make a club like @entity3 very comfortable in the @entity38 and to get to the fa cup final - i thought that was fantastic			1
' he 's done an incredible job and he 's got fabulous support from his chairman too			0
' i know the chairman gets criticism but there are n't many teams in the bottom half who have had as much money put in as @entity3			2
' he 's been fantastic and they 've bought some very good players			0
' @entity0 arrived at @entity53 at the end of august and @entity1 are unbeaten in the league since he took over			1
an impressive 3 - 2 victory at @entity57 was followed by a 2 - 0 win at home to @entity60 last weekend , which sees the @entity1 sitting ninth in the table			1
' i 've got nothing to lose and i want my players to enjoy it and not be frightened of expressing themselves in the right areas , ' @entity0 said			0
@entity2 and @entity6 embrace during @entity3 's clash with @entity1 at @entity53 last season ' everyone has got strengths - i 'm very lucky because you could n't ask for more effort and commitment			1
' as a @entity1 fan that 's the minimum you require - you want your players to sweat blood and that 's what they 're doing			2
' the fans get behind the players because they know they 're trying their hardest			0
' it was a difficult start to the season but since then we 've worked very hard and we 're getting the rewards			0
' @entity0 allowed 20 - year - old @entity87 to join @entity88 on a 93 - day loan deal this week			2
@entity87 , who spent three months with the @entity88 at the end of last season , has not started a league game for @entity1 in the current campaign			0
' there were four or five clubs after him - i just know @entity97 ( @entity98 ) will play him in the hole where i want him to play and he enjoyed it at @entity88 last season as well , ' @entity0 said			2
' he knows i 'm watching him and he 's playing in the position i think he 's better in			0
' he 's in my plans and he 's going to be a very important player for @entity1 long term			0

@entity0 believes his predecessor @entity6 should n't have received the manager of the year award last season
the @entity1 boss *insists* @entity3 boss @entity2 should have received the *accolade* ahead of @entity6
@entity2 led the @entity112 to a 16th - placed finish last term whereas @entity6 guided the @entity1 to an impressive 11th in the @entity38
