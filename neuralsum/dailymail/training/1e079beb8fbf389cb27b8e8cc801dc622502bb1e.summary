' she and her husband , 41 , took more than 500 photographs , fearing each picture could be their last			1
they saved cards from well - wishers and family , to add to the memory box			1

the memory box is now a record of @entity2 's incredible fight for life , mrs @entity2 said ' she was put straight on @entity108 - a machine that works by creating a circuit , so the blood can circulate bypassing the heart			1

' @entity167 estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the @entity172 and @entity173			0
this means that every day nine people become ill with the disease			2
with one in ten people dying , a death will occur almost every day			0
a further two people will be left with life - altering after effects as severe as brain damage , deafness and multiple amputations			1
meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection , but they are not yet available for all forms			0
so it 's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia			0
symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia : other signs in babies : septicaemia can occur with or without meningitis			0
not everyone gets all the symptoms and they can appear in any @entity204 : @entity167			0
