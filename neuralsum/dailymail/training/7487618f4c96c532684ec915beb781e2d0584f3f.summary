by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 11 january 2013 a fast food lover who ate takeaways every night has gone from fat to fit after she embarked upon a healthy eating regime and took up regular exercise			1
now she is so addicted to working out that she has become a competitive body builder			2
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , who weighed 15st , completely abandoned her former unhealthy lifestyle , transforming her body to become a muscular bodybuilder			1
and last year , after losing seven stone , 43 - year - old @entity7 began regularly competing in bodybuilding competitions for the first time			1
after starting with spin classes , @entity7 became a dedicated gym bunny , concentrating on weight training and diet @entity7 , 43 , said : ' i ca n't believe how much my life has changed			1
i went from eating takeaways every night to attending spin classes six times a week			1
' i feel so much healthier , and i absolutely love competing			2
' it 's strange because when you do the work you do n't immediately see the change in your body			0
but then i won most improved in miss @entity31 - the @entity35 's first ever beauty and fitness pageant - and it spurred me on			1
' after starting with spin classes , @entity7 became a dedicated gym bunny , concentrating on weight training and diet - she even has an impressive six pack as proof of her hard work			1
@entity7 was forced to take control of her weight after an appointment at her local hospital			1
@entity7 was forced to take control of her weight after an appointment at her local hospital ' i 'd been in and out of hospital with gallstones and found out that i was going to need surgery to remove them			1
' i went to the doctor for a pre-surgery consultation when i was asked to jump on the scales			2
' i hated weighing myself anyway , but when i saw that i weighed almost 15st i was humiliated			2
' then the the doctor looked up at me and said ' never mind , we 'll get you back to your fish and chips in no time			2
' ' it was so embarrassing but it was the motivation i need to sort myself out , i knew right then and there that things need to change ! ' just four months after she began weights @entity7 's trainer suggested she enter a competition @entity7 vowed to start using the gym membership that she 'd had for years , and two weeks after her surgery she finally attended her first class			1
' i had originally signed up to a legs , bums and tums class , but when i turned up i was the only one there			0
' the instructor thought it was pointless to do a class on my own so she took me along to a spin class that was going on at the same time			0
' as soon as i got on the bike i loved it ! the lively music and great energy in the room just had me hooked			0
' the music definitely helps you forget the pain you 're in too ! ' in the space of just five months @entity7 had lost four dress sizes , going down from a size 20 to a size 12			1
she was at the gym so much that she even began teaching classes there			2
but @entity7 found she struggled to shift any more weight on exercise alone , and began a strict regime of clean eating to lose even more			1
' clean eating is where you only eat complex carbohydrates , healthy fats , lean protein and about four litres of water every day			0
@entity7 is now teaching her own classes to inspire others to follow in her footsteps ' it really worked for me and i lost even more weight			1
' but unhappy with her now very slender frame , @entity7 began weight training to give more shape to her body			1
' when i was a size six i was so scrawny and just did n't feel comfortable			2
i was too slim and scrawny and i could n't find any clothes to fit me			0
' i started weight training just to give me a few extra curves , but i ended up really enjoying it			1
' it meant i could eat even more too			0
i still keep to the clean eating diet , but i eat about 3,000 calories which includes seven small meals and four protein shakes			0
' when i look back on what i was like before and i do n't know how i let myself get into such bad shape ' ' four months after i began weights my trainer suggested i should enter a competition			0
i love a challenge so i jumped at the chance			0
' i entered my first competition but i was told i needed time to build up my myself - so i took a break and this year i was ready to compete regularly			2
' i won my first title , @entity134 , at @entity135 in may this year			0
' it was incredible to be rewarded for all my hard work ! ' i was self - conscious about my muscles at first , i know some people might think it strange for a woman to be so muscular , but as soon as people started complimenting me on my hard work i was n't bothered at all			2
' i feel really proud of what i 've managed to achieve			0
' @entity7 now hopes teaching her own classes will inspire others to follow in her footsteps			1
' when i tell my students how big i was before they do n't believe me			0
' they ca n't recognise me in pictures and are shocked at how i lost so much			0
' but i 'm living proof that it can be done , and i get so proud when i see people who have used me as their inspiration			0
' i look back on what my life was like before and i do n't know how i let myself get into such bad shape			0
' people used to shout at me from across the street , and i was just dismissed as a fat girl			0
' now i 'm confident , happy and most importantly healthy			0
i 'm planning on continuing my fit life , and i ca n't for the next competition ! ' @entity7 's vital statistics age : 35 height : 5 ' 3 " weight : 207.2 lbs body fat : 49 % age : 43 height : 5 ' 3 " weight : 116.8 lbs body fat : 12 % thanks to @entity166			1
