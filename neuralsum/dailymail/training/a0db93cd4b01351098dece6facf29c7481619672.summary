but we did find out that we had something			2
' the pair also say their families had no problems with the unusual match with @entity2 telling @entity17 that @entity7 's son - who is older than he is - even calls him @entity43			1

' i told him to leave me because it would mean he could n't have children - but thank god he did n't , ' she said			0
@entity7 needs a walking aid to get around and she said her lack of mobility can be frustrating			1

love : the pair say it was love at first sight for both of them and reveal they could n't be happier he explains : ' i have physically disabilities which mean my body has aged faster than someone else my age			1

people will say you are too old to wear something like that leave it to the younger people but that 's not how i feel			2
