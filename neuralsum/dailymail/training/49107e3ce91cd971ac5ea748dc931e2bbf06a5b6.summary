when a player gets a high racing score , that race is recorded and players can race against the fastest car until they beat their high score			2
@entity7 's father was the last one to gain a high score so he is able to play against his father as many times as he wanted as long as he did n't beat his score			1
' so i played and played , and played , until i was almost able to beat the ghost			0
until one day i got ahead of it , i surpassed it , and ... - i stopped right in front of the finish line , just to ensure i wouldnt delete it , ' wrote @entity7			0
one thing that wo n't be deleted is his father 's memory			2

@entity8 user 00wartherapy00 lost his father aged 6
10 years later he discovered he could play against his father in a racing video game
the xbox game ' @entity20 ' records a user 's highest scoring race and other users can play against the winning car to try and beat it
since @entity81 's father was the last one to win , the @entity8 user can play against his dad 's ' ghost ' as long as he does n't beat his score
