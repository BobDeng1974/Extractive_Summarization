@entity0 and @entity1 ' instantly bonded ' over being misfits in a small town of deeply religious conformists in @entity5 , @entity6 dressed in skintight jeans and cowboy hats , the two best friends jumped on to the stage in the crowded country and western bar and brought the house down with a rousing version of the 80s classic @entity16			1
one , a gorgeous blonde , would go on to pose for @entity18			2
the other , a striking 6ft 3in brunette , transformed herself from small - town @entity1 into the exotic @entity1 , world famous fashion designer and lover of @entity22			1
but on that night in 1984 they were both bubbly 20 - year - olds , full of the joys of life and anxious to break free from their small - town @entity30 roots			1
while many this week have speculated on the reason @entity1 chose to end her life at her own hand , her best friend from school @entity0 - who shared her early anxieties , hopes and dreams - said she believes the truth is simple : ‘ she lost touch with herself and she had no foundation or real friends to fall back on			1
' the @entity1 i knew was full of life and passion			1
she was always laughing and smiling			2
when you look at pictures of @entity1 she always looks so uptight , like she has the weight of the world on her shoulders			1
i think @entity1 created this alter - ego and did amazingly well but deep down she knew it was all an illusion			1
‘ when we jumped on that stage in the country bar that was the real @entity1 , a girl who loved life			1
as @entity1 she had money , fame and a rock star as a boyfriend but she was miserable			1
’ @entity0 , 49 , who now works in a gentleman ’s club in @entity65 , @entity66 , said she and @entity1 ‘ instantly bonded ’ over being misfits in a small town of deeply religious conformists in @entity5 , @entity6			1
‘ her parents @entity70 and @entity72 were devout @entity30 and adopted @entity1 and her brother and sister			1
i got to know her when we moved into the house behind theirs when i was 16 , ' she said			0
‘ @entity1 and i bonded because we did n’t buy the whole @entity30 religion thing			1
we were considered " wild " because we had original thoughts			0
by today ’s standards our rebellion was tame			0
we never touched drugs , we shared the occasional beer and for all our bravado we were terrified of sex			0
‘ we made out with two boys in the back of an @entity88 at a football game once but that was as wild as it got			2
@entity1 ’s legs were so long they were sticking out the back window and by the time we were done there was three inches of snow on her feet			1
‘ she was already well over six foot and that was excruciatingly hard for her			0
she hated standing out that much but there was nothing she could do about it			0
i was different too , with my dreams of being a glamour model and actress			0
‘ @entity1 could n’t relate to her family			1
we had to do all the @entity106 things like going to @entity107 and baking cookies but we never bought into it			0
‘ she was adopted which made her insecure			0
her exotic looks made her stand out			2
she ’d say to me : " where do you think i came from ? " ‘ she had a sense of not fitting in , never truly belonging			0
’ ' as @entity1 she had money , fame and a rock star as a boyfriend but she was miserable ' the two girls poured over fashion magazines like @entity123 and @entity124 and talked long into the night about running away to @entity125 to seek their fame and fortune			1
she said : ‘ @entity1 would get depressed over her height and people teasing her and i ’d comfort her and say : " do n’t worry , those legs will make you a famous model one day			1
" they would create their own fashions from second hand clothes - ‘ @entity1 was always so talented at making something beautiful from a thrift store purchase ’ - and would hang out with the only two gay boys in @entity5 , a town of less than 40,000 , 32 miles north of the @entity6 capital @entity143			1
@entity0 recalled : ‘ i remember sitting on the steps of @entity1 ’s house and looking at a magazine and there was @entity148 with @entity149 and she said to me : “ how glamorous is that ? how great is her life , jetting the world and dating a rock star ? " back then if you ’d told her she ’d end up dating the most famous rock star in the world she would have thrown that head of curls back and roared with laughter			1
‘ we ’d sneak off to @entity143 and a gay club called @entity165 and groove all night to @entity166 ’s night to remember and be giddy with joy			0
’ at graduation in 1982 the two friends ordered cheetah - print thongs from a catalogue and wore them under their yellow graduation gowns			2
‘ after the ceremony we ripped off our gowns and went running half - naked down the corridors			2
that pretty much sealed our reputation			0
‘ we never had boyfriends			0
the local boys were all good @entity30 kids			2
they stuck to the rules , went to church , wanted to get married and have babies			2
@entity1 and i wanted out			1
’ ' @entity1 would get depressed over her height and people teasing her and i 'd comfort her and say : " do n't worry , those legs will make you a famous model one day " ' at 18 , @entity0 travelled west to @entity190			1
a chance meeting at a party landed her some modeling work and she ended up working for several years as a successful @entity18 bunny and centrefold , landed bit - parts in b - movies and dated @entity199 ’s ex-lover , billionaire @entity198			2
@entity0 said : ' @entity1 followed me to @entity190 and came to stay with me in my tiny apartment			1
we had the greatest fun			0
i remember @entity198 saying all we girls needed was a tight pair of jeans and heated rollers			0
with those two things we ’d get in anywhere			0
’ while @entity1 ’s expensive pr machine would eventually ‘ create ’ an official biography - which claimed she was spotted by photographer @entity210 on the street and was whisked off to @entity212 as a fashion model at 18 after graduating from school			1
@entity0 said the reality was far different : ‘ she found it hard to get work as a model			2
she was too tall and too exotic looking			2
she worked in a boutique at the @entity220 ( an @entity190 shopping mall ) , as a travel agent and as an aerobics instructor			0
' she could n’t get work			0
then one day she met a photographer who did some amazing shots of her			0
‘ she came home so excited and said : ‘ " hey want me to change my name to something exotic to match my looks			2
" ‘ when she told me the name i said : " @entity232 , like @entity233 ? " and she said , " no , @entity1 like an exotic bird			1
" ‘ they tagged on @entity237 for no other reason except it sounded good			0
’ the pair ‘ partied together ’ , dated brothers and enjoyed the @entity190 scene : ‘ @entity1 ’s career was taking off and she wanted to go to @entity212			1
then we had a silly row and she took off ...			0
and i never heard from her again			0
' that was how she was			0
she reinvented herself and never looked back			2
she was so desperate to be successful that as soon as she moved on she forgot about those people she ’d left behind			0
’ @entity0 said another friend from that time started a successful art gallery on @entity190 ’s trendy @entity250			1
‘ she ’d know @entity1 in the early days too			2
a couple of years ago @entity1 walked into the gallery and @entity253 said : " my @entity255 , it ’s you @entity1 ! " ' but @entity1 just looked at her coldly , turned on her heel and walked out			1
she did n’t want to be reminded of her past			0
’ ' she was driven to succeed , to put @entity6 as far behind her as possible			0
so she kept reinventing and reinventing herself ' @entity1 reinvented herself as a model , then successful designer and , for the past 13 years , as @entity22 ’s confidante , lover and muse			1
@entity0 worked in @entity264 as a showgirl before moving to @entity66 to work as an exotic dancer			1
as she watched the video of her and @entity1 - taken in the @entity268 in @entity269 , @entity6 , in 1984 - she feels a mixture of emotions : ‘ ' for years i assumed @entity1 came back from @entity212 , got married and had kids			1
' i think that ’s what would have made her happy			0
it would have given her the stability and sense of family and belonging she always craved			0
' she was always a girl who longed to fit in , who wanted to belong and know where she came from			2
‘ she was driven to succeed , to put @entity6 as far behind her as possible			0
so she kept reinventing and reinventing herself			0
' but along the way she " lost " @entity1			1
the tragedy is the girl i knew loved life and had big dreams			2
she chased those dreams but ended up losing her soul			0

@entity1 turned herself from a small - town girl into the exotic @entity1 , world famous fashion designer and @entity22 **'s** lover
she and @entity0 wanted to break free from their small - town @entity30 roots
@entity0 believes the truth behind her friend **'s** death is simple : ' she lost touch with herself and she had no foundation or real friends to fall back on '
