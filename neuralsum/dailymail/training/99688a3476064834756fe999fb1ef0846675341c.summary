a confidential call between the @entity1 and @entity2 was recorded by hacking group @entity3 - the very people they were trying to catch , it was revealed today			1
the group released a 15 - minute tape of what appears to be a conference call last month about tracking and prosecuting the group ’s members			1
the top - secret conversation begins with a bizarre exchange between the @entity15 and @entity17 agents , where they talk about cheese and eating ' @entity19 at the @entity20 '			2
there is also one point when ' @entity38 ' , the @entity15 agent , says to the @entity17 agent ' @entity39 ' : ' i 'm not sure if we 're the only two on right now or not '			0
@entity3 also published a top secret email apparently sent by an @entity1 agent , which gave details and a password for accessing the call			1
the cyber raid is the most audacious and sinister yet to be carried out by the shadowy hacking group and shows how powerful @entity3 has become			1
and in a display of their growing reach , @entity3 also claimed credit for hacking the websites of the police forces in @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 , @entity58			1
this came hours after they attacked the @entity61 @entity63 site			1
‘ the @entity1 might be curious how we 're able to continuously read their internal comms for some time now , ’ the group tweeted			2
investigation : those on the call talk about legal strategies in the cases of @entity71 , left , and @entity72 , right - two @entity17 suspects linked to @entity3 the recording , which has since been verified by the @entity1 , appears to have been edited to bleep out the names of some suspects being discussed			1
the @entity1 said the information ‘ was intended for law enforcement officers only and was illegally obtained			1
’ ' a criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible ' @entity1 spokesman ‘ a criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible , ’ the law - enforcement bureau added			2
' we are aware of the video , which relates to an @entity1 conference call involving a @entity91 ( @entity91 ) representative , ' @entity86 's @entity85 said on friday			1
' the matter is being investigated by the @entity1			0
at this stage no operational risks to the @entity94 have been identified - however , we continue to carry out a full assessment			0
' amid the material published by @entity3 was a message purportedly sent by an @entity1 agent to international law enforcement agencies			1
it invites his foreign counterparts to join the call to ‘ discuss the on - going investigations related to @entity3 and other associated splinter groups ’			2
@entity107 : the group gloated on @entity109 as they released a recording of what appears to be a conference call last month about prosecuting their members the email to officials in the @entity17 , @entity116 , the @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 had a phone number and password for accessing the call			1
but only @entity15 and @entity17 officials can be heard on the recording			0
neither the @entity1 agent nor others coded in on the call have commented			1
the conference call dial - in details were reportedly sent in an email to officials and someone forwarded it to a private , non-government email account which was compromised at some point			1
' if they have n't secured their email it could potentially prejudice the investigation ' @entity138 , lawyer for @entity71 , linked with @entity3 the email released by the hackers that appears to be the one the @entity1 sent out to organise the teleconference asked all participants to use a single code to gain entry to the call			1
the call would have been more secure if attendees had each been assigned unique access codes and been required to identify themselves by name upon dialling in , law enforcement sources said			1
if a hacker had dialled in with a unique access code and made it past initial screening , the organisers may have identified a breach when it became clear two parties were using the same dial - in			0
those on the call talk about what legal strategy to pursue in the cases of @entity71 and @entity72 - two @entity17 suspects linked to @entity3			2
they also discuss evidence against other suspects			0
@entity138 , a lawyer for @entity71 , said the recording could be ‘ incredibly sensitive ’			0
embarrassment : the @entity1 's headquarters are seen in @entity171 on friday she warned the breach could derail police work			2
‘ if they have n't secured their email it could potentially prejudice the investigation , ’ she said			0
@entity3 is an amorphous collection of online enthusiasts , pranksters and activists whose targets have included the @entity184			2
' the @entity1 might be curious how we 're able to continuously read their internal comms for some time now ' @entity3 , on @entity109 they have also run attacks against the music industry , and financial companies such as @entity190 and @entity191			2
following a spate of arrests globally , the group and its various offshoots have focused their attention on law enforcement , especially the @entity1			1
data security expert @entity198 said hackers were able to eavesdrop on the call because they had compromised an investigator 's emails			0
‘ the very people that ( police ) are trying to apprehend , could have been tuning in to their internal conversations , ’ he wrote in a blog post			0
intercepted call : a view of @entity2 , the headquarters of the @entity85 meanwhile , a message posted on the @entity55 police website on friday said : ' @entity3 hacks @entity215 website in retaliation for police brutality at @entity218 ( @entity218 ) '			1

the hack was apparently a protest against the @entity61 government 's signing of the @entity228 ( @entity228 ) , which is designed to reduce internet piracy			0
the group has unleashed havoc on several @entity233 governments during the past month			0
@entity55 's @entity234 set up camp in the city 's financial district for two months last autumn , but police dismantled it in december , citing public health and safety concerns			2
the hackers in @entity58 gained access to sensitive data , including citizen complaints about drug crimes , phone numbers , addresses and other personal information , police said			0
‘ we 're still knee deep in trying to get a feel for the extent of the problem , ’ @entity57 police detective @entity250 said on friday afternoon			0
' a law enforcement agency using unencrypted , unsecure communications is a major fumble , ' said @entity258 , who spent years securing communications for the @entity260			2
‘ what if this event was talking about some terrorist plot to blow up something and “ they ” were listening in ? it could 've been much worse if it was related to an @entity263 plot or something			0
’ a preliminary conversation is heard between @entity17 and @entity15 law enforcement agencies before they discuss the operations against @entity3 : ' please enter your passcode followed by the # key or * 0 to speak with an operator			1
your passcode has been confirmed			0
please wait while you are joined to the conference ' ' hello ? '' hey @entity39 ? hey , it 's @entity38 , how 're you doing ? '' alright			0
i 'm not sure if we 're the only two on right now or not '' @entity38 , do n't say anything too bad - i 'm here with @entity285 '' do you wan na talk about cheese ? '' cheese ? what about that @entity27 's at the @entity20 eh ? i 've told so many people			0
no - one believes me ' then the @entity17 law enforcement agent ' @entity39 ' speaks about their investigations : see video here @entity3 is a notorious group of hackers around the world who have no central authority			1
masked : @entity3 has hit the headlines in the past for shutting down websites the group was in the news last month for briefly shutting down the @entity1 and @entity305 websites in the @entity15 after popular file - sharing website @entity307 was closed down			1
