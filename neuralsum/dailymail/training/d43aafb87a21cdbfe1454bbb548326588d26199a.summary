a multi-million - pound scheme to increase massively the number of elite teachers parachuted into @entity4 ’s toughest schools will be announced by the government tomorrow			0
the funding will help train 2,000 top graduates a year to teach in schools in inner cities and other deprived parts of the country			1
the money , to be unveiled by education secretary @entity13 , is the latest tranche granted by the government to the charity @entity16 , which was set up to woo high - flyers to swap lucrative city jobs for the classroom			1
education secretary @entity13 , pictured , will unveil the new funding on monday to train 2,000 top graduates the government said tens of thousands of children from disadvantaged backgrounds would benefit because the charity operates only in schools where at least half the pupils come from the poorest third of families in @entity29			1
mr @entity13 said : ‘ the quality of teachers has a greater influence on children ’s achievement than any other aspect of their education			1
every pupil , regardless of their background , deserves high - quality teaching in order to succeed in life			0
@entity16 helps get some of our brightest graduates into some of our most challenging classrooms			1
we are committed to supporting the charity in its efforts to reach more schools			2
’ founded by former @entity49 business consultant @entity48 in 2002 , @entity16 takes on only high - calibre graduates who have a 2:1 degree or above and trainees must go through a rigorous assessment process and intensive two - year training programme			2
the government said that tens of thousands of children from disadvantaged backgrounds would benefit from the latest tranche of funding , which was granted to the charity @entity16 @entity16 is already the biggest recruiter from @entity60 , pictured , and @entity61 so selective is the screening that many of the would - be teachers are weeded out and @entity16 approves only about 12 per cent of applicants			1
the organisation already takes on more than 1,000 graduates a year who want to avoid the traditional teacher - training path , and the new money , expected to be about £ 7 million , will almost double the numbers			2
already the biggest recruiter from @entity60 and @entity61 , the charity will next year become @entity4 ’s biggest graduate recruitment organisation			0
trainees are required to stay in the classroom for only two years , and many sign up to hone skills , such as communication , that they believe will serve them well in future careers			0
but more than half stay in teaching and the most inspirational are fast - tracked into senior roles			0
mr @entity48 welcomed the new government funding and said : ‘ this support is vital to help us achieve our ambitious aim to ensure that no child ’s educational success is limited by their socio - economic background			0
’ the charity already has more than 1,000 graduates a year who want to avoid the traditional teacher - training route though it began in @entity95 and spread to other cities , including @entity97 , the charity is now expanding into coastal and rural schools suffering from disadvantages			2
the new grant , which takes @entity103 support for @entity16 to nearly £ 40 million , is part of mr @entity13 ’s plans to boost education standards by attracting the brightest students into teaching			1
in addition to the @entity16 scheme , graduates with first - class degrees who specialise in subjects in which there is a shortage of teachers , such as maths and science , can be given financial incentives of up to £ 20,000 to train on conventional courses , and former soldiers are also being encouraged to sign up			1
meanwhile , the government has said it will no longer fund the training of graduates who have obtained only a third - class degree			0
new figures show that more than seven out of ten new trainees now have at least a 2:1 – the highest proportion ever recorded			0
the figures also show the quality of trainee teachers has improved in the core subjects where there have traditionally been shortages , including maths , physics , chemistry and modern foreign languages .			0

new funding will be unveiled by education secretary @entity13 on monday to help train up top graduates for the classroom
it is the latest tranche to be awarded to the charity @entity16
