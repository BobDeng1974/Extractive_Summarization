by @entity0 on @entity3 two years ago @entity2 co-founder @entity1 was preparing for a party			1
she ordered dinner to her home using @entity7 , rented a dress via @entity9 , and booked a car using @entity11			0
the one thing she could n't outsource from her phone ? hair and make - up			2
@entity2 aims to fix that			1
book an appointment using their free @entity18 app , and a professional hairstylist will be on your doorstep in an hour with all the equipment needed to create the perfect blow - out			0
they 'll set up anywhere with an outlet and all they ask is that you wash your hair beforehand for easy styling			1
it seemed too good to be true , so , on behalf of @entity33 , i decided to put the service to the test			0
the perfect blow - out : @entity0 's stylist @entity36 arrived at her apartment promptly at 7.30am - and in just 45 minutes , had transformed her damp , straight hair ( left ) into a waterfall of curls ( right ) i had imagined that the construction of a pop - up salon in a @entity44 shoebox apartment would be overwhelming , but in reality it is anything but			1
my stylist , @entity36 , arrived promptly at 7.30am like a @entity47 of hair care and within three minutes of arrival , she was looping and smoothing my hair with a blow dryer			1
between sectioning off pieces she dispensed helpful styling tips , and explained how certain products can help or harm a style			2
' a little volumizing mousse is good ! ' i learned , ' but do n’t tease your roots			0
' after fully drying and pinning my usually poker - straight hair into curls , she doubled back with a curling iron for extra hold			1
all products and tools she used were salon quality - i winced at the sight of my own $ 12 metal curler in the corner			0
finally , she gave my hair a quick spritz of hairspray , shook my head back , and turned me toward the mirror			2
i was completely astounded by the results			0
in just 45 minutes she had transformed my damp , straight hair into a waterfall of curls - barely the time it takes me to get ready			1
easy : the effortless booking process is largely thanks to the app , which features a menu of ten hairstyles including an up - do , two braided looks , and several other options aimed at accommodating different hair types by the time i took my eyes off the mirror , she had packed back up her things and gave me a warm hug goodbye			1
' some women are nervous to let a stylist into their home because they do n't want to create a mess , ' @entity36 explained , ' so we try to make it as easy as possible			1
we do n't leave you with any clean - up			0
' ' some women are nervous to let a stylist into their home because they do n't want a mess , so we try to make it as easy as possible ' given this hyper - efficiency , the service is already proving popular among new moms			1

@entity2 stylists will also happily travel to your office for a blow - out between meetings			1
' we definitely have a strong group of business professionals who are dedicated to the service , ' @entity1 says			0
