by @entity0 published : 19:27 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 3 december 2013 the phone call to @entity3 ’s biographer came a few weeks before the start of the @entity5			1
@entity6 recalls how a reporter from a red - top sunday newspaper was on the phone , asking him about internet rumours that the then 18 - year - old diver was in a long - standing gay relationship with a fellow member of the @entity15 diving team			1
‘ they rang me several times , looking for information about @entity3 ’s sexuality , ’ he told me yesterday			1
revelations : @entity3 has revealed he is dating a man in a heartfelt video message on his @entity25 page supportive : @entity3 posted this image with his mother @entity28 on sunday night with the caption ' so lucky to have such a supportive mum ! i love you ! ' ‘ it surprised me that someone was interested in running that kind of piece so close to an @entity36 , given the effect any scandal might have had on his chances of a medal			1
’ sources close to @entity3 are understood to have also denied rumours of the gay relationship ( which are , indeed , believed to have been unfounded )			1
and no article ever found its way into print			0
in @entity48 a few weeks later , @entity3 won bronze			1
touchingly , he dedicated it to his beloved father and mentor , @entity53 , an electrician who had died , after a long battle with brain cancer , at the end of 2011			0
yet despite the outwardly happy ending , uncomfortable memories of the awkward episode have clearly lingered			0
' he would be happy for me ' : @entity3 insisted his late father @entity53 would be proud of him no matter what indeed , yesterday ’s frank and fearless @entity25 video , in which @entity3 declared : ‘ i ’m dating a guy and i could n’t be happier ’ , marks an effort to blow away a cloud of speculation that had begun to hover over his private life			1
@entity3 , born in an unpretentious suburb of @entity72 , took up diving at the age of seven , and quickly displayed a precocious talent			2
aged ten , he won a national youth title			0
by 12 , he was beating adult pros			0
aged 14 , he was selected for the @entity78 , becoming the second youngest male athlete ever to represent @entity80 at @entity36 level			2
the achievement brought instant celebrity			0
but fame can be a double - edged sword : for like any other child star , he was forced to negotiate the hurdles of adolescence under an unremitting public gaze			0
‘ in common with quite a lot of gay or bisexual men , @entity3 has spent his teenage years wrestling with his sexuality , trying to work out who he actually is , ’ a family friend tells me			1
‘ in his case , that was of course made particularly difficult by the fact that he ’s famous			0
’ with a hectic media schedule , partly attributable to lucrative sponsorship deals with the likes of @entity103 and @entity104 , @entity3 was soon forced to become adept at parrying questions about his romantic life			2
he talked of being ‘ married to my trunks ’ or ‘ too busy ’ for a ‘ proper girlfriend ’			0
on other occasions , he allowed rudimentary details of relationships with girls to appear in print			0
a childhood flame from @entity72 was loosely hinted at			0
and a brief dalliance with @entity119 diver @entity118 , to whom he gave a ‘ proper kiss ’ during the @entity78 , was detailed in his autobiography			0
inevitably , perhaps , his sexuality became a matter of debate in cyberspace , where @entity3 has become a target for gossip and taunts from those apparently jealous of his fame and success			2
but reporters largely refrained from raising the question in interviews			0
sporting hero : @entity36 athlete @entity3 put an end to years of speculation by admitting that he is bisexual still as motivated as ever : @entity3 insisted that the new relationship has done nothing to stop his motivation ahead of the @entity141 in 2016 behind the scenes , @entity3 endured a string of personal setbacks			1
in 2009 it emerged that he was being mercilessly bullied at @entity146 , his state school , where peers called him ‘ diver boy ’ and ‘ @entity149 ’ , and launched attacks that @entity3 ’s family claimed had ‘ a physical dimension ’			1
‘ though @entity3 never said as much , i do feel that the motivation for that bullying had a homophobic element to it , ’ adds @entity6			2
soon after , @entity3 moved to the fee - paying @entity157			1
and in 2011 it emerged that his father @entity53 had been diagnosed with the cancer which would later kill him			0
‘ @entity53 was a laid - back man , ’ says a reporter who knows the family well			1
‘ i do n’t know if @entity3 ever discussed his sexuality with @entity53 , but he ’d have been very supportive			1
’ the death left @entity3 , who has two younger brothers , as the eldest male in his family , and the major breadwinner ( his mother @entity28 is a housewife )			1
@entity170 loves : @entity3 previously dated @entity119 diver @entity171 romance rumours : he was also romantically linked to teammate @entity173 , but she later denied the claims ‘ as a diver , that ’s tricky , because it ’s not a sport where you ordinarily make a huge amount of money , ’ adds the reporter			1
‘ so after the @entity183 , @entity3 began to actively pursue a tv career , and to do that these days , you need a celebrity profile			2
’ in august 2012 @entity3 began stepping out with another @entity119 diver , the @entity187 @entity171			1
he took her to the @entity190 musical in @entity48 ’s @entity191 , and the @entity192 in @entity193			0
late last year he was pictured hand - in - hand with reality tv star @entity195 outside a paparazzi - friendly @entity48 nightclub			2
a public flirtation with singer @entity198 , via @entity199 , generated headlines			0
and there was no lack of female interest in his reality tv show , @entity204 , which attracted six million viewers when it debuted this year			0
setting the record straight : @entity3 insisted he wanted to break the news in a video so his words could not be twisted and his fans would know the truth ' not been an easy decision ' : @entity3 tweeted a link to the video on monday morning on @entity199 , however , there were unpleasant incidents of homophobic abuse which last year led to two arrests			1
his decision to ‘ come out ’ yesterday , with an at times very moving statement on @entity25 , was overwhelmingly well received , with many praising his courage and honesty			2
the former @entity225 rugby star @entity224 , who came out as gay in 2009 , tweeted : ‘ when the dust settles @entity3 will realise today is the start of an amazing life			2
’ i gather that @entity3 ’s management had been considering the move , at his request , for most of the year			1
friends say it ’s been on the cards since june , roughly two months after he began a relationship with his current boyfriend during time off from revising for a-levels ( he achieved three a grades )			0
@entity3 ’s coach @entity242 was one of several members of @entity3 ’s advisers consulted in advance of the move			1
‘ i responded in the same way many other people have done , ’ he tells me			0
‘ i just said , “ congratulations ”			0
’ screen star : @entity3 is also preparing for the second season of @entity204 , and is seen here watching @entity252 prepare for a dive			2

@entity3 revealed the news in a heartfelt video on his @entity25 page
the 19 - year - old admitted he has been dating the man since @entity261
diver said he *'s* ' never been happier ' but insisted he ' still fancies girls '
the @entity36 medallist added that while his mother has been supportive , some of his other family members have ' mixed opinions '
@entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 led the celebrities tweeting their support for @entity3
