by @entity1 reporter a @entity3 man who killed his 13 - year - old neighbor last year testified thursday the shooting was ' justice ' because he thought the teen had broken into his home and stolen weapons			1
@entity10 , 76 , said the suspicion that @entity12 stole expensive shotguns of deep sentimental value left him ' very , very angry			1
' police searched @entity12 ' home after the shooting and did n't find the weapons			1
a prosecutor alleged that @entity10 traded the boy 's life for guns in a desire for revenge			1
@entity10 was sentenced today to life in prison ' i would n't call it revenge			1
i would call it justice , ' @entity10 said defiantly , drawing audible gasps from the courtroom			2
@entity12 ' mother , @entity38 , threw up her hands and muttered , ' @entity40			2
' @entity10 was testifying against the advice of his lawyer			2
defense attorney @entity43 told the judge during morning proceedings that his client had suddenly lost the mental competence to continue with the trial			0
the judge halted proceedings for a few hours until a court - appointed psychiatrist performed a brief examination and pronounced @entity10 competent to continue			1
tragedy : @entity12 was gunned down after his elderly neighbor wrongfully accused him of stealing several guns from his home @entity10 was convicted wednesday of first - degree intentional homicide			1
that verdict advanced the trial to a second phase to determine whether @entity10 was sane at the time of the may 2012 shooting			1
the second phase wrapped up friday with testimony from a doctor hired by the prosecution			0
a doctor retained by the defense testified wednesday that @entity10 had anger issues that caused him to periodically detach from reality			2
ultimately , the jury ruled that @entity10 is competent and he now faces a sentence of life in prison			1
@entity10 did n't testify in the first phase			2
the judge asked him thursday if he wanted to testify in the second phase , and @entity10 said he 'd prefer to give a 15 - minute statement			2
when told he could only address the jury in the form of sworn testimony and cross-examination , he agreed to take the stand			0
@entity10 mostly spoke in a calm voice but sounded anguished as he recounted how he confronted @entity12 and shot him in the chest			1
he recalled that someone had stolen four shotguns from his home two days earlier , and he was frustrated by a limited police response			0
@entity43 asked him what caused him to shoot the boy			0
' i wanted my guns back , ' @entity10 replied , squeezing his eyes shut and resting his head against his fingertips			2
' i just wanted them back so bad			0
' @entity10 never denied shooting @entity12 , and acknowledged wanting to kill the teen 's older brother as well			1
@entity98 , 18 , had rushed into the street to help his wounded brother			0
grieving : @entity38 , @entity12 ' mother , watched as @entity10 killer her son ' if there were n't other people behind him you would have shot him , ' prosecutor @entity104 offered			1
' i would have shot him , ' @entity10 replied			2
the strongest piece of evidence against @entity10 was footage from his own surveillance cameras , which showed him confronting @entity12 on the sidewalk and pointing a handgun at him			1
the boy backpedaled a few steps with his hands up			0
@entity10 then exchanged words with @entity12 ' mother on her porch off screen , and then turned and fired one shot at @entity12 ' chest			1
the teen fled , and @entity10 fired a second shot that missed			2
he tried to shoot a third time but the gun jammed			0
@entity12 died a few moments later across the street , in his mother 's arms			0
@entity43 conceded from the outset that @entity10 killed the boy , but argued during the first phase that the homicide may have been reckless but not intentional , because @entity10 did n't mean for the shot to be fatal			0
the jury deliberated for about an hour wednesday before rejecting that argument			0
support : @entity38 hugs family friend @entity140 at the trial of the man who murdered her son life : @entity10 faces life in prison now that a jury has found him competent @entity10 had entered two pleas to the homicide charge : not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect			1
that set up the trial to be conducted in two phases : the first to determine whether he was guilty of the homicide , and if so , a second to determine whether he was mentally competent at the time			0
while @entity10 did n't deny what he did , he had a hard time explaining to the prosecutor why he did it			0
when @entity104 asked if he took the safety off the gun because he wanted to kill the boy , @entity10 said he did n't know			0
@entity104 asked why @entity10 fired a second time and @entity10 again said he did n't know			0
finally , @entity104 asked whether @entity10 felt bad about taking @entity12 ' life			1
' not that bad , ' he replied softly .			0

@entity26 says he feels ' not that bad ' about killing his 13 - year - old neighbor
@entity10 wrongfully accused 13 - year - old @entity12 of stealing several guns from his home
@entity10 faces a sentence of life in prison after a jury ruled this *afternoon* that he is sane
