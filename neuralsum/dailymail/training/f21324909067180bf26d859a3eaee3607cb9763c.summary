by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 12:07 est , 30 december 2012 the couple attended the @entity2 of ' @entity3 : an @entity4 ' at the @entity5 in @entity6 earlier this month when your long - term partner and father of your two children becomes a bona fide @entity13 star , it ’s hard to imagine what the downside might be			1
but for @entity17 there were definite drawbacks when @entity19 won the part of @entity21 in @entity3 : an @entity4			1
true , it would give them rewards and riches beyond their imagining , but it also meant he would have to spend 18 months in @entity29 filming			1
‘ that trip to @entity29 is a monster – 26 hours and three planes , ’ says @entity17 , 38 , an easy - going , approachable blonde with a hearty laugh and a down - to - earth sense of humour			1
‘ when @entity19 was offered @entity3 , we talked about it and he did think about turning it down			1
’ @entity39 , 41 , did reject the role			0
@entity42 ’s prequel to @entity43 may be the world ’s biggest movie franchise , but the actor was locked into playing @entity47 in another series of @entity49			2
then , in an unprecedented move , the director agreed to halt filming for six weeks so that @entity19 could return to @entity53 to complete the @entity55 drama			1
@entity17 says : ‘ @entity42 said he could n’t think of anyone else to play the part			1
i told @entity19 he had to do it and we would get through it			1
we said we ’d speak to each other on the phone and it would be ok			0
afterwards , we came to the conclusion we ’d never , ever do that again			0
’ @entity19 has had to move to @entity29 while he plays the part of @entity21 in @entity42 's new movie although @entity17 was left behind at their home in @entity72 looking after @entity73 , seven , and four - year - old @entity74 , she insists it was more difficult for @entity19			1
of course being a hobbit is n’t easy			0
there ’s the large feet – it took two people to help @entity19 put on the gnarly , flipper - like appendages that went up to his thighs			1
then there ’s the ears : ‘ i asked him to bring a pair home , ’ says @entity17 , ‘ although he has n’t put them on yet			1
i think he ’s had enough of them for now			2
’ @entity17 has just won her own starring role in @entity94 's new department - store drama mr @entity95 and that ’s not to mention the troll snot			1
@entity19 has said : ‘ because of continuity , you ’ve got to be in wet snot and then the remnants of drying snot			1
that ’s a lot of days			2
it ’s kind of like a hair gel			2
‘ we were on the side of a mountain with wind machines going and rain pouring down , and our wig glue and hair gel was going into our eyes			0
@entity42 would say , “ @entity19 , can you open your eyes a little more ? ” i genuinely could not			1
’ @entity17 , the only child of @entity116 and @entity117 , a cab driver , says : ‘ it was harder for @entity19			1
i had our home and his things around me , whereas he was in a foreign country without his children , without me			0
' i managed to get out three times with the kids			0
then @entity19 came back to film @entity49 and for @entity126 , so we had little pockets of time			1
’ while @entity19 would call home complaining that he ’d been ‘ hanging upside - down all day and i ’ve got bloody ears on ’ , normal life – with all its trials – carried on			1
and one of the hardest moments came when she found a lump in one of her breasts			0
she says : ‘ it turned out to be nothing but it was frightening			0
it ’s not knowing that ’s the scary thing			2
' your immediate reaction is ‘ ‘ that ’s it ’ ’			2
we immediately think the worst			0
i had to steel myself to ring the doctor , then wait a couple of weeks for the results			0
@entity19 was going to come back but i was fine			1
’ @entity19 initially turned down the role of @entity21 but was persuaded after @entity42 agreed to halt filming so he could finish a drama he was working on @entity17 understands the pressures , as she is also an actress			1
while she may be known as mrs @entity155 in some quarters , she has just won her own starring role in @entity94 ’s new department - store drama mr @entity95			1
the ten - part serial is being billed as @entity160 with tills , yet @entity17 admits she very nearly did n’t take the part ( as @entity163 , @entity164 ) because @entity19 was still in @entity29			1
she explains : ‘ i went for the audition and the next day they said , “ you ’ve got it			0
” i dreaded telling @entity19 because i was due to go out there			1
' we had n’t seen each other for four months , which was the longest time we ’d been apart			2
i was having to juggle work , make sure the kids were ok , make sure @entity19 was ok			1
i wondered whether i should do it but @entity19 said , ‘ ‘ you ’ve got to do it			1
’ ’ ’ the pair starred together as a married couple in the 2007 @entity55 drama @entity181 the couple met on the set of a movie called men only in 2000 , although @entity17 had already seen the actor in the sketch show @entity187 and ‘ really fancied him ’			1
it was the year before @entity19 found fame playing hapless @entity191 in @entity192			2
@entity17 says : ‘ i was sitting in the make - up bus moaning about not having a boyfriend when a call went over the radio for @entity19 to have his make - up taken off			1
he walked on to the bus and i thought , “ oh @entity200 , you ’re lovely			0
” ‘ we just sort of ended up hanging out with each other			0
i left early and then got a message from him the next day saying , “ hi , you left and i had n’t finished flirting with you which i thought was a little bit rude			0
i ’ll see you later			0
” ‘ we went out on a date that day to a pub in @entity207			0
it ’s the only time we ’ve ever been to a pub. ‘ we moved in together a few months after that			2
i know it sounds sickly , but he is			0
’ while she enjoys the @entity214 ’s success has given them , she is refreshingly uninterested in the trappings that go with it			2
at the @entity6 premiere of @entity3 a fortnight ago , she wore a dress from @entity220 , while she often drives them to awards ceremonies in her @entity223			0
she recalls : ‘ at the @entity224 last year i was so pleased because i managed to get a parking space within a hundred yards of the red carpet			0
’ @entity42 said he could n't think of anyone else to play the part of the hobbit she does the driving , as @entity19 has n’t passed his test			2
it ’s fair to say that theirs is a household untouched by @entity13 success			2
@entity17 says : ‘ any kind of normality is just heavenly			2
he might change , he ’s still got two hobbit films to come out so there ’s some room for manoeuvre			2
but i do n’t think he will – he ’s very grounded			0
he still does the ironing ; he ’s better than me			0
’ there are no pangs about him working with @entity247 and @entity248			0
‘ it ’s not an issue , ’ she says			0
nor is there any envy at @entity19 ’s success			1
‘ i think he ’s such a good actor so it ’s very easy to say , fair play , you absolutely deserve to be where you are			0
it would seem really petty to think , oh well , he ’s done this , why have n’t i ? ’ however , mr @entity95 could provide her with the breakthrough from working actor to household name			1
she says : ‘ i ’m hoping my career will start to take off a bit more now			0
’ not that she wants fame – only recognition			0
for she , more than most , understands the nerve - racking nature of success on such a grand scale			0
‘ i do slightly worry , ’ she admits			0
@entity3 ’s a massive film but we ’ve been together for a long time and whatever life throws at us , we ’ll be able to get through it			0
’ she does n’t need to say the obvious – that if they got through that 18 months apart , they can get through anything .			1
