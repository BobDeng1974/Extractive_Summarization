by @entity0 last updated at 6:25 pm on 11th january 2012 a teenage ice hockey player has been left paralysed by a dangerous hit from behind during a game just days after a 16 - year - old was told he would never walk again following a similar incident			1
@entity7 senior @entity6 , from @entity8 , was hospitalised after she was ' checked ' from behind during a game on friday night			2
she fell to the ice and was unable to move			0
her injury comes only a week after @entity13 's player @entity12 , 16 , was left paralysed for life in an almost identical incident just miles away			1
passion : despite receiving a similar ice hockey injury before , it did not deter @entity6 , 18 , from returning to the game she loves danger : @entity6 was slammed into the boards from behind when an opposing player checked her			1
she fell to the ice and did n't move injury : ice hockey star @entity12 fractured two bones in his lower neck as well as severing his spinal chord and is unlikely to be able to walk ever again ironically , right before the game which left her in hospital , @entity6 , 18 , wrote on her @entity32 page that she would be playing in honour of @entity12 and had even chaged her profile picture to the number 13 - which was the teen 's player number - and the words ' @entity12 , always in our hearts '			1
before the game , she wrapped her stick in red tape as a tribute to the 16 - year - old			1
@entity6 is being treated at the @entity46 in @entity47 but doctors are confident she will make a full recovery as she has not broken her spinal chord , as in @entity12 's case - who was told he will likely never walk again as a result of the injury			1
though she still has no feelings in her legs , she has pain and tingling in her arms and upper body , which is a ' good sign ' , according to her parents			2
recovery : though she only has feeling in parts of her upper body and none in her lower , doctors are confident she will make a full recovery as her spinal chord has not been broken parents : @entity71 and @entity72 , of @entity73 , said they are remaining optimistic about her recovery as she has suffered a similar injury before and was given the ok to return to the ice @entity71 and @entity72 , of @entity73 , said they are remaining optimistic about her recovery as she has suffered a similar injury before and was given the ok to return to the ice , though it is still too early to say whether or not her injuries will be permanent			1
mr @entity82 told the @entity83 : ' she 's irritable and in a lot of pain , which is , in a way , kind of good			2
' @entity6 's mother is calling for a changes in the game , as did @entity12 's mother after her son 's devastating injury			1
she said : ' the system needs to be reformed			0
checking is getting so out of control			0
' a video of the game clearly shows the 18 - year - old being checked into the boards from behind and falling immediately to the ice			1
the two incidents have caused players , parents and coaches to call for an overhaul of the rules of checking in ice hockey - which is one of the most common defensive techniques			0
harsher penalties and and better warnings on the dangers of such aggressive hits are advised , as tensions among the @entity8 ice community have reached an all - time high following the reports of the two injuries			0
love : friends and family have been rallying around 18 - year - old @entity6 , right , as she recovers in hospital tribute : hours before the game , @entity6 changed her @entity32 profile picture to honour @entity12 , left , who was paralyzed after a december 30 game , and in a similar fashion , a @entity32 page has been set up for @entity6 , with her number and ' in our @entity128 ' also included , right hospital : doctors at first did not know how severe the injuries were but confirmed yesterday that he was paralyzed for life @entity134 , head coach at @entity13 , agrees that the sport faces questions and that checking from behind needs to be addressed			1
he told the @entity83 : ' i do n't know how you could n't have some hard questions after this			0
my take is , you ca n't legislate against tragedy			0
but what can you do to lessen the likelihood that a tragedy will occur ? ' that said , the permissive culture of checking from behind is an issue			0
why would that not be treated like fighting ? do we need rule changes ? no. we need a change in mentality			0
' @entity6 was playing for her team , the @entity155 , against the @entity156 on friday night			2
after firing a shot on goal , she was allegedly checked into the boards from behind by an opposing defender			0
fundraising : a joint @entity32 support page has been set up for the two injured teens according to @entity7 athletic director @entity164 , the high school senior almost immediately lost feeling throughout most of her body			2
' she 's had an mri , and it did not show breaks in the spinal cord , which makes it different than @entity12 's [ injury ] , ' mr @entity164 told the @entity83			1
' it 's an injury she 's had in the past			0
hopefully , it will improve			0
' last week , @entity12 's mother @entity177 alarmingly warned : ' we just want to make sure this does n't happen again			1
and if they keep playing the game the way it is , there 's going to be more attacks in situations like this			2
' mrs @entity187 went to visit @entity6 in hospital to offer her support and bring a get well card .			0

@entity6 changed her profile picture to @entity12 's number and name before the game
wrapped her stick in red tape in honour of the player
the 16 - year - old was told just last week he will never be able to walk again after severing spinal chord
some hope for @entity6 , 18 , as she has some feeling in upper body
