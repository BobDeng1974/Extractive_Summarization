@entity0 believes his former club @entity1 will reap the rewards for showing patience and sticking with beleaguered manager @entity4 , the man who sold @entity0 to @entity5 in the summer			1
@entity1 have shown little sign of shaking off what many perceived to be early season rustiness and a 2 - 1 home loss to @entity10 before the international break has left fans wondering if there is a deep - rooted problem behind their five defeats in 11 league games			2
but while @entity0 will look to inflict further misery upon his former club when they meet on sunday , he believes @entity4 will eventually propel @entity1 up the table once the team is familiar with his high - intensity pressing style of play			1
@entity0 played at @entity1 for almost ten years before moving to @entity5 in the summer @entity4 has seen @entity1 lose five of their opening eleven @entity25 matches @entity0 ( right ) has enjoyed life so far at @entity5 and believes they are building for the future ' they have to be patient , ' @entity0 told the @entity30			1
' it takes time when you bring in a manager and he brings different players in			0
he will have a different style of football			0
' there are high expectations at @entity1 and it comes with a lot of pressure			0
you have to be able to live that			0
' @entity0 , who made over 300 appearances in almost ten years at @entity46 , said he accepts @entity4 's decision to sell him in the summer , and has enjoyed his time at @entity5 so far			1
@entity0 believes @entity4 needs time to get his ideas across to the @entity1 squad @entity51 ( centre ) celebrates putting @entity10 ahead as they beat @entity1 2 - 1 at @entity46 ' it was made clear i would not play as much football as i would like under @entity4 , ' @entity0 explained			2
' when the chance came to come to @entity5 and i could see what they were building last year and with getting to the cup final , i was delighted			0

@entity0 left for @entity5 after almost ten years at @entity1
the *defender* *forgives* @entity63 for showing him the door
@entity0 feels @entity4 needs time to get @entity1 used to his style of play
