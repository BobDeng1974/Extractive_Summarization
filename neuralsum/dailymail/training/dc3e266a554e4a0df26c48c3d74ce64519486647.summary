' it 's been keeping us awake every night - sometimes we only get an hour 's sleep ' @entity27 , local resident ‘ there are several mobile phone transmitters nearby , which i think are responsible , because they 're due to start transmitting 4g signals soon			1
‘ also , they have recently installed new streetlights nearby , which could well be emitting these waves , which we 're hearing at home			0
‘ there 's only one more traditional yellow - light street lamp on our street and so that would explain why the monitor wo n't pick anything up at our home			2
