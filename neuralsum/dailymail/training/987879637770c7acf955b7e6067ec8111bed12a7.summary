@entity1 's animals have embraced the @entity3 spirit , enjoying a few pumpkin - shaped treats of their own this october 31			1
@entity6 squirrel monkeys , penguins , a tortoise and a tiger were just some of the animals who were involved in fun and games to celebrate the spooky day			1
the squirrel monkeys were treated to snacks such as sunflower seeds , monkey nuts and their favourite treat , wax worms , all served in carved pumpkins			2
@entity21 - toise ! a @entity23 tortoise chows down on a carved pumpkin as a treat for @entity3 at @entity1 a london zoo keeper said the squirrel monkeys have thoroughly enjoyed the unusual meal time arrangements and the monkey are especially curious			1
' the monkeys are so inquisitive , they 're going to absolutely adore these pumpkins and they 'll be head first in looking for what they can get , ' she said			2
' our monkeys are very much like us , so they 're like children , extremely inquisitive			1
they want to explore everything			2
they love insects and things like that so they 'll be foraging around under leaves			0
so anything new that we put in is really exciting for them			0
' a @entity1 employee said the squirrel monkeys are very inquisitive and love the filled pumpkins a squirrel monkey likes what he see as he makes his way down to the carved pumpkins the staff member said it encourages the whole group to come down and it also encourages all of the natural behaviour that is seen in the wild			2
' the more brave ones will be the first down and then some of the younger ones will be holding back so it 's fun to watch them all interact			0
' the penguins , who are located in a walk - through enclosure , also enjoy their own range of @entity3 inspired treats with fish attracting their interest in the pumpkins			1
the pumpkin treats elicit natural behaviours of the monkeys as they explore anything new it 's mine ! a tiger also plays with one of the pumpkins during the short video speaking to a little boy who asks the keeper if the penguins ever get scared the keeper says that they are entirely comfortable in their surroundings			1
' ' no , they 're not scared , ' she says			0
' they 've been brought up in this enclosure where it 's a walk through			0
