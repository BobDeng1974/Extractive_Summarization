the last time i found myself in such close proximity to a handsome continental chap , i was 16 , and my parents had packed me off to @entity5 for the summer to improve my @entity6			2
once there , of course , i immediately began a summer romance with the son of the local boulanger			2
while the garcon and i got into some merry old scrapes together , i certainly do n’t remember @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , or whatever his name was , hanging me upside down , twisting me into yoga positions and dangling me from his feet			1
today , 25 years later , it ’s a different story			2
i ’m trying out @entity21 ( ‘ @entity25 ’ means balance and ‘ yoga ’ is union ) , the hottest treatment currently sweeping @entity27			1
at first glance it all looks slightly bizarre and far too intimate for a happily married woman such as myself : a massage followed by a combination of acrobatics , meditation and yoga moves , this second part practised while balanced on top of @entity31 ’s hands and feet as he holds your weight			1
i have little truck with websites that insinuate the healing power of the foetal position ( it ’s curling into a ball , for goodness sake ) , and i am also suspicious of anything claiming to unite mind and body ( hard to separate them in the first place without removing your brain , surely ? )			1
also , @entity31 has little formal training			1
he went to art college , where he studied life drawing , and then became a graphic designer before devising this practice 14 years ago			1
the process begins with a massage before moving on to the acrobatics			1
@entity78 says the yoga is a completely unerotic experience but once i log on to his website , i start to get it			1
@entity31 is quite devastating looking : dark - haired , with a chiselled jaw and the body of an athlete			1
never have i studied a website so closely — for research purposes , you understand			2
from next month , we are informed , he is seeing clients in @entity93			2
will @entity95 women be queuing up for one - to - ones with the 43 - year - old , like their @entity6 and @entity98 counterparts ? i suspect they will			1
to the envy of — and not a little teasing from — my friends , i decide to book an appointment			2
but on the day we meet at his @entity93 clinic , i ’m not feeling open - minded about upside - down yoga as the panacea to all life ’s tensions			1
it ’s the middle of a hectic week , juggling a back - to - school timetable of extra-curricular activities for my three children and i ’m feeling fraught and decidedly grumpy			1
complaints that i have bought the ‘ wrong sort of sugar ’ for their morning porridge consolidates my irritation			2
so i ’m in a rotten mood and with very low expectations			2
i find it impossible to imagine i will ever be capable of curving gracefully in an airborne crab position ( as photos of his clients on @entity31 ’s website depict ) , no matter how good - looking the supporting act			1
thankfully , although @entity31 is actually even more handsome than his photos , he is extremely matter of fact and reassuring			1
‘ there is no point in having expectations about the treatment , ’ he says			0
‘ everybody reacts differently : some people laugh and some cry			0
’ i lie face down on sheets in a bright white room and @entity31 begins the hour - and - a half - long massage around my whole body			1
while he makes no medical claims , his belly massage is deeply relaxing and clients say it has helped with digestive , menstrual and fertility problems			2
as yet i am not feeling any union of mind and body , just a bit stressed and very exposed , lying on my front in my knickers , covered by a thin sheet			0
but there is nothing like an amazing massage			2
my eyes close and i start to feel relaxed			0
@entity31 has little formal training			1
he went to art college , where he studied life drawing , and then became a graphic designer before devising this practice 14 years ago occasionally , @entity31 ’s voice interrupts my stasis			1
‘ breathe deeply , ’ he says			0
‘ release the tension through your stomach and into the ground			0
’ when he starts to massage up my back , he says thoughtfully : ‘ there is a lot of tension here , ’ as he pushes into my right hip			2
‘ it as though there is intense irritation that ca n’t be expressed			0
’ to my astonishment my eyes well up with tears			0
i think back to that morning , when trying very hard not to shout at my children as they moaned about their breakfast , then feeling bereft when they were cross with me			0
‘ it ’s natural to feel emotional , ’ soothes @entity31 as i brush the tears away , mortified			1
a few minutes later he smiles			0
‘ i can feel the tension radiating away from your heart			0
’ @entity78 says the bizarre form of yoga has emotional as well as physical benefits , making her feel more relaxed this is the sort of comment that would normally have me snorting into my kale juice , but do you know what ? whether it ’s the release of the stress knots across my whole back or the fact that he ’s truly struck a nerve , i believe him			1
i feel lighter , as though a huge weight has been lifted from me			0
i can also assure anyone gaping over pictures of @entity31 , that it is a completely unerotic experience			1
truly , it ’s more like spending time with a really good friend			0
@entity78 says @entity21 is life - changing when we get to the upside ‑ down acrobatics , i am gently swayed up into the air where i am rocked gently to and fro			1
i feel no fear , just a strange floating , flying feeling			0
beneath me are the firm and capable hands of @entity31 , moving my body into the unfeasible - looking stretches i saw on his website			1
although i am upside down , his legs are restricting ( not uncomfortably ) the blood flow in my legs , so that it does n’t rush to my head			0
at no point do i get that dizzy feeling you usually have when you hang , head down			0
the floating feeling is because my entire weight is being taken by @entity31 ( ‘ i do have a weight limit , ’ he says			1
‘ more than 80kg is a bit much			0
’ ) i feel very safe , and in contrast to my earlier tears , i ca n’t stop grinning — partly at the release of a great deal of pent - up tension			2
my body arches and twists so that my back feels wonderfully stretched out			0
@entity31 ’s hands push on release points down my back and shoulders as i relax			1
he explains that the stretches in @entity250 elongate and realign the spine			0
finally i am lowered into the foetal position , which signifies the end of our session			0
here , you are held in a firm hug and by this point my cynicism has vanished			0
it feels incredibly protective and comforting , like being held by an old friend			0
after leaving , i sleep a full night without waking , and in the morning i still feel happy and light			0
i do n’t shout at the children , even when i find myself locked in the @entity264			0
a week on , and i am still relaxed and calm			0
it may sound extraordinary and mad , but @entity21 is life - changing stuff			1
i even try telling the children that we ought to hug each other more , but they flinch slightly and i realise i ’m pushing it .			0
