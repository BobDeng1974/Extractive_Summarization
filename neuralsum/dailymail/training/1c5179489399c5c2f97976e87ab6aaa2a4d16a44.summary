by @entity0 published : 03:49 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 05:51 est , 14 may 2013 motorway service stations may be forced to advertise the prices their rivals charge for fuel , under @entity5 plans to clamp down on ‘ rip - off ’ charges			1
@entity8 has ordered a review of motorway fuel prices after an @entity12 report this year found they were significantly higher than at normal petrol stations			1
the study in january found that petrol prices on the motorway are 7.5p per litre higher than on the average forecourt			1
diesel prices are an average 8.3p per litre higher			1
petrol stations on motorways could be forced to advertise the fuel prices of near rivals in a bid to stop drivers being ripped off the @entity12 found it cost £ 72.20 to fill a car with petrol from a motorway services station , compared to £ 66.70 from a supermarket ministers are interested in learning lessons from @entity32 , which forces service stations to advertise their rivals ’ prices to boost competition			1
government sources said mr @entity8 had asked the @entity39 policy unit to investigate options for bringing prices down			1
‘ the prime minister has asked the policy unit to prioritise cost of living issues , ’ a source said			0
‘ this is one area where we believe transparency can drive down prices and give motorists a better deal			2
‘ the problem on the motorway is that the fuel prices are only advertised on the forecourt			2
‘ that is the legal requirement			0
but by the time you ’ve pulled off the motorway and stopped , it is often more trouble than it ’s worth to go on to the next service station , particularly as you ’ve got no idea whether it will be any cheaper			0
’ the policy review has been ordered by @entity8 , who is on a three - day visit to the @entity65 where he yesterday held talks with president @entity67 the @entity12 report found that higher costs could only partially explain the inflated fuel prices found on motorways , where drivers are often unable to look for a better deal			1
the study suggested that the lack of transparency about prices on the motorway was a potentially significant factor in the higher charges			1
the @entity39 policy unit has now drawn up a series of options for reform			0
as a minimum , service stations are likely to be required to advertise their fuel prices at the roadside , so that drivers can make a decision before they pull off			0
the @entity91 has also been asked to investigate whether @entity93 signs could be used to display information about fuel prices on the motorway			2
and officials will consider whether to copy the @entity32 model that requires service station operators to advertise the prices of their rivals			0
under this option , operators could be forced to display not only their own prices , but also those of the next two service stations on the motorway			2
the @entity12 said sharp rises in fuel prices was cause by increases in tax and not price - fixing by oil companies pre-tax petrol prices in the @entity116 are amongst the lowest in @entity117 , the @entity12 said the prices would be shown on the motorway , giving drivers the option of continuing to the next service station if it is offering a better deal			1
a formal consultation on the issue is likely to be issued by the @entity91 later this year			0
although the reforms will not force operators to cut their charges , ministers believe the increased transparency should drive down prices			2
the review is part of a wider drive within @entity5 to tackle the soaring cost of living , which ministers fear will be a major issue at the next election			0
mr @entity8 is also under pressure from his own mps , who have identified fuel prices as the single biggest cost of living concern			1
the @entity143 last night welcomed the initiative and called for it to be expanded to include service station food			0
@entity143 spokesman @entity146 said motorway drivers had ‘ long been victims of some pretty indefensible pricing ’			0
he added : ‘ this is welcome news for motorists and commercial drivers alike but we still need motorway services to be transparent and fair on all their prices			2
they have held the motorist to ransom for far too long			0

@entity8 orders clamp down on rip off charges on motorways
@entity12 found motorway prices 7.5p per lite higher than average forecourts
