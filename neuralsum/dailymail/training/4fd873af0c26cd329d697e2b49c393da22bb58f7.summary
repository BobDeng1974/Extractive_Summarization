one night the power went out			0
huddling together in the dark with the 15 other prisoners sharing her 12ft by 12ft cell , they told her that means either a breakout is happening , or a contract killing is being carried out			0
in an ironic twist @entity6 used to point out the prison on her tours while working for @entity101 , telling holidaymakers to avoid renting a car because the police would arrest you for merely witnessing an accident			2

' @entity140 ' - how an argument over a t - shirt meant whirlwind romance ended in tragedy when @entity6 first visited the stunning @entity11 isle of the @entity5 in 2000 she fell instantly in love with the country 's white sands , palm trees and glorious sunshine			1
she loved it so much that just three years later she moved there along with her two children , @entity112 and @entity113 , and her parents @entity115 and @entity13			2
@entity76 used to visit the family to help them out with their garden and pool			2
after a whirlwind romance @entity6 married him in 2007 and the couple made a home for themselves in @entity163			2
paradise : 150,000 @entity131 holiday on the tropical isle , famous for its white sand and palm trees , every year but one night last july that was all due to change as the couple argued over money while out with friends			1
struggling to get by , @entity6 became angry with @entity76 when she spotted him wearing a t - shirt she did n't recognise with ' live life to the best ' written on the front			1
she accused him of spending money on extras that they could n't afford and a ' minor argument ' happened			0
afterwards the couple drove home , @entity6 in her jeep and @entity76 riding beside her on his motorbike without wearing a helmet , the norm in the @entity5			1
after swerving to avoid a group of people @entity6 says she heard a ' horrible bang ' and jumped out to search of @entity76 in the dark			1
