by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 05:07 est , 25 june 2013 a rugby - loving teenager , who came within just one centimetre of being paralysed , has amazed doctors by returning to the pitch less than a year after breaking her back			1
@entity5 , 14 , slipped and fell down the stairs at her home in @entity8 , @entity9 , in august last year and for months required round - the - clock care			1
she had been playing on her mobile phone at the time when she accidentally missed a step			1
earlier this month a study found that mobile phone - related injuries had doubled in just five years and that the number was set to double again by 2015			1
@entity5 , 14 , slipped and fell down the stairs at her home in @entity8 last august			1
she broke her back in two places and also broke her foot			1
doctors feared she could be paralysed @entity5 was required to wear a spinal brace for almost three months to re-align her spine , which meant she could not move her torso , and she relied on her parents to help her wash and get around			1
her father , @entity28 , said : ‘ @entity5 totally missed the top step of the stairs as she was playing on her phone and the next thing we knew she was lying in a heap at the bottom of the stairs			1
‘ she had fractured her spine in two places and doctors said she may never walk again			2
‘ if one of the fractures had been one centimetre higher , she would have been paralysed for life			0
’ @entity5 , a @entity43 fan , gave up ballet to play rugby two years ago , and managed to secure a place in the @entity48 team just before her accident			2
in the tumble , she also broke a bone in her foot , meaning she struggled to get around			0
mr @entity28 , a 45 - year - old joiner , said : ‘ she had to wear the brace all the time except for when she was in bed and then she had to lie flat on her back			1
@entity5 was treated at @entity56 where doctors told her that had one of the breaks in her back been a centimetre higher she would have been paralysed			1
she had to wear a back brace for three months ‘ we had to get up every half an hour during the night to make sure she was lying flat			1
‘ as soon as she got up she had to put in on so that her spine could realign properly			0
‘ she could n’t wear it in the shower because it would have rusted so we had to hold her up and help her wash so that she did n’t flop and bend her spine			0
’ @entity5 ’s family , including her mum @entity70 , and siblings @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , were left to find out whether she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and nervously stayed at her bedside in @entity56			0
they desperately tried to keep her spirits up by decorating her bed with @entity43 flags , and she was even sent a signed picture of her favourite player , @entity84			0
@entity5 ( centre ) told her parents , @entity87 ( back left ) and @entity70 ( front right ) that if she was paralysed she would take up wheelchair rugby			1
she is also pictured with her sister , @entity73 ( front left ) and brother , @entity74 ( back right ) mrs @entity5 , 45 , said : ‘ when it happened she was just screaming and shouting so we knew it was bad			2
‘ the whole time she was in hospital was hell because one minute they were saying she was going to be ok and the next , they were saying things did n’t look good			0
‘ but @entity5 was so upbeat , it was unbelievable			0
even when she thought she was going to be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life , she told us she was going to take up wheelchair rugby ! ’ amazingly after an agonising recovery , @entity5 has returned to the sport			0
mr @entity28 said : ‘ when the doctors gave her the all - clear to start back we were very worried but she wanted to do it			2
@entity5 says that she was really scared before her return to the rugby pitch because she feared she would injure herself again during a tackle ‘ we said we would let her go back and as the ruby union season had finished she gave rugby league a go			2
‘ it was very nerve - wracking when she first went out on to the pitch , but she loves it and it ’s great to see her having such a good time			0
‘ she sends out a great message to other girls her age - it ’s not just for boys , it ’s good fun , it keeps you fit and it keeps kids off the streets			0
’ @entity5 , who hopes to play for @entity136 one day , said : ‘ i was really nervous before my first game back			2
it was the tackling - i could n’t just stand there and do nothing but i was a bit scared of hurting myself again			0
‘ i feel so lucky because it could have gone so differently if that break had been higher			0
the doctors said one centimetre higher and i would have been paralysed			2
