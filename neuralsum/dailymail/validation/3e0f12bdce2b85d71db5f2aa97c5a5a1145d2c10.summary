teenagers as young as 16 in @entity1 have undergone weight loss surgery obese teenagers as young as 16 have had @entity6 - funded gastric band operations , worrying new figures show			1
and in a four - year period , the number of people aged under 30 receiving weight loss surgery in @entity1 more than doubled			1
gastric band and gastric bypass operations are only carried out on the @entity6 when a patient 's life is deemed to be at risk			1
such surgery is a last resort , and before it is considered a patient is asked to make drastic changes to their lifestyle to try and lose weight naturally			1
the guidelines are such that a 5ft 5ins child will not be considered eligible for the drastic procedure unless they weigh at least 15 stone			0
meanwhile someone who is 5ft 8ins would need to weigh almost 17 stone before they can be given the go - ahead for surgery			2
figures from the @entity32 released under the @entity33 show in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery			1
these included two 16 year olds , two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds			2
overall between 2008 - 09 and 2011 - 12 the numbers of the radical operations performed on the under 30s rose from 35 to 71 - a 102 per cent increase			1
it comes as new figures this weekend revealed hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year			2
since 2011 , 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese - weighing 9lb 15oz or more , a @entity33 request revealed			2
last year it emerged that @entity49 are the second fattest group in the whole country , with @entity52 figures revealing 65.7 per cent of people are overweight or obese			2
new figures released in january this year highlighted the worrying news that almost four out of 10 children in @entity1 are officially classed as overweight or obese by the age of 11			1
concerns have been raised that people are opting for stomach surgery as an ' easy option ' rather than go to the trouble of changing their lifestyle , eating more healthily and taking exercise			0
@entity6 guidelines state that surgery can only be offered when the patient has ' life threatening obesity ' - a body mass index ( @entity71 ) of 40 or above , or a @entity71 of 35 with other serious health conditions that could be improved through weight loss , such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure			1
the policy states : ' it is always recommended that patients try to lose weight through a healthy , calorie - controlled diet and increased exercise before you consider weight loss surgery , as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards			1
' due to these associated risks , most surgeons , whether they are working privately or for the @entity6 , would only consider a person for surgery if there was a clinical need , and not just for cosmetic reasons			0
' people can also opt to pay for weight loss surgery privately			1
a gastric band operation , which reduces the size of the stomach , costs up to £ 8,000			0
meanwhile , a full gastric bypass , which re-routes the digestive system meaning a person can digest much less food , costs around £ 15,000			2
in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery			1
which includes gastric bands abd bypasses			1
these included two 16 year olds , two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds the @entity6 has warned that the treatment is available more cheaply overseas , but added it carries increased risks			2
current statistics suggest that there is a one in 1,000 risk of death from weight loss surgery within 30 days			1
nationally 16 teenagers under the age of 17 underwent stomach surgery in the last five years			2
responding to figures revealing a rise in obese newborns , @entity126 , of the @entity127 , said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions , which increase the size of the baby , most just overeat			2
he said : ' quite simply , the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing			0
' it is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight			0
' as they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is a continuous upwards spiral			0
' successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem			0
it starts at conception and sometimes even before then			0
' mr @entity126 also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies			0
he said : ' some babies are so fat they can not come out naturally			0
' women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation			0
' if we get it wrong , it 's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on			0
' @entity161 has contacted @entity162 and @entity163 for comment			0
a 12 - year - old boy has become the youngest person in @entity167 to have a gastric band fitted , as doctors struggle to fight the child obesity epidemic			1
the schoolboy is one of an increasing number of youngsters who have had the controversial weight - loss operations , despite recommendations that such high - risk surgery should be a last resort when other efforts to slim down have failed			1
figures seen by @entity181 show that 62 young people aged 18 or under had the stomach - shrinking surgery at @entity6 and private hospitals over a three - year period			1
they include the 12 - year - old , one boy aged 13 and two boys aged 15			1
professor @entity190 , head of paediatric dentistry at @entity192 , who regularly operates on obese children to remove decayed teeth , said it was ‘ a matter of national shame that we have these health problems when we are a wealthy , developed nation			0
the treatments i carry out all cost taxpayers money			0
‘ [ yet ] as a professional in my field i have to approach parents with great caution			0
i ca n’t accuse parents of anything			0
but of course the parent is responsible for the child ’s welfare and health			0
’ a 12 - year - old boy has become the youngest person in @entity167 to have a gastric band fitted as figures show 62 young people aged 18 or under had the stomach - shrinking surgery at @entity6 and private hospitals over a three - year period he added that social workers would be quick to step in at any sign of a parent abusing a child , ‘ yet you can have a child with up to 20 decayed teeth in their mouth , a big fat face , seriously ill and having to be admitted to hospital for a serious operation under general anaesthetic without consequence for the parent			1
’ official statistics from the @entity237 , which is compiled from surgeons ’ reports , reveal that the 12 - year - old boy is the youngest child to have been fitted with a gastric band within this group , although it is not recorded if the operation was publicly or privately funded			1
@entity6 statisticians said the youngest patient they had on record for bariatric surgery paid for by the @entity247 was 13			1
however , many surgeons argue that the stomach bands could save the @entity6 money through reducing levels of obesity and associated illnesses such as type 2 diabetes , which are estimated to cost the @entity247 £ 5 billion a year			2
dr @entity255 , a clinical psychologist at @entity256 , said parents whose children are facing gastric band surgery can fail to take responsibility for their child ’s weight issues			1
she said : ‘ parents can be in denial of the part they have played			0
‘ but children need to be brought up to eat in such a way that they ’re nurturing their body rather than slowly damaging it			0
’ paediatric consultant @entity269 added : ‘ some parents , when they come to us , have the idea that if their child has the surgery it will act like a magic wand			0
