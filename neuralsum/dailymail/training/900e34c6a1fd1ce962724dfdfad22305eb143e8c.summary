an ancient @entity1 wine cup may be one of the earliest depictions of constellations in the night sky			1
that 's according to a researcher who says the markings of animals on the cup actually correspond to patterns of stars			2
and he says that other ancient hunting scenes depicted in drawings might also be drawings of constellations			1
@entity18 from the @entity19 says this ancient @entity1 cup depicts constellations			1
from left to right are seen here a bull ( @entity23 ) , snake ( @entity25 ) , rabbit or small dog ( @entity28 ) and a larger dog ( @entity30 or @entity31 )			2
if confirmed it would be one of the earliest records of @entity1 astronomy the two - handled cup known as a skyphos is about 2,600 years old and is on display at the @entity39 in @entity40			1
it was studied by @entity18 , a classical archaeology doctoral candidate at the @entity19			2
he says this particular artefact dates back to about 600 to 625 bc. it was originally found in a pit in the 7th century acropolis of @entity47 , 25 miles ( 40km ) north of @entity48 , @entity40			1
bull : @entity23 ( autumn ) snake : @entity25 ( winter ) rabbit : @entity28 ( winter ) dog : @entity30 or @entity31 ( spring ) scorpion : @entity54 ( spring ) @entity55 : @entity56 ( summer ) @entity57 : @entity58 ( summer ) * note : there may be other missing constellations that also represent summer but until now no one had considered the animals drawn on the cup could be constellations			1
on the cup in the image can be seen a bull , a hare or small dog and a large dog			0
on the other side is a scorpion , dolphin and the front half of a panther or a lion			0
the cup has been partially damaged though , which suggests some animals depicting constellation may still be missing			0
' my dad raised me on astronomy , and to me , the snake , rabbit and dog together looked like constellations , ' mr @entity18 told @entity88			1
' that group jumped out at me			0
' while such drawings of hunting scenes are common in ancient @entity40 , mr @entity18 says this depiction including a dolphin with a land animal is odd			1
this led him to believe the drawings were showing constellations			0
according to @entity88 , most of what we know about @entity1 astronomy comes from various literary texts , but they only go back to the 5th century			1
this , therefore , would be one of the earliest records of @entity1 astronomy			2
in addition , mr @entity18 told @entity107 the crosses on the cup represent stars , ' which ties in quite nicely with my idea			2
' the two - handled cup known as a skyphos is about 2,600 years old and is on display at the @entity39 in @entity40			1
it was originally found in a pit in the 7th century acropolis of @entity47 , 25 miles ( 40km ) north of @entity48 , @entity40 ( shown in map ) mr @entity18 says the findings may mean that other drawings of hunting scenes may actually be sketches of constellations			1
he also says the crosses on the cup are stars			0
from left to right here is a scorpion ( @entity54 ) , dolphin ( @entity56 ) and part of a lion ( @entity58 ) while such drawings of hunting scenes are common in @entity40 , mr @entity18 says this depiction including a dolphin with a land animal is @entity139 led him to believe the drawings were showing constellations , some of which are shown in this image he says that aside from this and one other fragment from a similar time , ' the earliest depictions of constellations that can be reliably traced is not until 100 or 200 years after this			1
' the significance apart from its age means that there might be more to be found			0
' animals and figures might have been overlooked and viewed as hunting scenes or random assortments of animals , ' he says			2
animals are commonly attributed to certain seasons			0
here @entity30 is depicted by a dog on the left , and on the right the constellation @entity28 is depicted by a rabbit ' if my proposal is correct , not just constellations but seasonal groupings , then that might suggest that they did in fact demarcate [ set the boundaries ] of the seasons of the year by associations with cosntellations			0
' that 's something we know they did later and had pretty good reason to suspect they also did in this more archaic period , but we had n't been able to show it yet			0
' most of the constellations are also not arranged in the order they appear in the sky			0
this suggests they may have been arranged for another purpose - possibly to define the seasons to show time throughout the year , as opposed to a calendar			0
the constellations in this case are separated into the four seasons in line with when they appear in the night sky			0
mr @entity18 ' findings were detailed in the journal @entity199 .			2

@entity18 of the @entity19 has *sensationally* *claimed* that drawings of what were thought to be hunting scenes may be constellations
his findings are based on the *analysis* of an ancient @entity1 *vessel*
the two - handled cup called a skyphos was found north of @entity48 , @entity40
it is thought to date back to around 625 bc
on the side it has drawings of animals that correspond to constellations
these include a bull ( @entity23 ) , a lion ( @entity58 ) and a dolphin ( @entity56 )
mr @entity18 says it is *unusual* for these animals to be drawn together
and he says instead they seem to be grouped into seasons
this suggests the cup is one of the earliest *replicas* of @entity1 astronomy
