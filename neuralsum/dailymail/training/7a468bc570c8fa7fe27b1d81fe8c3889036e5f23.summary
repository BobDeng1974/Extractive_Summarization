by @entity1 reporter published : 09:50 est , 1 july 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 1 july 2013 booze : underage drinkers are using supermarket online delivery services to get alcohol sent to their homes children are getting around laws banning underage drinkers by buying alcohol from supermarket online delivery services			2
nearly half of underage buyers do not get asked for proof of age on the doorstep at the time of delivery , a report has revealed			1
a survey of @entity22 teenagers aged 14 to 17 found many find it ' easy ' to get alcohol delivered to their homes			1
the alcohol awareness charity @entity25 found 15 per cent had bought alcohol online			1
while two thirds said they used online shopping to buy alcohol as it was the easiest way to ' bypass id checks '			0
all teenagers had to do was agree to the website terms and conditions and use a debit card and email address - and then wait for the alcohol to be dropped off			1
the survey was carried out in tandem with a police sting operation in which 15 - year - olds used supermarket websites to get beer , wine and vodka delivered to their door			1
in 44 per cent of the test purchases , alcohol was delivered to the underage buyers who answered the door without any requests for proof of age			1
the @entity51 operation involved five different supermarkets , tested on two dates in march			0
deliver drivers failed to ask the 15 - year - old purchasers for proof of age in four out of the nine tests , with one supermarket failing twice			1
@entity51 did not disclose which supermarkets had failed the test but all have policies which state they will not deliver to people under 18			2
sergeant @entity65 , who led the sting operations , said he was ' disappointed ' with the failure rate of supermarket home delivery services and would ' work with the supermarkets ' to ensure under - 18s can not access alcohol in this way			1
alcohol concern is calling for supermarkets and other online retailers to review their existing age checking procedures to determine whether they are fit for purpose , following it 's on your doorstep report			2
the charity said delivery staff needed robust training in requesting and identifying proof of age			2
@entity87 , policy and research officer at @entity90 in @entity91 , said : ' retailers offering home delivery services need to toughen up			1
' their processes need to ensure that children and young people are prevented from accessing alcohol through this channel			0
' buying alcohol online via supermarket websites is unique in that the sale is made in private and with relative anonymity			0
' young people have told us that these sites offer less robust age verification practices and provide a quick and easy way to get hold of alcohol , especially for younger teenagers			1
' alcohol is a potentially addictive and harmful substance , especially for the young , and should be sold and distributed as such			0
' but the @entity110 , which represents most of the major supermarkets , said stores took their obligations not to sell to underage buyers ' seriously '			0
' easy ' : two thirds of the teenagers surveyed said they ordered online as it was a way to bypass @entity119 checks ( file photo ) a spokesman said : ' there are robust systems in place for age - restricted products purchased online , and delivery drivers are trained to ask for @entity119 if they have good reason to believe that age is an issue			1
' however , issues occasionally arise as banks are unwilling to identify people under 18 on credit or debit cards , which would be the easiest way of restricting purchases online			0
' parents also have some responsibility for the way in which their own cards are used by their children			0
' any specific evidence of wrongful selling – as opposed to anonymous claims in a survey – can be presented to the retailers concerned who will be most willing to investigate specific examples and ensure their systems are followed			0
' a @entity150 spokesman said : ' we all need to help tackle underage drinking - the police , the public , parents , and the shops and off - licences who sell alcohol			2
' the government will not tolerate under - age selling			0
it is the responsibility of retailers to ensure those being sold alcohol online are old enough			0
' the law has been toughened so those who persistently sell alcohol to children now face a £ 20,000 fine			0

police test finds 44 per cent of delivery drivers do *n't* check @entity119 of 15 - year - olds
