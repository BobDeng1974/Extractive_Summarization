@entity1 ’s four - year reign as @entity3 manager is over			2
the @entity4 has opted to cut his ties with the @entity7 club with a brief statement on thursday afternoon			1
he said : ' i have parted company with @entity3			2
the club are in a very strong position and i wish the fans and the club all the very best for the future			2
' ' i have supported @entity3 all my life and the @entity28 will always be part of me			2
it was an absolute honour to play for this great club , to captain the team and of course to become @entity3 manager , a position which i cherished dearly			2
however , i feel the time is now right to move on to a new challenge			0
' of course , i am very pleased that i will be leaving @entity3 as @entity40 champions and with the @entity28 in such good health			0
i wish the @entity28 nothing but good fortune going forward			0
' i would like to send my sincere thanks and best wishes to @entity46 and @entity47 who have supported me magnificently , to all the players and staff at the club who i have worked with over so many years and , of course , to our magnificent supporters who have been with me through everything			1
i would also like to thank @entity55 , @entity22 and the @entity28 ’s board of directors for their support			0
' @entity58 : @entity1 thanked all of his @entity3 players as well as the ' magnificent ' supporters ' i also want to thank my family for all they have given me			0
i could not have been @entity3 manager for four years without their wonderful support			1
' serving the club was always a privilege			0
i have always given my best and aimed to do all i can to ensure success for @entity3 , as a supporter it was all i wanted			0
' i will now assist the @entity28 in appointing my successor			0
as ever , we will need our fans ’ support and i am sure they will give the @entity28 and the new manager the same great backing which they gave to myself			0
' and the man the @entity40 champions want to replace him is former @entity7 defender @entity80			1
@entity1 ’s stint in charge is now history with only the formalities left to be tied up			0
since taking control in 2010 the @entity4 has won three @entity87 titles , two @entity40 cups and taken the club to the last 16 of the @entity90 after toppling @entity91			1
returning hero ? @entity93 has been installed as favourite to become new boss keen to test himself in @entity99 football , however , his resignation offers the 42 - year - old the freedom to speak to other clubs without seeking permission from @entity7 powerbrokers			1
speculation has surrounded the future of the former club captain for some time			0
concerned @entity3 plan to sell the key duo @entity110 and @entity111 this summer , the issue came to a head amidst concerns that qualification for the @entity90 is becoming more and more difficult			0
aside from facing three qualifiers to make the group stages , @entity3 will have to play those games at @entity118 due to @entity7 being used for the @entity119 – putting them at a distinct disadvantage			1
the recent departure of trusted deputy @entity46 has also persuaded @entity1 that this is the right time to move on			1
@entity1 has been heavily linked with a move to managerless @entity125 , but has been hamstrung by the need for the @entity128 club to seek permission to speak to him			1
that path has now been cleared			0
on wednesday night bookmakers @entity131 suddenly slashed the odds on @entity93 – currently in charge of @entity135 club @entity134 - becoming the new manager			1
former @entity3 defender and @entity138 boss @entity80 met @entity128 directors last thursday and is favourite for the job			1
@entity80 , however , also tops @entity3 ’s list for a potential replacement for @entity1			1
@entity144 has learned that a @entity3 representative has already made informal contact with a member of the @entity80 camp to establish if he would consider a return to his native @entity150			1
@entity80 holds the club in huge regard and has ambitions to manage at @entity7 one day – but has ambitions to return to management in the @entity156 sooner rather than later			1
@entity157 , recently sacked by @entity158 , is free to consider a return to his first love but that option seems unlikely			1
meet the new boss ? @entity163 and former team - mate @entity1 discuss the good old days last month @entity165 , the former @entity166 manager , is also in the mix together with ex @entity169 deputy @entity168			1
@entity163 , the @entity170 manager , would be a popular choice with supporters although the acrimonious nature of his departure in 2005 might count against him			1
in the running : @entity80 has been touted for a @entity3 return too whoever is appointed the next @entity3 manager has a tough act to follow			1
@entity1 served @entity3 as a player between 2000 and 2007 before returning as first team coach the following season			1
he was demoted to reserve team manager after @entity184 made way for @entity186 but was asked to take charge of the team after the latter was shown the door after an inglorious spell in charge			0
after being given the job on a permanent basis in 2010 , @entity1 built his own side by snapping up the likes of @entity197 , @entity111 and @entity198			1
his side narrowly missed out to @entity200 in the 2010 - 11 @entity201 yet defeated @entity202 to win the @entity203 that season			0
the following season , @entity1 , boosted by the acquisition of @entity207 , finally got his hands on the title and the following term his men took the scalp of @entity91 as they qualified for the last 16 of the @entity90			0
successive league titles were added last year and this – together with another @entity203 in 2013 and another @entity90 qualification last year			1
but facing the likelihood of losing @entity111 and @entity216 this summer , @entity1 has now opted to hand the task of rebuilding the squad to someone else			0
glory days : @entity1 lifts the @entity203 in 2005 next to @entity163 former @entity3 winger @entity221 has warned whoever succeeds @entity1 as manager will have to win two trophies a year if he wants to be considered a success			1
the @entity226 international , who played both with and under @entity1 during his time at @entity7 , knows the new incumbent faces a tough task			1
asked how much of a blow the @entity234 's departure was to the club , the @entity232 winger said : ' it 's a big blow			2
now @entity3 will obviously be looking to replace him with someone , but the big question is who do you replace him with ? ' that 's the first question , which candidates are out there ? you start looking straight away			0
' it will be a difficult job because @entity3 is a massive club and success is a way of life , you have to go and win every game , you have to go and win every trophy you compete in , apart from the @entity90			2
' if you are not winning two trophies a year , you are seen as a failure			0
' warning : @entity232 wideman @entity221 believes the next @entity3 manager will need to win two trophies a season to be considered a success @entity221 , however , admitted the news did not exactly come as a shock , even if the timing of it may have done			0
the 28 - year - old said : ' to be honest , it 's not really come as a surprise because of some things i 've heard from a few people , that he was a bit unsettled and had probably kind of done all he thought he could do with the club and maybe was looking for a new challenge down in @entity99 somewhere			0
' maybe the @entity3 fans would n't be shocked by it either , but obviously to just hear 10 minutes ago that he had resigned was a little bit of a shock in that sense			0
' ever since he took over at @entity3 from when i was there , he was brilliant			0
i played with him - he was difficult at times to get on with as a player , but as a manager , i ca n't speak highly enough of him			2
' he was fantastic when i was there and led the club to many trophies in the last four years			2
' maybe he just thinks it 's time for himself to get down to @entity99 somewhere and have a new challenge			0
' one of the @entity285 : @entity286 celebrates with @entity1 ( left ) and @entity221 ( right ) in 2006 meanwhile , another former @entity3 winger , @entity287 , says the absence of @entity200 from the @entity40 league cost @entity1 the chance of a top job in @entity99			1
@entity1 has left without another job to go to and @entity287 says that ’s an indication of how far @entity40 football has fallen in the esteem of @entity99 chairmen			2
' it ’s fair to say the @entity3 job no longer has the prestige it once had , ' observes @entity287			2
' at the time @entity300 and @entity301 were going head to head and @entity200 had players like @entity306 do @entity307 and @entity93 and @entity308			1
' the job does not have the cache it had then			2
i think @entity1 may feel that he has achieved all he possibly can in @entity40 and has now hit the glass ceiling			0
it ’ s time to move on			0

departure will spark interest from the @entity156 and @entity317
@entity4 won three league titles at @entity7 in four years
@entity80 , @entity93 and @entity163 are all in the running
former player @entity157 has also been linked with the job
