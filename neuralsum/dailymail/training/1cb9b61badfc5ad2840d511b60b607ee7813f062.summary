the old managerial head versus the emerging force , the established team of winners versus the homegrown heroes			2
the @entity5 has many intriguing sub-plots and @entity8 's @entity7 caught up with three legends of both clubs — @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 — to discuss how it might pan out			1
@entity15 and @entity16 are set to face off in the @entity5 final on sunday @entity18 : @entity15 v @entity16 — a game close to all your hearts			1
how do you assess where they both stand ? hazard : what a great cup final			2
@entity15 are the finished article and they have probably the best manager in the world whereas @entity16 are a work in progress with a young , up - and - coming manager			1
@entity11 : on paper it ’s @entity15 ’s to win but @entity16 learnt on @entity34 that they can beat @entity15			1
that will be a big factor in this — spurs do n’t have that doubt that they will have had before			2
@entity12 : spurs beating them 5 - 3 at the @entity41 will definitely give them a lot of confidence			1
you need belief going into a final			2
on the negative side , @entity16 playing on thursday is very difficult for the manager			1
another big question is the goalkeeper and i would definitely play the no 1 ( @entity53 over @entity54 )			2
@entity56 ’s first trophy with @entity15 was the @entity5 in 2005 and this game can get @entity16 back on the trophy trail			1
@entity54 has been @entity16 's @entity5 goalkeeper this season but could be dropped @entity60 : what do you make of the homegrown contingent coming through at @entity16 ? it ’s probably the one area where @entity16 have done noticeably better			1
hazard : in three or four years we could be talking about a very special group			2
i actually brought @entity69 to the club as an eight - year - old and @entity72 has taken the league by storm			2
he was unbelievable against @entity15 in the 5 - 3			1
but look at the players @entity15 have brought in — @entity76			1
then you have @entity79 , @entity80			2
it ’s hard to see how they get beaten on paper			2
@entity11 : hazard is only just behind @entity85 and @entity86 and has time ahead of him			1
on song he will win any game by himself			2
@entity79 , when he is on form , is a real handful			2
but saying that , i do n’t think ( @entity94 ) @entity93 has ever lost against him			2
@entity13 played for @entity15 from 1985 - 90 after playing for @entity16 for seven seasons @entity60 : @entity72 for @entity96 ? @entity12 : he has improved so quickly this season but we ’d be stupid to think that improvement curve is going to keep rising at the same speed			1
but if he keeps at the level he is now that is magnificent			2
if he can maintain the consistency , playing different roles , he ’ll go into the @entity96 squad			2
he ’s not in front of the likes of @entity108 at the moment but if he continues to flourish and score more goals , he ’ll force his way in			0
@entity72 is set to lead the line for @entity16 against @entity15 at @entity113 on sunday @entity60 : @entity72 ’s had an impact , but so has @entity56			1
people are perhaps getting tired of some of his talking , especially with recent incidents			0
is it a distraction to the team ? @entity12 : i do n’t think it ’s a good thing			1
i can see he ’s trying to put his point across but for me that has to be done behind the scenes , directly to the powers that be			0
i feel it ’s a distraction			0
their form has n’t been great while this has all been happening , put it that way			0
@entity11 : he does talk a lot			1
but i think he is 100 per cent good for the @entity134			0
when he left last time i think the division lost a little bit of its soul			0
but aside from that charisma , he is probably the best manager in the world			0
but we all love a character			0
i worked with @entity143 at @entity144			0
i used to make sure i was on his side in training			0
@entity12 believes that @entity56 's actions surrounding recent incidents have n't been a good thing @entity60 : you ’ve all played a few @entity16 - @entity15 fixtures — which ones stand out ? hazard : i remember one for @entity16 in the ( 1982 ) @entity156 quarter - final when we played @entity15 at @entity158			1
at quarter - to - three we were stuck in traffic on @entity160 so we were getting our gear out of the boot , dressing on the bus and then when we arrived we sprinted straight to the pitch			0
we were 1 - 0 down at half - time but came out second half and played football made in heaven			2
@entity12 and i both scored and we won 3 - 2			1
@entity16 ' @entity13 goes past @entity170 's @entity169 during a @entity172 match in 1980 @entity12 : i remember being @entity15 player - manager at @entity158 and being 1 - 0 down to @entity16			1
@entity15 had beaten @entity16 so many times and had n’t been beaten by @entity16 for years			1
i ’m thinking , ‘ oh my word , i can not be the first manager for so many years to lose to @entity16 ’			1
i was on the bench and i start warming up in front of the @entity16 fans , who start singing : ‘ you ’re @entity16 and you know you are			1
’ that puts me under a bit of pressure — if i wave i ’m damned ; if i do n’t wave , i ’m damned			0
i tried to give them a sly little wave , while i was stretching			0
in the end , i came on and i put a cross in for @entity190 , who scored			0
that got me off the hook			0
i think it was a couple of situations like that which made me decide to hang my boots up at the end of the season			0
@entity12 in action for @entity16 at @entity41 against @entity201 in @entity172 in 1986 @entity60 : @entity56 suggested recently that @entity76 needs more protection from officials			1
obviously it was a different type of game in the @entity206			0
hazard : i love to see the skill players so i do n’t want to see them tackled out of existence			0
but if someone says today ’s football is too physical it makes me laugh			0
every game i was kicked			0
i am not sure we have the balance right today			0
@entity217 is a skill and players should be allowed to express that skill as well			0
@entity11 was the best tackler i have ever seen — he was not nasty			1
he was a clever footballer and would adapt today but if he played today like he did then , even though he would take the ball he would be sent off every week ! @entity11 ( left ) of @entity16 tackles @entity223 ’s @entity222 in the 1981 @entity156 final @entity12 and @entity13 featured for the @entity16 side that won the 1982 @entity156 @entity227 in action during a @entity172 match against @entity230 at @entity231 in 1985 @entity11 : i do n’t think the players now help themselves			1
i saw ( @entity234 ) @entity233 roll three or four times the other day and then get up — he is a brilliant player and one of the strong guys but even he ’s rolling			0
@entity12 : the two eras are motorways away from each other in the way rules are implemented			1
i think that ’s a good thing			0
i think sometimes it ’s a little bit over the top , though , with all the protection			0
but in general i like the way the game is going			0
the quality of pitches and the refereeing now makes it so much easier for technical players			0
we ’re all in different eras and if @entity76 had been playing then he would still have been a great player			0
i remember the 1981 fa cup final , @entity258 was trying to put me in row @entity260 that ’s why it ’s so hard to judge @entity85 against @entity263 , because @entity263 used to get kicked from pillar to post every game			2
if he was playing in this era he would be even more frightening			0
@entity60 : is this the best ever @entity15 team ? hazard : of the players when we were playing i ’d say only @entity227 really would get in this side			1
of course , @entity12 would waltz into any team , then or now			1
his football was like @entity275 ’s music			0
but i do n’t know if this @entity15 team is better than @entity56 ’s first go			1
@entity11 : @entity227 scored 35 a year so i think he would get in the @entity15 side now			1
and no doubt that @entity12 would get in			1
but if this is n’t the best @entity15 team then it ’s close			1
i think overall now if they put their best 11 out they are hard for any side in the world to beat			0
@entity12 : with ( @entity286 ) @entity285 up there in his heyday , i think that early team just shades it for me at the moment			1
this team might look a little more stylish			0
they might go on and be better than that team			0
they are very close now			0
this will be a very hard game for @entity16			2
the @entity5 final is one of a record 13 trophy lifts that @entity302 viewers will be able to enjoy at the end of this season			1
from sunday , 2:30pm , fans can follow the highly anticipated final between @entity15 and @entity16 live on @entity302 1 .			1
