he said : ‘ @entity33 is perfectly safe if done properly , with a pretty low complication rate			0
‘ but if you do it in the backstreets for a cheaper rate , you are taking a big gamble			0
‘ surgery in the @entity1 with a reputable surgeon should certainly cost less than £ 10,000			1
it depends on the size of implants			0
’ reality television show star @entity15 , 34 , is reported to have her behind insured for £ 13 million although she denies having it surgically - enhanced			1
dr @entity20 said that he has been carrying out buttock implants for the last 15 to 20 years and when he first started , people were having the procedure ‘ mostly for medical reasons ’ such as muscle - wasting conditions			2
‘ now it ’s roughly a 70:30 ratio in favour of cosmetic surgery , ’ he said			2
@entity57 model @entity55 , 23 , went abroad for surgery because it was half the £ 7,000 price quoted in the @entity1 - but one of her implants burst 10 days later leaving ‘ litres of blood and pus oozing out of my buttocks ' ‘ it used to be a @entity69 and @entity70 thing - in the southern hemisphere , they like shapely buttocks rather than large breasts - whereas in northern countries , the trend used to be the other way round			1
