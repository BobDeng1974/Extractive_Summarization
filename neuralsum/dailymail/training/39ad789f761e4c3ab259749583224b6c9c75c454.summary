by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 23:01 est , 21 july 2013 @entity1 , the ultra-conservative freshman senator from @entity2 , joined other prominent republicans in @entity4 this weekend leading many to speculate that he is looking at a run for president in 2016			1
@entity4 is the first state to hold primary elections , which makes it a popular stop for prospective runners to familiarize themselves with the locals			1
in an interview with @entity14 , @entity1 dodged the 2016 question			1
potential candidate : @entity17 senator @entity1 of @entity2 was in @entity4 this weekend for a @entity19 fundraiser , and his presence may indicate that he 's eyeing a presidential run in 2016 ' i 'm not focused on the politics ... the last office i was elected to was student council			1
so this has been a bit of a whirlwind , ' @entity1 said			2
but many are questioning whether the staunch conservative is even eligible for the office , since @entity1 was born in @entity32			1
the @entity17 constitution states that only ' natural born citizens ' are eligible to occupy the office of president - a term that the constitution does not define			1
though he was born on foreign soil , both of his parents were @entity17 citizens which would have automatically made him a citizen as well			1
and though he walked around the presidential run question , he did seem confident in his eligibility			0
' my mother was born in @entity48 , @entity49			0
she was a @entity17 citizen , so i 'm a @entity17 citizen , ' he said			2
@entity1 said he would not engage in a legal debate about his citizenship			2
' the facts are clear , ' @entity1 said			2
' i can tell you where i was born and who my parents were			0
and then as a legal matter , others can worry about that			0
' there has been debate over whether children of @entity17 parents born outside of the country are officially natural born citizens			1
for example , @entity65 senator @entity64 faced similar questions about his eligibility for the office of president since he was born on a naval base in the @entity72			2
since @entity64 was taken seriously as a candidate in 2008 , @entity1 's @entity32 birth might not be an issue			1
but his foreign birth , and the fact that his father emigrated from @entity79 , are interesting in the perspective of @entity1 's opposition to immigration reform			2
@entity83 : cruz with his @entity79 emigre father @entity84 @entity1 has been an outspoken critic of the immigration bill currently going through @entity86 , especially the fact that it opens up a pathway to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants currently living in the @entity17 the bill is being pushed by @entity93 @entity92 senator @entity92 - another early contender for the @entity19 nomination			1
' i think a path to citizenship for those who are here illegally is profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who followed the rules , ' @entity1 said			0
@entity1 has only been in the @entity101 for six months , drawing comparisons to president @entity103 who was only a freshman senator when he was considered in 2004 as a possible contender for the 2008 elections			1
in his brief career as a senator , @entity1 has become a controversial figure in congress - alienating senators in both parties for his confrontational style			1
@entity1 is an opponent to abortion and a supporter of the second - amendment right to bear arms			0
he believes that president @entity103 used the school shooting in @entity117 as an ' excuse ' to push an anti-gun agenda			0
conservative to the core : @entity1 is unapologetically conservative			0
he 's pro-life and a supporter of the second amendment right to bear arms he believes the reason @entity103 was elected in 2008 was because @entity19 had lost their way and were n't standing by their principles			0
in order to win the @entity129 in 2016 , @entity1 believes the party needs a candidate who is fiercely conservative			0
' if you look at the last 40 years , a consistent pattern emerges			0
anytime @entity19 nominate a candidate for president who runs as a strong conservative , we win			0
and when we nominate a moderate who does n't run as a conservative , we lose			0

the new senator joined other prominent republicans in @entity4 this weekend for a fundraiser
@entity1 was born to @entity17 citizens in @entity32 , where they were working for an oil company at the time
