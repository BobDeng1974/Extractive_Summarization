by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 14:18 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 02:25 est , 13 september 2013 @entity4 tax : @entity6 president @entity5 has called for a tier structure for its flagship mansion tax policy @entity10 ’s most expensive homes should be hit with a ‘ super mansion tax ’ to help raise billions in tax revenues , according to a senior @entity6			1
the party already advocates a 1 per cent tax on homes worth more than £ 2million , but party president @entity5 said those worth more should face an even higher rate			1
he said yesterday : ‘ you could have various rates within the mansion tax			1
a £ 4million property , for example , paying a higher rate			0
’ a tax on expensive properties is also backed by the @entity27 , suggesting it could become a reality if the two parties form a coalition after the next general election			1
mr @entity5 told the @entity33 he wanted to charge people who had properties and wealth at much more than £ 2million ' a higher proportion ' instead of lowering the threshold to catch more properties			2
he said : ' i do take the point that in @entity43 there are many homes that are worth a significant amount of money which would be seen as not exorbitantly luxurious properties			0
' it ’s important that taxation should be progressive			0
’ you could have various rates within the mansion tax - a property worth £ 4million , for example , paying at a higher rate , as well as a higher global sum , than those with smaller properties			2
’ there is a way of doing this without damaging people who are potentially in a more marginal position			0
' mr @entity5 ’s proposal comes just days after @entity65 , the estate agent , warned that under the current plans the @entity6 will fall short of raising their target of £ 1.7billion a year from the mansion tax			1
its research suggested the levy would need to be extended to all homes worth more than £ 1.25million			0
a mansion tax would be levied overwhelmingly on @entity43 and the @entity75 , where eight out of ten £ 2million - plus homes are located			1
near the capital : this four - bedroom detached home in @entity80 is on the market for £ 1.35million , enough for the mansion tax if it was reduced to £ 1.25million			2
the plans are also opposed by the conservatives , which believe that while the initial threshold of any mansion tax would be set very high , it would be progressively brought down until eventually it hits ‘ ordinary family homes ’			1
@entity89 , the @entity90 chairman , said : ‘ families who live in suburbs [ will ] discover they are living in mansions , not ordinary homes			0
' they start off calling it a mansion tax but [ it ] will gradually bear down on hard - working families as the threshold comes down further			2
’ the @entity6 unveiled their original mansion tax policy in 2009 but were quickly forced to raise the threshold from £ 1million to £ 2million amid concerns about the number of homeowners who would be affected , particularly in @entity43			1
█ @entity104 ’s fiercest @entity6 critic has said he should be ousted because his personal ratings are as bad as @entity27 ’s least successful leader , @entity106			0
as party members gather for the start of their annual conference in @entity112 tomorrow , @entity113 , who warned that the @entity6 could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next general election , added : ‘ it ’s nothing personal , you ’ve got to look at the facts			0

@entity27 president @entity5 called for tiers of tax on homes today
@entity27 backs a mansion tax but @entity125 *remain* opposed to the idea
the policy could be central to any further coalition talks
