from smartbands to high - end pedometers , never before have there been so many gadgets that claim to monitor health and boost fitness			1
but as technology gallops ahead , most come at a considerable financial cost			0
now researchers have found that smartphone apps that track an physical activity are in fact just as accurate as many fitness gadgets			1
a stock image of the @entity19 is pictured the study compared the performance of a five devices - including @entity24 ’s @entity23 , the @entity25 and @entity19 - against five apps			1
they analysed their ability to count steps as these are often used to calculate other measures of physical activity , such as distance covered or calories			1
a total of 14 participants walked on a treadmill for 500 and 1,500 steps , multiple times , while different technologies counted their footsteps , according to a new research letter in the @entity42 ( @entity42 )			0
‘ in this study , we wanted to address one of the challenges with using wearable devices : they must be accurate , said @entity49 medical student and lead study author , @entity50			1
‘ after all , if a device is going to be effective at monitoring - and potentially changing - behaviour , individuals have to be able to trust the data			0
’ the study was based 10 devices and apps ’ ability to count steps and popular wearables			1

step counts are often used to derive other measures of physical activity , such as distance or calories in the study , a total of 14 participants walked on a treadmill for 500 and 1,500 steps , multiple times , while technology counted their footsteps to determine the accuracy of the apps and gadgets			2
a stock image of a women who was n't involved in the study , is pictured @entity82 moves app @entity85 app @entity86 app @entity88 5s @entity19 app @entity90 @entity25 @entity19 @entity19 @entity91 @entity92 - 200 ‘ we found that smartphone apps are just as accurate as wearable devices for tracking physical activity			1
’ the study is a follow - up to a recent @entity42 viewpoint suggesting that there 's little evidence that wearable devices alone can change behaviour and improve health for those that need it most			2
in the experiment , each of the healthy adults wore a waistband with one pedometer and two accelerometers attached , as well as three wearables on their wrist and two smartphones in their pockets			0
the @entity88 ran three apps - moves , @entity86 and @entity19 - while the @entity119 ran one @entity63 app. at the end of each trial , step counts from each device were recorded			1
the 10 top - selling devices and fitness apps in the @entity127 that were tested , were : galaxy @entity82 moves app , iphone 5s moves app , @entity132 app , @entity134 app , as well as @entity24 ’s @entity23 , the @entity25 , @entity19 , @entity135 and the @entity136			1
the data from the smartphones were only slightly different than the observed step counts , with a range of minus 6.7 to 6.2 percent relative difference in mean step count			0
the results suggest that the @entity135 and @entity91 devices are the most accurate surveyed , while @entity24 's @entity23 ( pictured ) , appears to have the largest margin for error in the 500 and 1,500 step trials			0
however , over all , smartphone apps performed as accurately as wearables but the data from the wearable devices differed more , with a range of between minus 22.7 to minus 1.5 percent			1
the results suggest that the @entity135 and @entity91 devices are the most accurate surveyed , while @entity24 's @entity23 , appears to have the largest margin for error in the 500 and 1,500 step trials			0
apps such as moves for @entity88 proved fairly accurate			2
the free app automatically tracks walking , running and cycling and shows a user 's day as a simple storyline			0
it counts steps and shows calories burned for each activity			0
professor @entity168 , an attending physician at the @entity169 , who also teaches at the university , said : ‘ since step counts are such an important part of how these devices and apps measure physical activity , including calculating distance or calories burned , their accuracy is key			2
‘ compared to the one to two percent of adults in the @entity127 that own a wearable device , more than 65 percent of adults carry a smartphone			0
our findings suggest that smartphone apps could prove to be a more widely accessible and affordable way of tracking health behaviours			2

researchers at the @entity49 tested 10 best - selling apps and fitness gadgets by using them to count steps taken by *volunteers*
they tested apps such as moves and devices including the @entity19
found smartphone apps are just as accurate as some fitness gadgets
