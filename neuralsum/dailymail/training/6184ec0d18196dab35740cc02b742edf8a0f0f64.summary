@entity1 i resume : further @entity2 the start of the second volume of @entity7 ’s memoirs finds him alone in his house in @entity10 on his 40th birthday having just been dumped by his @entity13 girlfriend , @entity14			1
sitting at the kitchen table , feeling uncharacteristically glum , he tries to work out what , if anything , he ever did for her			2
at first his mind is blank			2
then , with a tiny glimmer of pride , he remembers that he once helped her to resurface a tennis court			2
later on , to buck himself up , @entity7 goes off to do a bit of tree - trimming with a chain - saw			1
‘ i decided to attack a large , solid branch some 20 feet off the ground			2
unfortunately , it happened to be the one i was sitting on			0
’ some people , rather unkindly , have suggested that @entity7 is a paler version of his son , @entity33 but it seems he is in a class of his own some people , rather unkindly , have suggested that @entity7 is a paler version of his son , @entity33 — a kind of early draft of the real thing			1
but as swiftly becomes clear , when it comes to inserting every last millimetre of his foot into his mouth , @entity7 is in a class of his own			1
to begin with at least , barely a page goes by without some example of his forgetfulness , clumsiness , or incompetence , all driven home with a liberal smattering of exclamation marks			0
soon after @entity14 dumps him , he meets his new next - door neighbour in @entity56 — a slim , dark - haired woman called @entity57			1
@entity58 to ingratiate himself , @entity7 offers to take her two dogs for a walk			1
within seconds of letting the dogs out of the car , he manages to lose them both			2
@entity57 , however , is evidently the forgiving type			1
not long afterwards , they get married			0
much of @entity7 ’s life has passed in a chaotically unreflective whirl , unimpeded by any self - doubt , he does have his serious side when he takes his children on a motor boat , the engine drops off ; when he helps himself to a midnight snack at the house of some friends , he destroys their fridge ; when he ’s asked to come out to @entity77 to do a piece on animal migration , he gets on a flight to @entity81 instead			1
but while much of @entity7 ’s life has passed in a chaotically unreflective whirl , unimpeded by any twinge of self - doubt , he does have his serious side			1
as he ’s keen to remind us , he was an mep for five years , sitting in ‘ the second - safest @entity87 seat in the @entity88 ’ , and when he was in @entity89 , he proposed several important pieces of legislation , all to do with animal welfare			1
if you ’re going to read about the inner workings of the @entity88 , then @entity7 is probably as good a guide as any			1
even so , there are several times here when his normally bouncy prose style seems to have put on a large pair of diving boots			0
‘ i have already mentioned that i was responsible for drafting the @entity104 ’s @entity103 ( @entity105 ) , ’ he notes at one point			2
indeed you have , indeed you have			0
mercifully we do n’t stay stuck in the @entity88 quagmire for too long			0
inbetween drafting environmental legislation , @entity7 writes a number of novels — one of which , @entity108 , must be a leading candidate for the most unappealing title ever published			1
another , the commissioner , was made into a film starring @entity118			0
‘ you can still buy the video on @entity121 , ’ he notes helpfully			0
but anyone who thinks that writing a novel automatically involves being plunged into creative agonies should think again			0
rather than sit down and sweat at a desk , ‘ i bought a pocket @entity127 and spouted away in taxis or airport lounges ’			0
not surprisingly , the results were somewhat patchy : ‘ once i even forgot what sex one of the key protagonists was			0
’ although it seems barely credible , @entity7 won the @entity135 for poetry when he was at @entity137			1
his fondness for versifying has not dwindled with the years and he includes some examples of his efforts here			2
i ’ll spare you these on humanitarian grounds , but suffice it to say that the poet laureate , @entity146 , is unlikely to be shaking in her shoes			0
@entity7 and his wife @entity57 who he met after offering to take her dogs out for a walk , but then lost both of them along the way he manages to father another two children , to go with the four that he had with his first wife			1
it comes as no surprise to learn that @entity7 could n’t remember their names when he was being interviewed on live tv , prompting one of his daughters to burst into tears			1
‘ how could you , @entity167 ? ’ she sobbed			0
‘ how could you forget our names like that ? ’ @entity7 has a spasm of guilt , but like any dark cloud in his life it soon passes and his normal sunny surface is resumed			1
as for his theories on child care , these seem unlikely to find much favour with dr @entity185 , the @entity186 : ‘ having had a great deal of experience of such matters , i have long since concluded that there is absolutely no need to be within earshot of young children			0
’ but he ’s clearly done something right			2
all his children seem cheerful , bright and well - adjusted , albeit hell - bent on world domination			0
the ambition , as far as he can tell , comes from @entity7 ’s @entity195 mother , who taught him that ‘ basically anything was do - able and that , as she would put it , there is no such word as ca n’t ’			1
by the end of this maddeningly uneven yet still thoroughly engaging book , @entity7 has brought his story up to date			2
at 74 , there is no dimming of the light , still less any desire to slip into the shadows			0
recently , he and the former @entity210 foreign correspondent @entity209 were guests on the tv game show pointless , which , he writes , ‘ goes out at 5.15 every afternoon and apparently has between five and six million viewers ’			0
and then he ca n’t resist adding : ‘ we very much hope to be invited back			0
