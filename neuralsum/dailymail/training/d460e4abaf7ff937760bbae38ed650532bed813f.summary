@entity0 suffered a huge blow on friday when @entity2 was ruled out for at least three more weeks after suffering another injury in training			1
manager @entity5 had been hoping the striker ’s return to fitness would be a boost to his faltering side			1
now @entity2 , who injured his calf during a warm - up at @entity13 on thursday , will miss a number of crucial games , including home and away @entity18 group games against mighty @entity19			1
@entity0 striker @entity2 is expected to be out of action for around three weeks @entity2 has been sidelined since picking up a thigh injury while on international duty with @entity23 @entity0 manager @entity5 was hoping to welcome back @entity2 to his starting line - up 1			1
@entity0 v @entity30 @entity0 have seven games in the next three weeks , including a last 16 @entity33 tie against @entity28 on october 28 and a @entity35 clash against @entity30 at @entity36 on november 8			1
@entity2 was recovering from a thigh problem suffered on @entity23 duty in september			1
the injury led to a rift between @entity5 and @entity23 manager @entity41 over the striker ’s recovery schedule			1
despite @entity5 doing his best to play it down on friday , lingering bad feeling remains , after @entity41 suggested that the @entity0 manager ’s practice of having a two - day recovery period for players after games is a waste of time			1
ironically , @entity2 could be fit just as @entity41 is building up to @entity23 ’s next @entity54 qualifying game against @entity55 on november 15			1
@entity2 , pictured scoring against @entity57 at the @entity58 , could return to action against @entity55 the fall - out from the last @entity54 tie continued on friday with @entity5 suggesting that @entity41 failed @entity62 by revealing publicly that the forward had admitted to feeling tired ahead of the @entity65 game			1
according to the @entity36 boss , @entity62 , who is in @entity0 ’s line - up to face @entity26 , returned to @entity68 this week shaken by the furore surrounding his omission from the @entity23 team			1
@entity5 believes @entity41 should have kept the conversation he had with @entity62 in the build - up to the game private and hinted that he feels the @entity23 boss needs to learn a lesson			1
@entity5 said : ‘ every conversation you have with a player is private			1
‘ that ’s how i work and i am sure @entity41 will probably look at this episode going forward and analyse where he can be better on it			1
‘ i ’m sure when they [ @entity62 and @entity41 ] meet up next they will speak on that and clear that up			1
‘ my only focus is getting @entity62 ’s confidence up			2
all this shook him a bit but he has been brilliant in training			0
this is a kid we bring up to be responsible and be honest			0
’ the @entity0 manager is incandescent that some people believe @entity62 actually asked not to play for @entity23 last weekend			1
@entity5 has questioned @entity41 's handling of @entity0 and @entity23 starlet @entity62 asked if the @entity96 should have clarified this , @entity5 said : ‘ maybe			1
i ca n’t control what he [ @entity41 ] says or thinks			2
‘ what has been disappointing and grossly unfair is how the kid has been on the back page for something he did not say			0
‘ he did not say he was not able to play			0
what he said was he felt tired , and what you do is take on board all the information and then make a decision			0
so you respect @entity41 ’s decision not to play him			2
‘ @entity41 is a manager with great experience who has been around the game long enough and all managers deal with situations differently			2
‘ but i have one thing to clear up			0
i have seen a lot written about the second - day recovery			2
‘ people think @entity0 players are at home on day two with their feet up watching @entity122			2
that could n’t be further from the truth			0
@entity0 boss @entity5 believes @entity23 manager @entity41 could have dealt with @entity62 differently @entity5 and @entity62 shared a joke on friday as @entity0 geared up for their league fixture against @entity26 ‘ my belief and training model is to make players better			1
part of that is recovery as my game is about pressing and playing at a high physical level			0
our second - day recovery is technically a session			2
the space we play in is very small to reduce the intensity			0
‘ that has worked for me all the way through my life and has kept players fit and fresh			0
‘ that has helped people here like @entity146 to play as many games ( as he has )			0
recovery is vital , physical and mental			0
i take great pride in it and give it a lot of focus			0
‘ i ’m not waiting for a thesis to give me evidence			0
we ’re at the edge of the game creating evidence ourselves			0
’ this week former @entity0 players @entity159 and @entity160 have suggested it was unusual for a player to give a manager an excuse to leave him out by admitting he was tired			2
@entity159 ( left ) and @entity160 ( right ) were both critical of @entity62 's decision to admit he was tired @entity5 said : ‘ the speed of the game is different even to what it was five years ago			1
players can not play every game at the top level , in particular young players			0
if you put too many miles on the clock , you will break them and they will end up finished at 26 or 27			0
‘ what i ’ve been really proud of in watching @entity62 is his honesty and responsibility			2
responsibility is for a 19 - year - old boy to say he was tired			0
this is a kid who loves playing			0
he never misses a day ’s training , the work ethic he puts in for his game is fantastic			0
he loves playing for @entity23			2
‘ around the time of getting the call - up i see the excitement in his eyes			0
this is a boy that felt a bit tired and if you asked half or three - quarters of the squad they will probably have said they felt a bit tired too			0
’ @entity5 also hinted he would have no problem with @entity62 playing in next summer ’s under 21 @entity201			1
@entity5 hopes events of the last month will not sour his relationship with the @entity96 or with @entity41			1
he said : ‘ we have served @entity23 well with the numbers of players we push through for the national team and the style of football we play			2

@entity0 ace @entity2 could miss @entity0 's next seven games
the @entity23 international is likely to sit out his side 's @entity18 two @entity18 *showdowns* against @entity19
