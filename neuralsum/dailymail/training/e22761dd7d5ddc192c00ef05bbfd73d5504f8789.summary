by @entity0 published : 20:39 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 20:39 est , 13 december 2012 it ’s as much a part of @entity3 as the @entity4 or dirty - water hot dogs			1
but the traditional taxi hail could soon be a thing of the past			1
the city ’s @entity9 announced today to approve a pilot program allowing riders to use their smartphones to ‘ e-hail ’ a yellow cab as early as next february			1
the technological step is revolutionary for many reasons , with one being that before now , it has been illegal for the iconic taxicabs to pre-arrange rides			1
thing of the past : a new app will allow passengers to ' e-hail ' cabs , making for a lot less exasperated commuters ( stock photo ) the tests , which are slated to start on february 15 , are an answer to a growing question of how smartphones have been used for transport around the city			1
@entity35 fun : the @entity35 app is available in other cities ; its @entity3 pilot version will be tested for a year ' we should not ignore technology that 's out there			1
this is not speculative , this is real , ' commissioner @entity43 told the @entity46			0
the commission issued a news release after the vote celebrating what it called ' appy days ahead			0
' the system will be tried out for one year			2
after the free apps start linking customers with drivers in mid-february , the commission will produce quarterly reports on the program 's success , leading to a decision on whether to extend it			1
at least a dozen companies are ready to provide the service , including ones now operating in other @entity65 cities and overseas			0
@entity66 has a thriving taxi e-hail system			2
commission research showed drivers still prefer to pick up gesturing passengers , @entity43 said			2
' they 'll still tend to pick up a ride that 's there first , ' he said			0
' i think drivers will use the app when there 's no passenger out there			1
' @entity80 , a cabbie waiting for customers near @entity82 , said he 'll respond to app hails if his cab owner wants him to			1
the 56 - year - old driver said that personally , he felt checking his phone for a customer 's location ' is going to be a distraction , and it could cause accidents ' — even if the cell phone is mounted			0
no need to lift a finger : hailing a taxi on a @entity3 street is going high - tech , with a smartphone application a potential fare uses the app to request a ride			1
that request goes out to all participating cabbies within a certain distance , and the cabbie who uses his or her own cellphone to respond first will get the fare			0
city law prohibits drivers from talking on handheld cellphones , but they will be able to use them to respond to an e-hail			0
the electronic system is optional for cab companies			0
the commission was subject to lobbying from the service car industry , which fears loss of business if yellow cabs are allowed to prearrange rides			2
the commissioner said the city will make sure both drivers and customers are protected			0
the driver should be able to accept a ride with a single touch after receiving a passenger signal , @entity43 said			0
distance limits will be built into the technology			0
for example , from @entity131 to @entity132 in @entity133 — the primary business zone — yellow cabs will be allowed to respond to an electronic hail within a half - mile			2
elsewhere in the city , the limit is a mile and a half			0
customers may pay by using apps that interact with the technology being used in a particular yellow cab , according to @entity146 spokesman @entity145 .			1

@entity146 announced pilot program allowing riders to *digitally* hail a cab via a smartphone app
taxi drivers in @entity3 have not been allowed to pre-arrange rides before
program will be tested for one year , starting on february 15
