girls are still being brought up to believe that raising a family is more important than pursuing their personal goals , according to @entity9			1
she said schoolgirls needed to learn they were free to make their own decisions about how to balance their careers with bringing up a child			0
child rearers : young women are being held back by the belief they should put their children before their own ambitions , a leading headmistress has warned mrs @entity9 , the new president of the @entity18 ’ @entity19 , criticised the continuing assumption that women should be responsible for childcare			1
this was despite the emergence of a generation of ‘ very caring ’ young men who have an affinity with children			0
young women are also going to university in greater numbers than men and achieving more than ever in the workplace			0
in her first interview as president , mrs @entity9 told how pupils at her all - girls school - £ 10,750 - a - year @entity34 - were shocked by a talk from a female entrepreneur who told them she put her career before her child			1
mrs @entity9 said she regularly runs a course for pupils which covers entrepreneurial and leadership skills and features outside speakers			1
‘ eighteen months ago , one of the young entrepreneurs , a lady , dared to say that she had probably put her business ahead of her son , and the sharp intake of breath from all of the girls was audible , ’ she said			2
‘ they were all absolutely shocked , so yes , we are still creating a generation of girls who think that the whole idea of looking after children is really the most important thing , once you have a child			1
‘ and who ’s to say ? that ’s a whole ethical , moral argument			0
and it ’s a very , very personal decision			2
‘ but , what ’s maybe less personal , and maybe more incumbent on us as leaders in girls ’ schools , is to try and get girls to see that it is a decision , and that there are options , and that it ’s not wrong , and that ’s where society needs to come into play as well			1
‘ it ’s not wrong to make a particular decision , whatever it is			2
’ mrs @entity9 said it was the responsibility of girls ’ schools to help their pupils to ‘ be strong in making decisions , and secure in the rightness of the decision that they have made ’			1
@entity9 says girls are still being brought up to believe that raising a family is more important than pursuing their personal goals ( file photo ) she added there was ‘ probably still the assumption ’ that women will deal with childcare			1
‘ there has been an increase in the number of house - husbands , but the very fact that it is still newsworthy means it ’s not accepted as the norm , ’ she told the @entity96			0
‘ i think there ’s a long way to go before there ’s total equality in that area			0
’ she said it was now well - known that girls were going to university in increasing numbers			2
but mrs @entity9 added : ‘ we do still expect women to be at the core of the relationship , the homemaker , the person who brings up children and thinks about what everyone ’s going to eat every day			1
it ’s still , i think , unusual to find a man doing that			0
’ men are largely still seen as the parent who will go out to work to support the family , she said			2
but she was ‘ quite struck ’ that young men nowadays are ‘ very caring and do want to have children and do have an affinity with children			0
’ in a wide - ranging interview , mrs @entity9 also urged girls to develop ‘ soft skills ’ as well as clocking up exam passes			1
‘ yes , you need your exam results , you need your degree , but it ’s a passport for opening a door , getting through a door , and then when you are actually working , there ’s so many other things out there in society that you need , which is why it ’s so good that girls ’ schools , really good schools , and universities do so much more than teach the subjects , teach facts			1
‘ it ’s so much more than sitting in front of a computer , it ’s developing all of those other skills			0
’ and she raised concerns that @entity155 plans to scrap gcses and replace them with more rigorous exams may ‘ make a failing system more complicated and possibly more prone to absolute collapse in the end ’			0
she said the @entity161 was right ‘ to make the system more rigorous and fit for purpose ’ but argued the planned new exams would ‘ not suit a huge proportion of children ’ .			0

girls brought up believing raising a family is more important than aspirations
@entity171 said girls ' schools should help pupils be strong in decision making
