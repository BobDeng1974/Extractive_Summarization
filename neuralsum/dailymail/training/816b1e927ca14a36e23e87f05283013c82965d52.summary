earning welfare : teens will be told to c ollect rubbish jobless youngsters will be forced to pick up litter or carry out other community work if they want to receive benefits , @entity3 will say today			1
in a major speech on @entity11 welfare plans , the prime minister will claim it is wrong for them to be allowed to go straight on to the dole			2
he will pledge that a future @entity11 government will introduce mandatory community work for unemployed youngsters in order to instil the ‘ discipline of turning up for work each day ’			1
mr @entity3 said last night that making young people work for their dole would help them ‘ make something of their lives ’ and ensure they gave something back to their community in return for ‘ help ’ from the government			1
the move is part of @entity11 plans to ‘ abolish ’ the scourge of long - term youth unemployment			1
under original plans , claimants would only receive benefits for six months before being required to start an apprenticeship or carry out community work			2
but @entity11 sources said the scheme would now be ‘ turbo - charged ’ to require young people to carry out community work from the first day of their claim			1
any young person who has not been in education , training or work during the previous six months will be asked to undertake daily volunteer work in order to qualify for their handouts			0
the plan will affect around 50,000 young people a year who currently go straight on to the dole			0
mr @entity3 said the plans were ‘ not just about saving money ’ but about breaking the cycle of welfare dependency			1
‘ our welfare reforms are about changing lives and making this a country that rewards work and gives everyone the chance of a better future , ’ he said			1
‘ we want to get rid of that well - worn path from the school gate , down to the @entity72 , and onto a life on benefits			2
‘ from day one they must realise that welfare is not a one - way street			2
yes , we will help them , but there is no more something for nothing			0
they must give back to their community too			0
’ mr @entity3 said last night that making young people work for their dole would help them ‘ make something of their lives ’ the @entity88 have already pledged to abolish @entity90 ’ allowance for those aged 18 - 21 and replace it with a time - limited @entity92 if they win power in may			1
the existing @entity94 , which can include making meals for older people or working for local charities , typically involves 30 hours a week for three months plus ten hours of job - seeking activity a week			0
sources said community work placements have been shown to be more effective in getting claimants off benefits than just signing on			0
a pilot scheme in @entity104 requiring youngsters to do community work from the first day of their claim has proved even more effective			0
the plan is expected to cost about £ 20million a year to deliver			0
sources said this would come from savings produced by the roll - out of the universal credit scheme .			0
