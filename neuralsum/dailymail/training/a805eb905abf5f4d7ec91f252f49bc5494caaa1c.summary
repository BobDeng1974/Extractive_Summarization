click here to see all the stats , goals and heatmaps from our brilliant @entity4 the fat lady has n't started to sing yet			0
she ’s barely warming up			0
and @entity7 knows football can be a cruel mistress			2
@entity10 discovered that this time last year when @entity14 were top of the @entity16 by four points and , eventually , they self destructed			1
@entity18 find themselves in similar surroundings			2
they are six points clear of @entity22 and the seventh club in @entity16 history to go unbeaten in their opening 14 games			1
of the others , three went on to become champions , the rest failed			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity18 players celebrate @entity33 's goal against @entity34 that has maintained their unbeaten start @entity36 boss @entity7 has a history of winning silverware in his second season in charge the @entity41 is hoisted in the air after winning @entity43 in his second year with @entity44 click here to read @entity46 columinists @entity47 and @entity49 's views of the two - horse title races it ’s a good start but that ’s about all it is , despite @entity7 ’s mantra proving a hit once more			1
the @entity18 manager has a history of producing his best work not in the first year , but the second			1
at @entity60 and @entity61 , @entity7 won the @entity62 in his second season			1
at @entity44 , the @entity41 manager beat @entity66 ’s all - conquering @entity65 to the @entity43 title			1
at @entity18 , he is projected to break their own @entity16 record of 95 points , perhaps scoring more than a century			1
they currently have 36 points with a hypothetical 72 to play for in this , @entity7 ’s second season at @entity74 following a third - place finish behind @entity76 and @entity22 respectively last year			1
high flying @entity18 are on course to beat @entity7 's record points haul of 95 @entity18 players take part in a training session ahead of their next @entity16 game with @entity83 it can be no coincidence			1
@entity7 , too , acknowledges having a year to settle in , to make his mark , to get his squad playing the way he feels best			1
‘ i think the second season is a privileged place to have the team in very good conditions , ’ he said in september 2014			2
‘ there are teams and managers who work 10 or 15 years with the same team , and step by step with conditions to improve all the time			0
‘ but i think the second season is a good space for evolution , for improvement and for the team to be in the right condition			2
’ @entity104 ( centre ) and @entity106 have arguably been the best signings of the summer @entity104 has given @entity18 the prolific striker they needed after @entity109 ' ( left ) struggles in west @entity110 @entity111 has turned back the clock by scoring goals on his return to @entity74 so , what makes them such an unbeatable force this year compared to last ? can it really come down to something as simple as the new blood ? five players in - @entity104 , @entity106 , @entity111 , @entity124 and @entity125 - at a cost of £ 88.3million , almost half of which was paid for by getting rid of @entity127 to @entity128			1
not to mention the return of goalkeeper @entity130 from @entity131 and @entity132 in january , too			2
the hype has firmly surrounded @entity104			0
the 26 - year - old has single - handedly lifted the curse of @entity18 strikers at @entity74 , bringing 11 goals to the @entity16 in 916 minutes , seven of which were scored after his first four games			1
hence the excitement when calculations revealed it took @entity109 43 games to match that same total			0
@entity111 and @entity124 , too , have proved suitable back - up , as @entity7 reiterated in an @entity149 - told - you - so kind of way after a goal apiece against @entity152 wednesday night			2
@entity106 has been an inspiration and has already racked up 10 assists so far this season @entity132 ( left ) provides the steel to accompany @entity106 ' silk in @entity18 's midfield @entity132 's heat map against @entity159 - he became one of the first players to cover 100 miles in the league but those behind are the workhorses			1
@entity106 has contributed 10 assists this year and , as the record stands at 20 by @entity165 , the @entity18 midfielder is well on his way to surpassing the total of his former @entity14 team - mate			1
@entity106 , much to the annoyance of @entity10 , averages twice as many touches per game than his fellow signings			2
again , it can be no coincidence			0
if that does n’t outline the 27 - year - old ’s tirelessness , then this might : he and midfield partner @entity132 officially became the first players this season to cover more than 100 miles on the pitch			1
all this is not to say there are n't times when @entity18 can come unstuck and they have to rely on a smidgen of fortune			2
take , for example , their 0 - 0 stalemate against @entity159			0
@entity190 ’s blueprint to halt the @entity7 train worked to perfection , namely because he starved @entity18 ’s midfield and service to @entity104 , who was driven to distraction by @entity196			1
@entity197 tackles @entity159 are the only team to have stopped @entity18 scoring in the league @entity106 ran the show against @entity201 ( left ) but he was comparatively nullified by @entity159 ( right ) @entity18 are the seventh team in @entity16 history to remain unbeaten after the opening 14 games			1
here 's the previous best unbeaten runs , and how the team 's fared ... @entity14 ( 2003 - 04 ) – 38 games , won the league @entity209 ( 2010 - 11 ) – 24 games , won the league @entity14 ( 2007 - 08 ) – 15 games , did not win the league @entity22 ( 2012 - 13 ) – 15 games , did not win the league @entity22 ( 2011 - 12 ) – 14 games , won the league @entity76 ( 2007 - 08 ) – 14 games , did not win the league they came as close a side have to ending @entity7 's record			1
' we played to win against a team that defended with nine players			0
it ’s just to be objective about their strategy			0
we could n’t break them , ’ @entity7 analysed afterwards			2
@entity106 managed 94 per cent completion with 153 passes against @entity201 previously			2
at the @entity232 , he was down to 88 per cent with just 112 as @entity46 ’s @entity4 shows			0
@entity159 shut @entity18 down for 90 minutes and escaped with a hard - earned point			2
others are likely to try the same , which may be why @entity7 feels going 38 not out is unthinkable			0
still , @entity18 look a far cry from the team that ‘ parked the bus ’ under @entity239 against @entity65 in the @entity62 semi-final of 2012			1
they no longer turn to that strategy , even though the wheels never fell off			0
they won the final at the @entity244 in @entity245 against @entity246 , spoiled the @entity248 party , and @entity239 went his own way			0
@entity18 have not had to revert to the spoiling tactics that brought them victory over @entity65 in 2012 @entity252 is one of several players who have contributed to @entity18 's 33 league goals this season but there ’s a new approach this year , a more direct one at that by @entity7			1
@entity18 make 53 more passes per game on average these days			0
they have a better completion rate , are opting for shorter passes , are more clinical in the final third and , to be blunt , know they can score more than the opposition on their day			0
the averages just keep rising			0
their goals per game has shifted from 1.87 to 2.36 , their shot accuracy has gone from 45 per cent to 54 , and they are yet to concede a goal through an error			0
despite their impressive record even @entity7 has said that going the whole season unbeaten is ' impossible ' they have 33 goals in 14 matches through @entity104 , @entity106 , @entity276 , having scored 71 in total last year			1
@entity18 dominate the game , dictate it to their liking , and @entity34 were the latest to come to terms with that			0
sure , there is a degree of luck			0
in football there always is			0
but @entity18 are a whole different component this year to last , as @entity7 continues to prove why his second time around is far better than the first			1
all statistics for this were supplied via @entity291 and @entity292			0

@entity7 won the @entity62 ( with @entity60 and @entity61 ) and @entity43 with @entity44 in his second year in charge
the @entity36 are six points clear of @entity22 in the @entity16
@entity106 and @entity132 have ran more 100m each this season
@entity7 is projected to beat his own @entity16 record of 95 points
@entity18 became seventh team in @entity16 history to go unbeaten in their first 14 games before their run came to an end against @entity83
