delighted @entity0 carries daughter @entity1 , two , after battling back from a rare and crippling illness a mother has told of her joy at being able to carry her daughter again for the first time since she was a baby , after being struck down by a rare and crippling illness			1
@entity0 , 22 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was left semi-paralysed after contracting the nervous system disorder @entity13 syndrome over a year ago			1
the disease , which affects just one in 100,000 people , caused her to loose all feeling in her hands and feet and left her unable to walk			1
but worst of all it meant she was unable to care for daughter @entity20 , who was then just nine - months - old			1
but after battling back for over a year , mrs @entity0 has finally regained the strength to carry @entity22 , now two , for the first time			1
she said : ' words ca n't describe how i feel to be able to hold @entity22			2
' it 's almost like having a part of myself back			0
i have n't been able to hold her since she was seven months old			0
' at long last i just feel like i can be a mam again			0
' mrs @entity0 caught an apparently relatively harmless sickness bug but when she was unable to fight it off she was admitted to hospital			1
two weeks later , after a battery of tests , the mother - of - one was diagnosed with the disease , which not only left her unable to walk , but also affected her so much that she could not even hold @entity1			1
she is currently attending @entity35 in the @entity36 of @entity10 , where she is undergoing intensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation work with the medical and nursing staff			0
she said : ' i 'm getting much better now and i can walk around the house			2
i am still not back to the way i was but i 'm using my mobility scooter to get out and about outside			0
' mrs @entity0 and her husband @entity46 , 26 , originally from @entity47 , met seven years ago and had tried for a baby for five years			1
come on mum : the disease , which affects just one in 100,000 people , caused mrs @entity0 to loose all feeling in her hands and feet and left her unable to walk but agonisingly , the qualified nursery nurse suffered 14 miscarriages			1
the couple were delighted when she then gave birth to @entity22			0
mrs @entity0 , who already suffered from fibromyalgia , a long - term condition that causes pain all over the body , spent eight weeks at @entity10 's @entity63			1
she is now hoping to set up a charity which offers help to other people in the region suffering from @entity68			0
she said : ' there just does n't seem to be anything out there to support people at our age with @entity68			0
' @entity68 is a rare and unusual condition that occurs when the body 's immune system attacks parts of the nervous system			0
the exact cause of the syndrome is unknown , but symptoms usually begin to develop one to three weeks after a minor infection , such as a cold or sore throat			2
the symptoms , which include pain , tingling and numbness and muscle weakness , often start in the feet and hands before spreading to thearms and then your legs			1
sufferers may also experience co-ordination problems and unsteadiness			0
the weakness normally affects both sides of the body and it may get worse over several days			0
most sufferers ( around 80 per cent ) make a full recovery			0
however that can involve spending weeks in hospital and it may take a year or more to fully recover			2
about one or two people in every 10 will not recover completely from @entity68 , although others can make a full recovery			2
long - term complications include not being able to walk unaided , a loss of sensation , loss of balance and muscle weakness in the arms or legs .			2

@entity0 , left *helpless* after contracting @entity13 syndrome
she lost all feeling in her hands and feet and was left unable to walk
she was unable to care for baby @entity1 and it took over a year to recover
