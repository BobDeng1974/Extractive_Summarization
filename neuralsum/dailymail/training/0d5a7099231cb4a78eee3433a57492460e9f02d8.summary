but last spring the @entity74 appeal court ordered the investigation to be resumed when new evidence about @entity14 emerged from investigations carried out by @entity25 gendarmes			1

he carried out his murders in association with his wife , @entity54 , from 1987 to 1990 and again in 2000 to 2001			0
the couple met in prison , when she agreed to help him abduct young women if he promised to kill her first husband			0
he was arrested in 2003 after trying to kidnap a @entity97 girl , and @entity68 later revealed his other crimes too			0
the pair were convicted and sentenced in 2008			0
she told gendarmes that one night her boyfriend returned home with scratches on his face and with a jean bag similar to one that @entity20 had been carrying			1

a second girlfriend of @entity14 told police that he had boasted of having been involved in two murders			2
one took place in 1990 , the year @entity20 died			1
according to the second girlfriend 's witness account , the version @entity14 gave her was that his victim was suffocated by a pillow and her body concealed in woods near a place called @entity121 which is fifteen miles from the place where @entity2 was found			2
the @entity124 student was strangled after her hands and feet had been bound and her body flung into a river			0
she had gone to meet a man who had answered her advert for private @entity131 lessons			0
the second crime @entity14 is alleged to have boasted about involved a woman whose naked body was discovered beside a motorway in the south of @entity6 in 1997			2

‘ at the present time he is in prison , ' she said			0
' the judge in charge of the investigation will study the new evidence in september and will then decide whether to place him under formal investigation			0
