health experts are warning about the the serious health problems that can be triggered by wearing an ill - fitting bra			1
they say that seemingly unrelated conditions including skin rashes , tendonitis and even indigestion can be caused by poorly fitting undergarments , especially if you have large breasts			1
it is thought that four in five women wear an ill - fitting bra because they tend to underestimate the width of their back , while overestimating their cup size			1
ill - fitting bras can trigger a wide range of conditions - from indigestion to tendonitis - because the underwear affects posture and the positioning of internal organs @entity25 , a chiropractor practising in @entity26 , said : ‘ women come into my clinic on a regular basis showing rounded shoulders , curves in the back , indigestion due to the diaphragm and lungs being restricted , marks from straps and underwires , dents in the shoulders : all the signs of an ill - fitting bra			1
' she says that one of the biggest problems is that women are regularly fitted with bras that are far too big in the cup			2
' this then means the straps are too big so they are continually tightened , which then pulls the shoulders and neck down , curving the spine and creating tension and discomfort			0
retired school teacher @entity55 suffered a hiatus hernia because of an underwired bra ' the underwire can creep up because of straps that are too tight and pressure builds around the stomach and lower oesophagus			1
tissues that end up being pushed and pulled in unnatural directions			0
' one woman who has suffered the effects of an ill - fitting bra is @entity55			1
@entity55 , a 62 - year - old retired teacher from @entity68 , said her hiatus hernia , ibs and indigestion were all caused by wearing an ineffective underwired bra			1
i have suffered from a range of complaints which , after speaking to specialists , i now realise are largely a consequence of wearing bras that never properly supported me			2
‘ i have suffered from hiatus hernia , heartburn , ibs and indigestion that i can pinpoint as starting when i first started wearing underwired bras			1
' i have indents from the straps that have even affected how my clavicle bone ‘ sticks up ’			0
’ @entity55 was also told that her back had been flattened by her bra because the muscles down the front of her body and legs had shortened as her chest pulled her forward			1
@entity55 , who practised pilates and @entity94 to in a bid to remedy her problems , also suffered from tension headaches and neck pain , tendonitis in her shoulders and elbows and pins and needles			2
@entity104 , a consultant osteopath and sports massage therapist in @entity106 , said : ‘ on many occasions i have been able to link women ’s back and neck complaints directly to badly - fitted bras that not only offer limited or no support but creating visible problems in posture , resulting in pain and tension			1
@entity116 can affect posture , which often leads to back pain and even indigestion			1
straps that are too tight can also trap nerves and cause headaches ‘ traditional bras are often too tight around the ribs , creating a pivot point in the middle of the back , dividing it into two smaller areas that ca n’t work as effectively			0
‘ the lack of support at the front can also bring the upper back forward and to compensate for this , many women end up tilting their heads backwards			2
@entity135 @entity136 @entity137 ‘ all these slight but continuous maladjustments put unnecessary pressure on the diaphragm , which if you are sitting at a desk for hours each day , affect the breathing mechanism and can also be a direct link to digestion problems and @entity70 ( @entity70 )			2
‘ @entity147 tight straps not only cause skin irritations but reduce blood flow , affecting the nerves and contribute to tension headaches			0
’ @entity55 ’s problems have now disappeared after she was properly fitted with a new bra called @entity154			1
she said it has even helped her breathe more easily			0
designed by @entity162 bra fitter @entity158 and consultant plastic surgeon @entity160 , the bra is fitted ' three - dimensionally '			2
conventional bra fittings involve two measurements : one around the ribcage under the bust , and another around the fullest part of the breasts			0
but @entity154 is based on three measurements taken with a patented elastic strap using colour , letter and number combinations to define frame , depth and volume			0
product developer mr @entity160 said that well - fitted bra could negate the need for breast - reduction surgery : ' many women present to surgeons with back and shoulder pain , even sores or welts from straps and underwires digging into their skin			1
' they blame the size of their breasts and wish for a surgical reduction			0
' but in almost all of the cases i see , the problems stem from not having the right support which has , over time , led to very negative posture that is creating huge discomfort			0
' @entity199 said that she had recommended the new bra to some of her patients too			0
‘ one of my patients is in her seventies , suffers from arthritis and we have been working on the curvature in her spine			0
' after discovering @entity154 , i recommended she get measured and fitted and even i was astonished at the difference			0
' by simply changing her bra , her spine straightened by a quarter of an inch , which may not sound like a lot , but in anatomical terms it is very impressive			0
‘ by wearing something that does the right job , the posture improves because the muscles are working in a different yet correct way and it enables and encourages you to stand properly			2

estimated that up to *80* *%* of women wear a bra that does *n't* fit them properly
an ill - fitting bra can trigger seemingly unrelated conditions because it can irritate skin and affect posture - which in turn affects internal organs
@entity55 , 62 , suffered a hiatus hernia and heartburn because she wore a poorly - fitted , underwired bra
a well - fitted bra can *prevent* breast - reduction surgery , say doctors
