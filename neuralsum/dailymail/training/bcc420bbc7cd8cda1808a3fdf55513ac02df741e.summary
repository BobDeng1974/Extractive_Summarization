a review of @entity2 ’s record on human rights was branded ‘ ludicrous ’ last night – for including criticisms from the governments of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
the @entity10 report also contains scathing assessments of the @entity2 from other countries notorious for their wholesale denial of human rights – among them @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17			1

@entity42 members are permitted to contribute to the report , which is published on every member state every four years			0
critics said the @entity10 was undermining its credibility by allowing nations with serious human rights violations to hijack the process			1
@entity50 , @entity51 mp for @entity52 and @entity53 , said : ‘ this is actually so ridiculous it ’s laughable			0
it is like being lectured by @entity57 on the peaceful co-existence of nations			0
all we need now is @entity60 to criticise us on our human rights record and the joke would be complete			2
‘ the @entity10 should be a serious organisation and comments like this damage its credibility both in this country and around the world			0
’ as part of the review process a delegation including @entity2 minister @entity69 and more than 20 officials went to @entity73 last month			0
he had to endure more than an hour of questioning by delegates from other states on this country ’s human rights record			1
in public comments he was diplomatic , saying this country was ‘ proud of its human rights record ’ but admitting there was ‘ room for improvement ’			1
among the countries which compiled the draft report was @entity86 , which has faced criticism from @entity88 over its treatment of political prisoners			0
it also included criticism from @entity93 and @entity17 , on wage differences between men and women in the @entity2			0

@entity7 is accused of allowing widespread torture by police and security officials and extra-judicial killings			2
human rights observers criticised the conditions in which elections were held there in march , with severe restrictions on opponents of president mr @entity21			1

write caption here the @entity15 delegate – from a country where the security services are held responsible for ‘ disappearances ’ and arbitrary execution – said the government here ‘ should be more proactive in promoting multiculturalism ’			0
@entity6 , a country which allows execution by stoning and where political dissidents are routinely tortured , called on the @entity2 to better protect religious minorities			0
bizarrely , @entity152 asked that @entity2 ‘ fully recognise the human right to safe drinking ’			2
the @entity10 ’s website states that the review process ‘ provides the opportunity for each state to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries			1
