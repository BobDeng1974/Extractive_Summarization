public opinion against the @entity1 has topped discontent seen during even the darkest days of the @entity3			1
almost 12 years into the conflict , 67 per cent of @entity4 responding to a recent poll agree that the war in @entity8 has n’t been worth fighting			2
only 28 per cent of @entity4 believe the war was worth fighting , but an unexpected 53 per cent are against removing all troops from the country			0
in short , acrimony towards the @entity1 now exceeds the most negative opinions seen against the @entity3 in 2007 , during which almost 1,000 @entity4 soldiers died carrying out @entity3			1
@entity4 tiring of @entity8 : soldiers carrying the remains of sgt. @entity18 , who was killed july 23 when his unit was attacked with an improvised explosive device in @entity8 the two - thirds against the war based their beliefs on examining cost versus benefit , according to the @entity28 / @entity27 poll			2
this sentiment tops the record 66 per cent of people polled by @entity28 / @entity27 to be against the @entity3 in april 2007			0
also , unlike in @entity33 , the @entity4 received overwhelming support invading @entity8 from countries around the world , which stood in stark contrast to the opposition voiced against the @entity4 assault on @entity33 led by @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity42 , the latter of which called the military action ' illegal ' at the time			1
despite only 28 per cent of @entity4 responding to the poll believing that the war was worth fighting , a surprising 53 per cent are in favor of not removing all troops from @entity8 , instead supporting the idea that some stay behind to train @entity8 forces after the planned 2014 troop exodus			1
with only 43 per cent of respondents believing the @entity1 has contributed to the long - term security of the @entity4 , sentiment against the conflict is spread across most demographics			2
it is worth noting , though , that almost 60 per cent of @entity4 polled in june believed the war did contribute to the long - term security of the @entity4 – one month after @entity60 killed @entity61 in @entity62			0
weary : americans are have grown increasingly tired of @entity4 troops being involved in @entity8 essentially split on the issue , 51 per cent of @entity66 believe the war is n’t worth fighting , according to the poll			1
an overwhelming 74 per cent of @entity71 and 71 pe rcent of independents are also against the war			0
the @entity4 has seen the deaths of over 2,100 troops since the beginning of the @entity77 in 2001 , according to military records			0
by comparison , over 4,400 @entity4 soldiers have died since the beginning of the @entity3 .			0

sentiment against the @entity1 tops that against the @entity3 despite @entity8 seeing less than half the @entity4 troop deaths as @entity33
a surprising *majority* of @entity4 still want to keep troops in @entity8 to train local forces
