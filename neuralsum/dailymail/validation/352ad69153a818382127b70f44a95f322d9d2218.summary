the national lead officer for football policing has questioned the scheduling of @entity5 's @entity4 quarter - final against @entity6 on saturday after the match was marred by crowd disturbances			1
@entity5 fans invaded the pitch on two occasions while seats were torn out and thrown from the @entity13 which was housing the @entity6 fans			1
the @entity15 is launching an investigation while @entity17 made 17 arrests related to the game and are also seeking witnesses to a disturbance at the @entity23 pub before the game , which kicked off at 5.30pm			1
police clash with unruly fans in the aftermath of the @entity4 clash between @entity5 and @entity6 the national lead officer for football policing has questioned the scheduling of the match on saturday night four of those arrests were for drunk and disorderly behaviour and @entity34 from @entity35 believes more consideration should be taken over the scheduling of potentially heated fixtures			1
' saturday night football is here to stay , we appreciate that , friday night football is due to be coming in , ' he told @entity42			0
' when you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play			0
all games have potential ( for crowd trouble ) but clearly some games have more potential than others			0
@entity5 fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2 - 0 victory over @entity6 at @entity52 police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after @entity5 booked their place in the semi-finals ' they are big clubs , not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture , late on a weekend in particular , alcohol is a factor			1
' if you give people four , five , six hours more drinking time , do n't be surprised if in a highly - charged atmosphere , their behaviour is n't good			2
' if you 're looking at whether alcohol was a factor , there was disorder at a public house near the ground before the game , people being arrested coming into the ground for being drunk and disorderly , being drunk seeking entry to a football ground			0
' if you looked at the people who came onto the pitch , a few of them looked like they were worse for wear from some substance and i do n't think there is any coincidence that where there 's alcohol involved , people 's behaviour tends to deteriorate			2
' villa fans leap over hoardings at full - time , and the decision to play the game at 5.30pm is being questioned @entity6 goalkeeper @entity102 is mocked by an @entity5 fan following the home side 's second goal he added : ' i do think there is an issue here for the broadcasters because that game was scheduled for a 5.30 kick - off to meet the @entity42 's scheduling			1
' broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously			0
' what we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately			0
if you look at the four games for the @entity4 quarter - finals this week , you could n't probably have picked a worse one to have on a saturday tea - time than a local derby between two big clubs			1
' the @entity6 goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full - time whistle scorer @entity129 ( second left ) is mobbed by a fan and team - mates @entity132 and @entity133 @entity5 issued an apology for their fans ' behaviour while @entity6 vowed to take a ' zero tolerance ' approach after promising to co-operate fully with the @entity15 inquiry			1
and @entity6 boss @entity140 has called for a lifetime ban for any of the club 's fans who were found to be responsible for throwing seats			2
' if that was the situation , and they 've got cctv cameras up there , those supporters should never come into another football ground			0
it is like people coming into someone else 's house - you have to show respect			0
' @entity6 forward @entity156 is escorted off the field after a row with an @entity5 fan the pitch at @entity52 can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass @entity140 was also concerned about the ease with which spectators were able to get on to the pitch			1
he added : ' i am old enough to have seen isolated incidents happen like that			0
i do n't want to have a go and take anything away from what happened on the pitch and what happened in the game			0
' if one thing , @entity5 should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night , 5.30pm , you need to police it properly , and i am sure @entity5 will look at it			2
