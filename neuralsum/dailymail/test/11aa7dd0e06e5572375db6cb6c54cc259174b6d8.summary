not every @entity1 island lets you rent a boat and potter about at will , but @entity5 does			1
it 's the difference between a good holiday and an adventurously good holiday - with some embarrassment thrown in			2
on day one , after manoeuvring our rented boat into sheltered waters off @entity15 beach , i cut the throttle and my girlfriend threw out the anchor			2
splash ! splendidly small : @entity5 has a relaxed , offbeat vibe that plays out in the pretty port of @entity21 as the breeze pushed us back , the short anchor line quickly ran out until the end - then we heard a softer , more ominous splash			1
we had n't noticed that the end was n't secured			2
but our shame was admirably handled by the boat owners , who promptly gave us a second anchor , and assured us they would retrieve the original			2
this generosity of spirit set the tone for our week on this hilly , pine - forested island			1
@entity5 is known as the film location for @entity38 ! and i had feared there might be endless reminders of the day when @entity43 's @entity42 found love			1
i need not have worried			0
the island lies in the @entity46 , east of the mainland			2
with no airport , most people fly to @entity50 , followed by an hour 's ferry ride			1
arriving in @entity5 is special			1
seal of approval : @entity53 encountered two locals of the bewhiskered variety while sailing around @entity56 it has one of the most scenic ports in @entity1			1
wooded hillsides are punctuated with white walls topped by terracotta - tiled roofs			0
a ruined @entity64 fortress and dozens of chapels make you feel that this is a spiritual retreat			0
many of the chapels were built by families as status symbols and are owned and maintained by their descendants , rather than by the @entity72			0
we opted for a villa			0
up a steep hill from @entity5 town , and along a dirt track ( vehicle needed ) lies @entity79 , with its cool stone floors , pool and large terrace			1
in the evenings , the lights from town twinkle and moonlight shimmers on the water			0
@entity88 operates out of sheltered @entity90 beach on the west coast , a 20 - minute drive from @entity5 town			1
with guidance from mr @entity95 himself , the coastline was ours to explore in a 30hp motorboat			0
one day , we headed north , anchoring at the pine - fringed @entity99 beach , which we had to ourselves , as it is only accessible by boat			0
the adjacent islet of @entity105 comprises little more than rocks jutting out of the blue sea , but our appetite for maritime adventures was well rewarded here			0
watching the whiskered faces of two monk seals rolling lazily in the sea was unforgettable			0
these shy , endangered marine mammals - once widespread around the @entity116 and beyond - are now limited to small ranges , one of which is close to @entity5			1
@entity118 is a smaller town in the north , and its white - washed houses are as authentic as you might wish , with few compromises to mass tourism			0
we spent an enjoyable evening here before reaching one of the stars of the island , @entity131 , a restaurant perched high on a hilltop			2
owner @entity134 offers visitors fine traditional seafood as well as slow - cooked pork , and the terrace has some of the most spectacular views on the island			1
we were tempted to exclaim : ' mamma mia ! ' instead , we wondered how quickly we could return to this gorgeous island			2
it wo n't be soon enough			0
