astronomers have witnessed the creation of a multiple star system for the first time , which may one day resemble the solar system of @entity6 's home planet , @entity7 , in the film @entity8			1
incredible images taken from a series of telescopes on @entity12 show clouds of gas in the process of developing into stars			1
the pictures are providing new insight into how systems with more than one star , and even our own solar system , are formed			0
astronomers have witnessed the creation of a multiple star system for the first time			1
this close - up image , taken using a series of telescopes on @entity12 , focuses on the region forming the stars a team of international scientists , including researchers from the @entity32 and @entity34 @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , looked at a cloud of gas approximately 800 light - years from @entity12			1
they focused on a core of gas that contains one young protostar and three dense pockets of matter that they say will collapse into stars over the next 40,000 years			0
of the eventual four stars , the astronomers predict that three may become a stable triple - star system , according to the study published in the journal @entity51			1
the amazing images show clouds of gas in the process of developing into stars			1
this is a large scale @entity57 image of the dust in the region in blue , with the dense gas low - resolution image in green , and the dense gas high - resolution image displaying filaments in red seeing a multiple star system in its early stages of formation has been a longstanding challenge			1
astronomers used a combination of the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) and the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) to make it possible , at last , to look at such a young system			0
they also used the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) , in @entity76 , to study a dense core of gas called @entity79 5 ( @entity80 ) in a region where young stars are forming in the constellation @entity84			0
‘ these kind of multi-star systems are quite common in the universe , ’ said professor @entity85 , of the @entity86 at the @entity32			0
' think of @entity7 in @entity8 , where there are two ' suns ' in the sky			2
that is n’t too far away from something that could be a real formation			0
‘ in fact nearly half of all stars are in this type of system			0
’ he explained that seeing a multiple star system in its early stages of formation has been a longstanding challenge , but the combination of the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) and the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) has made it possible at last to look at such a young system			1
dr @entity107 , of the @entity108 at @entity33 , performed the stability analysis calculations on the system			0
he said : ‘ observing the formation and subsequent destruction of these systems will ultimately help us to understand whether our own sun was once part of such a system and if it was , what happened to its stellar siblings			2
’ of the eventual four stars , the astronomers predict that three may become a stable triple - star system			1
an artist 's impression on the left shows the star and three dense gas condensations system , while the right panel shows the system after the stars are formed out of the condensations			2
the scientists used the @entity71 and @entity72 , along with the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) in @entity76 , to study a dense core of gas called @entity79 5 ( @entity80 ) in a region where young stars are forming in the constellation @entity84			0
this object was known to contain one young forming star			0
when the research team used the @entity71 to map radio emission from ammonia molecules , they discovered that filaments of gas in @entity147 are fragmenting , and the fragments are beginning to contract to form additional stars - ultimately becoming a multiple - star system			1
project leader @entity151 , of the @entity152 , @entity153 , in @entity154 , said : ‘ we know that these stars eventually will form a multi-star system because our observations show that these gas condensations are gravitationally bound			1
‘ this is the first time we 've been able to show that such a young system is gravitationally bound			2
‘ this provides fantastic evidence that fragmentation of gas filaments is a process that can produce multiple - star systems			1
’ ‘ multi-star systems are quite common in the universe , ’ said professor @entity85 , of the @entity86 at the @entity32			0
' think of @entity7 in @entity8 , where there are two “ suns ” in the sky [ pictured ]			2
that is n’t too far away from something that could be a real formation ' the pictures are providing new insight into how systems with more than one star , and even our own solar system , are formed			0
a simulation of the creation of the multi-star system is shown astronomers have previously said that mechanisms responsible for creating multiple star systems , include fragmentation of the main gas core of the star , fragmentation within a disk of material orbiting a young star and gravitational capture by one star of another			1
‘ we 've now convincingly added fragmentation of gas filaments to this list , ’ dr @entity151 added			0
the condensations in @entity147 that will produce stars now range from one - tenth to more than one - third the mass of our sun , the scientists said			2
their separations will range from 3,000 to 11,000 times the @entity12 - sun distance			2
the astronomers analysed the dynamics of the gas condensations and predict that when they form into stars , they will form a stable system of an inner binary			1
they predict that the other two stars will be ejected from the system .			0

astronomers captured creation of a multiple star system for the first time
they viewed the process from a series of telescopes on @entity12
images show clouds of gas in the process of developing into stars
*experts* predict three may become a stable triple - star system
@entity6 's home planet of @entity7 , in @entity8 , is part of a *fictional* multi-star system , so he could see more then one sun in the sky
