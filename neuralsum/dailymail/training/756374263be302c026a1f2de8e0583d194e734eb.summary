' let 's be realistic			2
we 've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games			2
we had very difficult games against @entity40			0
i do n't know a scapegoat for what ? ' what is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game			0
you have to accept that football is played by human beings who have ups and downs like you have in your life			0
' it has been suggested that the formation @entity4 are currently playing , with @entity2 often playing out on the right , does not suit the @entity17 's talents			1
but @entity0 believes that is merely a side issue			1
' that 's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants , ' he added			2
if you look at the heat map where he plays , you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch			2
' here then , are @entity2 's heat maps from his last four @entity4 games : @entity2 's heat map during @entity4 's 2 - 0 @entity6 defeat away at @entity5 on tuesday @entity2 's heat map during @entity4 's 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity78 in the @entity79 on september 13 @entity2 's heat map during @entity4 's 1 - 1 draw at at @entity81 on august 31 , in which he covered more ground @entity2 's heat map during @entity4 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity85 on august 23 , where he played more on the left for all the heat maps and other statistics from all @entity79 and @entity6 matches click here they show that @entity2 's involvement was minimal in the defeat in @entity5 and he was stuck out on the left against @entity85			1
however , @entity0 was half right as @entity2 popped up more in the centre against @entity78 and particularly at @entity81			1
on the @entity5 debacle , @entity0 added : ' it ’s a bit unfair because i believe that our offensive talents on tuesday night [ against @entity5 ] were not in their best condition , and they could n’t express that talent			1
' on the other hand it ’s @entity106			0
he came back on august 11			2
you know it takes a few months for them to get back to their best , that can happen			2
' they should not be concerned and just support him			0
i understand that you want your best players always to make the difference in every single game and we all go through period where we are a bit less good			0
' a club is a union between players , supporters and directors			0
you have to be united and sometimes go through periods together where it goes a bit less well			0
' @entity0 revealed that @entity128 will undergo an exploratory operation on his ankle injury this evening which will determine how long he is out for			1
if he does not need further surgery , it will be six weeks before his return , but if he needs to go under the knife it will rule him out for at least three months			2
' we ’ll know tonight [ friday ]			0
