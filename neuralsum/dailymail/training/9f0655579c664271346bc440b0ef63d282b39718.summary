by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 14:31 est , 21 february 2013 @entity1 is at the centre of claims that he is n't eligible to play in the @entity4			0
the former @entity6 striker made his return in the competition in @entity10 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity11 last night			1
it was the first time he has played in the tournament since helping the @entity15 to victory in the final against @entity18 last may			0

@entity11 are now considering whether to appeal but did not go into detail over their specific grievance			0
a club statement read : ' there are doubts about the validity of the permission to play for @entity1 in the @entity4			0
@entity11 reserves its rights and is looking into this			0
' @entity1 signed for @entity10 earlier this year from @entity41 side @entity40 - just six months after quitting @entity6			1
he is on an 18 - month loan deal at the @entity44 giants and is bidding to guide them to @entity47 glory along with @entity49 ace @entity48			2
the controversy relates to the @entity52 's former club in @entity41 , @entity40 , challenging @entity1 's move to @entity10			1
shenhua officials previously claimed the @entity4 winner remains under contract with them and it seems that @entity11 are willing to test that argument with @entity58			2
@entity40 , who he joined from @entity6 last summer , issued a statement on their website earlier this month describing themselves as ' deeply shocked ' by the announcement , and insisting @entity1 remains under contract in @entity41			1
' we understand that @entity1 is eager to participate in the @entity4 , ' the statement read			0
' @entity67 and @entity1 on july 1 , 2012 officially signed a formal contract for a period of two and a half years			1
the club has acted in accordance with this contract , and has effectively fulfilled the responsibilities and obligations of the club			2
in the thick of it : @entity1 challenges @entity11 goalkeeper @entity77 on wednesday night ' @entity1 is still a player of @entity67 , the contract between the two parties is still within the period of validity			1
' @entity40 is prepared to collate all the evidence and information and submit it to @entity84 in order to protect its interests			1
' @entity1 , speaking through his representatives @entity89 on @entity90 , said at the time of his signing for the @entity44 giants : ' the opportunity to play for this great club was an offer that i could not turn down			0
' i am looking forward to playing in the @entity4 again , against the best clubs in @entity58			0
' @entity58 rules stipulate that players must be registered with their club by february 1 , if they are to feature in the knockout stages of the @entity4			2
@entity11 sports director @entity103 and finance chief @entity104 confirmed they would appeal			0
' it would be negligent not to have it checked , ' @entity103 said			0
@entity104 said : ' there is the suspicion that he received his eligibility after the end of the deadline to register the player for the @entity4			0
' before each game @entity58 states that every club has to take responsibility for the players used			0
it is now up to @entity58 to decide and @entity11 will respect this process			0
' @entity120 ' strike in the last minute of the first half gave @entity11 a slight advantage in @entity22			1
@entity120 calmly slotted home after @entity124 had squared the ball to him to give the @entity29 side a vital draw at the @entity128 , although @entity11 's goalscorer will miss the second leg after picking up a booking			1
@entity132 and tumble : @entity1 ( right ) wrestles with @entity11 defender @entity134 at the @entity136 stadium @entity137 had earlier put @entity10 in front with a piece of individual brilliance but they could not extend their lead in a breathtaking first - half in which both teams failed to convert several glorious opportunities			1
the second half was less open , although @entity137 nearly gave the hosts a slender lead heading into the second leg but could only fire wide of the target			0
@entity1 and @entity48 both made their returns to the @entity4 after completing recent moves to @entity10 from @entity40 and @entity152 respectively			1
but it was @entity137 who produced a moment of magic worthy of either of the pair when he broke the deadlock in sparkling fashion			2
the forward collected the ball from @entity162 on the edge of the area before flicking over @entity11 defender @entity134 with his heel and wonderfully firing into the roof of the net in the 12th minute			0
it was a sickening blow for the visitors , who had seen @entity10 keeper @entity171 make fine saves from both @entity120 and @entity173 in the opening minute			2
@entity175 : the former @entity6 ace showboats during last night 's 1 - 1 draw nevertheless they nearly levelled almost immediately after @entity137 's brilliance , but @entity173 just failed to connect with @entity134 ' flick - on from @entity124 's corner			1
and in an increasingly open first half , they were nearly made to pay when @entity134 fired against the bar with the goal gaping after @entity1 had seen his left - footed strike fingertipped away by @entity11 goalkeeper @entity77			2
it was the @entity29 side who nearly scored next though , with @entity189 deflecting @entity124 's cutback wide of his own post , while the influential @entity11 striker struck over on the turn despite being given plenty of space in the area			1
both sides seemed to view attack as the best form of defence and @entity1 , who was making a nuisance of himself in @entity11 's backline , played in @entity204 but he could not lift his effort over @entity77			0
row : @entity1 's former club @entity40 say he broke his contract to join @entity10 yet @entity11 drew level on the stroke of half - time courtesy of @entity212 midfielder @entity120 , who will miss the second leg after picking up a booking for dissent			1
@entity124 burst through on goal after @entity10 had given the ball away in midfield and squared for the free @entity120 and he calmly struck past @entity171			2
it was a far more subdued affair after the interval although @entity11 did have a decent penalty appeal turned down when @entity124 's fierce strike looked to have cannoned off @entity224 's hands , which were raised to his chest			0
it was not until late on that the game sprang back into life , with @entity137 shooting across the face of goal from @entity1 's inch - perfect flick - on while @entity224 's half - volley from the edge of the area was tipped over by @entity77			2
and @entity10 's efforts to push for a winner nearly backfired completely when , at the other end , @entity237 dribbled to the edge of their box unchecked before shooting inches wide of @entity171 's right - hand post .			1

@entity29 poised to challenge legality of striker 's move from @entity41 to @entity246
*ex-club* @entity40 insist he broke contract to sign for @entity10
