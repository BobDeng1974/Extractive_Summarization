by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 players and managers in the @entity4 will be told the doctor ’s decision must be final as part of a new directive designed to protect players from head injuries			1
new rules are being introduced this season after high - profile concussions involving @entity15 goalkeeper @entity14 and @entity17 striker @entity16 and a series of incidents at the @entity20			1
clear guidelines will be brought in for the @entity4 campaign starting on saturday week which will state that the doctor ’s decision is paramount when it comes to deciding whether or not a player can continue			1
new rule : the @entity4 will introduce a tunnel doctor to oversee any head collisions right decision ? @entity14 clashed with @entity16 last season but finished the match against @entity17 dangerous : the @entity15 medical staff came under criticism for allowing @entity14 to continue under new guidelines to deal with head injuries , even if there is no loss of consciousness then an assessment should take place on the pitch or the touchline to judge whether there is a risk of concussion			1
it follows a number of incidents last season , including at the @entity20 , where players continued despite appearing to have been concussed			2
the new guidelines state : ' if there has been a confirmed or suspected period of loss of consciousness , the player must be removed from the field of play , and not be allowed to return			2
speaking out : the @entity58 have campaigned for change to the rules across sports the @entity58 has led the way in urging the governing bodies of all sports , but especially football and rugby , to properly concussion			2
since launching the campaign last september support has grown with everyone from politicians to stars across the pond agreeing the issue needs to be addressed			0
our efforts have seen calls for a cross-party parliamentary inquiry in to the issue			0
in november the @entity80 announced that they will consider mandatory concussion training for all players and will review the controversial pitch - side concussion assessment protocol			1
and now football , too , has taken steps to properly protect players from what is a dangerous occurrence in sport			0
one that , if not addressed properly , can lead to serious long - term problems			0
for more information on our campaign visit : @entity94 ' if there is any doubt as to the course of events , elucidation may be sought from officials or other players			0
in the event that there is video replay available pitch - side or in the players ' tunnel , this could be used to clarify the course of events			1
' where no loss of consciousness is apparent an on - field or touchline assessment will take place			0
' there must also be an additional ' tunnel doctor ' present at all @entity4 games , who can study video replays and help the club doctors assess potential concussion injuries with information which may have been missed by the medical team on the touchline			1
a concussion recognition tool - kit will be supplied warning of the symptoms to look for and how to respond			1
this will be supplied to all clubs and carried by all medical practitioners , and will advise that players must come off , even if concussion is only ' suspected '			1
players will also be submitted to baseline cognitive assessment in pre-season to help doctors manage their recovery after a head injury			1
the @entity4 will also remind all clubs to comply with the @entity140 - approved guidelines issued by the concussion in @entity142 ( @entity143 ) in @entity144 in 2012 , stating that athletes in all sports should not return to action for a minimum of six to seven days			1
it is in conjunction with a poster campaign to raise awareness of concussion in football , which will be promoted through the @entity155 and into the grassroots of the game by the @entity158			0
injury : @entity161 's @entity160 ( centre ) gets hit in the face by @entity164 during the @entity20 final off : the @entity161 youngster played on after the collision but was eventually substituted @entity169 players @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 appear in a video to publicise the key messages , such as ' do n’t be a hero ' , ' listen to the medics ' and ' get off the pitch '			1
leading brain injury charity headway has welcomed the changes			0
' the measures are a significant step forward in the protection of footballers at all levels and therefore are warmly welcomed , ' said chief executive @entity186			0
' the more we know about head and brain injury , the better we understand the risks of continuing to play competitive sport following a concussion			1
the guidelines at all levels , from @entity140 to the @entity158 and @entity4 , have to date been insufficient and ineffective , as demonstrated by numerous high - profile examples			1
' it is vital that decisions regarding a player ’s suitability to return to the field of play are made by independent doctors , with measures put in place to protect them against pressure from club staff or the players themselves			2
' these are the changes brought in to help football ’s medics after the findings from a working group established during last season after the @entity14 and @entity16 incidents , and chaired by @entity169 doctor @entity217			2
@entity15 keeper @entity14 was knocked unconscious in a clash with @entity16 in november but ignored medical advice and insisted on returning to the pitch to continue			0
groggy : @entity16 was knocked out in the action of scoring for @entity17 against @entity224 last season keep going : the @entity226 forward briefly received treatment before playing on in the @entity4 clash manager @entity229 backed his player rather than his doctor - which he will not be able to do under the new rules – but subsequent tests ruled @entity14 out of the next two @entity15 games			1
the goalkeeper did not play again for 12 days			0
' there are worldwide guidelines but people in football are unaware , ' said @entity242 doctor @entity241 , the chair of the @entity4 doctors ’ group			2
' it is a relatively uncommon injury in football and the science of concussion is very poorly understood			2
' we must stop this feeling that it ’s a brave or heroic decision to stay on and that ’s it ’s an injury you can run off			2
the doctor ’s decision must be final			2
' @entity15 doctor @entity253 was part of the working group , as were experts like @entity257 , head of sports medicine at the @entity80 , @entity260 , horseracing ’s chief medical officer , and neurosurgeon @entity263			0
collision : @entity265 kicks the ball as @entity267 tries a header during the @entity20 down : the @entity270 star stumbled to the ground after the sickening collision earlier in the season , @entity16 had been knocked out while scoring for @entity17 at @entity224 and confessed he could not remember anything about the goal			0
still , he was allowed to play on , as was @entity277 ’s @entity276 in a game against @entity279			0
the exposure of these incidents convinced those in football that something had to be done and their instinct seemed to be confirmed when @entity288 ’s @entity287 and @entity270 ’s @entity267 both continued to play after being knocked briefly unconscious during @entity20 games			0
some changes were made to @entity4 protocol after @entity292 fractured his skull playing for @entity294 against @entity295 in 2006 , making it compulsory to have a doctor on the bench and making sure an ambulance was on stand - by at the ground for players			1
these changes were credited with helping to keep @entity303 alive after his heart attack playing for @entity305 at @entity15 in 2012			0
worrying scenes : @entity288 players gather around @entity308 after he is knocked out saying no : @entity308 refuses to leave the field after coming round following his collision			0
