by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:51 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 05:20 est , 24 september 2012 @entity2 today launched a passionate – if not entirely complimentary – defence of @entity5 as the deputy prime minister was again forced to defend his leadership			1
mr @entity2 , the @entity8 london mayor , set out 20 reasons why everyone , and not just conservatives , should be grateful that mr @entity5 ‘ laid down his political life ’ to form a government , even if that meant being attacked from all sides and suffering a ‘ protracted political humiliation ’			1
@entity17 about his leadership and dreadful poll ratings , mr @entity5 will be grateful of praise coming from any quarter			0
@entity2 said @entity5 is ' probably a natural @entity8 ' as he set out why the @entity21 must survive as leader ‘ it is time for us @entity5 fans to echo those kindly folk who are trying to save the sweet furry badgers from the wrath of farmers , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
‘ never mind the badgers – save the @entity31 from extermination ! ’ but the support of one of the country ’s best known conservatives will not be universally welcomed by @entity21 activists			2
at one point mr @entity2 says mr @entity5 ‘ probably a natural @entity8 ’ aside from his views on @entity40			1
and in a backhanded compliment he delights in the ‘ utterly hopeless ’ @entity21 campaigns for a new voting system and an elected @entity44 which helped preserve the status quo			2
opinion polls carried out to make the start of this week ’s @entity21 conference made grim reading for mr @entity5			1
@entity2 compared @entity5 's plight to the government 's looming badger cull : ¿ never mind the badgers ¿ save the @entity31 from extermination ! ¿ in one his net satisfaction ratings had dropped to -63 , a new low			2
in a survey of party members for the @entity61 website , his approval rating had dropped into negative territory for the first time , down to minus two points			0
four in five @entity21 members also fear being in coalition will be bad for the party 's election prospects in 2015			2
but mr @entity2 insist that without mr @entity5 ’s bold decision to form a coalition , @entity69 would still be in power , and @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 would not have been able to embark on major economic , welfare and education reforms			0
he also hails mr @entity5 as ‘ a very nice chap indeed ’ who is ‘ very good at tennis ’ , though keeps losing to @entity81			0
‘ his wife , @entity83 , is every bit as lovely and clever and funny as she appears , ’ mr @entity2 wrote in @entity82			0
‘ i have always thought that if you leave out @entity40 , he is probably a natural @entity8			1
‘ he is certainly tough , and can take a joke			0
’ whether mr @entity5 can see the funny side to being lauded by mr @entity2 remains to be seen .			0

@entity2 says @entity21 leader is ' probably a natural @entity8 '
the list of 20 ' compliments ' will not all make for easy reading for the deputy *pm*
