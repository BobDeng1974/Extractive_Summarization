the artist set her camera on a timer to take a photograph every seven seconds and posed as if she ' wanted to look like someone else '			0
the resulting video , entitled ' manipulated ' , plays in a non-stop loop for over a minute and sees her proportions morphing into different shapes , often cartoon , highlighting the constantly changing beauty ideals that women face			2
bigger boobs , smaller waist : @entity55 student @entity7 made her body pliable by using photoshop to show what she 'd look like with different proportions the student artist browsed through hundreds of images of what might be considered beautiful and even changed the proportions of her eyes , seen as normal , left , and much bigger , right @entity7 , who graduates in may , says that after spending ' countless hours ' browsing magazines for body trends , she combined ' 126 digitally manipulated photos that create the illusion that i am molding my body like modeling clay			1
' she told entertainment and lifestyle website @entity72 : ' being a young woman , i have had many battles with this idea of beauty			0

this time @entity7 experiments with a nipped - in waist and small breasts			1
the artist took a different image every seven seconds to capture the video fantasy proportions : with big eyes and large breasts in one shot ( left ) ... @entity7 then slims down her frame to be much more slender ( right ) ' but as soon as i start scrolling through the @entity96 , my mind is flooded with images of this impossible , " ideal " beauty			1
' she goes on to explain that ' the video goes through several stages of “ beauty ” as i receive conflicting opinions on what true beauty is			2
as i go back and forth , i end on my natural body and the video starts over			2
' the aim of the project , which has garnered an art award , she adds , is to illustrate ' the effects media and public opinions have on the way we look at ourselves			0
' ' i have chosen to use myself in this short to show my own inner conflict with beauty as i battle with the desire to look like someone else and the acceptance of my natural beauty			0
' the artist described the project as ' therapeutic ' and said that it helped her to realise that her flaws are what make her human			0
