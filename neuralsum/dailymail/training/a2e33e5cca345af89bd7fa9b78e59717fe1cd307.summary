by @entity0 mail on sunday columnist @entity0 returns to give us his views from a week of cricket			1
he discusses the ' run - out ' of @entity6 at @entity7 and comparing it to not walking , why there is no logic behind it , how exciting it is to have three debutants , his own fitness , and how their @entity15 humiliation is being put behind them			1
i think anyone trying to compare the ‘ @entity19 ’ run - out of @entity6 at @entity7 this week with not walking is very naive			1
some people have tried , no doubt with what happened with myself in the ashes at @entity25 last summer in mind			2
but there ’s no comparison			0
i ’ve never played a game at any level , including schools cricket , where i ’ve seen a batsman run outat the non-striker ’s end			1
that ’s why i think it is completely wrong and anyone who compares it to not walking is being naive			1
do n't compare the run - out of @entity6 ( left ) at the odi match between @entity40 and @entity41 to not walking			1
@entity42 ( right ) appeals for the wicket of @entity6 during the fifth odi between @entity40 and @entity41 @entity6 leaves the field after controversially being run out at the @entity39 in @entity47 why ? because i ’ve only ever played with one consistent walker and that was @entity50			1
not walking is the norm — you wait for the umpire ’s decision			1
there ’s a vast difference with ‘ @entity58 ’			0
it ’s not the norm			0
i was actually surprised @entity61 , as @entity41 ’s captain , upheld the appeal			0
but i think the major problem is it should n’t even be in the players ’ hands			0
this goes above pointing at players or captains			0
leave it up to the umpires			0
it should n’t be an option to have a dismissal like that because at the end of the day if you ’re a supporter you ’ve not seen a ball bowled , you ’ve not seen a shot played but you ’ve lost a world - class batsman			1
i ca n’t see any logic behind that being a mode of dismissal			1
it seems a really strange rule that someone can be run out like that because you ’re getting no entertainment from it as a fan			1
i was n’t in the one - day squad so i actually watched the incident in the @entity95 changing room during ourgame at @entity97 and everyone was pretty surprised			1
the one consistent walker i ever played with was @entity50			0
not walking is the norm			2
as i said earlier , i think it should be in the umpires ’ hands			0
@entity41 said @entity106 was stealing runs at @entity108 and he had a warning at @entity7 , so the decision should n’t be up to the player to take the stumps , that should be the umpire saying : ‘ look , we ’ve gone upstairs , you ’re stealing a few toomany yards , if you do it again we ’ll take five off your score or we ’ll take 10 off your score			1
’ that would stop people doing it			0
we are all excited about starting the test series this week			0
regardless of what happened at @entity7 , we wo n’t need any extra motivation as we ’re kicking off a new era in the first test of the summer at @entity108			1
we ’re going to have three debutants who will be buzzing and @entity132 ’s tests always bring out a huge amount of excitement			2
so i ca n’t imagine it will add any extra spice because i expect there to be plenty of spice anyway			0
you ’ve got the honour and pride of playing for your country at @entity108			0
we have a lot to prove after what happened over the winter			0
and with the new players coming into a much - changed side , we know we have to gel quickly			2
fans might not know some of the new guys and i ’ve only met @entity151 for about 30 seconds in my life , so it will be very important we get to know our team - mates as well and as quickly as possible			1
@entity155 and @entity156 have shown they have got what it takes in international white - ball cricket and @entity161 pedigree proves he is a fantastic cricketer , too			2
they just have to believe what they have done to get selected in the first place means they belong at this level			0
i 've only met @entity151 for about 30 seconds in my life , so it will be very important we get to know each other @entity155 ( left ) and @entity156 ( right ) have shown they have got what it takes in international cricket my knee is doing fine , thank you ... it ’s great to be back in an @entity40 squad after missing the start of the summer with patella tendinitis			1
it flared up on harder surfaces in the winter but the knee was fine down at @entity97 last week so i ’m very confident it will not be a problem for the rest of the summer			1
it was always planned , even before the @entity15 , that i would probably not play in the one - day series against @entity41			1
i could have played but we decided i would miss it			0
the physio @entity191 , who is in his first year at @entity25 , has always been at the end of a phone and has been exceptional			0
when i ’m playing i have two physio sessions a week that will help strengthen the leg and it takespressure off the knee			2
i ’m having ice and compression after bowling , a lot of heat before bowling and massage through the quads to take the pressure off the knee			2
it is actually landing on my knee that brings inflammation so i ’m going to be wearing a knee pad to make the impact of falling on a small square slightly less			2
it might not do the job , it ’s just to try to take off some of the impact			0
i suppose it ’s a bit like what youuse in gardening , the knee pads an old bloke might use doing the flowerbeds			2
i just put it on and bowl in it , it took a little bit of getting used to but it helps diving in the field because fielding is an important part of international cricket so you ca n't hide			0
the knee was fine at @entity97 last week , thankfully			1
two physio sessions a week help strengthen the leg			0
... and we 're leaving the @entity15 defeat in the past - exactly where it belongs a lot has been said about last winter , especially what happened in @entity240			1
but the message we have got from @entity242 since he came in as coach is ‘ what ’s done is done , it ’s in the past			2
we do n’t want to look back ’			0
you obviously have to learn from what happened but we do n’t want to talk about the winter because it ’s about pushing this team forward now			0
i think having three debutants this week is a big statement because that ’s evidence we ’re looking to the future now			2
it is going to be crucial the senior players and management involved in that @entity15 series do n’t keep talking about it , because we ’ve got a big job to do this summer .			1

anyone comparing the ' @entity19 ' run - out of @entity6 at @entity7 with not walking is very naive , says @entity0
there **'s** no logic to that dismissal and it **'s** bad for the fans because they get no entertainment from being run out like that , he *explains*
@entity0 says it is great to have three debutants but thinks they have to get to know one another - and fast
his knee is doing fine , and @entity40 are leaving the @entity15 firmly in the past
