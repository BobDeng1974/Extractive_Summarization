by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 03:29 est , 10 may 2012 police have ruled out allegations that the @entity3 gave the parents of murdered schoolgirl @entity5 ‘ false hope ’ by deleting her voicemails			2
a five - month investigation found that while staff at the now - defunct tabloid did intercept some of @entity16 ’s messages , there was ‘ no evidence ’ to support claims that they then cynically erased them to make room for new ones to be left			1
a senior detective told the @entity23 yesterday that although there was still a question mark over two of @entity16 ’s messages which had apparently been wiped several weeks after her disappearance , they may well have been deleted automatically			1
anger : @entity29 and @entity30 , the parents of murdered @entity5 , give evidence at the @entity33 inquiry last november			1
mrs @entity30 said she did n't sleep for three nights after being told that @entity16 's phone had been hacked detective chief inspector @entity36 said the truth of exactly how they were erased will probably never be known			2
the incendiary allegation made in the @entity40 that journalists had deliberately deleted @entity16 ’s voicemails accelerated the closure of the @entity3 , and was a significant factor in prompting the @entity23 into press standards			1
it was also followed by a £ 3million compensation payment			2
@entity48 , which ran the @entity3 , paid the @entity49 £ 2million with @entity50 personally donating an additional £ 1million , which was split between six charities of their choice			2
@entity16 , 13 , vanished on march 21 , 2002 , while walking home in @entity55 , @entity56			0
in heart - breaking testimony to the @entity23 last november , @entity30 recounted the night of march 24 , 2002 , when she rang her daughter ’s mobile phone and found fresh space was available on its previously full voicemail account			0
she shouted to her husband : ‘ she ’s picked up her voicemail , @entity66			0
she ’s alive ! ’ victim : the @entity3 admitted hacking @entity5 's mobile phone but it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted deliberately or were removed from her message box automatically the previously automated response had suddenly reverted to @entity16 ’s own greeting			1
the sound of her daughter ’s voice led mrs @entity30 to believe @entity16 had deleted some messages			1
but the @entity79 inquiry found the deletions had been made automatically by the phone company , which at that time automatically wiped all messages after 72 hours			1
mr @entity36 said there is no evidence anyone attempted to hack @entity16 ’s mobile phone before march 26 , 2002 , two days after mrs @entity30 made the call which gave her false hope			0
he said police can not conclusively say whether any of @entity16 ’s voicemails were manually deleted after that date , although two messages are missing			1
he added : ‘ it is not known why that happened and it will not now be possible to provide an explanation			0
’ false hope : the @entity49 also criticised police for not prosecuting phone hacking in 2002 , the year their daughter 's mobile was accessed yesterday , after carrying out a detailed analysis of call data and phone company procedures at the time , mr @entity36 effectively confirmed that it was ‘ unlikely ’ the @entity3 was behind the deletions			0
@entity16 ’s body was discovered in woodland in september 2002			0
last year former nightclub doorman @entity110 was jailed for life for her murder .			0

the @entity33 inquiry heard that it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted deliberately or were removed automatically
