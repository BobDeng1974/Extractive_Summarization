when @entity1 asked @entity2 , moments after the defeat by @entity5 , whether @entity6 were obsessed with stats , you half - expected @entity2 to hit back with : ' yes , but only 23.54 per cent of the time ! ' not long after , a shattered - looking @entity9 told @entity10 : ‘ we ’ve got to have a look at the data ’			1
and , hey presto , @entity6 ’s latest @entity15 fiasco had its epitaph			1
the raw data of this @entity15 – four humiliations sandwiching a win against @entity20 – confirm what most @entity22 observers worked out a long time ago : @entity6 are not naturally inclined towards the one - day game , and make things worse by talking about a ‘ brand ’ of cricket that bears no relation to the one they play or to the players they select			1
a solemn - looking @entity6 captain @entity2 arrives at @entity32 on tuesday morning the @entity34 press has predictably stuck the boot in hard on @entity6 's @entity15 flops @entity36 wears a sorry look as the batsman arrives in @entity32 ahead of the game against @entity40 @entity41 walks onto the team bus after flying from @entity43 , scene of @entity6 's latest humiliation @entity46 said that @entity6 were not as reliant on stats as some claim			1
but even if the truth lies somewhere between @entity2 ’s denial and @entity9 ’s unwitting revelation , it seems clear that no other team talks numbers with as much pseudo-religious relish			1
and if it is true that @entity6 encourage the players to trust their gut instinct , why then do they bat as if they ’ve been told it ’s ok to score at 4.5 for 20 overs ? if @entity9 ca n’t see that this is a team frightened by their own shadow ( and , no doubt , by their own shadow ’s bowling average ) , then things are going to get worse before they get better			1
@entity9 insisted he was still keen on the job , and @entity70 – the man who once called him ‘ the outstanding coach of his generation ’ – later declared ‘ i ’ve got every faith in @entity9 ’ , as if the chairmanship of a football club was the job that got away			1
but will the incoming @entity79 chairman @entity78 and chief executive @entity80 share @entity70 ’s faith – or even have any faith in @entity84 himself ? @entity9 ( left ) was ridiculed for saying ' we 'll have to look at the data ' following defeat by @entity5 @entity2 shows the strain after @entity6 were dumped out of the @entity15 before the quarter - finals @entity5 bowler @entity90 ( centre ) celebrates during his team 's 15 - run victory on monday the case for @entity9 ’s defence revolves around the fact that @entity6 have been mainly hopeless at one - day cricket since the 1992 @entity15			1
and one - day cricket is all @entity6 have been playing since they won three tests in a row against @entity102 in july and august			2
his advocates also argue that he inherited a shambles born of an @entity107 whitewash , just as he did when he first got the job in 2007			2
unlike @entity109 , he did not have @entity110 , @entity111 or @entity112 at his disposal			2
it was , his supporters argue , never going to turn around overnight			0
but @entity9 is nearly a year into his second stint , and @entity6 are going backwards			1
in all formats they have won 13 games out of 36 ( forgive the stat ) , including two victories against @entity20			0
their one notable success – a 3 - 1 test win – lost much of its lustre because of @entity102 ’s hopelessness			0
for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity131 : @ the_topspin @entity9 is a genuine and decent man , as ego - free as any coach on the international circuit			1
it is not his fault that county teams only recently reintroduced the 50 - over format			0
he did n’t write the @entity79 ’s strategic plan , which cited winning this @entity15 as one of its ‘ key measures ’			1
and we hope he has been tearing his hair out at the failure of @entity41 and @entity143 to impose themselves on this competition			0
but @entity147 ’s coaching ambitions paid the price for a single result – the @entity150 defeat by @entity151			0
for @entity9 , the results are beginning to look as wasteful as an @entity154 butter mountain			1
and there are some crucial areas in which he must surely be accountable			0
@entity9 was one of the selectors who last summer backed @entity158 as one - day captain , robbing @entity2 of the chance to acquaint himself with the job during the home series against @entity102 and the trip to @entity164			2
that stubbornness meant @entity2 was learning on the job			0
is it any surprise that his batting has disintegrated ? then there was the tinkering for @entity6 ’s tournament opener against @entity173			1
what possessed @entity175 to demote @entity176 from @entity177 , and replace him with @entity178 , who had just returned from injury , rather than with @entity180 , a proven match - winner in limited - overs internationals ? @entity9 is due to rouse the likes of @entity143 for @entity107 in the summer - but will he still be in a job ? @entity185 was one of five top - order batsmen caught behind against @entity187 in @entity189 - style dismissals old foe @entity190 ( centre ) and the mighty @entity34 await @entity6 again in the ashes and what of the tendency to err on the side of caution ? against @entity5 , five of the top seven were out caught in the slip cordon , as if they were playing test cricket			1
if these things are not @entity9 ’s department , what are ? @entity205 must now decide whether @entity6 can risk giving the @entity84 / @entity175 ticket a crack at the @entity107 – victory in which , by the way , also forms part of the @entity79 ’s strategic plan			1
waiting in the wings is @entity213 , a figure @entity78 admires from their time together at @entity216 , where @entity213 also worked with @entity217 , @entity219 ’s no 2			2
@entity78 may be unimpressed with @entity6 ’s out - of - date tactics in @entity173 , and equally concerned to hear @entity70 tell @entity221 : ‘ what has struck me has been how much influence @entity223 is having on one - day cricket , and a lot of our players do n't play much @entity223 cricket , so that is clearly something we have to look at			1
’ well , who ’d have thought it ! the sadness is that no @entity234 fans will lament their absence from the @entity15 quarter - finals			2
they played dull , fearful cricket , stuck between a rock and a time warp			0
even factoring in the global schadenfreude that usually accompanies an @entity6 defeat , they have re-entered the realms of laughing stock			2
if @entity78 is happy with that , then @entity245 help @entity248 cricket			2
@entity250 @entity111 on the money @entity111 ’s views may not be welcome at @entity253 , but he had a pertinent point to make after @entity6 ’s 15 - run defeat by @entity5			1
‘ do not say we havent @entity257 ! ’ he tweet - screamed			0
‘ we played a back to back @entity107 to make sure @entity6 played 6 months of @entity259 's before this wc ! ’ and he ’s right			1
far from helping @entity6 in either event , the rejigged schedule has , in successive winters , produced the joint - worst @entity107 defeat in history and their most miserable exit yet from a @entity15			1
a home loss to @entity173 this summer and the @entity79 will have presided over quite the hat - trick			1
outspoken @entity6 critic @entity111 ( centre ) watches @entity270 vs @entity271 last saturday respectfully yours , the @entity272 speaking of laughing stocks , the @entity272 press release that followed @entity275 ’s invective - laden outburst against an @entity277 journalist ( the wrong one , as it turned out ) was a classic of its genre			2
having already issued a peremptory – and entirely wrong – statement , in which it was claimed @entity275 had n’t sworn and had apologised to the journalist in person , the @entity277 board then issued another			0
the takeaway line was this : ‘ the @entity272 respects the role played by the media in covering and popularising the game of cricket , and acknowledges the support of the media , in its mission to administer and promote the game of cricket in @entity102			0
’ so respectful are the @entity272 of the media that press releases on tour routinely read : ‘ monday : no media activity			0
tuesday : no media activity			0
wednesday : no media activity			0
’ thank goodness for the respect … @entity275 enjoys a kickabout in training with @entity102 - but his team are not playing ball with the media reporters , not supporters then again , perhaps it ’s just a misunderstanding			2
as the @entity277 board sought to manage the damage , they wheeled out @entity317 , the thoughtful off - spinner			0
‘ media here are here to support us , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s very heartening to see the media turn up in huge numbers and try to support us			0
’ it ’s not known whether @entity317 handed out pom - poms and tutu skirts to the assembled hacks , but then he clearly thought he did n’t need to			0
@entity102 off - spinner @entity317 ( right ) celebrates a wicket against @entity333 in @entity334 on tuesday			0
