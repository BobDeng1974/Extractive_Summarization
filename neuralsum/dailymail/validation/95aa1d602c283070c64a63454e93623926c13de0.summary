moments after last night 's tv contest came off air , @entity3 's election chief @entity2 was briefing journalists on how well his man had done			1
without doubt @entity7 had won , he declared confidently			2
but he was cut off mid-sentence by news that the first poll was in , which told a different story			0
some 54 per cent of people thought @entity14 had triumphed , which is a slender win for the @entity17 camp who have grown complacent about the idea that mr @entity7 's dire personal ratings will stop his path to @entity22			1
two snap polls after the tv election contest gave @entity14 the lead - but only just @entity14 and @entity7 were interviewed by @entity26 and questioned by an audience of voters as part of the first tv election contest of the campaign pollster @entity32 said its snap verdict giving a narrow victory for mr @entity14 in the first of the leaders ' election broadcasts represented the company 's ' best guess ' of the nationwide response			1
in is survey for the @entity42 it found that 46 per cent felt that mr @entity14 had the best arguments , as against 44 per cent who said the same of mr @entity7			1
the prime minister was judged marginally more convincing than the panel , by a difference of 48 per cent to 43 per cent			1
the @entity32 panel also felt mr @entity14 better answered the questions he was asked , winning on this measure by 44 per cent to 37 per cent			1
in a boost for @entity3 , 56 per cent of floating voters said they were more likely to vote @entity3 , compared with 30 per cent more likely to vote @entity17			0
however , those in this section of the group were only a very small sub-set of the wider group			0
a separate @entity59 result found 51 per cent thought mr @entity14 won , with mr @entity7 on 49 per cent			1
the two men vying for the keys to @entity22 on may 7 did not go head - to - head but instead appeared separately to be interviewed by @entity26 and questioned by an audience of voters			0
in an 18 - minute grilling , mr @entity14 was forced to defend not cutting immigration while putting up vat , questioned about the rise of food banks in @entity70 and his failure to spell out where Â£ 12billion in welfare cuts will come from			1
@entity26 appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing prime minister @entity14 and he appeared taken aback when asked about the company he keeps , including a minister caught up in a tax scandal , a spin doctor jailed for phone hacking and being friends with @entity81 , who was sacked from @entity82 after punching a colleague			1
but mr @entity7 faced a difficult ride time from both the studio audience and @entity26 about whether he is tough enough to lead the country			2
the @entity3 leader insisted : ' am i tough enough ? hell , yes , i 'm tough enough			0
' the contest was played out on social media , with almost every tv - related tweet sent last night discussing the election contest			2
in a blog post , @entity93 cited @entity96 analysis stating the debate made up 94.7 per cent of @entity99 @entity93 conversation about tv over the evening , with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm			1
there were more mentions of mr @entity14 than mr @entity7 but @entity3 saw more mentions than the @entity17 , while the moment that generated the most tweets came at the end of the debate as mr @entity26 asked the @entity3 leader : ' are you ok , @entity107 ? ' @entity110 leader @entity109 and media mogul @entity111 were among those whose eyes were glued to @entity114 and @entity115 's much - anticipated question and answer session with @entity14 and @entity7			1
the debate accounted for 94.7 per cent of @entity99 @entity93 conversation about tv over the evening , with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm when the @entity3 leader declared he was tough enough to be prime minister by virtue of having stood up to mr @entity111 , the @entity120 owner tweeted : ' thanks for 2 mentions , @entity7			1
only met once for all of 2 minutes when you embarrassed me with over the top flattery			0
' former @entity128 and celebrity @entity129 star @entity127 was not impressed with @entity7 either , tweeting : ' if this man is prime minister i will leave the @entity99			1
this man is not @entity70			2
this is @entity132 in a chuffing suit			0
' and @entity135 's ceo @entity134 said : ' this is not the same @entity3 that people voted for under @entity138			0
@entity7 is like @entity139 without the personality			2
' but mr @entity109 had a kind word for his @entity3 counterpart , tweeting : ' @entity7 is showing more humour and courage than @entity14 ! @entity145			1
' but he attacked mr @entity7 over @entity147 and immigration and mocked mr @entity14 for being ' smarmy '			2
the @entity150 parliamentary candidate said : ' his constant complimenting of audience for their questions is making @entity14 look rather smarmy and lacking in sincerity			2
' @entity138 's former spin doctor @entity156 felt it was good night for mr @entity7			0
he said : ' @entity158 , neutral for @entity159 , bad for @entity26 , dire for @entity160			0
' others questioned mr @entity26 's skills as an interviewer , with @entity165 boss @entity165 tweeting : ' i think @entity7 made mincemeat out of @entity26			0
' @entity168 weighed in , tweeting : ' @entity26 eviscerated @entity14 with such masterful savagery ... that @entity14 won all the debate polls			1
' but @entity173 host @entity171 backed the former @entity175 anchor , saying : ' audience questions after @entity26 is like when @entity177 bring on @entity178 for @entity179			0
' as did @entity182 presenter @entity181 : ' @entity180 was superb tonight			0
but winging it towards end with @entity7			0
seemed better prepared against @entity14			0
' and he added : ' @entity7 was struggling at times but viewers will perhaps think he stood up better to @entity180 than the pm			0

@entity32 / @entity42 poll found 54 ****%**** thought @entity14 won with @entity7 on 46 ****%****
