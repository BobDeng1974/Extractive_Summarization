however , they were allowed to go on their way after the officers were assured they had been given permission to borrow the canoe to use on the snow			1

‘ it ’s a hundredweight and usually takes a few people to shift it			0
‘ [ my neighbour ] called the police but when they arrived [ they were told ] they had permission to go sledging in it and that was that			2
‘ they just let them go on their way			0
‘ i do n’t know about anyone else but i have never seen a 17ft canoe going sledging before			2
‘ for the police not even to take names when they are on a call about a stolen canoe is ridiculous			2

the canoe has been recoved and will be returned to its owner			2
’ the canoe , which has now been recovered , was given to mr @entity22 by an old friend and he said it is ' irreplaceable ' mr @entity22 said : ‘ it ’s just so frustrating , it ’s the sentimental value to me			1
i have no idea how much it ’s actually worth			0
i did give it a new paint job though last summer , and that cost me £ 250			0
’ he said an inspector had visited him to apologise			0
he said : ‘ his exact words to me were “ i ’m here to eat humble pie ” ‘ i just ca n’t believe it happened			0
