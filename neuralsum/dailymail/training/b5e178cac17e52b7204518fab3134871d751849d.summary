by @entity1 reporter published : 20:01 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 05:03 est , 13 june 2012 its distinctive sirens would have been heard moments before it dropped the bombs over @entity7 that set the @entity8 in motion			1
but despite its important role in history , very few @entity12 @entity11 dive bombers survive to this day			2
there are currently only two complete planes still around - and neither on display in @entity12			1
but now @entity12 military divers are working to hoist the wreck of one of the single - engine monoplanes from the floor of the @entity24			2
bombs away : @entity12 divers retrieve pieces of the @entity11 dive bomber from the @entity24 sea terror of the skies : the @entity11 wreaked havoc over @entity32 as part of the @entity35 war machine initial reports are that it is in good condition despite having spent the past seven decades lying on the seabed			1
the wreck , first discovered in the 1990s when a fisherman 's nets snagged on it , lies about 10 kilometers off the coast of the @entity12 @entity24 island of @entity46 , in about 60 feet of water			2
the divers have been working over the past week to prepare the bomber to be hoisted to the surface , using fire hoses to carefully free it from the sand			2
they have already brought up smaller pieces and also hauled up its motor over the weekend			0
captain @entity57 , from the @entity58 in @entity59 , which is running the recovery operation , said they were now working to free the main 30ft fuselage piece and expect to bring it to the surface on tuesday , depending on the weather			0
the @entity58 plans to eventually display the @entity11 at its @entity66 , located at the former @entity68 airport in @entity69			0
capt @entity57 said : ' from my perspective there 's a lot of damage - it 's been under water for 70 years - but our restoration crew says it 's in really good condition for being restored			0
' that 's our goal - a complete restoration and not conservation as a wreck			1
' war machine : workers unload the engine complete with wooden propeller from the striken ' @entity11 ' @entity87 : a penknife that was recovered out of the wreckage of the feared @entity8 plane so far , little is known about this particular plane - when it crashed , who its pilot and gunner were and whether they survived the crash is still a mystery			1
once the plane is brought to the surface , researchers will use the serial number to track down this information			1
the @entity104 - known by most as the @entity11 , which is short for the @entity12 word for dive bomber ' @entity104 ' - first saw service in the 1936 - 1939 @entity109 , being sent by @entity110 to help the fascists			0
the only two known complete @entity113 are on display at the @entity115 in @entity116 and at the @entity117 in @entity118			1
@entity57 said from the motor , the one just found is also likely a later model ' @entity123			0
' still , to find such a complete example is ' terrific , ' said @entity125 , curator of the aircraft collection at the @entity115			2
' you are still talking about less than a dozen in the world , even if you include every back end and center section found on the @entity133 steppes , ' he said			0
' following its service in @entity136 , @entity113 fired the first shots of the @entity8 , dropping @entity35 bombs on the @entity7 town of @entity140 on september 1 , 1939 , killing some 1,200 civilians			1
find : the wreck which was first discovered in the 1990s when a fisherman 's nets snagged on it , lay about 10 kilometers off the coast of the @entity12 @entity24 island of @entity46 @entity12 ace @entity148 claimed to have destroyed more than 500 tanks , mostly on the @entity150 , and several ships including a @entity153 battleship , primarily in the @entity104			0
the @entity11 was used throughout the @entity8 , but for all its successes in the early days on the @entity156 and in the later invasion of the @entity153 , the aircraft was later outclassed by quicker and more maneuverable @entity159 fighter planes			1
as museum pieces today , they 're a big draw for visitors and also important for researchers and historians , said @entity166 , director of collections at @entity118 's @entity117			0
the museum 's @entity11 had been shot down over @entity169 in the last year of the @entity8			1
' the discovery and raising of a third @entity11 from the sea floor will be a great asset for both scholars and the general public interested in learning more about historic military technology as well as this critical period in our world history , ' she said .			0

*salvage* team now hopes to completely restore the plane
