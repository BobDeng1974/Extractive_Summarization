a nephew of sir @entity1 yesterday told how his celebrity uncle attended ‘ paedophile parties ’			1
@entity4 was just 13 when ‘ @entity10 ’ took him to a wealthy celebrity ’s house in @entity7 in 1967 for the first of many sordid social gatherings			1
over the next 18 months , @entity4 and his friends went to numerous ‘ parties ’ where he believes men sexually abused girls and boys as young as ten			1
@entity1 was at many of these events , he said			2
@entity4 , pictured left aged eight , and right aged 59 today , says when he was 13 his uncle @entity10 started taking him to ' paedophile parties ' @entity4 and his teenage friends were used as ‘ intermediaries ’ to hang out with the younger victims			1
@entity4 , now 59 , said the youngsters would disappear into the bedrooms with men and return later			1
he said there were ‘ never any women ’ at the parties and although he did n’t see any sexual abuse , it was ‘ perfectly obvious ’ what was happening			1
several household names from the world of showbusiness were party regulars			1
@entity4 said @entity1 sometimes arrived with a man dressed as a priest and he believed the young victims may have come from an orphanage or children ’s home			1
he has regularly spoken to friends about his experiences in the late 1960s , but no one took him seriously until this week ’s revelations			2
‘ i have loved all this coming out about @entity10 and i feel guilty i did n’t do something about it earlier , ’ he told the @entity47 yesterday			2
after @entity1 died last year , @entity4 was one of the relatives who publicly praised him			1
but he knew he was being a hypocrite			2
‘ i felt as low and as bad as you can get not saying anything			2
’ other members of @entity1 ’s family spoke out last week to condemn a tv programme alleging the @entity58 sexually abused teenage girls , but the nephew said many relatives were aware of his sordid past			2
the roofer from @entity64 later married and he now has four children and ten grandchildren with his wife @entity67			1
the late @entity1 , pictured in the 1970 's working as a porter at @entity70 , has been accused by his nephew of attending parties in @entity7 attended by children as young as ten but during his youth he was in and out of trouble and believes his seedy experiences in @entity7 were to blame for his problems			1
@entity4 came from a large family – his mother , who was @entity1 ’s sister , gave birth to ‘ about 18 ’ children – and he grew up in a council house in @entity64			1
@entity10 was always the family celebrity			2
‘ it was like the @entity84 coming to your house , ’ recalled @entity4			1
‘ he would drive us around in his @entity88 and he gave us a colour television and a telephone			2
’ at 13 , @entity4 and three friends hitch - hiked to @entity7 ‘ for an adventure ’			1
they returned home about five weeks later but regularly ran away to the capital for similar periods			0
on the first trip in 1967 , the group of boys went to @entity100 and were quickly invited to a grubby flat by men who recognised them as easy prey , although @entity4 says he was never abused			1
‘ about four days later ’ , @entity1 turned up at the flat where they were staying			0
‘ he recognised me and i thought “ this is it , i ’m going to get in big trouble here ”			0
i had n’t been in touch with my parents to tell them where i was			0
but @entity10 just took us away to a much better place			0
’ @entity1 turned up by coincidence at the address because he mixed with ‘ fellow child molesters ’ , said @entity4			1
the group of runaways ended up in a fabulous house – believed to belong to a famous pop impresario – with a big indoor swimming pool			0
the celebrity home was one of the party venues			0
‘ at night you would get about 15 or 20 people turning up			0
there would be music and tables full of food , we could n’t believe it			0
there was everything we needed and we just hung around			0
‘ at first we automatically assumed the children lived there , but we soon realised they did n’t			2
they would be brought there , sometimes by @entity10 , and would stay for six or seven hours until 3 or 4am			0
they were just little kids , boys and girls			0
‘ two or three would go off and come back later			0
the really strange thing was that they did n’t come out the bedrooms kicking and screaming			2
none of them seemed to be in any distress , but there is no doubt at all in my mind what they were being used for			0
relation : @entity4 says that his family will agree that his uncle 's body should be removed and cremated ‘ they used to say they were “ playing			1
” you heard sounds and moans and groans coming from the bedroom and knew what was going on			0
’ @entity4 said he believed he and his friends were there to ‘ keep the kids happy ’			1
he said : ‘ i did n’t think anything about it at the time , maybe because there was no such thing as paedophiles back then			0
i never saw @entity1 sexually abuse any of the children , but as far as i am concerned he was part of a paedophile ring at those parties			1
’ the excursions ended when the teenager got into trouble with the law and was sent to borstal			0
in later life , @entity4 said he put his past behind him and became close to @entity183			1
however , they never spoke about what happened and he was concerned that his mother should never find out			0
‘ although i was not sexually abused i do feel like a victim myself			0
i think i should have reported him years ago but i was too scared to do it			0
‘ now i am really pleased everyone knows the truth			0

@entity4 , now 59 , said he and his teenage friends were taken to act as intermediaries for *adults* and younger children
he said children as young as ten would disappear into bedrooms with men and return later
while he did not see anything , he says it was ' perfectly obvious ' what was happening
said parties were attended by other households names in showbusiness , but never any women
