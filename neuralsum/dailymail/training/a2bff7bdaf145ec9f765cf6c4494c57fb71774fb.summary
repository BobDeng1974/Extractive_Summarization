published : 22:31 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 02:59 est , 3 october 2013 @entity0 has long been considered a combination of folklore , misidentification , and hoax , but on tuesday a team of researchers screened what they claim is conclusive evidence that the creature , also known as @entity0 , exists			1
during a news conference in @entity13 , the group of experts played several short clips that they described as ‘ never before seen hd video ’ of the supposed ape - like creature			1
the footage consisted of very short , grainy and out - of - focus clips of various apparently human - like , hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in @entity21			1
‘ this was a serious study , ’ dr. @entity41 told @entity42			0
she is an expert in forensics and is a director of the project after being impressed by the evidence			2
the exclusive footage came from a similar effort dubbed @entity51 , which was led by @entity52			2
that group said it captured the ' definitive video and @entity56 evidence from the elusive @entity0			1
' during tuesday 's news conference , several clips were shown which the group claims is video evidence that proves @entity0 is real			1
the group of experts played several short clips that they described as ' never before seen hd video ' of the supposed ape - like creature it included footage captured in @entity21 in 2005 shows a female @entity0 sleeping			1
an extended version of the video is expected to be released in a future documentary			0
‘ we 've all had experiences that changed our lives , ’ said researcher @entity71 , who showed photos he had taken of footprints in the snow that he believed belonged to @entity0			2
the announcement comes a week after a new map was unveiled that plots out every reported @entity0 sighting in @entity82 for the last 92 years			1
phd candidate @entity83 mapped out the 3,313 possible @entity0 spots since 1921 and found that people do seem to glimpse the hairy creature much more in some regions than others			1
the map and data collated by the @entity91 show , for example , that @entity0 has supposedly been spotted three times more often in @entity94 than neighboring @entity95			2
dr. @entity41 said she joined the project after being impressed by the evidence , while researcher @entity71 said all of the team had ‘ had experiences that changed our lives ’ researcher @entity71 showed this photo that he had taken of footprints in the snow that he believed belonged to @entity0 @entity83 explains on his website : ' right away you can see that sightings are not evenly distributed			1
at first glance , it looks a lot like a map of population distribution			0
' this makes sense - by a law of averages you would expect an area with more people to report more possible @entity0 viewings			1
even so , there are some very bright spots around the @entity123 , @entity124 , the @entity126 mountains , @entity127 and the @entity128			0
yet it gets intriguing when @entity83 maps the relationship between reported sightings and population density			0
as he notes : ' there are distinct regions where sightings are incredibly common , despite a very sparse population			0
spotting a sasquatch ? there are regions of @entity140 where sightings are very common , despite a low population			0
and most of them are in the @entity145 ' on the other hand , in some of the most densely populated areas sasquatch sightings are exceedingly rare			0
' most of these @entity0 hot spots are in the @entity145			2
@entity83 acknowledges that ' terrain and habitat likely play a major role in the distribution of reports			0
' he notes that the population data is based on @entity158 figures that only take into account where people live , not where they vacation or travel			0
@entity83 also says that the reporting mechanism is not hugely precise as the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) only allow spotters to enter the nearest city .			0

after five years and $ 500,000 , the @entity23 presented footage on tuesday which it claims is conclusive proof that @entity0 exists
the footage consists of grainy and out - of - focus clips of various apparently human - like , hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in @entity21
the group claimed the footage captured the ' definitive video and @entity56 evidence from the elusive @entity0 '
