by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 10:17 est , 14 august 2012 ' @entity1 with historical appeal ' : the gold ingot which is set to go on sale at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , next month a gold bar recovered from a ship that sank during the @entity10 is up for auction - with an estimate set at 211 times it 's original value			1
the ingot , which weighs 40oz and is expected to sell for about $ 140,000 , was part of a 10 - ton hoard of gold that went down with the @entity19 in 1857			1
at the time , the cargo was worth $ 2million and its loss during a hurricane contributed to the ‘ @entity23 ’ - the world ’s first world - wide economic crisis			1
in 1987 much of the hoard was recovered from the seabed after the so - called ‘ @entity19 ’ was discovered in the @entity28			1
the epic discovery sparked a nine year legal battle after a host of insurance companies that paid out for the loss 155 years ago claimed ownership			1
but it was ruled that 92 per cent of the bullion should be awarded to the discovery team , led by @entity38 , whose company @entity19 found the ship			1
now this @entity41 and @entity42 ingot from the ship is to be sold at auction			1
stamped on its base is the bar ’s original value of $ 743.70 along with ‘ @entity41 and @entity42 ’			2
the reverse is a plain casting save for the serial number 648 repeated at the top			2
@entity53 , director of the rare coins department at auctioneers @entity5 , said : ' this is a highly impressive example that sports gleaming yellow - gold colour and few imperfections as made			1
' it is a piece rich with historical appeal that is an indelible link to the great @entity10			2
' this lot includes a certificate of authenticity from the @entity19 and signed by @entity38 , indicating it was recovered from the @entity19			2
' we are delighted to offer such a rare and unusual piece related to the @entity10			2
' this engraving shows the sinking of the @entity19 , which sank in a storm of the coast of the @entity71 with the loss of 426 lives and £ 1.3million worth of gold cargo the gold ship , a 278ft - long sidewheel steamer , had 578 passengers and crew on board when she left the @entity81 port of @entity82 on september 3 1857 , bound for @entity83 under the command of @entity85			1
after a stop in @entity87 , she continued north up the @entity89 east coast until , on september 9 , she was caught in a category 2 hurricane off the coast of the @entity71			2
after two days rocked by the fierce tempest , the @entity19 's sails were shredded , she was taking on water , and her boiler was on the verge of being extinguished			0
her fate was sealed when one of the seals to the paddle wheels sprang a leak and , by noon that day , her engineers could keep the boiler 's fire burning no longer			0
the resulting fall in steam pressure shut down both the pumps that were keeping water at bay and the paddle wheels that had kept her bow to the wind			0
in an attempt to draw attention to their plight , passengers and crew flew the ship 's flag upside down , a universal sign of distress , to try to signal a passing ship			1
a bucket brigade was formed and her passengers and crew spent the night fighting a losing battle against the rising water			0
treasures : these gold nuggets , bars and coins from the @entity19 lay on the ocean floor for over 140 years until their recovery in 1987 by @entity89 firm @entity19 the @entity19 was recovered by @entity135 - based treasure hunters @entity19 using a remote - controlled submarine in 1987			1
the group , led by @entity38 , located the wreck using bayesian search theory , where a number of factors are taken into account direct the search for lost objects			1
significant amounts of gold and other artifacts were then recovered and brought to the surface using another remote - controlled sub built specifically for the recovery			1
after the mr @entity38 announced the find , 39 insurance companies filed a suit claiming they had a right to the gold , on the grounds that they had paid out the damages for its loss in the @entity161			1
the team that found it argued in court that the gold had been abandoned and , after a legal battle , they were awarded 92 per cent of the treasure trove in 1996			0
the total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $ 150million			0
one recovered ingot weighing 80lb sold for a record $ 8million and was recognised as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time			2
as the ship passed the eye of the storm , engineers made vain attempts to relight the boiler			2
the second half of the storm then struck			0
without power the @entity19 was carried along with the hurricane , unable to escape the powerful winds			0
the next morning two ships were spotted and 153 passengers , mainly women and children , managed to make their way over in lifeboats			0
however the intense winds and heavy seas pulled the @entity19 and the rest of her company away from any hope of rescue			0
by 8pm that night , the ship sank with them - and her precious cargo - still aboard			1
when she left on her fateful journey the value of the gold was $ 2million			0
when the cargo was brought up the gold recovered was estimated to be worth as much as $ 150million			0
also being sold at the same auction are two rare $ 50 gold coins that were struck in 1915 to celebrate the completion of the @entity209			0
a rare round version of the @entity212 coin is expected to sell for $ 80,000 and an octagonal coin attached to a gold chain with a key at one end and corkscrew at the other is tipped to sell for $ 20,000			0
the auction takes place at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , on september 2			0
also up for grabs : these two rare $ 50 gold coins , struck in 1915 to celebrated the completion of the @entity209 , are expected to reach £ 50,000 when they go under the hammer			0
