by @entity0 heard the one about the penguin that walks into a bar ? no ? neither had we until we saw this hilarious video showing an @entity7 penguin strolling around a beach restaurant after taking a break from his colony near @entity12 , @entity13			1
the brazen bird was captured on camera wandering around the popular guesthouse before eventually being shooed out after overstaying his welcome			0
guests at the the @entity22 can be heard in hysterics as the bird cleverly evades staff by waddling in a circle around a coffee table			2
at one point the curious penguin stops in his tracks , sparking a stand - off with gawping members of staff at the guest - house , situated near @entity51 , south of @entity12			0
checking out : staff finally manage to push the penguin back outside after a little gentle coaxing with a broom in one last effort to stay in the restaurant , the penguin attempts to dart under a different table but this time is eventually shown the door after some gentle coaxing with a broom			0
the unexpected guest is part of a 3,000 - strong colony that live just metres from the resort , with some even nesting in the hotel 's garden , to the delight of guests			1
@entity71 , 37 , manager of the guesthouse and restaurant , said : ' in season , we get them coming in a lot and all the guests love taking pictures of them			2
' the penguin colony lives 70 metres from the @entity22 , with some even nesting in the garden ' they 're friendly animals , unless you give them a fright , but sometimes it 's quite hard to get them out			1
we have about three nests in the grounds of the lodge			0
' the rest of the colony lives about 70 metres away by the beach			1
they 're very popular with people who stay here , although they 're pretty noisy at night time			0
