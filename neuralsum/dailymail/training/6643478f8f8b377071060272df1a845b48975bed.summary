by @entity0 last updated at 6:46 pm on 30th december 2011 scientists have finally unravelled why scorpions glow bright green under ultraviolet light			2
the ability is widely known - but biologists have puzzled over why the creatures might have evolved it			2
biologist @entity9 of the @entity10 investigated the ' fluorescence ' and found that the creatures can ' sense ' light using their tails			1
the creatures may to have evolved the ability to help them scuttle away under rocks			0
scorpion under ultraviolet light : biologist @entity9 of the @entity10 investigated the ' fluorescence ' and found that the creatures seem to be able to ' sense ' light using their tails ' @entity20 are largely solitary , nocturnal arachnids that glow a bright cyan - green under uv light , ' wrote @entity9 in a paper in @entity30			1
' the function of this fluorescence is a mystery			0
' @entity9 's team ' blindfolded ' scorpions , then tested them with various different colours of light - and found that the tails seemed to function like secondary ' eyes '			0
the insects ' shell works as a ' whole - body ' sensor which relays information about light to the nervous system - so any part of a scorpion can ' see '			0
@entity20 's shells appear to be able to send information to the scorpion so that their whole body works like a giant ' eye ' - enabling the creature to seek shelter more effectively ' the cuticle ( casing ) may function as a whole - body light collector which relays information to the nervous system , ' the researchers wrote			1
' @entity20 may use this information to detect shelter , as blocking any part of the cuticle could diminish the signal			1

@entity20 ' sense ' light with their bodies
may help the creatures to seek shelter
