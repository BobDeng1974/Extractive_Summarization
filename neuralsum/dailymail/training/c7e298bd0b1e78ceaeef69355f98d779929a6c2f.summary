bungling council workers have created a challenger for the world ’s shortest cycle lane which measures just 8ft - long			1
the bike lane on @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity4 is just 8ft 2ins - barely longer than a bike - and has left cyclists wondering what the point of it is			1
it is not the first time ridiculously short bike lanes have been marked out on @entity17 roads with another in @entity4 measuring just 8ft long earlier this year , and in 2006 a 5ft - long lane made headlines in @entity21			1
barely longer than a bike : a cyclist uses the 8ft - long cycle lane in @entity4 which has left bike riders baffled by the logic of putting in a bike lane so small council workers in @entity29 were criticised for building an 8ft bike lane in 2010 at the estimated cost of £ 2,000			1
@entity33 cyclists were left baffled with the logic behind the lane when an official told them it was to ' highlight the interface between the eastbound carriageway and the beginning of a new contraflow facility '			2
for clarity a council spokesman added that it was to alert cyclists to the left hand turn into a new facility			2
a @entity7 council spokesman said their latest path did not cost the council anything			1
' planning obligations ' : a council spokesman said the bike lane indicated where cyclists join the general traffic , giving them ' space ' to do so safely no cost : @entity7 council did not pay for the bike lane ( pictured ) but council workers in @entity29 were criticised in 2010 for creating an 8ft bike lane which cost an estimated £ 2,000 she said : ‘ it was paid for by the developer of a power station as part of its planning obligations			1
‘ the red area marks where the off - road pedestrian and cycle route ends and cyclists join with general traffic			0
‘ it is designed to alert motorists to cyclists joining the road , as well as give cyclists the space to do safely			1
’ but cyclists have been left scratching their heads on how best to use the new ‘ lane ’			0
one cyclist said : ‘ it ’s ridiculous			0
is it really worth having such a small cycle path ? ‘ you could n’t cycle in it because it ’s so small			0
you just have time to get in the saddle before getting off again			0
’ short in @entity89 too : cyclist @entity90 noticed last year that there was three 20ft - long bike lanes marked out out just a quarter of a mile apart in @entity89 last year , three 20ft - long bike lanes were marked out just a quarter of a mile apart in the @entity95 area of the city			2
cyclist @entity90 , 21 said at the time : ' if an area is going to have cycle lanes to save pollution and traffic , they should at least make sure they go somewhere , or are at least long enough to bother cycling on			0
' but a spokesman for @entity105 said : ' the cycle lanes make it clear where cyclists should go			0
' the lanes clearly guide cyclists to the dropped kerb where they can leave the road and ride on the footway to a safe crossing of the busy @entity115			2
’ even across the @entity119 , the @entity117 city of @entity118 made their own ridiculous bike path , 8ft 8ins , with ‘ @entity122 ’ signs at each end .			0

the bike lane on @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity4 is just 8ft 2ins long
other bikes lanes in @entity17 have been criticised for being too short
@entity7 council said the lane did not cost them anything
it is to ' alert motorists to cyclists joining the road '
