the @entity0 is sacred , intimidating and iconic - and @entity2 hooker @entity1 looks like he has it down to a fine art. that 's the opinion of the @entity7 team anyway , given the @entity0 swamp the @entity8 international after he performs the @entity10 through for them at the recent @entity11			1
it makes for great viewing as the 20 - year - old goes through the lot - words and actions - before the @entity7 players let him know what they make of the former @entity22 player 's @entity20 war dance			1
@entity7 are famous for performing their @entity10 before matches in a bid to intimidate their opposition			2
their most recent showing was in the 3 - 0 whitewash over @entity51 in a three - @entity53 series that started well , but ended in resounding defeat			0
it was a tour that promised so much , yet left @entity57 's side with little to show for their brave efforts			0
black - wash : the @entity0 came out on top and beat @entity51 3 - 0 in the three - @entity53 series the real thing : @entity7 perform the haka at @entity62 against @entity51 stand - off : @entity51 line up to face the @entity65 on saturday ahead of their third defeat			0

@entity1 , a @entity69 player for @entity70 , performs @entity0 for @entity7 players at recent @entity11
all blacks go wild *celebrating* after @entity1 completes @entity10 in full
@entity10 is a *traditional* war *cry* , famously performed by @entity7
