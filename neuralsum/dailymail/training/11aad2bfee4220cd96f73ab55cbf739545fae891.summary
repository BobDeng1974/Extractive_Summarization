initially believed to have crashed into another boat , gps tracking devices shows that the boat likely hit rocks instead			1
@entity39 , who found the wreckage saturday while on safety patrol , said debris strewn over 2 square miles looked as if the boat had ‘ gone through a blender , ’ with some of it a quarter - mile from the shore			2
the @entity48 medical examiner said @entity49 , 53 , of @entity50 and @entity51 , 57 , of @entity52 , both died from blunt force injuries			0

@entity85 , an experienced sailor who owns the @entity87 - based charter company @entity86 , said the gps chart ‘ gives an important clue if not verification of what happened to the vessel			2
’ ‘ it looked like they plotted a course for @entity71 and @entity96 was directly in the way			0
’ debris : a white seat cushion is seen on a white tarp covering wreckage recovered from a yacht that collided with a larger vessel , on a boat used for a rescue search , seen moored with other boats in @entity71 on sunday participants : yachters and others view lists of race winners posted outside a hotel in @entity71 , @entity30 , @entity31 , yesterday @entity85 , who visited the part of the island where the gps tracking ended , said it was unlikely that the device fell off the boat because the chart shows a steady speed and straight course			1
‘ that section of @entity96 is near vertical and it would be like hitting a wall			0
there 's no beach to stop or slow a vessel , so a vessel would make contact with a near - vertical wall , ’ he said			0
