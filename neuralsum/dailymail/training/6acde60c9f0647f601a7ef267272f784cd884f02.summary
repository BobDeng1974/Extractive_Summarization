by @entity0 the truth is that @entity2 and i never clicked because i was far too outgoing for his liking and i had to rein that in when i was in front of him			1
on the pitch , there were no problems as i gave my all for him , as i would have done for any manager			2
we just never had that special relationship			2
he never really opened up to me , but he ’s not that type of manager			1
he was far more like a schoolteacher - style gaffer you could n’t get close to			0
the man and the boss : @entity0 played under @entity2 at @entity23 between 2007 and 2009 tenure : @entity2 enjoyed a successful stint at @entity26 with @entity23 before going to @entity27 @entity28 it like bullard by @entity0 is published by @entity31 at £ 16.99			1
the @entity33 @entity32 , if you like			0
it was the start of the 2008 - 09 season and my form for @entity23 going back to the start of the year had been recognised by @entity40			1
it was definitely the pinnacle of my career , which is why i would never have believed anyone who would have told me i ’d be a @entity44 player by january			0
but this is football and anything can happen , on and off the pitch			0
things like the future manager of @entity40 playing golf instead of turning up to a meeting with me to discuss the possible extension of my contract			1
having suffered a horrible knee injury , i was worried that the 16 months left on my @entity23 deal would not cover me sufficiently if it should happen again			1
so i asked the club if they would consider giving me a new , longer deal to make me feel more secure			0
i was playing well so i really did n’t envisage any stumbling blocks			0
a meeting was set up between me , my agent @entity61 , @entity2 and the @entity23 chief executive @entity62			1
@entity61 and i met up with the chief exec , but there was no sign of @entity2			1
@entity62 was a bit confused by that and called him , only to find out he was playing golf and would n’t be coming			0
that was the end of that meeting			2
i thought it was bang out of order			1
it does n’t matter if you ’re the chairman , owner or manager , you have to treat people with respect and that ’s pretty much what i told @entity2 the next time i saw him			1
i asked him where he ’d been when we were supposed to have had a meeting and i told him it showed me and my agent a lack of respect			2
perhaps i should n’t have been so hostile , but his decision not to attend that meeting spoke volumes			2
his kit was tight and fitted him perfectly			0
@entity94 became @entity96 club captain and his skipper ’s armband had claret and blue tassles hanging off it , making him look like a warrior			0
socks rolled up perfectly over his permanently shaved , well - oiled legs , he oozed @entity106 class and style			0
he was a real man			0
and he was also an utterly terrifying nutcase			0
pinpoint precision : @entity0 was called up on three occasions following his displays for @entity23 magic moment : @entity0 celebrates avoiding relegation with @entity23 team - mate @entity114 in 2008 @entity28 it like bullard by @entity0 is published by @entity31 at £ 16.99			1

@entity0 played with @entity2 at @entity23 between 2007 and 2009
the *midfielder* *admits* the @entity40 boss never opened up to him
@entity0 thought it was ' out of order ' that @entity2 missed his meeting about a new contract when he had been out with a knee injury
