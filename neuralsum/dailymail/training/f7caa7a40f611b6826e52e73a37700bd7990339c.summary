by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the number of people arriving in the @entity5 from the rest of @entity7 surged by 27 per cent last year , new figures showed today			2
in a major blow for @entity10 on the day of @entity7 elections , the data confirms that net migration into the @entity5 is running at more than twice his target of cutting it to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
the @entity16 said there had been a surge in people coming for work , with the biggest rise amongst people from elsewhere in the @entity23			2
@entity24 leader @entity10 had set a target of bringing net migration to below 100,000 , which now seems almost impossible to meet throughout last year a total of 201,000 @entity23 citizens arrived in the @entity5 , a ‘ statistically significant increase from 158,000 the previous year ’ , the @entity16 said			1
in 2013 a total of 526,000 people moved to the @entity5 and 314,000 left , giving a net migration figure of 212,000			1
this is up from 177,000 in 2012 , and level with the year to the end of september			0
the number of people arriving was up 5 per cent year - on - year , with 43,000 more @entity23 citizens and 11,000 fewer @entity38 citizens arriving			1
among those coming from across @entity7 , 125,000 came to find work , up from 95,000 in 2012			0
in 2013 a total of 526,000 people moved to the @entity5 and 314,000 left , giving a net migration figure of 212,000 there was a dramatic rise in the number of people from @entity46 and @entity47 moving to the @entity5 , even before work restrictions were lifted on january 1 this year			1
a total of 23,000 people travelled from the two countries in 2013 , up from just 9,000 the previous year			2
the largest increases in new registrations for @entity55 numbers - needed to work and claim benefits - were also among citizens of @entity46 - up 29,000 to 47,000			2
other large increases were among people from @entity60 ( up 11,000 to 102,000 ) , @entity61 ( up 9,000 to 42,000 ) and @entity47 ( up 7,000 to 18,000 ) from the previous year some 70 per cent of people from @entity46 and @entity47 arrived for work - related reasons			1
it follows figures last week which showed an estimated 122,000 @entity46 and @entity47 were employed in the @entity5 in the first three months of 2014 , up from 103,000 in the same period in 2013			1
@entity66 , chairman of the @entity67 , said : ' despite the government 's best efforts and repeated commitments to reducing the net migration figure it has remained the same			2
' controlling @entity23 migration is impossible without reform			0
it is clear that their aim is unrealistic and unachievable			0
the government should drop their target now			0
' the flood of immigrants from @entity46 and @entity47 has not arrived and these figures show that they were already in the country			1
' the need for estimates is plainer than ever			0
only by knowing the facts can we ensure that the immigration debate can not be hijacked by those looking to stir up racial tensions			0
' the figures emerging on the day of @entity7 elections are a blow for mr @entity10 , pictured after voting with his wife @entity94 today the issue of immigration has dominated campaigning in the @entity7 elections , with @entity98 seeking to capitalise on public anger to top the polls			2
@entity98 leader @entity101 said today : ' with under a year left to the general election the verdict is clear			0
' @entity10 has broken his solemn promise to the @entity5 people on one of the most important political issues			1
' and he has done so because he refuses to take back control of our borders in respect of more than 400million people from more than two dozen countries on continental @entity7			0
' @entity98 leader @entity101 said the @entity114 had broken their promise to voters @entity24 immigration minister @entity117 said : ' uncontrolled , mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion , puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes			1
' while recent net migration levels remain stable the figures show that it has fallen by a third since its peak in 2005 under the last government and that this government 's reforms have cut net migration from outside the @entity23 to levels not seen since the late 1990s			1
' we are building an immigration system that is fair to @entity5 citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law			0
we want to ensure that people come to the @entity5 for the right reasons - to work hard and contribute to our economy and society			0
' at the weekend mr @entity10 sought to play down the @entity24 pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands			1
the promise in the @entity24 's 2010 manifesto is not official government policy because the @entity152 have always refused to sign up to it			0
challenged about his chances of meeting the target before the 2015 election , mr @entity10 told @entity157 : ' we are working towards it , we are doing everything we can to deliver on it and we should continue to do that			2
' he went on : ' i want to see net migration down to the tens of thousands not only because it is right for the @entity5 economy because we should be training our own people for these jobs			1
' but also if you look back to the 1980s when net migration was in the tens of thousands , we were an open economy then			2
' but do you know what , immigration was n’t a big political issue because it was properly under control and that ’s what i want to achieve again			0
' @entity176 , @entity177 ’s shadow home secretary , said : ' @entity10 and @entity179 's flagship immigration pledge is in shreds			0
' they promised ‘ no ifs , no buts ’ to get their net migration target down to the tens of thousands by the end of the @entity184 , and the actual figure is over twice that			1
' by making such loud promises and failing to meet them , @entity179 and @entity10 have further eroded trust on immigration and undermined confidence in a government ’s ability to address people ’s concerns			0

201,000 @entity23 citizens arrived in the @entity5 in 2013 , up from 158,000 in 2012
net migration stood at 212,000 , double the @entity114 election target
@entity98 *accuse* @entity10 of breaking a ' solemn promise to the @entity5 people '
23,000 arrived from @entity46 and @entity47 , up from just 9,000 in 2012
