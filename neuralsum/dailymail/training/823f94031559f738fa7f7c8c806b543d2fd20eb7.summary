@entity1 's eyes dim when he digs into the memory bank and talks about the look on his parents ’ faces			1
their immediate reaction to the news , he says , was one of the most painful moments of his 12 - month ban for cocaine abuse			1
‘ it ’s quite weird to relive it because i ’ve tried to bury it , ’ said @entity1 , 23 , speaking publicly for the first time since his suspension ended with him playing his first game for his new club @entity16 last weekend			1
‘ my dad is my biggest fan			2
i drove home and told my mum , then waited for my dad to get in from work			2
‘ i broke down a bit			2
when it all falls on top of you , you think , “ i ’ve potentially ruined my life here ”			2
it reduces you to such a low level , you think , “ wow ”			2
i wo n’t forget the look on my dad ’s face when i told him			2
that ’s enough for me to not ever do anything that stupid again			2
’ @entity1 is determined to make the most of his second chance at @entity16 after a year - long drug ban @entity1 made his @entity41 return for the @entity42 last weekend against @entity43 the @entity45 age - group hooker received the results of his positive test on december 19 , 2013 , his 22nd birthday			1
then at @entity49 , @entity1 was called into a meeting after training with club coaching staff and an anti-doping officer , who revealed that benzoylecgonine , a metabolite of cocaine , was present in his results			1
the one - year ban began immediately and @entity49 had no option but to release him			1
‘ it was a test after an @entity61 semi-final , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it was quite a bad time			0
i had my contract terminated on my birthday , then @entity62 was really weird and i was in a bit of a void			0
after @entity62 it dies down a bit and you think , “ i ’ve made a really , really bad mistake ”			0
' you talk about embarrassment but it was more a feeling that i let people down			0
i definitely let my mum and dad down , and my family			0
@entity49 as well ; i let @entity79 [ @entity80 ] and all them guys down			1
’ between the initial drugs test and the start of the suspension , @entity1 had made his first - team debut for the west @entity88 club			1
having played previously for @entity43 and @entity45 under - 18s , his career seemed to be set on an upward trajectory			1
he does not come across as the ‘ party animal ’ type but says he turned to the drug because of ‘ personal issues outside the game ’ , despite being fully aware of the repercussions			1
he will not explain further			0
now 23 , @entity1 took to mixed martial arts during his time away from rugby and says is provided him with focus @entity1 was a fast mover in his 10 months as an @entity103 fighter , reaching a semi-professional level ‘ when i got tested , i knew , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it was out of character for me [ to take drugs ]			0
it was n’t something that appealed to me in any way ; it was just something that happened			0
straight after i knew exactly what i ’d done			0
i beat myself up quite badly			0
it was n’t a habit			0
’ @entity1 headlined a fight night in @entity88 during his exile from professional rugby due to a drugs ban it was the buzz of competition that provided @entity1 with his real highs			1
torn away from his love for rugby with a suspension that did not even permit training , the youngster from @entity120 took up mixed martial arts			1
former @entity45 prop @entity126 , who previously served a two - year ban for cocaine use , started @entity130 jiu - jitsu during his time out but @entity1 found comfort in cage fighting			1
he said : ‘ the @entity103 gave me something to focus on			1
some people may go missing and take loads of time off but i knew from the start that i made a mistake and needed to keep my head right			0
it was hard , a dark place			0
‘ there ’s a lot more to @entity103 than just being a man , hitting people hard and having a fight			0
i was n’t too bad , considering 10 months in i got to the semi-pro level			0
' i fought for a light - heavyweight title			1
i lost by a split decision but it was important to me , just to really bring home that i really went for something that year			1
i never sat there and felt sorry for myself			0
’ while @entity1 was banned for the recreational drug use , he questions claims that rugby ’s culture encourages the use of performance enhancing substances			1
there is increasing pressure on young players to bulk up to meet the physical demands of the game but @entity1 ’s perception is that sufficient levels of education are in place			1
‘ everyone is getting bigger and stronger but there are teams in place to help you achieve that naturally , ’ he said			0
‘ the people who do that [ take drugs ] are the people who do n’t want to work hard and want to take short cuts			0
’ @entity1 poses for his @entity49 portrait in august 2013 - three months later his career was in turmoil a talented teenagers , @entity1 is tackled during an @entity45 under - 18s match against @entity185 in 2009 cage fighting kept @entity1 in shape and he was given a lucky break by @entity16			1

‘ i got a phone call from [ former lock ] @entity197 , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ he said , “ we ’re short on hookers , do you fancy coming and playing an @entity61 game for us ? ”			0
i jumped at the chance			2
my ban was up on the saturday and i was back playing at a very good standard on the monday			2
‘ before that i was looking at playing @entity207 for @entity208 or something along those lines			0
i was prepared to start at the bottom and work my way up			0
’ @entity16 found themselves with extensive injury problems and signed @entity1 on a week - by - week contract			1
he says he was treated like any other member of the squad on his return , with his new team - mates recognising the willingness to own up to his mistakes			2
now he feels he is back on the right path			0
‘ i want to be a @entity41 hooker and all the dreams i had as a kid are very much on my mind , ’ he said			2
‘ perhaps before i lost that hunger , but now i ’ve got that hunger to do what i need to do			0
