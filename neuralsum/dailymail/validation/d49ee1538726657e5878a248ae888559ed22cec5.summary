a terrified woman who knew her sister - in - law had been murdered by their mother - in - law kept quiet about the crime for seven years because she was scared she would suffer the same fate			1
@entity6 eventually found the courage to speak out about the so - called ' honour killing ' and bring her murderous mother - in - law to justice			1
now she has shared her story with the @entity12 show @entity14 's @entity13 as she hopes her experience will encourage other victims trapped in violent marriages to speak out			1
she said she had no say in the decision and had huge reservations about her new family			0
' i felt like i was being pressured and i had to think about my parents as well			0
i did n't want to let them down and i had to think about the honour or the shame i would bring to the family if i had said no. ' so , i accepted what was being offered and i said yes , and went ahead with it , ' she explains			0
@entity6 struggled to settle into her new home where her mother - in - law @entity43 ruled the roost			1
' honour killing ' : @entity6 , left , on her wedding day with her sister - in - law @entity48 who was murdered by their mother - in - law and her husband when she tried to get a divorce but she did find companionship in her new sister - in - law @entity56 , 18 , who was married to her husband 's brother , @entity58			1
both @entity48 and @entity6 were made to feel worthless and their lives were no longer their own			2
@entity6 said : ' my role in the family after i got married was to cook and clean , take care of the family , take care of the extended family if they were coming round , cooking and cleaning and then accompanying our mother - in - law to other occasions			1
she was constantly in charge , and she did rule the house and she would tell us what to do instead of discussing it with us			0
' when @entity48 and @entity6 both had children , their mother - in - law took over their upbringing as well			1
@entity6 recalls : ' there were times where we breastfeeding and she would look at us and she would say , " ‘ the babies are not happy			2
maybe we should put them on the bottle			0
" ' when we were out one day , i rushed home to feed my baby , and the baby was sleeping			0
i was going to wake her up and feed her , and she said , " oh , i 've already fed her			0
" ' that was really shocking for me			0
i really felt upset thinking , even that right has been taken away from me			0
' while @entity6 felt powerless , her sister - in - law @entity48 started rebelling against their treatment			1
she cut her hair , started wearing make - up and made new friends she started going out drinking with			0
her husband and mother - in - law started beating her because they said such behaviour brought them shame - but @entity48 remained defiant			1
she then told @entity58 that she intended to leave him and wanted a divorce			2
upon hearing this , @entity6 said their mother - in - law was enraged and told her , ' your sister will have divorce over my dead body			1
' @entity6 did n't realise quite how far @entity43 would go to stop her daughter - in - law leaving her son until it was too late			1
murderous matriarch : @entity43 was jailed for life in 2007 for her part in @entity48 's death @entity43 arranged for @entity48 to go to @entity121 with her - but the young women never returned from the trip			1
@entity6 said her sister - in - law had only gone because @entity43 tricked her			1
she explains : ' my mother - in - law spoke to @entity48 and said , " before you have your divorce i want you to come to a family trip to @entity121 with me			1
i did n't want to go on my own , just come with me and meet the family out there			0
do your duty as a daughter - in - law and then when you come back you can have your divorce			1
" ' when @entity43 returned from the two - week trip without @entity48 , she and @entity58 told @entity48 's two children that their mother had run away and left them because she did n't love them			1
@entity6 knew her sister - in - law would never do such a thing and confronted her mother - in - law			1
' i kept saying , " where 's @entity48 ? " she would n't speak at first			2
then all of a sudden the power came back into her voice and she became that strong dominating woman again			0
she looked at me and said , " @entity48 's been taken care of			2
" ' she told me , " @entity48 was driven out in a jeep and @entity48 was drugged , strangled and her body was thrown in the river			1
" ' @entity6 was shocked and horrified by the confession but she was too scared to go to the police and tell them what @entity43 had told her			1
she now knew what her mother - in - law was capable of and was scared she or her children could be her next victim			1
she said : ' my normality was terror			0
a woman i once called my mum , she was actually a murderer			0
' for years , @entity6 continued to live in fear and silence while @entity48 's family tried to find out what happened to her			1
@entity166 @entity165 , a senior investigator at the @entity167 , took on the case after @entity48 was reported missing by her family			2
but for years the case remained unsolved due to a lack of leads and no body			0
@entity6 today , left , and right as a scared young bride forced into an arrange marriage at the age of 19 it 's only when @entity6 finally realised that she must tell the truth that justice is served			2
after telling her parents what she knew , they arranged for her to meet @entity186			0
with the information @entity6 supplied , he travelled to @entity188 in @entity121 to try to find more evidence , advising @entity190 to sit tight and not let @entity43 and @entity191 know the police are on to them			2
thanks to the people he met in @entity121 , who remembered @entity48 's visit , and how her mother - in - law and husband tried to cover their tracks after her disappearance , he is finally able to piece together a picture of what happened to @entity48			1
he said : ' it is my view that @entity48 was tricked into thinking she was going shopping			2
along the way she was driven to an area close to the river			0
her gold was removed from her			0
she was then thrown into the @entity212			0
' as the case grew stronger it was reported in the local press that the police had information that would soon lead to arrests			0
@entity43 and @entity191 realise their crime could soon be discovered and @entity6 could give evidence against them			2
so they decide to get rid of her too			0
@entity6 reveals she was chilled to the bone when her mother - in - law told her , ' we 're going to take a trip to @entity121 '			1
the mother has now trained as @entity228 as she wants to help others in need ' i realised that i had to get out , ' @entity6 said she she fled to @entity186 and urged him to arrest @entity43 , and @entity58 right away			1
in april 2007 , the pair , then aged 70 and 43 , were found guilty of murder following a long trial at @entity236 , @entity237 , and jailed for life			2
@entity6 said : ' after nine years we finally got justice			2
' now trying to rebuild her own life , @entity6 lives with her children and has qualified as a pcso as she wants to help the police stop similar cases happening again			2
she added : ' i want to set up my own charity and help other victims of similar situations , because i do n't want them to go through what i did			0
' i want to give the support and courage and help them get their voices to the police and seek justice			0
i know it 's going to take time to get that but i 've got to hope i can			0
' @entity14 's @entity13 continues on sunday nights at 9pm only on @entity12 and is repeated on wednesday ’s at 9pm			0
