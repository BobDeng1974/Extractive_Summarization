the inquest , which was attended by more than a dozen relatives , heard that mrs @entity2 had suffered three blackouts in the two years before her death and had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism , also known as an underactive thyroid gland , in may , 2012			1
the condition causes body functions , in particular the beating of the heart , to slow down and can lead to dizzy spells or blackouts as the heart struggles to pump enough oxygenated blood around the body and to the brain			0
mrs @entity2 was prescribed medication to combat the effects of the condition but a toxicology report did not find the drug in her system at the time of her death			1
