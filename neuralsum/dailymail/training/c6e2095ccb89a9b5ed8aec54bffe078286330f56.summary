by @entity0 published : 16:11 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 9 september 2013 when @entity2 started coughing and wheezing one summer , she immediately recognised the symptoms			1
like an estimated ten million @entity4 , she suffers from seasonal hay fever and this time felt no different			1
' usually i cough up phlegm , my nose runs and i tend to get chesty and wheezy - typical hay fever symptoms , ' says @entity2 , 53 , from @entity11 , @entity12			1
' i had these symptoms for a few months , but i thought nothing of it : it seemed the same as the previous three years i 'd had hay fever			1
' yet unbeknown to @entity2 , she was actually displaying early signs of lung cancer			1
' i thought nothing of it ' : like ten million @entity4 , @entity2 suffers from seasonal hay fever , so when she started coughing and wheezing , she assumed that was the cause of her symptoms although it is the second most common cancer in the @entity4 , with 35,000 cases a year , many people are unaware of the symptoms so it is caught too late , says dr @entity30 , a consultant oncologist from @entity31			1
as a result , just 9 per cent of patients survive for five or more years after diagnosis , making it the most common cause of cancer death for men and women in the @entity4			1
but it can be a hard disease to spot , adds dr @entity30 , who also works at the @entity44			1
the early signs can be subtle or attributed to other conditions , leading many people to assume they are down to allergies , colds and flu			0
this point is echoed by @entity52 , national clinical director for cancer at @entity55			1
' a number of people are generally unaware of the potential symptoms of lung cancer , or associate a persistent cough with the seasons - hay fever , allergies or winter coughs and colds			1
this can often result in people delaying a visit to their gp , which could be the difference between receiving an early or late diagnosis			1
' but it 's the duration of symptoms that sets colds and hay fever apart from lung cancer , explains dr @entity30			1
' hay fever happens in bouts , can vary from day to day and should be eased with antihistamines			0
but lung cancer symptoms do n't disappear after a few weeks , and progressively get worse			1
' mistaken illness : the symptoms of lung cancer can be tricky to spot - many assume they are a result of allergies , cold and flu lung cancer is most common among the over- 50s , but the biggest increase in the past four years is in the over- 75s due to the ageing population , says mr @entity52			1
there are also around 10 per cent more cases in the under - 40s compared with ten years ago			0
dr @entity30 says the youngest case he has seen has been in a 23 - year - old			0
it is thought it is becoming more obvious in women because rates of men smoking are declining faster			0
in 1948 , 65 per cent of men smoked , compared with 41 per cent of women			0
now , 20 per cent of women smoke , compared with 21 per cent of men			0
evidence has also shown that women are more prone to a particular type of lung cancer , driven by a genetic defect			1
this type of cancer is called an adenocarcinoma , and scientists are unsure why women are more at risk , although it may be linked to hormones			2
scientists from the @entity110 , @entity111 , found there was a slightly increased risk ( less than 5 per cent ) of lung cancer for women on @entity116 , so it 's thought the female sex hormone oestrogen may play a role , but more research is needed			1
the most common symptoms of lung cancer are a cough lasting three weeks or more , loss of appetite and weight loss , tiredness , breathlessness and chest pain			1
yet people are often reluctant to bother their doctor with these symptoms , says mr @entity52 , which could be contributing to the high death rates from the disease			2
' compared with other @entity137 countries ' survival rates , @entity55 significantly lags behind because over two thirds of patients are diagnosed at a late stage , ' says mr @entity52			2
' by this point , curative treatment is often no longer viable			0
some people might not want to bother their doctor , but please do - it 's always best to be sure			2
' but there are other , more surprising , symptoms of lung cancer that patients often miss , says dr @entity30			1
one of these is rounded ' clubbed ' fingernails , which occur in one case in ten			0
no one knows exactly why , but this symptom can be seen in conditions where there is a lack of oxygen getting into the body , such as congenital heart defects			0
more often , though , it is a sign of lung problems			2
typically , nails feel spongy and look curved			0
the ends of the fingertips appear swollen and are often slightly blue in colour			0
' they look a bit like matchsticks , ' says dr @entity30			0
' compared with other @entity137 countries ' survival rates , @entity55 significantly lags behind because over two thirds of patients are diagnosed at a late stage			2
' ' for some patients , lung cancer is diagnosed only after a doctor notices their nails and sends them for an x-ray , although it 's usually one of many symptoms			1
however , not all doctors are aware it 's a sign			2
' @entity2 developed clubbed fingertips and nails around five months after first getting her ' hay fever ' symptoms , but she noticed them only when a chiropractor , whom she had visited for an unconnected back complaint , remarked on them and advised her to see her doctor			2
she had seen her gp previously , as she had started to feel incredibly tired			0
she was diagnosed with borderline anaemia and given iron pills , but these did n't ease her exhaustion			0
on seeing her fingernails , however , her doctor sent her for a chest x-ray because he knew they could be linked to lung problems			2
@entity2 was horrified when this showed a tumour on her right lung , and further tests confirmed cancer			1
the tumour was removed and fortunately the cancer had n't spread			2
@entity2 had a short course of chemotherapy and was given the all - clear five years later			0
@entity2 was lucky , but dr @entity30 says that in other patients the symptoms are missed			2
apart from clubbed fingernails , other surprising symptoms include pain in the shoulder and weakness or numbness in the hand			1
this occurs in around 10 per cent of lung cancer cases , when the tumour grows at the top of the lung			1
when it expands , it presses on the nerves running through the shoulder			0
' people go to their doctor with shoulder , wrist and arm problems that they 've tried a few things for but the pain has n't gone after a couple of weeks , ' says dr @entity30			0
' the gp sends them for a chest x-ray and finds something at the top of the lung			2
' however , he stresses that pains such as these are usually due to arthritis or muscle strain			0
dr @entity30 adds it 's also important to take note when a chest infection does not clear up after a course of antibiotics , as many gps prescribe three of four courses before sending a patient for a chest x-ray			2
surprise symptom : rounded ' clubbed ' fingernails are a sign of lung problems ; this patient 's nicotine - stained finger exhibits the condition ' gps can be hesitant to send people for x-rays , for example someone who is coughing up blood but is young and seems otherwise fit			1
but they do n't cost much - about Â£ 40			0
' it can also be due to lack of awareness			0
symptoms are often put down to hay fever , chest infections and bronchitis before lung cancer is considered			1
' non-smokers should not assume they are not at risk , he adds			0
although smoking is the biggest risk factor ( @entity2 had smoked for 26 years , but gave up when her cancer was diagnosed ) , one case in five occurs in non-smokers			2
this is thought to be largely due to other environmental factors			0
these include second - hand smoke , air pollution and exposure to asbestos			0
for smokers , the risk of lung cancer drops significantly five to ten years after quitting , although it stays higher than in a non-smoker			1
@entity2 is glad she saw her doctor when she did			0
' since my diagnosis at 44 , i 've looked at life differently , ' she says			0
' i try to be less stressed , have more fun and be positive			0
when you go through cancer , you realise what 's important			1

lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the @entity4
even so , it 's often caught late because it is tricky to spot
symptoms include a lasting cough , loss of appetite , and breathlessness
