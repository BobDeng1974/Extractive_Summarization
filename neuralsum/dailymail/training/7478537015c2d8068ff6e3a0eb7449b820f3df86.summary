by @entity0 published : 13:07 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 13:23 est , 2 august 2012 out of exile : former @entity3 tycoon @entity2 said he wanted to return to the @entity4 to face trial for allegedly defrauding the company out of £ 150million because of a ' burning sense of injustice ' a ' burning sense of injustice ' persuaded fugitive tycoon @entity2 to voluntarily return to the @entity4 after 17 years on the run , a court heard today			1
the 70 - year - old former chairman and chief executive wanted a jury to hear he was ' not guilty ' of stealing nearly £ 150million from his @entity19 ( @entity18 ) business empire , it was said			1
the £ 2billion company , which included households names such as @entity22 , @entity24 kitchen appliances and @entity26 hifi company @entity25 , suddenly collapsed in 1990 with debts of £ 550million			2
it is alleged he had ' abused ' his position of power to help himself to millions of pounds , siphoning off funds from some of the 200 @entity18 subsidiaries he owned to overseas companies and banks under his control			0
@entity2 transferred the money to companies in @entity43 , the @entity44 and elsewhere before depositing it in a bank he owned in @entity47 to bankroll himself , his family and associates between 1987 and 1990 , it was claimed			1
but in september of that year the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) obtained a warrant to search @entity18 offices and the share prices plummeted			0
within months , @entity18 had been placed into administration and while awaiting trial in the early 1990s , @entity2 fled to his native @entity47 in 1993			1
he only returned 18 months ago and has stood trial from the beginning of january of this year			1
after sitting for 123 days and hearing evidence from 94 witnesses , @entity2 ’s barrister @entity56 addressed the jury as he concluded his closing speech			1
he said : ' one day he ’s got £ 400million of shares , the star of the @entity63			0
his company is one of the stars of the @entity63			0
he has got developments all over the world			0
' but the next day all of it is doomed			0
mr @entity2 is full of rage about the fact that a warrant was obtained without investigation as to who owns those companies in @entity43			2
' facing justice : @entity2 and his wife @entity77 arrive at the @entity78 in @entity79 in january to stand trial on 13 counts of theft between 1987 and 1990 in the dock : @entity2 is accused of abusing his position of power to siphon off millions from @entity3 , which he used to fund himself , his family and his associates he said that if a proper investigation had been undertaken the @entity48 would have realised the companies in @entity43 and elsewhere were owned by @entity18			1
@entity2 had allegedly raised emergency loans from the @entity92 government , but @entity18 directors had been ' intimidated ' into winding it up and ' it was too late and they would not change their mind			2
' the jury were told @entity2 was arrested as he flew in with the @entity92 offer , quizzed and then charged without what he claims was any investigation			1
over the next couple of years , 60 other counts were added , @entity2 was unable to travel to @entity47 to get evidence , he was made bankrupt and could not hire lawyers			1
the jury were told all @entity2 ’s papers were seized after the bankruptcy as part of a civil claim and an injunction to intercept and open his post was obtained			2
facing the media : @entity2 arrives at his @entity79 home in august 2010 after 17 years on the run in northern @entity47 because he feared he would not get a fair trial back in the @entity4 : the fugitive tycoon walks off a plane with his wife in august 2010 after returning from @entity47 then allegations of attempts to bribe the judge emerged with @entity2 and his qc at the centre , ' although there was nothing to substantiate this			1
' mr @entity127 added @entity2 ' cracked and left ' because he feared he would not get a fair trial especially as the case controller @entity130 had lied to the attorney general who then had inadvertently misled @entity132			1
it was only 18 months ago @entity2 felt he could get a fair trial and would be granted bail - and ' as soon as he got that he came back			1
' he said : ' perhaps the most important thing is that he came back			0
why , in his 70s , living , you may think , at a very pleasant place where no - one can touch him , what would persuade a man that suffered these blows to return ? ' he told you he wanted to come back			2
what persuaded a man who is 70 to offer himself up to be tried			0
on the run : nadir at his home in nothern @entity47 in july 1993			2
@entity2 ' cracked and left ' the @entity4 after allegations of attempts to bribe the judge in the original trial emerged relaxed : @entity2 's barrister questioned in his closing remarks to the jury why @entity2 would leave his @entity157 safe haven other than to protest his innocence ' it ’s the burning sense of injustice			1
although he could have lived his life out in peace , he could not live with the sense of injustice			1
' the only reason he came back is because he is not guilty and determined a jury should hear that and he should hear that from a jury			2
' in summing up the case , mr @entity169 said : ' the defendant admitted all the money left @entity18 and passed by various routes to end usage that did not benefit @entity18 in any way			0
' the prosecution allege all these transfers were theft of @entity18 property			0
he dishonestly took what he knew to be @entity18 property and used it for his own benefit or benefit of his own family or associates			0
' as a result of @entity2 ’s activities , @entity18 suffered a loss of around £ 150million			2
he denies he did anything dishonest and said @entity18 did not lose anything			0
' the jury were reminded @entity2 claimed any transfers of funds from @entity18 's @entity79 bank accounts were ' preceded by deposits of the equivalent or greater sums in @entity198 ' in northern @entity47			1
' the effect of that deposit of @entity198 by the time the transfers were made in @entity79 , the funds that were being transferred were no longer @entity18 property , ' mr @entity169 said			0
@entity2 was arguing there was a balance of payment			0
@entity2 is charged with 13 ' sample ' counts of theft of £ 33.1million and $ 2.5million which date back to 1990			1
the court heard investigators found the total stolen in 64 identified transfers , including the 13 transfers which form the charges against him , amounted to £ 146,050,000 and $ 6,424,724			0
