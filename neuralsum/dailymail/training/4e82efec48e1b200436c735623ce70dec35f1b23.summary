mystery : this photograph by @entity9 shows a mysterious flash of light in the top left - hand corner ' i uploaded the photos to my laptop and had decided to delete the picture because of the apparent sunspot over part of the image , ' he said			1
' but just as i was about to press delete i noticed the image on the left of the photograph of what i thought was either an aircraft or the sun shining through the clouds			2
' something which had not been apparent when i took the photo			2
i enlarged the photo the best i could and was intrigued by what i saw			0
' mr @entity9 has since been puzzling over the identity of the @entity5 , which he initially thought was the result of a problem with his camera			0
