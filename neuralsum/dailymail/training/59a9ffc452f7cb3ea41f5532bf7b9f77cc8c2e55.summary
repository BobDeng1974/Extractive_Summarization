by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 became the third quickest @entity3 man over 100 metres in history by running 9.96secs in @entity6 , @entity7 , on sunday			1
the 20 - year - old @entity9 junior champion took 21 hundredths of a second off his lifetime legal best to set a new @entity3 under - 23 record and become only the fifth @entity3 athlete to break the 10 - second barrier			1
@entity1 finished second in @entity6 behind @entity16 of @entity17 , who ran 9.95secs , but his stunning performance has set up an fascinating battle between the country ’s best male sprinters at this month ’s @entity23 in @entity24			1
sprint : @entity1 ( left ) became the third fastest briton over 100m as he recorded a time of 9.96secs champion : @entity1 is the @entity30 champion after wining in @entity31 last year @entity33 ran 9.91secs at last year ’s trials , veteran @entity32 has recorded 10.06secs and 20 - year - old @entity37 has clocked 10.07secs already this season , while @entity40 became the world indoor champion over 60m earlier this year			1
@entity1 ’s breakthrough performance , however , has probably come too late for the sprinter to be included in @entity46 ’s team for the 100m at the @entity48 in @entity49			1
the squad was due to be released on @entity51 but , although the announcement has been delayed , successful athletes were notified last week			2
@entity1 , who combined athletics with studying applied sciences at college , trains at @entity57 in north @entity58 with long jumper @entity59 and talented young @entity3 sprinters such as @entity62 , 23 , and @entity63 , 22			1
the group work under @entity65 , a rugby and sprints coach and former apprentice of @entity70 ‘ super coach ’ @entity69 , who guided @entity59 to @entity72 gold at @entity73			2
@entity1 said : ' right now i ’m feeling so happy			2
i ’m just over the moon about my performance			2
challengers : @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 will face @entity1 at the @entity3 championships competition : @entity81 champion @entity40 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) will also run in @entity24 ' i knew @entity16 was in form and for me to make him dip i knew that we must have gone fast			1
' before the start i knew there was good conditions , much more cooler than it was for my heats , and i thought : " anything is possible here			0
just try and win the race			0
" and the time came			0
' i came second to @entity16 and he ’s a world class athlete			1
' i did have a feeling this was coming			0
my group has been training well and we are all on form			0
i knew what type of shape i was in when i ran 10.17 in @entity100 three weeks ago			2
' i ’m still in shock , it has n’t sunk in			0
soon i think it will sink in			0
' i ’ve been getting lots of messages from family and friends and seen it all on @entity110 , it makes me happy			0
' i just want to take one step at a time			0
there is still more work to do			0
' pedigree : @entity72 triple jump champion @entity59 also trains at @entity57 with @entity1			1

@entity1 ran 9.96secs to finish second behind @entity17 @entity16
the 20 - year - old took 21 hundreths of a second off his lifetime best
the @entity9 junior champion is only the fifth @entity3 athlete under *10secs*
will face @entity33 , @entity37 , @entity32 and @entity40 at the @entity23 in @entity24 this month
he is unlikely to make @entity46 *'s* @entity48 squad , however
