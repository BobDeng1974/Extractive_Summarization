detectives investigating suspected terrorists and paedophiles will have the power to force internet companies to hand over details of computer - users under new laws being introduced by home secretary @entity8			1
the move is the latest round in a power battle between mrs may and deputy prime minister @entity13 over the so - called ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ , which would greatly increase the power of the police and intelligence services to monitor communications between suspects			1
last night , mrs may said the move would boost national security , but complained that mr @entity13 was still blocking her from taking further vital steps on the grounds of civil liberties			1
under the home secretary ’s plans , to be included in the anti-terrorism and @entity36 , internet service providers will be obliged to help police and @entity40 track suspicious individuals by retaining information that helps them match @entity43 ( ip ) addresses to individual users			1
ip addresses are numbers that identify each device connected to the internet			2
if police seize a computer that has been shared between individuals , they will be able to demand the information that will single out the key suspects			0
it will also allow them to track anyone using websites showing child - abuse images			0
but despite mrs may ’s lobbying , police still can not demand that internet companies tell them which websites were being viewed by suspects			1
the move comes just days after assistant commissioner @entity66 , @entity67 ’s head of counter-terrorism , said the ‘ massively stretched ’ police were forced to rely on old - fashioned methods such as following suspects because the targets were finding it easier to evade electronic monitoring			2
mrs may said : ‘ loss of the capabilities on which we have always relied is the great danger we face			0
@entity78 provides the opportunity to resolve the very real problems that exist around ip resolution and is a step in the right direction towards bridging the overall communications data capability gap			0
but i believe we need to make further changes to the law			0
‘ it is a matter of national security and we must keep on making the case for the @entity90 until we get the changes we need			1
’ internet giants were asked at a @entity92 last month to hand over the personal details of extremists they catch posting offensive material online , such as beheading videos an aide to mr @entity13 said he supported the move on ip addresses , but continued to oppose plans to allow the security services to access records of every website visited by targets and who they communicate with on social media sites			1
the aide also accused mrs may of previously making ‘ deeply misleading ’ claims that the @entity28 had ‘ put children ’s lives at risk ’ by blocking the ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’			2
a @entity28 spokesman said : ‘ it is good news that the @entity116 has finally got round to producing proposals on this after being repeatedly asked by @entity13			2
these can now be agreed and acted on in the upcoming @entity120			0
‘ this is exactly the kind of thing we need to take action on , rather than proposing an unnecessary , unworkable and disproportionate snoopers ’ charter			0
there is absolutely no chance of that illiberal @entity120 coming back under the @entity129 – it ’s dead and buried			0
’ as @entity132 disclosed , internet giants were asked at a @entity92 last month to hand over the personal details – including ip addresses – of extremists they catch posting offensive material online , such as beheading videos .			1
