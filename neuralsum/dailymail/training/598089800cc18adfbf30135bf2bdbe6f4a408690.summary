@entity1 coach @entity0 was left ‘ very disappointed ’ after winger @entity2 was denied a potentially match - winning last - minute try against @entity3 in the @entity4			1
the @entity5 were clinging to a 16 - 12 lead when @entity2 attempted to touch down ahead of full - back @entity7 with 46 seconds left			0
neither @entity2 nor his team - mates initially celebrated and with referee @entity11 not giving a try , his brother @entity13 , the video official , needed ‘ sufficient evidence ’ — according to @entity17 @entity16 rules — to overturn the decision			2
@entity2 had a last - minute try disallowed as @entity3 beat @entity1 16 - 12 in the @entity4 on sunday @entity2 chased down a grubber kick from @entity21 and felt he chased down the ball ahead of @entity23 but the referee consulted his video assistant to rule out the try , denying the visitors a famous win he ruled that @entity2 had failed to find downward pressure , which left @entity3 celebrating a face - saving victory at @entity32 ’s @entity31			1
@entity3 ( 4 ) 16 tries : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity7 , goals : @entity37 ( 2 ) @entity1 ( 12 ) 12 tries : @entity39 , @entity2 goals : @entity41 ( 2 ) @entity0 believes the try should have been awarded and told the @entity43 : ‘ i thought it was a try but we probably need to have a lot closer look at that			1
it looks like his fingers are on the ball when the ball hit the ground so we are very disappointed			0
’ @entity2 admitted he was unsure whether he had scored , adding : ‘ i knew i ’d got something on it but i was n’t sure whether i grounded it or not , so i did n’t want to make a big fuss about it because we wanted the ball back at least			2
‘ someone said that if it was @entity66 rules , that would have been a try , but we ’re not in @entity66 are we ? ’ @entity3 coach @entity68 felt the right decision was made			2
‘ had it been a try i think @entity2 would have been celebrating , but he was n’t , ’ he said			0
‘ they all went back for a line drop - out so i think we got the right decision			0
’ @entity1 must now beat @entity75 in their next game to have any chance of winning the @entity4 a try from @entity7 put @entity3 in command at the @entity31 in @entity32 @entity2 was in sublime form for @entity1 and scored a try of his own earlier on but it was not enough the defeat leaves @entity1 two points behind @entity75 and level with @entity3 , but they will secure a place in the @entity88 final on november 15 — and a potential rematch with the @entity5 — if they win by more than 10 points in @entity91 on saturday			1
it will be the first meeting between the sides since @entity94 broke @entity1 hearts with a try 20 seconds from time in last year ’s @entity97 semi-final at @entity98			0
sunday 's game turned on the second - half introduction of half - back @entity35 as @entity3 , who opened the scoring with @entity34 ’ 17th - minute try , hit back with two tries in seven minutes			1
@entity35 touched down captain @entity37 ’s grubber kick within two minutes of coming on for his debut and @entity7 went over to restore his side ’s lead			1
@entity1 face an anxious wait to hear if two key forwards will be available after being placed on report			0
a match review panel will today examine an alleged trip by @entity115 and a potential ‘ chicken wing ’ tackle by @entity21			0
@entity1 players celebrate with @entity39 after he went over to score @entity7 was a danger man for the @entity5 and here needed two men to stop him @entity121 of @entity1 is upended by @entity122 of @entity3 during the match @entity3 also missed a glorious opportunity late in the first half when @entity34 got past @entity39 but failed to find his winger with the final pass and @entity1 enjoyed another slice of fortune when @entity7 was denied a try on 46 minutes for an obstruction			1
@entity41 and @entity132 then combined to bring down @entity7 just short of the line but the game was blown wide open in the next play when debutant @entity35 grabbed a try two minutes after entering the action , touching down @entity37 's grubber kick on the last tackle			2
this time @entity37 added the goal to cut the deficit to just two points and the @entity5 were back in front six minutes later when @entity35 and @entity37 combined to get @entity143 into a hole and @entity7 was on his inside to touch down for his 25th try for his country			0
@entity37 's second goal made it 16 - 12 and that 's the way it stayed despite @entity2 's last - minute heroics			0
the @entity1 players line - up to sing the national anthem on sunday it is still unlikely that @entity3 will win the tournament , needing to beat @entity156 and hoping @entity75 lose			1

@entity2 chased down grubber kick from @entity21 in last minute
felt he beat @entity23 but referee consulted video assistant to rule it out
@entity2 had earlier scored a try for the visitors along with @entity39
@entity34 , @entity35 and @entity23 go over for @entity3
@entity1 now need to beat @entity75 to have chance of @entity4 wi
