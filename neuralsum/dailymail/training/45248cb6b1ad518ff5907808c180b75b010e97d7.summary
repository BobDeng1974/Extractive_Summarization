as the brutal drug war which has claimed over 80,000 lives still rages , one anonymous blogger has been providing @entity3 with something they ca n't get elsewhere - an inside view of their country 's debilitating narcotics battle			1
with over three million hits a week and over 120,000 followers on @entity13 , @entity10 is renowned for its fearless coverage at a time when mainstream media are feeling pressure and are frightened away by the nation 's deadly cartels			1
the identity of the courageous reporter , who lives under the constant and real fear of a violent and gruesome death , has long been a mystery , as many postings include graphic imagery and depict crime scenes accessible only to military or the police			1
an anonymous , twentysomething blogger is giving @entity3 what they ca n't get elsewhere ¿ an inside view of their country 's raging drug war writing what no one else dares to : the fearless blogger refuses to bow to the violent threats from the cartel however , a new investigation by the @entity42 has revealed that , in fact , the author is a young , single woman in her twenties , with no children and only a deep love of her country and the belief that her blog helps draw back the veil on her nations vicious fight against drug barons			1
' i do n't think people ever imagined it was a woman doing this , ' said the blogger to @entity61 who works for the @entity63 newspaper @entity62 in @entity64			2
' who am i ? i 'm in my mid- 20s , i live in northern @entity3 , i 'm a journalist			1
i 'm a woman , i 'm single , i have no children			2
' this marks the first time that the blogger , who decided to use the pseudonym @entity71 , has spoken to the press			1
in the past she has used a male colleague who helps her with the technical side to engage with short email conversations with reporters			0
speaking through an anonymous intermediary , @entity71 told @entity62 that she uses her blog to keep her compatriots informed of what is really going on between the cartels , the police , the military and the public			1
' i 'm in love with my culture , with my country , despite all that 's going on			0
because we 're not all bad			0
we 're not all narcos			0
we 're not all corrupt			0
we 're not all murderers			0
we are well educated , even if many ( foreign ) people think otherwise			0
' the undifferentiated content suggests that all sides are using the blog — drug gangs to project their power , law enforcement to show that it too can play rough , and the public to learn about incidents that the mainstream media are forced to ignore or play down			2
operating from behind a thick curtain of computer security , @entity10 is @entity3 's go - to internet site at a time when mainstream media are feeling pressure and threats to stay away from the story many postings , including warnings and a beheading , appear to come directly from drug traffickers			1
others depict crime scenes accessible only to military or police since the blog was launched in 2010 , @entity71 has lived in constant fear of being captured and killed by the cartels , who are infuriated by her insistence of depicting the true horrors of the drug war which has been estimated to have displaced over a million people across @entity3			1
she brings up the sad example of a couple who were found hanging from a bridge in the @entity3 border city of @entity132 after being disemboweled and mutilated by their attackers			1
@entity71 revealed to @entity62 that the couple were her erstwhile colleagues on the website			1
' they used to send us photographs			0
that was very hard , very painful			0
' the motive for the gruesome attack was to explicitly warn her not to criticize @entity3 drug cartels on the internet			1
next to the battered bodies was a sign reading : ‘ this is going to happen to all those posting funny things on the internet , you better ( expletive ) pay attention			0
i ’m about to get you			0
’ the woman , thought to be in her 20s , was tied to the bridge from her feet and hands as her body dangled topless with her innards protruding			2
the undifferentiated content suggests that all sides are using the blog ¿ drug gangs to project their power , law enforcement to show that it too can play rough the violence has made @entity3 one of the world 's most dangerous countries for journalists , which explains why @entity10 cloaks itself so heavily in anonymity the man ’s body , also believed to be in his early 20s , was hanging from just his hands			1
however , despite living with the all - too real threat of assassination , @entity71 has now produced a book , ' dying for the truth : @entity182 's @entity181 '			1
it highlights her first year operating the blog during a year in which almost 20,000 people lost their lives			1
over the past three years , @entity71 has had to move home every month to live in basements , running scared from cartel members so powerful they hold corrupt politicians in their pockets			1
indeed , the website comes under constant cyber-attack from members of the government who want to shut down the gruesome but truthful site			2
drawing their material from members of the public , those who she knows and even drug gangs , @entity71 told @entity62 that only her close family know that she is the author behind the infamous blog			1
the mainstream @entity3 media frequently attacks the site , calling it free publicity for the wealthy cartels			1
in at least one case @entity10 may have led to a major arrest ¿ of a prison warden after a video posting detailed her alleged system of setting inmates free at night to carry out killings for a drug cartel in the past the blog has provided links to @entity219 pages of alleged traffickers and their children , weapons , cars and lavish parties , as well as photos of @entity3 pop music stars at a birthday party for an alleged drug dealer 's teenage daughter in the border state of @entity231 , across from @entity232			1
' the girl wrote to me and told me , in a threatening way , to take down her photos , ' said her male colleague to the @entity238 in 2010			0
' but as long as i do n't hear from her father , i wo n't take them down			0
' but , the blog provides @entity3 with an inside view into the world of the @entity244 and the battling @entity246 and @entity247 cartels			1
with president due in @entity3 in early may to discuss the nation 's drug battle with new @entity3 president @entity251 , @entity71 is adamant she will not cease her activities			1
another fearless woman who took on the country 's ravaged violence was @entity256			1
she was elected mayor of @entity258 in 2008 and served until 2011			0
hailed as a heroine of the 21st century , she defied @entity3 's powerful drug gangs and threats on her life by declaring war on @entity3 's organised crime			1
immediately , she received threats			0
the first assassination attempt came in october 2009 when the car she was travelling in with her first husband @entity268 came under fire from gunmen in the town of @entity272			0
the attack claimed his life but @entity256 lived			2
the next attempt on her life was just three months later , when an masked group carrying assault rifles ambushed her on the road between @entity279 and @entity281 state			2
the van she was traveling in was peppered by 30 bullets			0
this time her wounds were more severe , leaving multiple scars and forcing her to wear a colostomy bag			0
she was left in constant pain			0
but with unimaginable courage – and despite being a marked woman – she remained defiant to the very end			2
finally , she was ambushed by a car in the city of @entity293 as she drove her daughter to school in november last year			0
the 36 - year - old was hauled from her vehicle and physically assaulted before getting into her abductors ' car , according to newspaper @entity300			2
for the next week , her frantic family waited by the phone for a ransom call that never came			0
@entity256 ’s body – stabbed , burned , battered and bound at wrist and ankle – was finally found eight days on dumped by a roadside in @entity308 , @entity309			0
' we have thought about quitting the blog thousands of times			2
but we have n't , because we have to get the message out			0
they have stolen our tranquility , our dreams , our peace , ' she said to @entity62			0
telling the newspaper that she knows the revelation she is a girl will stun @entity3 , her devotion to her blog is admirable as she vowed to continue it - no matter the cost			1
' my only boyfriend is the blog			1
a whole phase of my life – boyfriends , going to parties , hanging out with friends – i 've missed it			2
' getting married , having babies – there 's not been time to think of any of that , ' she said to @entity62			0
@entity3 has been ravaged by violence for years			1
in 2003 a land dispute between the @entity344 and @entity247 cartels that set off a wave of violence that has left thousands dead and spread brutal violence across @entity3			1
that year , then - @entity247 cartel leader @entity348 was arrested and accused drug lord @entity349 " @entity350 , sensing weakness , tried to move in on @entity352 , unleashing a bloody battle			2
the city of tree - covered plazas and hacienda - style restaurants was transformed as the @entity358 , then working as enforcers for the @entity247 cartel , and @entity344 cartel fighters waged battles with guns and grenades in broad daylight			2
killings and police corruption became so brazen that then president @entity368 was forced to send in hundreds of troops and federal agents , and the only man brave enough to take the job of police chief was gunned down hours after he was sworn in			0
the @entity358 won that fight and have since ruled the city with fear , threatening police , reporters and city officials and extorting money from businesses			0
they broke off their alliance with the @entity247 cartel in 2010 , worsening the violence across northeast @entity3			2
but last month , 14 mutilated bodies were found in a vehicle left in the city center			0
some media outlets reported that the @entity244 took responsibility for those bodies and in a message allegedly signed by its leader , @entity350 , said the group was now back in @entity352 ' to clean ' the city			0
more than 50,000 people have been killed since the @entity3 government began a crackdown on narco - trafficking in 2006 .			1
