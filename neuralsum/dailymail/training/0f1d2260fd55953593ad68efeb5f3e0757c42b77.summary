taxi driver @entity6 dialled 999 at 5am as he was finding it hard to breathe			1
but after putting his details into a computer an operator told him he did not need an ambulance			1
taxi driver @entity6 , who was told that he did n't need an ambulance despite saying he found it hard to breathe and living just a mile away from his local ambulance station the 55 - year - old , a former merchant seaman , had been ill for three weeks and had seen five doctors about swelling after a change in his blood pressure medication			1
it has now emerged he did not give the answers that ‘ trigger ’ the need for an ambulance and was told to contact his gp instead			2
@entity26 , 75 , mr @entity6 ’s partner of ten years , said : ‘ i do n’t drive and by this point his stomach was so swollen he could n’t get behind the steering wheel			2
‘ in the end his doctor came out to see us just before 1pm and said he needed to go to hospital			0
they took him in a paramedic car , got him to the [ intensive care ] ward … he never regained consciousness			1
’ mr @entity6 died four days later , on september 1			1
a post-mortem examination found fluid around his body had caused heart failure			0
his family demanded to know why an ambulance had not been sent in the first place , from a station just three minutes from his home in @entity49 , @entity50			1
they were told a computer system had decided neither an ambulance nor immediate hospital admission was necessary			2
the ‘ computer says no ’ catchphrase was coined by comedian @entity57 in the @entity59 ’s @entity58 , in which a worker inputs data and then informs a customer they can not be helped			0

no one seemed to be doing anything about the fluid building up in his body			0
‘ it was then decided by a computer programme run by non-medically trained personnel who listen out for keywords , enter them … and the computer said no. i thought it was like @entity58 … but my dad died and that ’s not acceptable			0
’ he added that an ambulance ‘ would have given him an extra ten to 12 hours of treatment … that could have saved his life , but there ’s no way to know for sure now ’			0

a @entity97 spokesman said : ‘ every time a call is made … a comprehensive triage process is undertaken			0
