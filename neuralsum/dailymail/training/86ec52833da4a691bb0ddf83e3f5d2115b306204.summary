an early dose of pantomime was served up on sunday night as @entity2 and @entity3 accounted for @entity4 and @entity5 in their spirited doubles exhibition at the @entity8			1
hopefully for @entity2 the @entity9 is a long way off but he 'll be well - prepared - and somewhat of a hit - after taking the court with the trio of serve and volley legends			2
his partner @entity3 delivered with racquet throws , remonstrated with the umpire and also showed glimpses of the sublime touch that saw the @entity21 amass 77 singles and 71 doubles titles in his glittering career			2
( from left ) @entity5 , @entity4 , @entity2 and @entity3 delivered a last - minute exhibition ( from bottom left ) @entity3 joins @entity4 and @entity5 to lose a rally with @entity2 at the @entity8 @entity2 laughs throughout the match while @entity3 shows why he 's such a hit on the @entity9 @entity2 drove himself to the arena after getting the call to arms as tournament organisers scrambled to pull together a replacement for the final when @entity36 feared he would be unable to take the court for the season - ending final against @entity38			1
after losing a less than serious singles showdown with @entity38 , the intensity was well and truly extracted from the arena when the doubles began with @entity2 again taking centre stage			1
it was a rare chance for @entity2 's sense of humour to come out on a tennis court where the stakes are usually so high , and his class came to the fore when facing all three of the ageing stars - including @entity3 - on one side of the net for a rally			1
and a young @entity56 tennis star could have been unearthed when @entity5 took a breather and handed his weapon to a ball girl , who dominated a rally before stroking a winner down the middle			0
former @entity64 champion cash mimics a ball boy during their match at the @entity8 @entity68 was among the celebrities who stuck around despite the withdrawl of @entity36 from the final @entity2 is sprayed with champagne as he ends the 2014 season on a light - hearted note @entity3 said he was impressed with @entity2 's doubles skills , despite the light - hearted setting			1
' i think we could have done some damage in doubles , ' said @entity3 of his team - mate			2
' thank you @entity2 for coming out today			0
to the people who stayed , much appreciated			0
' @entity2 paid tribute to his opponents and cohort as his season ended on a far more enjoyable note than the 6 - 0 6 - 1 lesson given to him on thursday night by @entity36 in their final group match			1
' @entity3 is a legend of the game , ' he said			0
' @entity4 is someone ... i followed always when i was growing up and he was really good to me when i joined the tour			0
obviously @entity5 , a former @entity64 champion ... it 's just a pleasure to be on the court with these guys			0
