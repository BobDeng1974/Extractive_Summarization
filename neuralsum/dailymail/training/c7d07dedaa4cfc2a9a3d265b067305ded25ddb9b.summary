a @entity1 mother says she is ' humbled ' by the fact that thousands of people around the world claim she inspired them to vaccinate their children			1
@entity6 wrote a diatribe against vaccine - hesitant parents last week after a hospital said her 15 - day - old son had been exposed to measles as he waited for a check - up on january 27			1
tomorrow a doctor is expected to give @entity14 the all - clear , @entity15 has learned			1
during the tense four - week wait , mrs @entity6 took to @entity17 , slamming ' misinformed ' parents for ' twisting science ' , adding : ' i am angry as hell			1
' the post , which systematically lists and debunks the various myths surrounding vaccinations , has been shared more than 270,000 times since february 10 - and thousands of parents from as far as @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29 have been moved to reassess their stance			1
speaking to @entity15 from her home in @entity32 , @entity33 , mrs @entity6 said : ' it has been quite overwhelming			1
i had to stop reading the messages by the time it passed 200			1
i 've now had thousands			2
furious : @entity40 and her husband @entity41 are furious after being told 15 - day - old @entity14 could have been exposed to measles while waiting for a routine check - up at an @entity33 hospital last month ' people all over the world who were on the fence emailed me saying they saw my post and it made them look at the data for themselves , make an informed decision , and vaccinate their children			1
' i never expected it to go around the world like it did			2
' it was a very upsetting and stressful tome and i think i 'd just kind of had it at that point			2
' mrs @entity6 , a vice-president of marketing at a private school , and her husband , @entity60 , have rebuilt their lives since their five - year - old daughter @entity63 unexpectedly died in her sleep three years ago			1
tests showed she suffered from a rare blood infection			2
describing the ordeal to @entity15 , mrs @entity6 said the phone call from @entity70 about @entity14 was the last straw			1
' we have gone through a lot as a family over the last few years			2
' this was a tipping point where i felt that the responsibility of people had to be addressed			2
' but despite the positive reactions she has had , the fear surrounding vaccinations does not appear to be waning			2
' i have heard so much misinformation over the past few days that it is really frightening			1
' i am talking about celebrities who make connections between vaccinations and autism			2
we need to start being smarter			2
' it is a simple case of education ; talking to the right people such as the family doctor , reading established peer - reviewed sources such as those from the @entity96			1
it 's all about mitigating risk			2
' what would happen in an epidemic ? now it 's measles			1
what about mumps ? polio ? ' after a tense four - week wait , the family will visit a doctor tomorrow to find out if @entity14 is measles free			1
in the post @entity110 wrote : agonizing wait : the family has to wait three more days to hear if @entity14 is infected with the disease further fears : their three - year - old daughter @entity115 only has one @entity118 jab which they hope will protect her ' you think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic ? you are n't , ' she wrote			1
' and you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like			2
' you would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees , begging , begging to get that vaccine into your precious babies			2
' she continued : ' you think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and @entity141 and dancing by candlelight on a full moon ? you are n't			2
' i protect your child			2
by being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves , our fellow man , and our most vulnerable			2
so we vaccinate ourselves and our children			2
' more than 100 people in @entity153 and others in several states and @entity156 have been infected with measles since an outbreak traced to @entity159 was first reported in december			1
a @entity161 statement said that it has been dealing with a large , ongoing multi-state outbreak since the beginning of the year			2
though the vast majority of cases are in @entity153 , 18 states and @entity166 had seen cases as of tuesday			2
@entity170 , @entity153 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity166 have seen patients with measles			1
political figures have weighed in on the issue of vaccination , with president @entity190 saying that there is ' no reason ' for all parents not to have their children immunized			0
the year 2014 saw a record number of measles cases , with 644 patients across 27 states			1
last year had one major outbreak that consisted of 383 cases in the unvaccinated @entity202 community			0
the @entity203 normally sees less than 100 measles cases a year			1
this is my son @entity14 , and he may have measles			1
on february 9th , i received a phone call from @entity70 , informing me that @entity14 , alongside my mother and i , was potentially exposed to the measles virus while attending a newborn weigh - in appointment at my doctor 's office in @entity214 on january 27th			1
@entity14 was 15 days old at the time			1
i was informed that someone who later developed measles sat in the doctor 's waiting room between 1 hour before and 30 minutes before we arrived			1
i was also informed that measles is regarded as ' airborne ' and can stay in the air and on surfaces up to 2 hours after the infected person has left			1
i was then asked if i had had the measles vaccine			1
i was advised to not be around small children			0
if i worked in such an environment i would be written off work			0
i do work in such an environment ; my home			0
where i now sit with @entity14 and my 3 year old , @entity230 , who has only been able to get one @entity118 vaccine so far			1
she is now , technically , exposed too			1
we are to sit tight and watch for symptoms : fever , cough , runny nose			0
if we develop any of these we are to call my doctor and arrange to come in under official medical precautions			0
we are to wait at home , in isolation , until february 17th , after which the 21 days of possible incubation will have passed and we are clear			1
so , @entity14 is now @entity244 's baby			1
simultaneously with measles , and without it			1
until he develops symptoms , or until a further 7 days pass			1
i wo n't get angry at or blame the person in the waiting room			0
i would have likely done the same thing ... you get sick , you go to the doctor			0
i have no idea what their story is and i will never know			0
but i do know one thing : if you have chosen to not vaccinate yourself or your child , i blame you			0
you have stood on the shoulders of our collective protection for too long			0
from that high height , we have given you the privilege of our protection , for free			0
and in return , you gave me this week			0
wherein i do n't know if my baby will develop something that has death as a potential outcome			0
now , let 's unpack this shall we			0
all out on the table			0
you have no idea what this ' potential outcome ' means			0
you think you are protecting your children from thimerosal ? you are n't			0
it 's not in their vaccine			0
you think you are protecting them from autism ? you are n't			0
there is no , none , nada , nothing in science that proves this			0
if you want to use google instead of science to ' prove me wrong ' then i am happy to call you an imbecile as well as misinformed			0
you think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and @entity141 and dancing by candlelight on a full moon ? you are n't			0
by being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves , our fellow man , and our most vulnerable			0
so we vaccinate ourselves and our children			0
you think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic ? you are n't			0
as an unvaccinated person you are only protected by our good graces			0
we let you be so privileged thanks to our willingness to vaccinate ourselves and our children			0
you know what vaccines protect your children from ? pain			0
and you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like			0
you would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees , begging , begging to get that vaccine into your precious babies because that is what i would have done , if i could , to save my daughter			0
the fact is , there was no vaccine for her			0
she died at age five and a half , and she is gone			0
and i watch these arguments trotted out on @entity17 and twitter citing false science and long discredited'studies ' that just wo n't stop and @entity346 quotes and ' it 's my choice ' to not vaccinate ... and i think ... what would you have done if your child lay dying ? would you give them a scientifically proven , safe and effective vaccine and risk the minuscule likelihood of a side effect ? or would you let them go , knowing that at least they wo n't develop autism ( which they would n't even develop anyway because @entity358 ) ? and do n't you dare tell me that you would n't vaccinate them then			1
you have no idea what it feels like to go through what we went through			0
so , look at @entity14			1
tell me why he gets to bear the brunt of your stupidity and reckless abuse of our protection ? tell me			0
seven more days until i know that my baby is safe			1
how is your week going , anti-vaxxers ?			1

@entity40 was told 15 - day - old @entity14 was exposed to measles
he had been in the hospital for a couple of hours for routine check - up
@entity6 lashed out at ' anti-vaxxers ' in @entity17 post
she has received hundreds of emails saying she made them *re-think*
she has to wait three more days to find out if @entity14 is infected
