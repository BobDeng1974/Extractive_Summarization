restaurant companies with 20 or more @entity2 locations will have to post calorie counts for everything they sell beginning next year because of a little - noticed line buried deep inside the @entity8 law that some studies suggest could actually backfire			1
the rule , buried 455 pages inside the @entity8 , was the brainchild of lawmakers who modeled the idea after a 2008 @entity16 law			1
dr. @entity17 , now the embattled helmsman of the @entity18 , spearheaded the @entity16 law and guided it through a series of legal challenges , arguing that information – as the saying goes – is power			1
but after the @entity26 got a calorie sticker , researchers got a shock : @entity16 eating at calorie - labeled restaurants consumer more calories than they had before the law took effect			1
the public health scientists compared meal receipts collected from @entity37 's locations in @entity38 and @entity39 with similar meal tickets scooped up from the same restaurants a year earlier			1
' posting calorie benchmarks had no direct impact , nor did it moderate the impact of calorie labels on food purchases , ' they wrote in the @entity48 ( @entity48 )			1
and the menu labeling ' appeared to promote a slight increase in calorie intake			2
' simple : @entity52 has a small range of offerings and already posts calorie ranges in every restaurant – a plan that probably wo n't pass the @entity59 's muster but is well - positioned for expansion not so simple : most traditional fast - food joints have a range of options , toppings and sauces whose potential unique combinations range into the tens of thousands unchanged : only restaurant companies with 20 or more locations will have to comply , meaning that most mom - and - pop restaurants could be at a nutritional advantage more than one in four @entity16 said they saw the calorie - counts and let the numbers affect their choices , but the receipts told a different tale			1
the same researchers published a second finding in the journal health affairs : @entity16 eaters took in more calories during the same period than restaurant patrons in nearby @entity86 , @entity87 – where there was no menu law			1
that 's a sentiment shared by @entity91 , a @entity92 businessman who told @entity93 at a @entity95 steakhouse that he is better off not knowing how many calories are lurking in his dinner			2
' the minute i have to stare at the numbers – what are they all , three digits ? and i 'm supposed to have a four - digit total ? – everything on the menu is going to look doable			2
but you know , if i 'm left to my own devices i tend to make the kind of choices i could explain to my wife with a straight face			0
' @entity112 at the next table , however , said the idea is one whose time ' is long overdue			0
' ' the loaf of bread in my kitchen has a calorie label , ' @entity91 said			2
' they 're on everything but my cigarettes , and what 's the harm ? some people need that kind of information and maybe they should have it			2
' ' just keep it off my dining room table and i 'm fine , ' she said			0
a man at her table who identified himself only as ' @entity132 ' and said he did n't want his last name in print because he works on @entity135 , said the menu labeling question was ' more about politics than science			2
' ' you have nutritionists on one side who want to be on your shoulder all the time like some caloric guardian angel , ' he said , ' and you have the restaurants on the other wide who are trying to survive on razor - thin margins and , i think , reasonably , terrified that this will be the regulation that kills them			2
' the science side of the debate is decidedly mixed			0
an @entity48 study unrelated to the first one , and about one - fourth as large , showed a modest decrease in calorie intake when eaters were shown calorie counts , but the dinners they ate ate were n't served in restaurants			1
' if someone is going to serve you thousands of calories , the least they could do is tell you how many calories it has , ' says nutrition activist @entity168 a third research report published in @entity170 looked at 1,000 minority and low - income @entity16 , finding no effect at all			1
a fourth , by @entity176 researchers , found a modest impact in @entity178 but was criticized because it compared restaurants in different neighborhoods			1
and a fifth found that @entity182 customers trimmed back their food calories by 14 per cent at locations where calorie counts were posted			1
lattes and frappucinos , however , kept their appeal : there was no impact on the beverage sales that make up more than 95 per cent of @entity182 sales			0
according to the @entity59 , a typical @entity2 female should consumer no more than 2,000 calories			2
men should top out at 2,400			0
and no meal , according to the government , should tip the scales at more than 800 calories			0
the @entity59 will soon require the display of total calories in every menu item to show up ' in a clear and conspicuous manner ' along with ' a succinct statement concerning suggested daily caloric intake			0
' it 's that second requirement that researchers in the first study thought might be confusing people			1
@entity213 professor @entity212 told @entity214 last year that consumers might see a 550 - calorie @entity216 alongside an 800 - calorie meal recommendation , and then ' maybe feel ok to go ahead and get a slightly bigger main dish , but at the same time still get the same side dish and drink they would normally get			2
' ' and then all of a sudden they 're up over 1,100 calories for the meal			0
each one item may seem ok , but it adds up			0
' @entity225 biostatistics professor dr. @entity224 , then president of the @entity227 , told a court hearing a 2008 @entity16 menu labeling lawsuit that another avenue of backfire could be the ' forbidden - fruit allure of high - calorie foods			1
' @entity233 : @entity37 's has experimented with food tray liners that play up its lower - calorie items , but hide the health cost of a @entity238 waiting on the @entity59 : a final rule from the government could come any day now , and will likely bring menus like this @entity37 's concept to every big chain restaurant in @entity2 he added that customers who heed the posted calorie warnings and walk away less full would be more likely to gorge themselves on calories later the same day			1
' what harms ( if any ) might result ...			0
is difficult to predict , ' he wrote			0
it 's also difficult to know what will happen when @entity251 has to disclose calorie counts but individual mom - and - pop restaurants wo n't			1
the debate over whether the idea works as intended – trimming @entity2 's waistline by sending fewer calories out of restaurant kitchens – has been over for four years despite the murky scientific picture			0
@entity17 , then head of the @entity16 @entity261 , conceded to the @entity262 in 2008 that by 2009 state laws modeled after @entity16 's stretched from @entity264 to @entity265 and included nearly 20 county and city ordinances			1
one of those laws was in @entity269 , where government scientists found ' small but meaningful reductions in calories bought ' 18 months later , ' particularly among the 20 percent of patrons who see and use the labels			2
' the @entity275 , among @entity95 's more powerful lobbies , opted in 2010 to embrace a national law that would let its member companies work from a single playbook instead of a patchwork quilt			0
but implementing the law is full of political maneuvering			0
not far enough : @entity284 sen. @entity283 and @entity286 rep. @entity285 , both @entity287 , want the menu labeling rules expanded to include bowling alleys , theme parks and even putt - putt courses coming to a @entity292 ? buttered popcorn labels could be devastating for cinema chains that make most of their revenue on food concessions @entity168 , chief nutritionist at the left - leaning @entity298 , told @entity299 on monday that she 's disappointed in how the @entity59 has interpreted @entity8 's food mandate			1
her group , which once famously turned fettucine alfredo into food porn by labeling it ' a heart attack on a plate , ' wants to see movie theater concession stands subject to the same rules			1
' if someone is going to serve you thousands of calories , the least they could do is tell you how many calories it has , ' she told @entity299			0
@entity168 has the support of @entity284 @entity287 sen. @entity283 and @entity286 @entity287 rep. @entity285 , who want the @entity59 to force bowling alleys , movie theaters and amusement parks to follow suit			1
' @entity321 intended the scope of the disclosure law to extend to movie theaters , bowling alleys , bookstore cafes , and other like establishments , ' the pair has written to the @entity59 , ' which is the very reason @entity321 used the phrase ' and similar retail establishments ' in the statute to extend the reach of the law beyond restaurants			1
' while the restaurant lobby may have thrown in the towel , it appears the convenience store and family entertainment lobbies have gone all - in to protect their junk food franchises			2
most affected businesses are taking a wait - and - see approach , however			0
the @entity59 could issue its final rule at any time , and the devil – or angel , depending on who 's telling the story – could be in the details			0
pizza chains are hoping for loopholes that will allow them to avoid calculating every possible topping combination			0
' pizza is so customizable that it 's literally impossible to put all the calorie information on a menu			0
' @entity357 's executive vice president @entity356 told @entity299			0
the @entity275 also wants the government to provide companies with a modicum of ' flexibility ' so they wo n't have to guarantee that every steak or bowl of soup is nutritionally identical			0
fast food restaurants want an exemption for special orders so they only have to disclose calorie counts for sandwiches built according to their standard menus .			1

members of @entity321 who pushed for the rule say it does n't go far enough and want it expanded to movie theaters , bowling alleys and theme parks
but public health researchers collected before - and - after food receipts and found people ate more calories after the requirement kicked in
*post-menu* - labeling - law @entity16 also ate more calories than people in @entity86 , where there was no law at all
requirement was modeled after a @entity16 law *shepherded* by embattled @entity18 chief @entity17
@entity8 included little - noticed *clause* requiring chain restaurants to list calorie counts where customers can see them
