horror : @entity11 , looked drained and scared as she arrived at hospital after the attack in @entity6 badly hurt : @entity11 was comforted by a fellow traveller as she was driven to hospital in @entity56 ‘ the @entity80 do send us emails , but the emails say the same every single time and they seem to imply that the @entity80 has clout , it has a voice , but clearly none of that is working because we are not getting any progress whatsoever			1
‘ i would like to see whoever threw that acid brought to justice			2
i do n’t blame the country , i do n’t blame the religion			0
he needs to be brought to justice			0
