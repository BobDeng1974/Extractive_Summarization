a pair of @entity2 artists have created this stunning installation of 9,000 silhouettes on a @entity6 beach to mark @entity7			1
the project , named , ' @entity9 ' is a tribute to the civilians , @entity13 forces and @entity14 who lost their lives during the @entity6 landing on june 6 , 1944			2
the design was the brainchild of @entity19 , 33 , and @entity20 , 50			0
together with a team of volunteers the pair travelled to @entity25 beach , @entity26 , to create the silhouettes , which were individually drawn into the sand			1
moving : the @entity7 tribute is a poignant reminder the thousands who died during @entity32 concept : according to artists @entity19 , 33 , and @entity20 , 50 , the idea behind the piece was to create a visual representation of loss on an unimaginable scale those taking part made the shape of a person by putting down a stencil and raking the surface to create a distinctive figure			1
the shapes were then left to the mercy of the tide which washed away the ' fallen ' after around four and a half hours			1
speaking of the idea behind the project @entity19 said : ' @entity9 is a sobering reminder of what happens when peace is not present			2
' the idea is to create a visual representation of what is otherwise unimaginable , the thousands of human lives lost during the hours of the tide during the second world war normandy landings			2
' people understand that so many lives were lost that day but it 's incredibly difficult to picture that number			2
sand men : the team of artists and volunteers created 9,000 of the shadows which were eventually reclaimed by the sea teamwork : the project was originally made of 60 people , but after locals learned about the tribute they quickly joined in lending a hand : by the end of the day it is estimated that 500 people had chipped in to create the stunning beach art ' you could see the horrific casualty of war when you stood on the cliff looking down at the beach			1
' watching the tide come in and wash the bodies away was symbolic of all the lives lost in all wars , not just during the @entity6			0
' veterans and families , including some who have lost loved ones in recent conflicts have been involved in the project			0
@entity19 , who has been working with partner since 2009 , said : ' we turned up to the beach with a team of 60 people but by the end we had over 500 people taking part			1
' there were people from all over the world who had heard about the event and travelled all the way to @entity107 to take part			0
unity : @entity6 is remembered as one of the great showings of wartime unity as the @entity14 forced launched their assault on @entity114 occupied @entity107 reclaimed : the installation was designed so that the sea would wash over the bodies and wipe them from the beach in a moving reminder of the tragedy of war achievement : artists @entity20 , right and @entity19 , left said they hoped their art would remind people of the value of peace			1
' there were others who happened to be walking by and wanted to get involved			0
' it showed that people from all over totally understood the message behind it and i found it very overwhelming			0
' some people told us that they had lost family in the @entity139 and others said they had lost loved ones in @entity142 and wanted to pay a tribute to them			0
' we finished all the stencils at about 7.30pm and everyone gathered and waited for the tide to come in			0
' the last silhouette was washed away at about 10pm and it was incredibly moving			1
