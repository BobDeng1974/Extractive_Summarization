by @entity0 published : 16:41 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 16:46 est , 6 october 2012 the tragic death of poet @entity2 at the age of just 25 may have been due to his mother ’s heavy drinking , according to a new biography			1
professor @entity7 has drawn upon new medical evidence to suggest that @entity2 – one of the main romantic poets along with @entity10 and @entity11 – may have suffered from foetal alcohol syndrome ( @entity13 ) caused by his mother ’s drinking while she was pregnant			1
@entity13 is a series of mental and physical defects which can occur in a foetus which has had exposure to alcohol			1
gifted : a painting of @entity2 @entity7 , chair of the @entity22 , has highlighted research by the eminent professor @entity24 which suggests the poet ’s small head and projecting upper lip are clear symptoms of a foetal alcohol effect			1
the research also suggests the poet ’s small stature , stocky upper torso and small lower limbs are evidence of a congenital cardio - vascular condition			1
in the book , @entity2 , he argues that @entity13 may have also left him vulnerable to disease , including the @entity40 which killed him in @entity41 in 1821			1
he writes : ‘ @entity2 was born prematurely because his mother drank			2
aspects of @entity2 ’s physiognomy – the small head and faded hands with swollen veins – suggest symptoms of what we would now call foetal alcohol syndrome which may have rendered him susceptible to disease			1
’ new research : professor @entity7 has drawn on new evidence to suggest @entity2 may have had the syndrome although @entity2 did have some of the physical attributes associated with @entity13 , the claim is likely to prove controversial			1
dr @entity60 , a consultant and senior clinical lecturer in neonatal medicine at @entity63 , last night remained unconvinced			2
he said : ‘ it is true that being a small baby and short of stature is something that goes with @entity13			2
' but being small is much more common than the syndrome			2
' around 60 per cent of people who suffer from the condition have poor iq and language skills and clearly that was not a problem for @entity2			1
’ @entity7 ’s biography charts @entity2 ’ fraught relationship with his mother @entity77 , a known drinker , and examines the way this affected his work and his relationships with women			0
@entity7 also sheds light on the poet ’s celebrated , but unconsummated , relationship with @entity87 , cited as an inspiration for one of his most well known sonnets , @entity91			0
he is convinced the couple ’s mutual attraction would have faded if it had not been for @entity2 ’ premature death			0
he says : ‘ i think temperamentally and pathologically the relationship with @entity87 would have floundered sooner or later if he had lived			0
it ’s a very different view from @entity91 ... because i think the evidence points in a much darker direction			0
i think it was a relationship of dazzling intensity but at the same time full of suspicion , jealousy , resentment and bitterness			0
’ @entity7 also claims that @entity2 believed the failure to consummate the relationship was one of the reasons for his illness			0
he writes : ‘ as he becomes severely ill he attributes the illness to the fact he could not express himself sexually			0
' it was bound up with neurotic ideas that sexual frustration was causing his tb			2
’ @entity2 enjoyed little success during his lifetime but his poems today are among the most celebrated in the @entity122 language			0
@entity2 , by @entity7 , is published by @entity123 .			0

the condition , caused by mothers drinking alcohol while pregnant , causes low birth *weight* and physical defects
the condition may have also left him vulnerable to disease , including the tb which killed him in @entity41 in 1821
