click here to see the final leaderboard from @entity2 with the pressure of closing in on his first @entity6 crown weighing on his shoulders , @entity3 grew frustrated with a fan whose noise interrupted his backswing at the 16th hole on sunday			1
the three - shot leader hit an almost perfect drive down the centre of the fairway - but took exception to one member of the crowd , pointing them out to be ejected with his club			1
speaking out about the incident later , @entity3 said he had been consistently heckled by the offender throughout the day			2
i want that one : @entity3 picks out the heckler with his driver during the final round of @entity6 it was him : the @entity6 leader points out the disturbance from the crowd after a shot down the fairway family affair : the 25 - year - old was joined by his mum @entity36 and dad @entity37 after seeing off the heckler happy chappy : the new open champion poes with the famous @entity41 in the locker room after his win ' he was giving me grief all day , ' the three - time @entity45 winner said			1
' i sort of put it up for the first 15 holes , and then he deliberately coughed on my downswing on the 16th tee			0
' i still hit a great drive			0
but i heard it halfway down and i knew who it was			0
so i turned around and got him chucked out , thankfully			0
' i do n't know who it was			0
but i did n't have him bothering me for the last two holes , which was nice			0
' @entity3 managed to keep his emotions in check to win his third major , finishing two shots clear of his closest rival			2
and second - placed @entity66 also had issues with the @entity69 crowd , leaving the putting surface on the same hole to enter the crowd and have words with an encroaching spectator			2
the actions of both spectators were a big step away from the typical crowd etiquette , and both appeared to be ejected from the grounds at @entity2 on request of the two leaders			1
pressure building : @entity3 takes issue with the member of the crowd despite hitting an excellent shot @entity88 : the @entity6 champion alert marshals to the presence of the disruptive fan at @entity2 over the shoulder : @entity3 continues walking up to take his next shot but still wants to keep an eye on the crowd @entity97 handed : the spectator deemed to have offended by @entity3 is led away from the 16th off you go : @entity3 's request to the marshals seemed to be successful with this man being led away			1
