by @entity0 , @entity1 fourth seed @entity2 was handed a walkover into the third round of the @entity6 when opponent @entity7 pulled out with hip problems			1
the @entity9 had surgery on both hips after the @entity12 and did not want to take a risk when he felt pain in the left one following his first - round win over @entity17			2

for sure something is there			0
i 've got to get it checked			0
it 's not good right now			0
treatment table : @entity7 withdrew from the @entity6 with a hip injury plain sailing : fourth seed @entity2 had a free pass to the fourth round " i ca n't afford to get on court and play against @entity2 and cause much more pain to myself because i 'm going to have to stay with him the whole match			1
" i can potentially make it 10 times worse			0
for me it 's the best thing not to go on court today			0
it 's a very difficult decision for me , but i have to do this			0
" it has been a season of wild extremes for @entity7 , who played the quickest recorded match in @entity45 history on his comeback from surgery when he lost to @entity48 in 28 minutes in @entity49			2
he subsequently dropped out of the top 100 after a torrid run only to win the second title of his career in @entity53 in july			0
seventh seed @entity54 had not won a match at @entity57 before this year but he is through to the third round without dropping a set after a 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 2 victory over @entity61			1
thumbs up : @entity62 has been impressive so far at the @entity6 on a roll : @entity54 is on top form at @entity57 , crushing @entity61 in the third round congratulations : @entity66 ( left ) shakes hands with vanquished opponent @entity68 @entity62 has also been impressive so far , and the 14th seed 's 7 - 6 ( 7/2 ) 6 - 2 6 - 4 victory over @entity71 set up a third - round clash with 18th seed @entity73 , who came from a set down to beat @entity75			1
@entity66 avoided his customary drama in a 7 - 5 6 - 3 6 - 2 win over @entity68 while 19th seed @entity78 won in four sets against @entity81			1
comfortable : @entity73 dispatched opponent @entity75 in straight sets on the stretch : @entity78 keeps his eye on the ball as he beats @entity81			1
