@entity0 is searching for two @entity2 teenage girls who they believe were tricked into going to @entity3 to fight for @entity5 rebels			1
@entity6 , 16 , and @entity7 , 15 , vanished from their homes in @entity10 on april 10			1
but the first hint their parents received as to where the girls might have gone was a spate of social media posts claiming they had gone to fight a ' holy war '			1
missing : @entity6 , left , and @entity19 , right , have disappeared , leaving behind @entity21 posts showing them in niqabs and wielding assault rifles ' never find us ' : messages from the girls , which their parents doubt were really written by them , boasted that they could not be found but the parents say that they do nâ€™t believe the messages are being written by the girls			1
authorities suspect they have been tricked into leaving the country			0
@entity6 and @entity7 come from @entity33 refugee families who settled in @entity2 after the ethnic wars of the 1990s , and were born in the country			1
the fighting in @entity3 continues to be fierce - just today a bomb was detonated in the northern city of @entity39 , destroying buildings and injuring children			1
war - torn : @entity0 believe the girls have been taken to @entity3			1
pictured is a man carrying a wounded child after a bombing today in @entity39 , northern @entity3 damage : emergency services respond to the bombing in war - torn @entity39 posts : @entity6 , left , and @entity51 , right , have posted photographs of themselves in @entity54 dress from unknown locations new photos on their @entity21 pages show them brandishing @entity59 rifles - and in some cases surrounded by armed men			1
however , it has since emerged that some of these pictures have been circulated online for years - casting doubt on whether they actually show the girls			2
in the latest posting they announced plans to marry so that they could become ' holy warriors ' and in the messages they say : ' death is our goal '			0
their families doubt that the messages were really written by them			0
@entity2 officials believe that the pair , judging by the scenes around them , are in a training camp and are not only already married , but also already living in the homes of their new husbands			0
in @entity10 the family admitted that the two had recently started going to a local mosque run by a radical @entity86 , @entity87			0
the girls ' fathers are reportedly already abroad looking for their daughters , who have not contacted their parents			0
armed : this image , posted on @entity21 , implies that it shows @entity7 holding a rifle			2
however , the image has been available online for years so is unlikely to really show her ' new life ' : this post appears to show the two girls making a determined gesture - however doubts have been raised that it really shows them it is thought that they have been sending online messages to their friends speaking of their new lives and boasting that ' nobody will ever find us '			2
@entity2 media said the two teenagers had become the public face for the call to jihad in @entity3 , and alleged that they had been tricked into going to the country in order to publicise the call to arms			1
the latest case of young people getting caught up in the @entity3 conflict comes after an 18 - year - old @entity119 man died in @entity3 - only for his father to reveal he had no idea his son had gone there			2
@entity124 , 18 , from @entity125 , @entity126 , was caught up in fighting in @entity3			2
but his father @entity127 said today : ' at the moment we do not have details of his death			0
all that we know is that he was killed in @entity3			0
' @entity124 was the nephew of former @entity135 detainee @entity134			0
killed in @entity3 : @entity124 , 18 , was recently killed in @entity3			0
