investigations into the shooting of @entity2 continue , despite a grand jury decision not to indict police officer @entity4 , the @entity6 attorney general has said			1
the @entity7 will continue to pursue two investigations , one into potential civil rights violations by @entity10 when he shot dead 18 - year - old unarmed @entity2 in @entity11 , @entity12 , and one into the practices of the @entity14			1
the attorney general also addressed the violence which has followed the @entity19 jury ’s decision saying ’ it does not honour @entity2 ’s memory to engage in violence or looting ’			1
however , the @entity35 and the @entity7 are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations by @entity10 , and a broader inquiry has been launched into the police practices of the overwhelmingly white @entity11 force , which operates in a predominantly black community			1
attorney general @entity25 said in a statement following the conclusion of the grand jury proceeding , that the federal inquiry has always been independent of the one in the @entity19 , and will remain so			1
‘ while the grand jury proceeding in @entity19 has concluded , the @entity7 ’s investigation into the shooting of @entity2 remains ongoing , ’ attorney general @entity25 , 63 , said			1
‘ in addition , the @entity7 continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the @entity52			2
' the @entity7 are investigating whether it can be shown that officer @entity10 ( right ) willfully deprived 18 - year - old @entity2 ( left ) of his civil rights when he shot him several times while he was unarmed violence : police gather on the streets of @entity11 as protesters react after the announcement of the grand jury decision not to indict @entity11 police officer @entity4 in the death of @entity2 the @entity7 will continue to pursue two investigations , one into potential civil rights violations by officer @entity4 when he shot @entity2 and one into the practices of the @entity14 tears : a female protester uses milk to counter police pepper spray after a group of demonstrators attempted to stop traffic on @entity74 in @entity11 , @entity12 attorney general @entity25 added : ' @entity2 ’s death was a tragedy			1
this incident has sparked a national conversation about the need to ensure confidence between law enforcement and the communities they protect and serve			0
' though there will be disagreement with the grand jury 's decision not to indict , this feeling should not lead to violence			1
' those who decide to participate in demonstrations should remember the wishes of @entity2 's parents , who have asked that remembrances of their son be conducted peacefully			0
it does not honor his memory to engage in violence or looting			0
' in the coming days , it will likewise be important for local law enforcement authorities to respect the rights of demonstrators , and deescalate tensions by avoiding excessive displays — and uses — of force federal investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution against officer @entity4			2
whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges , @entity7 lawyers have a single focus : whether it can be shown that officer @entity4 willfully deprived 18 - year - old @entity2 of his civil rights			1
that is a difficult burden to meet , especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force			0
riots in the streets : policemen clash with protesters in @entity11 after mass riots broke out overnight @entity128 : a car on fire outside the @entity52 on monday night two sides : protesters confront black police officers during a march in @entity11 a group of protesters vandalize a police vehicle after the announcement of the grand jury decision the inquiry into the practices of the entire @entity141 is focusing on stops , searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department			1
it has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the @entity11 force			1
such broader reviews typically rely on data and interviews in the community and can take far longer than a criminal investigation			0
the @entity7 has initiated roughly 20 investigations of troubled police departments in the past five years , or more than twice the number undertaken in the five years before that			0
and regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation , there 's also the potential that @entity2 's family could file a wrongful - death lawsuit against @entity4			2
the attorney general said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office , a move which is expected to be imminent as @entity173 picked his choice of replacement earlier this month			1
@entity177 federal prosecutor @entity176 , 55 , was announced as the president ’s choice over two weeks ago , but needs to be confirmed by the @entity180			0
if she is confirmed , ms @entity176 would make history as the first black woman to serve as attorney general			2
what other investigations are underway ? the @entity35 and the @entity7 are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations			1
investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution			0
whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges , @entity7 lawyers have a single focus : whether it can be shown that @entity4 willfully deprived @entity2 of his civil rights			1
that is a difficult burden to meet , especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force			0
some other past high - profile police shootings , including the 1999 killing of @entity206 in @entity207 , did not result in federal prosecutions			0
what about broader allegations of racial insensitivity on the part of the @entity11 police department ? beyond the shooting itself , the @entity7 is conducting a wide - reaching investigation into the practices of the entire department			1
that investigation is focusing on stops , searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department			0
it has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the @entity11 force			1

how long might these other investigations go on ? the @entity7 has not set a timeline for either investigation , though outgoing attorney general @entity25 has said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office			1
he said late on monday that that investigation was independent of the local probe , and that " we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence			0
" how will authorities deal with any protests ? president @entity173 appealed for calm and understanding monday after the no - indictment announcement , saying the country needed ' to accept that this decision was the grand jury 's to make			2
' @entity25 , too , said the decision should not lead to violence			0
even so , within minutes of the announcement , crowds in the streets of @entity11 shattered windows , vandalized cars and taunted police while officers released smoke and pepper spray to disperse the gatherings			2
in anticipation of the protests , @entity12 gov. @entity275 pre-emptively declared a state of emergency and activated the @entity279			0
gun sales surged before the grand jury decision and some shop owners boarded up their stores			2
a federal law enforcement team has been working with top commanders in @entity11 and from neighboring police departments to help reduce tensions and build trust			2
are there longer - term efforts to deal with underlying problems ? @entity275 several days ago named 16 members to a panel aimed at helping the community heal after the shooting			0
the commission , which will study underlying social and economic conditions , is expected to make recommendations in a report due by september 2015 .			0
