@entity1 paid $ 2.5million for the pad , the @entity14 exclusively reported - $ 400,000 less than the list price			2
a quick peep : former @entity2 frontman @entity1 has purchased this two - bedroom apartment in the @entity8 landmark @entity9 ; here , the living room has plenty of space for entertaining room with a view : the apartment is across the street from the southern entrance to @entity29 doubling up : the second bedroom will most certainly get a rocker overhaul notable : his apartment is in @entity9 , an @entity35 landmark the outspoken @entity37 rocker has been vocal over his distaste for the @entity4 , once telling @entity39 that ‘ @entity4 gigs are soul - destroying , ’ as ‘ there are a lot of people eating pizza			1
’ moving on up : @entity1 , who was the frontman of @entity2 , has a piece of @entity47 to call his own however , he seems to have gotten over that sentiment			0
the property was sold by @entity52 ’s @entity51			0
the @entity9 , one of @entity8 ’s many landmarks , serves as both a hotel and permanent residences			0
it is immediately recognisable due to the neon sign on the roof 44 storeys up that also reads ‘ @entity9			0
’ located on @entity61 between @entity62 and @entity63 , it sits squarely across the street from the southern edge of @entity29			1
@entity1 ’s two bedroom , two - and - a - half bathroom property comes complete with a modern kitchen , herringbone floors , a washer and dryer in the unit , as well as access to the residence ’s health club and spa			1
there is ample room for a dining area in the apartment ’s living room			0
though his accommodations are decidedly modern , many other residences within @entity9 maintain their original @entity35 styling			0
the prime location puts the musician near @entity29 , @entity87 , @entity88 , the @entity89 , and the @entity90 , as well as dozens of elite dining establishments			1
unfortunately for @entity1 , there are two pizzerias within a two - block radius of his new apartment			2
party like a rock star : the modern kitchen has granite counter tops and a 40 - bottle wine cooler @entity100 digs : the lobby of @entity9 features checked marble and recessed lighting ; there 's also a 24 - hour concierge service sweeping view : the @entity9 , at 160 @entity61 , was designed by architect @entity107 and opened in 1930 ; here , its famed neon sign can be seen along with part of @entity47 's skyline @entity113 home : a floorplan of the two - bedroom apartment @entity1 has bought in @entity47 opposite @entity29			1
