the 38 - year - old mother of two is a fan of @entity2 , a philosophy that encourages ‘ co-sleeping ’ and ‘ baby wearing ’			1
co-sleepers like to share the same bed as their children , while baby wearers carry their offspring in a sling close to their body for most of the day			1
@entity0 , who has sons aged nine and six , reveals in a new book that she breast - fed them until they were four and two respectively			1

the research involved more than 8,000 men and women who were tested for their cardio - respiratory fitness when walking or running on a treadmill in four clinic visits every two years			2

the new device , called a @entity85 system , uses three cameras on the front and side of a flexible arm which gives a 330 - degree view of the colon walls			0
in one study in @entity94 , where the technology was developed , it was shown to have a ‘ miss rate ’ of just eight per cent for adenomas – the polyps which can turn into cancer – compared with a 42 per cent miss rate for the traditional design			0
