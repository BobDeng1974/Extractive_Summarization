by @entity0 my seven - year - old daughter @entity1 could n’t have been more delighted when it was her turn to take @entity4 home for the weekend			0
eyes shining , she hugged the cuddly toy that doubled as her class mascot , handing me a large cloth bag stuffed with spare clothes for him and a diary where we were supposed to record his experiences			1
she ’d been looking forward to playing host to @entity4 for weeks and already had a whole range of activities lined up for him , from tree - climbing to chicken - feeding and bouncing together on the trampoline			0
@entity1 could n't wait for a weekend of fun - filled activities to share with @entity25 bear a dab hand with my smartphone , @entity1 was snapping pictures of herself and @entity25 before we even got in the front door			1
it could n’t have been a more innocent extra-curricular activity			1
but , as i was soon to discover , even this simple game had been sullied by the most toxic trait of modern parenting : elbow - sharp competitiveness			0
most mums will be able to tell you that @entity25 — or another close cuddly relation — is now the undisputed king of classrooms across the country			0
used as educational tools by primary schools to encourage pupils ’ writing and story - telling skills , toys such as @entity25 go home with a different child every week , along with a diary for their hosts to fill in			0
it seems like a perfectly harmless idea , and it probably was when it originated in the @entity55 a decade ago			0
but just one peek in @entity25 ’s diary revealed what he had got up to on his previous away - days — and simple picnics it was not			0
this was a toy who had been given a taste of the high life			1
a teddy with a taste for the high life : a school bear enjoys itself in @entity70 it was clear that some of my fellow school-gate mums had whipped themselves into a frenzy trying to match the picture - perfect lives of their bear ’s previous hosts			1
there was @entity25 taking riding lessons , dining out in fancy restaurants and indulging his taste for @entity85 football from the touchline			2
was that a helicopter i saw parked behind him ? what a charming hat to keep the sun off his face in @entity92 ! and the other mums ’ homes were almost uniformly spotless , their children immaculate , whereas i had n’t had time to have my hair done , let alone have the house redecorated			0
further investigation revealed the same story across @entity101 : teddies were being treated to sun loungers and sports cars by parents everywhere from @entity106 to @entity107			2
then came the most high - flying weekend i could dream up at such short notice : a jaunt to a @entity111 stately home for high tea , followed by the sailing club to show @entity25 how to set a spinnaker even a quick flick through my friends ’ @entity116 pages brought up countless pictures of different mascots from schools around the country enjoying a lifestyle that would rival that of the @entity125			1
teddies were climbing @entity127 , sunning themselves aboard luxury yachts and availing themselves of exotic canapes in every far - flung corner of the world			0
how could our @entity4 ever live up to the standard set so high ? still , i was determined to try			2
a new photoshoot got underway			0
@entity1 had her face scrubbed and her hair scraped back into a tidy bun before we posed her with @entity25 at her ballet lesson			0
forget the playroom , strewn with @entity141			0
that week she did her homework , with @entity25 by her side , in the freshly polished drawing room			0
then came the most high - flying weekend i could dream up at such short notice : a jaunt to a @entity111 stately home for high tea , followed by the sailing club to show @entity25 how to set a spinnaker			1
come monday morning , and a last - minute panic , it was bye - bye to @entity154 in an @entity156 bowl and hello to porridge , fresh fruit and @entity161 tableware			0
i ’ve rarely felt so stressed , and i ’m not alone : internet forums are filled with mothers driven to the brink by the visit of their class bear			1
reaching new heights : @entity168 takes a a trip to @entity170 one teacher tells how competitive parents at her school became , despite the instructions being to draw pictures or write a sentence about doing a simple task such as posting a letter or going to the park			1
‘ we had ticket stubs from rugby internationals , postcards , photos and trips to all sorts of places			2
’ another mother confesses : ‘ we ensure the photos are angled so the kitchen looks good and you ca n’t see the missing unit or messy worktops			2
’ @entity193 , a consultant clinical psychologist and a specialist in child and adolescent development , thinks that the poor job market has also made parents snap into a more competitive , aggressive ‘ survival mode ’			1
she says : ‘ they are worried that their children are n’t going to succeed , so there is a mad scramble to buy them popularity and status			2
i ’ve rarely felt so stressed , and i ’m not alone : internet forums are filled with mothers driven to the brink by the visit of their class bear ‘ the bear is seen as a useful way to show where you are in the social pecking order and get a foothold for your child up the ladder			1
’ @entity221 , 52 , a teaching assistant at a state primary school in @entity223 near @entity224 , says that her school bear is just as likely to go on a cruise as share a tv dinner			2
but with a mix of pupils from affluent middle - class families and others on benefits , the bear serves only to emphasize the difference			1
‘ it ’s sad to look through the bear ’s diary and see lots of blank pages from some families , alongside glossy pictures of the teddy having a whale of a time with children who have a lot of material possessions , ’ she says			1
and if the teachers are noticing the social divide , you know the children are , too			1
indeed , evidence gathered by the @entity251 suggests that some schools are now phasing out the bears to avoid putting a strain on parents			2
@entity256 , a consultant psychologist based in @entity257 who specialises in family life , says that competitive parenting has always existed , but has changed from emphasising academic prowess — the kid with a genius iq — to wealth and status			1
‘ competitive parenting is now more about material possessions — “ my car is bigger than yours			1
” the answer is to reassure children that they are special and unique			0
there will always be people who are richer than you , but a loving family is the most important thing , not electric gates			0
’ yet @entity277 , 44 , a primary school teacher in @entity278 , thinks a total ban would be a shame			0
‘ in my experience , kids love the bear and identify with it , ’ she says			1
‘ as well as being a useful educational tool , it really helps teachers gain a window into their home life , which can be very revealing			1
‘ it may be clear that the child ’s learning development is not supported , and we can offer extra help at school			2
or that a child ’s mum is doing their homework for them			0
that is really obvious , too			0
’ well - traveled : a teddy on a trip to @entity303 shows how far parents are willing to go to beat each other in the battle of the bear but some parents have already started a backlash against the one - upmanship			1
one teacher told the @entity251 that her class bear had been returned on monday with a photo and a caption reading : ‘ the bear wandered aimlessly around @entity315 , looking at taps			1
’ ‘ the bear is seen as a useful way to show where you are in the social pecking order and get a foothold for your child up the ladder			1
’ @entity193 another parent revealed that the bear had ‘ enjoyed the afternoon spinning around the washing machine to clean off the ingrained dirt it had accumulated during the school year ’			1
and , to my horror , i discovered that my own husband , worn out from my efforts to posh up our lifestyle , had punctured my carefully crafted image of domestic bliss			0
after i had dropped the bear back at school , he told me that he had stuck in some pictures i had n’t authorised			2
@entity25 was down the pub having a pint and a curry , before indulging in a fry - up beside a digital clock which revealed it was 3am			0
what would the other oh - so perfect mums think when they saw @entity25 with a pint of bitter between his chunky paws ? so i ’m already planning next year ’s teddy bear outing			2
with a little preparation , and some cleverly photoshopped pictures of exotic locations , @entity25 ’s next visit to the @entity352 household will beat all those other yummy mummies hands down .			0

what should be an innocent activity has become a social divide
