twenty years ago world leaders met for the first ever climate change summit but new figures show that since then the globe has become hotter and weather has become more weird			1
numbers show that carbon dioxide emissions are up , the global temperature has increased , sea levels are rising along with the earth 's population			1
the statistics come as more than 190 nations opened talks on monday at a @entity15 global warming conference in @entity16 , @entity17			1
it is hoped the summit will pave the way for an international treaty on climate change , which would follow on from the first ever @entity23 in @entity24 in 1992 , where leaders pledged to try and tackle climate change			1
now data since 1983 has been analysed to show how the global climate is changing			0
and professor of geosciences and international affairs at @entity33 @entity32 said : ' simply put , we are rapidly remaking the planet and beginning to suffer the consequences			0
' @entity37 the first figures show that since 1992 , there have been more than 6,600 major climate , weather and water disasters worldwide , causing more than $ 1.6 trillion in damage and killing more than 600,000 people , according to the @entity45 in @entity46 , which tracks the world 's catastrophes			1
while climate - related , not all can be blamed on man - made warming or climate change			1
but , extreme weather has noticeably increased over the years , says @entity53 , who runs the centre and its database			1
from 1983 to 1992 the world averaged 147 climate , water and weather disasters each year			2
over the past 10 years , that number has jumped to an average 306 a year			0
in the @entity63 , an index of climate extremes — hot and cold , wet and dry — kept by the @entity64 has jumped 30 percent from 1992 to 2013 , not counting hurricanes , based on 10 - year averages			0
worldwide , the 10 - year average for weather - related losses adjusted for inflation was $ 30 billion a year from 1983 - 92 , according to insurance giant @entity71 from 2004 to 2013 , the cost was more than three times that on average , or $ 131 billion a year			0
ms @entity53 and others say it would be wrong to pin all , or even most , of these increases on climate change alone			2
but they note a trend of growing extremes and more disasters , and that fits with what scientists have long said about global warming			2
temperature average global temperatures in 2000 , which are considerably lower compared to 2013 the average annual temperature for 2014 is on track to be 14.6 degrees @entity91 , compared with 14.1 degrees @entity91 in 1992 in terms of temperature , 2014 is set to be the warmest in record , with the globe breaking six monthly heat records in 2014 and 47 since 1992			0
the last monthly cold record set was in 1916			0
the average annual temperature for 2014 is on track to be 14.6 degrees @entity91 , compared with 14.1 degrees @entity91 in 1992			0
oceans meanwhile , the world 's oceans have risen by about three inches since 1992 and become more acidic , by about half a per cent , thanks to chemical reactions caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide , scientists at @entity64 and the @entity101 say			1
the @entity108 and @entity109 also report that every year , sea ice cover shrinks to a yearly minimum size in the @entity112 in september — a measurement that is considered a key climate change indicator			2
data from @entity116 shows that sea levels have also continued to rise as a result of climate change from 1983 to 1992 , the lowest it got on average was 2.62 million square miles			1
now the 10 - year average is down to 1.83 million square miles that loss , an average 790,000 square miles since 1992 , overshadows the slight gain in sea ice in @entity126 , which has seen an average gain of 110,000 square miles of sea ice over the past 22 years			2
@entity129 within the same time frame , the world 's population has also risden from 5.46 billion in 1992 to 7.18 billion today , meaning it is a third higher			0
this means more carbon pollution and more people who could be vulnerable to global warming			2
a map showing the extent of the @entity112 ice cap in 1980 using data from the @entity108 and @entity109 by 2012 , large parts of the ice cap has melted while carbon dioxide pollution has steadily increased and some of the biggest climate change effects on land are near the polar ice caps			1
from 1992 to 2011 , @entity147 's ice sheet lost 3.35 trillion tons of ice , according to calculations made by scientists using measurements from @entity116 's grace satellite while @entity126 lost 1.56 trillion tons of ice over the same period			0
the air a graph showing how carbon emissions have increased since the 1970s , with only @entity158 's emissions decreasing at the same time , carbon dioxide pollution has increased steadily by 60 per cent from 1992 to 2013			1
in 1992 , the world spewed 24.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide , now it is 39.8 billion , according to the @entity162 , an international consortium			1
@entity163 has tripled its emissions from 3 billion tons to 11 billion tons a year but emissions from the @entity63 have gone up more slowly , by about 6 percent , from 5.4 billion tons to 5.8 billion tons			0
@entity166 also has tripled its emissions , from 860 million tons to 2.6 billion tons with only @entity158 countries seeing their emissions go down , from 4.5 billion tons to 3.8 billion tons			0
now scientists are warning that world leaders have caused global warming to spiral out of control despite knowing the climate was changing			1
a satellite image showing the retreat of the @entity178 glacier in @entity163 which was shown to the @entity180 summit the @entity182 glacier in @entity183 which has also decreased as a result of global warming @entity186 , a climate scientist at @entity188 said : ' overall , what really strikes me is the missed opportunity			1
' we knew by the early 1990s that global warming was coming , yet we have done essentially nothing to head off the risk			2
i think that future generations may be justifiably angry about this			0
while @entity198 , a climate scientist at @entity200 added : ' greenhouse gases are rising steadily and the cause is fossil fuel burning and other human activities			0
the globe is warming , ice is melting and our climate is changing as a result			0

first climate change summit took place in 1992 in when leaders pledged to tackle climate change
but figures show that 20 years on the world has continued to get hotter with carbon dioxide emissions on the up
extreme weather events have also increased over the past 20 years along with population and sea levels
comes as a @entity15 global warming conference opens in @entity17 as scientists are warning that we are now suffering consequences of climate change
