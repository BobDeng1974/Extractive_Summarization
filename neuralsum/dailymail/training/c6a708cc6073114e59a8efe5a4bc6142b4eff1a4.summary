a @entity1 forensic archaeologist has unearthed fresh evidence to prove the existence of mass graves at the @entity6 death camp @entity7 - scuppering the claims of @entity10 deniers who say it was merely a transit camp			1
some 800,000 @entity13 were killed at the site , in north east @entity15 , during the @entity16 but a lack of physical evidence in the area has been exploited by @entity10 deniers			1
forensic archaeologist @entity20 has now undertaken the first co-ordinated scientific attempt to locate the graves			1
@entity7 death camp in @entity15 where 17,000 @entity24 is one of the few reminders of the horrific events of the past as jewish religious law forbids disturbing burial sites , she and her team from the @entity29 have used ' ground - penetrating radar '			1
her work at the site , where the @entity35 tried to destroy all traces of industrial - scale killing , is being followed in forthcoming @entity39 documentary @entity38			1
@entity20 said : ' all the history books state that @entity7 was destroyed by the @entity35 but the survey has demonstrated that simply is n’t the case			1
' i ’ve identified a number of buried pits using geophysical techniques			2
these are considerable in size , and very deep , one in particular is 26 by 17 metres			2
' the programme ’s presenter says that the pits contain the burnt remains of thousands of bodies			2
the forensic archaeologist , who has now presented her findings to the authorities responsible for the memorial at @entity7 , added : ' i really hope this is the first stage in a long - term programme to seek out those hidden graves of the @entity10			1
' @entity61 remembers his arrival at the camp ’s railway station , packed into a cattle wagon			2
' i was with my mother			2
we were about 100 people in a wagon			0
they opened the doors , firing guns and hitting us , and sent us into a yard			0
i ran with my mother and tried to calm her			0
' they told me to leave my mother but i did n’t do it quickly and i was hit on the head			0
when i got up , she was gone			0
she went with all the rest of the women to the gas chamber			0
' @entity7 was a @entity6 death camp in occupied @entity15 near the village of @entity7 during @entity16 the camp was constructed as part of @entity83 @entity7 operated between july 23 , 1942 and october 19 , 1943 during this time , approximately 850,000 men , women and children were killed at @entity7			0
this figure includes more than 800,000 jews , as well as a few thousand romani people the camp , which was operated by the @entity91 and @entity92 , was split into two sections named @entity94 treblinka i was designed for forced - labour center @entity97 was designed as a death factory with more than 99 per cent of all arrivals being immediately sent to its gas chambers			0
@entity97 ended operations on october 19 , 1943 following a revolt by its @entity104			0
beginning in march 1942 , the @entity91 implemented @entity105 to cover up the murder of millions of people during @entity83			0
there actions were so comprehensive that ever since the end of the @entity16 , holocaust deniers have used the site as evidence of misinformation about @entity6 genocide			1
they claim the site was merely a transit camp - a myth now debunked by the latest discoveries of mass graves .			1

' ground penetrating radar ' used because @entity13 burial sites can not be disturbed
holocaust deniers had *previously* used the lack of graves to *support* their *theories*
