by @entity0 , defence correspondent under cover of darkness , a team of @entity3 fighters creep out to bury a deadly improvised explosive device in @entity7			1
the four insurgents intend to wreak death and destruction by blowing up a convoy of @entity13 and @entity7 troops travelling along the dirt road unaware of the danger ahead			1
but on this occasion , carnage was averted ... thanks to @entity20 fast jets			1
seconds later , a second @entity39 warplane roared just 100ft above the insurgents ’ heads in an intimidating show of force , causing them to flee in terror			2
using information from the jets ’ advanced @entity51 surveillance pod , which sends real - time images to commanders , coalition forces were able to locate and destroy the hastily - buried bomb			1
the extraordinary footage has been released for the first time by the @entity57			0
a @entity22 aircraft 's cameras spot fighters planting the bomb under cover of darkness , using infra - red cameras the insurgents gather around the area where they are planting the @entity30 , unaware they are being watched the insurgents begin to spot the @entity22 as it roars overhead , but continue to attempt to deploy their ied the dramatic video illustrates the array of capabilities available to @entity39 troops to smash the @entity3 's bomb - making networks and protect @entity73 soldiers			1
the incident took place on march 10 and involved jets from the @entity20 's @entity77 deployed in @entity78 , southern @entity7			1
the @entity39 aircrews had been tasked to support the convoy as it moved through @entity81 , in the west of the wartorn country , following an earlier ied blast			2
flight lieutenant @entity85 , who flew one @entity22 , said : ' identifying insurgent activity from 10,000 feet can be challenging but in this case it was clearly suspicious			2
' two people on a motorbike rendezvoused with two others waiting by a small bridge			0
they collected items stored under the bridge and began digging in the road			0
' aware the insurgents were planting a roadside bomb , ft lt @entity85 flew low and fast and fired flares to frighten the insurgents who scattered on motorbike			2
he said : ' having been startled by our jet noise the insurgents fled by motorbike			2
the whole event was over in a minute			0
' the presence of a tornado provides a huge psychological impact , reassuring @entity73 troops and the civilian population , and sparking fear in the insurgents			2
' a few of the @entity3 insurgents abandon their attempt , trying to escape using a vehicle ( top left ) , while others hang back the rest of the insurgents scatter as the @entity22 whizzes over their heads , leaving the @entity30 on the road , which is tracked through heat signatures using their incredibly high tech cameras wing commander @entity125 , @entity126 's officer commanding who piloted the second aircraft in the mission , said : ' the troops found enough explosives to have caused multiple casualties among coalition forces or the local civilian population			1
' it ’s good to have removed that threat			0
' the @entity137 did not fire missiles at the insurgents so they could exploit evidence from the ieds and gather intelligence on who was laying them			0
@entity13 sergeant @entity145 , a forward air controller with the @entity148 - based @entity147 , 5th infantry of the @entity149 which had troops in the convoy , said : ' when the @entity153 do shows of presence they almost scrape the ground			1
' they fly so low you do n't know what it means			0
' what i like is the quality of the pilots and the quality of the sensors			0
they report everything that they see			0
' the heavily - armed @entity170 are based at @entity171 as part of the @entity20 ’s @entity173			2

wing commander @entity125 was one of the members of the @entity22 that scared away the @entity3 fighters they are routinely called on to support ground forces across @entity7			1
although the aircraft can use precision weapons such as devastating hellfire missiles to target insurgents , many contacts with the enemy involve using non-lethal shows of force and presence			0
earlier in @entity199 ( @entity198 ) @entity197 were involved in another life - saving operation using the @entity51 pod			0
the device provided @entity7 forces with aerial surveillance of insurgents who were firing on them , pinpointing the enemy 's position to give the @entity209 a tactical advantage during the battle			1
the @entity137 ' missions are commanded by 83 @entity213 , based in the @entity214			0
wing commander @entity215 , chief of staff ( @entity216 ) at 83 @entity213 , said : ' the ied incident is a fantastic example of the @entity22 's flexibility , speed and capability			1
