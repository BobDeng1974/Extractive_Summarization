wearing a black - lace nighty , the escort , who has ' a bird 's nest of wrinkles ' on either side of her eyes , unchains the lock and lets him in			1
' her apartment is lined with @entity176 lights year round , and there 's a mattress with no box spring in the far corner just outside of her bathroom , ' he explains			2
