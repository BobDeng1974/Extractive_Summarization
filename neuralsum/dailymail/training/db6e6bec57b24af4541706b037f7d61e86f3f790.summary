by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 20:34 est , 10 january 2014 it has been the week from hell for @entity4 , the lowest point of a season in which his dream job became a nightmare			1
but the support for him to turn things around for @entity13 should not be limited to those within @entity15			0
every @entity17 coach and manager should be firmly behind @entity19 , hoping he is successful			0
why ? if @entity4 fails , it will be a long time before a @entity17 coach is considered for one of the top jobs			1
harsh though it may sound , it is the truth			0
foreign owners wo n’t be prepared to take a plunge on those who have been ‘ homegrown ’			1
@entity27 shaped : @entity4 has endured a torrid start to his @entity13 reign sequence : @entity13 's defeat at @entity32 in the @entity33 was their third on the bounce @entity4 is at the forefront of a crucial period for our coaches			1
it has not been a common theme in the modern era that , as now , the three biggest jobs in @entity17 football — @entity13 , @entity45 and @entity46 — have simultaneously been held by managers from these shores			1
you have to go back to mid- 1998 , when @entity50 was joined by @entity51 and @entity52 , so it will be intriguing to watch how @entity4 , @entity54 and @entity55 go about achieving their aims			1
make no mistake , they are all under pressure to deliver			0
@entity54 has made excellent progress in his first 18 months at @entity62 but where @entity45 go between now and the end of next year will determine whether he gets the chance to keep building			2
local : @entity54 has made big stride at @entity45 while @entity55 led @entity46 to the @entity67 looking abroad : foreign owners such as @entity69 have been reluctant to appoint @entity17 managers similarly , @entity55 needs @entity46 to give a bold account at the @entity67 this summer			1
he has done a good job since replacing @entity73 but the demands and expectation are relentless			1
he will know what is required for him to stay in charge for @entity79 qualifying			0
we need them to hit their targets to buck the trend of what has happened when @entity17 men have been elevated to the top			2
@entity88 had an opportunity at @entity90 but their owners did n’t believe him to be the man to secure @entity93 football			1
they were criticised for appointing @entity94 but he won the @entity95 and the @entity96 in consecutive years			1
@entity88 is not a lone case			2
@entity98 did n’t last long at @entity99 when his reputation was at its strongest ; @entity55 got 191 days at @entity45			1
brief : @entity98 lasted less than a year at @entity99 after being appointed in 2007 @entity102 : @entity88 was sacked by @entity90 even though they were in top four contention champions : @entity90 won the @entity96 and @entity95 under @entity94 critics have questioned why a @entity17 manager has never been given a platform at @entity108 but they have won 11 major trophies in the @entity69 era , which shows it has worked for them			1
and look at the biggest job of all			2
the @entity95 made a positive step for @entity17 coaches when appointing @entity116 in 2006 but within 18 months , he was sacked after failing to qualify for the @entity117			1
@entity118 and @entity73 took criticism but both qualified for every tournament they could and if @entity55 happens to have a bad time in @entity124 this summer , the clamour will be for the @entity95 to appoint another foreign coach			1
i would n’t want that			0
the @entity46 team should be managed by one of our own but if they are n’t succeeding at club level , you can understand why the @entity95 would be tempted to look abroad			1
it is alarming that only four of the 20 clubs in the @entity96 are managed by englishmen			0
in recent years , only @entity138 has enjoyed success in a big role , reviving @entity141 — a club with a long history of looking abroad — and building their most stylish team in 30 years			2
you can see why clubs have a preference to look abroad , as many managers who come into our game boast impressive cvs			1
whether it is @entity153 or @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 or @entity157 , they all have a pedigree of success and that commands respect straight away			2
there is also a mystique about working with foreign managers			1
i know from experience what it was like with @entity156 and @entity157			0
there would be times in training when they would say something that i did n’t think sounded right but i would never fail to go along with them			0
@entity156 arrived at @entity62 having helped orchestrate @entity174 ’s victory in the @entity175 ; @entity157 had won @entity176 twice with @entity177 and a @entity178			0
those achievements would run through your mind if you ever thought what you were being asked to do was wrong			0
is that something which is working against @entity4 ? for all his good work with @entity186 — stabilising a club that used to be threatened by relegation and turning them into regulars in the top six — he was appointed manager of the league champions after reaching one @entity95 final			1
disaster : @entity46 failed to qualify for @entity196 under @entity116 ( left ) , but foreign managers like @entity118 ( right ) and @entity73 always led the national team to major tournaments expressive : @entity157 arrived at @entity45 having won two @entity176 titles and the @entity178 with @entity177 compare that with @entity50			1
@entity13 were languishing towards the foot of the old @entity204 in 1986 but @entity50 came to @entity15 having led @entity205 to eight domestic honours , as well as the @entity207 and @entity208			0
that is the problem now			0
in the past , @entity17 coaches had a packed cv because they filled all the top jobs , but the influx of foreign coaches has changed that			1
@entity155 , @entity153 and @entity157 have raised the bar and it is up to their @entity17 counterparts to meet the challenge			2
i love having @entity153 and @entity155 in the @entity96 ; i enjoyed it when @entity154 was here and it would be great to one day see @entity224 working his magic , but i am also passionate about seeing @entity17 managers succeed			1
we are quick to shout for their promotion but recent history shows it has n’t worked			0
the onus , then , is on @entity4 , @entity54 and @entity55 to lead the charge and show @entity17 has the talent for the top positions			1
even @entity90 should be glad @entity236 's back i had a chance during a break over @entity239 to read an excellent biography on @entity236 and , by coincidence , finished it the day he made a goalscoring return to action			1
football fans around the world would have been delighted to see him score two goals in @entity251 ’s @entity250 victory over @entity252 and the fact that he is back in action should be celebrated , particularly with the @entity67 looming			2
he will be going to @entity124 fresh and fit			0
even @entity90 players should be happy the @entity258 is back			2
back with a bang : @entity236 returned to the @entity251 team and was straight in the goals against @entity252 test : @entity236 will lead @entity251 into their massive @entity93 tie against @entity90 if i was in the position of @entity266 or any other @entity90 defender , i ’d relish the chance to test myself against @entity236 in the @entity93			2
playing against the best players and competing in the finest arenas — how you do in those games can define your career			0
while i was away , i bumped into @entity224			0
he said that with a fit @entity236 , @entity251 remain the team to beat in the @entity93			0
they have played together for so long and @entity236 gives them the x-factor			0
maybe @entity224 was trying to take some of the pressure off his own @entity280 team , as they attempt to become the first club to retain the @entity93 , but it put into context what we have to look forward to when the competition resumes			0
@entity280 against @entity288 and @entity90 v @entity251 is what top - level football is all about			1
they are games to be savoured			0
@entity292 has suffered terrible luck and will be heartbroken to miss another @entity67 , this time through injury			1
but he is not the first @entity295 to feel cursed when it comes to football ’s biggest tournament , as this week ’s list shows			0
@entity300 — a two - time winner of the @entity302 yet his @entity67 experience lasted just 26 minutes in 1982			1
@entity46 failed to qualify when he was at his best and , to make matters worse , he missed a chance to score against @entity308 that could have put @entity46 into the semi-finals			2
@entity310 — no @entity46 striker has a better goals - to - games ratio than @entity310 ( below )			2
but he scored only one in four matches in @entity314 in 1962 and injury cost him his place in the 1966 final			0
he did n’t get his winners ’ medal until 2009 after the @entity95 campaigned to @entity320 for all sir @entity322 ’s squad to be recognised			0
@entity323 — his first @entity67 appearance could n’t have started better			2
he scored twice against @entity174 in 1982 — one came after 27 seconds — but after that ‘ @entity329 ’ suffered immense frustration as injuries in @entity327 ( 1986 ) and @entity328 ( 1990 ) cut his tournaments short			0
@entity331 — few have given @entity46 better service in the modern era but luck has deserted him at the @entity67			1
he is yet to score in the finals , was ludicrously denied a goal against @entity337 in 2010 and , like me , missed a penalty in the quarter - final shootout against @entity341 in 2006			0
@entity342 — my old team - mate was at his peak in the build - up to @entity174 1998 but he suffered a serious knee injury that ruled him out of the tournament			0
flower ( below ) was selected to go to @entity349 four years later but his only involvement came as a substitute against @entity352 .			0

if @entity4 fails , it will be a long time before a @entity355 is considered for a top job
biggest three jobs in @entity46 are held by home - grown managers
foreign owners *generally* look abroad for managers , like @entity69
@entity88 was sacked by @entity90 , and replacement @entity94 won the league
foreign managers arrive in @entity46 with excellent cvs , like @entity153
@entity55 's @entity46 must give a good showing at @entity67
*unlike* @entity116 , @entity118 and @entity73 qualified for all major tournaments
