it 's not your average playtime scene but this is no ordinary family			1
three - year - old @entity9 and his sister @entity10 , one , are best friends with the world 's fastest land animals - two deadly cheetahs			1
the siblings have formed an extraordinary bond with the creatures after growing up with them in their home in @entity19			1
the children 's parents , managing @entity39 , @entity40 , 29 , and his wife @entity41 adopted two of the cubs the pair think nothing of sharing their toys with the two cheetahs - affectionately known as @entity51 and @entity30 - and can often be found taking their feline friends out for a ride in the family 's mini jeep			1
their parents , @entity41 and @entity58 , are also very close to the cats			1
@entity40 now even teaches the cheetahs to hunt for themselves so as not to alienate them from their natural environment , in the hope they might be reintroduced into the wild one day			1
the remarkable family friendship began a year ago when a wild cheetah living at the @entity36 in the @entity25 of @entity19 gave birth to four cubs			1
@entity70 , @entity40 , 29 , and his wife @entity41 adopted two of the cubs			1
@entity41 , 29 , said : ' i would be warming milk for babies and warming milk for cheetahs			2
i just kept feeding everyone ' @entity41 and @entity40 were stunned to see the extraordinary relationship that formed between the cats and their two young children - then just two years and three months old the couple considered the cubs to be vulnerable because a mother cheetah can usually only provide for half of her litter and mortality rates are highest during the first 16 weeks of life the couple considered them to be vulnerable because a mother cheetah can usually only provide for half of her litter and mortality rates are highest during the first 16 weeks of life			1

@entity41 said : ' the kids were taught not to run anywhere near the cats and when they walk , they have to face them			2
they are not allowed to turn their backs on them ' as @entity113 and @entity30 got older and bigger , @entity41 and @entity40 created a new shelter for them in their back garden where they now live ' they wanted to be close to us because they did n't have a mother and they were so much a part of our family that i would end up having the cheetahs and the kids in bed with me			1
' the kids saw them as completely normal			0
there was no difference in the way they treated the dogs or the cheetahs			0
they cuddled them like big teddy bears			0

but the bond between the toddlers and the cats has remained strong as they have been bought up together - essentially as siblings			0

if the cats jump or pounce , then they just push them down and say " no , do n't do that " , like other children might do to a dog			0
' the cheetahs are wild animals and their instincts are there			0
the kids realise they ca n't just go into the enclosure to play with them whenever they want to			0
