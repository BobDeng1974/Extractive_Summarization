by @entity0 breakthrough : scientists in the @entity3 and @entity4 have been able to grow artificial skin which could replace animals in drug and cosmetics testing in a laboratory artificial skin which could replace animals in drug and cosmetics testing has been grown in a laboratory for the first time			1
scientists in the @entity3 and @entity4 were able to produce one centimetre - wide fragments of epidermis - the outermost skin layer - from stem cells with the same properties as real skin			1
the epidermis forms a protective barrier between the body and external environment , preventing water from escaping while keeping out microbes and toxins			0
until now , tissue engineers have been unable to grow an outer skin layer with the functional barrier needed for drug testing			2
scientists believe that in the future , lab - grown skin could be used for testing medicinal lotions and creams or cosmetics without causing suffering to animals			1
it could also provide a model for investigating skin conditions such as eczema			0
testing cosmetics on animals is banned in the @entity3 and as of last month it is illegal to import or sell products containing ingredients tested on animals within the @entity50			0
however , cosmetics testing continues in other parts of the world , including @entity54 and the @entity4			2
dr @entity55 , who led the @entity3 team from @entity57 , said : ' our new method can be used to grow much greater quantities of lab - grown human epidermal equivalents , and thus could be scaled up for commercial testing of drugs and cosmetics			1
' human epidermal equivalents representing different types of skin could also be grown , depending on the source of the stem cells used , and could thus be tailored to study a range of skin conditions and sensitivities in different populations			1
' the artificial skin was derived from induced pluripotent stem ( @entity75 ) cells created by genetically altering donated fibroblast cells from adult connective tissue			1
@entity79 : scientists believe that in the future , lab - grown skin could be used for testing medicinal lotions and creams or cosmetics without causing suffering to animals @entity75 cells have the same properties as embryonic stem cells , including the ability to develop into virtually any kind of tissue in the body			1
a step - by - step process in the laboratory transformed the ips cells into keratinocytes - the dominant cell type in the outermost layer of the skin - and then pieces of actual skin			1
the scientists called their constructs ' 3d epidermal equivalents '			0
tests showed no significant differences in structure or function between the artificial patches and real human skin			0
dr @entity55 added : ' when you produce a new cream you need to know how much of it goes through the skin , because if there 's too much it can cause damage			2
ambition : dr @entity55 , who led the @entity3 team from @entity57 ( pictured ) said the new method could be scaled up to allow for commercial testing ' if you imagine the skin as a three or four - storey building with a roof on top , other people have made the roof but their roofs are always leaking			1
they could not get their tiles together			0
we are the first to achieve this			0
' our approach is cost - effective , because once you have the @entity75 cells you can grow an infinite number			2
" he said it would be a simple matter to create skin patches measuring 10 square metre rather than one , but pointed out that small fragments might be more useful			0
the research is published in the latest edition of the journal @entity147			0
properties : ips cells have the same properties as embryonic stem cells ( pictured ) , including the ability to develop into virtually any kind of tissue in the body as well as testing drugs and cosmetics , the artificial skin could also be used to study eczema and other conditions that involve the skin failing to provide an effective barrier			1
@entity4 co-author dr @entity163 , from @entity166 veteran affairs @entity164 , said : ' the ability to obtain an unlimited number of genetically identical units can be used to study a range of conditions where the skin 's barrier is defective due to mutations in genes involved in skin barrier formation , such as ichthyosis ( dry , flaky skin ) or atopic dermatitis ( eczema )			2
' we can use this model to study how the skin barrier develops normally , how the barrier is impaired in different diseases and how we can stimulate its repair and recovery			0
