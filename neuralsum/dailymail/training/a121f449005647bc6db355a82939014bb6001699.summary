' it started off with one or two people , then at my first competition it was hundreds , and now thousands			0
' everyday i get messages and letters about how my story has inspired and encouraged others to push through their own barriers and get their lives back on track			2
' i get stopped by people at the gym who want to let me know that because they saw me , they were able to finish that last set , or did n't quit their workout early and go home			1
' when i go hiking i get stopped for photos and handshakes by people who express how they are going to push aside their excuses because they saw me pushing aside mine			0
' and , i 'm constantly contacted by other physically disabled individuals who thought they were the only one			0
' for full video please visit the @entity97 that , he said , is why he was inspired to make a documentary about his own experiences			1

' scaling down the weights and modifying the movements so that i could do them all with one arm			2
' in the last year i decided to stop putting limits on myself , and started to work towards working out at the same level as everyone else			0

' they let all these different fears stop them from doing something			0
