@entity1 striker @entity0 missed a costly penalty as @entity3 surrendered a lead against much - fancied @entity5 in @entity6			1
moments after @entity7 had put @entity3 into the lead , @entity0 was brought down in the box by @entity10 , but blasted his spot - kick against the bar			1
and soon after @entity5 had turned the game on its head , picking up a win their play had scarcely merited			0

@entity17 rounded off the win five minutes from time when his shot from the edge of the box slipped through the dive of @entity55			2
it was harsh on @entity3 , who had defended manfully , and scored an excellent goal of their own			0
@entity7 rounded off a superb passing move , full of first time flicks and clever back - heels , with an emphatic finish			2
and moments later the midfielder turned provider , a blistering run down the right ending with a ball inside for @entity0 , who was brought down by @entity54 inside the box , but the miss sparked @entity5 into life , and there were signs of danger when @entity17 was denied by a brilliant save from @entity110 in the @entity3 goal			1
the keeper did well to first save from @entity17 ’s backheel and then tipped the striker ’s rebound onto the bar and away			0
@entity64 ( right ) challenges @entity5 's @entity54 during the @entity118 match @entity3 's coach @entity119 gestures to his players during monday 's match but he could do nothing about either of the goals , as @entity3 ’s highest ranked side started their campaign with a win			1
many people ’s pre-tournament favourites , @entity5 had started the brighter , controlling the game and dominating possession , but created very little in the way of clear - cut chances			0
@entity134 ’s @entity32 produced a good header from a free kick early on , bringing a save from @entity110 in the @entity139 goal , but for the most part the @entity5 were limited to shots from range			0
@entity38 , the @entity143 winger , had very little impact , and was withdrawn after an hour			0
@entity3 meanwhile were happy to get men behind the ball , utilizing the pace of @entity1 striker @entity0 on the break			1
@entity3 defender @entity57 leaves the pitch on a stretcher after getting injured and it was @entity153 who had the better chances in a low - key first half , @entity157 ’ @entity158 seeing his rocket strike tipped onto the crossbar , before midfielder @entity61 had a close - range shot saved following an intricate passing move			2
@entity0 , despite very little support , was a constant menace for @entity3 , getting in behind the @entity24 defence on several occasions , but never quite able to find the final touch			2
but in the end his energetic display will be forgotten next to the missed penalty that so dented his side ’s chances of progression .			0
