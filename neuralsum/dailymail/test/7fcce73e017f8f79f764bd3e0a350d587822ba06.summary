@entity6 said : ' we are not there yet			2
@entity101 played one game and it ’s good for @entity52 to have many options and to choose the best one			2

that ’s what we want			0
' @entity147 powered home a stoppage time header to earn @entity40 a 2 - 2 draw against @entity7 at @entity151 @entity44 had earlier been on target for @entity7 when the teams met back in december while @entity7 are unlikely to claim the title , they could put another dent in @entity40 's top four ambitions , bruised after their 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity63 before the international break			2
@entity6 said : ' @entity40 is a good side , there is always a good game at the @entity51 and at @entity40 as well			1
