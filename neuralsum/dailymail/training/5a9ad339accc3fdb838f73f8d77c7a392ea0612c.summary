by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 26 april 2013 blame for the child obesity crisis has been laid squarely at the door of coffee shops such as @entity5 – and parents who allow youngsters to snack			1
plain - speaking health minister @entity9 accused coffee chains of tempting children with large syrup - laden coffees topped with marshmallows and cream , followed by an enormous muffin			1
she warned that young people have no idea how many calories they consume because most outlets do not provide such details on their walls			1
frothy coffees and mid-morning muffins have been blamed for fuelling @entity25 's obesity crisis by health minister @entity9 miss @entity9 , 56 , said : ‘ i have no problem with coffee shops , but young people go in and have a large coffee – not a small one – which has syrup in it			1
‘ it might have marshmallows on top , and then perhaps another little dollop of cream , because it is just a snack , a treat or elevenses			1
‘ “ and by the way ” , they say , “ i think i ’ll have one of those very nice muffins ”			2
they do not know how many calories that is			2
’ the minister also accused parents of failing to teach their children not to eat between meals			0
‘ let us talk about something that did not exist when i was young – the concept of snacking , ’ she said			2
‘ i was positively told not to eat between meals			2
ms @entity9 warned young people do not know how many calories there are in the ' dollop of cream ' on their drinks ‘ if we now look in the real world at how young people live and at what they feel is acceptable , it includes going into the many coffee shops that exist			1
’ almost a third of children are currently overweight or even obese – so fat their health is in danger			0
miss @entity9 has previously attacked bakeries for selling cakes and croissants that are too large , and has called for supermarkets and restaurants to reduce portion sizes			1
she warned that child obesity not only costs the @entity75 lots of money , but also costs in ‘ human terms ’			0
‘ many of us who see children who are overweight or obese are upset and concerned about that , because we know that many of those children will not only suffer from health issues , but will be bullied , ’ she said			0
the minister added that people of all ages needed to be better at counting calories but said she did not want to ‘ demonise ’ any food			1
she recalled that the concept of ‘ snacking ’ simply did not exist when she was young , and that she was told in no uncertain terms by her mother and father that she should only eat at mealtimes			1
miss @entity9 , the public health minister , made her comments just days after claiming the prime minister only gave her the job because she was a woman			1
she told @entity100 that her position was seen by many as a ‘ soft girly ’ job , and was concerned that @entity104 had seen fit to give it to ‘ the girl again ’			2
almost a third of children are currently overweight or even obese – so fat their health is in danger			0
the minister has previously attacked bakeries for selling cakes and croissants which were too large , and has called for supermarkets and restaurants to do more to reduce portion sizes			2
in the @entity118 debate on wednesday , miss @entity9 said child obesity was such a problem because youngsters were much more likely to eat between meals than those of her own generation			1
she said the proliferation of coffee shops such as @entity5 , @entity127 and @entity128 on @entity25 ’s high streets were making the problem worse , because they were popular with young people			1
‘ let us talk about something that did not exist when i was young — the concept of snacking , ’ she said			2
‘ i was positively told not to eat between meals			2
if we now look in the real world at how young people live and at what they feel is acceptable , it includes going into the many coffee shops that exist			1
' the straight - talking minister said that when she was young she was told not to eat between meals the minister ’s attack on coffee stores like @entity5 is just the latest criticism of the company , which has been accused of not paying corporation tax , and refusing to filter out porn from its public wi - fi system – putting children at risk			1
the firm has since imposed a filter			0
miss @entity9 warned that not only did child obesity cost the @entity75 lots of money , it also costs in ‘ human terms ’			1
are coffee shops at fault for @entity25 's child obesity crisis ? ‘ many of us who see children who are overweight or obese are upset and concerned about that , because we know that many of those children will not only suffer from health issues , but will be bullied			0
‘ many of them are unhappy that they can not , as they perceive it , join in the sport or physical activity enjoyed by their friends			0
there is a real human cost to overweightness and obesity			0
’ the minister also refused to backtrack on comments made earlier this year – and widely criticised at the time – that it was possible to tell which children were poorer because they tended to be fatter			0
she said : ‘ we know that 12.3 per cent of reception children who are overweight or obese are from the most deprived backgrounds , as opposed to 6.8 per cent who are from the least deprived backgrounds			0
‘ i do not know why , but we can not use the word “ poor ” anymore			0
by year six , 24.3 per cent of overweight and obese children are from the most deprived backgrounds , compared with 13.7 per cent from the least deprived backgrounds			0
‘ i hope that those facts speak loudly , and i also hope that everybody takes this away : the reason why i feel this way with such a passion is that if someone comes from a poor , deprived background , they have enough problems as a child , and enough bad things going against them to prevent them from having a great start in life , without the burden of being overweight or obese			0
’ the minister said people of all ages needed to be much better at counting their calories			1
‘ it is a surprise to people — even to supposedly intelligent , grown - up people such as ourselves — when they find out the calorific content of foods that we see and perceive as treats and snacks , ’ she said			0
‘ equally , i want to make it clear that we should never demonise any food			0
there is nothing wrong with chips , or burgers ; what is important is that it is all good food in moderation			0
’ miss @entity9 , a former presenter of @entity230 , is making a career out of courting controversy			1
soon after taking office she provoked anger by saying she supported the legalisation of assisted dying .			0

@entity9 says that when she was young she was told not to snack
young people do not know how many calories there are in hot drinks
