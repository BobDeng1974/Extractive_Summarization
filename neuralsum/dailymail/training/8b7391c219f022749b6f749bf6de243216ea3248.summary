a row has broken out in a @entity2 supermarket where @entity4 workers were told to stop speaking their native language and address customers in @entity7			1
staff at the store in @entity10 , @entity11 , say they were banned from conversing in @entity4 during their breaks and told to only speak @entity7 on the shop floor			1
but workers have hit back at bosses - insisting many of their customers only speak @entity4 and do not understand @entity7			1
@entity2 in @entity10 , @entity11 is at the centre of a row after @entity4 workers hit out at being told to speak @entity7 one member of staff , who asked to remain anonymous , said : ' i tried to explain to the manager that many customers who do not speak @entity7 correctly come to our shop because they know there is a @entity4 service at the cash desk , bakery and shop floor as well			1
' the manager became irritated and told me to carry out his orders			0
' the worker said they were told they 'd be sent home if they were heard speaking their own language again			0
the worker added : ' i have been living @entity42 for nearly 10 years and i have never experienced any kind of discrimination			0
' it is very sad to be forced to be forced to speak @entity7 to people who do not understand it and feel confused as they expect to be served in @entity4			1
' the issue has sparked a row in the @entity42 town , which has a large @entity4 community and recently hosted its own festival of @entity4 culture			2
a petition at ' the @entity4 shop ' in the town 's @entity56 has gathered 100 signatures and @entity2 workers intend to forward it to the firm 's @entity62 headquarters in @entity64			1
the store insists it is company policy that all staff speak @entity7 ' for the benefit of all customers ' one @entity4 customer , 35 , said : ' i think this is one of the most ridiculous ideas i have ever heard in my life			1
' i can not imagine an opposite situation , where a @entity77 worker is not allowed to speak to a @entity77 customer in the @entity7 anywhere in @entity62			2
' a @entity2 spokesman said : ' we understand that in certain regions of the @entity77 there are other official languages in use and we welcome the use of these in our stores			0
' we also ask that , if possible , our staff respond to customers in the language in which they are addressed			0
' we do have a general policy in the @entity77 stating that we carry out our working communication in @entity7 , such as when speaking to fellow employees on the shop floor			2
' as a business we have to have this in place to help reduce misunderstandings and encourage the building of good relationships across the business and with customers			0
