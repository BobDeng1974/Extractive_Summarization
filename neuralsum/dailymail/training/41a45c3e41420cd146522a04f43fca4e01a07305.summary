by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 13:27 est , 12 october 2012 a man has spoken out on this morning to tell of his 10 year addiction to @entity3 - despite being in his early thirties and never having suffered from serious erection issues			1
@entity6 , who works in the music industry , says he first tried @entity3 age 20 , when a friend offered him some during a big night out abroad			1
the group had been drinking heavily , but wanted to take girls back to their hotel room			2
fearful of being unable to perform to the best of his abilities , when a friend offered him @entity3 , he accepted			1
addicted : after first taking it at the age of 20 to enable him to drink heavily and still perform , @entity6 found he was relying on @entity3 for every encounter ' my friend said to me , " i ’ve got something - take this			1
" he told me what it was and what it would do			2
we took what we needed to take and it did exactly what it said on the bottle			2
' from then on , @entity6 says things progressed until he became addicted to the pills - taking them every time he was with a woman - which given his ' eccentric ' lifestyle was with unusual frequency			1
' i had never really had problems as such , ' he says			0
' but when you 're under the influence , and with the life i lead ... a lot of the time you meet women and your mind is on other things - but you meet women who will come back with you and expect something			1
you need to fulfil that			0
' ‘ i can remember the last time i did n’t have it , but it 's always been around			0
i feel more comfortable with it around me than if it 's not			0
i ’ve always had it – first started taking when i was abroad – in @entity59 , @entity60			1
whenever we go away we take a stockpile			0
i used to take a lot more , but now it depends on the situation and how i feel			0
if i 'm intoxicated then i ’m definitely going to need it			0
' @entity6 says this sort of frequent reliance on @entity3 - a crutch for his crotch , as @entity70 puts it - it very common among his friends , who are also in their twenties and thirties			1
this @entity75 's medical expert doctor @entity74 warns that while @entity3 is a very safe drug that can help many men and save marriages , taking any medication when it has n't been prescribed by a doctor and is n't necessary comes with risks and side effects			1
' having difficulty getting an erection is a very common problem when you 're tired , stressed , under the influence of alcohol			1
for a young man with no serious problems , a healthy lifestyle , reducing stress and getting more sleep should provide a solution			1
desperate to quit : dr @entity74 says for a young man like @entity6 , healthy living , plenty of sleep and stress reduction should cure any bedroom issues ' that ’s what i want to do , ' says @entity6			1
' cut everything out – but what comes with my life and the industry i ’m in – i have more female friends than male , ' he confesses			0
' i find it hard to be on my own			0
and @entity3 is always readily available			1
you can buy it online , or i can call friends			0
they ’re even selling substitutes to @entity3 in service stations now			1
' ' that 's where i see the red flag , ' says dr @entity74			0
when you say that friends are supplying the drug or it is coming from the internet or overseas			2
' if you do n’t need the medication , the risks outweigh the benefits			0
' @entity6 , who says he has been taking @entity3 for 10 to 12 years on a regular basis - and now spends around £ 1,000 a year on the pills - admits that he experiences unpleasant side effects after taking a tablet - but fears about pleasing his partners prevent him from quitting			1
' i 'm a great worrier , ' he says			0
' but now when i take the tablets i can hear my heartbeat and i can feel palpitations , ' he says			2
there 's a ringing in my ears too - i 'm not sure if it comes from the loud music i 'm always around or the @entity3 , but it always comes after i take the tablets			1
' ' hearing loss is a possible side effect , says dr @entity74 , ' although it is a rare one			0
the truth is , when used correctly it is a very safe drug			2
he advises that anyone with erectile problems or concerns about their performance should visit their gp			2
' if things have n’t worked on one occasion men can start worrying and develop performance anxiety - but that their first port of call should always be their doctor			1
used correctly and when needed , @entity3 is a perfectly safe and very useful drug , says dr @entity74 ' it may mean medication , it may mean psychosexual counselling , it may mean a lifestyle change , ' he says			1
with regards to @entity6 , dr @entity74 says that given that everything is in full working order , he should stop taking the tablet			1
' his kit works - but he gets a psychological boost from having it on board , ' he says			2
' consider not using it - your relationships will be more fulfilling and your health will be protected			2
' the important thing is that we do n’t let people think it ’s normal behaviour and put themselves at risk – slim risk , but still at risk			0
' you have to be careful of some of the herbal alternatives too : some actually have conventional drugs in them – and that ’s why they work			0
' ' i want to stop it all , ' says @entity6			1
‘ i have had the opportunity to be where i want to be , to settle down			0
i 'm trying to live in a different way , i ’m weaning myself off			0
’ dr @entity74 has the last word : ' honestly , what really works is leading a healthy lifestyle , have a nice romantic evening , and things are likely to go to plan			2
if not , do n’t be embarrassed , see your doctor			0
more often than not you can get to the bottom of it			0
