the 16 - year - old gymnast became an internet sensation after failing to hide her anger over a tumble during the @entity4 online comedians have photoshopped her disgruntled facial expression into all sorts of hilarious scenarios the look was seen again when the ' @entity10 ' appeared on @entity11 two days ago by @entity12 published : 17:12 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 02:11 est , 20 august 2012 it 's the face that has taken the internet by storm - and now it seems that @entity18 's unimpressed pout has spread to television screens			1
the 16 - year - old @entity4 gymnast became the focus of online comedians when she failed to hide her anger over an embarrassing tumble during the @entity25			1
but the pretty brunette has proved her sense of humour , again , by making the same face during an appearance on @entity11 two days ago			1
posing as interns , she and her ' @entity10 ' teammates performed a series of impressive gymnastics tricks before coming together to smile and wave to the audience as a group			1
but while the other girls were noticeably beaming , miss @entity18 barely managed a smile , lifting her arm up only slightly to offer a half - hearted wave			2
the team posed as @entity47 's interns during the episode not happy : her face was made famous when she accepted a silver medal during the @entity4 , above clearly playing up to her fans who ca n't seem to get enough of the disgruntled look , and have , as a result , photoshopped photos of hers in several hilarious scenarios online , she stayed in character during the groups ' entire appearance			1
it follows the equally - funny picture she posted of herself on @entity64 last week that captured her and fellow @entity66 gymnasts @entity67 and @entity68 pulling the notorious face			2
during the @entity47 episode , which aired on wednesday night , the @entity66 gymnastics team which also consists of @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , each posed as the host 's eager assistants			0
in a highly - amusing comedy sketch , the five teens are seen back - flipping , cartwheeling and hand - standing their way over to the show 's host from behind the curtains in order to drop off a pen to his desk			2
demanding : @entity91 's ' @entity10 ' @entity4 gymnastics team have appeared on @entity11 where host @entity47 ( above ) asked the teenagers to deliver a pen to him			1
they do so in spectacular style work it : a @entity47 crew member ( left ) offered the pen to the ' interns '			0
@entity75 ( right ) snapped it up first mr @entity47 starts out by telling his audience that he has ' a new batch of interns and they might be the best ones to date '			0
' five bright young women who just returned from some kind of study abroad program in @entity109 , ' he continues			0
' anyway , they 're very helpful and , you know what , speaking of which , i do n't have my pen ... could somebody bring me my pen please ? ' @entity117 ' the intern ' , who looks to be just one of the show 's crew members , then holds a pen out in the air before saying : can you get this to @entity47 ? ' miss @entity75 , 16 , pops out on the stage , snapping the pen up from @entity117 's hands before striking a pose for the camera which sends the unsuspecting audience wild with delight as they begin to realise who the host 's new interns are			2
skills : miss @entity75 launches into an impressive cartwheel after she lodges the pen between her teeth passing it on : like a relay baton , miss @entity75 passes the pen onto @entity18 before she somersaults impressive : miss @entity144 ( left ) is seen performing a fantastic somersault before landing in a perfect dismount success : miss @entity18 then passes the pen onto @entity68 ( right ) who uses it to spin and high - kick the @entity75 then lodges the pen between her teeth as she takes to the floor to perform a cartwheel before passing the pen over to @entity18 , 16 , who has just popped out from behind another curtain			1
as the crowd continues to cheer and clap , miss @entity18 lodges the pen between her own teeth and proceeds to perform a somersault on a long mat that has been spread across the ground			0
the teen dismounts perfectly , taking the pen out from her teeth before placing a hand on her hip to strike her own pose towards the audience			0
@entity68 , 18 , then takes centre stage , who performs two spins with the same pen , given to her by @entity176 , in her hand and then a high kick			0
as she performs , mr @entity47 is shown , glued to the girls ' every move as though he were watching them compete at the @entity4 once again			1
continues : miss @entity68 ( right ) then passes the all - important pen onto 15 - year - old @entity67 ( right ) back - flip : miss @entity67 performs a double back - flip on another mat that has been laid onto the studio floor finally : the pen is then passed to @entity187 ( left ) who proceeds to stand on her hands and walk to the host @entity67 , 15 , then takes the pen from @entity176 before placing the pen between her own teeth and launching into an impressive double back - flip performance on another mat that has been laid out			1
finally , @entity74 , 17 , takes the pen herself and slips it between her toes , stepping into a walking handstand that ends with the show 's host snatching it from her foot as it comes towards him			0
the comedian then launches into his own comical dismount , which attracts a standing ovation from the excited crowd			0
the end : the tv host reaches out for the pen , which is lodged between miss @entity74 's foot ( pictured ) @entity210 completed : mr @entity47 launches into his own ridiculous dismount as he takes hold of the pen @entity10 : the entire squad then comes together to wave to the audience who offer a rousing applause the five girls then take to the centre of the stage in order to wave to the crowd as a team united , much like the scene at their gold medal presentation ceremony in @entity109			1
a close - up of miss @entity18 shows a sour expression as she stays in character with the low - level intern she is portraying			2
to top the entertainment off , the camera then rolls over to the girls ' mothers including miss @entity75 ' mom @entity233 , who pretend to be asleep in the audience			0
sticking together : the group were photographed atop the @entity236 ( above ) two days ago ' that was beautiful , ' the host concludes before noting that he actually wanted a black pen , not the blue one that was delivered to him			1
the team are currently in the thick of a jam - packed publicity schedule that has seen some of its members appear on other talk shows and breakfast programs			0
the @entity249 more : @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252			0
