by @entity0 splashed out on a new sheer summer dress ? dug out those white trousers for the weekend ? then you , like me , risk the scourge of sunshine dressing : the dreaded @entity7 ( @entity7 )			1
while winter woollies and thick fabrics hide all manner of underwear sins , your summer wardrobe is another matter entirely			1
@entity7 was cited as @entity15 supermodel @entity14 ’s pet hate this week , when she advised women of a certain age to spend as much time looking in a rear view mirror before leaving the house , as they do in their bathroom one			1
but how do you banish @entity7 ? the good news is there ’s an astonishing array of ‘ invisible ’ knickers said to be undetectable beneath even the flimsiest of clothing			1
summer scourge : @entity30 is n't loving this unsightly case of @entity7 but are these new breed of second skin undies really as effective as they are claimed to be ? i road - tested 12 pairs ranging from £ 3 to £ 75 under a sheer frock and a pair of tight white trousers to find out which work and which do n’t			1
@entity41 and @entity42 , £ 3 , @entity43 these are a hipster style with a generous cut where it counts across the rear			2
the material has been laser cut so there are no seams , meaning the knickers sit flat against the skin			1
the lace panel might show up under some dresses but was totally invisible under light - coloured trousers			1
great value , too — i ’m stocking up			2
score : 5/5 @entity61 in camel , £ 9 , sockshop.co.uk i tried the shimmery caramel shade , which was a little dark for my skin tone but would look very natural against tanned skin			2
these have laser cut , scalloped edges at the back to avoid the seams that can give that tell - tale line under clothes and there ’s no label to get in the way either — the washing instructions are printed on the fabric instead			1
but they are let down by the vertical back seam visible beneath the sheer dress			2
quite tight and high cut at the back so i had to go up a size to a size 12 to stop them digging in and creating two bottoms			2
score : 3/5 @entity87 cotton no vpl @entity88 with stretch , £ 6 , marksandspencer.com great everyday knickers if you are more of a @entity92 than a @entity93 in the rump stakes			1
the lace at the back gives discreet , reassuring coverage without leaving a line			0
these comfy smalls were totally invisible under white trousers , though you could see a lacy shadow in places beneath the dress			1
they were the most flattering by far , and cotton , too , so cool for summer			1
@entity60 : 4.5/5 @entity107 seam - free full briefs , £ 5 for three , primark.com @entity110 , eat your heart out			1
these are definitely in the passion killer category of big pants			0
but they are seamless and label - free so they give a smooth finish and are very soft — and reassuring if you like a high - cut style that covers the tummy			1
the leg trim could be seen beneath the sheer dress , but there was no vpl under the white trousers			0
score : 3/5 @entity125 , £ 10 , ultimo.co.uk avoid these teeny tiny knickers unless you have a teeny tiny bottom			1
there are no seams but the fabric was so tight fitting , even in a larger size , it pressed against my skin leaving unsightly bulges			0
these smallest of smalls confirmed all my worst fears about wearing a thong at my age			0
they were tight , hideously unflattering and within minutes i felt like i was being spliced with cheesewire			0
score : 1/5 @entity144 , £ 25 , houseoffraser.co.uk these are white with pale pink trim			0
the back panel is made in a very fine , seamless netting which does n’t cling and they are generously cut so that you feel you are wearing something substantial rather than simply wobbling about unsupported			0
sadly , the white fabric showed up beneath the sheer dress , but they ’re great for jeans			0
score : 4/5 @entity156 , £ 15 , triumph.com a pretty design that ’s less skimpy than most and therefore much more flattering			0
smooth across the bottom but the seams at the leg are quite bulky and so sadly were still visible beneath the white cropped trousers as well as under my favourite cream dress , which was disappointing			0
had an unsightly label , too , that i had to cut out			0
@entity60 : 2.5/5 studio @entity165 , £ 24 , houseoffraser.co.uk these come in a dark nude shade that would best suit darker skin tones			0
quite skimpy on , so not great for containing curves and i found they rode up at the back when worn			0
i had no lines across the bottom cheeks but the sides were quite narrow , and , in my usual size , dug in to my hips creating unsightly bulges			0
bafflingly , they ’re also hand - wash only			1
@entity60 : 1.5/5 @entity181 no - show @entity180 , £ 11 low cut at the front so there ’s the risk of a muffin overspill , but the soft , stretchy fabric mercifully does n’t dig into love handles at the back or sides so they are not too torturous to wear			1
they ’re great under white jeans , and invisible under the dress , but they wo n’t protect against cheek - wobble under a floaty skirt , so are only for the brave / under - 30s/flat - bottomed			1
@entity60 : 4.5/5 next no vpl shorts , £ 12 for a three - pack these are not attractive			2
they look like hot pants and that ’s only a good thing if you are @entity206			2
but they did prove to be invisible under the sheer dress and gave some coverage and wobble - protection			1
sadly let down by the back seam and label , which could be seen under the white trousers			0
@entity60 : 4.5/5 @entity214 , £ 75 , wolford.com these transparent control shorts are not at all pretty , but they were totally invisible under both the sheer dresses and the white trousers , and as an added bonus they kept all my wobbly bits in place			2
there are no seams so they do n’t dig in to the upper thigh or waist			0
just do n’t wear them on a windy day or your skirt might flap up and reveal your secret			0
they ’re seriously expensive , but could prove an indispensable addition to your summer armoury if you need a little extra help			2
score : 5/5 @entity233 with no vpl , £ 19.50 , marksandspencer.com tummy control pants can be the worst for digging in across the bottom , but these big beauties have seamless mesh panels at the top of the thigh and across the rear so that they lie flat against the skin and are completely invisible			2
they cinched in the waist well , but its best to go up a size to avoid a roll of fat being pushed downwards to the upper thigh			0
