and he has long faced ethics questions about his relationship with @entity16 eye doctor @entity15 , a wealthy and prolific donor			1
the senator 's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the @entity20 on his friend 's behalf , pushing back against accusations of overbilling the @entity20 system by $ 8.9 million			1

' ' any actions taken by @entity53 or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason			0
' ' the senator has counted dr. @entity15 as one of his closest personal friends for decades , ' @entity44 said			2
' the two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other ’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts			0
' @entity66 : attorney general @entity67 would n't talk on friday about whether charges are forthcoming for @entity2 , saying ' i ca n't comment ' she called the investigation 's beginnings ' suspect , ' referring to ' false allegations ' that have been ' discredited ' in the past			1

on a new website called @entity80 , the group claims he ' unethically , and likely criminally , compromised his ability to represent the people of @entity4			0
' @entity83 reported that the investigation into @entity2 is reaching a crescendo , with prosecutors under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out on some charges			0
attorney general @entity67 , according to the network , has already given his approval			2
but he insisted ' i ca n't comment on that ' when a reporter asked him about the report friday afternoon after @entity9 gave a speech in @entity99			1
@entity2 's first high - level meeting at @entity101 related to @entity15 's @entity20 troubles occurred on june 7 , 2012 , according to court documents seen by the @entity104			1

' i have to be honest with you , ' @entity2 said during a january 21 @entity153 hearing			0
' the more i hear from the administration and its quotes , the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of @entity158			0
' while he is not among the senate 's super-rich elites , the @entity4 legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges : his legal defense fund has already collected , and spent , more than $ 1 million			2

the x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband			0
@entity224 - politics : dr. @entity15 controlled a company that wanted a @entity28 ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs			1
@entity2 allegedly helped ensure the @entity174 would n't provide the machines for free in 2013 @entity232 agents and investigators from @entity101 raided @entity15 's @entity234 , @entity16 medical office , @entity236			1
over a period of nearly 24 hours , then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing whatnews reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files			0
the @entity243 reported at the time that @entity101 auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments @entity15 's practice billed to @entity20			1
