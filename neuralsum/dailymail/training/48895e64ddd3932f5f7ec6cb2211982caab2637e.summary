by @entity0 for @entity1 just when you thought @entity4 had done spending , they sign @entity6			1
the @entity9 striker 's £ 12million loan deal from @entity10 adds to an incredible list of buys , including £ 60m @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
but after a summer of huge transfers , how can the club still splurge even more ? @entity18 explains ... there 's been lots of talk about how @entity4 can possible afford to spend up to £ 200m in the window			1
how can they ? when the dust settles it wo n’t be quite as big a figure as that			0
the fees combined for @entity13 , @entity29 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity30 , @entity31 and the loan fee for @entity6 will total around £ 150m			1
but a few sales , including @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and others , will bring net spend closer to £ 120m			2
that ’s still huge , but not as huge as at first glance			0
new boy : @entity6 ( with his wife , @entity42 ) has joined @entity4 on a season - long loan expensive twelve months : @entity6 has left @entity10 to join the @entity44 for one year for a fee of £ 12m fine , but £ 120m or anywhere close is still a gobsmacking sum			1
how can they afford that ? @entity4 are , by far , the biggest earners in @entity53 football , and they make big ‘ headline ’ profits			2
the latest available full accounts , for 2012 - 13 , showed income of £ 363m and gross profit £ 146m , albeit before debt servicing			1
for 2013 - 14 , @entity4 ’s income will have been around £ 430m , with big profits			1
in 2014 - 15 , they are expected to have total income of £ 500m or more , by which time they should have recaptured their title of the richest club in the world ( measured by income ) from @entity68 and @entity69			2
how is their income growing so quickly ? of three main revenue streams - match - day income , commercial and broadcasting - the first is stable and the other two are soaring			0
new deals with @entity75 and adidas alone will boost @entity4 ’s income by £ 80m a year			1
global commercial deals , with everyone from noodle suppliers to paint manufacturers and mobile firms , are booming			0
if it can be monetised , @entity4 are doing it			2
and tv cash is growing , for them more than most			0
the shirt fits : @entity75 agreed a huge deal to sponsor @entity4 's kit , which started this season product placement : an advert released last year featuring @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 but are n’t big profits just wiped out by the massive debt repayments necessary to service the loans taken out in the @entity99 family ’s 2005 ‘ leveraged ’ buyout ? only to an extent			1
the last set of financial accounts , for example , showed annual debt - related payments were an eye - watering £ 71m for the year in interest , debt restructuring and repayments			1
that ’s £ 1.37m a week , or £ 195,000 a day , or £ 8,127 every hour			0
but that still leaves tens of millions spare			0
that ‘ spare ’ sum is growing by the year			0
total debt is down from around £ 550m back then to ‘ only ' £ 389m and falling			2
@entity4 ’s accounts also show there has been a ‘ spare ’ pot of cash of around £ 100m in the bank for the past few years , available to be spent			2
it ’s being spent now			0
money men : the @entity99 family floated stock in @entity4 on the @entity123 in 2012 still , is it sustainable ? can they keep spending at these levels ? they wo n’t be able to spend £ 120m net every year			1
the point of doing it this time is they have needed to redress the under - spending of the past few years			0
they also need to get back into the @entity136 , which plugs them back into another revenue stream , worth £ 50m a year , give or take			0
in some ways spending now is an attempt to guarantee bigger future income			0
record breaker : @entity13 ( posing in front of a @entity75 ) joined @entity4 last week for £ 60m			1

@entity4 have signed @entity6 on loan from @entity10
shock *deadline* day signing is just latest player to arrive this summer
@entity13 was @entity151 transfer record buy at £ *60million*
@entity4 have huge financial *resources* but are *heavily* in debt following @entity99 family 's *takeover* in 2005
united total spend could reach £ 200m
