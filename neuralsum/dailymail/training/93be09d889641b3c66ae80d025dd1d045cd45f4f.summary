by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 13:12 est , 11 april 2013 @entity1 , from @entity2 , fell to his death from the undercarriage of an aeroplane ten miles from @entity5 detectives have identified the man whose body fell onto a suburban @entity10 road from the under carriage of a plane flying to @entity5 last year			1
@entity13 , 30 , from @entity2 , was found in @entity14 , @entity15 , in september but the @entity16 struggled to identify him			1
detectives analysed a sim card found in his jeans and contacted the phone numbers that were stored on it			1
they were able to extract and contact telephone numbers from the card as part of the ' complex inquiry '			1
they had originally thought he was @entity28 because of currency found in his pockets and the fact that a flight from @entity33 , @entity28 , had passed over shortly before the body was found			2
however , he was not a member of air crew or a passenger			0
officers are now working with authorities in @entity2 to try to find his next of kin			1
an inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned			0
a @entity45 spokesman said they are ' satisfied ' the man is mr @entity1 and said they had been able to identify him as ' new information has recently come to light '			1
in december , police released images of the man in a bid to identify him			2
his body was found shortly in the suburban road , ten miles from the airport , before 8am on september 9			1
a post mortem held at @entity61 gave the cause of death as multiple injuries			0
aviation experts said at the time that the man was probably dead before he hit the ground either because he had been crushed by the retracting landing gear shortly after the plane took off , or because of the extreme cold at high altitude			2
detectives initially believed mr @entity1 was from @entity28 as he had the country 's currency on him when he was found in the street in @entity15 , pictured one resident said in september : ‘ it is unbelievable			1
the first thing i thought when i saw the body was that it must have fallen from quite a height			2
' mr @entity1 was wearing jeans , a grey hoody and white trainers when he fell , and had a tattoo on his left arm of a distinctive emblem with the letters ' z ' and ' g ' clearly visible			0
a @entity91 spokesman said a stowaway in an aircraft undercarriage was unlikely to survive as he would either be crushed by the wheels after take - off or freeze in temperatures as low as minus @entity96 ( minus @entity97 )			0
he said last year : ‘ the chances of survival for a stowaway are very slim , particularly in the recess of the landing gear			0
‘ i do n’t know of anyone who has survived being stowed away on a long - haul flight			0
‘ when the landing gear comes down at the other end , a few miles from the runway and about 2,000ft in the air , if there is a person who had died they would fall out			0
’ aviation experts say mr @entity1 was probably dead before he hit the ground either from cold or from being crushed by the wheels after take off ( file picture )			0
