by @entity0 published : 05:27 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 07:09 est , 26 march 2012 at 3ft9 " @entity1 is not much taller than her six - year - old son @entity2 when @entity3 arrives at her son 's school each afternoon she 's just another mother waiting at the playground gates			1
but when her son @entity2 rushes outside to meet her he knows he has to be careful - because at 3ft tall he is only nine inches shorter than she is			2
' he 's very active but he instinctively knows he ca n't be too boisterous around me , ' @entity1 said			1
' it 's tricky though because he thinks because he 's nearly my size that makes him a grown - up ! ' @entity1 , 25 , from @entity14 , has a severe form of @entity16 , more commonly known as brittle bones disease			1
the hereditary condition means her body does n't produce enough collagen - the ' cement ' that provides bones with strength and flexibility			2
without sufficient levels the bones develop holes and fracture easily			2
it means @entity1 can break a rib just by sneezing or if a friend hugs her too tightly			1
' when i was 22 my friend cuddled me and it broke one of my ribs			1
she was mortified but i thought it was funny			2
i have to accept i ca n't stop things breaking , ' she said			2
but ms @entity3 's positive attitude ca n't disguise the fact she is almost constantly in pain and only finds relief when lying in a hot bath			2
' it '' s mind over matter , ' she said			2
' i 've always had it so i 've never known any different			2
i cope with it because there 's no other choice			2
' she admits she finds it frustrating having to ask friends to help her every time she need to go to the supermarket as she ca n't risk carrying anything heavy			2
' i must think ahead all the time about possible hazards			2
if it 's icy then i ca n't walk or if there 's a slippery floor i need to use my wheelchair , ' she added			2
she also finds clothes shopping ' terrible ' as she wears the equivalent to a child 's size age six			1
' i want to dress like everyone else so i often buy tops at @entity68 and wear them as dresses , ' she said			0
' but i ca n't wear heels in case i fall over			0
' @entity1 must also deal with upsetting encounters with thoughtless strangers			1
she said : ' i was once at a cash point and the woman behind me was really close , so i looked around and asked her what she wanted			0
' and she said " oh sorry , i thought you were playing with it			0
" she thought i was a child			1
' @entity1 has learned to adapt to her condition and says she is determined to live her life ' properly			1
' the whites of her eyes are tinged blue , which is another sign of brittle bones @entity1 broke her first bone on the day she was born , after she suffered a femur fracture during delivery			1
both her mother and sister have less severe forms of the condition so doctors quickly realised she had brittle bones			1
she was wheel - chair bound until she was 14 because every time she tried to walk she would break something			0
however , she finally managed to start walking after having physiotherapy every day at school			1
despite her difficulties @entity1 was never bullied at school			1
' i was brought up to feel no different from anyone else so i was never insecure or embarrassed about my condition , ' she said			0
this determination to live her own life led her to make the risky decision to have a baby when she was 19			0
' everyone told me not to consider having a baby but i just knew i could manage it , ' she said			0
' when i became pregnant some family members were so scared for me they asked me to consider an abortion but i would never do that			0
' when i was 27 weeks i fell over and broke my leg so had to stay in a wheel chair			1
but it was n't until 35 weeks that i had an elective caesarean at the @entity116			0
' because @entity2 was premature he had to go to intensive care for two weeks before i could take him home			0
' doctors had warned @entity1 not to become pregnant but she said she ' knew ' she would be able to cope ongoing battle : @entity1 has experienced frequent fractures since childhood ( left ) her latest operation fixed a plate to strengthen her right thigh bone ( right ) after three months doctors said @entity2 had not inherited her condition			1
' now i 'm older i would only have another child if i could be sure they did n't carry the defective gene , ' @entity1 said			1
life with brittle bones and a child has proved something of a challenge for @entity1			1
' when he was 18months i could n't pick him up any more so if he cried i would sit with him instead			0
i had to tell family not to pick him up or he would expect it all the time , ' she said			0
' we had to adapt			0
instead of lifting him into the buggy i would ask him to climb in			0
he also learned early on how to stand on a block to get himself a drink			0
' by the time he was five he knew how to call 999 if i had an emergency or to get to my mother 's house nearby to get help			1
' the school has also been good in helping me teach him not to run across the road and to listen			0
' he does n't really understand my condition - i think he just thinks i have a permanently broken leg so that 's why i ca n't play football			0
' @entity1 says she finds it most distressing if other adults assume she is a child when she is with her son			1
' i was with @entity2 at @entity159 and a woman asked us " are you looking forward to santa coming ? " ' and i said " well i am for him , but i think i 'm a bit old for all that			0
" ' i hate it if i 'm with @entity2 because i think they set a bad example and i 'm trying to teach him the right way to behave			1
' @entity1 following her osteotomy in july 2011			1
it will take her body at least 18months to heal @entity1 has undergone a number of operations to treat her condition			1
most recently she had an osteotomy , which is to be featured on @entity179 's documentary series @entity178 tonight			0
' i had broken my femur ( thigh bone ) 30 times and it had healed in a crooked position so last year doctors deliberately broke the bone and straightened it before putting in a plate , ' she said			1
' this should fix it in the right position			0
it is healing slowly but it takes me at least twice as long as normal to recover			0
' despite all her setbacks @entity1 , who is an ambassador for the @entity16 society remains bubbly and upbeat			1
' i just think there is always someone worse than you , ' she said			0
' i wo n't die from this condition and i 've learned there is no point not living my life properly as something will always break anyway			0
six months ago i sneezed and broke a rib ! ' you might as well get a fracture from doing something exciting			2
' embarrassing bodies is on @entity179 at 9pm tonight			0
