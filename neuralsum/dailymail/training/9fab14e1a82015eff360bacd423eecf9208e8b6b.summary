the jury decided that the majority of @entity5 smartphones and tablets violate patents held by @entity2 including features such as the zoom in and out innovation achieved by tapping the screen			2
the jury also decided that @entity5 's infringement was intentional and said the firm 's counter-suit for $ 399 million against @entity2 was without merit			1

' we will move immediately to file post-verdict motions to overturn this decision in this court and if we are not successful , we will appeal this decision to the @entity49 , ' a statement from @entity5 said			0
the verdict in the complex case came after the nine - member jury began deliberations on wednesday			0
the software giant are set to call for a sales injunction at a hearing next month , demanding @entity5 products are pulled from the @entity60 market			1
the landmark legal case could also affect other territories such as the @entity63 , as @entity2 could call for import bans on its rivals products			1
@entity66 filed its lawsuit in april 2011 and engaged legions of the country 's highest - paid patent lawyers to demand $ 2.5 billion from its top smartphone competitor			2
@entity5 fired back with its own lawsuit seeking $ 399 million			0
but the day belonged to @entity2 as the jury rejected all @entity5 's claim against @entity2			1
the jury did reject some of @entity2 's claims against the two dozen @entity5 devices at issue , declining to award the $ 2.5 billion @entity2 demanded			1
during closing arguments , @entity2 attorney @entity79 claimed @entity5 was having a ' crisis of design ' after the 2007 launch of the @entity30 , and executives with the @entity86 company were determined to illegally cash in on the success of the revolutionary device			2
@entity5 's lawyers countered that it was simply and legally giving consumers what they want : smart phones with big screens			2
they said @entity5 did n't violate any of @entity2 's patents and further alleged innovations claimed by @entity2 were actually created by other companies			1
reporters wait outside the @entity101 and federal building after a jury reached a decision in the @entity2 @entity5 trial on friday a @entity29 court has decided that @entity2 's @entity106 was copied by @entity5 ' @entity33 tablet 10.1 ( right ) and that the @entity86 firm must pay over $ 1 billion in damages @entity2 's legal team plans to formally demand @entity5 pull its most popular cellphones and computer tablets from the @entity60 market			1
they also can ask the judge to triple the damages to $ 3 billion			1
@entity60 district judge @entity116 will decide those issues along with @entity5 's demand she overturn the jury 's verdict in several weeks			1
the outcome of the case is likely to have ripple effects in the smartphone market			0
after seeing @entity5 's legal defeat , other device makers relying on @entity126 may become more reluctant to use the software and risk getting dragged into court			1
' some of these device makers might end up saying , ' we love @entity126 , but we really do n't want to fight with @entity2 anymore , ' said @entity131 , ceo of @entity132 , an investment bank specializing in intellectual property			1
' i do n't know if $ 1 billion is hugely significant to @entity2 or @entity5 , ' @entity131 said			2
' but there is a social cost here			0
as a company , you do n't want to be known as someone who steals from someone else			0
i am sure @entity5 wants to be known as an innovator , especially since a lot of @entity144 companies have become known for copying the designs of innovators			0
' @entity5 conceded that @entity2 makes great products but said it does n't have a monopoly on the design of rectangle phones with rounded corners that it claimed it created			2
the trial came after each side filed a blizzard of legal motions and refused advisories by @entity60 district judge @entity116 to settle the dispute out of court			2
@entity5 has sold 22.7 million smartphones and tablets that @entity2 claimed uses its technology			1
@entity79 said those devices accounted for $ 8.16 billion in sales since june 2010			0
@entity2 and @entity5 combined account for more than half of global smartphone sales			0
as part of its lawsuit , @entity2 also demanded that @entity5 pull its most popular cellphones and computer tablets from the @entity60 market			1
from the beginning , legal experts and @entity175 analysts viewed @entity5 as the underdog in the case			0
@entity2 's headquarters is a mere 10 miles from the courthouse , and jurors were picked from the heart of @entity183 where @entity2 's late founder @entity184 is a revered technological pioneer			0
while the legal and technological issues were complex , patent expert @entity188 @entity189 previously said the case would likely boil down to whether jurors believe @entity5 's products look and feel almost identical to @entity2 's @entity30 and @entity106			1
vengeance : late @entity2 ceo @entity184 holds up an @entity30 : he vowed to fight to the bitter end against those who stole its design @entity2 ceo @entity197 , ( left ) seen with @entity184 in 2010 , took over @entity2 after mr @entity184 ' death in october of 2011 to overcome that challenge at trial , @entity5 's lawyers argued that many of @entity2 's claims of innovation were either obvious concepts or ideas stolen from @entity207 and others			1
experts called that line of argument a high - risk strategy because of @entity2 's reputation as an innovator			2
@entity2 's lawyers argued there is almost no difference between @entity5 products and those of @entity2 , and presented internal @entity5 documents they said showed it copied @entity2 designs			1
@entity5 lawyers insisted that several other companies and inventors had previously developed much of the @entity2 technology at issue			0
@entity5 has emerged as one of @entity2 's biggest rivals and has overtaken as the leading smartphone maker			1
@entity5 's @entity33 line of phones run on @entity126 , a mobile operating system that @entity232 has given out for free to @entity5 and other phone makers			1
@entity232 entered the smartphone market while its then - ceo @entity235 was on @entity2 's board , infuriating @entity2 co-founder @entity184 , who considered @entity126 to be a blatant rip off of the @entity30 's innovations			1
after shoving @entity235 off @entity2 's board , @entity184 vowed that @entity2 would resort to ' thermonuclear war ' to destroy @entity126 and its allies			2
if @entity126 lose any ground in the mobile computing market , that would hurt @entity232 , too			0
that 's because @entity232 relies on @entity126 to drive mobile traffic to its search engine and services to sell more advertising			0
the @entity2 - @entity5 trial came after each side filed a blizzard of legal motions and refused advisories by the judge to settle the dispute out of court			2
deliberations by the jury of seven men and two women began wednesday			0
jurors left the courthouse without addressing the scrum of international media who camped out at the @entity28 courthouse for a month			0
they notified the judge at about 2:30 p.m. that they had arrived at a verdict after deliberating two - and - a - half days			0
many expected deliberations to last longer because of the complexity of the case			0
jurors filed into the courtroom silently friday , the youngest juror who favored flip flops , shorts and playing videogames was wearing a @entity280 sweatshirt and handed over the 20 - page verdict form with little fanfare			0

the @entity60 case is one of some 50 lawsuits among myriad telecommunications companies jockeying for position in the burgeoning $ 219 billion market for smartphones and computer tablets			1
and in what could be a foreshadowing of the @entity60 verdict a court in @entity86 ruled @entity2 and @entity5 have both infringed each other 's patents on mobile devices the @entity316 @entity315 decided @entity5 did not copy the look and feel of the @entity30 , and that @entity2 infringed on @entity5 's wireless technology			1
