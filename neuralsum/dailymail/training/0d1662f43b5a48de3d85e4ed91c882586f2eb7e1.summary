by @entity0 published : 02:42 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 05:38 est , 23 august 2013 prince @entity1 has come under attack again after one of @entity5 's leading architects claimed that he wields a veto over prominent new buildings in @entity8			1
@entity9 , who designed the @entity10 and the @entity11 in @entity12 , described the power held by the @entity1 as ' an amazing situation '			1
the eminent architect 's claims come just a week after it emerged that @entity1 had seconded members of his staff to advise ministers in @entity22 departments			1
veto : prince @entity1 is consulted about major building projects in @entity8 , according to @entity9 , right lord @entity9 told the @entity25 that he had been asked to work on a multi-million - pound development set to be built in @entity8			1
he said he was surprised to have been asked , as he had previously clashed with the prince over his plans for the @entity29 site			0
@entity1 lobbied the emir of @entity31 , who owns the site and eventually agreed to scrap lord @entity9 ' £ 3billion plan for a modernist complex made of glass and steel			1
the 80 - year - old architect went on to tell the magazine that developers routinely consulted the prince before launching major projects			0
' an amazing situation ! ' , he said			0
' but they 're into minimising risk - and prince @entity1 is a risk			0
' scrapped : lord @entity9 ' plan for @entity29 , pictured , was cancelled thanks to the @entity1 landmark : the 80 - year - old architect built the @entity10 in @entity47 , now the @entity48 lord @entity9 - whose work is currently on display in an exhibition at the @entity52 - accused @entity1 of acting in an ' unconstitutional ' manner by consulting the @entity31 in secret , saying that his alleged influence was ' an abuse of power '			1
the developers who were due to carry out lord @entity9 ' plans for @entity29 claimed to have lost more than £ 80million due to the @entity1 's intervention			2
@entity1 first made his traditionalist views on architecture known in 1984 , when he described a proposed new wing of the @entity63 as a ' monstrous carbuncle '			0
he once criticised lord @entity9 ' work in inflammatory terms , saying : ' you have to give this much to the @entity68 - when it knocked down our buildings , it did n't replace them with anything more offensive than rubble			0
' however , @entity76 denied that the @entity1 was asked for his blessing by developers seeking to embark on major projects in @entity8			2
exhibition : lord @entity9 ' ' @entity82 ' installation in the courtyard of the @entity52 in @entity8 ' developers do not seek planning approval from the @entity1 as planning development approvals lie with local planning authorities , ' a spokesman told the @entity89			1
' if developers choose to send the @entity1 information about upcoming developments that is up to them but the @entity1 does not , and can not , grant planning permission			2
' the spokesman added that @entity1 regularly receives letters from ordinary people ' complaining about developments and planning decisions ' due to his well - known interest in architecture			2
developments which were scrapped after the @entity1 publicly opposed them include a planned skyscraper in the @entity104 and a modernist opera house in @entity106			0
however , @entity108 's designs for the @entity109 did come to fruition despite @entity1 's criticisms			0
earlier this week , it emerged that @entity76 aides had been seconded to the @entity113 and the @entity114			0
the revelations prompted claims that the @entity1 could be overstepping his constitutional role by intervening directly in @entity22 decisions .			1

@entity9 expresses surprise at being hired for new @entity8 project
claims the @entity1 is consulted by developments before building
@entity1 is already under *pressure* over private staff working in @entity22
