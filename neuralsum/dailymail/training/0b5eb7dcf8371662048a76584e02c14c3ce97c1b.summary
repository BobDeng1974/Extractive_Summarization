ten of the ninety letters were delivered on tuesday - the date they would originally have been received			1
one letter said : ‘ i wish you a merry @entity2 and all the best for the @entity51			1
‘ but what i hope most is that the war will come to an end soon , so that we can all enjoy life again			2
’ farmer @entity23 , 55 , of @entity57 , received a letter written by soldier @entity59 , a neighbour of his grandfather			2
he said : ‘ i feel it is very important to have the other letters delivered in these cases where family or sons and daughters are still around			1
’ @entity18 of @entity19 said being able to deliver ten of the lost letters was ' beyond our hopes ' another from lance - corporal @entity72 's fiancee @entity71 read : ' @entity2 wo n't be so happy for me this yer , because i 'm only happy when i 'm with you			1

the bag of letters were stolen by a group of teenage boys from a @entity85 post office in @entity86 in 1941 - 18 months after the invasion of the @entity88			1
it was one of a number of small acts of resistance carried out by islanders			2
but even that small act could have resulted in deportation or even death			2
they remained hidden in the piano until 2007 when they were handed to the @entity100 by an anonymous man			1
although the teenagers survived the war they vowed to never speak of the theft again			2
@entity19 spokesman told @entity76 a 16 - year - old friend had been asked to hold onto the letters and still feels ' very strongly ' that it will be wrong to talk about it now			1

he said : ‘ we had to translate the old street names into the 2012 addresses			0
‘ then we found out that not many of the addresses had people living with the same name any more so we used our address expertise , our databases , our military mail experts as well as registry offices			0
’ mr @entity18 said : ‘ when we were first asked to help we thought it would be an impossible task			0
so much time has passed and @entity40 has changed considerably , both geographically and demographically			0
‘ when we started out on this journey we thought it would be fantastic if we could find members of just one of the families involved to find ten is beyond our hopes			2

' at the time of the theft , islanders were beginning to be prosecuted for small acts of resistance and insulting the authorities			2

in @entity166 children of school age were evacuated and most of @entity169 's residents chose to leave			0
in @entity171 islanders were encouraged to stay			0
in @entity6 most islanders stayed , either through choice or because they could not get out			1
shortly before the invasion , 23,000 people queued in @entity86 for days to register for the few boats travelling to the mainland			0
only about 7,000 managed to flee before the @entity40 invasion			0
the @entity88 , including @entity179 , became heavily militarised as @entity180 saw them as a strategic point from which to launch an invasion of @entity184			0
during the occupation , the courts and the government were taken over and a register of the island 's @entity189 was created			0
a curfew was also imposed on the islanders and people aged 14 or over had to carry identification cards			0
radios were confiscated but many had been hidden to allow residents to listen to the @entity198			2
towards the end of the occupation , islanders were faced with starvation when routes to the islands were cut off following the d - day landings			0
