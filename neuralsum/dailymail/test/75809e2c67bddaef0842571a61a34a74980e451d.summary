@entity0 knows @entity2 qualification is @entity3 's to lose , making this weekend 's clash with @entity5 all the more important			1
@entity7 's side sit fourth in the @entity9 standings as the season enters the closing stages , boasting a five - point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at @entity14 before the international break			1
@entity17 's brace earned @entity3 a deserved 2 - 1 triumph at @entity19 to give them a buffer over the @entity21 , as well as fellow top - four contenders @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity3 captain @entity0 feels the club are on course to qualify for the @entity2 @entity3 midfielder @entity17 scored a fantastic brace against @entity14 to secure his side a 2 - 1 win at @entity19 the second of @entity17 's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give @entity3 a 2 - 0 lead in the second - half however , @entity0 is well aware how quickly things can change , admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when @entity5 come to @entity5 on saturday			1
' yes it was ( a six - pointer at @entity14 ) , but that means nothing if we do n't beat @entity5 on saturday , ' the @entity3 captain said			1
' obviously @entity43 play @entity14 as well , so if we can get the win against @entity5 that will be an even better result than @entity14 was for us			2
' i think there are still eight games left			0
we are in a good position at the minute so it 's in our own hands , so have to make sure we do it			0
' @entity0 and several of his @entity3 team - mates only returned home from international duty on wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the @entity58 team plane delayed their departure from @entity60			1
it meant an extra night in @entity62 , where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as @entity65 punished the @entity58 ' poor first - half display			2
however , @entity68 's wonder strike saw @entity58 secure a 1 - 1 draw following a much - improved performance after half - time , when @entity73 's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner @entity0 with full debutant @entity75			1
the @entity58 skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as @entity73 tinkered with his side , although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse			2
' i think it 's important in tournament football you might need that , so that 's what we were doing , ' the 29 - year - old said			0
@entity0 competes for the ball with @entity62 defender @entity92 during tuesday 's international friendly @entity0 runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the @entity95 in @entity60 on tuesday ' we were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football			1
the best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies			0
' you could clearly see in the first half that it did n't work so i think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game			2
' obviously i have n't played in midfield for a few weeks			0
sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time			0
' i had a few chances and could have scored , so i felt i played better when i went up front			0
' @entity3 team - mate @entity120 was another to struggle away from his preferred position , looking lost at times at the base of the diamond			1
he looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after @entity126 complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by @entity127 late in the opening period			0
the 33 - year - old had not played for @entity58 since october 2013 before these matches and @entity0 loves having his club - mate around			1
' i felt @entity127 was the best player on the pitch by a mile , ' he said			0
' he gave us great composure , he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well			0
' asked if @entity127 has been under - rated throughout his career , @entity0 said : ' not from me and certainly not from @entity3 fans			2
' i think he is a fantastic player			0
he has been a big reason why , at @entity3 , we have won so many trophies over the last few years			0
so from myself and his team - mates , he has not been under - estimated			2
' @entity3 and @entity58 midfielder @entity127 has been singled out for his strong performance against @entity62			1
