plea : @entity1 television actress @entity0 has called on @entity2 to save the life of her former lover , @entity4 the last - known girlfriend of @entity6 ’s playboy son @entity4 has called on his ‘ old friend ’ @entity2 to save his life			1

now @entity0 , a 41 - year - old @entity1 model and actress who dated @entity4 for six years after meeting him in @entity24 in 2005 , has called on mr @entity2 to make @entity4 ’s accusers ‘ see reason ’			1
she said : ‘ @entity4 worked closely with mr @entity2 before he was captured			1
' the two are old friends – it is time that mr @entity2 returned some loyalty			1
' mr @entity2 is a man of @entity31 – as a @entity32 he has a moral duty to help a friend in need			1
’ @entity4 ’s close links with mr @entity2 were illustrated in documents found during the uprising			1
a letter written by mr @entity2 in 2007 gave suggestions to help with @entity4 ’s phd , which he was taking at the @entity43			1
miss @entity0 added : ‘ you should just ask mr @entity2 what a serious , honourable person he is			1
the @entity19 has let him down , and so has the international community			0
‘ killing him will achieve absolutely nothing , beyond punishing him for who his father was			0
absolutely everything must be done to save him			0
’ the @entity1 actress said her ‘ discreet relationship ’ with @entity4 - whose name means ‘ @entity57 ’ - began in april 2005 when they were introduced by mutual friends			1
it was strained from the start because she is @entity60 - a fact that caused complications in an @entity64 country such as @entity9			2
her parents - her father is a green energy consultant and her mother a pianist - were also opposed to her converting to @entity64 , she said , and her relationship with @entity4 came in for much criticism in the @entity1 press			2
‘ it was something we had to deal with , ’ said @entity73 , who is now based in her home city of @entity75			0
‘ the fact that @entity4 was prepared to involve himself in a loving relationship with a @entity60 is a measure of how open and civilised he is			0
‘ he judged people for what they are - not what people perceive them to be			0
@entity4 never made an issue of my religion , or the country i came from			0
’ she had previously denied having any contact with @entity4 , after publications including @entity94 ’s @entity93 reported their romance in 2006			0
@entity4 ’s reputation is as a notorious womaniser , and he has been photographed surrounded by gorgeous women			0
on trial : @entity4 , pictured in 2004 ( left ) and 2008 ( right ) is facing the death penalty in @entity9 fall from power : how @entity4 looked after he was captured by revolutionary fighters last november when his father ruled @entity9 , @entity4 played a key role in dealings with the @entity106 , and in particular with mr @entity2 who met the tyrant in the infamous ‘ @entity108 ’ in 2004 to bring @entity9 in from the cold			1
it was around then that a grubby backroom deal is suspected of being done to free the @entity113 bomber , although mr @entity2 denies any part in this			2
when mr @entity2 stepped down as premier , he pursued business interests in the @entity119 country , assisting international companies to make profits from its oil and gas reserves			1
miss @entity0 did not meet mr @entity2 or any of @entity4 ’s other high - profile @entity126 contacts , but says she was dating him during the period when he was meeting them			1
she was also busy with modelling assignments and soap opera parts in mainly @entity1 tv shows at the time			0
at one stage the couple talked of marriage , she said , but were finally separated last year when the @entity9 uprising toppled the dictator after 42 years in power , and @entity4 went on the run			1
the trial of @entity4 , being held in the mountain town of @entity143 , will be one of the biggest events the country has seen			2
previous attempts to bring him to trial had been plagued with arguments over whether the case should be heard in the capital			0

when mr @entity2 stepped down as premier , he pursued business interests in the @entity119 country , assisting international companies to make profits from its oil and gas reserves the @entity143 brigade fighters - who captured him - insisted he be tried in their home town amid fears he might escape with the help of sympathisers if he was put in the dock in @entity153 , or that he would be treated leniently			1
the decision was also complicated by a demand from the @entity19 that @entity4 be tried at the @entity20			0
one official from the @entity9 prosecutor ’s office said recently : ‘ we are sure that the evidence we have gathered is solid and it will shock and surprise the world			0
we believe we are capable of holding a fair trial			0
’ three @entity9 judges will hear the case , which is expected to last for up to six months , with two prosecutors			2
@entity4 has so far refused to appoint a lawyer to defend him , and one will be appointed for him if he continues to refuse			0
human rights groups have argued that the @entity9 justice system is not capable of dealing with such a high - profile case			2
