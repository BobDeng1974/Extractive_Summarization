the extent of the fall - out between @entity1 and the @entity3 hierarchy has started to emerge since the @entity5 2015 chief executive suddenly quit last friday			1
as @entity6 revealed , @entity1 had become so exasperated with the increasing level of interference in her forensic planning of the @entity11 that she felt she could n’t work at @entity12 any longer			2
but it ’s now understood that the @entity3 had become equally fed up with the way @entity1 always demanded her own way — as in her previous role as director of sport at the @entity19 — and did n’t properly accommodate the host nation position at a @entity11 where the financial guarantee stops with them			1
@entity1 resigned as chief executive of @entity5 's @entity11 2015 organising committee last friday and although @entity1 resigned of her own accord , the @entity3 made no attempt to change her mind			1
the crucial relationship between @entity3 chief executive @entity29 and @entity1 had began to unravel over the last few months and culminated in a series of huge rows in @entity29 ’s office at @entity12 last week			1
this led @entity3 chairman @entity34 to tell a member of staff : ‘ we ’ve got a major problem here			0
’ it was @entity29 who was responsible for signing the highly combative @entity1 , whom he knew from his role as ceo of the @entity42 where @entity1 is an influential committee member			2
the exact flashpoint that forced @entity1 to resign less than six months before the start of the tournament is not known			2
but staffing levels at @entity47 are known to concern the @entity3 with nearly 200 already on the @entity49 payroll			0
the relationship between @entity3 chief @entity29 and @entity1 had began to unravel over the last few months sources say @entity29 walked through @entity53 ’s expanded office space recently , wondering what the huge army of employees actually did			1
the 1991 @entity11 , hosted by five unions , had been organised by less than 25 full - time staff — not many more than turned up on the er 2015 team recently to arrange a single fanzone			2
the split with @entity29 also left @entity1 isolated as she made no attempt to embrace the rugby fraternity or commercial agencies like @entity65			2
certainly , the clubs regarded her as very difficult to deal with — unplayable some even said			0
also , @entity29 is not the jovial , happy - go - lucky ceo he portrays on the surface but a ruthless , cold - eyed businessman who has seen off @entity1 in the same ruthless way he brought her in to replace @entity71 @entity29 ’s desire to curb @entity53 excess and bring the organising committee into the bosom of the @entity3 can be seen by the installation of @entity3 finance director @entity77 as the new @entity53 managing director			1
@entity1 had previously held the role of director of sport at the @entity19 the @entity82 have kept their distance from the @entity1 walk - out			0
but they have to take some of the blame for the crazy structure of the @entity11 where they receive an £ 80million guarantee but still keep sponsorship , corporate hospitality and tv rights while leaving the host nation and the organising committee to sell the tickets and fight for recognition			1
@entity1 has made it clear she will not be explaining the personal reasons behind her departure any time soon			0
the @entity82 , headed by @entity98 , have kept their distance from the @entity1 saga it has n’t helped the strained relationship between the @entity102 and the @entity103 over homegrown player numbers that the clubs kept @entity103 chairman @entity106 waiting for one hour and 20 minutes outside their @entity108 meeting last week			1
@entity106 had prepared a presentation but was n’t given the opportunity to address the clubs			0
@entity103 chairman @entity106 was not given the opportunity to address the @entity102 clubs last week @entity113 , @entity114 ’s world - class forward who shuns the trappings of a superstar , has re-organised his representative management in keeping with his low - profile image			1
@entity113 is having his management run by family members — apart from former @entity114 executive @entity121 looking after commercial opportunities			0
@entity114 star @entity113 is having his management run by family members @entity125 ’s signing 18 months ago of new @entity5 star @entity126 — well before his breakthrough for club and country — has increased their stranglehold on the @entity5 squad			0
the swoosh stable also includes @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
@entity125 signed up @entity139 and @entity5 star @entity126 to their brand 18 months ago			0

@entity1 resigned as chief executive of @entity5 's @entity11 2015 organising committee on friday
the crucial relationship between @entity3 chief executive @entity29 and @entity1 had began to unravel over the last few months
the @entity102 clubs kept @entity106 waiting for more than an hour before a *scheduled* meeting last week
