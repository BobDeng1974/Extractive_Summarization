@entity5 , who was looking to become the first @entity6 to reach the fourth round at @entity3 , needed a good start to the second set but played a woeful service game			2
@entity0 , who had called on umpires to tackle time wasting , breezed into a 4 - 0 lead and nothing was going right for his opponent			1
