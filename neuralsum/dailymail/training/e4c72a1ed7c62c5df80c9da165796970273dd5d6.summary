by @entity0 prince @entity1 gave a rare radio interview this morning in a bid to raise the profile of september 's @entity5			1
but in true prince @entity7 style , he could n't resist a cheeky quip , telling dj @entity9 that ' you look like you 've been to a few ' when the veteran host mentioned music festivals			2
the prince , who did the interview alongside former @entity16 @entity15 and @entity17 , went on to reveal that the @entity5 could become an annual event			1
royal radio : @entity1 with marines @entity17 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) in the @entity22 studio all smiles : the three soldiers smile as they chat to dj @entity9 about september 's @entity5 ' this is definitely going to be a regular event , ' he insisted			1
' we ’re still trying to work out whether we do it next year or the year after and whether it ’s going to be within the @entity30 or whether it ’s going to be abroad			2
' but the legacy has already started and if we can use it as a stepping stone for some of these individuals to move onto the @entity36 , great			0
' if some of them want to use it as a one - off to get themselves back on the road and then as a stepping stone to employment , then just as good			2
we will use the @entity5 for as long as it ’s needed			1
' @entity1 , who also told @entity9 that , contrary to rumours , he remains a serving army officer , has been planning the @entity5 for more than a year			1
festivals : @entity1 quipped that @entity9 looked like he 'd been to a few during the radio interview chip off the old block : prince @entity7 and @entity1 , both military men , are famous for their cheeky quips inspired by the @entity54 which sees injured servicemen from the @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 do battle on the sports field , @entity1 said his aim was to make the @entity30 version ' bigger and better ' than the original			1
' the @entity64 have had the @entity54 now for the last four and a half , five years , ' he told @entity9			0
' they have the @entity56 against the @entity66 against the @entity58			0
' we went over there - i had a team of 30 @entity30 guys that joined in with the @entity64 and basically saw this event take place - and decided that it was such a wonderful concept we should steal it , make it bigger , make it better and bring it back home			1
' the resulting games will take place between the 10th and 14th september and will see 400 competitors from 14 countries compete at @entity82 venues in @entity83			1
tickets for the @entity5 go on sale tomorrow and @entity1 said that he hopes to see every seat in the venues , which include the @entity87 , filled up			1
overwhelmed : on his way into the studio , prince @entity1 stopped to have his photo taken with a little girl thrilled : the young fan looked thrilled as kind - hearted @entity1 crouched down for a photo passion project : prince @entity1 was at the studio to promote the @entity5 which open in september ' we ’ve got 55 000 tickets in total , ' said the prince			1
' we ’ve sold a lot and , you know , we want to sell more			2
' my main effort right from the beginning of this whole story was to ensure that we provide the best opportunities and the best atmosphere for these venues , and the @entity87 has , i think , 6,000 seats in it			0
i want every single one filled so come and help fill it			0
' he also the @entity5 rock concert and hinted that there might be more big names to add to a line - up that already includes the @entity118 and the @entity119			1
' the concert , which everyone knows about , is being headlined by the @entity118			2
we ’ve got @entity123 , @entity124 and numerous other people some of which i ’m not allowed to mention			0
' so the concert itself will be fantastic and , as i said earlier , a real chance to come and celebrate and cheer on these guys as they ’re going to be a part of the concert			2
' the @entity5 will also have opening and closing ceremonies - both of which will be attended by @entity1 himself , who added , as he left the studio : ' be there ! ' on the radio : @entity1 with marines @entity17 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) at the @entity140 studio while much of the attention was on prince @entity1 this morning , the marines who accompanied him into the @entity140 studio have fascinating stories of their own			1
@entity16 @entity15 and @entity17 were both injured while serving in @entity143 with @entity144 and hope to take part in the @entity5			1
' i think the @entity5 is going to be incredible for a few reasons , ' says @entity15 , who suffered severe injuries to his arms and legs after an ied exploded nearby			1
' @entity152 woke up in a hospital bed absolutely broken thinking i ’ll never do this again			0
i ’ve got to the point where i realise that i can do a lot of things , but not only do them , but i can compete in them			0
' i just want to keep pushing the boundaries of what i ’m capable of doing , and competition is one way of doing it			0
' fellow marine @entity17 suffered a penetrating brain injury , which left him in a coma for four weeks , a partial right side paralysis and 25 per cent less brain capacity			0
' i do n’t have any regrets , ' he says			0
' i went through a phase in my life when i thought i could n’t go on and live like this			0
' but then i realised it did n’t make me feel any better , so i stopped			0
i want to take part in the @entity5 because the opportunity to represent the @entity30 would be a brilliant feeling			2
' @entity177 , especially cycling , has helped me enormously			0
probably even more psychologically than physically			0
it ’s enabled me to believe in myself again			0
' motivation : prince @entity1 , seen here with a serviceman at @entity183 , hopes to repeat the event important : the @entity5 will also feature soldiers from @entity143 and @entity186 among other nations			1
