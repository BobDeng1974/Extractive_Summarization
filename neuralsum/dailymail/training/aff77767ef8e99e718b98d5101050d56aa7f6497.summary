the @entity1 's two most senior figures came under fire yesterday after claiming the poor are being left behind and whole cities swallowed up in a ' cycle of decline '			1
in a highly political intervention – coinciding with the start of the general election campaign – the @entity10 and @entity11 insisted that the @entity12 was ' casting aside ' the poor while chasing votes in @entity15			1
as a result , they said , @entity16 had become dominated by ' rampant ' individualism , is ' ill at ease with itself ' and was in many places ' trapped in apparently inevitable decline '			1
intervention : the archbishops of @entity25 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) said @entity16 is caught in a ' cycle of decline ' last night @entity28 said he ' profoundly disagreed ' with the two archbishops			1
and angry @entity30 said their comments were simply inaccurate and accused the primates of straying too far into the political arena			1
the controversy drew comparisons with the ' @entity37 ' saga of 30 years ago , when the @entity1 's views on poverty in the cities were dismissed by @entity42 's government as ' @entity43 '			1
the comments were made by the @entity10 and @entity11 in a campaigning book to be published next week			1
the archbishop of @entity25 , the most reverend @entity47 , and his counterpart from @entity11 , the @entity50 dr @entity49 , put their names to a series of essays that quoted the words of @entity55 with approval and attacked politicians for trying to appeal to ' the swing vote of @entity59 '			1
anger : @entity61 said the church should concentrate on dealing with its own problems their book , on rock or @entity67 ? , declared that many are ' left behind ' by ' rampant consumerism ' and individualism			1
one @entity72 source described the bishops ' analysis as ' ridiculous ' , adding : ' it 's so far out there i 'm not sure it merits a response			1
' former @entity72 deputy prime minister @entity80 , who built his reputation in the 1980s on reviving the fortunes of northern cities , called the archbishops ' out of touch '			1
he said on @entity86 's @entity87 that archbishop @entity47 's description of the spiral of decline of cities outside @entity92 was wrong			1
' i have spent some 30 or 40 years dealing with leaders in local authorities , ' he said			2
' and the transformation , and they acknowledge this , is extraordinary			2
' @entity61 said the @entity1 should concentrate on dealing with its own difficulties with falling congregations , lack of money and shortage of priests , before it started telling other people what to do			2
@entity107 , however , sought to play down the row			2
the prime minister 's official spokesman said the @entity1 had made ' important points about the need to do more to support families '			1
however , the spokesman stressed the @entity115 had launched many initiatives to boost growth in @entity59 's cities , particularly in the @entity119			1
and northern business chiefs said they were deeply angered by the views of @entity47			2
@entity122 , chief executive of the @entity123 , said : ' we have been growing faster than any other region , and our exports mean we have a positive balance of payments			2
' critics of @entity47 said that @entity131 figures show that over the past year 65 per cent of all private sector job growth has come from outside the @entity133			2
they added that @entity134 and @entity135 are growing faster than @entity92 and unemployment is falling across the @entity119			2
the book was edited by @entity138 and featured a contribution from the archbishop of @entity25			1
despite assurances that it did not amount to socialism , it was greeted with enthusiasm by @entity146			2
he said : ' @entity28 used to say ' we 're all in this together '			2
today , @entity1 leaders are saying they do n't believe him			2
' they were wrong last time ... this time they 're irrelevant : commentary by @entity153 the quickest way to ruin a dinner party is to talk about the @entity157 belief in an after - life			2
‘ @entity163 ? it ’s just a fantasy cooked up by clergy to keep themselves in a job , ’ a typical metropolitan hostess might say , her lip curling as she spoons out the asparagus soufflé			0
to which i can only reply : in 20 years of covering religious affairs as a journalist , i have almost never heard vicars or priests talk about heaven – except from the narrow confines of the pulpit , and even then not very often			0
echo : one of @entity42 's ministers described similar comments as ' @entity43 ' but i certainly hear clergy talk incessantly about another fantasy world			1
it ’s a @entity16 in which they talk about the ‘ gulf between rich and poor ’			1
this always seems to be a nicely flexible concept that they never precisely define			0
above all , it is always ‘ widening ’ and they argue that society ’s ills can be miraculously solved if only more taxpayers ’ money was spent on them as if it was holy water			0
this week , they are it again with a book that deliberately echoes the infamous ‘ @entity37 ’ report published by the @entity1 in 1985 when @entity42 was prime minister			0
it controversially called for greater government spending in every conceivable area ( except on the country ’s military defences , of course ) and was denounced by one thatcherite minister as ‘ @entity43 ’			1
such criticism was , i believe , over the top – but make no mistake : the truth is that the @entity1 tried to strangle the @entity211 reforms that turned @entity16 into the economic capital of @entity213			1
the @entity1 failed in it efforts – and it seems that @entity49 is still very bitter			0
in his new book , he says he is sorry that the @entity1 lost its nerve in its response to what he calls the ‘ savage attack ’ of @entity222			1
the left - wing bishops did not lose their nerve : they actually did everything in their power to elect @entity228 ’s @entity227 as prime minister			0
and then when that failed , too , they went into a sulk			0
perhaps the most depressing aspect of this offensive by the @entity1 is the involvement of the archbishop of @entity25			1
the fact is that some of what he says is patently not true			0
of course , there are parts of @entity16 that , sadly , struggle with poverty and addiction , but that does not make us ‘ a people in crisis ’			1
we are embarked on a fragile economic recovery , under a government that is attempting to reduce inequality by ambitious and expensive welfare reforms			0
yet , as in 1985 , the @entity1 apparently wants to derail that recovery , by painting a picture of an economic landscape so apocalyptic that voters will take the risk of making @entity146 prime minister and putting @entity258 – @entity259 help us – in charge of the country ’s finances			0
this is surprising given @entity47 ’s background : having worked for an international oil company and having been a supporter of @entity42			0
he is the first primate of @entity268 who can argue with economists in their own language			0
veering : with a background in the oil industry , @entity47 's lurch to the left is somewhat surprising so why has he veered so sharply to the @entity276 ? one reason is that he was appalled by the poverty he encountered for the first time when , having packed in his business career , he trained for the @entity1 ministry in @entity282			1
also , his stepfather , lord @entity283 , is a @entity228 peer			0
even so , no one expected him to be quite so hostile to the government led by his fellow @entity287			1
@entity289 to the current church / state battle is the archbishop of york – a vigorous @entity157 and a brave man who , in his native @entity292 , was jailed for criticising the country ’s blood - drenched leader @entity295			1
but – and i ’m sorry if this sounds rude – he is also an unreconstructed old @entity299 whose interminable anti-colonialist rants had @entity301 members rushing for the door back in the early - 1990s			0
to coincide with his new book , dr @entity49 has given an interview to the @entity307 ’s @entity306			0
she asked him what right the @entity1 has to poke its nose into politics when its congregations are dwindling			0
his response was feeble – blathering on about the number of people who attended the carol service at @entity317			0
he also claimed that the ‘ @entity319 ’ invited him to an event and that they ‘ fill the ballroom in @entity321 with 350 people who want to come and find faith in @entity324			0
’ three hundred and fifty people ? that hardly compares with the thousands who attend @entity330 rallies in the developing world			0
and there is no @entity333 of @entity321			0
the truth is that church congregations have shrunk by a third to just 800,000 a week since @entity37 was published			1
the @entity1 ’s bureaucracy , though , is bigger than ever – and invested with a public - sector mentality that makes its pronouncements hard to distinguish from those of the public service union @entity341			0
ultimately , a key reason for the @entity1 ’s hostility to market forces lies in its own failure to sell itself			0
church attendance has fallen off a cliff – and the same would be true of @entity348 , too , if it were not for the presence here of immigrants			2
embarrassed by this fact , bishops are reduced to pontificating about the ‘ scandal ’ of food banks and issues such as climate change			0
i hate to say this , but perhaps it ’s just as well that , come the election , most of us wo n’t pay the slightest attention to the advice of our @entity157 leaders			0
@entity153 is the author of @entity367 : @entity368			0

archbishops of @entity25 and @entity11 say @entity16 's consumerism is ' rampant '
comments likened to saga which led @entity222 to call church @entity43
@entity80 said remarks ' out of touch ' and *pm* ' profoundly disagreed '
