the only room which was not in this truly horrific condition was @entity28 ’s bedroom			1
but for almost two years that room contained a terrible secret			2
hidden in a travel cot , beneath clothes , shoes and bedding , was the body of @entity47			0

she returned home to find @entity26 dead			1
@entity28 said she held her son for hours before placing him back in his travel cot			2

@entity116 , too , kept the secret			0
burial : @entity28 and her 24 - year - old son @entity130 have been convicted of failing to bury the neglected little boy abusive : social services and police saw @entity28 as an abuse victim			1

as the months passed no one reported @entity26 missing or feared for his safety			2
it was as if this waif - like boy had never existed			0
people in the neighbourhood were oblivious to what was happening inside the house			2
some had never seen @entity26 and did n’t realise some of the children existed			1
malnourished and neglected : this is the babygrow @entity26 was found in after he died aged 24 months living room : the floors were covered in rubbish and mouldy food that the children were forced to crawl through but @entity28 was also so cut off from relatives that her father did n’t know @entity26 had been born			1
