hundreds of patients could suffer impaired vision after receiving eye surgery by a high street optician , experts fear			2
safety concerns have been raised over a type of replacement lens implanted in patients by @entity9 , the @entity11 ’s leading commercial eye surgery provider			1
more than 6,500 @entity11 patients are thought to have received the @entity14 lens , manufactured by @entity16 company @entity15 , which went on sale just over a year ago			1
@entity18 and @entity9 both deny any fault with the lens , which is used in a corrective procedure called refractive lens exchange to fix minor sight problems usually associated with age			1
but leading eye surgeons have contacted the @entity26 after their patients complained of severe loss of vision after receiving the implant			1
@entity31 in @entity32 flagged the problem to the @entity26 after two of its surgeons complained about the lens			2
scientific study : a spokesman for @entity9 said every lens type that its uses has passed a ' rigorous and time - consuming evaluation to make sure that it is both safe and effective ' @entity44 : paid £ 4,200 for eye surgery at 46 , @entity44 needed reading glasses for detailed work and had noticed his long vision was going			1
two minor operations later and he can barely see six inches in front of his face			2
the company director , from @entity53 , went into an @entity9 branch in @entity55 to enquire about £ 700 laser eye surgery so he would no longer need glasses			1
a short while later he had parted with £ 4,200 , having been persuaded he needed to have the lenses in both eyes replaced with high - tech plastic discs			0
‘ they really gave me the hard sell , ’ mr @entity44 said			0
‘ they kept saying i would have “ hd vision ”			0
’ but he claims he can no longer focus on anything more than five inches away , requires bright lights in the house and struggles to see at night			0
a spokesman for @entity9 said : ‘ mr @entity44 is in the very early post-operative phase and with additional management his symptoms will subside and he will be able to fully enjoy his new vision without spectacles for distance or near vision			1
’ @entity76 of law firm @entity77 , who is representing the patients , said he anticipated that he would reach 100 concerned patients very shortly			2
there has been a sales culture at @entity9 where there has , on occasions , been a failure to properly explain the risks of surgery to patients			1
’ private surgeon @entity89 , who runs the @entity90 , called for far better regulation of @entity93 corrective eye clinics			2
mr @entity89 said : ‘ the major problem here is that model of care is “ pile them high , sell them cheap ”			0
you have eye surgery being sold in heavily marketed , time - limited offers			0
these are complicated procedures , but they are being sold like they are tvs or second - hand cars			0
‘ the regulations are there but they are not being enforced			0
’ @entity109 , 61 , who has been campaigning for better regulation of the corrective surgery industry , said : ‘ the only reason anybody should have these operations is if it is the only option that will stop them going blind			0
they are just not safe			0
’ a spokesman for @entity31 said : ‘ two surgeons had used these lenses in a very small number of patients , some of whom developed visual problems and required replacement of the lens			1
‘ @entity31 reported concerns with this particular make of lens via the @entity26 ’s yellow card scheme			1
@entity31 no longer uses this lens			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity26 said : ‘ we are currently investigating and will take action if necessary			0
if patients have any questions they should speak to their optometrist or surgeon			2
’ worries : @entity31 ( pictured ) in @entity32 flagged the problem to the @entity26 after two of its surgeons complained about the lens a spokesman for @entity9 said : ‘ every lens type that we use has passed a rigorous and time - consuming evaluation to make sure that it is both safe and effective			1
commercial eye clinics are regulated by the @entity151 , but experts claim the organisation takes only a general overview			0
@entity89 , a leading eye surgeon , said tonight that the @entity151 should establish far stricter inspections and monitoring			0
he also called for new guidelines limiting refractive lens exchange in commercial corrective sight procedures to people aged over 50			1
' this includes the @entity163 lens , which is being used here in the @entity11 by many providers and around the world			1
‘ it is vitally important to stress that there have been no safety concerns whatsoever expressed about this lens			1
' a tiny minority of patients are reported to have experienced poorer than expected distance vision , but the overwhelming majority have had their sight and their life significantly improved by having this lens implanted			1
’ a spokesman for @entity15 confirmed the firm had received four ‘ incident reports ’ from the @entity26			2
he added : ‘ we are currently in the process of analysing the facts , as all of these reports are very unspecific and unsubstantiated , only basically mentioning poor distance vision as the main complaint			0
‘ the @entity188 is considered to be one of the better balanced intraocular lenses available and is used by many renowned surgeons whose opinions are generally based on medical evidence			0
we believe very strongly in the concept and it is by no means a “ faulty ” model of lens			0
