the report claims that the new @entity16 will include a 12.2 - inch display , new @entity23 processor , four speakers to offer stereo sound in any orientation , and arrive sometime between april and june of next year			2
@entity26 and others reported that @entity2 was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015 , while a recent report from @entity30 claimed @entity2 had postponed mass production of the larger ipad from december 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the @entity35 and 6 @entity1 launch			2
the latest rumors from the supply chain point to delays that will see mass production of the larger @entity16 start sometime in @entity42 or q2 of next year			2
the new larger @entity16 is expected to look like the recently launched @entity44 , with rounded corners , the designs show the gadget is just 7mm thick			1
the new largter @entity16 is expected to look like the recently launched @entity44 ( pictured ) , with rounded corners , the designs show the gadget is just 7mm thick			1
latest rumors for the device claimed @entity50 would sport a smaller 12.2 - inch display and a profile of 7mm , which lines up with the drawings published in the latest @entity11 issue today			0
several reports have pointed to a yet to be announced @entity16 that will reportedly include a display measuring somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 - inches , however reports have claimed various sizes ranging from 12 inches to 12.9 inches			2
it comes just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the @entity35 56 plus was impacting on @entity16 usage			1
the release of @entity2 ’s @entity66 means there is now only a 2.4 - inch difference between the size of the phablet ’s screen , and the display on its ipad mini			0
@entity74 studied more than two million articles and videos opened using its app , and compared the before - and - after behaviour of @entity35 and @entity16 users			1
people with an @entity81 use their phone 55 % of the time , but this increases to 72 % for the @entity35 and 80 % for the @entity85 - both at the detriment of the @entity16 and figures suggest this similarity could cause serious problems for @entity2 ’s tablet range			1
analysis has revealed that as phones become larger , more people use them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant			0
in fact , the research found that people who recently upgraded to an @entity35 6 plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before			1
the research was carried out by @entity74 - an app that lets users save webpages , videos and other content for reading later			0
it analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app , and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an @entity35 5 , @entity111 and @entity81 and those who now own an @entity113			2
it also looked at the use of tablets by the same people			0
‘ the bigger your phone ’s screen , the more time you ’ll spend reading and watching on it , ’ explained the researchers in a blog post			0
‘ in fact , the bigger your phone ’s screen , the more you ’ll read and watch as a whole			0
’ it discovered that users who upgraded to an @entity35 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time , up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen			1
@entity74 also saw users with both an @entity35 and an @entity16 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity136			1
those with the @entity35 ( centre ) opened 33 % more articles and videos inside @entity74 than they did with a @entity81 ( left ) , and those with a @entity141 ( right ) opened 65 % more items than before the @entity35 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through september and into early october , while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent			1
@entity2 's cheaper @entity81 and 5c handsets made up the rest of the sales			0
following last year 's launch , the @entity81 and @entity111 accounted for 84 per cent of total @entity35 sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular			2
the skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the @entity85 are lower because @entity2 is struggling to complete orders			0
recent figures from @entity74 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity74 users are opting for an @entity35 as opposed to a 6 @entity1			1
and @entity85 consume content on their phones 80 per cent of the time - the same ratio of phone to tablet reading as seen on @entity160			0
@entity74 also saw that users with both an @entity35 and an @entity16 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity136			1
those with the @entity35 6 now open 33 per cent more articles and videos inside @entity74 than they did with a 5 or @entity81 , and those with the 6 plus open 65 per cent more items than they did with a smaller phone			1
users with an @entity35 6 now read on their tablets 19 per cent less during the week , and 27 per cent less over the weekend			1
while those with a 6 @entity1 are on their tablets 31 per cent less during the week and 36 per cent less over the weekend			0
‘ that being said , there remains one place where tablets still hold reign : your nightstand , ’ added the researchers			0
‘ regardless of which @entity35 they have , users still reach for their @entity179 around 9pm for some late - night , bedtime reading			2
’ but , a larger screen does make it less portable and @entity74 noticed that people with an @entity85 read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model			0
recent figures from @entity74 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity74 users are opting for an @entity35 as opposed to a 6 @entity1			1
‘ this tells us that , at least for now , convenience and portability trump a better , and bigger , entertainment and reading experience			0
