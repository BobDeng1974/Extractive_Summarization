@entity1 supremo @entity0 has given special dispensation to @entity3 to miss the next two grands prix whilst a buyer is sought for the cash - strapped marque			1
a statement issued by the administrators in @entity11 - based accountancy firm @entity10 has effectively confirmed @entity3 will not be in a position to compete in next weekend 's @entity14 @entity13 and the subsequent race a week later in @entity16			2
administrator @entity17 , who was forced to close the gates to the team 's factory at @entity21 on thursday , has told @entity3 staff not to return until a deal has been concluded			1
@entity3 are in danger of going out of business after a four - year stay on the @entity1 grid @entity28 has been expressed that a buyer of ' substantial financial means ' can quickly be found in order for @entity3 to be back on the grid for the final race of the season in @entity34 on november 21 - 23			1
ordinarily , should a team miss a race for any reason they would be punished by @entity0 , but given the circumstances in this case he has opted to be lenient			1
the statement read : ' in a telephone conversation today between @entity17 and @entity0 , mr @entity0 agreed to support the administrators in their wish to sell the @entity1 team to a party with the financial strength to sustain it into the future			1
' mr @entity0 also agreed to give dispensation to @entity51 such that it could , if necessary , miss the @entity14 and @entity16 @entity52 , but hoped that a new owner would be in a position to race the team at the @entity56			1
@entity1 supremo @entity0 ( left , pictured talking to @entity57 , the @entity58 ) has given @entity3 special dispensation not to field cars in the next two races ' mr @entity62 , the previous principal of the team , offered today to hand over management control of @entity65 to the administrators			1
' lawyers for the administrators and mr @entity62 are currently working on the paperwork to effect this transfer			0
' the administrators have already been contacted by a number of interested parties expressing a wish to buy the team and they hope a transaction with an operator of substantial financial means can be concluded in the next few weeks			2
' it is hoped that any purchaser of the @entity51 team will take over the employees and they will be able to recommence their work including that at the @entity21 site			2
' earlier on friday @entity10 were handed full management responsibility for @entity3			2
@entity3 in action during practice at the @entity13 in @entity89 in october the firm had already been working on behalf of the creditors of @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , a company which makes and supplies cars to @entity65 , the entity which owns the licence to race in @entity1			1
but @entity17 has also now been placed in charge of @entity65 , with his overwhelming priority to find a buyer for the beleaguered marque			0
the @entity10 statement confirmed they had agreed terms to acquire the share capital of @entity65 , affording them the ability to sell the team lock , stock and barrel , rather than simply acting for @entity92			0
any buyer will acquire the @entity1 licence , the cars , designs and intellectual property for current and future seasons , the workforce and all of the technical support provided to the racing team by @entity92 from the @entity116			1
@entity117 , another administrator at @entity10 , said : ' purchasing the assets would give the buyer ready access to f1 racing			0
' @entity122 relinquished control of @entity3 to the consortium at the end of june this year @entity17 , meanwhile , added : ' we believe this arrangement gives us a much better chance of being able to reach a better conclusion for the racing team and its creditors			1
' while this is a great step forward in making the whole team and assets more attractive , there is no need for the staff of @entity65 to return to the @entity139 site in @entity21 until a sale of the @entity1 team occurs			2
' this is a difficult situation which is not of our making			0
we regret any personal impact on @entity146 's employees			0
' as administrators for @entity92 we are seeking to maximise the outcome for its creditors and other stakeholders			0
' @entity17 has firm belief a deal with an interested party can be struck , adding : ' our objective is to get this team racing on a proper financial standing , and hopefully if a funder comes through , this team can run again			0
' i have spoken to people who are interested in taking over the @entity21 factory , and the staff being employed there			0
' it 's early days , but there is a major hope that all of that can happen			0
' the administrator overseeing the crisis had feared @entity171 would not compete at the @entity14 grand prix			0

@entity3 are strapped for cash and are seeking a buyer at present
the team are being given special dispensation by @entity1 *authorities*
