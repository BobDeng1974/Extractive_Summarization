the dead body of a 12 stone porpoise was found dumped in an alleyway - more than a mile from the coast			1
mystery surrounds how the 4ft long mammal got to @entity6 , just outside @entity7 in @entity8 , as they are banned from being kept as pets and rarely in captivity because they have difficulty adapting			1
the animal was found lying in its own blood on saturday evening by passersby and experts believe its appearance in the alleyway was probably the result of a ' strange @entity20 prank			1
' the porpoise is believed to have died after being washed up on the beach and had been dead for around two days			1
a porpoise was found in an alleyway in @entity6 in @entity25 , more than a mile from the shore , on saturday the porpoise , weighing 12 stone , had to be covered with biohazard bags before it could be collected for testing @entity31 , 31 , was told the animal had been found on saturday evening			1
he said : ' it was all so surreal			0
how on earth did a dead dolphin end up in our alley ? ' it looked like it had been dragged , but even so , that would require a lot of effort			1
' we 're all floundering as to who , or what , would do such a thing			0
' the animal is a male harbour porpoise , which usually travel round in small groups and are traditionally hard to spot as they rarely come out of the water			2
from a distance they look similar to dolphins and are often found in the @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			2
@entity6 , in @entity25 , lies around 1.2 miles from the seafront			1
the @entity59 has since received reports from people saying they saw the porpoise washed up on the beach			1
mr @entity31 added : ' nobody has a clue how it got here			0
we were all stood round , all bemused			0
one old lady reckons it was dumped there as part of a revenge attack straight out of the @entity73			2
' i 'm not so sure - unless you live on our estate , you would n't have any reason to even know that that alley exists			2
' there was a little girl who saw it and looked really upset			0
if it was put there as a joke , it was n't a funny joke			0
' it 's not a through path to anywhere but our homes			0
it 's all so strange - if it was a cow , at least it could have got there and died on its own			0
' mr @entity31 rang the @entity59 who sent an inspector round to examine the porpoise			1
they then covered the animal in yellow biohazard bags until it could be picked up on sunday			0
a spokeswoman from the @entity102 programme , which helped remove the animal , said it had probably died after becoming stranded on the shore			1
porpoises are banned from being kept as pets in the @entity107 and there are no known cases of them being kept illegally , as they are very difficult to house and would need huge facilities like dolphins			1
the porpoise was found in @entity6 in @entity25 on saturday night - which is more than 1 mile from the sea the dead porpoise was found dumped in the @entity8 alleyway on saturday by passerby in @entity6 , @entity8 she said : ' it had been dead for a day or two , and we are putting this down to some kind of prank			1
' you have to bear in mind it was a 4ft animal , so probably a couple of people carried it , realised they could n't do anything with it and dumped it			0
the animal had been dead two days and was decomposing badly			1
it was not going to be particularly pleasant and would have been pretty smelly			0
' generally most people would never have picked it up , and someone out there is likely to have some very smelly clothes			0
' the corpse has been taken to the @entity141 , where a post-mortem will be conducted by the @entity144 programme - experts in all large marine animals who are found washed up on our shores			2
a spokesman from the @entity59 said : ' it is at present unclear how the animal died but it is hoped tests will provide answers to this			2
