@entity0 has lifted the lid on the social - media ‘ bullying ’ he has endured which came to a head after his yellow card in the recent defeat against @entity7			1
the @entity9 hooker has become familiar with the demoralising routine : on - field crime and punishment , followed by a mixture of legitimate criticism and excessive abuse			1
this time , he had cause to believe he had been harshly penalised for his actions , but that did n’t stop the @entity19 trolls tearing into him			1
in the aftermath of that @entity22 series match on november 15 , @entity0 exposed some of the hostile comments he was receiving			2
now , having been recalled to the starting xv after being demoted to the bench for the win against @entity29 , the 28 - year - old has spoken out about the online bile he has had to face			1
@entity0 leaves the field at @entity32 after he was sin - binned late on in @entity9 's loss to @entity7 @entity0 was yellow carded for walking on @entity7 number eight @entity36 ( above ) asked about retweeting several messages , he said : ‘ those were the nice ones as well			1
i got sick of it because i get quite a bit of that on a regular basis			2
that week all we had got is stick			2
so i thought i ’d do it to highlight that it ’s going on			2
people should n’t accept it			0
i was n’t upset or drunk , i just thought it was the best way for people to see what they ( trolls ) write			0
hopefully i made some people realise			0
’ @entity0 ’s experience of such a social - media backlash follows recent events which led to one of @entity61 ’s leading olympians becoming a target , and he added : ‘ just because @entity63 is a pretty young lady who you should n’t bully , you should n’t do it to anyone			1
just because i ’m a big , burly rugby player , i have feelings too			0
you ca n’t cyber-bully anyone			0
’ the unsavoury abuse was prompted by @entity0 ’s latest disciplinary episode , but this one was different to some of his more notorious offences			1
the @entity7 were repeatedly pulling down @entity9 ’s lethal driving maul and when the referee took no action while @entity36 lay on the floor trying to illegally disrupt the pack , @entity0 simply walked over him			1
@entity0 ( centre ) has been recalled to the line - up and will pack down with @entity79 ( left ) and @entity80 sin - binned for stamping , @entity0 insists what he did is standard practice at club level			1
‘ it was stupid , yeah , but it was n’t crazy , ’ he said			0
‘ i made a point of tapping him before i did it and told the ref he was in the way and was n’t moving			0
i did n’t go for a knee , i went for a fleshy part ! i knew stamping was illegal so i walked over him			0
‘ in most club games , you would get away with that , but on the big stage it ’s been made pretty clear you ca n’t			0
bloody slow - motion cameras ! it was stupid but it was n’t red mist			2
in a club game you can probably police that yourselves but on the big stage , no. ’			0
