@entity0 will use sir @entity1 as inspiration as he bids to win the @entity4 ’s manager job on a permanent basis			1
the caretaker boss has revealed that @entity1 – who he served under as assistant for five years - told him to seize any chance he ever had to take charge of the @entity10			1
and @entity0 admits he has picked up @entity1 ’s autobiography in the days since he was asked to take care of first - team matters in the wake of @entity16 ’s decision to quit @entity17			1
@entity0 ( right ) believes sir @entity1 will be looking down on him in the @entity4 dugout the pair worked together at @entity20 as @entity1 led the @entity10 into the @entity21 @entity0 says @entity1 is never far from his thoughts ‘ for some reason , i started reading sir @entity1 ’s autobiography , ’ said the 49 - year - old ahead of the visit of @entity25			1
‘ i read about me and @entity29 ( fighting ) at the airport and all that			2
‘ there was a message at the front of the book – “ thanks for a fantastic , successful five years , it should have been a lot longer , cheers , sir @entity1			1
” ‘ when he gave me that book , he said to me , “ you do realise how big this football club is and if ever you get an opportunity , do n’t be scared of it , enjoy it and take it with both hands ”			2
‘ so i am sitting here now and i ’m going to take it with both hands			2
’ @entity0 enjoyed his only caretaker game in charge of his hometown club following @entity1 ’s sacking in 2004			1
the @entity10 won 3 - 0 and @entity1 telephoned @entity0 the night before to wish him luck			1
and he believes his old mentor will again be looking down on him this afternoon			2
‘ i ’m a catholic and i believe he will be looking down on me , i really do , ’ said @entity0 , who will also take charge of saturday ’s @entity58 third - round tie at @entity59			1
‘ that was why i had the inspiration to get the book and started reading it			2
he talked about the time he went to @entity65 , similar to myself because i went there			2
‘ lots of things started coming back into my head			2
he will be there with us			0
he will be in the technical area with us , let me tell you that , because i never stop thinking about him			0
‘ apart from my mum and dad who i lost recently , there are two people i never stop thinking about - he is one of them and @entity77 is the other			0
@entity16 left @entity4 earlier this week and will take over at @entity78 ‘ they are always with us , and i think about them every game			1
they were good football people			0
and both of those figures understood what it meant to play and manage at this football club			0
’ @entity0 could well be handed the role on a full - time basis until the end of the season at least should he impress over the coming week			1
and the former academy head concedes it would be impossible to refuse such an offer			0
‘ of course it is ( my dream job ) , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m a local lad and it ’s a dream job for anybody			0
‘ when i first had the conversation with @entity16 before i came here , he said to me , “ do you have aspirations to be a manager again ? ”			1
@entity0 says landing the @entity4 job would be a ' dream ' for any local @entity109 lad ‘ i explained that i had done it in @entity65 with @entity111 and i enjoyed it , i loved it , but the fact that you ’re bringing me back to my football club means i 'm quite happy to be an assistant			1
‘ in your head , though , you always want to do it			0
if you asked 100 assistant managers , i think 99.9 per cent would say they would want to do and they would be lying if they did n’t			0
‘ but that ’s not something for now , for me			0
now is preparing the team for @entity25 and trying to get the right result for the club			0
‘ let ’s get two wins and then we ’ll address it after that			0
