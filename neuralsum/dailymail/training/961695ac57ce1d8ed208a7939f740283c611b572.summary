by @entity0 it is a problem every smartphone and tablet owner has had - once the sun comes out , seeing your gadget 's display becomes virtually impossible			0
now researchers may have an answer - in the shape of a tiny set of teeth			0
the ' nanoteeth ' etched into the glass are able to make it anti glare and anti reflective			1
the new glass surface that reduces both glare and reflection , which continue to plague even the best mobile displays today			1
on a very fine scale , they roughened a glass surface so it could scatter light and ward off glare but without hurting the glass ’s transparency			1
then the researchers etched nano - size teeth into the surface to make it anti-reflective			1
in addition to achieving both of these visual traits , the researchers showed the textured surface repelled water , mimicking a lotus leaf			0
@entity37 researchers at the @entity38 of @entity39 working with @entity41 ’s team at @entity42 set out to find a new method			1
users still typically have to buy a filter or film - some of questionable effectiveness - to lay on top of their glass screens so they can use the devices in bright light , or rely on a mono screen such as those in @entity55 's @entity54			2
the team said teeth were the key			0

the new coating could improve your selfies by letting you see clearly on the beach in addition to achieving both of these visual traits , the researchers showed the textured surface repelled water , mimicking a lotus leaf			0
' although the anti-glare roughening protects the nano - size glass teeth , further research is needed to ensure that the surface can withstand heavy touchscreen use ' , they say			2
they add that the method is inexpensive and can easily be scaled up for industry use .			0

developed by @entity42 , who make the glass used in @entity89
could allow tablets and *tvs* with no glare
