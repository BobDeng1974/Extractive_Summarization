@entity1 largest budget airline has just been granted approval to develop a transatlantic service between @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity6 , the @entity8 - based budget carrier , plans to run services between key @entity4 cities and the @entity5 with one - way tickets costing from as little as $ 15			1
the idea is part of an aggressive growth strategy , connecting airports such as @entity13 and @entity14 with @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity6 , @entity4 's largest budget airline , has received board approval to develop a transatlantic service for budget passengers , with one - way tickets between the @entity5 and key @entity4 cities costing as little as $ 15 the airline first mooted the idea of offering transatlantic flights back in 2008 and board approval comes after the airline has invested 18 months in cleaning up its image and improving customer service			1
it is believed it could take up to five years to realize the plan , as the airline needs to source appropriate long - haul aircraft for the routes			2
last year , @entity39 , the airline ’s chief executive , told the @entity42 conference in @entity43 that @entity6 would offer the $ 15 flights to @entity16 and @entity15			1
however , he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage			0
he said : ' we can make money on 99 cent fares in @entity4			0
@entity52 previously said the airline has long been looking at long - haul flight plans , but is held back by a lack of aircraft availability ' not every seat will be ( $ 15 ) of course ; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats			0
' in a separate conversation , mr @entity52 admitted : ' we 've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic , low - fares airline			0
' the difficulty is , i keep cautioning , is that there 's no availability of long - haul aircraft for another four or five years			0
' sir @entity73 revolutionised air travel with his idea for budget flights between @entity4 and the @entity5 , but his airline failed in 1982 @entity78 is n't the only airline to consider offering budget transatlantic flights			1
previously , sir @entity73 launched @entity81 in the late seventies to offer ' no frills ' flights to the @entity5 , but his carrier @entity85 failed in 1982			2
@entity86 tried a similar concept in 2002 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2008			0
more recently , @entity89 has launched its own budget flights between @entity91 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity92 from as little as £ 389 ( $ 415 ) return .			2

@entity6 is @entity4 's largest budget airline carrier
