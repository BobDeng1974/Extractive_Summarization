the @entity1 's crust under @entity2 is rising			1
a new study has found that as global warming melts the island 's great ice caps , the crust is ' rebounding ' and rising			1
some sites in south - central @entity2 are moving upward as much as 1.4 inches per year , the researchers concluded			2
some sites in south - central @entity2 are moving upward as much as 1.4 inches per year — a speed that surprised the researchers			2
geologists have long known that as glaciers melt and become lighter , the @entity1 rebounds as the weight of the ice decreases			1
whether the current rebound geologists detect is related to past deglaciation or modern ice loss has been an open question until now			2
some sites in south - central @entity2 are moving upward as much as 1.4 inches per year — a speed that surprised the researchers			2
the @entity24 - led team reports in an upcoming issue of @entity26			0
the paper is the first to show the current fast uplift of the @entity2 crust is a result of accelerated melting of the island 's glaciers and coincides with the onset of warming that began about 30 years ago , the scientists said			1
some sites in south - central @entity2 are moving upward as much as 1.4 inches per year — a speed that surprised the researchers			2
' our research makes the connection between recent accelerated uplift and the accelerated melting of the @entity2 ice caps , ' said first author @entity46			2
geologists have long known that as glaciers melt and become lighter , the @entity1 rebounds as the weight of the ice decreases			1
whether the current rebound geologists detect is related to past deglaciation or modern ice loss has been an open question until now , said co-author @entity54 , a @entity24 associate professor of geosciences			2
' @entity2 is the first place we can say accelerated uplift means accelerated ice mass loss , ' @entity54 said			2
to figure out how fast the crust was moving upward , the team used a network of 62 global positioning satellite receivers fastened to rocks throughout @entity2			1
by tracking the position of the gps receivers year after year , the scientists ' watch ' the rocks move and can calculate how far they have traveled — a technique called geodesy			0
the new work shows that , at least for @entity2 , the land 's current accelerating uplift is directly related to the thinning of glaciers and to global warming			1
' what we 're observing is a climatically induced change in the @entity1 's surface , ' @entity54 said			1
he added there is geological evidence that during the past deglaciation roughly 12,000 years ago , volcanic activity in some regions of @entity2 increased thirtyfold			1
others have estimated the @entity2 crust 's rebound from warming - induced ice loss could increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions such as the 2010 eruption of @entity93 , which had negative economic consequences worldwide			1
@entity2 's glaciers ( white ) are melting faster and faster			0
as a result , the @entity2 crust near the glaciers is rebounding at an accelerated rate , in some cases , as much as 1.4 inches per year , a @entity24 - led team of geoscientists found			1
the researchers used @entity2 's geodesy network of sensitive gps receivers ( red triangles ) to determine how fast the land is rising			1
the article ' climate driven vertical acceleration of @entity2 crust measured by @entity113 ' by @entity114 , @entity54 and their co-author @entity117 of @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 , was accepted for publication jan. 14 , 2015 , and is soon to be published online			0
the @entity122 and the @entity123 funded the research			0
the team primarily used the geodesy network to track geological activity such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions			1
in 2013 , @entity54 noticed one of long - running stations in the centre of the country was showing that site was rebounding at an accelerated rate			0
he wondered about it , so he and his colleagues checked the nearby stations to see if they had recorded the same changes			0
this global positioning satellite receiver is part of @entity2 's network of 62 receivers to figure out how fast the crust was moving upward , the team used a network of 62 global positioning satellite receivers fastened to rocks throughout @entity2			1
by tracking the position of the gps receivers year after year , the scientists ' watch ' the rocks move and can calculate how far they have traveled — a technique called geodesy			0
some of @entity2 's gps receivers have been in place since 1995			0
@entity54 , @entity117 and colleagues had installed 20 gps receivers in @entity2 in 2006 and 2009 , thus boosting the coverage of the nation 's geodesy network			0
in central and southern @entity2 , where five of the largest ice caps are located , the receivers are 18 miles or less apart on average			0
' the striking answer was , yes , they all do , ' he said			0
' we wondered what in the world could be causing this ? ' the team began systematically analyzing years of signals from the entire network and found the fastest uplift was the region between several large ice caps			1
the rate of uplift slowed the farther the receiver was from the ice cap region			0
other researchers had been measuring ice loss and observed a notable uptick in the rate of melting since 1995			0
temperature records for @entity2 , some of which go back to the 1800s , show temperatures increasing since 1980			0
to determine whether the same rate of ice loss year after year could cause such an acceleration in uplift , @entity114 tested that idea using mathematical models			0
the answer was no : the glaciers had to be melting faster and faster every year to be causing more and more uplift			0
@entity114 found the onset of rising temperatures and the loss of ice corresponded tightly with her estimates of when uplift began			1
' i was surprised how well everything lined up , ' she said			0
@entity54 said , ' there 's no way to explain that accelerated uplift unless the glacier is disappearing at an accelerated rate			1
' estimating ice loss is laborious and difficult , he said			0
' our hope is we can use current gps measurements of uplift to more easily quantify ice loss			1
' the team 's next step is to analyze the uplift data to reveal the seasonal variation as the ice caps grow during the winter snow season and melt during the summer .			2

researchers say the @entity1 's crust is ' rebounding ' and rising
current fast uplift coincides with onset of warming that began 30 years ago
fears changes could increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions
