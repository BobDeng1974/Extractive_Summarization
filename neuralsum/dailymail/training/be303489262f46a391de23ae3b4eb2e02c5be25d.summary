@entity0 campaigner : @entity2 @entity3 has turned down a £ 1million offer from @entity5 1 boss @entity2 to fund a campaign linking @entity7 to the phone hacking scandal			1
the multi-millionaire , who won damages from the now - defunct @entity11 over claims he organised a @entity14 - themed orgy , is now a privacy campaigner			0
he hoped to bankroll an attack on the prime minister by highlighting his ties with @entity19 – who was editor of the sunday tabloid and later hired as the @entity23 leader ’s spin doctor			1
his ‘ @entity25 ’ election drive was to focus on marginal constituencies with the aim of swinging winnable seats to @entity3			1
using formal donation channels , it is claimed the ‘ substantial ’ offer to @entity3 was made a year ago			2
but mr @entity2 , 74 , told a newspaper yesterday : ‘ i have not heard back from them			0
’ it is not clear if there were any serious discussions by @entity3 over whether to take the sum , which would have given a huge boost to its coffers during a general election campaign			2
yesterday a party source confirmed it had been rejected , saying : ‘ we do n’t take money with strings attached ’			1
@entity19 , who became mr @entity7 ’s pr chief in 2007 and was brought into @entity47 as director of communications in 2010 , has just been released from prison after serving five months for conspiring to hack phone messages			1
although mr @entity7 insists he took ‘ full responsibility ’ for hiring @entity19 , @entity3 leader @entity51 has accused the prime minister of bringing a criminal ‘ into the heart of @entity55 ’			1
echoing the comments yesterday , mr @entity2 told @entity57 : ‘ i feel strongly that @entity7 should no longer remain in office as prime minister			2
he took a criminal into @entity55			0
’ mr @entity2 was president of the @entity61 – the international governing body for @entity63 and other motor sports – when the @entity11 published videos and photos of him taking part in a sado - masochistic orgy in 2008 in which @entity69 was spoken and uniforms were worn			0
he successfully sued for breach of privacy and won £ 60,000 in damages after the judge ruled there was no evidence to justify calling it a @entity14 orgy			0
@entity19 ( right ) who became mr @entity7 ’s pr chief in 2007 and was brought into @entity47 as director of communications in 2010 , has just been released from prison after serving five months for conspiring to hack phone messages mr @entity2 has since campaigned to change @entity82 and @entity83 privacy laws and privately underwrote some of the legal cases brought by victims of phone hacking			1
he has argued in the @entity88 that ‘ prior notification ’ should be given to the subjects of newspaper reports to allow them to organise injunctions			0
some of the sunday tabloid ’s photographs are still online , and last year mr @entity2 won a case in @entity96 to stop @entity97 providing links to stories about his sexual past			0
@entity3 last night said it does not comment on individual @entity102 , the offer comes at a time when @entity3 is struggling to match @entity23 election funding , with insiders estimating the party has raised less than half of what may be needed to fund a strong campaign			1
mr @entity2 said he understood his offer might be viewed with some concern following the row over a £ 1million donation by @entity63 supremo @entity114 to labour in 2007			0
it was later linked to the @entity118 government ’s announcement that grand prix races would be exempt from a tobacco advertising ban			0
@entity19 faces a further trial in @entity122 next year on perjury charges related to his 2010 account of phone hacking during the trial of former msp @entity127 .			2

@entity130 hoped to bankroll attack by highlighting ties with @entity19
@entity3 source said party rejected cash as it had ' strings attached '
@entity19 , @entity7 ’s former pr chief has just been released from prison
