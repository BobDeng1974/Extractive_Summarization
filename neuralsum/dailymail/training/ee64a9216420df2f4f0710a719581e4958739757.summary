by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 has been selected for the 5,000m and 10,000m at the @entity2 in august , even though his participation at this month ’s @entity4 remains in doubt			2
but @entity7 performance director @entity6 , who is also @entity8 ’s physiotherapist , said he was ‘ incredibly optimistic ’ the 31 - year - old would compete in @entity10 and did not rule out him doubling up at the @entity11 , too			1
@entity8 has said he will make a decision ‘ further down the line ’ about the @entity14 as he is yet to resume full training following a two - day stay in hospital with abdominal pains earlier this @entity19 said : ‘ that ’s the plan ( for @entity1 to go to the @entity14 )			1
there ’s no reason at this stage to think otherwise			2
included in the squad : but @entity1 is still a doubt for the @entity2 this summer top form : @entity8 will be hoping to secure another gold should he recover for the 5,000 and 10,000m ‘ obviously it ’s impossible for him at this stage to be 100 per cent to do everything in his plans , but i know @entity1 really well and if there was anything he was absolutely certain he was n’t going to be able to do he would have told us up front			1
’ @entity36 has been selected to run the 100m in @entity38 , meaning @entity39 , the only @entity40 man to break 10 seconds this season , must make do with a relay spot			1
@entity36 , 26 , has convinced the selectors of his fitness after running 10.03sec in each of his two races in 2014 , so 20 - year - old @entity39 will only compete in the 4x100m despite clocking 9.96sec last month			2
both sprinters have been overlooked for the @entity14 , meaning @entity39 will not run in an individual event at a major championships in his breakthrough year			0
@entity50 for gold : @entity52 has been handed the third and final 100m spot for the @entity2 relay spot : despite running 9.96secs this season , @entity39 must settle for a 4x100m place @entity57 and @entity58 were already assured of the other two 100m spots in @entity38 after finishing first and second at the @entity61 ’s @entity60 , while @entity62 has opted to contest the 200m along with @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity6 said : ‘ it was a fairly straightforward decision and @entity36 was very deserving of the third spot			0
‘ @entity68 ’s an incredibly talented young guy and he was very understanding of the circumstances			1
‘ i do n’t know if @entity36 is the favourite ( for gold ) , but i bet there are a few people worried about him			0
’ @entity76 was a surprise inclusion for the individual 400m after stating she wanted an easier season before attempting to defend her world title in 2015 , while former world champion @entity81 ’s was selected in the 400m hurdles			0
both athletes ’ participation , however , is subject to them achieving the ‘ a ’ qualifying standard by august 3			0
@entity86 , 19 , was picked for the 400m after running 44.97sec on saturday and will enter his first senior major championships as the fastest athlete in the field this season			0
only @entity91 has run quicker in @entity11 in 2014 but the @entity93 athlete is set to miss next month ’s event with a hamstring injury .			0

@entity8 has been in hospital with abdominal pains , but still in squad
will be looking to complete another double should he be fit
physiotherapist incredibly optimistic he will make it
@entity106 will race in 100m , as well as @entity57
