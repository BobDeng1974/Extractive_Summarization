by @entity0 lottery winners @entity1 and @entity3 have bankrolled an astonishing 80 per cent of @entity5 ’s fight to break up @entity6 , donating £ 2.5million to the cause in just 12 months			1
the full extent of the @entity10 ’ financial backing was laid bare yesterday when @entity5 finally released documents detailing the major donors for 2013/14 as the referendum date nears looms into sight			2
it shows that the @entity17 couple , who won £ 161m in a @entity18 draw in 2011 , has donated a total of £ 4.5m to @entity20 and the @entity5 campaign since their win - £ 1.5m more than had previously been estimated			1
euromillions winners @entity1 and @entity3 who received £ 161million in 2011 from the lottery draw it means almost 80 per cent of £ 4.9million funding for the separation campaign has come from just one source – something the grassroots campaign @entity31 warned was ‘ unhealthy ’			1
critics said yesterday that the balance of funding was ‘ unhealthy ’ - and opponents better together claimed the figures made a mockery of @entity5 ’s claims of diverse grass - roots support			2
@entity39 , director of @entity31 , which campaigns for open and transparent politics , said : ‘ i do n’t think that ’s healthy			0
‘ whether it is one large donor funding a political party , or one side of a referendum , i do n’t think that ’s a healthy situation to be in			0
‘ it should not be determined by one person ’s resources – you are giving one side a stronger voice than the other			0
’ the official referendum period , with stricter spending rules , does not start until may 30 – despite the fact that both sides have been campaigning hard for well over a year			0
‘ it ’s absolutely right that after the @entity63 referendum there should be a review of spending rules , ’ mrs @entity39 said			0
the @entity10 ’ latest £ 2.5million pledge to @entity5 is their second to the pro-independence campaign , having previously donated £ 1million			1
and the couple , who scooped @entity63 ’s biggest ever lottery jackpot , also gave £ 1million to the @entity20 , in 2011			1
the couple have donated a total of £ 4.5m to @entity20 and the @entity5 campaign since their win - which is £ 1.5m more than had previously been estimated in the new figures , @entity5 have also identified their other leading donors – although their contributions are dwarfed by the @entity10 ’			1
@entity75 , from @entity76 , a lifelong @entity77 and failed @entity20 council candidate , donated £ 60,000			1
a further £ 50,000 came from @entity79 who , as well as being head of @entity82 property group , is operations director at @entity5			1
a respected businessman with a ‘ no nonsense ’ style , he was brought in by @entity5 a year ago to shore up the faltering campaign			1
property developer @entity87 , who is on the @entity5 advisory board and has previously donated to the @entity20 , gave £ 50,000			1
the other named donors are @entity90 , who gave £ 10,000 , and novelist and poet @entity92 , who contributed £ 8000			2
yes @entity5 said a further 11,000 people gave donations of less than £ 7,500 , which in total came to £ 473,000			1
but @entity96 said the dominance of the @entity10 in the @entity5 balance sheets shows the campaign does not have the widespread support it claims			1
it means almost 80 per cent of £ 4.9million funding for the separation campaign , headed by @entity105 centre , has come from just one source the pro-independence campaign has received almost double the £ 2.8million @entity96 reported in december			1
however , if you take away the @entity10 ’ contribution , @entity96 would have received more than £ 1million more			2
@entity110 , director of the @entity112 campaign , said : ‘ no - one would criticise the @entity10 , who are long standing @entity20 supporters			1
‘ it is extraordinary that compared to the tens of thousands of small donations received by @entity96 from our supporters , almost 80 per cent of @entity5 ’s money comes from one source			1
‘ we now know why they have been hiding their donations for so long			0
‘ @entity123 relies on the support of a broad mixture of large donors and thousands of ordinary people giving what they can , it is clear that the nationalists are almost completely dependent on one source of income			0
the latest polls suggest one in three @entity63 support @entity105 's bid for separation ‘ with a new poll showing just one third of @entity63 support leaving the @entity6 , these donor details confirm that @entity5 is little more than a front for @entity105 ’s @entity20			1
’ meanwhile , the @entity139 has failed to reveal where it found the money for the £ 1.25million @entity142			0
publishing and distributing the 649 - page manifesto was funded out of taxpayers ’ money - despite being full of @entity20 promises			2
the @entity63 conservatives – who branded it the ‘ biggest ever taxpayer - funded work of fiction ’ – have twice asked which government department had to foot the bill			0
however , @entity155 , the deputy first minister who is also in charge of the referendum , has been unable to answer , giving another holding answer			0
@entity159 , @entity63 conservative finance spokesman , said : ‘ the @entity139 has now decided to give a holding answer to a holding answer , which is something of a new phenomenon			0
‘ i asked a very straightforward question two months ago about what budget the @entity142 expenditure came from , because from reading the @entity139 budget , it is not at all clear			0
‘ either the @entity20 does n’t know where the money came from or it ’s simply unwilling to say			2
‘ neither of those scenarios is acceptable , and the full costs and how they were paid for must be published as a matter of urgency			0
’ a @entity139 spokeswoman said : ‘ the @entity139 will respond to mr @entity177 ’s parliamentary question in due course			0
ministers have been open and transparent regarding the costs involved			0
’ the @entity139 will go into purdah on august 21 – meaning no new policies will be announced until after the referendum – but stricter rules come into force for the parties and campaigners this month			0
the regulated period will run for 16 weeks from may 30 and @entity5 and @entity96 will be restricted to spending £ 1.5million each			2
the @entity20 will be allowed to spend £ 1.344million , @entity188 £ 834,000 , the @entity189 £ 396,000 , the @entity190 £ 201,000 , and the @entity191 – who support independence - £ 150,000			2
@entity194 , chief executive of @entity5 , said : ‘ we greatly appreciate and are hugely encouraged by the thousands of people across @entity63 who have made donations – both large and small – according to their financial means			2
mr and mrs @entity200 declined to comment .			0
