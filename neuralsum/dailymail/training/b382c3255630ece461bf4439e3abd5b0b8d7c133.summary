squalor : a couple have been banned from keeping pets after @entity4 officers discovered they were living with almost 100 cats and dogs dozens of sheep , cattle , and pigs owned by the couple were in such poor condition they had to be destroyed			1
but it was conditions inside the couple ’s home that most shocked vets and the team of @entity4 inspectors who were called in to investigate			1
they found that the farmhouse had been transformed into a foul - smelling kennel for dozens of dogs , with the walls , floors and furniture covered in dog excrement			1
living as an indoor ' feral pack , ' the dogs - a mixture of collies and terriers - were left to fight over food , and 21 were in such poor condition that the @entity4 had to destroy them on welfare grounds			1
of the cats found in the house , two were already dead and a further 16 also had to be put to sleep			1
the discovery of so many animals in the house and pigs , cattle , and sheep in dreadful conditions triggered a huge joint investigation by @entity66 and the @entity4 , which drafted in 10 inspectors from across the north west			1
describing the house , prosecution barrister @entity69 told district judge @entity71 : ' the conditions could only be described as appalling , and fit for neither man nor beast			0
' at @entity76 , the couple entered guilty pleas to animal welfare charges but the court accepted their crimes were the result of neglect , rather than a desire to cause suffering			0
they were given suspended 160 day jail sentences , banned from keeping any animals for life , and told to pay legal costs totalling £ 12,000 each			2

he said : ' the police had visited the farm on an unrelated investigation			0
nothing could have prepared us for what we found inside this farmhouse			2
' it was one of the worst scenes i have come across in my 27 years with the @entity4			2
it was n’t just the deprivation ; it was the sheer number of domestic animals in there			2
' there were 91 in total			0
as well as the 20 cats and 73 dogs , we found a duck , a cockerel , and a cockatiel			1
' the conditions inside the house were appalling : filthy and in a state of disrepair			0
' the dogs - which included five puppies - were living in groups in various rooms			2
only one of the rooms in the house , said mr @entity106 , was fit for human habitation			0
this cat was among the 100 found living in the @entity11 farmhouse the discovery of so many animals in the house triggered a huge joint investigation by @entity66 and the @entity4 the couple admitted six animal welfare offences relating to their 35 sheep , 36 pigs , and 45 cattle , all of which had to be destroyed the weaker of the dogs were unable to compete for the food and water the couple were putting out			1
the couple were unaware two of their cats were lying dead in one room			2
four dogs were found locked in a dark barn , its floor covered in what mr @entity106 described as a sludge of faeces and mud			1
one of the dogs had learned to clamber up a fence so that it could drink water from a lopsided gutter			2
most of the cats were being kept in what @entity4 officials said were shocking conditions in a makeshift pen , its floor soaking wet			1
in court , the couple ’s barrister @entity186 explained that they had got into the habit of taking in stray dogs , some of which bred with others already in the house			2
@entity195 suffered a disability and was unable to help her husband on the farm and because he worked elsewhere milking cows , had less time to care for the animals			0
judge @entity71 described the couple ¿ s offences as ' truly shocking ' @entity204 , trading standards service manager with @entity206 , said : ' this has been a distressing case for all involved			0
' mr @entity186 conceded there were far too many animals for the couple to care for			0
mr @entity106 said he accepted that the @entity212 had not intentionally set out to cause suffering to their animals			0
he added : ' the whole situation was very sad in pure human terms			0
the house was generally filthy , and in my view not fit for habitation , for either this couple or their animals			0
' they should have asked for help			0
hopefully now they will get the help they need			0
' the couple pleaded guilty to 10 charges brought by the @entity4 - two of causing unnecessary suffering , and the remainder of failing to provide adequately for the needs of their animals			1
they also admitted six animal welfare offences relating to their 35 sheep , 36 pigs , and 45 cattle , all of which had to be destroyed			1
judge @entity71 described the couple ’s offences as ' truly shocking , ' saying : ' i ’m of the view it was due to you closing your eyes to the obvious and you chose to ignore it but it was not deliberate			0
' i do n’t think it safe for you to care for animals in the future			0
' @entity204 , trading standards service manager with @entity206 , said : ' this has been a distressing case for all involved , not least @entity19 and @entity256 who were struggling to look after both themselves and their animals during the bitterly cold winter of 2011/12			1
' it gives us no pleasure to see anyone lose the privilege to keep livestock or pets			0
' but the severity of this sentence reinforces the clear duty on all owners to ensure the welfare of animals			0
