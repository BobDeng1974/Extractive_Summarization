by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 17:52 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 17:56 est , 4 february 2013 supersonic skydiver @entity3 fell faster than he or anyone else thought when he jumped from the edge of space in october			1
the @entity8 parachutist known as ' @entity3 ' reached 843.6 mph , according to the official numbers released monday			1
that 's equivalent to @entity11 , or 1.25 times the speed of sound			0
his top speed initially was estimated last october at 834 mph , or @entity15			0
either way , he became the first human to break the sound barrier with only his body			1
he wore a pressurized suit and jumped 24 miles up from a capsule hoisted by a giant helium balloon over @entity23			0
@entity8 @entity3 , 24 miles above @entity25 , jumps out of his capsule and starts his descent through the heavens			1
he fastest speed was 844 mph , 10 mph quicker than first thought @entity3 was supersonic for a half - minute - ' quite remarkable , ' according to @entity31 , the official record - keeping official who was present for the october 14 feat. his heart rate remained below 185 beats a minute , and his breathing was fairly steady			1
the leap was from an altitude of 127,852 feet			0
that 's 248 feet lower than original estimates			1
' he jumped from a little bit lower , but he actually went a little bit faster , which was pretty exciting , ' said @entity43 , technical project director for the @entity45 - sponsored project			2
' it 's fun for us to see reaching @entity11 speeds and proving out a lot of the safety systems , ' @entity43 said in a phone interview from his aerospace company in @entity53 , @entity54 @entity43 said everything pretty much unfolded as anticipated , with no surprises in the final report			0
the updated records were provided by @entity31 , official observer for the @entity60 's contest and records board			0
@entity31 was in @entity62 , @entity23 , for @entity3 's grand finale jump			2
in the foreword of the 71 - page report , @entity3 said he never imagined how many people would share in his dream to make a supersonic free fall from so high			2
some 52 million people watched @entity71 's live stream of the exploit			0
' @entity72 celebrates his successful landing			0
his death - defying jump yielded a wealth of information about the punishing effects of extreme speed and altitude on the human body the scientific and engineering experts who helped bring him back alive ' broke boundaries in their own fields just as surely as i broke the sound barrier , ' @entity3 wrote			1
@entity3 shattered the previous record for a free fall plunge , made by @entity88 , an @entity89 officer , in 1960			2
@entity88 did not quite reach supersonic speed during his jump from 19.5 miles up			0
with @entity3 safely landed , researchers were exhilarated over the possibility his exploits could someday help save the lives of space travelers in a disaster			1
@entity3 's death - defying jump yielded a wealth of information about the punishing effects of extreme speed and altitude on the human body - insights that could inform the development of improved spacesuits , new training procedures and emergency medical treatment			1
a @entity109 engineer who specializes in astronaut escape systems said @entity3 's mission ' gives us a good foundation ' for improving the odds of survival for professional astronauts , space tourists and high - altitude pilots and passengers			1
dr @entity120 , a former @entity109 flight surgeon who lost his wife in the space shuttle @entity123 accident believes the data from @entity3 's jump can be used to improve astronaut safety ' what i would hope is that , perhaps , this is just the first step of many , many advancements to come ' in emergency bailouts , said @entity133 , who heads @entity109 's crew survival engineering office at the @entity135 in @entity136			1
in an interview after @entity3 became the first skydiver to break the speed of sound , @entity133 noted that researchers have spent decades working on self - contained space escape systems , with few significant advances			1
@entity3 's feat was sponsored by energy drink maker @entity45 , and @entity109 had no role			2
dr @entity120 places a rose on his mother 's casket with his son @entity149			0
@entity150 died in the space shuttle @entity123 accident but dr @entity120 , a former @entity109 flight surgeon who lost his wife , @entity153 , in the space shuttle @entity123 accident and dedicated himself to improving crew escape systems , was in charge of @entity3 's medical team			1
and he was thrilled at how much was learned			0
@entity120 said his team is still analyzing all the medical data - heart rate , blood pressure and the like - collected from sensors on @entity3 's body			1
@entity3 's technique for righting himself may prove useful for companies like @entity165 that are developing spacecraft that will take tourists up into space and right back down			1
these enterprises will need to have some sort of emergency escape plan			0
as for the now - ended shuttle program , @entity123 was traveling too high and too fast during its 2003 descent for a @entity3 - style exit to have helped the seven astronauts			2
the spaceship broke apart about 40 miles up while traveling more than @entity177 , unleashing forces that tore the crew members ' bodies apart			0
in the 1986 challenger disaster , the crew capsule shot out of the fireball that erupted during liftoff , but there are too many unknowns to say whether any lessons from @entity3 's feat might have applied to that tragedy , @entity133 said			2
@entity3 's pressurized suit - a close cousin of the orange suits used by shuttle astronauts and the suits worn by high - altitude @entity195 spy pilots - was designed for use in a standing , free - falling position , while conventional spacesuits are made primarily for sitting			2
by all accounts , the new suit performed well			0
' i think all of us here in our lab specifically who have dealt with the shuttle suits have looked at this in wonder and amazement , and really appreciated what they did , ' @entity133 said			0
' and that efficiency that they brought it forth with is also a model for us to learn from as well			0

@entity3 , the parachutist who jumped to @entity25 from the edge of space , hurtled towards @entity25 at 10 mph quicker than original *calculations*
the @entity8 fell from 248 feet lower than expected but remains the only human to break the sound barrier with just his body
