the government has bought more than 3,000 special crash site screens to stop drivers ' rubbernecking ’ when passing motorway accidents			2
the new partitions will be put up to deter drivers who slow down to look at crashes on the opposite carriageway and therefore slow down the traffic behind			0
partition : 3,000 screens , measuring 2.1m by 2m , have been purchased by the government to prevent motorists from slowing down to stare at motorway accident scenes , therefore causing traffic jams the screens have cost the government £ 2.3 million - with each set priced at £ 22,000			1
the @entity25 will have access to 105 sets of 30 screens , forming part of the @entity31 ’s ‘ clear ’ initiative			1
the scheme aims to improve accident clear - up times , with ministers promising that the screens will help ‘ keep the motorways flowing ’			1
the clear scheme – an acronym that stands for @entity40 , lead , @entity41 , @entity42 and reopen - was launched last year to help ensure motorways and roads reopen quickly following major accidents			1
as part of this scheme , 105 sets of incident screens will be made available for use by the @entity25 next year			1
each set can be loaded onto purpose - built trailers that can screen up to 75 metres if used end - to - end			2
the individual screens measure 2.1m by 2m high			0
the government estimates that the scheme will save the @entity58 economy ‘ tens of millions of pounds ' every year			1
congestion : it is hoped the screens will ease congestion following accidents on motorways			0
the screens cost £ 2.3 million a @entity31 spokesman said : ’ the planned roll out of incident screens shields collisions and prevents rubber necking			1
time savings associated with screens alone can be up to several hundred thousand pounds per incident			0
' a well as the screens , the @entity31 has helped fund funded 38 @entity76 laser scanners that allow police forces to capture evidence quickly following collisions by mapping out where vehicles and wreckage lies in the road after a smash			2
other initiatives include the launch of a new hands - free smart phone app that notifies users of incidents and congestion			2
the government hopes the measures will reduce the estimated £ 750m cost to the economy that caused by traffic incidents on @entity97 's roads every year			1
roads minister @entity98 said : ‘ this will be another great advantage to hopefully clearing up collisions but also getting the roads moving rather more quickly afterwards			0
cost : it is estimated that traffic incidents on @entity97 's roads cost the economy £ 750 million every year ‘ people will recognise these screens , recognise that something 's happening behind it , but actually realise it wo n't impact on their motorway - there 's nothing to see , and we want to keep the motorways flowing			1
’ assistant chief constable @entity115 , who takes the lead on collision investigations for the @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , said : ‘ this equipment allows police to manage critical events in a more efficient way and present the most accurate and detailed evidence to criminal , civil and coroners ' courts			0
’ @entity127 director , @entity126 , said the use of the screens should be welcomed , noting : ’ incident screens reduce disruption to traffic following an incident and assist the emergency services			2
‘ ensuring that motorists not involved in an incident complete their journeys safely and on time is important			0
the economy relies on an efficient road network			0
traffic jams following incidents increase frustration and the risk of low speed collisions			0
