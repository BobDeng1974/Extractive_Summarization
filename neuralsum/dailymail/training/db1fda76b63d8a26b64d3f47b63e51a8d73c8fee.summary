by @entity0 published : 04:30 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 05:36 est , 10 september 2012 a mother who gave birth when she was just 24 weeks pregnant had to wait five weeks to cuddle her daughter because the baby was so small her head was the size of a satsuma			1
@entity8 , 26 , went into labour on @entity10 ’ eve last year when she was only just over halfway through her pregnancy term			1
when little @entity13 was born , she weighed just 1ib 3ozs , and was kept in hospital for almost five months			1
' miracle ' : @entity16 was born four months premature on @entity17 last year and was so small that her head was the size of a satsuma ' miracle ' : parents @entity8 and @entity21 hold @entity22			1
at birth , her head was the size of a satsuma and her grandmother knitted her a tiny hat @entity22 ’s head was the size of a satsuma and her hand barely covered the surface of her father @entity31 ’s fingernail			1
mrs @entity8 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ' she was absolutely tiny			1
the hardest part was not being allowed to pick her up and cuddle - i had to wait five - and - a - half weeks to do that			2
' we were allowed to touch her through the incubator but i was always worried i would pass something on to her			2
' mrs @entity8 ’s grandmother , @entity41 , 77 , knitted a tiny hat for @entity22 as no clothing available to buy would fit her			1
when the mother - to - be had a mild stomach ache on december 31 , she thought it was something she had eaten , and did not imagine she was about to meet her daughter			2
big smile : @entity22 is now eight months old and is living with her parents after five months in hospital but , within just two hours , mrs @entity8 was at @entity52 and @entity53 in labour , hoping her new arrival would survive			1
she said : ' when i first went into labour , it never entered my head she might come early			2
' @entity31 and i did n’t say anything to each other about what could happen to our baby but we were both terrified			2
' we both knew what the odds were that she would n’t survive but we just tried to stay positive			0
the doctors were really calm and reassuring - i presume because they wanted to stop me from worrying			0
' when @entity22 was born , she was taken away straight away and worked on by the team			1
she was just so tiny			0
i just held my husband ’s hand and prayed			0
' @entity22 was given a blood transfusion - one of nine she had in four months , and it is thanks to the quick and skilled delivery team at @entity52 and @entity53 that @entity22 is alive today			1
she was then moved straight to @entity75 ( @entity75 ) for more specialised care			0
mr @entity21 , a 31 - year - old plumber , said : ' i went in the ambulance with @entity22 to @entity75			1
' doctors were working on her right through the journey - the longest of my life			0
' it was surreal seeing everyone out on @entity10 ’ @entity82 dressed up and having a good time , and i was in an ambulance pleading for our little girl to be ok			0
' we were lucky to get a place at @entity75 but we are so grateful we did - the medical staff there were incredible , what could have happened without them is n’t worth thinking about			0
' while at @entity75 , @entity22 was given heart surgery to close a valve and allow more blood to flow properly , giving her more oxygen			1
she also had laser eye surgery to save her sight as the blood vessels in her eyes were not properly developed			0
mrs @entity8 said : ' despite @entity22 having to go through all the operations and transfusions , we were more worried we would be told she had caught an infection			1
' so many babies look like they ’re getting there and then they pick up an infection and they do n’t survive			0
it was just a terrifying time			0
' proud : grandmother @entity41 with the bonnet she knitted for @entity22 worrying times : mr @entity21 holds tiny @entity13 shortly after she was born bonding : mrs @entity8 gave birth at 24 weeks just hours after she started to suffer a mild stomach ache @entity22 was discharged from hospital on april 9 - ten days before mrs @entity8 ’s original due date - something rarely heard of in cases of such premature babies			1
mrs @entity8 said : ' it was such a relief to bring @entity22 home - it was such an intense environment on the ward			1
i would find myself just sitting and looking at the monitors , it was so stressful			0
' the proud parents would visit their tiny daughter twice each day to give her the encouragement to get better			2
mr @entity21 said : ' our families were amazing throughout the whole time we were in hospital with @entity22			1
our parents would go in and siblings			0
@entity22 definitely knew how much she was loved			2
' it took it out of all of us - we just did n’t know what to expect			0
i think our families found it hard because it was such a scary environment			0
' but eight - month - old @entity22 is now back at home and out of the woods			2
mrs @entity8 said : ' i looked after her in hospital but we had to be careful when she first came out because she was still vulnerable			1
' we had n’t bought any stuff so we had to go out and buy everything in about a week			0
' it feels good to have her with me all the time and be able to treat her like a normal baby			0
' she ’s our little miracle			0
