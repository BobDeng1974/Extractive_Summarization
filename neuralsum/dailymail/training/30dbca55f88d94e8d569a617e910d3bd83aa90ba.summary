by @entity0 and @entity1 misleading : @entity2 , pictured , claimed he was 15 - meaning he would receive free care from the state - when he was actually 20 he claimed the taxpayer should fund his £ 10,000 flying lessons after his family abandoned him as a child			1
now it appears that @entity2 may have lied about his age to milk the public purse for tens of thousands of pounds			2
the failed asylum seeker pretended to be 15 years old so that he could be cared for as a destitute child – while in reality he was a grown man of almost 20			1
he also claimed his mother was missing and his father either dead or in prison , but the @entity20 ’s inquiries reveal that he is still in touch with his family			1
they own a three - storey house in one of the wealthiest neighbourhoods of @entity26 , the @entity27 capital , where mr @entity2 grew up			1
his lies mean he has wrongly received two years of accommodation , living expenses and schooling paid for by @entity32			1
and because he was a so - called ‘ looked - after child ’ , it has meant the authority has been forced to pay for his flying lessons , even though he turns 26 this month			1
the disclosures sparked outrage among politicians , who said the @entity41 system was too easy to exploit			0
@entity43 mp @entity42 said : ‘ this new evidence suggests @entity41 ’s compassion has been badly abused			0
‘ proving age can be hard and we must never shut the door on any child who genuinely needs help but it should not lead to well - meaning authorities being taken for a ride like this			0
’ @entity55 , of the @entity56 ’ @entity54 , added : ‘ this whole case appears to have been a calculated scam to rip off taxpayers			0
the council were n’t even responsible for this man ’s care , so any suggestion that we should still pay for his flying lessons is ludicrous			2
‘ given the pious tone taken by @entity69 ’s lawyers , and the costs of their legal action , there are serious questions about where the bill for this case should fall			0
it certainly should n’t land on taxpayers ’ doorsteps			0
’ @entity32 was forced to pay £ 10,000 for mr @entity2 to train as a pilot after it lost a case in the @entity81 earlier this year			1
it will also pay for his living expenses , likely to total £ 10,000 , while he lives in @entity84 for a year			1
his lawyers won the case by arguing that the council had a duty to pay for ‘ education expenses ’ after he left school because he had no parents			2
in touch : mr @entity2 's parents , @entity93 and @entity94 , are listed as friends on his @entity97 page , though he claims they abandoned him mr @entity2 claimed in an interview this week that he believed his father , @entity99 , was in prison or had been killed because he was involved in politics			1
he insists that the £ 10,000 is a loan and he fully intends to pay the money back if and when he qualifies as a pilot			2
he said his father had abandoned him and his younger brother @entity106 , 20 , after their asylum claim was rejected in 2004			1
he also said his older brother @entity109 , now 28 , looked after them for three years before leaving them stranded in 2007			0
but on monday , he had the pair listed as ‘ friends ’ on @entity97 , with @entity109 stating on his profile that he lives in @entity84			1
mr @entity2 ’s father has worked as an air traffic controller for @entity117 and lives in a three - bedroom house worth £ 90,000 in a middle - class suburb of @entity26			1
the house , which he shares with his wife @entity121 , was built by mr @entity99 after his application for asylum failed in the @entity41			1
a neighbour said the couple had two vehicles – one an 11 seater minibus – and they employ a maid			0
the locals could not explain how mr @entity99 came into the money to build his home , which was much grander than his old one in a run - down part of town			2
a neighbour said : ‘ he built the house himself and it only took about eight months			0
now it is worth treble the price			0
’ affluent area : this three - storey house was built by mr @entity2 's father - whom he claimed in an interview this week was dead or in prison instead of sending his three boys to the local government school where education is free , the @entity142 paid about £ 500 a year to send them to a private school			1
registration documents completed when @entity69 enrolled in nursery at @entity150 church school confirm his date of birth as the seventh day of the third month of 1980 , which is november 17 , 1987 in the @entity41 calendar			0
his baptism certificate confirmed the details			0
his uncle , who lived just around the corner , was a pilot for @entity27 airlines and three of @entity2 ’s classmates are also now pilots			1
his fellow classmates were the sons and daughters of middle - class parents - the majority of them working as civil servants and others as doctors or engineers			0
a school friend , @entity169 , 25 , said they had a happy childhood and were privileged to be enrolled in one of the best schools in the country			0
when the boys and their father left in 2004 and claimed asylum in the @entity41 , @entity173 claimed he was aged 13 , but in reality he was 16 or 17			1
@entity2 and @entity106 were granted discretionary leave to stay in the @entity41 until november 2014 , and there is no guarantee their permission will be extended			2
they were placed in council care and lived with a foster mother			0
learn to fly : mr @entity2 posted this picture to @entity97 of him in a cockpit			1
he paid for flying lessons with a £ 10,000 loan from @entity32 they applied for post- 18 courses last autumn but found they were not eligible for student loans because of their immigration status			2
they then instructed lawyers to make a claim for the money with @entity32 , which paid out £ 30,000 in legal fees fighting the case			2
the council lost , meaning it has to pay £ 10,000 to each brother in tuition fees and an estimated £ 10,000 in living expenses every year to fund their post-school education			1
the money has been given to them as a loan , to be repaid once they start work			0
@entity211 is currently studying for a degree at @entity213			0
@entity214 , of @entity215 , said of @entity2 : ‘ our client denies that he has lied about his age			2
‘ if you publish the allegation in the manner you propose you will be alleging that our client has committed fraud and contempt of court , allegations of the utmost severity that our client unequivocally denies			0
’ a spokesman for @entity32 said it would look at any evidence produced by the @entity20 in relation to the case .			0

@entity2 forced @entity32 to pay for pilot training
he was an asylum seeker who claimed he was abandoned by his family
records show he was actually 20 when he went into care rather than 15
that would make him *ineligible* for free training and living expenses
he also said he lost touch with his family - but has them as @entity97 friends
mr @entity2 claimed his father was dead or in prison - in fact he owns a three - storey house in an affluent suburb of @entity26
