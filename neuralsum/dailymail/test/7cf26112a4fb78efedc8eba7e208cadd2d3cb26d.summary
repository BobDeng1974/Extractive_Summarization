@entity0 will today accuse the @entity1 of making it harder to see a gp as they attempt to put the @entity4 back at the centre of the election campaign			1
the party will launch a billboard advert using the image from the famous 1979 ‘ @entity10 ’ poster , but instead it will warn : ‘ the doctor ca n’t see you now ’			2
the poster features the same long line of people used to illustrate dole queues under @entity19 ’s ailing government , but this time places them outside a waiting room			0
it will also claim nearly two million more patients are unhappy with doctors opening hours compared to three years ago as they lose access to appointments outside of office hours			0
shadow health secretary @entity37 will say the figures are a timely reminder of the ‘ @entity4 crisis ’ as patients turn to stretched @entity43 departments as they struggle to get an appointment with their gp on the first working day after the @entity46 break			1
but the @entity1 last night claimed many of the problems stemmed from @entity0 ’s 2004 changes to @entity3 contracts that allowed them to opt out of providing care outside office hours			1
health secretary @entity53 also said that the government had already begun tackling the issue by making extra funding available , which will mean the number of @entity3 surgeries opening longer will have increased when the next set of figures are published			0
as it unveils its new poster , @entity0 will release a new document that it claims shows how @entity63 has failed to implement seven - day opening for @entity3 surgeries as he promised before the last election			2
the original poster depicts a queue to an @entity68 mr @entity63 repeated the pledge at last week ’s televised leaders debate , claiming he wanted @entity71 to open ‘ all the way through the week ’			1
but official figures show the proportion of gp practices offering extended hours has fallen from 77 per cent in 2009 to 72 per cent in the latest figures for 2013/14			0
@entity0 said this means 590 fewer gp surgeries are now open at evenings and weekends compared to its last year in office			1
@entity4 @entity30 ’s annual gp - patient survey of 900,000 patients also shows growing unhappiness with @entity3 surgery opening hours between 2012 and the latest figures for 2015 , according to the party			1
it says there has been an increase of 1.9 million in the number of people saying their surgery is not open at convenient times from 8,393,162 to 10,261,435			0
mr @entity37 will say : ‘ today , across the country , people will face the frustration of joining a queue to see their gp – in some places the lines will go out of the surgery door			1
‘ after five years of @entity63 , patients at hundreds of surgeries can no longer get a gp appointment when they need one			0
‘ at the last election , he promised to open @entity3 surgeries seven days a week but the reality is that millions more patients are unhappy with opening hours			2
‘ it is now harder to get an appointment from monday to friday too			0
‘ one of @entity63 ’s first acts as prime minister was to cut @entity0 ’s extended opening hours scheme and scrap our guarantee of an appointment within 48 hours			1
if @entity63 gets back in , his extreme spending cuts mean he ca n’t protect the @entity4 and the queues outside gp surgeries will get even worse			2
’ former prime minister @entity119 acknowledges a crowd on october 13 , 1989 , at the end of the @entity123 conference in @entity124 mr @entity53 last night said that when the 2014/15 figures for gps opening at evening and weekends are published they will show that the number has actually increased since 2010 because of new initiatives			1
he said : ‘ @entity0 ’s figures are wrong			1
the prime minister ’s @entity132 already covers 1,100 practices and helps 7.5 million patients see a gp in the evenings and at weekends			2
shadow health secretary @entity37 will say the figures are a timely reminder of the ‘ @entity4 crisis ’ ‘ we are extending this scheme to cover over 1,400 additional practices , helping 10 million extra people by this time next year			1
‘ the next conservative @entity145 will deliver a truly seven - day @entity4 , putting right a problem which began with @entity0 ’s disastrous 2004 gp contract			1
’ a survey by the @entity150 last year found that nationwide , only one in three patients can secure a same - day gp appointment			0
more than one in five have to wait longer than a week , while 4 per cent have to wait two to three weeks			0
a number of surgeries were found to have long lines of patients waiting outside at 7am in a bid to try and get same - day appointments			0
the @entity0 poster is based on the famous 1979 poster that turned @entity163 and @entity164 from unknowns into household names			2
the agency masterminded all three of @entity119 ’s election victories for the conservatives			0
in 1999 ‘ @entity10 ’ was voted poster of the century by a jury of ad people assembled by the advertising industry magazine campaign			2
@entity163 and @entity164 , which is no longer run by brothers @entity176 and @entity177 , was hired by @entity178 to handle @entity0 ’s advertising at the last election , but it is not working for the party this time			0
@entity0 said its latest poster had been designed in - house .			0

600 fewer gps open in the evenings and at weekends , @entity0 has claimed
@entity37 will say the figures are a timely reminder of the ‘ @entity4 crisis ’
