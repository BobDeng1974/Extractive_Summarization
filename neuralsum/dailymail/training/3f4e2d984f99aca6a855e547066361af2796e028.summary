on a relatively bad night for @entity1 in the @entity2 against @entity3 on tuesday , it did n’t take long for old rivals to get busy			1
speaking on tv , former @entity6 midfielder @entity5 accused @entity1 supporters of failing to create the ‘ special atmosphere ’ he remembers from @entity11 nights at @entity12 , while his former team - mate @entity13 tweeted provocatively about empty seats while watching the game at home			1
‘ expanding the stadium for what , for who ? ’ @entity13 asked pithily			1
@entity20 and @entity21 look despondent after seeing their @entity11 hopes suffer a blow large sections of the @entity26 appeared empty during the @entity2 clash on tuesday some @entity1 decide to leave the stadium early after @entity3 's equaliser @entity5 was not impressed with the atmosphere after watching the game from the @entity33 studio tuesday ’s game — a 1 - 1 draw — was a big one for @entity1 , given that they had lost their opening fixture in @entity38			1
it was odd to see a smattering of empty seats at the @entity26 , just as it is odd that the club ’s @entity2 attendances are moving gently in the wrong direction			1
nevertheless , perhaps @entity5 and @entity13 have short memories			1
both enjoyed their share of big nights in the @entity2 at @entity12 but there were numerous @entity11 occasions over the past decade when @entity6 sold cut - price tickets to schools at the last minute in a bid to fill the ground			1
there were others , too , when the @entity12 atmosphere was as flat as the @entity59			0
@entity60 in particular will remember @entity6 captain @entity63 ’s famous rant after a 1 - 0 win over @entity65 took sir @entity67 ’s team through the group stages back in 2000			1
‘ at home the fans have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches and they do n’t realise what ’s going on out on the pitch , ’ said @entity63			2
‘ i do n’t think some of the people who come to @entity12 can spell football , never mind understand it			0
’ @entity79 wheels away after opening the scoring for @entity1 from the penalty spot @entity82 nets the equaliser to become the @entity2 's oldest goal scorer aged 38 @entity3 fans struggle to contain their excitement after their hero @entity82 equalises @entity6 @entity88 ( sep 1993 ) 35,781 ( capacity 44,000 ) @entity90 ( sep 1994 ) 33,625 ( capacity 44,000 ) @entity92 ( aug 2005 ) 51,701 ( capacity 68,000 ) @entity1 @entity94 ( nov 2013 ) 35,000 @entity3 ( sept 2014 ) 37,509 @entity95 ( nov 2013 ) 37,742 @entity96 so famous are those quotes that they have their own wikipedia page			1
equally interesting is that @entity63 ’s comments came only a few months after his manager had asked @entity6 ’s supporters for more noise			1
united fans will argue that they had already scaled the heights in the @entity2 back then ; that it was hard to get up for run - of - the - mill group games so soon after the drama of their 1999 final win			1
@entity1 do not have that excuse			2
this is only their fourth season in the competition and they are yet to progress beyond the last 16			0
had you offered many of their rank - and - file the chance to watch games like tuesday night 's 10 years ago , they would have swum the length of the @entity124 to get there			2
in a city like @entity127 , however , there are always financial issues to consider			0
@entity129 , who runs the website @entity131 , said : ‘ @entity13 is living in his own bubble			2
some people are living hand to mouth and he ’s criticising them for not filling the stadium			0
@entity5 and @entity13 ( @entity137 ) criticised @entity1 for not creating a special atmosphere like @entity12 @entity63 coined the phrase ' prawn sandwich brigade ' after this game against @entity65 in 2000 stands were not always packed during @entity2 nights at @entity12 ' away from home our fans are fantastic , i 'd call them the hardcore fans			1
but at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches , and they do n't realise what 's going on out on the pitch			2
' i do n't think some of the people who come to @entity12 can spell football , never mind understand it			0
' ‘ he was an absolute disgrace on @entity159 , as was @entity5 on @entity33			2
’ @entity1 ’s owners have only targeted the last eight this time and do n’t expect @entity163 to win the competition just yet			2
one view is that @entity1 fans prefer to watch @entity168 football as it is a competition they feel they can win			1
whatever the case , the club themselves remain sanguine about attendance levels and point out that they do n’t make the purchase of @entity2 tickets compulsory for those with season tickets , as @entity6 and @entity178 do			1
@entity6 can fall back on memories of winning the competition in 1999 ( above ) and 2008 @entity1 fans do not necessarily expect @entity163 to win the @entity2 this year a small collection of @entity1 fans hold up letters to spell the @entity186 manager 's name they know their fan base is considerably smaller than @entity6 ’s but the @entity189 sells out for every game in the @entity2 and research tells them that enough games are over-subscribed to make a 6,000 - seat stadium expansion — already under way — worthwhile			1
at times , when the @entity189 is less than full , it can seem a rather over-ambitious project			2
however , @entity1 do have a waiting list of 7,500 for season tickets and deposits have already been paid on every one of the new seats for next season			1
as ever , @entity1 remain sure of themselves and their visions			2
all they need to do now is put right some of the problems that continue to affect them on the field on @entity11 nights			0
outplayed in losing 1 - 0 in @entity38 , @entity1 spent much of tuesday ’s game on the back foot once more and , despite captain @entity20 ’s attempts to claim otherwise , @entity163 has a real issue with the poor form of @entity21 in the centre of his midfield			1
there are plans to increase the capacity of the @entity26 to 55,000 with an extra 6,000 seats unlike @entity221 's side , at least @entity1 are in the @entity2 this season once again on tuesday it was the failure of @entity21 and his central partner @entity223 to assume control that allowed @entity3 to move forward on to @entity163 ’s back four			1
‘ he ’s done so much for this club , he ’s always played brilliantly , ’ said @entity226			0
‘ for me he is always an important player ,			0
when he does well the team does well			0
he has set the standards very high for himself			0
to say he ’s not at his best , i do n’t agree			0
it ’s so early in the season to call something like this , things will improve			0
’ @entity20 ’s loyalty is admirable but it ’s undeniable that @entity1 improved on tuesday once @entity237 replaced @entity238 , allowing @entity21 to push up behind forward @entity79			0
it surely ca n’t be long before @entity163 does this routinely in @entity11			0
for the time being , @entity1 ’s critics will perhaps revel in their perceived struggles , both on and off the field in @entity11			0
city do , however , have one rather obvious card to play when their neighbours start to dig at them about @entity2 matters			0
at least they are in the competition .			0

@entity1 were held to a 1 - 1 draw with @entity3 in @entity2
former @entity6 *legends* @entity5 and @entity13 *critcised* the poor atmosphere at the @entity26
both are forgetting @entity63 's rant over the ' prawn sandwich brigade ' after *lacklustre* @entity6 support during win against @entity65 in 2000
despite empty seats , @entity1 still have plans to expand the stadium by 6,000
@entity189 sells out for every @entity168 match and @entity1 have a 7,500 - person waiting list for season tickets
