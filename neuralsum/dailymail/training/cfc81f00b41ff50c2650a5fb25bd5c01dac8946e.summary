they probably generate more sheepish looks and furious hand signals than any other part of the road network			0
but this particular box junction infuriates drivers more than most			1
angry motorists have dubbed the cross-hatched area the ‘ @entity10 ’ after it generated £ 2.7million in fines for the local council last year			1
the @entity10 : the @entity12 's @entity11 with new @entity13 , @entity14 , described as a trap because an average 11 drivers are caught on camera stopping in the yellow grid every single day a total of 40,634 penalty notices were issued to motorists in 2011 - 2012 – an average of 111 a day			1
this is nearly three times the number of motorists caught out in the previous 12 months and more than five times the amount two years earlier			0
suspicious drivers have accused @entity28 and @entity29 , in @entity30 , of designing the junction to deliberately catch them out and create a cash cow			1
and similar traps could spring up across the country if councils outside @entity30 have their way and win the right to impose fines for a variety of highway offences			1
drivers should enter a box junction only if the exit road or lane is clear			1
they can wait inside it if they want to turn right and are stopped from doing so by oncoming traffic or other vehicles queuing to turn right			0
but motorists argue that the @entity10 – at the junction of fashionable but heavily congested new @entity13 and @entity50 in @entity14 – has two sets of traffic lights which allow more motorists to enter the controlled area than can leave it			2
trap : how drivers are lured on to the yellow lines one to avoid : this map shows the location of the junction in @entity14 , west @entity30 at the moment only councils in @entity30 have the power to issue fines for traffic violations , like the ones at @entity14 's @entity10			1
however about 20 councils from across the @entity69 have held talks with the government about taking over the enforcement of 26 driving offences from police			0
at present they can only fine drivers for parking offences and driving in bus lanes , but if they win the new powers their remit will be expanded to include making u-turns and driving in cycle lanes , as well as stopping in a box junction and a range of other offences			1
campaigners have said they fear councils will use the fines as a stealth tax to raise revenue			2
as a result , many are receiving £ 65 fines , which rise to £ 130 if they are not paid within two weeks			1
victims include @entity94 more , who lives in @entity95 , @entity96 , and has been fined twice			0
she said : ‘ there ’s something fundamentally wrong with the number of fines issued to drivers going into this junction			1
it seems the council has decided this is a really good money - making scheme			0
‘ the yellow box is far too long			1
it does n’t give you enough time to get out and the signalling is awful			0
’ musician @entity109 added : ‘ drivers are frequently lured into the yellow box and trapped there by traffic lights			1
it is a complex , confusing and unclear junction			0
’ fines are being issued to drivers heading along new @entity13 towards @entity116			2
as they enter the junction , another set of lights 110ft up the road remains red for between 25 and 40 seconds			2
only four cars can wait legally behind the first lights , leaving the rest at risk of being spotted on @entity126			0
tickets are automatically sent to the vehicle owner			0
motorists are also getting caught as they wait to turn right into @entity50 from new @entity13			0
a council spokesman said no one would be penalised if they ‘ just stuck to the rules ’ , but @entity133 said it would consider improving the junction			2
about 20 councils have asked to take over enforcement of 26 road offences from police , including those involving box junctions , u-turns and cycle lanes			2
critics say they will be used to generate income .			0

cameras trained on the yellow box on the junction of @entity12 's @entity151 , @entity30 , catch more than 100 drivers every day
observations of the junction found that at least one vehicle gets stuck inside the box every time the lights change
many receive £ 65 fines , which rise to £ 130 if not paid within two weeks
similar traps could spring up across the country if councils have their way
