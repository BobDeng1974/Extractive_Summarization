photos from an unreleased and potentially massive collection of stolen celebrity nudes can be bought online for $ 350			1
more evidence is emerging that this summer 's celebrity nude leaks were only a peek at how many photos and videos were compromised through security flaws in @entity10 's @entity9			1
@entity12 's @entity11 found that the internet users eagerly trading in stolen celebrity nudes have moved on from forums like @entity15 and @entity16 to a @entity18 site called @entity19 and that sellers are offering entire unseen collections for hundreds			1
more victims : sellers claiming to have more stolen photos from celebrities such as @entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) have moved them online through encrypted email or file - sharing sites like @entity19 market : users on the ' realtime filesharing ' site @entity19 use the chat function to discuss the upload of stolen photos and videos and uploaders solicit donations in bitcoin timing : a scrolling list of files available to view in each room is refreshed whenever a new file is uploaded and shows the amount of time left before a file disappears from the server a ' realtime filesharing ' site with a chat function , @entity19 allows users to post images and other files , some of it pornographic in nature , that disappear after a short period of time			1
that 's where @entity11 found many photos were being traded between users , with leaks of celebrities like actresses @entity28 and @entity66 being shared , to the praise of other users			2
one account tried to take the moral high ground , asking that users should go donate to @entity73 's campaign against @entity74 if they appreciated his leak of a hacked video of actress @entity66			2
dealer : @entity12 posed as a buyer and contacted sets ahoy through encrypted email , who offered sets of nudes for around $ 350 still unreleased : sets ahoy peddled photos that have not been released publicly on sites like @entity16 and @entity15 other users in @entity19 rooms made requests for underage photos of celebrities like @entity94 olympian @entity93 , who would have been under 18 in many of the shared photos allegedly of her			1
even @entity15 , which was criticized for tolerating the hacked photos for a time in spite of otherwise strict anti-doxing policies , had cracked down on leaks like @entity93 's			0
@entity101 , creator of @entity102 , deleted the chatrooms after being contacted by @entity12 and rooted out rooms uploaders had planned to fall back on after the original ones were closed			0
he said he deletes rooms violating the site 's terms of use as they are discovered			2
but outside of @entity19 , bigger stashes of hacked photos that have not yet leaked are being sold by dealers in exchange for bitcoins			1
one dealer named @entity116 , who sells collections of photos by the dozen , was contacted through his encrypted email address and offered to sell sets of celebrities such as @entity125 model @entity27			1
' today it 's been 1 btc , ' read the email sent to @entity12 , who posed as a buyer			0
' i do offer discounts for multiple sets though			0
' the cryptocurrency is currently trading just under $ 350 for one bitcoin			0
sets @entity135 verified his samples of the photos through a @entity139 link , then deleted them			0
it is not certain how the cloud - based file storage site will respond to the use of their site			0
what this does show is that , in spite of this summer 's massive leak and subsequent responses from @entity10 and @entity152 over cloud - computing 's security flaws , the community sharing celebrity nudes was only temporarily disrupted			1
altogether , dealers and other collectors may be holding onto thousands of photos of celebrities , and simply staying quiet			2
that 's in addition to the unknown number of photos of non-celebrities whose photos hackers have quietly been stealing for years , as @entity166 pointed out .			0

*private* dealers are offering photos that *include* celebrities such as @entity125 model @entity27 over encrypted email exchanges in exchange for bitcoins
users are also requesting and sharing celebrity nudes , *including* underage photos , on the @entity18 ' realtime filesharing ' site @entity19
@entity19 says it 's deleting rooms where celebrity nude photos are being uploaded as soon as it learns of affected rooms
