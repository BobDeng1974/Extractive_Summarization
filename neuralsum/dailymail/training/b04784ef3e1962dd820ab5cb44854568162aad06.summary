for decades , researchers have been trying in vain to decipher ancient texts written on the @entity3 - and a @entity5 researcher claims he has cracked it			1
the world - renowned 600 year old manuscript is full of illustrations of exotic plants , stars , and mysterious human figures , as well as many pages written in an unknown text			1
now @entity15 , professor of @entity16 at the @entity17 , say he has decoded words in it for the first time			1
over time it has attained an infamous reputation , even featuring in the latest hit computer game @entity37 , as well as in the @entity39 novels , when @entity40 decoded the @entity41 and used it to find the ‘ @entity43 ’			2
however in reality no one has come close to revealing the @entity41 ’s true messages unitl now			0
many grand theories have been proposed			0
some suggest it was the work of @entity50 as a boy , or secret @entity52 , or the lost tribe of @entity54 , or most recently @entity55 … some have even proclaimed it was done by aliens			0
professor @entity15 is using linguistic analysis to work on the script letter by letter ' i hit on the idea of identifying proper names in the text , following historic approaches which successfully deciphered @entity69 hieroglyphs and other mystery scripts , and i then used those names to work out part of the script , ' he said			2
' the manuscript has a lot of illustrations of stars and plants			1
i was able to identify some of these , with their names , by looking at medieval herbal manuscripts in @entity82 and other languages , and i then made a start on a decoding , with some exciting results			0
' among the words he has identified is the term for @entity90 , alongside a picture of seven stars which seem to be the @entity94 , and also the word @entity95 alongside a picture of the plant @entity99 , a known mediaeval herb , as well as a number of other plants			2
altogether @entity15 says he has worked out : @entity103 , @entity90 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			0
although professor @entity15 admits his decoding is still only partial , it has generated a lot of excitement in the world of codebreaking and linguistics because it could prove a crucial breakthrough for an eventual full decipherment			2
' my aim in reporting on my findings at this stage is to encourage other linguists to work with me to decode the whole script using the same approach , though it still wo n’t be easy			0
' that way we can finally understand what the mysterious authors were trying to tell us , ' he added			2
' but already my research shows conclusively that the manuscript is not a hoax , as some have claimed , and is probably a treatise on nature , perhaps in a @entity137 or @entity138 language			2
' the word cotton was one of the first to be decoded , after the plant was identified and a word on the page translated as kooton the research also uncovered the name of the @entity146 recently a @entity148 botanist studied illustrations of the plants throughout the 15th century book and pinpointed a number of them to the @entity155 region now known as @entity156			1
dr. @entity157 claims at least 37 of the 303 plants would have grown in the region during the 15th and 16th century and believes the text is , therefore , written in the @entity55 language of @entity161			1
@entity161 originated in @entity156 during the 7th century			0
it was the spoken predominantly by the @entity55			0
following the @entity165 conquest of @entity156 in the 16th century , the alphabet was replaced with @entity166			0
@entity161 became a literary language , used in poetry and passages , similar to the @entity41 manuscript			2
varieties of @entity161 are still spoken by approximately 1.5 million @entity173 people in @entity156			0
the writing is so bizarre , sceptics have stated the book is a hoax or that the writing is nonsense			0
the voynich manuscript was discovered in an @entity182 monastery in 1912 by book dealer @entity41			1
carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created between approximately 1404 and 1438 , during the @entity186			2
the 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin , known as vellum , and are decorated with illustrations , diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right			1
examples include the illustration of the @entity198 , top left , taken from the @entity200 which has an identical style to the @entity202 in the manuscript , bottom left			1
a @entity41 illustration of a cactus pad or fruit , right , is shown near the name ‘ nashtli ’ , which dr. @entity157 and @entity211 claim is a variant of the word ‘ nochtil ’ - the @entity161 name for the fruit of the prickly pear if the text , pictured far left , is written in the language of @entity161 , the botanists claim they can find the name of the plants in the manuscript			1
from this , cryptographers may be able to form a basic code from which to crack the rest of the text in the 15th century book due to its mysterious nature , the text has been studied by cryptographers around the world , yet no - one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages			1
dr. @entity157 from @entity237 took a different approach , and instead , studied the plants depicted throughout the book			0
he discovered similarities between specific plants in the manuscript and illustrations of plants he had spotted in his collection of 16th century @entity249 records			1
the voynich manuscript was discovered in an @entity182 monastery in 1912 by book dealer @entity41			1
carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created in the early 15th century , between approximately 1404 and 1438 , during the @entity186			2
the 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin , known as vellum			0
each page is decorated with illustrations , diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right			1

this has led to many people claim the book is hoax , or that the writing is nonsense			0
due to the manuscript ’s discovery in @entity182 , many researchers believe the book to have originated in @entity280 , however , the latest research from dr. @entity157 suggests it may have been written by the @entity55 in what is now modern - day @entity156			1
for example , dr. @entity157 and fellow researcher @entity211 said one plant in the book bears a resemblance to the picture of a soap plant ( xiuhamolli ) seen in a @entity249 codex from 1552			0
while another example includes the illustration of the @entity198 , taken from the @entity200 , which has an identical style to the @entity202 in the manuscript			2
in total , the researchers linked 37 of the 303 plants in the manuscript to illustrations in ancient @entity249 books covering botany across @entity302 , @entity303 and @entity304			1
due to its mysterious nature , the text and diagrams in the manuscript , pictured , have been studied by cryptographers around the world , yet no - one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages			1
this has led to many people claim the book is hoax , or that the writing is nonsense @entity161 , pictured here written in the @entity318 , originated in @entity156 during the 7th century			2

for example , a @entity41 illustration of a cactus pad or fruit is shown near the name ‘ nashtli ’ , which @entity157 and @entity211 claim is a variant of the word ‘ nochtil ’ - the nahuatl name for the fruit of the prickly pear			0
