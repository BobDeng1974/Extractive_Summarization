@entity0 admitted his @entity2 side were lucky to get a draw against @entity4 @entity5 made a number of impressive saves to deny @entity4 a winning goal in @entity24 ' we could ( have lost ) so the result is a positive one , ' @entity0 told @entity28			1

it was a difficult match			0

he said : ' i had in this team five players that did n't train			1
five players since the game against @entity61 they did n't train once			0

' the @entity75 stopper , preferred to @entity76 , tips @entity11 's header wide in the first half @entity10 rises highest to head home the opener , giving @entity2 a precious away goal the impressive @entity11 equalised shortly after the break , heading home @entity84 's cross the result means the west @entity87 are well placed to progress - certainly better , in @entity89 's view , than when they advanced to the semi-finals at @entity4 's expense last term on away goals after losing 3 - 1 at the @entity94			1
' i think both teams were kind of feeling each other out in the first half , ' said the @entity2 captain			1

' but it was a difficult second half			0

' i think the key was last year i think we made it very difficult for ourselves going back to @entity107 - we 're in a lot better position now			2
' listen , they 're a very good side , especially going forwards			0
it is going to be very tough but we 're in a better position than we were last year			0
' @entity5 was particularly impressive for @entity2 , making a string of fine saves after coming in for @entity76			1
