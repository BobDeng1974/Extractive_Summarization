by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 19:27 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 : 20:13 est , 18 february 2014 scientists at the @entity5 said paying closer attention to avoidable risks could cut miscarriages by 25 per cent one in four miscarriages might be preventable , researchers have said			1
paying closer attention to avoidable risks , such as being underweight or obese before conception and drinking alcohol in pregnancy , could help reduce the toll , a study claims			1
working nights and lifting heavy loads also increased the chance of miscarriage , as did being aged over 30 , the @entity18 team said			1
they claimed that if women were able to cut these risk factors to very low levels , 25 per cent of miscarriages could be prevented			1
however , other scientists warned the study did not show that these factors cause miscarriages			1
each year , a quarter of a million @entity33 women have a miscarriage			0
most happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy , but up to 10,000 occur at a later stage			2
scientists from the @entity5 , @entity18 , looked at 91,427 pregnancies between 1996 and 2002 , of which 3,177 ended in miscarriage before 22 weeks			1
at 16 weeks , women were asked about their lifestyle before conception and during pregnancy			2
those who had already had a miscarriage were asked about their habits before it took place			0
the study found age , drinking alcohol , lifting more than 44lb ( 20kg ) , night shifts and being obese or overweight were all associated with miscarriage			1
age and alcohol were the most significant factors , the report in @entity56 : an @entity57 said			2
it added : ‘ in a prevention scenario where women conceived at the age of 25 to 29 years , consumed no alcohol during pregnancy , were normal weight before pregnancy , did not lift more than 20kg daily during pregnancy , and worked only during the day , 25.2 per cent of miscarriages were preventable			1
it found drinking alcohol while pregnant , being underweight or obese were all ' avoidable risks '			1
stock image ' this scenario resulted in the highest preventable proportion of miscarriage			0
’ @entity75 , one of the researchers , said : ‘ miscarriage is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome , affecting at least one in seven pregnancies			2
’ half of all miscarriages result from chance abnormalities in the baby ’s chromosomes , which can cause the mother ’s body to reject the fetus			0
professor @entity89 , a consultant gynaecologist at @entity91 ’s @entity90 ’s and @entity92 , said : ‘ this is a big study , but it does not really say anything new			0
there are also issues of recall bias , and the fact that they show an association rather than causation			0
‘ saying that by changing x or y a percentage of miscarriages could be prevented is quite a statement in the absence of an interventional trial			0
however , it adds to the view that alcohol in pregnancy is not a good idea			2
’ @entity113 , a professor of statistics at @entity115 , said : ‘ this study does not establish a causal relationship between its reported risk factors and miscarriage			0
‘ the study has several statistical limitations , and so i caution that its conclusions may be subject to over-interpretation			0
’ he said it should not be seen as ‘ the last word ’ on the issue .			0

scientists at the @entity5 looked at 91,427 pregnancies
study found paying closer attention to avoidable risks could prevent 25 per cent of miscarriages
avoidable risks *include* being underweight , obese , drinking alcohol during pregnancy , working nights and lifting heavy loads
