by @entity0 and @entity1 for nearly three years we have waited for the pitter patter of tiny paws			2
soon , that wait could be over			2
experts are confident that giant panda @entity7 – whose name means @entity10 – is pregnant and may produce @entity12 ’s first panda cub by the end of the month			1
public interest in the panda and her mate @entity16 , or @entity18 , reached fever pitch yesterday , undimmed by two previous unsuccessful breeding attempts			1
the pair , on loan to @entity23 from @entity24 , refused to mate in 2012 , while last year @entity7 had a failed pregnancy			1
keepers have been monitoring @entity7 since she was artificially inseminated in april			1
@entity44 , director of pandas at the zoo , said the latest scientific data suggested that @entity7 is pregnant and her due date is likely to be around august 28 or 29			1
but he warned : ‘ this is all very new and complex science and we still have a bit of time to go yet , as like last year , the late loss of a cub remains entirely possible			1
’ last year keepers tried to inseminate @entity7 with a frozen sample of sperm from a dead panda , @entity59 , which had been kept at @entity61 zoo			1
the foetus was not carried to full term			0
the latest attempt used sperm from @entity16			0
if the pregnancy is successful , it could mean a £ 50million boost to the @entity30 economy , studies suggest – and put @entity30 firmly into the international spotlight weeks before the independence referendum on september 18			1
a team of up to nine people will be on hand to help deliver the cub , including two experts due to arrive from @entity24 next week mr @entity44 said : ‘ we ’re very excited			2
we know she is now pregnant from the tests that we have been running			0
it is not a phantom pregnancy			0
‘ we are using a combination of tests which give an indication of when implantation has taken place			0
' the keepers noticed that there were behavioural changes , she started to become less co-operative and wanted to spend less time eating and more in the cubbing box			0
' that also ties in with the science			0
‘ we do n’t know how many cubs there are			2
we know at least one – we do n’t know whether there is another one in there , or another two			0
’ while giant pandas are famously reluctant to mate , both in captivity and in the wild , and pregnancies often fail even if they do , @entity7 has had cubs in the past in @entity24			1
she and @entity16 arrived on loan from @entity24 in december 2011 following five years of talks between officials and became the first giant pandas to live in the @entity12 for 17 years			0
the animals , both aged ten , will remain at @entity23 for a decade			0
under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to @entity24 at the age of two , the age at which they would normally leave their mother in the wild			2
@entity7 and @entity16 ( pictured ) are the first @entity35 to live in the @entity12 for 17 years a view from @entity23 's panda cam shows male panda @entity16 in his enclosure , hiding from the rain and many visitors outside visitors from all over the world queued to catch a glimpse of pregnant @entity7 today after the zoo announced she is expecting a cub to the dismay of visitors , the @entity35 will not be on show during her pregnancy which could see her give birth to a cub at the end of this month meanwhile , in @entity24 : pink and mostly hairless , these panda triplets are the latest success for @entity24 's artificial breeding programme two panda cubs born in @entity145 last year			1

@entity7 was artificially inseminated in april after failing to mate
@entity35 previously lost a cub after being successfully implanted
her cub , or cubs , could be born within a matter of weeks
