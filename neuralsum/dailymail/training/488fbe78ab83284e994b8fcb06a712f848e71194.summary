by @entity0 @entity1 was the uncontested best - dressed - as well as best supporting actress - at the @entity2 last night			1
the 12 years a slave actress 's baby blue @entity4 gown stood out in a sea of safe nudes and creams with a look that recalled @entity11 - right down to the sparkling band atop her head			1
@entity15 also won points for her choice of a strapless , tomato red peplum - waisted gown			1
as the face of @entity22 she has the pick of the collection , and she ( or rather her stylist ) chose well in a selection that not only holds its own in the style stakes , but does not overwhelm the person wearing it			1
the majority of female attendees , though , wore shimmering columns of pale sequins , which , while pretty and elegant , left us feeling like we 'd seen it all before			1
instead , it was those who wore black who were among the most interesting looks of the night			2
@entity70 , too , looked sensational in a high - necked @entity72 gown , made to accommodate her seven - months baby bump			1
the cut - out back and the panel of white gave it a @entity79 mod look that is rare at the @entity2 , and refreshing to see			2
and @entity80 saved her @entity82 gown from falling into dull territory the literal way with a sparkly breastplate			2
@entity87 , in slinky , smoky @entity86 , shows us what the designer is like at her moodiest			0
it was edgy and elegant without being too angsty teen - a trap former child stars risk falling into			2
we loved tank - like top and her high - volume , mussed - updo			2
@entity98 is back : @entity65 actress @entity60 proved that black does n't have to mean boring in this bow - backed @entity61 gown doing it differently : @entity70 in black @entity72 with a mod panel of white at the back ( left ) and @entity87 in smoky , shimmery grey - black @entity86 ( right ) accessorizing with a megawatt smile : @entity80 's @entity82 gown had a disco breastplate ( left ) while @entity56 wore black lace @entity58 ( right ) red carpet moment : @entity59 looked every inch the movie star in plunging black @entity22 of the pale sparkly numbers there were a few that stood out			1
@entity116 , as always , proved that she is one step ahead in the style stakes with a cap - sleeved @entity120 gown that was breathtakingly sleek and simple , set off by a statement @entity122 neckpiece , slicked - back hair and deep red lips			1
@entity127 's cape - shouldered @entity126 was one of the host highly - rated looks too			2
the actress does a plunging neckline like few others , and the covered shoulders were at once strong and demure			0
representing for @entity133 were @entity134 and @entity135 , while @entity136 went for @entity137 and @entity138 wore @entity139			2
@entity140 and @entity141 both looked sensational as always , but their navy strapless gowns , by @entity82 and @entity144 respectively , made for remarkably similar silhouettes			0
in the navy : gravity star @entity141 in inky silk @entity144 ( left ) and @entity149 's @entity140 in her strapless @entity82 gown ( right ) team @entity152 : 12 years a slave actress @entity135 ( left ) and @entity134 ( right ) both wore shimmering pale columns by @entity152 all - out glam : @entity127 's cape - shouldered @entity126 was one of the host highly - rated looks			1
the actress does a plunging neckline like no - one else we loved the risk taken by @entity164 cover girl @entity163 , who made a brave choice in @entity166			1
it will no doubt divide opinion , but found favor with us			0
and @entity170 was a ray of sunshine in her yellow @entity174 gown at the @entity176 party			0
over at @entity179 's viewing party , @entity177 was the belle of the ball in @entity182			0
yes , it exposed a lot of cleavage , but the color was great on her and the ballgown silhouette is one we do n't see her wear much			0
while many of the other stars in attendance at the @entity2 played it safe in sparkly white ( or variations on the pale hue ) , they do deserve credit for looking flawless nonetheless			0
best actress winner @entity136 's @entity137 ballgown was ravishing , and a little racy in that it gave the impression of being almost see - through			0
@entity202 , too , looked ravishing in her @entity204 gown with its tiers of silver fringing			0
dazzling : @entity202 in @entity204 ( left ) , @entity136 in @entity137 ( center ) and @entity138 in @entity139 ( right ) pale and interesting : @entity116 in @entity120 ( left ) , @entity209 in @entity126 ( center ) and @entity211 in @entity212 ( right ) white out : @entity213 in @entity214 ( left ) , @entity215 in @entity216 ( center ) and @entity218 in @entity219 ( right ) nor , indeed , could we expect anything close to boring from @entity209 , who wore a @entity126 gown that would probably have looked ludicrous on anyone else , but of course she pulled it off , complete with sweeping scarf by way of a train			1
we loved @entity211 for wearing an unexpected designer - @entity212 - and looking sensational in the tailored , blush pink creation , and @entity218 's @entity219 gown was pure romance			1
there were some style highlights among the tv presenters too - while most of the attention was on the a-listers , those covering the red carpet arrivals brought their a-game too			1
@entity240 looked stunning in emerald green @entity241 , as did @entity242 in @entity243			0
flower power : @entity164 cover girl @entity163 , pictured with husband @entity246 , made a brave choice in @entity166 that will no doubt divide opinion , but found favor with us something different : at the @entity176 party , we loved @entity170 's yellow @entity174 gown ( left ) , while at @entity179 's viewing party , @entity177 was the belle of the ball in @entity182 ( left )			1
and @entity257 just about pulled off this shade of @entity260 pink by @entity261 ( right ) best of the presenters , from left : @entity242 in @entity243 , @entity264 in @entity265 , @entity240 in @entity241 and @entity266 in @entity267 @entity266 looked sleek in @entity267 ( though for some inexplicable reason changed out of it to actually present on @entity270 ) and @entity264 was as glamorous as ever in @entity265			0
of course where there are fashion hits there are also fails , and alas there were some stars who took their risks too far			0
