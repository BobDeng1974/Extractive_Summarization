by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 1 july 2012 updated : 04:41 est , 2 july 2012 the @entity2 is investigating 14 @entity4 traders at the heart of the @entity7 - fixing scandal , it emerged yesterday			1
although much of the immediate political fallout over @entity4 has occurred in the @entity10 , the @entity8 could become the main legal arena for the scandal , with financial and custodial punishments dwarfing those imposed elsewhere			2
the @entity14 of @entity15 has already launched a class action suit and the brokerage firm @entity17 has brought a lawsuit in @entity19			0
probe : fourteen @entity4 traders at the heart of the @entity7 - fixing scandal are being investigated by the @entity2 ( file photograph ) the @entity17 lawsuit , filed against several banks , including @entity4 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , indicates the scale of the scandal could be far bigger than first thought			1
the @entity2 investigation was announced by assistant attorney general @entity30			0
the 14 traders under scrutiny are believed to have been based mostly in @entity33 and @entity34			1
as part of a non-prosecution agreement last week , @entity4 paid a record £ 59.5million to @entity10 ’s @entity37 , while @entity8 regulators and prosecutors took about £ 230million			1
the deal covers @entity4 but not its current and former employees			2
@entity4 has agreed to assist @entity8 investigators , essentially becoming a co-operating witness against some of its own people and rival banks			2
mr @entity30 noted last week that @entity4 had ‘ substantially assisted the @entity47 in our ongoing investigation of individuals and other financial institutions in this matter ’			2
scrutiny : the @entity2 investigation was announced by assistant attorney general @entity30 president @entity54 formed a @entity55 in 2009 which , the @entity8 @entity56 highlighted last week , was designed ‘ to wage an aggressive , co-ordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes ’			0
the result could be extraditions of bankers to face @entity8 courts – even if the alleged criminal acts did not take place on @entity8 soil			0
a 23 - page statement of facts regarding @entity4 was drawn up by the @entity56 and posted on its website and that of the @entity2			2
the document paints a picture of a network of traders conspiring on both sides of the @entity76 to manipulate both the @entity7 and @entity78 rates			1
the document , in a statement of facts agreed to by @entity4 , said ‘ interbank communications ’ included ‘ ones in which certain @entity4 swaps traders communicated with former @entity4 swaps traders who had left @entity4 and joined other financial institutions ’			1
high stakes : a lawsuit has been filed in the @entity8 against several banks , including @entity4 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 according to the @entity17 lawsuit , each bank ‘ dramatically increased its collusive suppression of @entity7 ’			1
it claims that ‘ under - reporting of @entity7 had a $ 45billion ( £ 28billion ) effect on the market ’ – a shortfall that the banks avoided paying to investors buying their financial products			1
manipulating @entity7 would have had a significant effect on pension and investment funds that buy complex financial products , known as derivatives , linked to interest rates			0
at least 16 of the world ’s biggest banks , including @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity24 , @entity26 and @entity25 , are likely to be looked at by the @entity2 or other @entity8 federal agencies			0
as well as @entity10 and the @entity8 , investigations are taking place in other @entity114 countries , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
inquiries are centred around which banks participated in the alleged collusion and whether any criminal actions were authorised or condoned by senior figures			0
@entity116 ’s @entity124 filed an affidavit against banks including @entity24 and @entity26 , demanding emails and other documents			0
according to the affidavit , one bank became a whistleblower and agreed to assist the authorities			0
a trader at the whistleblower bank is alleged to have communicated with traders at @entity24 , @entity108 , @entity26 , @entity136 and @entity137			0
last week , @entity138 , former chairman of the @entity139 , said @entity4 ’ actions over @entity7 were likely to be only ‘ the proverbial tip of the iceberg ’			1
more to come : @entity138 said @entity4 ' actions over @entity7 were likely to be only ' the proverbial tip of the iceberg '			1

traders under scrutiny are based mainly in @entity33 and @entity34
it follows the £ 290m fine given to @entity4 for fixing @entity7 *lending* rate
