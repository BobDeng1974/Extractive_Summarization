producers caused outraged when they broadcast the outcome of her affair on @entity10 's sister station when an @entity4 stalwart began an affair with her husband ’s brother , regular listeners knew it was only a matter of time before they were treated to a huge marital showdown			1

some pointed out the show is a favourite among older listeners , many of whom do not have access to a digital radio or the internet , while another said : ‘ no point in listening to the @entity4 again , if one does not get all the story line			1
’ the showdown between property developer @entity43 and his wife @entity44 was played on @entity45 , which was set up in 2011 to give @entity4 addicts behind - the - scenes material to supplement the main @entity10 show			1
the programme is broadcast on @entity50 , meaning it can only be accessed with a digital radio , through a digital television or online			1
since november , fans of the rural soap have been kept in suspense as @entity44 continued a clandestine affair with @entity43 ’s brother @entity57			1
although the romance was cut short by @entity57 ’s unexpected death from a heart attack last month , listeners were kept on tenterhooks by the knowledge that @entity43 had discovered his wife was unfaithful months earlier but chose to keep silent			0
last week , he finally confronted her with the knowledge , exclaiming : ‘ oh for @entity66 ’s sake @entity44 , stop lying			0
i know you were sleeping with @entity57			0
i know you were screwing my brother , alright			0
’ however , the dramatic scene was heard by just a quarter of @entity4 ’ regular fans			2
the main programme on @entity10 is heard by an average of 5.1million listeners each week , while just 1.6million tune in to @entity50			1
many of those who missed the scene wrote to the @entity21 ’s own radio 4 programme feedback – which regularly discusses listeners ’ views – to complain			1
one said : ‘ i ’m outraged at the way in which the ordinary listener to the @entity4 has been deprived of listening to this scene … i think people who listen to the @entity4 on ordinary steam or fm radio should have been able to hear this scene			2
popular : the @entity4 is listened to by an average of 5.1million viewers a week ' if we ca n’t hear the scenes for ourselves , we might as well just read the summaries and not bother with the radio at all			2
is this what the @entity21 want ? ’ others took to online fan forums to air their discontent			1
one said : ‘ thousands of @entity4 fans are of an age where they neither have , now want , a computer / laptop / tablet / smartphone ( talking loo , radio toothbrush , or any other gizmo ) , so they are missing out on these plotlines			2
’ a second added : ‘ ‘ thumbs down to the @entity109 ’s producer for putting the @entity111 storyline on @entity45			1
' i 'm outraged at the way in which the ordinary listener to the @entity4 has been deprived of listening to this scene			0
' @entity116 fan ' i am regular listener of @entity4 and very angry at this after hearing it on @entity118			0
no point in listening to the @entity4 again , if one does not get all the story line			0
’ a third said : ‘ join in the protest			0

’ stand - in archers editor @entity128 , who took over from @entity4 in may , defended the scheduling decision to @entity118			0
she said : ‘ almost everybody i believe has access to digital television and @entity45 is available on there			1
' what we wanted to do was to take this lovely moment and project us into a story which will in fact be carried on both series this time			0
' so you will be hearing aspects of the story in @entity45 and in the @entity4			2
‘ those listeners who listen to both will get the whole story , but if you listen to one or the other you will hopefully get a satisfying story there as well			0
outcry : the @entity21 defended the scheduling decision to feedback ' if you do feel frustrated by that [ not hearing the scene ] there are plenty of places you can go and hear that moment			1
’ but one listener said : ‘ i ’ve got internet , but i never knew - till today - that the @entity160 stuff was anything other than tongue - in - cheek alternative episodes ! ' if i had known , i ’d have certainly set my @entity164 to record the “ extra ” progs			0
now i feel very definitely cheated out of who knows what extra plotlines that really should have been mainstream @entity4 , not @entity160 ! ! ’ now in its fifth series @entity45 airs two 15 - minute episodes every week to supplement the main programme , which is aired daily on @entity10			2
when it was created in 2011 , the @entity21 said it would run ‘ in parallel ’ with the main show and promised listeners would not miss out on vital plotlines if they did not listen to the digital series .			1

the *climax* of an affair storyline was broadcast on @entity50
fans are *unhappy* with @entity21 's decision to play scenes on @entity45
the channel is only available online , through a digital radio or television
