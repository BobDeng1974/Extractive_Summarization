the @entity1 leadership blocked @entity2 , a @entity3 candidate , from the @entity1 shortlist for the marginal seat of @entity6 the tweet about @entity8 from a senior unnamed official at @entity3 , @entity10 ’s most powerful trade union , was short and menacing : ‘ she will have to answer for her actions in due course			1
’ the threat this week was made in response to the @entity1 leadership blocking @entity2 , a @entity3 candidate , from the @entity1 shortlist for the marginal seat of @entity6			1
and the reason for their fury at the @entity20 ? the list was agreed by an ad - hoc three - strong committee chaired by @entity24			1
and that committee was given a clear instruction by @entity27 : block @entity2 at all costs			1
relations between @entity27 and the union were put under further strain when @entity32 , the retiring @entity1 mp , accused the party leadership of dirty tricks			1
she has made a formal protest to @entity37 , @entity1 ’s general secretary			1
but the heavyweight the front bench should be really worried about is @entity40 , the general secretary of @entity3 , who is enraged by the actions of @entity27 and @entity24			1
for he is the most powerful left - wing union boss since miners ’ leader @entity43			0
the snub to flame - haired @entity2 , a comprehensive school - educated @entity45 nurse , is deeply personal to @entity40 - who was married but is no longer with his wife			1
@entity40 and @entity2 - who is separated from her husband - are very close friends			1
indeed , some people in the @entity1 movement have asked - rightly or wrongly - if they are more than just friends			1
it ’s also personal for @entity40 because @entity24 is a member of @entity3 , and she presided over the blocking of their candidate			1
so why was the usually clueless @entity27 so determined to stop @entity2 ? the answer is to be found far to the north of @entity6 , in @entity59 , where @entity2 ’s candidacy in the @entity1 selection process in 2013 triggered a vote - rigging scandal so serious the police were called in by @entity27			1
the result then was virtual open warfare in the party			0
now , the animus is erupting again			0
@entity2 was cleared of any wrongdoing in an internal inquiry but withdrew from the selection race			2
in the end , the police took no action over allegations the union had packed the local party with its own supporters , and even signed people up to vote for her without their knowledge			0
but the damage was done , and her parliamentary ambitions were thwarted			0
after the @entity59 row , @entity27 - who pointedly refused to apologise to @entity2 — announced reforms to the party ’s links with the unions			1
furious : @entity40 ( pictured ) , the general secretary of @entity3 , is enraged by the actions of @entity27 and @entity24 but that attempt at firm leadership came at a price , and the response from @entity3 was swift and damaging			1
it withheld £ 1.5 million from the @entity95 , which has debts of £ 11 million			0
now , @entity27 has crossed @entity40 again and — only weeks before the general election — senior @entity3 officials are privately plotting how to wreak their revenge for the latest rebuff to @entity2 ’s parliamentary ambitions			1
@entity27 can ill - afford to make an enemy of @entity40 and @entity3 , for no other modern @entity1 leader has had to rely so heavily on one union to ensure the financial survival of the party			1
since @entity27 became leader , @entity3 has given @entity1 an astonishing £ 14.3 million			1
the union has pledged a further £ 1.5 million for the election campaign , but may now withdraw that offer			0
it could also inflict huge logistical damage on the campaign			0
in october , the union set up @entity115 ‘ to support getting @entity1 back into power to prevent the @entity118 - led @entity117 from wreaking any more damage upon the economy			2
and further attacking trade union and workers ’ rights ’			0
they are ready to launch operations in the key marginals of @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 — where @entity130 is battling @entity1 to try to overturn a 4,000 @entity118 majority — @entity132 , which the @entity133 held last time with a 2,000 majority , and @entity135 , where the @entity136 are defending a wafer - thin 300 majority from @entity1			2
the @entity3 activists will help with telephone and door - to - door canvassing , fundraising , transporting voters to polling stations and , crucially , ensuring that their fellow union members vote			2
one senior @entity1 figure said : ‘ it will just take the word from @entity40 for the activists to stay at home , and then our marginal seats operation is in big trouble			1
our membership has slumped , which means we do n’t have the foot soldiers we had before			0
‘ we need union members , which is why this argument with @entity40 could not come at a worse time			2
’ unite , whose block vote swung the leadership for @entity27 over his brother @entity162 in 2010 , has an enormous , and some @entity163 say ‘ unhealthy ’ , sway over the party			1
in 403 seats where new candidates have been chosen , 129 will be flying the @entity3 flag - more than one third of the total			2
the candidates have either worked for the union or received financial sponsorship			0
more than 50 are in key target seats where @entity1 is confident of victory in may			0
in the current @entity174 , 147 of the 257 @entity163 have received directly , or for their constituency parties , donations ranging from £ 250 to almost £ 200,000			0
@entity27 ( pictured ) can ill - afford to make an enemy of @entity40 and @entity3 , for no other modern @entity1 leader has had to rely so heavily on one union to ensure the financial survival of the party @entity3 has also handed £ 428,000 directly to @entity183 members			1
the biggest beneficiary is @entity185 , the mp for @entity186 , who has received £ 157,000 , which is more than one third of the total			0
@entity189 , significantly , is in charge of @entity27 ’s stuttering policy review			0
he has received a further £ 55,000 from other trade unions			0
@entity27 ’s private office also benefited to the tune of £ 120,000 , and there was a further £ 148,000 for his leadership campaign			2
since he became general secretary of @entity3 in january 2011 , @entity40 , according to the union ’s own data , has had 11 official meetings with the @entity201 - though it is not known how often they talk on the telephone or meet in private			1
the millions of pounds handed over by the union also come with strings			0
it ’s why @entity40 has also had meetings with @entity189 and @entity207 , the @entity208			0
@entity3 ’s paw prints can be seen on a number of policies which @entity27 has announced			1
in june 2012 , @entity40 , in a tub - thumping speech to his union , demanded a ‘ tax on the family home ’			2
eight months later , @entity27 announced a ‘ mansion tax ’ on properties worth £ 2 million or more			0
the policy has been disowned by leading @entity219 such as @entity220 , major @entity1 donors , and just about every @entity1 mp hoping to secure the party ’s nomination to be @entity225 candidate next year			2
the following summer , @entity40 called for the abolition of the spare room subsidy , or so - called bedroom tax , which is saving £ 465 million a year			2
the matter is personal for @entity40 because @entity24 ( pictured9 is a member of @entity3 , and she presided over the blocking of their candidate			1
two months later , in his party conference speech , @entity27 pledged to do just that			0
the pattern goes on : in july 2011 , @entity40 demanded a rise in corporation tax for medium and large - sized businesses			2
two years later it duly became official @entity95 policy			0
but despite the agreements on left - wing policy , the row over @entity2 threatens to overshadow @entity1 ’s election campaign			1
the quarrel is also a personal matter for @entity8			0
in 1995 , her husband @entity248 , now a @entity1 mp , ran for the leadership of the then powerful @entity250			2
@entity248 had the backing of the new @entity1 machine from @entity253 down			0
but he was heavily beaten , and the transport union was eventually absorbed into @entity3			0
one senior source said : ‘ @entity8 lobbied everyone to try to get @entity248 that job , and was bitterly disappointed when he failed			0
she has been nursing a grudge ever since			0
‘ @entity8 insisted on an all - women shortlist for @entity6 , but was adamant @entity2 was n’t on it			1
the sisterhood it seems only extends to the sort of women that @entity24 approves of , and they are clearly not certain working - class @entity45 nurses			2
’ the @entity6 @entity95 is due to choose a candidate from a six - strong shortlist on saturday , at which point the party leadership will be hoping the rancour over the latest campaign selection battle will fade away			1
but if that ominous tweet is anything to go by , the overweeningly powerful @entity3 union is already plotting its revenge .			0

@entity1 leadership blocked @entity2 from shortlist for @entity6 seat
list agreed by ad - hoc three - strong committee chaired by @entity8
given instructions by @entity27 to block the @entity3 candidate at all costs
