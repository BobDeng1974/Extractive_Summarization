by @entity0 published : 14:52 est , 28 november 2013 @entity2 : 15:09 est , 28 november 2013 this little panda cub may be only three months old but it has already got an interesting picture for the family album - even if it does look a little awkward			1
today , the cute bear received a regal hug from @entity9 @entity8 at @entity10 in @entity11			1
the cub , who has not been named yet , sat on @entity15 's lap and seemed a bit uncomfortable as she squeezed			2
but maybe it was just star - struck			0
go easy on the squeeze ... queen @entity8 cuddles the baby panda during her visit to @entity10 in @entity11 today she 's a queen ? why did n't you say so			1
here 's my star - struck look : people can log on to the zoo 's @entity27 page to choose a name for the cub you got ta sort out my identity crisis : by december 2 , the baby will have a name , from one of the five choices : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 or @entity40 this is not the first time the 75 - year - old wife of @entity44 has met the endangered animals			2
in september 2007 , she opened the refurbished panda enclosure at the zoo upon the arrival of @entity49 and @entity50 - the proud parents of the new cub			2
and in 2010 , she returned to see seven - month - olds @entity53 and @entity54 , the third time pandas had bred in @entity57 zoos at that time			0
internet users have until december 2 to vote for the name of the new baby - which was born on august 30 - via the zoo 's facebook page			1

the joint project was a goodwill gesture promised by the @entity70 government during a visit by @entity8 to @entity70 in june 2007			0
like @entity76 's @entity9 , @entity15 is a direct descendant of @entity9 @entity78 â € ” she is a great - great - great - granddaughter - and the two are cousins			0
is the giant panda actually @entity71 ? scientists now believe the origins of the giant panda lineage may lie not in @entity70 but @entity71			1
last november , two fossils , dating back 11.6million years , were unearthed in northeast @entity71 - and are thought to be of the oldest recorded ancestor of the species			0
the two sets of jaws and teeth belong to a new genus , @entity92 ( ' bears of @entity93 ' ) - in honour of paleontologist @entity93 , who had discovered other extinct pandas			0
the jaw and tooth fragments the team discovered in northeast @entity71 the details of the unique bear were described in a paper published in the open access journal @entity103 by @entity104 and colleagues from the @entity106 and the @entity107 of @entity108 , @entity71			0
