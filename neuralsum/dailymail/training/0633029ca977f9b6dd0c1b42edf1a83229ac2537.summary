it 's widely thought that @entity2 referees are quicker than their @entity4 counterparts to point to the spot - and @entity7 's @entity6 did nothing to dispel that myth with this shocking dive			2
the @entity11 champions got off to a less than ideal start after @entity13 gave the visitors the lead at the @entity16 from the penalty spot			0
but after @entity18 had equalised for @entity7 , @entity6 took matters into his own hands by chucking himself on the floor under no challenge from @entity23			0
@entity6 dives over @entity23 's leg to win a highly dubious penalty for @entity7 referee @entity26 somehow judged the ' contact ' to be worthy of a penalty referee @entity26 amazingly pointed to the spot , and @entity30 did the honours to give @entity7 the lead			1
@entity30 doubled his tally shortly afterwards to make it 3 - 1			0
but the @entity36 legend was n't finished there , bagging another two goals to complete an incredible four - goal haul			2
@entity6 in action for @entity7 against @entity40 and @entity30 , celebrating with @entity18 , made no mistake from the penalty spot			1

@entity6 dives to win a dubious penalty for @entity7
@entity30 *converts* to give the @entity11 champions a 2 - 1 lead
*ronaldo* bags another three to claim an incredible four - goal haul
another from @entity18 makes it a *comfortable* 5 - 1 *victory*
