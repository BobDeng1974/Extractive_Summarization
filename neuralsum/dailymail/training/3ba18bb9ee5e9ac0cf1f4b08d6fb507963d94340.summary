by @entity1 medical correspondent pressure on family doctors to diagnose more patients with dementia could do substantial harm , a leading gp has warned			1
they may be ‘ leaned on ’ to overdiagnose and ‘ get the numbers up ’ because there are ‘ vested interests ’ that stand to gain , dr @entity8 said			1
but this raises concerns the patient - doctor relationship is being undermined , he warned			0
getting the numbers up : league tables for dementia diagnosis could encourage some doctors to overdiagnose , a leading gp has warned in the @entity20 ( photo posed by models ) health secretary @entity23 has prioritised increasing dementia diagnosis rates in those patients who do n’t have obvious symptoms			1
he believes gps are reluctant to carry out tests because there is no effective cure			2
but this has raised fears that unnecessary diagnoses will be made for fear of losing funding			0
mr @entity23 has endorsed new targets for diagnosis rates of @entity38 ’s and other forms of the disease			2
in november , he published a ‘ dementia map ’ of rates for different clinical commissioning groups ( @entity44 )			0
targets : @entity23 is prioritising detection levels , but there could be unforeseen consequences but dr @entity8 said the video accompanying the website features mr @entity23 ‘ lambasting the laggards for poor performance ’			1
as a result @entity54 are piling on the pressure on @entity27 to raise dementia diagnosis rates ‘ with financial strings attached ’ , while ‘ leaning on you heavily to make any diagnosis to get the numbers up ’ , he claimed			2
at least one @entity44 has told its gps the area will lose money if they do n’t increase rates , dr @entity8 added			1
and he warned that ‘ naming and shaming ’ makes the worst performers desperate to get off the bottom of the league table and so may unnecessarily ‘ upgrade ’ the diagnosis to dementia			1
dr @entity8 , from @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , is among growing medical opposition to the strategy			1
he said there was deep concern that the patient - doctor relationship was being undermined			0
the setting of target rates for the diagnosis of any condition is unprecedented , says dr @entity8 , in a personal view in the @entity20			1
he said : ‘ dementia is big business and there are many vested interests that stand to benefit from a rise in the number of diagnoses			0
’ one in three older people has some form of minor cognitive impairment , which can be picked up in tests but may never lead to full - blown dementia			2
meanwhile , figures used to estimate how many diagnoses each practice should make are often wrong and fail to take into account local circumstances , such as dementia care homes in the area , dr @entity8 added			1
and he warned : ‘ working towards targets can lead to perverse behaviours and outcomes , because the needs of patients are secondary to the requirement to fulfil quotas			2
’ in @entity111 , health services will miss out on extra money if they miss diagnosis targets ( file photo ) the @entity115 said in june 2010 that screening for @entity38 ‘ should not be offered ’ because there was insufficient evidence of the benefits			0
@entity54 , which comprise groups of @entity27 collectively responsible for commissioning local services , can attract a quality premium payment as a reward for improving a range services			0
@entity44 has chosen the dementia rate target as one of the qualifying measures			0
if they miss it they will lose out on extra money for the area			0
dr @entity8 said : ‘ the idea that doctors should be motivated by self interest , such as personal or corporate gain , is abhorrent			1
’ the @entity137 said in 2011 there were 250,000 dementia patients registered by @entity27			0
a @entity142 spokesman said : ‘ a timely diagnosis can make a significant difference to a person ’s quality of life			0
' we would always expect doctors to act in the best interests of their patients , to assess them appropriately when they show the signs of dementia , and refer them to a specialist for diagnosis			2

leading gp dr @entity8 , from @entity72 , @entity73 , *voiced* view in @entity20
@entity23 has said it is important to increase diagnosis and detection
dr @entity8 : gps with few cases will be desperate to escape a low ranking
he argues ' naming and shaming ' could lead doctors to ' up the numbers '
