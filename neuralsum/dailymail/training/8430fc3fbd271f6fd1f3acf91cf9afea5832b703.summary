the video captures the moment when the tomb explodes , showering the surrounding area with rubble and dust			0
one of the devastated tombstones belonged to the @entity42 ( @entity43 in @entity44 ) and was revered by @entity45 and @entity46 alike , according to @entity15 authorities			1
the prophet , who is the central figure in the @entity50 's @entity6 , is best known for being swallowed by a fish or a whale , depending on translation			0
the attack is the latest in the @entity4 's violent rampage across @entity15			1
earlier this week , a series of images emerged showing the destruction of almost a dozen @entity59 and @entity61 religious shrines in @entity14 , @entity15 's second largest city , and the town of @entity63 , which is also currently under @entity4 control			1
armed : the rebels , who are members of the @entity67 terror group , were filmed attacking centuries - old graves in the north - west city of @entity14 in @entity71 province			1
above , an @entity4 militant vandalises a tombstone smash : donning balaclavas and black coats , the rebels swung sledgehammers into the green tombstones speaking of the latest attack , @entity71 official @entity81 , told @entity83 : ' the elements of @entity4 [ have ] controlled the mosque of the @entity43 in @entity14 since they invaded the city			1
' ' [ they ] engaged in the process of tampering with the contents of the @entity90			0
it is still held by them until now			0
' the shrine of the @entity94 ( @entity95 ) was also destroyed by rebels , according to reports			2
revered tomb : one of the devastated tombstones belonged to the @entity42 ( @entity43 in @entity44 ) and was revered by @entity45 and @entity46 alike , authorities said			1
another belonged to the @entity94 ( @entity95 ) it comes as more than 50 bodies have been discovered by @entity15 authorities in an agricultural area outside the city of @entity107 , just south of @entity108 , today			1
military spokesman brigadier general @entity109 said most of the 53 bodies were found blindfolded with their hands bound and several gunshot wounds			1
the grisly discovery in @entity107 , a predominantly @entity59 city around 60 miles south of @entity108 , has raised concerns over a possible sectarian killing amid the battle against a @entity61 insurgency			1
brig gen @entity119 said an investigation was underway to determine the identities of the dead , as well as the circumstances of the killings			1
isis have been attacking a host of historical sites across @entity15 as part of their terror campaign the dead were all men between the ages of 25 and 40 , and it appeared they had been killed a few days earlier and then dumped in the remote area , said a local police officer and a medical official			2
they officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media			0
a lightning sweep by the insurgents over much of northern and western @entity15 in the past month has dramatically hiked tensions between the @entity59 majority and @entity61 minority			1
at the same time , splits have grown between the @entity59 - led government in @entity108 and the @entity149 autonomic region in the north			2
destroyed : the photographs were posted on a website which frequently carries official statements from the @entity67 extremist group prime minister @entity155 today accused the @entity149 zone of being a haven for the extremists and other @entity61 insurgents			0
the claims are likely to further strain @entity108 's ties with @entity162 , whose fighters have been battling the militant advance			2
mr @entity155 lashed out at the @entity162 in his weekly televised statement , saying ' everything that has been changed on the ground must be returned ' - a reference to disputed territory @entity149 fighters have taken			0
he went a step further , saying : ' we ca n't stay silent over @entity173 being a headquarters for @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and the terrorists			0
' @entity175 is the acronym in @entity44 for the @entity180 , often used as a pejorative by its opponents , while the @entity176 was the party of former dictator @entity182			0
but mr @entity155 provided no evidence to back up his claims , which are sure to be rejected by @entity149 leaders in @entity173			0
evidence on the ground also contradicts his allegations			0
while the motives in this case remain unclear , such killings hark back to the worst days of @entity15 's sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007			2
at that time , with a @entity61 insurgency raging , @entity59 militias and @entity61 militant groups were notorious for killings of members of the other sect			2
bodies were frequently dumped by roads , in empty lots , ditches and canals			2
as the levels of violence dropped over time , such discoveries became rare			0
but sectarian tensions have soared once more and authorities have once again begun to find unidentified bodies since the @entity61 militant offensive swept across much of northern and western @entity15			1
the militant surge is led by the @entity67 extremist group , but other @entity61 insurgents have joined , feeding off anger in their minority community against the @entity59 - led government			0
prime minister : @entity155 today accused the @entity149 autonomic region in the north of being a haven for the extremists and @entity61 insurgents			2
he said : ' everything that has been changed on the ground must be returned ' on the other side , @entity59 militias have rallied around mr @entity155 's government to fight back against the militant advance			0
in the far north , @entity162 have taken advantage of the mayhem to seize disputed territory - including the city of @entity233 , a major oil centre - and move closer to a long - held dream of their own state			2
@entity149 fighters say they only want to protect the areas from @entity61 militants			2
many of the areas have significant @entity149 populations that they have demanded for years be incorporated into their territory			0
these moves have infuriated mr @entity155 , who is under pressure from opponents as well as former allies to step down			0
the photographs of the destroyed churches and mosques that emerged last week were posted on a website which frequently carries official statements from @entity4			2
some of them showed bulldozers plowing through walls , while others featured buildings being demolished by explosives in a cloud of smoke and rubble			0
three @entity61 clerics were also killed by @entity4 gunmen in @entity14 after calling on locals to reject the terror group and refusing to leave the city , authorities said			1
the victims were @entity269 , 43 , @entity270 , 39 , and 48 - year - old @entity271			0
today , archbishops from @entity108 , @entity14 and @entity233 said the violence in @entity15 is hastening the end of nearly 2,000 years of @entity275 there as the few remaining faithful flee @entity67 militants			1
war and sectarian conflict have shrunk @entity15 's @entity46 population to about 400,000 from 1.5million before the @entity281 - led invasion in 2003 , they said on a visit to @entity283 seeking @entity284 help to protect their flocks			1
and now , even those who stayed are leaving for @entity288 , @entity289 and western @entity290 , they claimed			0
the three - @entity291 , @entity292 of @entity293 and @entity233 's @entity295 archbishop @entity294 - are all @entity296 whose churches have their own traditional liturgy but are loyal to the pope in @entity300			0
' the next days will be very bad			0
if the situation does not change , @entity46 will be left with just a symbolic presence in @entity15 , ' said @entity291 , who is based in @entity108 ' if they leave , their history is finished			1
' more than 50 bodies have been discovered by @entity15 authorities in an agricultural area outside the city of @entity107 , just south of @entity108 , today			1
