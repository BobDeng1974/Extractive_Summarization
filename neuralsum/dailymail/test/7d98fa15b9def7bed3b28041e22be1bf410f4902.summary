runner : a @entity1 by @entity2 waiting nervously at the starting line of her first 155 km race around @entity6 , 29 - year - old @entity2 looked down at her holey long johns , clumpy trail shoes and the poorly fitting rucksack she had borrowed , then up at the elite @entity11 kit of her fellow competitors			1
she had entered the 2005 @entity13 ( @entity14 ) on a whim — but now , the reality of the challenge ahead began to sink in			1
she would be covering almost the same distance as that between her birthplace in the @entity22 suburbs and @entity23 , where she was studying for a phd in environmental science			2
and her slight , 5 ft 4 in body would have to keep lifting those heavy shoes through 8,500m of ascent and descent — equivalent to climbing from sea level to the summit of @entity32 and back			2
some 26 hours , 51 minutes and 51 seconds later , @entity2 surprised herself , and everyone else , by becoming the first woman to cross the dark , wet , @entity36 finish line that year , coming 24th overall			1
@entity2 entered the 2005 @entity13 ( pictured ) on a whim and she 's since gone on to become @entity40 ’s most distinctive female ‘ ultra runner ’ she would go on to become @entity40 ’s most distinctive female ‘ ultra runner ’ , coming first in the @entity14 five times , taking gold in the women ’s 100km @entity43 in @entity44 in 2006 , setting a new women ’s world record for 24 hours on the road in the 2011 @entity48 and a new course record at the sunbaked 246 km @entity50 in 2012			1
but @entity2 ’s inspirational memoir does not focus on the figures			1
she ’s more interested in why she is able to push herself beyond normal limits , and how running makes her feel			2
her book is strong on @entity58 philosophy and the peace that comes with living fully in the now			0
raised in @entity60 , @entity22 , @entity2 says she always felt a profound connection to nature			1
she became a vegetarian aged five , and knew her future lay in the mountains after her first skiing trip to @entity66 when she was six			0
only a few years later , frustrated by the queue for the cable cars , she threw her skis over her shoulders and beat her family back down the mountain			0
when you ask artists and musicians why they chose their paths , they will often reply that all children love to draw and sing : they just refused to stop			0
@entity2 feels the same about running			1
studying at @entity79 and later working for the @entity80 , she struggled with the hours at her desk and confined on boats			0
she ran at weekends and after work , clocking an average time in the @entity85 and later winning a race across the fells			0
but after that first @entity14 triumph , @entity2 knew she had found her calling and she renounced the world of employment			1
sponsorship from @entity93 helped fund her travel to races around the world			0
she owns few possessions , travelling with just clothes , shoes and a laptop			0
though running makes @entity2 feel ‘ beautifully empowered ’ , it has left her with ‘ unbeautiful ’ feet			1
as she writes ( from her temporary home in the @entity104 ) , she faces the possibility of never running again			0
six stress fractures to the bones of her legs and feet may end her career			0
but she ends by quoting @entity110 , who believed that : ‘ life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well - preserved body , but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke , thoroughly used up , totally worn out and loudly proclaiming : “ wow ! what a ride ! ” ’			2

@entity2 entered the 2005 @entity13 ( @entity14 ) on a whim
