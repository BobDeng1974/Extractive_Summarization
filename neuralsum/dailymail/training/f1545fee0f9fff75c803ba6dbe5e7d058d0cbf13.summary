by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 it 's @entity4 , but not as we know it			1
dynamic , inventive and exuberant , @entity7 ’s new - look team have ripped up their overused ‘ how to win ’ manual and begun work on a new book			1
with @entity11 as the author , the latest chapter in @entity4 ’s meteoric rise looks sure to make compelling reading			1
the @entity17 club lived up to their billing as early - season title favourites with a tantalising display of attacking football in monday ’s 3 - 1 win at @entity23			1
it was breathtaking at times — @entity26 ’s goal alone was worth the entrance money			0
we wondered if @entity11 could still cut it in @entity53			1
in that moment , we got the answer			0
his two debut assists were merely the icing on the cake , though			0
it was the way he dictated @entity4 ’s play and tempo that caught the eye			1
of course , his nine years at @entity64 helped ; there will be no settling in period for him			1
his sixth sense of when to inject pace into @entity4 ’s passing or take the foot off the gas was all too apparent at @entity72			2
you just wonder what @entity74 , or even @entity75 , were thinking when watching the @entity78 ’s display			0
and in @entity79 , @entity11 has a midfield monster of a partner who can provide him with the platform to cause destruction			1
beauty : @entity11 ' exquisite passing orchestrated play from midfield ... and the @entity88 : @entity79 offered a perfect foil for @entity11 with his tough tackling @entity7 said : ‘ @entity11 and @entity79 controlled the game , the intensity of the game , they were choosing how to play ; when to increase pace and decrease pace			1
‘ last season we could n’t control the game in the way we controlled it today			0
@entity97 was our first choice for that position			0
i know clearly the player he is because we have spent so many years in the same league , here in @entity53 , then he moved to @entity108			0
‘ he ’s giving exactly what we need , that stability , that quick thinking in midfield , the right intensity of the game			0
he brings other people in the same direction			0
’ striker light : @entity7 did not select a true no 9 in his first away game last season @entity49 engineering : @entity26 scored the goal of the night after a through ball from @entity11 the counter-argument , of course , is that this was the first game of the season , against a newly - promoted team			1
and , yes , that should be taken into account			0
but the signs are ominous for the rest of the @entity131			2
remember that attacking football and @entity4 have n’t always gone hand in hand			2
too often they have relied on sheer power to get them over the line			0
indeed , it was only this time last year when @entity7 took his side to @entity141 and started the game without a recognised striker			1
now , 12 months on , and @entity7 ’s team look transformed			2
but that ’s not to say @entity4 have forgotten how to rough it			2
missing link : @entity108 international @entity29 is the striker that @entity4 were missing last season @entity149 and @entity79 controlled the game - @entity7 @entity29 scored on his debut against @entity153 ’s side but , perhaps , more importantly showed an appetite for a fight			1
@entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity79 will not pull punches either			2
in many ways , it ’s @entity162 ’s dream			0
a team with the beauty of @entity38 ’s tiki - taka and the brute force of the 1980s @entity43			1
mix it all together and you could have this season ’s title winners			0

@entity7 has created a new - look side at @entity4 this season
the @entity40 have the creativity of @entity38 and the physicality of @entity43
@entity4 were *exceptional* in opening @entity131 3 - 1 *defeat* of @entity23
former @entity64 midfielder @entity11 orchestrated play from midfield
@entity79 provided the ideal foil with his tough tackling
@entity29 is the striker that @entity4 *sorely* missed last season
