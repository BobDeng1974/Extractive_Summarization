‘ this essential structural work needed to be completed whoever moved in			2
the last major works in the apartment took place around the time that princess @entity12 and @entity52 moved in more than 50 years ago			1
the cost of interior decorating and furnishing of course falls to the @entity57 privately			0
’ the spokesman also stressed that occupied royal palaces are held in trust for the nation , so @entity9 and @entity10 do not own the apartment , nor can they or the @entity57 sell it			2
