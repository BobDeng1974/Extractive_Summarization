by @entity0 most excitable young pups would n't wait for an invite before making themselves at home on a patch of luscious green grass			0
but when these nine beagles were given free rein in a beautiful garden , they had no idea what to with themselves			0
these adorably young pups had spent their entire lives locked away in in the confines of a laboratory in @entity17 , where they were heartlessly used as test subjects - and never once allowed to run around or play			1
in an amazing video which recorded the moment , volunteers from the @entity35 are seen carefully releasing the puppies into the @entity26 garden - where they are given their very first taste of freedom			1
with no experience of the outside world , the dogs are seen tentatively making their way across the grass , dazzled by their new surroundings			0
the footage shows four of the puppies looking so scared that they even start looking for a spot to hide			2
the puppies are seen cowering behind bushes , trees and even an old wooden pen			0
but the footage , filmed in a garden in @entity26 , shows the puppies slowly starting to embrace their new - found freedom			2
one of the beagles strides excitedly through the grass after he is released from the laboratory in @entity17 for the first time by volunteers from the @entity35 the puppies , who have had no contact with the outside world since they were born , jumped up to greet one another as they ran around the garden within minutes , the dogs have come together in solidarity , frantically wagging their tails as they jump up to greet one another			1
the incredible footage also shows one of the volunteers giving names to the dogs for the first time			2
previously know by just a number , the hounds were named after members of the @entity77 and other entertainers , including @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
the puppies spent their lives in cages ( left ) and were understandably apprehensive when they were taken by volunteers out into the fresh air ( right ) after spending some time in the garden , the beagles started tucking into bowls of water and food under the guidance of the volunteers @entity80 - named after @entity95 - is the first to be released , apprehensively looking around him as the volunteer places him onto the grass			1
meanwhile inquisitive @entity81 - named after @entity81 - snuck under the pool fence so he could take a quick dip in the pool			0
