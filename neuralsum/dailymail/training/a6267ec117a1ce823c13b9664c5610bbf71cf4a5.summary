after weeks of speculation , sir @entity0 and @entity1 have finally revealed how their son @entity3 was conceived			1
while the pair had previously remained silent on which of them was the biological father , @entity1 has now confirmed that he and @entity0 ' both contributed ' to the conception of @entity3 , who was born to a surrogate mother on christmas day last year			1
as the pair undertook a surrogacy program in @entity17 , the mixing of their semen specimens was allowed - a process which is currently banned in the @entity19 - before being used to fertilise a previously chosen egg			1
proud parents : sir @entity0 and @entity1 have spoken of their love for new baby son @entity3 in @entity24 magazine when asked which of them is @entity3 's biological father , @entity1 explained : ' we both contributed			1
for the time being we do n't have a clue			1
we look at him every day and at the moment he has @entity0 's nose and my hands			1
' neither of us care			1
the important thing is that he 's healthy and happy and loved			1
' on @entity3 's birth certificate , @entity0 was registered as the boy 's father while @entity1 was named under the mother category in computer documents			1
initially - normally on computer documentation - a ‘ father ’ and ‘ mother ’ are listed			1
however , in ‘ gay dad ’ surrogacy cases , when the actual certificate is produced , the couple can apply to have it re-issued as @entity49			1
during their interview and photoshoot in @entity54 , both @entity0 and @entity1 beam with happiness as they introduce little @entity58 @entity57 to the world			1
happy and content : the pair looked excited about the new addition to their family as they went for lunch in @entity67 last week the 63 - year - old singer and 48 - year - old @entity1 are seen beaming as they hold @entity3 , dressed in a white top and denim dungarees , on the cover of ok ! publication			2
and @entity0 has revealed he is thoroughly enjoying fatherhood , and ca n't wait to ' lavish his love ' on his new son			2
he said : ' there just are n't proper words to describe that feeling			2
it was just ... we have a son			2
' ' i 'm ready to have a child and lavish my love on our son and not spoil him but be there for him and advise him			2
' we do n't want to spoil him materially , although he 's already been spoiled rotten by people buying him stuff ! we just want to give him some wisdom			2
' @entity0 also said he and @entity1 are both determined to be as ' hands on ' as possible with @entity3			0
he added : ' i feed him			0
i mean , it 's hands on ! we are on nappy patrol			0
' @entity0 and @entity1 revealed in the accompanying interview in ok ! magazine that they were present for the @entity3 's birth			0
recalling the happy day , @entity0 said : ' suddenly , at 2.15am on christmas day , we were woken up			0
they said , " quickly ! the baby 's coming ! ' we went in and stood behind the bed			0
then the top of the head came out and @entity1 said , " my @entity109 , there 's the head ! " ' then he shot out like a rocket basically - so much so that the obstetrician sort of caught him ! it was so dramatic and exciting , we did n't have time to get emotional			0
like there he was , talk about fast ! ' @entity1 also said the couple have n't ruled out having more children in the future , adding : ' this is a big change in our life			0
we have to see how we cope and adapt with one child before we even consider a second			0
' the @entity124 singer added that while the couple now have their own son , they will never give up on @entity129 orphans @entity130 , two , and his brother @entity131 , four , who they met when they visited an orphanage in 2009			0
while their plans to adopt the children were thwarted by the country not recognising same sex marriages , @entity0 insists he will continue providing emotional and financial support for @entity130 and @entity131			0
@entity0 and @entity1 are donating all fees received from the interview and pictures of @entity3 to charity .			0

they contributed equally to ' mixing process ' banned in @entity19
