by @entity0 published : 13:44 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 02:53 est , 5 july 2013 it has been credited with sharpening women 's fashion sense and promoting the single lifestyle			2
but the tv series @entity6 has had another unexpected outcome - helping to rid the world of pubic lice			1
there has been a huge decline in recent years in the number of cases of lice , with clinicians claiming that the rising popularity of @entity17 or @entity19 - style bikini waxes is the cause			1
doctors from the @entity22 of @entity23 ( @entity24 ) believe they can link the lice decrease with the airing of an episode of @entity6 in 2000 which sparked the waxing trend			1
trend setter : @entity6 , starring from left @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , has been credited with sparking the waxing trend , resulting in a huge decline in the number of pubic lice cases the episode shows several of the main characters - @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 - undergoing a wax where all the hair is removed			1
the pubic louse has infested humans for thousands of years , with archaeologists discovering specimens in the @entity49 as far back as the 1st century @entity50			0
the pubic louse evolved from its ancestor , the gorilla louse , about 3.3 million years ago and adapted to live in areas on the human body with a similar density of hair to that of the gorilla			0
unfortunately this was a costly mistake , as a mere 3.3 million years later the international success of ‘ @entity6 ’ has led to an unprecedented removal of this very hair			1
the increase of @entity19 or @entity17 waxing is believed to have caused a decrease in the cases of lice which are now on the threshold of going extinct a @entity49 study showed a fourfold increase in its incidence , from 0.8 per cent in 1954 to 3.2 per cent in 1964 , which may have been due to increased sexual freedom			1
however , from 1997 to 2003 a further @entity49 study revealed a steep reduction in prevalence from about 0.41 per cent to 0.17 per cent			1
the research due to be presented at the @entity80 next week			0
similar observations have also been reported from sexual health specialists in @entity83			0
@entity85 's main sexual health clinic has n't treated a woman with pubic lice since 2008 while male cases have fallen 80 per cent from about 100 a decade ago			2
a decrease in sexual activity could not have accounted for this , as the prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases has increased			2
dr @entity94 , one of the authors of the presentation , said : ' pubic hair removal has been practised by humans for thousands of years , by cultures from all over the world , including the @entity101			0
' however , until recently , with the rise of truly global mass media , pubic lice have been able to weather changing cultural attitudes to body hair			2
' what we have seen at work is the law of unintended consequences , in popularising hair removal @entity112 and co have contributed to ridding humanity of pest that had plagued humans for millions of years			0
sadly there is n’t an emmy for that			0
' before giving all the plaudits to the writers of ‘ @entity6 ’ it ’s worth considering that other factors for the decline in pubic lice numbers could include the reluctance of patients to seek medical attention leading to self - treatment with over-the - counter insecticidal treatments , therefore causing a decline in recorded numbers			1
the research is due to be released at the @entity135 in @entity136 next week			0
influential : the show featured several characters having @entity19 or @entity17 waxes which is believed to have encouraged viewers to follow suit			0

prevalence of lice dropped from 0.41 **%** to 0.17 **%** between 1997 to 2003
clinicians believe the huge decline is a result of an increase in bikini waxing
@entity22 of @entity23 believe an episode of @entity6 aired in 2000 sparked the waxing trend
