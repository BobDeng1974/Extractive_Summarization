the city of @entity2 's police department is set to be overhauled after federal investigators concluded that officers use excessive and unnecessary force far too often and have endangered the public and their fellow officers with their recklessness			1
a two - year investigation by the @entity10 , released on thursday , found that @entity2 police use guns , @entity13 , ' impact weapons , ' pepper spray and their fists in excess , unnecessarily or in retaliation			1
in some cases unnecessary force was ' in violation of the @entity22 of the @entity23 , ' claimed the report			1
@entity26 attorney general @entity25 , right , appeared at a news conference thursday to announce the findings along with @entity2 police chief @entity29 , left , and @entity2 mayor @entity31 , center officers also use excessive force on those ' who are mentally ill or in crisis , ' the @entity10 said			1
accountability , or the lack thereof , was a reoccurring theme of the report			0
of the period reviewed , 2010 - 2013 , the investigation found that officers were suspended on only six occasions for improper use of force			1
' discipline is so rare that no more than 51 officers out of a sworn force of 1,500 were disciplined in any fashion in connection with a use of force incident over a three - and - a half - year period , ' the report said			1
more disturbing was an admission by investigators carrying out reports into the use of deadly force that they always sought to show the officer involved in the best possible light			1
' deeply troubling to us was that some of the specially trained investigators who are charged with conducting unbiased reviews of officers ' use of deadly force admitted to us that they conduct their investigations with the goal of casting the accused officer in the most positive light possible , ' said the report			1
last week , hundreds of people blocked a @entity2 freeway at rush hour to protest those killings and the fatal shooting of @entity75 , a black 12 - year - old boy , by a white officer outside a @entity2 recreation center @entity2 mayor @entity31 and the @entity10 signed an agreement on thursday that said both sides will work toward the appointment of a court - appointed monitor to oversee reform			1
' we understand the progress we seek will not come over night , ' attorney general @entity25 said at a press conference to announce the findings			0
the @entity10 found a systemic pattern of reckless and inappropriate use of force by officers and cited concerns about search - and - seizure practices			1
@entity31 was among those who asked the department to conduct the inquiry			0
it also said officers frequently violated people 's civil rights because of faulty tactics , inadequate training and a lack of supervision and accountability			0
officers ' excessive use of force has created deep mistrust in @entity2 , especially in the black community , the report concluded			2
' we saw too many incidents in which officers accidentally shot someone either because they fired their guns accidentally or because they shot the wrong person , ' the report said			0
in november 2012 police officers fired 137 shots into a car killing 43 - year - old driver @entity122 , left , and 30 - year - old passenger @entity123 in the parking lot of a suburban middle school the federal investigation was prompted by several highly publicized police encounters , chiefly the deaths of two unarmed people who were fatally wounded when police officers fired 137 shots into their car at the end of a high - speed pursuit in november 2012			1
in that incident , the @entity10 said , police began chasing @entity122 and passenger @entity123 after officers and witnesses thought they heard a gunshot coming from their car as they drove by a court building			2
the report said it now appears that what they heard was the car backfiring			0
more than 100 officers engaged in a chase of the two unarmed suspects in violation of division policy			0
after a 25 - minute chase that reached speeds of more than 100 mph and ended in an @entity154 school parking lot , 13 officers fired 137 rounds hitting @entity122 and @entity29 more than 20 times each , the report said			0
' the officers , who were firing on the car from all sides , reported believing that they were being fired at by the suspects			0
it now appears that those shots were being fired by fellow officers , ' the @entity10 wrote			2
a two - year investigation by the @entity10 , released on thursday , found that @entity2 police use guns , @entity13 , ' impact weapons , ' pepper spray and their fists in excess , unnecessarily or in retaliation the report comes amid inflamed tensions between police and residents in several cities where white officers have killed young blacks , including in @entity179 and @entity180 , @entity181			1
all those events have raised urgent national questions about the sense of trust between police and communities , @entity25 said			0
last week , hundreds of people blocked a @entity2 freeway at rush hour to protest those killings and the fatal shooting of @entity75 , a black 12 - year - old boy , by a white officer outside a @entity2 recreation center			1
@entity2 police chief @entity29 has defended @entity75 's shooting , saying he reached for an air pistol that was ' indistinguishable from a real firearm			2
' the @entity10 has opened civil rights investigations into the practices of some 20 police departments in the past five years , and it is reviewing both the @entity180 police department and the chokehold death of @entity205 , an unarmed black man in @entity179			2
it 's also currently enforcing more than a dozen agreements to overhaul police department practices nationwide			0
the report comes amid inflamed tensions between police and residents in several cities where white officers have killed young blacks , including in @entity179 and @entity180 , @entity181 , ( pictured above ) ' we have seen in city after city where we have engaged that meaningful change is possible , ' @entity25 said			0
@entity2 and the @entity10 will begin negotiating an agreement that will be submitted to a federal judge outlining the scope of reforms , to include the appointment of an independent monitor			2
a joint statement signed by city and federal officials said @entity2 's mayor , safety director and police chief ' will always retain full authority ' to run the police department			0
@entity31 said on thursday that the city disagreed with some of the facts and conclusion in the report , but he did not dispute the overall findings			0
the report notes that the @entity10 first looked at @entity2 officers ' use of deadly force in 2002 and that an agreement was reached two years later on how such policies would be changed			1
there was no court order or independent monitor assigned then			0
the @entity10 began its investigation in march 2013 and reviewed nearly 600 use - of - force incidents - both lethal and not - that occurred between 2010 and 2013			1
the report notes that @entity2 police officials did not provide many of the documents sought by federal investigators			2
@entity2 police chief @entity29 said the details of the 58 - page report were difficult to hear			2
' people of this city need to know we will work to make the police department better , ' he said .			0
