by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor millionaire lingerie boss @entity2 has called for inheritance tax to be axed to stop the government spending her money when she dies			2
the mother - of - three , who owns the £ 50million @entity7 push up bra firm , said the tax on money and property left to loved ones was ‘ unfair and should be abolished ’			1
the plea came after @entity14 hinted the @entity16 party manifesto at the next election will exempt all estates worth up to £ 1million			1
under current rules a single person can leave £ 325,000 tax - free , while couples have a joint threshold of £ 650,000			1
but mrs @entity2 , who divorced last year , called for an end to death taxes , insisting she had already paid tax on her earnings in life			1
‘ i work really hard every single day - like a lot of people - for my children and for my children ’s future , ’ she told @entity38 2 ’s @entity39			1
‘ i want them to have that little nest for their future and for their children , and i do n't see why i , others should work extremely hard , pay your tax and then when you die it is like a double whammy			1
‘ @entity58 prices are rising which means that there is a lot more people who have to pay inheritance tax			2
it is unfair and should be abolished			1
‘ i certainly do n’t want the government deciding what to do with my money when i am dead			2
’ mrs @entity2 said her earings were taxed in lfie and should not be taxed again in death last year mrs @entity2 wrested control of her business empire from the hands of her former husband @entity74 after agreeing to buy his share for an estimated £ 24million			1
she said she had already written her will , which would see her wealth passed to her children in stages			1
‘ i am bringing my children up with that hardworking , want to succeed background			1
my kids do n’t suddenly get the case			2
my kids get it at stages in life , hopefully they went get it until late in life and i will live forever			1
‘ that ’s what i want to do			2
i want to work hard in order to make my children ’s future a bit easier in order that they have got that nest , that they are protected			1
‘ i have three children			1
i am a single parent and i do n’t want my kids struggling			0
i also do n’t want them to be spoilt			0
‘ i think i should decide what i do with my money			0
i have already got my will there for my children and to give part of it to charity and everything else			1
‘ the government should not be taxing me again when i have already paid tax for it			0
‘ it is unfair and there is a lot more people who have to pay inheritance tax now because house prices are rising and you pay it on your whole estate			2
’ some people are forced to sell the family home when one member dies to pay the inheritance tax bill , she said			0
‘ i have heard some horror stories where someone has lived in the family home for 20 - 25 years and they have to actually move out of the family home to pay the tax			0
’ many parents also want to provide their children with a nest egg for big life expenses , like going to university			1
mrs @entity2 went on : ‘ if the worst scenario happens sometime they pay the tax on the estate , they can not even afford to go to university			0
they can not afford to live the life that people with lots of money do			2
’ she was appearing on the programme with musician and businessman @entity141 , the son of magnate @entity142 who is worth an estimated $ 58billion			0
@entity143 insisted he had made his own way in life without relying on his father ’s wealth / ‘ it comes down to the question of how much is enough			2
that is why i definitely agree with my father and have experienced it myself			0
i believe self - respect comes from earning its own reward , ’ he told the programme			0
‘ i am very proud of the world i have built myself			0
i think if i lived off my father ’s wealth or do in the future i am going to frankly wonder if i could have done it myself			0
’ however his argument was undermined when he admitted that as a young man he had been given shares in his father ’s firm worth $ 250,000 in today ’s money			0
@entity141 , son of multibillionaire tycoon @entity142 , said he had built his own life but admitted receiving shares from his father as a young man this week mr @entity14 suggested the @entity171 could go further to target older voters , with an increase in the inheritance tax threshold planned for the manifesto			1
before the 2010 election the @entity16 promised to raise it to £ 1million , freeing most families from paying the duty at all			1
but the idea was a victim of the power - sharing talks with the @entity183 and never became coalition policy			0
mr @entity14 insisted the idea would be resurrected ahead of the 2015 election			1
prime minister @entity14 said he wanted to increase the amount of money people can leave loved ones without being hit by inheritance tax speaking to @entity193 members in @entity194 , near @entity195 , @entity196 , the prime minister said : ‘ would i like to go further in future ? yes , i would			1
‘ i believe in people being able to pass money down through the generations and pass things on to their children			2
i think you build a stronger society			0
’ he added : ‘ inheritance tax should only be paid for by the rich			0
it should n't be paid for by people who have worked hard and saved , and bought a family house in , say , @entity194			0
‘ so the ambition is still there and i would like to go further			0
it 's better than it was , but it did n't make it into the coalition agreement			0
it 's something we will have to address in our manifesto			0
