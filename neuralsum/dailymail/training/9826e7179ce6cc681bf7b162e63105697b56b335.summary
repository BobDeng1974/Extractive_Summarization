@entity0 was last night accused of ‘ denigrating marriage ’ by planning a show that will see couples marry on their first meeting			1
gone will be all the romance , planning and excitement of a traditional wedding , as a panel of tv experts play match - maker to six singletons			2
the series , called married at @entity14 , will choose three men and three women to tie the knot , seeking to answer questions about how and why people fall in love			2
unusual weddings : six singletons are going to be introduced at the altar and immediately married off on tv but critics have condemned the show , in which couples will meet for the first time at the altar , as a ‘ cheap publicity stunt ’ similar to ‘ getting married at 3am in @entity30 ’			1
participants will enter into legally binding marriages in front of their family and friends before setting about life as a newlywed couple , all the while followed by tv cameras			1
did n't last : @entity40 and @entity41 the programme , planned for next spring , copies a similar experiment on @entity45 in which only one of the three couples decided to stay married after the show			1
a former @entity51 attempt failed in 1999 , when two strangers were matched up by @entity54 radio station @entity53 , agreeing to marry in order to win prizes			0
former model @entity41 , 23 , wed sales manager @entity40 , 28 , on air – but the pair split just three months later and miss @entity41 went on to marry daytime tv presenter @entity59 , who had a show on @entity53 at the time			0
married at @entity14 will see the six people , selected from a pool of 200 , put their love lives in the hands of psychologists , anthropologists and theology experts , who will analyse their values , looks and personalities to make matches			0
brides and grooms will first meet at their weddings , having never before set eyes on one another			0
the show will then follow each couple for six weeks , after which they will decide whether to stay together or go their separate ways			0
last night , @entity82 , from the @entity81 , slammed the programme as a ‘ terrible idea ’ , saying : ‘ it ’s disappointing that tv producers seem to be in this constant race to the bottom , and this is just another idea that denigrates marriage			0
new show : the programme on @entity0 ( whose @entity94 base is pictured ) is based on a successful @entity97 programme and will see a pool of 200 people reduced to six singles willing to say ' i do ' - without having met clearly a marriage contracted between two people who barely know each other , who are doing it solely for the sake of a tv programme , is not showing proper respect for the institution			1
‘ marriage is meant to be for life and contracting a marriage as part of a tv show ranks somewhere alongside getting married at 3am in vegas ... it ’s horrible for broadcasters to be experimenting with people ’s lives in this way			2
’ wedding planner @entity120 said : ‘ the idea of simply plucking two people off the street and getting married without meeting is bizarre			0
marriage should be between two people who love each other unconditionally , who know each other inside out and wish to make that life - long commitment			1
’ @entity0 ’s chief creative officer @entity129 said she hoped to ‘ take on @entity51 ’s reputation as the divorce capital of @entity132 ’			0
marriage in the @entity51 is at an all - time low , with 15.7million adults not in a romantic relationship			2
a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ rather than undermining the importance of marriage this is an acknowledgment that statistically the institution of marriage has a vital role to play in creating an environment where committed and long - lasting relationships can develop			1

six singletons will be introduced at the altar and immediately married off
@entity0 claims it wants to find the formula for the *perfect* relationship
couples will enter legally - binding marriage and cameras will follow them
they will be asked if they want to stay together or not after the filming
@entity160 : ' producers do n't know how commitment works '
@entity164 : ' people should build a friendship before marriage '
