by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 07:14 est , 16 march 2013 @entity1 was given 180 hours of community service yesterday after he admitted claiming benefits after a £ 250,000 lottery win a lottery winner who claimed £ 13,000 in benefits after his win escaped a jail term yesterday			1
@entity1 won £ 250,000 in march 2010 but continued to claim jobseeker 's allowance , housing benefit and council tax benefit , while spending £ 50,000 of his prize on buying his council house			2
yesterday sheriff @entity14 ordered @entity1 to carry out 180 hours of community service at a sentencing hearing at @entity17			1
she said : ' i still do n't understand your attitude or why you think your fellow citizens and taxpayers should pay for you - why should they pay for you when you have £ 250,000 there			0
' that 's a bizarre attitude			0
' his lawyer also told the court that @entity1 was now appealing a ruling that he was n't allowed benefits - despite telling the court he could access his invested money to pay a fine if necessary			1
@entity1 , from @entity32 , admitted claiming £ 7173.79 in jobseeker ’s allowance , £ 1391.82 in council tax benefit and £ 4825.52 in housing benefit after his windfall - a total of £ 13,391.13			1
his scam was discovered after an anonymous tip - off			0
he told investigators from the @entity41 that there was ' no money left ' and it was ' all gone on the bookies '			0
the court heard that @entity1 was living almost ' hand to mouth ' - because he was not earning any interest on the ' substantial ' sums he invested in bonds			1
@entity1 's bank statements showed that £ 250,000 had been deposited in his account by @entity52 on march 1 2010			2
it is unclear as to whether he won the cash on a scratchcard or in a @entity57 draw			0
@entity58 , defending , said @entity1 had given £ 50,000 of his winnings to his family , and spent another £ 50,000 on buying his council house			2
he said a substantial amount of the money - understood to be tens of thousands of pounds - was invested in bonds , but that had left @entity1 without any cash			1
mr @entity58 said : ' he now realises that what he did was n't right but he was in the benefits culture and it was like his lottery win was forgotten about			0
' i hate to use the phrase a hand to mouth existence , but he 's not getting any money - he 's getting no interest from his bonds			1
' he has not had any benefits at all for over a year , and that matter is being taken to appeal			0
sheriff @entity14 , sitting at @entity17 , told @entity1 : ' i still do n't understand your attitude or why you think your fellow citizens and taxpayers should pay for you ' ' i do n't know his chances of success , however , but there is a possibility he will restart benefits			1
' he thinks he has been harshly dealt with and his concepts that he could simply be admonished is completely and utterly ridiculous			0
' @entity90 told @entity1 : ' you seem you accept now that the world does n't owe you a living			2
' this order is a direct alternative to imprisonment , and if it is breached then you will come back before me and i 'll have little alternative but to send you to custody			0

@entity17 heard he was living ' hand to mouth ' because of low - earning bonds
