@entity0 failed to appreciate the @entity2 jobs market would prove a magnet for @entity5 plumbers , one of @entity8 ’s most senior advisers admitted yesterday			1
the admission was one of a series of revelations about how the last @entity13 chronically mishandled eastern @entity15 immigration			0
one @entity17 minister said he had warned the influx was having a huge impact on hospitals and wages - but was largely ignored by his colleagues			0
in the end , more than one million travelled – with at least half that number settling in what is one of the biggest waves of immigration in @entity2 history			2
they were attracted by wages which are significantly higher than back home			0
sir @entity24 , who was mr @entity8 ’s most senior @entity25 adviser between 2000 and 2004 , said : ‘ we simply did n’t take account properly of the pull factor of @entity49 for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [ in the @entity2 ] for their skills - you know , the @entity5 plumber			1
’ in comments which will pose a huge headache for @entity58 , sir @entity24 also admitted the decision to throw open @entity2 ’s borders at a time when other countries were imposing transitional controls was ‘ political ’			1
the remarks risk re-igniting the debate about @entity0 ’s record – for which the @entity0 leader recently apologised			2
@entity69 of @entity70 said the figure of 13,000 @entity5 workers settling in the @entity2 originally given by @entity0 was ' completely worthless ' ( file image ) sir @entity24 said : ‘ the primary argument was the political one – this was the right thing to do , we attached a lot of importance to them as democratic countries and keeping our position as the number one friend of eastern and central @entity15			1
’ last night , @entity69 of @entity70 , chairman of the @entity83 campaign group , told the @entity84 : ‘ it is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between @entity2 and a huge country like @entity5			1
‘ we said at the time the forecast of 13,000 - a - year was almost worthless			2
in fact , it was completely worthless			0
’ yesterday , it also emerged that ex-labour cabinet minister @entity94 had written to chancellor @entity95 and home secretary @entity96 to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact			1
he said the government failed to recognise what was happening in constituencies like his own in @entity106 , where wages were driven down by as much as 50 per cent , @entity100 departments came under strain and 1,000 migrants attempted to sign up for an @entity111 - as - a - second language course in a single day			0
mr @entity94 added : ‘ the whole irony of this is that in some respects @entity8 was obsessed by immigration , particularly about illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system , but on @entity25 migration there was a catastrophic failure of the civil service machine			0
’ in further bombshell remarks , the respected economist @entity123 , writing in the left - wing @entity125 newspaper , exploded @entity0 ’s economic case for mass migration			1
he argued that , at best , it had a ‘ barely perceptible ’ impact on economic growth per head while supressing the wages of the less well - off			0
mr @entity123 said : ‘ @entity0 allowed direct competition to enter the @entity2 labour market on a scale unprecedented in our history … it is the relatively unskilled in the bottom half of the distribution who have lost out			1
former home secretary @entity144 ( pictured ) has defended @entity0 's record on mass migration , saying he is ' confident ' it was the right policy , ' even though very few people now will stand up for it ' ‘ the liberal elite do not suffer			1
indeed , they benefit because many of the services they consume are provided at lower prices than would have been the case without mass immigration			0
’ his comments were echoed by ex-labour home secretary @entity156 , who said : ‘ the person that benefits from … growth is often not the one worried that their kid is going to get less attention from the teacher in the class room because there are people speaking @entity5			1
’ but two more @entity168 from the @entity0 years were unrepentant about the party ’s record , despite the fact @entity58 has since apologised for how it handled the influx			2
@entity96 , who was sacked over the foreign prisoner scandal in 2006 , said : ‘ it ’s nonsense to suggest it has terrible impact on public services – most of the people coming here were working , did n’t have children , and were not of age to be a big burden on @entity184			0
’ @entity144 said : ‘ i ’m confident that it was the right decision , even though very few people now will stand up for it			2
i just think that allowing people to move [ to the @entity2 ] but not to work would have been a complete own goal			0

sir @entity24 said @entity0 failed to realise attraction @entity2 would pose
lord @entity69 said estimate of *13,000immigrants* per year was ' worthless '
former home secretary @entity144 *rushed* to defend mass migration
