and after ending a 797 - minute wait for a goal , the 25 - year - old , who was playing only his fifth game following ankle surgery in the summer , said : ‘ it means a lot to me to get back on the score sheet			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 rose majestically above the @entity8 defence to head home and put his team in front the @entity26 striker , who has spent most of the year sidelined through injury , jumps for joy after scoring ‘ i 've played a couple of games and i 'm back , but until you score you do n't feel like you are definitely back			1
but now i 've scored i am definitely back			2
‘ it is a great feeling			0
it is fantastic to be back on the pitch and playing as many games as i have in the last few weeks			2
' there is nothing better than scoring goals as a striker , so i was desperate to get a goal and it is great feeling			0
‘ you always have to just think about the positives ( when injured )			0
the medical staff have helped me a lot and it is credit to them that i am back			2
’ the result takes @entity1 into the top three for the first time since 1999 , albeit only until tonight when they will be overtaken by either @entity52 or @entity53 , who meet at @entity55 ’s			1

‘ we deserved to win and won playing good attacking football			2
’ asked if it was @entity0 ’s best performance for @entity1 , @entity67 added : ‘ i have to say it was close to it			1
when he scores two you have to say yes			0
' we thought about taking him off after the second but let him try to get the hat - trick			2
’ @entity8 manager @entity80 was furious with his side ’s performance , but indicated he will appeal the decision to send off @entity62 as he claimed @entity60 handballed before being brought down by @entity62 outside the area			2
he also contested whether it was a goal - scoring opportunity			0
@entity0 celebrates with @entity87 after heading in @entity1 's second goal after the break @entity8 boss @entity80 was unhappy with his side 's performance in the 3 - 1 defeat at @entity1 defeat he said : ‘ look at the build - up - @entity60 knocks it past with his hand clearly			1
' realistically it should have been handball to us and it was n't a clear goalscoring opportunity from the way it played out so when you look at it , it suggests it was n't			0
' you 'd think we would appeal when you have the benefit of the replays			0
' @entity80 added : ‘ we did n’t reach the levels we can play – that is the first time i can say that this season			0
