' we like the profile			0
we think he can adapt to the @entity34			0
' @entity3 was being closely monitored by several @entity36 clubs despite being banned for 10 games in november for a tackle which left @entity39 of @entity40 with a broken leg and dislocated ankle			1
@entity0 added : ' if we do n’t do it now , we ca n’t do it in the summer because other clubs were strong on him			2
he will join us for pre-season and ew will see if it is to stay or go on loan			2
he is a young player for a position where we need a future			0
job done , and he stays at @entity4			2
' he is very young but he is playing already a couple of seasons in @entity54 and many international matches for the youth teams			0
he is a player with good potential			0

the year started with @entity0 insisting he could not foresee any transfers in or out of @entity85 during the january window but he has already signed winger @entity87 , plus midfielders @entity88 and @entity90			1
@entity3 ’s arrival will raise questions over the futures of established central defenders @entity95 and @entity96			2
acrobatic : @entity3 is an athletic player with caps at all youth levels for @entity10 , plus a call up to the senior side @entity102 no more ? the signing will raise doubts over the futures of @entity96 ( left ) and @entity95 ( right ) @entity0 has admitted he would like to keep @entity96 but fears he could lose his captain because of the strict club policy to offer contract extensions of only a year to all players over 30			1
@entity96 , who is already free to talk to clubs outside @entity112 , is expected to have far more lucrative and longer offers on the table than the one from @entity85			2
@entity95 has been unable to force his way into @entity0 ’s preferred back four and is in demand from some of @entity119 ’s biggest clubs			1
@entity120 and @entity121 have long - standing interest in the @entity123			0
the tackle for which @entity3 was banned for 10 matches			2
