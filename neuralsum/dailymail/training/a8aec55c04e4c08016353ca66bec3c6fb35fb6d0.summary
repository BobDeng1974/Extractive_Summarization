throughout his short life , young @entity0 had admired the bravery of the @entity3			1
but after years spent battling leukaemia , it was the youngster 's courage fighting cancer which inspired his heroes to honour his bravery			1
the 12 - year - old from @entity10 had suffered from the disease throughout his life			0
first diagnosed just before his second birthday , he had beaten leukaemia three times - but the chemotherapy had reduced his immune system and , last weekend , he died from a fungus which attacked his brain			2
and standing guard outside his hospital room that night was a local @entity3 named @entity22 who was so moved by @entity0 's continued cancer battle that he decreed the 12 - year - old to be a honorary member of the elite military unit			1
' he was very aware of his illness he knew exactly what medications he was on and what time he should have them , ' ms @entity36 said			0
' he knew that by him knowing when he had to take his medications and what they were , his mom had to worry less			0
he was very worried about anyone leaving sleep over him			0
his mother @entity52 certainly had a lot on her mind over the past few months , as @entity0 had two younger brothers and two older stepbrothers			2
on top of that , ms @entity52 was seriously injured at the @entity59 as the country band @entity60 's stage fell			1
seven people were killed , and ms @entity52 was one of the 58 injured			2
she had to have 30 staples in her skull and had steel rods and pins placed in her leg			0
as she recovered , @entity0 was characteristically caring , helping his mother wash her hair when she had trouble moving in the months following the august 2011 stage collapse			1
fighting the long fight : @entity0 had leukaemia three times , and at the time of his death he was technically cancer - free but died due to an infection ' when i started walking again after the incident , he was so worried about me , saying " you need to keep your feet up @entity81 ! you have to watch your step , " ' mrs @entity52 told @entity37			1
' he never complained , he never said " why me ? " or " i do n't want to do this "			0
' if he got sick , he would finish and say " i 'm sorry " because you were holding the bucket for him			0
i always told him that he had nothing to be sorry about			0
' @entity0 's repeat cancer battle inspired the local @entity3 , who thought ' he ’s fought as hard as any marine has and because of that we ’re going to honour him '			1
they planned to give him a complete colour guard spectacle , but because @entity0 's condition was less stable following a stem cell procedure on march 12 , they had to suspend those plans for fear of infecting @entity0 's sensitive immune system			1
family : technically cancer - free at the time of his death , @entity0 , bottom left , is seen here with two of his brothers and his mother @entity52 , who was seriously injured at a @entity60 concert last august ' he had a passion for our country and our military and it was more the marines got sparked in @entity0 and they heard of his battle , ' ms @entity36 told @entity37			1
the youngster 's father @entity117 told local station @entity119 : ' they decided @entity0 , with the strength and honour and courage he showed through the whole thing , he should be a @entity3			1
' when @entity0 's condition took a turn for the worse on friday night , his family got in touch with a local @entity3 who said that he would rush to the hospital to be with the boy during his final hours			1
@entity3 @entity22 , 39 , who was introduced to @entity0 through mr @entity117 , presented the boy with a flag and @entity3 navigator wings			2
' unfortunately , @entity0 was not awake , he was on a ventilator , but we believe he knew , ' ms @entity36 said , having been at the hospital at the time of the ceremony			2
courage : @entity0 may have admired the strength of the marines - but they admired him as he bravely fought cancer and his father @entity117 , right , said the @entity3 decided @entity0 should be an honorary member long disease : @entity0 was first diagnosed with leukemia when he was 22 months old in keeping with the @entity146 motto of @entity147 , latin for always faithful , the @entity3 stood post outside of @entity0 's door all night , saluting mrs @entity52 as she went in and out of the room , right up until @entity0 passed on saturday			1
' the night before @entity0 passed , he stood guard at @entity0 's door at the hospital all night long for eight hours straight , ' mr @entity117 said			1
mr @entity22 , who was initially hesitant to go public for fear it would take away from @entity0 's story , spoke with @entity158 , telling how he knew he had to spend the night guarding @entity0 's door because it was what he deserved			1
' there was no question that was my calling that night , ' he said			0
' i did n’t give myself a time constraint and i knew i was going to be there as long as i could be			0
' @entity167 's website states that the title of ' @entity169 ' reinforces the special bond between the @entity172 people and the @entity146 by ' recognising individuals in the civilian community who have made extraordinary contributions to the @entity3			2
