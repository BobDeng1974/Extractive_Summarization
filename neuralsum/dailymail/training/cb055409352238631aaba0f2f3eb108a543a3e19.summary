by @entity0 published : 13:33 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 15:30 est , 4 january 2013 @entity1 , former @entity2 presenter for @entity3 , has died at the age of 93			1
the presenter and actress became the voice behind 15 minutes of magic for a generation of children during the 1950s and 60s			1
they sat eagerly around the wireless to hear her familiar opening words : ' are you sitting comfortably ? then i 'll begin			0
' listen with me : @entity1 on @entity3 on @entity16 which shot her to fame iconic : @entity1 , actress and presenter was the voice for @entity2 radio show listen with mother @entity1 - a perfect balance between no - nonsense matron and kindly aunt - went on to enthral around a million juvenile listeners every weekday , simply by telling a story or introducing a song			1
so perhaps the greatest compliment to the lifelong actress and voiceover queen was that scores of adults , who recognised her at various stages during a long and varied career , were delighted to tell her : ' i grew up with you ! ' yesterday the @entity2 announced that the voice had finally fallen silent			2
@entity1 died peacefully at the age of 93 , her family said			1
to anyone who did n't grow up in the 1950s and 60s it is difficult to explain how such a basic formula captivated huge swathes of the nation for 15 minutes after lunch , slotted in before mum finished the washing up and sat down to @entity51 at 2pm			2
but television was still in its infancy - and a narrated tale of animals , cars or some fantastical adventure was entertainment enough for all those comfortably - seated youngsters			0
it did n't last , of course			0
life of acting : ms @entity1 on 1990s television series ' @entity64 ' the show , which @entity67 presented for two decades from its first broadcast in 1950 , was eventually shunted into an obscure slot with a different format and presenters , and inevitably fell victim to tv			1
a petition signed by high profile fans such as @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 failed to save it from the chop when it went out with a whimper , and a tiny audience of fewer than 40,000 , in 1982			0
few may have realised , however , that @entity67 enthusiastically embraced the future			0
the acting school graduate and former wartime @entity87 entertainer appeared in early episodes of @entity90 ( as spinster @entity91 ) ; and later in @entity93 , @entity94			0
voice of a generation : ms @entity1 , pictured in 1999 , was an iconic voice for children growing up in the 1950s and 60s she played village shop - owner mrs @entity98 in the 1970s sitcom to @entity101 , and was one of the voices behind @entity105 's irreverent weekly press review , what the papers say			1
bizarrely , perhaps , she forged a long partnership with comedian @entity109 , appearing on various shows as his comic foil			0
her last role was in 2008 , playing an elderly @entity113 alongside @entity114 in a @entity116 episode of dr who			0
@entity1 's husband @entity119 , whom she married in 1951 , died nine years ago and her twilight years were spent in a retirement home for actors in @entity123 , @entity124			1
she is survived by two daughters , @entity126 and @entity127 - and by two grandsons who may yet come to tell their own children how great granny 's voice became friend to a generation .			2
