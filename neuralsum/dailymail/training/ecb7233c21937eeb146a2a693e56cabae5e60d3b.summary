by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 are a win away from a return to the @entity4 after a 54 - year absence as they prepare to face @entity7 in the @entity9 play - off final at @entity10 a week tomorrow			1
@entity1 official @entity11 explains why the @entity13 ’s proposed changes make their remarkable comeback story even more unlikely ... i felt sick when i heard about the proposals			1
it ’s very , very worrying for a club like @entity1 and i really hope this is not allowed to happen			1
@entity20 ? @entity13 chairman @entity21 has proposed to restructure lower leagues by introducing @entity24 b teams @entity26 football is all about the @entity28 clubs , as well as the 15 or so professional clubs in the @entity30			1
and yet this feels like the @entity24 is just wagging its tail again			1
it ’s all right for the @entity24 and @entity34 because these new b sides wo n’t be allowed promotion above @entity37 but it ’s a different story for the rest of us			1
we have waited 54 years to get back into the @entity4			1
now it feels so near they want to dilute and weaken the achievement			0
they ’re talking about b teams but what they mean is reserve teams			0
say we do go up and we get the chance to play away at a club like @entity52 , @entity54 winners not so long ago			0
that would be a massive game for @entity1			2
but under these proposed new rules we could be forced to play @entity59 reserves instead			0
what ’s that about ? and how competitive are these b teams going to be ? surely @entity63 are n’t going to care about getting three points in the same way as @entity1 would if we went to @entity66 or @entity67 in @entity68 , for example			1
bundles ! @entity1 players celebrate during their play - off semi-final victory over @entity73 and who is going to watch them ? clubs like ours are supported by people in the area ; people for whom @entity1 really means something			2
there ’s history and tradition there			0
where will they even stage their games ? they ’ll probably have to borrow non-league grounds			0
you ’re just weakening the league from all different angles			2
i can understand why they want to change things but these proposals are not the right way to go about it			0
the @entity4 needs to be strong on this one			2
it ’s a worrying time for a club like ours .			0
