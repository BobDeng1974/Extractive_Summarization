a human - like ‘ skin ’ for aircraft - allowing them to detect any damage and ‘ feel ’ the world around them - is being developed by @entity9 experts			1
engineers at @entity11 ’ @entity12 are investigating a ‘ smart skin ’ concept which could be embedded with tens of thousands of micro-sensors			1
when applied to an aircraft , it will enable it to sense wind speed , temperature , physical strain and movement , far more accurately than current sensor technology allows			1
scroll down for audio interview discussing the project @entity11 in @entity26 has revealed a new technology for aircraft			1
a human - like ' skin ' will detect damage and ' feel ' the world around the plane ( illustration shown )			1
the smart skin would be embedded with thousands of micro-sensors			1
these can sense wind speed , temperature and movement accurately the revolutionary ‘ smart skin ’ concept will enable aircraft to continually monitor their health , reporting back on potential problems before they become significant			1
the @entity48 has revealed plans to replace tanks with small , ' off road ' vehicles covered in smart armour that is more adaptable to modern weaponry			0
military bosses says that current tanks are hindering soldier 's ability to get into battle			0
the @entity60 ( @entity62 ) programme , dubbed ' x-planes for tanks ' , is designed to develop a range of new vehicles			0
' @entity62 's goal is not just to improve or replace one particular vehicle - it 's about breaking the " more armor " paradigm and revolutionizing protection for all armored fighting vehicles , ' said @entity72 , @entity73 program manager			0
' inspired by how x-plane programs have improved aircraft capabilities over the past 60 years , we plan to pursue groundbreaking fundamental research and development to help make future armored fighting vehicles significantly more mobile , effective , safe and affordable			0
' engineers say the smart skin system would reduce the need for regular check - ups on the ground and parts could be replaced in a timely manner , increasing the efficiency of aircraft maintenance , the availability of the plane and improving safety			2
the tiny sensors or ‘ motes ’ can be as small as grains of rice and even as small as dust particles at less than 0.002 inches squared ( one millimetre squared )			0
collectively , the sensors would have their own power source and when paired with the appropriate software , be able to communicate in much the same way that human skin sends signals to the brain			2
the sensors are so small that @entity11 is exploring the possibility of retrofitting them to existing aircraft and even spraying them on like paint			2
leading the research and development is senior research scientist @entity112 whose ‘ eureka ’ moment came when she was doing her washing and observed that her tumble dryer uses a sensor to prevent it from overheating			0
engineers say the smart skin system would reduce the need for regular check - ups on the ground and parts could be replaced in a timely manner , increasing the efficiency of aircraft maintenance.the tiny sensors or ‘ motes ’ ( shown ) can be as small as grains of rice and even as small as dust particles she said : ' observing how a simple sensor can be used to stop a domestic appliance overheating , got me thinking about how this could be applied to my work and how we could replace bulky , expensive sensors with cheap , miniature , multi-functional ones			1
' this in turn led to the idea that aircraft , or indeed cars and ships , could be covered by thousands of these motes creating a " smart skin " that can sense the world around them and monitor their condition by detecting stress , heat or damage			1
' the idea is to make platforms " feel " using a skin of sensors in the same way humans or animals do			2
' by combining the outputs of thousands of sensors with big data analysis , the technology has the potential to be a game - changer for the @entity9 industry			2
' in the future we could see more robust defence platforms that are capable of more complex missions whilst reducing the need for routine maintenance checks			0
' there are also wider civilian applications for the concept which we are exploring			0
' the research is part of a range of new systems being investigated by @entity11 under a major programme exploring next - generation technology for air platforms .			0

@entity11 in @entity26 has revealed a new technology for aircraft
the smart skin would be embedded with thousands of micro-sensors
the sensors act like human skin to detect damage and ' feel ' the world
these can sense wind speed , temperature and movement accurately
could then monitor health and locate potential problems like our *bodies*
