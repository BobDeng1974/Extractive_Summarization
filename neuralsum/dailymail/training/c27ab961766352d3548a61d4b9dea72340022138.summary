a donkey born in a @entity2 trench who saved countless soldiers ' lives on the battlefield is being honoured for his bravery almost 100 years on			1
@entity9 ' the sergeant ' was born in @entity10 after a shell wounded his pregnant mother as she went into labour during the @entity14 in 1916			1
troops brought the donkey up amid falling shells and gunfire on the frontline and weaned him on tins of condensed milk			0
war donkey : @entity9 in the 1920s with one of his keepers after he was ' demobbed '			2
he was born at the @entity26 in 1916 and saved countless soldiers ' lives @entity9 spent the next two years in the @entity28 , carrying equipment and soldiers , and he was even taught to raise his hoof in salute , with the troop of @entity34			1
@entity9 has now been awarded the @entity35 for bravery , the highest military honour for an animal , by the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41			1
@entity42 , @entity43 member and war historian , said : ' @entity9 played an important role in keeping up the morale of the troops , even if he just acted as a distraction from the horror of what was around them			2
' he gave them something else to think about rather than whether or not they would be killed			0
' he was a clever animal and even was even trained to raise his hoof in salute on command			1
' after the war he gave a lot of pleasure to children and helped raised a lot of money for charity			2
it 's only right that he should be honoured and i 'm glad he is recognised by the @entity40 museum			0
' despite being lauded for his role on the frontline , mystery surrounds the circumstances of @entity9 's birth			1
troops : the @entity34 ' somewhere in @entity10 ' during @entity2 they looked after @entity9 on the frontline - but he was wounded three times by shells in the space of two years troops : the @entity79 @entity41 riffles somewhere in @entity80 during the @entity2			1
after the end of the conflict they were based temporarily in @entity84 - and while there @entity9 was sold it has been claimed he was delivered by @entity41 troops following an agreed cease fire between @entity89 and enemy soldiers			1
with tank technology still in its infancy , donkeys and horses were still an essential tool in every country 's armoury during @entity2 however , as machine guns were developed throughout the conflict , they became less and less useful			0
the @entity101 mounted cavalry charges throughout the war			0
however , the key role of the horse - and the donkey - was as a method of transport to take weapons and supplies to the frontline			0
the motor car was still in the early stages of its development - and was certainly not versatile enough to cross the muddy terrain in @entity10 and @entity116			0
although railways could have been built , the process was time - consuming and it was easiest to transport things by donkey or horse			0
another account says @entity9 's mother was sent into labour after being hit by a shell and the baby donkey was born soon afterwards , only to be found by advancing @entity41 troops in @entity127 cowering next to her body			2
the young donkey was wounded three times by shellfire during his two years on the frontline			1
at the end of the war he was de-mobbed and in 1920 brought to @entity84 , where the @entity34 were briefly based before returning to @entity41			1
but before the soldiers left , @entity9 was sold at a charity auction to a woman known only as mrs @entity139 from @entity84 , @entity140			1
throughout the next 23 years @entity9 was used in a series of charity events raising thousands of pounds for the @entity143 , including donkey rides for children along the city 's beach			1
after his death , he was buried in @entity84 's @entity149 in 1943 and a monument erected			0
the grave fell into disrepair but it was restored in 2003			0
@entity42 said : ' there were many boys from this area who were in the @entity157 and were killed during @entity2			0
' @entity9 received the @entity35 and he was made an honorary sergeant with three stripes on his bridle			2
' @entity9 was injured three times by shell debris but he recovered each time			2
he is a big part of the @entity79 history and we want to make sure that he is never forgotten			0
' @entity9 will be honoured as part of an exhibition at the @entity39 in @entity40 , which will reopen on april 4 following a refurbishment .			0
