@entity1 no 2 @entity0 is guaranteed a spot in the main draw of the @entity4 after @entity6 champion @entity5 pulled out with a right shoulder injury on saturday			1
@entity0 has had a long and tense wait to find out if he needed to go through qualifying after originally being named as the sixth alternate when the main entry list was released last month			2
but a number of withdrawals - including that of @entity15 , @entity16 and now cilic - means that @entity0 is now within the main draw ranking cut and will not need to qualify for the first @entity18 of the year , which begins on january 19			1
@entity6 champion @entity5 has announced he will miss the @entity4 with a shoulder injury he said in a statement on his official website : ' i am really disappointed to announce that i had to withdraw from the @entity4			1
right shoulder injury , that hampers me for some time now and forced me to withdraw from the @entity25 event in @entity26 , is improving day by day , but i still do n't feel fit enough to be able to compete at the highest level			0
' i am really sad that i wo n't be able to participate in @entity28 , especially after winning the last grand slam in @entity30 , but i was advised by doctors to be careful as much as possible to avoid even more serious problems			0
' i have received lots of support letters from my fans worldwide lately and i am grateful for your support and best wishes			0
i was really looking forward to be back on court in @entity40 and now i hope we will meet very soon in @entity42			0
' @entity0 is the first @entity1 male singles player other than @entity43 to earn direct entry into a @entity18 since @entity45 at the @entity46			1
@entity0 has gained a place in the main draw as a consequence of @entity5 's absence the 27 - year - old is on the cusp of entering the top 100 for the first time , currently sitting at a ranking of @entity55 with few points to defend until march			1
@entity1 men who will have to go through qualifying at @entity58 next week are @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
@entity62 is the only @entity1 female in the main women 's singles draw , while @entity66 and @entity67 bid to qualify			2
@entity68 will be absent in @entity28 as she continues her rehabilitation from wrist surgery , with the 20 - year - old expected to return on the second - tier @entity73 circuit next month .			0
