a unique planet may be causing the star it orbits to act much older than it actually is , according to new data from @entity5 's @entity4			1
the star , @entity7 , and its planet , wasp - 18b , are located about 330 light - years from @entity10			1
astronomers were shocked to find it displaying traits of an old star - and say its planet is to blame			1
the artist 's illustration depicts a star and its planet , wasp - 18b , a giant exoplanet that orbits very close to it			1
a new study using @entity4 data has shown that wasp - 18b is making the star that it orbits act much older than it actually is			1
@entity30 's team determined @entity7 is between 500 million and 2 billion years old , based on theoretical models and other data			2
while this may sound old , it is considered young by astronomical standards			0
by comparison , our sun is about 5 billion years old and thought to be about halfway through its lifetime			2
using established relations between the magnetic activity and x-ray emission of stars , as well as its actual age , researchers determined @entity7 is about 100 times less active than it should be			0
wasp - 18b has a mass about 10 times that of @entity48 and completes one orbit around its star in less than 23 hours , placing @entity51 in the ' hot @entity48 ' category of exoplanets , or planets outside our solar system			1
wasp - 18b is the first known example of an orbiting planet that has apparently caused its star , which is roughly the mass of our sun , to display traits of an older star			1
' wasp - 18b is an extreme exoplanet , ' said @entity67 of the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) - @entity69 in @entity70 , who led the study			1
' it is one of the most massive hot @entity75 known and one of the closest to its host star , and these characteristics lead to unexpected behavior			2
' this planet is causing its host star to act old before its time			2
' @entity30 's team determined @entity7 is between 500 million and 2 billion years old , based on theoretical models and other data			0
while this may sound old , it is considered young by astronomical standards			0
by comparison , our sun is about 5 billion years old and thought to be about halfway through its lifetime			0
younger stars tend to be more active , exhibiting stronger magnetic fields , larger flares , and more intense @entity96 emission than their older counterparts			0
the right image reveals that no x-rays of the wasp - 18 system were detected during a long @entity4 observation			1
the source is visible in the optical image , left			0
the non-detection in @entity96 is surprising given the age of the star , suggesting that the planet is weakening the star 's magnetic field through tidal forces			2
magnetic activity , flaring , and x-ray emission are linked to the star 's rotation , which generally declines with age			0
however , when astronomers took a long look with @entity4 at @entity7 they did n't detect any x-rays			0
using established relations between the magnetic activity and x-ray emission of stars , as well as its actual age , researchers determined @entity7 is about 100 times less active than it should be			0
' we think the planet is aging the star by wreaking havoc on its innards , ' said co-author @entity132 of the @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135			1
the researchers argue that tidal forces created by the gravitational pull of the massive planet – similar to those the moon has on @entity10 's tides , but on a much larger scale – may have disrupted the magnetic field of the star			1
the strength of the magnetic field depends on the amount of convection in the star , or how intensely hot gas stirs the interior of the star			0
' the planet 's gravity may cause motions of gas in the interior of the star that weaken the convection , ' said co-author @entity160 also of @entity161 in @entity70			2
' this has a domino effect that results in the magnetic field becoming weaker and the star to age prematurely			0

the star , @entity168 - 18 , and its planet , wasp - 18b , are located around 330 light - years from @entity10
@entity172 is aging the star by ' wreaking havoc on its innards '
