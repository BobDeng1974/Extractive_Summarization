the heads of @entity1 are changing - and rapidly - skulls are getting bigger and faces are getting longer and narrower			1
within just 150 years , @entity1 heads have grown in volume by roughly the volume of a tennis ball			1
the survey of 1500 skulls compared skulls from the mid- 1800s to skulls from the @entity12 - and the shape is definitely changing			1
are @entity1 evolving ? the researchers do n't know - the changing head shapes ( found in samples of white @entity1 ) could also be due to better nutrition or racial mixing			1
@entity19 : within just 150 years , @entity1 heads have grown in volume by roughly the volume of a tennis ball ‘ the varieties of changes that have swept @entity1 life make determining an exact cause an endlessly complicated proposition , ’ said @entity22			1
‘ it likely results from modified growth patterns because of better nutrition , lower infant and maternal mortality , less physical work , and a breakdown of former ethnic barriers to marriage			2
which of these is paramount we do not know			0
’ the researchers found that the average height from the base to the top of the skull in men has increased by 0.3 inches			0
the skull size has grown by 200 cubic centimeters , a space equivalent to a tennis ball			1
in women , the corresponding increases are seven millimeters and 180 cubic centimeters			0
skull height has increased 6.8 percent since the late 1800s , while body height has increased 5.6 percent and femur length has only increased about 2 percent			2
also , skull - height has continued to change whereas the overall heightening has recently slowed or stopped			0
@entity57 : skull height has increased 6.8 percent since the late 1800s , while body height has increased 5.6 percent and femur length has only increased about 2 percent the scientists also noted changes that illustrate our population is maturing sooner			2
this is reflected in the earlier closing of a separation in the bone structure of the skull called the spheno - occipital synchondrosis , which in the past was thought to fuse at about age twenty			0
@entity73 and @entity74 , an adjunct assistant professor in the @entity76 , have found the bone is fusing much earlier — 14 for girls and 16 for boys			0
@entity1 's obesity epidemic is the latest development that could affect skeletal shape but its precise effects are unclear			2
‘ this might affect skull shape by changing the hormonal environment , which in turn could affect timing of growth and maturation , ’ said @entity73			0
‘ we know it has an effect on the long bones by increasing muscle attachment areas , increasing arthritis at certain joints , especially the knee , and increasing the weight bearing capacity			0
’ the research only assessed @entity1 of @entity102 ancestry because they provided the largest sample sizes to work with .			1

survey of 1500 skulls from mid- 1800s to 1980s
volume of skulls has risen by size of tennis ball
faces are becoming longer and narrower
are @entity1 evolving ? or are *lifestyle* *factors* to blame
study of white remains as largest sample size available
