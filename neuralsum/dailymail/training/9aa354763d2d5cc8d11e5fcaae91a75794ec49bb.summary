by @entity0 , @entity1 editor police were today accused of failing the public after it emerged seven out of every ten robbery investigations is ' dropped ' without any action			1
figures for @entity9 's biggest police force show 70 per cent of the 29,662 robberies reported to the @entity11 in 2013 ended in no further action			1
officers stopped investigating because they claimed there was insufficient evidence			0
the figures - which come at a time of increased scrutiny of the @entity11 - will fuel concern that police are not taking seriously crimes which are harder to solve			1
new figures : 70 per cent of the 29,662 robberies reported to the @entity11 in 2013 ended in no further action , it was revealed today half of the 29,576 thefts reported in @entity27 between june and december 2013 were also dropped			1

overall , just 1.9 per cent of all property crime incidents resulted in a custodial sentence			1
@entity39 , head of crime and justice at the @entity43 think - tank , said : ' these figures are truly shocking			2
' the fact that no action was taken on nearly half of all incidents last year is unacceptable			2
' we need to fundamentally reorder our policing priorities , free the police from responding to so many non-criminal incidents and allow them to focus on doing their job and catching criminals			0
' nothing could be more important for rebuilding public confidence in the police			0
' public confidence in the police - and the @entity11 in particular - has been battered by a string of recent scandals			1
these include @entity64 and the revelations of mass destruction of documents relating to the @entity69 case			0

burglary or robbery does n't simply result in financial loss			2
it can have long lasting emotional effects			0
' as a society we have developed a much too relaxed attitude about fighting property crime			0
politicians , the courts and the police need to step up to the plate and tackle the problem head on			0
' earlier this week , it was revealed how police have marked more than 100,000 crimes as solved in the past three years , despite only handing them over to be ' taken into consideration ' by the courts			2
the high number of cases marked as ' solved ' has sparked fears that police could be using the tactic as a way of boosting the number of ' detected ' crimes or crimes cleared up by forces			0
the @entity11 requested the highest number of @entity112 in two years			2
last night , the force insisted robberies , mobile phone thefts , bicycle thefts and residential burglaries			2
