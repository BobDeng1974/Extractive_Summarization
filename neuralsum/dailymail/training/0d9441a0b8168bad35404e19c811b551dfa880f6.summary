by @entity0 published : 04:38 est , 12 september 2012 updated : 06:32 est , 12 september 2012 a mother who suffered two miscarriages today thanked tv presenter @entity3 for ' saving ' the life of her miracle baby			2
@entity6 , 34 , had lost two daughters due to a weak cervix when she unexpectedly fell pregnant again			1
but as she reacted with fear to the possibility of losing a third child , her husband @entity9 , 34 , recalled an item he watched on @entity15 ’s @entity14 , presented by host @entity3 , about a rarely used ' bionic band ' procedure for mothers - to - be			1
overjoyed : @entity6 and her husband @entity9			1
mrs @entity6 had lost two babies due to a weak cervix when she fell pregnant again			1
but mr @entity22 recalled an item he watched on @entity15 's @entity14 about a rarely used ' bionic band ' procedure just days later mrs @entity6 had a consultation at @entity27 - within 48 hours she went under the knife for a transabdominal cervical cerclage , a stitching procedure which has been given to less than 150 women in the region			1
the operation involves fitting a ‘ bionic band ’ over the neck of the cervix , keeping it shut during pregnancy , protecting the foetus from infection and lowering the chances of miscarriage			1
the procedure was a success and after resting through the remainder of her pregnancy , @entity22 and mrs @entity6 ’s dreams came true when @entity49 was born on august 23			2
now the happy couple have taken @entity52 home to @entity53 , @entity54 , where she was introduced to her six - year - old big brother @entity55			0
mrs @entity6 , a care assistant , today said : ' @entity49 ’s just perfect , my little miracle - and its thanks to this morning that i found out about saving her			2
' i ca n’t describe what it was like to hold her for the first time			0
@entity9 and i have been through a lot of despair losing two babies and we just felt joyful to have @entity49 with us , healthy and gorgeous			0
welcome : @entity49 relaxes in hospital shortly after her birth family : mr and mrs @entity6 , @entity49 and her older brother @entity69 ' the help and support we ’ve had from @entity27 and the midwives have been brilliant and i ’d just like to say to expectant mothers who experience problems that help is out there			0
' it just took us a bit of luck by watching @entity3 to find it			0
' mrs @entity6 had been diagnosed with having a weak cervix and as a result her waters twice broke at 22 weeks , in 2008 and then 2010 , losing daughters @entity85 and @entity87 respectively			1
after the second tragedy mrs @entity6 was told her cervix was n’t strong enough to hold a baby to full term and she was so traumatised that she told her husband she never wanted to have another baby			1
so last year , when mrs @entity6 discovered she was pregnant again she instantly fell to pieces with all the horrors of what had happened rushing back			2
she said : ' when i fell pregnant again we had mixed feelings as it was very likely to happen again			2
' but @entity9 remembered seeing something on this morning about a woman who told how she had undergone an operation in which her womb was tied to prevent the baby from coming too early			0
@entity3 , pictured with his @entity14 co-host @entity106 , is a hero in the @entity22 household ' he thought that procedure could help us and i asked for a referral to @entity27			1
' it was a bit of a whirlwind but after talking to the consultant i knew it would give my baby the best chance			0
it was even more delicate because i was eight weeks gone and ideally the operation should happen before pregnancy			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity27 said : ‘ the synthetic band , known as a transabdominal cerclage is like a band of steel which is placed at the neck of the womb			0
' it has a 95 per cent success rate but is only carried out at a handful of centres in the @entity131			0
' a spokesman for @entity15 ’s @entity14 said : ' it ’s always great to hear from viewers of the show , but to know that the programme helped @entity6 and @entity9 with such a precious gift of a baby is just fantastic			1
