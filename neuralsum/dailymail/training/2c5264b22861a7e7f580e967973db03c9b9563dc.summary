by @entity0 published : 15:18 est , 11 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:56 est , 12 february 2014 gov. @entity3 said tuesday he was suspending the use of the death penalty in @entity6 , announcing a move that he hopes will enable officials to ' join a growing national conversation about capital punishment			1
' the @entity11 said he came to the decision after months of review , meetings with family members of victims , prosecutors and law enforcement			2
' there have been too many doubts raised about capital punishment , there are too many flaws in this system today , ' @entity3 said at a news conference			1
' there is too much at stake to accept an imperfect system			2
' suspended : @entity30 @entity6 governor @entity3 has suspended executions for as long as he is governor , he announced tuesday reprieve : @entity3 wo n't pardon death row inmates , but if their execution is scheduled while he is governor he will grant a reprieve to delay the sentence @entity3 said that the use of the death penalty is inconsistent and unequal			1
the governor 's staff briefed lawmakers about the move on monday night and tuesday morning			1
@entity3 's moratorium , which will be in place for as long as he is governor , means that if a death penalty case comes to his desk , he will issue a reprieve , which is n't a pardon and does n't commute the sentences of those condemned to death			1
' during my term , we will not be executing people , ' said @entity3 , who was elected in 2012			1
' nobody is getting out of prison , period			2
' last year , @entity58 abolished the death penalty , the 18th state to do so and the sixth in the last six years			0
nine men await execution at the @entity64 in @entity65			0
the state @entity67 just last month rejected a petition for release from death row inmate @entity70 , sentenced for the murder of a 12 - year - old girl in 1988			0
debate : so far , 18 states have banned capital punishment as the debate over the death penalty wages on @entity70 could be the first execution in the state since september 2010 , when @entity80 died by lethal injection for the 1991 murder of a @entity84 - area woman			1
a federal stay had recently been lifted in @entity70 's case , and a remaining state stay on his execution was expected to be lifted this month			0
the decision by the governor comes following a recent decision by the state @entity92 , which is in the process of changing its execution protocol to allow witnesses to executions to see the entire process , including the insertion of intravenous catheters during a lethal injection			2
the new witness protocol , currently a draft that is in its final stages of approval , includes the use of television monitors to show the inmate entering the death chamber and being strapped down , as well as the insertion of the @entity111 , which had both previously been shielded from public view			0
spared : if not for @entity3 's order , @entity113 could have been the first person executed in @entity6 in 10 years through public disclosure requests , the @entity0 had sought information about any potential changes to the execution protocols			1
state corrections officials spoke with the @entity0 about the new procedures late last month			0
the change is in response to a 2012 federal appeals court ruling that said all parts of an execution must be fully open to public witnesses			0
that ruling was sparked by a case brought by the @entity0 and other news organizations who challenged @entity132 's policy to shield the insertion of iv catheters from public view , in spite of a 2002 ruling from the same court that said every aspect of an execution should be open to witnesses .			0

@entity3 says ' too many doubts ' have been raised about capital punishment to continue executing people
@entity3 will grant a reprieve to anyone scheduled to die while he is governor
a reprieve is n't a pardon and condemned inmates will not have their sentences commuted
