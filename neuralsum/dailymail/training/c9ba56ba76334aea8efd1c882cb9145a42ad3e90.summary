it is an assignment few will envy - taking on the one of the strongest teams in @entity3 and the favourites to win this season 's @entity5			1
and if @entity8 are to have any hope of beating @entity10 in their last 16 tie , they will need their star man @entity12 firing			1
the @entity14 hotshot was the top scorer in the competition after the group phase , scoring nine times , including five in @entity8 's 7 - 0 thrashing of @entity19			1
the other was @entity44 for @entity45 against @entity46 in 2012			0
he also scored the third quickest hat - trick in the competition 's history ( 12 minutes ) as the @entity35 side racked up the biggest - ever half - time lead ( 6 - 0 ) in @entity3 's premier tournament			1
but taking on the @entity54 champions is an entirely different proposition and current circumstances are n't exactly ideal for the reigning @entity35 champions			0
they are currently living a nomadic existence , with their @entity60 abandoned amid the ongoing conflict between @entity35 and pro-russian separatists			0
as if to illustrate the volatility of the situation in eastern @entity35 , the @entity60 was shelled back in october , causing damage to the giant glass panels that form its facade			0
@entity12 in action during the return match with @entity19 , played in @entity22 back in november includes all competitions 2006 - 2007 6 games , 0 goals 2007 - 2008 19 games , 5 goals 2008 - 2009 29 games , 9 goals 2009 - 2010 36 games , 17 goals 2010 - 2011 37 games , 20 goals 2011 - 2012 35 games , 16 goals 2012 - 2013 32 games , 15 goals 2013 - 2014 39 games , 25 goals 2014 - 2015 20 games , 14 goals damage to the glass facade of the @entity60 in @entity91 following an artillery attack by @entity94 rebels @entity12 controls the ball on his chest under pressure from @entity19 's @entity98 and @entity99 ( right ) @entity19 's goalkeeper is beaten from 12 yards as @entity8 run riot in @entity102 @entity103 @entity104 2006 @entity8 @entity105 2008 - 09 @entity106 2007 - 08 , 2009 - 10 , 2010 - 11 , 2011 - 12 , 2012 - 13 , 2013 - 14 @entity107 2008 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 @entity108 2008 , 2010 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 so the first leg tie will be played some 750 miles ( 1,200km ) to the east in @entity22 , meaning @entity8 miss out on many of the home advantages so crucial in the @entity5			1
but one constant amid the upheaval has been @entity12 's goals - he has 14 in just 20 matches across all competitions so far this season			2
and he is out of contract in the summer			0
with the upheaval at @entity8 unlikely to be resolved in the near - future , @entity12 has n't committed to a new deal and this has alerted a host of @entity3 's leading clubs as he would be available for nothing			2
he hails from @entity127 , grew up idolising @entity128 and @entity129 and started his career at hometown club @entity103 , for whom he made 12 league appearances and scored three goals during the 2006 - 2007 campaign			1
but before he reached that stage , he had to choose between football and his other great talent - music			0
he played in a rock band back home and never misses an opportunity to show off his singing skills			0
the highlight of his short career at the club came against @entity147 champions @entity45 in the final of the 2006 @entity104			0
having scored the winner against @entity151 in the semi-finals , the striker came on as a late substitute in the final and assisted @entity155 in scoring the winner			0
@entity12 celebrates with @entity157 ( right ) after scoring against @entity158 in a @entity5 tie in 2012 around this time , he was involved in the @entity160 under 20 squad , making 11 appearances and scoring twice , but he did n't make the step - up to the @entity160 's first team until last year			1
in march 2007 , @entity12 followed in the footsteps of many other @entity14 players by moving to the @entity35 league with @entity8 for a fee of about £ 2.5m			1
his first full season with @entity8 resulted in @entity35 league glory and in 2009 , he scored the team 's first goal in their @entity105 final win over @entity174			1
by 2009 - 2010 he was fully settled in @entity91 and his goalscoring ratios steadily climbed - in 2009 - 10 he scored 17 goals in 36 games and the following year got 20 in 37			2
@entity12 goes up for a challenge with @entity180 's @entity179 during a 2010 @entity105 tie his goals helped @entity8 to an outstanding period of success as they won the title five seasons in a row and became a dangerous opponent to face in @entity3			1
in february 2011 , he scored the decisive goal in their 3 - 2 away win over @entity191 in the first leg of a last 16 tie			2
his involvement in @entity3 has sometimes been controversial			0
he received a one - match suspension for unsporting behaviour after pouncing on a @entity157 backpass to the @entity199 goalkeeper following an injury and going on to score			0
@entity8 backed @entity105 's sanctions and said they were deeply disappointed by @entity12 's actions			2
across all competitions , he has 122 goals in 253 appearances for the club and his fourth goal against @entity19 meant he overtook @entity208 to become their all - time leading goalscorer			1
@entity12 had understandably hoped to receive a call - up to the @entity160 squad for last summer 's @entity104 finals on home territory but @entity214 overlooked him			2
however , in october , @entity215 called him up for the friendlies against @entity217 and @entity218 , and he made his debut in the former .			0

@entity12 will lead the line for @entity8 in their @entity5 last 16 tie with @entity10 on tuesday night
he scored five goals in their 7 - 0 win away to @entity19 in the group
@entity14 was second player to score five goals in a cl game ( other is @entity44 )
@entity12 was born in @entity127 and played for @entity103
moved to @entity8 for £ 2.5m in 2007 and is club 's all - time leading scorer
he has won six @entity35 league titles and four @entity35 cups
@entity12 is out of contract at the end of the season
