@entity11 mayor @entity76 yesterday declared this the year of ' forgiveness and understanding ' the ' @entity15 ' were executed at the end of the @entity17 ( pictured right ) , which took place along the @entity210 in the autumn of 1862			1
the native @entity3 people had ceded 24million acres of land in @entity12 to the @entity7 government in one of the most significant @entity217 treaties in history , signed in 1851			1
such treaties were instrumental in opening the @entity7 west to @entity222 settlement			2
in exchange , they were promised reservation lands and $ 3,075,000 , to be paid over a 50 - year period in annual annuities of goods and money			1
this came to about 12 cents an acre for some of the richest agricultural land in the country			0
the treaties were later amended to weaken the position of the @entity237 , who were left with just two reservations , each 20 miles wide and about 70 miles long , delayed and skipped payments drove the native americans to increasing desperation			0
in 1862 , the @entity139 seized an opportunity , with most able - bodied @entity7 men away fighting the @entity141 , and very nearly succeeded			1
before the @entity7 - @entity94 ( or @entity94 , as it is often called ) could be brought under control , at least 450 white settlers and soldiers were killed and considerable property was destroyed in southern @entity12			1
there were uncounted numbers of @entity3 casualties because of the @entity217 custom of removing all dead and dying warriors from the battlefield			0
the conflict launched a series of @entity217 wars on the northern plains that did not end until 1890			0
a five - man military commission was appointed to try the @entity3 who had participated in the outbreak			0
the commission settled up to 40 cases in a single day			0
some were heard in as little as five minutes			0
in all , the commission tried 392 prisoners , sentenced 307 to death and gave 16 prison terms			2
president @entity52 heard there had been injustices and was urged to show compassion by @entity274 bishop @entity273			2
@entity52 reviewed the cases and then wrote a letter to @entity12 gov. @entity277 , listing 39 men who should be hanged , including one who was later given a reprieve			1
those who were spared were sent from a prison in @entity11 to one in @entity103 , @entity104 , where many died from squalid conditions			2
some native americans believe @entity52 was wrong to order any hangings at all , and that several of those found guilty were innocent of all wrongdoing			2
a further 1,600 @entity3 were held at a camp at @entity14 until being sent out of @entity12 , and virtually all others fled the state			2
after the war , @entity12 's second governor , @entity277 , said the @entity3 should be exterminated or driven from the state			2
this august , gov. @entity293 marked the 150th anniversary of the start of the war by asking @entity296 to ' remember the dark past ' and by repudiating @entity277 's comments .			0

around 500 paid tribute to those hanged in @entity11 , @entity12 , in 1862
deaths followed the @entity7 - @entity94 , which was fought along the river

mayor of @entity11 declared this the ' year of forgiveness and understanding '
