by @entity0 the search for the missing @entity2 in the southern @entity3 will continue for up to another year despite recent setbacks			0
a new area of up to 800 kilometres long and 70 kilometres wide is expected to be selected for the new search zone			1
the @entity8 survey ship @entity9 , has already begun mapping the new ocean floor and is expected to continue for the next three months			1
the data collected by the ship , which is conducting a bathymetric survey , will determine if new search equipment can be safely towed to the area 's sea floor to search for the airline which went missing on march 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew			1
the previous two - month - long search for the airline drew doubts from @entity34 sources earlier this week when the acoustic ' pings ' , which were at the centre of the search , were no longer believed to be coming from the aircraft 's black box			1
the @entity40 confirmed that the previous search area was being abandoned on thursday , and discounted as the resting place of the missing airline			1
' the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and in its professional judgment , the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of @entity2 , ' the @entity40 said			2
a @entity8 survey ship has already begun mapping of the new ocean floor , expected to continue for the next three months the @entity55 ship @entity56 01 ( pictured ) and a @entity58 vessel , @entity59 6 , are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing in an interview with the @entity63 on friday however , deputy prime minister , @entity22 , confirmed that the search would continue despite the revelations			1
' we remain as a nation committed to the search , we remain determined to do everything we possibly can to find this aircraft , ' he said			0
' it 's our responsibility to the families of those who are involved , but also to assure the safety of the flying public into the future			0
' with the departure of @entity82 on friday , the new search for the aircraft or any debris is anticipated to begin in august and take up to 12 months			0
possible rings of location : these areas were determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between @entity2 and an @entity89 satellite the @entity82 departed the previous search area on friday after it was revealed that the acoustic ' pings ' whose data the search was based off , were unlikely to have been coming from the plane 's black - box a contracted survey vessel is set to join the @entity8 ship which is currently surveying the area alongside another @entity8 ship @entity56 01 and a @entity58 vessel @entity59 6 which are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing			1
satellite , radar and and aircraft performance data also continue to be reviewed separately to determine where the plane was most likely to have hit the water			2
seven of the so called ' handshake ' signals sent by the plane to an @entity89 satellite will be reanalyzed , as they are now determined to be the best indication of the planes final location points			0
the @entity121 satellite firm 's data , which contains signals sent by @entity2 will be reanalyzed @entity23 search authorities narrowed the search for the jet after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the @entity131 , some 1,600km off @entity23 's northwest coast the discovery of the pings on april 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough , leading @entity23 search authorities to narrow the search for the jet to some 1,600 km off @entity23 's northwest coast			2
but according to @entity137 , the @entity34 's deputy director of ocean engineering , authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders			2
he believes the pings instead came from some other man - made source unrelated to the jetliner which disappeared on march 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew			0
speaking to @entity146 , mr @entity137 said : ‘ our best theory at this point is that ( the pings were ) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the @entity153			0
’ 850 square kilometres of the ocean floor were scoured in search of the airline , but no sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history			1
authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence , including the loss of communications , suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from @entity171 to @entity172 .			0

a new search area , 800 kms long and 70 kms wide , is expected to be confirmed
a @entity8 survey ship has begun mapping the new area 's ocean floor
the data will determine the new technology required for the fresh search
the acoustic ' pings ' which the previous search had been based off , are believed to not have come from black box but from search equipment
