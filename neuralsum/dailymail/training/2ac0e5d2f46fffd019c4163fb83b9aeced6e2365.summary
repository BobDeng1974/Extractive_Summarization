by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor labour education spokesman @entity2 has been ticked off after his new history book was found to be riddled with errors - by his @entity6 rival @entity5			1
mr @entity2 , a professional historian , has boasted of his ' deep and sustained reading ' of history compared to the @entity10 's ‘ superficial understanding of the past ’			1
but the @entity12 mp , whose latest work - @entity13 that made an @entity14 - is set to be published next week , made at least 14 basic errors on dates , names and events according to a review of the book written by mr @entity5			1
historian and @entity12 shadow education spokesman @entity2 has written a new book on the @entity23			1
but his @entity6 rival @entity5 claims it is riddled with errors the embarrassing errors include calling the @entity27 the “ @entity28 ” , and getting the date of the repeal of the @entity31 wrong despite the string of errors in the book - for which mr @entity2 was paid £ 8,200 for writing according to the @entity35 ’ interests - mr @entity5 praises it in a review to be published in the @entity38 tomorrow			1
he says the book stands comparison with ' works by some of our finest historians ' and praises his rival ’s writing			2
' the author , who is my opposite number in the @entity50 , has produced a work of the very high standard i would have expected			2
' but mr @entity5 adds : ' it is not the case that the @entity55 and the @entity56 began in the late 1730s			1
they began in 1688 and 1701 respectively			2
' and the @entity31 were repealed in 1846 not 1844			2
it is to be hoped that these , and any other errors , can be corrected for what will no doubt be a highly successful paperback version of this otherwise exemplary read			2
' education secretary @entity5 praised his opposite number 's new work - but picked out 14 errors that could be corrected for the paperback version several other mistakes have been spotted by mr @entity5			1
the book makes a reference to @entity70 as ' perfidious @entity71 ' in 1744 - when the phrase did not become current for another 50 years			2
mr @entity2 also writes of a @entity23 general election in 1888 , yet there was no election that year			1
he claims that @entity76 , a @entity77 , expressed scepticism about whether the people of @entity80 would elect a black man , but this remark should have been attributed to the @entity84 lord @entity83			2
the @entity12 shadow education secretary joked : ' once again @entity5 's sub-editing skills can be put to good use			1
' according to the publishers , @entity89 , mr @entity2 's book details ' the final embers of the @entity23 ' through the legacy it has left behind ' in the lives and structures of the cities which it shaped '			1
' here @entity2 examines the stories and defining ideas of ten of the most important : @entity100 ; @entity101 ; @entity102 ; @entity103 ; @entity104 ; @entity105 ; @entity106 ; @entity107 ; @entity108 ; and twentieth - century @entity109			1
' mr @entity2 apparently rejects ' standard binary views of the @entity23 as " very good " or " very bad "			1
' instead he ' describes the complex processes of exchange and adaptation that collectively shaped the colonial experience - and transformed the culture , economy and identity of the @entity118 '			2
but a @entity6 source warned potential readers not to judge the book by its cover			2
he said : ' just like @entity12 ’s education policy , @entity2 is all style and no substance			1
he can boast all he likes about his " deep and sustained reading " of history , but none of that matters if he ca n’t get his facts right			1
' let ’s hope his publishers do n’t rub salt into his wounds by asking for a refund			0
it will come as no surprise , except perhaps to @entity2 himself , that polling shows he ’s the only @entity12 politician less appealing than @entity140			1
' one claim : ' a rolling succession of conflicts , beginning in the late 1730s , variously known as @entity143 ( or the @entity55 ) , @entity144 ( @entity56 ) … ' fact : it is not the case that the @entity55 and the @entity56 began in the late 1730s			0

three claim : ' in 1792 , the @entity102 - born politician and philosopher @entity156 , who would prove such a glittering critic of imperialism in the @entity160 … ' fact : @entity162 was well - known as a critic of imperialism well before 1792 – as he showed with his opening speech at the impeachment of @entity167 in 1788			0
four claim : ' the eponymous @entity168 on south @entity169 ( designed by @entity170 for the third @entity28 ) … ' fact : @entity170 was the architect for the third @entity27 , not the @entity28			0

@entity183 ’s achievement was to snatch it from under their nose in 1824 , declare it a @entity23 possession and then institute a new model of colonialism predicated on the virtuous effects of free trade			1
' fact : sir @entity183 did not just begin negotiations with @entity186 for @entity179 in 1819 , he concluded them in february of that year and the territory was secure in @entity23 hands from then , with its own constitution in 1823 – it was not snatched “ from under the nose ” of the @entity197 in 1824			1

eleven claim : ' spectacularly disproving the future @entity77 prime minister @entity76 ’s prediction that the people of @entity80 would never elect a ‘ black man ’ , … ' fact : it was the @entity83 not the @entity77 lord @entity76 who expressed scepticism about the electoral fortunes of a “ black man ”			0

thirteen claim : ' the roots of @entity246 ’s suburban efflorescence were variously cultural , economic and technological			0
its origins could be traced back to the @entity287 evangelical revival of the late eighteenth century … ' fact : @entity246 ’s @entity290 revival did not occur in the “ late eighteenth century ” – the two principal preachers of the ' @entity292 ' – @entity293 and @entity294 – established themselves in the 1730s and 1740s			0
