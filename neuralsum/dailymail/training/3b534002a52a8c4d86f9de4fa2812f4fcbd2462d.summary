by @entity0 one of @entity2 's top restaurants has revealed that it 's staff prepares for each service by scouring the internet for clues about their upcoming diners			1
@entity9 has been ranked among the best restaurants in @entity11 - and the world - since its opening in 1998 but they have continued to adapt and try to best the competition by virtually stalking their guests			1
this level of service comes with a price , however , as meals at the contemporary @entity22 restaurant regularly run upwards of $ 225 - per - person , not including wine			1
setting the scene : @entity9 , first opened in 1998 , has been known for its impeccable service as much as they are known fro their food @entity31 describes how maitre d ' @entity32 spends hours using @entity34 to find out as much about their guests before they step in the door to the @entity38 restaurant			1

if it 's an anniversary , roller tasks himself to try and figure out which anniversary			0
he looks to see if they are interested in wine - posting photos with wine glasses or any links to brands that they like			2

all the details : the menu changes daily based on the seasons and the tastes of the individual making every meal special : in addition to the standard courses on their tasting menu , they serve creative amuse bouche tasters to set the mood for the meal their waitstaff training process is known to be gruelling and even the most experienced servers who have managed other well - established restaurants are ordered to spend months on the most seemingly menial tasks			1
from polishing silver during nightly service to scooping out servings of granola that is gifted to diners in mason jars at the end of the meal , every tiny detail is granted the same level of importance as that of the actual interaction with guests			2
and even once the staff have ' graduated ' to the level where they are split into teams of four and granted the responsibility to watch over a section of seven or eight tables , maintenance checks continue to keep them on their toes			2
institution : the tasting menu - only restaurant was featured in @entity109 the waitstaff has a ' family meal ' before each service where sommelier @entity113 quizzes them about the 131 - page wine list			2
