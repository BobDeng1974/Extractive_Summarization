by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:46 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 10:21 est , 14 august 2012 the @entity4 military 's first hybrid airship took off on its maiden voyage last week , hovering above @entity6 in a successful test flight			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , a hybrid blimp that has been in development for years , took off on august 7 - and stayed in flight for about 90 minutes			1
the vehicle is largely based on the @entity13 , an advanced airship design refined over decades by @entity16 engineering firm @entity15 ( @entity17 )			2
airtime : the @entity8 hovered in the sky above @entity20 , @entity6 , for about 90 minutes on august 7 while it gets its lift from the lighter - than - air helium , multiple engines on board sustain flight and allow it to move while gathering information from the ground			1
the helium - filled aircraft was conceived by a team of @entity16 and @entity4 engineers with the goal of benefitting troops on the ground with valuable surveillance information			1
based at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity17 is a specialist in hybrid air vehicles , which fly using a combination of aerostatic and aerodynamic lift			1
the team at @entity15 has re-examined the basic principles behind @entity46 and applied modern technology and materials to this 100 year old concept			0
the construction of the @entity8 was a joint project between @entity17 and @entity4 defence firm @entity52			1
the radical reimagining of an airship has four propulsion units , and can be piloted into remote areas			0
' some ten years ago we built a 50 foot prototype and at some stage demonstrated this to a delegation of the @entity4 @entity62 , ' said @entity17 's business development director @entity63			2
' they were impressed and a few years later released a request for a long endurance surveillance vehicle , the requirements of which we are able to meet			0
' since surveillance programmes consist of multiple parts ( vehicle as platform , a selection of sensors to provide the data and an ongoing service provision to manage & maintain the vehicle , as well as turn data into intelligence ) we decided to team with @entity79			0
' the design can land on almost any surface - even snow capped mountains			0
the major new aircraft was built in just over 24 months since contract signature			0
@entity63 told @entity85 that 80 per cent of the total cost of the vehicle was sourced in the @entity16			0
' that is something @entity15 is very proud of , ' he added			0
the @entity8 , which looks like a football but is as large as a football field , is n't your grandfather 's military airship			2
the aircraft boasts a ton of high - tech gear to compliment the massive helium filled blimp , including sensors to beam information to troops on the ground , and to move heavy equipment			2
the airship is based on a design that could eventually be used around the world as a freight and passenger it also has endurance , and can stay afloat above a battlefield or insurgent hotspot for up to 21 days - at a fraction of the cost of other military options			1
in a statement , the @entity116 said the @entity8 ' is intended to be used to conduct long - term intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance , or @entity121 , and persistent stare - type missions , and can also be used as a communications relay			2
' developed by : @entity15 and @entity52 top altitude : about 22,000 feet flight sustainability : up to 21 days speed : about 92 miles per hour the @entity8 , which took off from @entity6 ’s @entity128 - @entity20 base , was piloted for the test flight , but has the ability to function as an unmanned vehicle			1
it can float at an altitude of about 22,000 feet , and can travel at about 92 mph			0
the @entity8 ’s strong skin - a blend of @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 - can endure a reasonable amount of small arms fire from enemies on the ground			2
the construction of the @entity8 was a joint project by @entity16 engineering firm @entity15 and @entity4 defence firm @entity52			1
@entity20 , where the @entity8 took flight , is no stranger to airships			1
the base is also the site where the @entity149 crashed in 1937			0
the @entity116 says it will conduct more flights after the craft undergoes an inspection			0
historic : @entity20 , where the @entity8 took flight , is no stranger to airships			1
the base is also the site where the @entity149 crashed in 1937 watch video here			0

@entity8 ( @entity8 ) takes off and hovers over @entity20 , @entity6 - the site of the 1937 @entity162 *disaster*
hybrid military craft can stay in the air for up to 21 days - and can be either manned or unmanned
gets lift from helium , but can also move with the aid of engines
developed by joint team of @entity4 and @entity16 engineers
