by @entity0 there ’s no need to worry about being caught short on this particular walking tour of @entity4			1
the ‘ @entity11 ’ sees walkers shepherded round a selection of toilets in the capital being given the lowdown on the best places to go			1
conceived by @entity14 guide @entity12 , who was so frustrated by not being able to ' pee for free ' , the not so bog standard tour takes curious loo finders from all over the world and guides them around a variety of toilets and areas relating to sewerage history in the capital			1
the most patriotic loos ever ? the @entity25 not only have @entity27 toilet seats but attendants with @entity27 waistcoats too close your eyes and think of the queen : the ' @entity34 ' success is probably down to the fact that they are so well - cared for the tour starts at the toilets by platform 19 at @entity40 ( geddit ? ) and can accommodate up to 20 guests while @entity12 also offers ' singles ' and private tours			1
each tour is packed with unusual and little - known facts like brief histories on how the @entity46 managed their toilet , and the plumber who founded one of @entity4 ’s early sanitary engineering companies , @entity48 and co. weaving through the streets , walkers visit such locations as the patriotic ' @entity55 ' on the @entity56			1
built for the @entity58 and designed by architect @entity59 , the toilet costs 50p to use and has full - time attendants who are hard to miss in their @entity27 waistcoats			0
it also makes use of rainwater to flush toilets and wash floors			2
next the whislte - stop tour takes people to the day urinals for men in @entity71 and pop - up urinals in @entity71			2
the magic circle : the ' @entity74 ' rises from the ground in the evenings to encourage men out on the town not to relieve themselves on the streets you 're in trouble now : the men only , pop - up ' @entity85 ' urinals in @entity71 are a stainless steel design - but not so private just around the corner outside @entity88 is the mysterious ' @entity74 ' – one of three urinals provided by @entity91 that rise up from the ground in the evenings to offer an alternative option for late - night male revellers			0
the @entity74 contributes to keeping 10,000 gallons of wee off the streets of @entity91 , explains @entity12			0
another , more permanent example of a street urinal is the @entity85 outside @entity71			0
its slick stainless steel design aims to please , with a view to prevent men weeing on the street - albeit with minimal privacy			0
the guide has a wealth of stories about the history of public conveniences , for example the difficulties of providing public conveniences for women in the @entity115			0
toilet humour required ? @entity12 gives tourists the lowdown on loos in her deadpan style pee on earth : @entity40 is well - catered for when it comes to the smallest room : platform 19 ladies toilets , left , are a favourite , while @entity128 community toilets at @entity40 , right			1
are for those in the know get to the bottom of it : the enthusiastic tour guide takes interested parties through the back streets of @entity4 , dispensing historical information about the loos of @entity4 loo within a loo : the @entity141 cocktail bar in @entity142 used to be a mens toilet frequented by @entity144 female toilets were highly controversial , indeed many people thought they were an ‘ abomination ’ and would be used by flower girls cleaning their watercress apparently			1
the most successful were the ones that were discreetly located underground			0
toilets for gentlemen were far more common and the underground toilets at @entity154 ’s , @entity155 are included in the tour , as are the gentleman ’s loos at the @entity159 - which even had a sonnet dedicated to them			1
pull up a stool : @entity4 's only @entity163 was a gas lamp powered solely by sewerage gas toilet hero : the monument to @entity168 , who designed the first sewerage system for @entity4 on @entity170 also on the agenda is a stop at a lamp near to the @entity175 hotel which was powered by gas from the sewerage system in @entity4 almost a century ago			2
the walk concludes at the end of the @entity179 at underground toilets regularly frequented by @entity144 that have now been converted into a cocktail bar			2
other pub stops include a @entity184 participant ; @entity185 is one of 75 establishments paid £ 600 each year by the @entity188 to cater for people 's basic needs			0
when you consider that the average person spends about an average of a year and a half on the toilet , perhaps you wo n't be so quick to pooh pooh the tour .			0
