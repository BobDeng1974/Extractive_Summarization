by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 captain @entity2 insists the team will not become obsessed by the prospect of another @entity7 penalty shoot - out			1
exiting six of their last 10 major tournaments on penalties means there is an undercurrent of trepidation that @entity2 understands			2
the defeat to @entity16 in the @entity18 semi-finals began a nightmare run of spot - kick defeats that last struck at @entity21			1
back of the mind : @entity2 insists @entity3 will not become obsessed by the prospect of penalties heartache : @entity2 missed a penalty during the @entity7 defeat against @entity28 back in 2006 @entity2 netted two years ago as @entity3 exited to @entity29 , but six years earlier the @entity3 skipper saw his penalty saved in the @entity7 quarter - final exit to @entity28			1
' it 's difficult to describe what it is like , ' @entity2 told @entity36			0
' unfortunately for me i failed in that situation when i took a penalty in a @entity7 environment and it was a difficult atmosphere to be in			0
' i learnt my lessons from that and a couple of years ago i scored the penalty i was asked to take			0
' we are going to practise penalties a lot but it is a difficult situation to put into words and describe it			0
there is a lot of pressure			0
' you have an awful lot more time to think about your penalty and what is at stake is a lot bigger and it is a pressure situation			0
' a penalty shoot - out is a more pressurised situation than any one penalty in a league game			1
' so that 's what i hit ? @entity64 talks to club skipper @entity2 during a training session in @entity67 train hard : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity72 warm - up before a session in @entity74 @entity3 last won a penalty shoot - out at a major tournament during @entity77 but the current squad have been working hard to prepare for the situation occurring in @entity80			1
@entity81 has brought sports psychiatrist dr @entity82 away with the team and the players have been working hard in training to avoid such issues this summer			0
' i can understand the fixation because we have failed in quite a few shoot - outs but i would say do n't get carried away with it because it might never come about , ' @entity2 added			1
' as players hopefully we perform well enough in 90 minutes or 120 minutes to prevent it going to a shoot - out			2
but we will be ready for a shoot - out if it comes around			2
