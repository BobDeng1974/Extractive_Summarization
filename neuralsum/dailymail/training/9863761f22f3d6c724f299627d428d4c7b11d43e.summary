by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 13:35 est , 19 march 2014 conventional wisdom has us believe that those at the lower end of the intelligence spectrum are more unguarded and trusting , but this is apparently not the case			0
it is those with a higher iq who are in fact likely to be more trusting of others according to new research			2
and being more trusting of others not only benefits society in general , but tends to make the individual happier and healthier , researchers at the @entity18 found			1
brainy people are more likely to trust other people , maybe because they are able to better discern who will betray them published in the journal , @entity27 , the study was based on an analysis of the @entity29 , a nationally representative public opinion survey carried out in the @entity31 every one to two years			1
they found that higher iq was linked with a greater sense of trust in others and society and suggest that intelligence may include a higher ability to judge character			1
this would explain the findings as those with a higher iq would be less likely to betray people who will betray them , and so develop a greater faith in others			2
many studies have linked trust with all manner of positive traits for the individual including entrepreneurship , volunteering , self - rated health , and happiness lead author @entity53 said : ‘ intelligence is shown to be linked with trusting others , even after taking into account factors like marital status , education and income			0
this finding supports what other researchers have argued , namely that being a good judge of character is a distinct part of human intelligence which evolved through natural selection			0
’ many previous studies have linked what is termed generalised trust – a sense of confidence and belief in society and the world around you - with all manner of positive traits for the individual including entrepreneurship , volunteering , self - rated health , and happiness			0
the researchers also found this link , but found that trust was beneficial for people regardless of their level of intelligence			1
it seems that developing faith in people is likely to help you feel and do better in life , even if you ’re no @entity88 .			0

research from @entity18 found link between iq and trust
findings analysed from the @entity29 - done across @entity31
suggest link may because *clever* people can better judge character
