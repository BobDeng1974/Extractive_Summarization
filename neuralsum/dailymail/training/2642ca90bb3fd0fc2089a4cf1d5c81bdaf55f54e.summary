two senior @entity1 approached @entity2 last year to ask whether he would consider taking over from @entity3 , it emerged last night			1
@entity4 and @entity5 contacted the former home secretary in the autumn to see if he wanted to replace mr @entity3 as @entity9 leader , according to the @entity10			1
both men have been forced to deny they encouraged mr @entity2 to put himself forward as @entity9 leader when mr @entity3 's leadership hit rock bottom in november last year			1
@entity4 and @entity5 held talks with @entity2 amid growing speculation that he would take the helm of the party to prevent a second election defeat mr @entity2 has ruled out ever standing for the @entity9 leadership , to the dismay of his many supporters in the party the @entity10 reported that former business secretary @entity4 and @entity9 spin doctor mr @entity5 approached mr @entity2 to see whether he would be interested in replacing the hapless mr @entity3 as leader			1
according to one labour mp , mr @entity2 gave an ' emphatic no ' – as he has in public			1
but it was seen as a sign of the growing sense of desperation in the @entity17 in the wake of mr @entity3 's disastrous party conference speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit			1
mr @entity2 served in the @entity34 for six years and was seen as a safe pair of hands , popular with the media and the public			1
after mr @entity3 won the @entity9 leadership he appointed mr @entity39 as shadow chancellor , but he remained in post for just three months , resigning after revelations about his wife having an affair			1
however , many still view the former postman and trade union leader as a possible caretaker leader if mr @entity3 's woeful personal ratings risked prevent @entity9 winning the election			1
labour leader @entity3 has come under fresh pressure in recent days over mounting criticism from business leaders @entity54 , former @entity55 chairman : ' @entity9 's attack this week on a major @entity58 business smacked of the destructive anti-business mood that went out of political fashion decades ago			1
' lord @entity61 , former @entity9 trade minister : ' it 's a much bigger problem with business			2
i think that they 're scraping the bottom of the barrel ... they have n't got the support that @entity9 used to have years ago			0
' yo ! sushi founder @entity70 , who once appeared in a @entity17 advert : ' you know it scares me			0
i was a @entity17 supporter during the @entity75 thing and i was a supporter because i am a believer that politics needs to make money , that @entity79 needs to be a profitable business , and i thought they were a good management team			0
' @entity81 founder @entity39 : ' take freezing energy prices – an example of how the @entity84 are ignorant of the way markets and capitalism works			0
' @entity88 , co-founder of @entity89 : ' @entity90 get elected then what we may well find is that it will be similar to what @entity94 did in @entity96 , in that he sends businesses away and investment out of the country and then he does a u-turn and it 's almost too late			2
' @entity101 , founder @entity102 : ' i 'm one business owner who is n't going to keep quiet about the destructive power of having a business - hating government with @entity3 at the helm			1
' boots chief @entity109 said : ' if they acted as they speak , it would be a catastrophe			0
the problem is , would they act that way or not ? one thing is to threaten and to shout , but it is completely different to be in charge and to manage the country day to day			0
' new @entity9 supporters were seen as being closer to mr @entity3 's brother @entity122 , but he stepped down as an mp after losing the leadership against to his brother			1
at least 40 @entity126 are believed to have backed the abortive coup , which occurred weeks after the @entity129 's conference speech last autumn			1
the @entity10 article said that the paper had learned that ' two @entity9 grandees — @entity4 , the former business secretary , and @entity5 , @entity135 's former press chief — took soundings from @entity2 to see whether he was prepared to take over			1
' @entity2 gave an emphatic no , ' says one labour mp			2
another senior party figure claimed that at least 40 mps supported the abortive coup — others claim far more			0
' tensions between mr @entity3 and new @entity9 grandees have been renewed in recent days , after losing the support of business leaders seen as crucial to mr @entity135 's three election triumphs			1
however , @entity4 today insisted he had not encouraged mr @entity2 to challenge mr @entity3 , but only asked if rumours about him standing were true			1
he said : ' as he is a good friend of mine , we talked about the press frenzy going on at the time and he said it was all nonsense			0
end of conversation , end of story			0
' a @entity9 spokesman for the @entity17 said the story was ' false and misleading '			0
' this story is nonsense , ' he said			0
' both @entity4 and @entity5 have made it crystal clear to the ft that they spoke to @entity2 only to see if the newspaper rumours were correct			1
' they were not sounding him out or encouraging him to stand but checking the accuracy of reports in the press			2
they discovered that those reports were false and misleading , just as is today 's story in the @entity10 ' but @entity165 mp @entity164 said : ' six months out from the @entity166 those at the highest levels of the @entity17 were plotting to remove @entity3			1
' this just proves @entity3 is not up to the job of being @entity171 and his own party knows it			2
@entity3 in @entity174 would spell chaos for @entity58			2
' the leadership speculation comes at the end of a week when captains of industry and entrepreneurs have lined up to warn against a @entity9 victory			0
business leaders credited with the success of well - known chains including boots , @entity55 , @entity81 and @entity89 have turned their fire on @entity9 in recent days , warning victory for mr @entity3 would plunge @entity58 into an economic catastrophe			2
sir @entity188 , who was one of 63 signatories to a letter of support for @entity9 in 2005 , told the @entity10 the business community felt ' isolated ' by @entity9 's shift to the left			2
' as a business person i 'm frightened of an environment where there is n't sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts to spend more money , ' he said			0
however , @entity203 , formerly @entity135 's chief fundraiser who helped @entity9 form close ties with business , said he was ' saddened ' by the attacks on mr @entity3			1
he insisted that he had not given up on @entity9 working with business under mr @entity3 and attempted to play down the damage caused by attacks from leaders of large firms and shadow chancellor @entity216 's televised memory lapse over the name of the party 's small business adviser @entity218			1
the peer told @entity221 's @entity222 : ' i 'm somewhat saddened that people like sir @entity188 , whom i have great respect for , has said what he has said			2
' @entity216 , obviously , no one likes to have a touch of amnesia and forgetting @entity218 's name was one of those things that happened			0
' but really the key issue is where does @entity9 stand with business			0
frankly i do n't think any political party can ignore business , they have to work with business , they have to work with a broad spectrum of society			0
' businesses will today be promised a £ 10billion boost by cutting red tape in the conservative manifesto as the party seeks to exploit @entity9 ’s damaging row with captains of industry			0
in an interview with the @entity251 , business minister @entity249 set out plans to cut red tape , saving firms an average of £ 2,000 a year			0
he also signalled the party is preparing to offer tax breaks to start - up companies taking on their first employees and further steps to rein in vexatious employment tribunal claims			0
mr @entity249 said the @entity261 would go into the election as ‘ unashamedly pro-business and pro-enterprise ’ , committing to more deregulation			0
a review of each sector will take place this year if the @entity261 remain in power , and @entity271 departments made to implement a ‘ one in , two out ’ rule whenever they introduce any new regulation			0
his announcement came as @entity9 has been embroiled in a business row , after @entity3 turned on the boss of boots when he expressed alarm at the prospect of the party regaining power .			2
