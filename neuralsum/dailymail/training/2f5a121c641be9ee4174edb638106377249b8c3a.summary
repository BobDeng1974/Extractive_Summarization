by @entity1 reporter published : 17:35 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 18:09 est , 1 march 2013 @entity2 apparently ' threw a fit ' when she saw a photo of the dress @entity6 would be wearing to the @entity7			2
the @entity9 star , who won the @entity10 , had planned to wear a gown by her good friend @entity12 , but changed her mind after @entity14 shared an @entity16 snap of her own @entity18 creation - which was very similar - during a rehearsal			1
' @entity2 was like , " wtf ? " ' a source told @entity21			0
' she started throwing a fit ! ' given the cold shoulder : @entity2 decided last - minute to wear @entity24 to the @entity7 , despite being expected to wear a custom - made gown by her long - time favorite designer and friend , @entity12 the scene left @entity14 , 27 , ' ruffled ' , the source continued			1
' @entity6 did n't want to deal with it and left , ' they said			0
to her credit , ms @entity2 , 30 , did not try to persuade her fellow actress to change her dress , ' they added , instead taking it upon herself to address the situation			0
' @entity2 made the fashion , make - up , hair , and jewelry teams wait at her home for hours as she decided what to do about the dress debacle ' the decision backfired on her though , with her stylists and beauty teams objecting to the wait as she agonized with stylist @entity50 over the selection of a new gown , a second source told @entity21			2
' @entity2 made the fashion , make - up , hair , and jewelry teams wait at her home for hours as she decided what to do about the dress debacle , ' they said			2
and after trading her planned @entity12 gown for a pale pink @entity24 creation , she was forced to issue a public statement by way of apology to @entity12 , whose press team had already sent out a press release announcing her choice , unaware of the last - minute switch			1
too similar ? ms @entity2 's decision was prompted when @entity6 ( left ) shared a photo of her @entity18 gown , which was very like her chosen @entity12 number ( right ) in a statement issued to @entity76 , she explained : ' it came to my attention late saturday night that there would be a dress worn to the @entity7 that is remarkably similar to the @entity12 i had intended to wear , and so i decided it was best for all involved to change my plans			1
' she insisted that the trade was not intended as a snub to @entity12 , who designed the wedding gown she wore to marry husband @entity87 last september			0
' though i love the dress i did wear , it was a difficult last minute decision as i had so looked forward to wearing @entity12 in honor of the deep and meaningful relationship i have enjoyed with the house and with @entity12 himself , ' she continued			0
memorable fashion moment : @entity12 designed the romantic pale pink gown and headpiece that ms @entity2 wore to marry @entity87 last september ' i deeply regret any disappointment caused			1
' ms @entity2 first made reference to the gown switch when interviewed by @entity100 on the red carpet on sunday			2
' i did n't know what i was wearing until about three hours ago , ' she told him			0
' this was the one that spoke to me in the end			0
' her dress choice undoubtedly came as a surprise to @entity12 , whose fashion house sent out a press release just before the awards show stating that it would be dressing @entity2 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
close friends : @entity12 ( pictured with ms @entity2 in one of his designs at the @entity7 ) has said that the actress is ' like my daughter ' the actress certainly caused a stir in her backless pink satin @entity24 gown - complete with a very perky bust line - which she accessorized with a sparkling @entity126 necklace			1
ms @entity2 has a long history of friendship with 80 - year - old @entity12 , who has said of the actress : ' she 's a very good friend of mine			1
she 's like my daughter			0
' she has worn a number of his creations to awards ceremonies - including the bold red strapless number she wore to host the @entity7 in 2011 .			0

@entity2 shunned the gown made for her by good friend @entity12 in favor of pale pink @entity24 after seeing an @entity16 snap of @entity6 's @entity18 dress
