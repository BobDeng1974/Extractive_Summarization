the car that hairdresser @entity10 , 52 , was in was struck by a passenger train at 61mph and dragged 150 yards down the track			1
a jury was told that moments before the crash , signalman @entity16 ‘ panicked ’ when a local farmer called for a second time seeking clearance to guide his sheep over another crossing further up the track			1
tragedy : @entity10 was hit while crossing the track by car after @entity16 lifted the barriers too early while he was distracted , @entity16 lifted the barriers , believing the @entity28 to @entity30 train had already passed the crossing , the court heard			1
@entity16 , 43 , only realised his fatal mistake when he saw it approaching at 80mph around a corner – and frantically tried to lower the barriers and change the signal at the @entity38 , @entity39 , crossing			2
mrs @entity10 ’s husband , @entity40 , who was driving their @entity41 , survived the incident with shoulder and pelvic injuries			1
@entity47 @entity46 heard that although human error was a factor in the crash , the tragedy could have been prevented if @entity52 had not declined to spend £ 40,000 on a simple safety device which could stop signals being changed when a train was approaching			1

mr @entity70 added : ‘ @entity52 took the decision not to install this device because it would cost £ 40,000 – that device could have saved a life			1
‘ an approach - locking system has been around since the 1960s and can be used to stop signals being changed when trains are still coming through			0
in 2009 there was quite a lot of work done at the @entity38 crossing and the barriers were replaced			0
there were discussions to have an approach - locking device which were rejected			2
why not put in this device ? the reason was money			2
was the cost too great to avoid the cost of a human life ? ’ in a police interview in january 2010 , @entity16 said he lifted the barriers because he thought the train had already passed as cars were waiting at the crossing			1
but train driver @entity99 had too little time to slow down and struck the @entity102 ’ @entity101 and a second vehicle , a @entity104			0
