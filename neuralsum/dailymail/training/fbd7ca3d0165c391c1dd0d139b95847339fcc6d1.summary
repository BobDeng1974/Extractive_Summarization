by @entity0 pounds to @entity2 sent people emails ahead of their birthdays offering to loan them money to fund their celebrations an email advert from payday lender pounds to @entity2 has been banned for encouraging customers to use a short - term loan to fund their birthday celebrations			1
the email arrived with a subject line reading ' @entity14 from pounds to @entity2 ' and went on to say : ' we ’d like to wish you the best on your special day ! now you can apply for the money you need to enjoy your birthday worry - free			1
' the @entity24 charity complained that the ad promoted a casual ' worry - free ' attitude to taking out a short - term loan and irresponsibly encouraged consumers to use the money to fund birthday parties			1
@entity31 , trading as @entity1 to @entity2 , acknowledged that taking out a short - term loan was a matter for serious consideration but said it went to ' great lengths ' to ensure ads were not targeted at ' inappropriate ' individuals , such as children			0
it said the point of the birthday promotion was to show customers that their business was valued			2
but after an investigation by watchdog the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) the lender said it would remove the email from circulation			2
the @entity50 noted that a 20 % discount was offered on a first scheduled payment for those who applied on the day the email was received , and the funds would be sent within 10 minutes if approved			0
ruling that the ad must not appear again in its current form , the @entity45 said : ' while possibly desirable , having money to spend on birthday celebrations was unlikely to be seen as essential , and by encouraging recipients to take advantage of the service through a special offer discount for immediate application , pounds to @entity2 had urged a decision , thereby limiting the amount of time those interested in a loan were able to give to proper consideration			2
@entity69 of the @entity24 said it was irresponsible for the firm to market loans as ' worry - free ' ' we concluded that the email was irresponsible because it encouraged taking a short - term loan for frivolous spending and promoted the process of borrowing as trivial and without responsibility			1
' citizens advice chief executive @entity69 said : ' payday loans can add to financial worries , not take them away			0
it is irresponsible for any lender to promote a casual attitude to borrowing by suggesting using loans are worry - free and can be used to fund celebrations			1
' @entity24 helps thousands of people each year who have been landed in debt because lenders failed to carry out checks to assess whether people can afford to repay			0
' the @entity45 ’s decision to ban this advert sends a strong message to other payday lenders that this type of marketing is irresponsible and not appropriate			0
' campaigners hope the @entity44 ruling will curb marketing by payday lenders			0
