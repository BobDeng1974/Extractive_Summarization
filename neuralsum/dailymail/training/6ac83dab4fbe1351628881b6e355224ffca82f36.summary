what to do with a problem like @entity2 ? the @entity3 could probably play in as many as five different positions in a 4 - 3 - 3 and at least three in a 4 - 4 - 2 but at times his versatility becomes his own worse enemy as coaches fail to settle on his best position			1
ask @entity10 where he is best suited and he ’ll say on the left of a middle three in a 4 - 3 - 3 where he excelled for @entity16 last season			1
ask @entity19 coach @entity18 and he will say he ’s best in a front three where he caused havoc against @entity22 in a friendly earlier in the season			0
his versatility was his salvation at the @entity25			0
he had established himself as a right winger but when £ 86million man @entity28 came in to take that position , @entity27 reinvented himself as a box - to - box midfielder and finished the campaign as arguably @entity16 ’s best player			1
@entity2 will line up for @entity19 on tuesday night in their friendly against @entity35 at @entity36 the £ 60million winger shares a joke with @entity39 and @entity19 defender @entity40 he still has all the attributes to play on the right wing ; to hug the touchline and then come inside and shoot with his left foot			1
he can also play on the left wing and @entity46 even had him down as a potential emergency left back such is ability to gallop up and down the flank			0
but last season with @entity28 breathing down his neck for the right - wing position and @entity27 slotted into a more central berth for @entity10 and was a revelation playing on the left of a three that also included @entity57 and @entity58			1
@entity10 ’s decision to use him in midfield was bold			0
@entity27 had operated there before for @entity62 but there were questions over whether he had the tactical intelligence and the positional discipline to work in the position			2
he knew exactly when to cover the forward forays of @entity70 or @entity71 – @entity16 ’s two left backs – and he also knew when , instead of covering the overlapping full back , he himself needed to overlap			2
@entity27 exploded on to the scene at @entity77 , pictured here celebrating his goal against @entity79 in september but the winger has gone off the boil in recent matches and has failed to score in his last four outings @entity27 has played further forward in recent games for @entity77 and has n't had the same effect as he did in the early part of his career at @entity77 - here he is pictured celebrating against @entity79 in september @entity88 started games on the left flank but was never going to stay there for 90 minutes and @entity27 had to know that he could sprint into that unoccupied space down the left when @entity88 was in a more central position			1
he did exactly that in @entity96 final when his cross-shot led to @entity28 ’s goal			0
the midfield transformation worked better than anyone , even @entity10 , could have dreamed			0
@entity27 was that modern football marvel – two players in one			2
much like @entity102 in his prime at @entity104 , who appeared to be playing as a right winger and a right back at the same time , @entity27 was playing as a back - tracking left - sided midfielder in a middle three and a left winger in a front three			2
when @entity77 signed him at the start of the season it was no surprise that @entity114 slotted him straight into that same position			1
and his first performances for @entity77 were evidence of just how well he plays the position			0
@entity27 was up and down the left wing during his first @entity77 start , against @entity121 he had less of an impact in @entity77 's last match against @entity124 and was taken off after 71 minutes @entity27 played more than 50 times for @entity16 before representing @entity19 at the @entity126 in @entity127 following @entity28 's arrival at @entity16 , @entity27 switched flanks and enjoyed great success @entity27 was one of @entity16 's best players last season but there is always the temptation to put such a @entity136 - style player further forward where he can play without the defensive responsibilities of a winger			1
in @entity19 ’s friendly against @entity22 earlier in the season he roamed with intent across the front three and scored in a man - of - the - match performance in a 4 - 2 win			0
his country are likely to use him in a similar position on tuesday			0
if he ’s a success for @entity19 in the front three and was @entity16 ’s best player last season in a middle three where does that leave @entity150 ? the @entity152 coach also has one other nagging doubt at the back of his mind : is it not the case that more than positional confuse @entity27 is suffering from fatigue ? few players go through the gears so intensely out on the pitch and the @entity3 has been playing ‘ pedal to the floor ’ since the start of last season			1
he needed a super-human effort to keep himself in the team and he delivered it			0
he ended up playing in 52 of @entity16 ’s 60 matches last season			1
he then followed it up with a physically exhausting @entity126 and was then thrown straight into a move to a new country and a new league with all the physical and mental demands that that brings			2
it maybe that as well as a little dazed and confused from switching positions , he ’s also just plain tired .			0

record signing @entity27 started the season well but has gone off the boil
he has been used in a variety of positions by @entity114 this season
@entity3 will line up for *national* side against @entity35 at @entity36
@entity27 played 52 of @entity16 's 60 matches last term before playing in the @entity126 and then *sealing* a move to @entity77 *...* is he just exhausted ?
