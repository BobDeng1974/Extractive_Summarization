by @entity0 published : 14:18 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 17:10 est , 12 june 2012 @entity1 is jumping on the bacon bandwagon , and is now offering the meaty treat in the most unlikely of places – an ice - cream sundae			1
the sundae – vanilla soft serve drizzled with fudge , caramel , bacon crumbles and a piece of ‘ thick - cut bacon ’ - started in @entity13 , @entity14 earlier this year and today launched nationwide			2
however , the news is n’t all good ; the dessert packs a caloric punch , with 510 calories , 18 grams of fat , and 61 grams of sugar			1
piggy pudding : @entity1 has introduced a bacon sundae as part of its new menu items for the summer ; it packs a caloric punch and has 61g sugar and then there ’s the rest of @entity1 ’s summer menu			1
the world 's second biggest hamburger chain is also launching several pork , beef and chicken sandwiches as limited time offers to go with the bacon sundae			1
the items are @entity1 's latest push to win back customers with a revived menu and reverse sliding market share , an effort that started soon after the company was taken private by the private equity firm @entity44 in late 2010			1
earlier this year , @entity1 launched its biggest - ever menu expansion including fruit smoothies , snack wraps and new salads			1
the items were intended to go after a broader audience of moms and families , a shift from the chain 's previous strategy of courting young men with calorie bombs			0
summer special : @entity1 is also offering other summer specials , including bbq sandwiches and @entity61 core menu items , such as @entity64 fries and the @entity65 , have also been tweaked as part of the company 's efforts to improve food quality			1
@entity1 is trying to underscore its own focus on ingredients with a new tag line , ‘ @entity73 , ’ which replaces ‘ @entity1			2
’ a new ad has been celebrating summer barbecues to highlight the chain 's emphasis on fire - grilling burgers			0
the new summer items will be featured in ads starting thursday			0
this month , @entity44 plans to take @entity1 public on the @entity82			2
@entity83 is also revamping its menu to improve ingredients and recast itself as a higher - end burger chain			0
the makeovers by the hamburger giants come at a time when the traditional fast - food chains are seeing more competition from smaller players such as @entity93 and @entity94 that offer higher - quality food , and more health - conscious alternatives such as @entity98			0
@entity1 is n't the only fast - food chain that 's trying to draw attention with unusual offerings			2
@entity102 earlier this year introduced its tacos with @entity105 shells and a ‘ nacho burrito ’ that includes corn chips			0
and bacon desserts are hardly anything new			0
many non-chain restaurants across the country offer some combination of ice cream and the salty , fatty meat , from milkshakes to sundaes and everything in between .			0
