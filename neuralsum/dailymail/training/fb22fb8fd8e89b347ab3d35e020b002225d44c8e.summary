it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			2
what 's hot @entity5 sir @entity6 was persistently irritated by @entity5 , which is one of the many reasons to quite like them			1
set up in opposition to the @entity12 takeover at the other @entity5 in 2005 , the club has moved steadily up the non-league pyramid , has a new Â£ 5million stadium on the horizon and has now announced a remarkable friendly against @entity17 in may to mark its ten - year anniversary			1
proof that there is another way to enjoy football after all			2
@entity5 will play fellow fan - owned club @entity17 to celebrate their 10th birthday the match will take place at their new stadium , which will be opened in may this year @entity30 and @entity31 @entity32 appeared on @entity33 last saturday wearing a dubious tie and looking as though he 's not unfamiliar with the odd night at @entity36 's best curry houses			1
and who is to say he is n't entitled ? he and the more reserved @entity38 are joint chairmen of @entity36			2
their money saved the club from extinction in 2002 and they will never get it back			2
now , though , the two have a @entity46 final and a win at @entity48 to reflect on			1
@entity36 joint chairman @entity32 helped save the club from extinction back in 2002 the @entity50 some idealists - including @entity53 legend @entity52 and my own father - refuse to watch @entity57 cricket , deriding it as a betrayal of the sport 's very fundamentals			1
but consider this : if you ca n't perform two of cricket 's three basic skills ( bowl , bat or field ) very well then you wo n't even get a game			2
@entity72 's annual shindig is competitive , skilful and does n't carry passengers			0
if you do n't think it 's proper cricket then you are n't watching closely enough			0
@entity76 ( right ) has impressed for the @entity77 in @entity72 's @entity50 what 's not @entity79 deep in to @entity48 's riveting clash with @entity82 on tuesday , home full - back @entity84 was seen shaking hands with the match referee after being booked			1
it seemed a peculiar business but on reflection seems entirely appropriate			0
@entity84 was clearly congratulating @entity79 on making his first correct decision of the night			1
one more stamp from ( @entity93 ) @entity92 and @entity94 would have qualified for a free cappuccino			0
@entity79 ( centre ) was at the centre of a controverisla game between @entity82 and @entity48 @entity99 sleeping on a plane - first class or at the back - is nothing like being in your own bed			1
but then , to some , the @entity104 is nothing like the @entity106			0
so maybe that was why the @entity109 manager scheduled his players to fly back from @entity111 less than 24 hours before they played - and lost - against @entity112 last weekend			1
let 's hope the in - flight movies were worth it			2
@entity99 came underfire for flying back from @entity111 less than 24 hours before an @entity104 game @entity117 we wish the 27 - year - old well in the @entity121 final on saturday against @entity122			1
more so , we hope the ensuing phone chat with father @entity124 goes ok			0
@entity125 used to be his daughter 's rather volatile coach			0
now he skis while she plays and shouts if she loses , offering us a depressing insight in to the women 's tour we would rather not see			0
' i like honesty , i appreciate that , ' said @entity125			0
yes , @entity135 , of course you do			0
@entity117 will take on @entity122 in the @entity121 final on saturday			0

@entity5 will take on @entity17 in may to mark ten - year anniversary
@entity79 came under fire for *performance* during @entity48 v @entity82
@entity109 flew back from less than 24 hours before @entity112 game
