by @entity0 @entity1 talked previously about the @entity3 ’s ‘ willingness to suffer ’ in this @entity4			0
few took him as literally as things played out on monday night			0
the @entity6 secured a dramatic 2 - 1 win against @entity8 - the team that has bested them at every level they ’ve played competitively since they knocked them out of the group stage back in 2006			1
embrace : @entity16 hugs his players after @entity3 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity8 @entity19 : @entity20 ( left ) heading the winner for his side in the closing stages @entity24 : the former striker celebrating their dramatic late winner against the @entity8 in many ways , the game last night was a reverse of the 2010 match			1
in that one , the @entity6 dictated the play to the @entity8 but did n’t finish their chances			0
on thursday , @entity8 were the aggressor , creating 20 shots to the @entity6 ’s seven , but could only once find the back of the net			0
@entity6 manager @entity16 has talked incessantly about changing the @entity6 soccer system and play technically but for all the rhetoric the @entity6 did not control the match last night save for the opening salvo			1
@entity42 attacked @entity8 's right back flank and in goal worthy of questioning , ' why @entity46 for @entity47 ? ' pinged a low liner in off the far post after introducing @entity8 centerback @entity50 to his jet stream			0
@entity52 , as most teams do , got tentative after taking the lead and were forced to do so further when @entity55 pulled his hamstring sprinting for an over-the - top ball			1
the injury and substitution exacerbated a major flaw in @entity16 ’s squad selection : no back - up target man			0
torn apart : @entity55 grimaces after pulling his hamstring during the game banged : @entity42 floored after being kicked in the face the @entity6 - as has been often the case under @entity16 opted for a pragmatic and conservative approach - unable to hold the ball up the field and unwilling to open up their rear guard through swift counterattacking			1
it was a painful watch for @entity6 fans as the @entity6 seemed to go into ' hold on ' mode in the 23 ’			2
a trading of goals in the closing stages kept the scoreline in the @entity6 favor but the @entity6 ’s preparation - the @entity6 used two subs before the 46th minute from non-contact muscle strains - and tactics - an inability to re-purpose the ball to their more dangerous right flank , and the absence of a simple adjustment of moving a striker over a fullback in an attempt to win more outlet duels - should be questioned			2
at the end of the day it was some simple @entity95 fundamentals that @entity16 instilled early in his coaching tenure - specifically playing a simple holder than many questioned and moving the @entity6 centre - backs closer together - that won the day as the @entity6 conceded just once			2
@entity16 did something his predecessor ’s could n’t - he beat @entity8			1
can he keep dealing victories through his audacious tactics is up next ?			0

@entity52 beat @entity8 in a dramatic 2 - 1 victory in @entity106 at the @entity4
the @entity8 had beaten the @entity52 by the same scoreline in 2010
@entity16 lost striker @entity55 to a hamstring injury
@entity6 soccer fans made to suffer with ' hold on ' mode
