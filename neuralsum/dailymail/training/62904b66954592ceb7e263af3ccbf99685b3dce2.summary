a young mother with two adopted @entity2 children has shared the heart - melting story of when her autistic son was having a meltdown in @entity7 's - and a store employee ran up and gave her flowers			1
in a post for her blog , @entity12 - who lives with her family in @entity15 , @entity16 - said her young son @entity17 was having a screaming temper tantrum while the family shopped at the grocery chain			1
as they rushed from the store , mrs @entity12 said she felt ' close to tears ' from embarrassment and wished they could be ' invisible to the people bustling around us			1
' just before mrs @entity12 - who was also carrying her baby daughter @entity29 at the time - reached the car , a young female employee approached her with a huge bouquet and said : ' i was adopted as a baby and it has been a wonderful thing			1
we need more families like yours			0
' a beautiful family ! @entity12 with her daughter @entity29 , son @entity17 and husband @entity39 ( left to right ) they can be a handful ! despite some bumps in the road , mrs @entity12 calls her family 's situation ' a dream come true ' mrs @entity12 said she had to stop herself from crying while thanking the woman , who patted her on the shoulder , told her that her family was beautiful and walked back into the store			1
' my steps were much slower as i finally headed to the car with my arms full of flowers and tears that had spilled over onto my cheeks , ' she wrote			0
' on a day when i felt like we were the worst example of family ... a day when i hoped no one noticed us ... she did			0
but she did n't see what i assumed everyone was seeing			0
she did n't think what i assumed everyone was thinking			0
she saw beauty and love and hope and family			0
she thought we were wonderful and it made her smile			2
' alas , mrs @entity12 did not get the employee 's name , but wishes now - two years later - she could go back to the store and tell her how meaningful her gift still is			1

' you are a treasure			0
