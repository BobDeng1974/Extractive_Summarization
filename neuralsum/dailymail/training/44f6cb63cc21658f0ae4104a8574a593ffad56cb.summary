@entity0 will come up against his idol @entity1 on saturday - having first met the @entity3 skipper as an awe - struck child			1
former @entity6 midfielder song is in line to make his full @entity9 debut , and is likely to spend the afternoon looking to keep @entity1 , the man he believes is @entity3 's greatest ever player , as quiet as possible			1
having made his @entity9 bow in monday night 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity13 , the 27 - year - old @entity14 international is once again looking forward to locking horns with the former @entity18 captain			1
@entity0 ( right ) will come up against his idol @entity1 - having first met the @entity3 skipper as a child ' it 's not just focused on one player but i think @entity1 is the best player i 've seen in a @entity3 shirt for me			1
it 's my own opinion , ' said @entity0 , who is on loan from @entity26			1
' i have played against him a lot and every time i play against him , i have thought , ' today will be very hard '			0
' he has achieved a lot of things at @entity3 and is still only 34 years old			0
but he is still good enough to play - he can play maybe till he 's 40			2
when i see him run , he is a very good example to the young players coming through			0
' i think it is very important to have those kind of loyal players who play for @entity3 for a long time			0
it is a very different team when @entity1 is not in it			1
' i like @entity39 's style and the way he plays			2
when you are a midfielder , you try to watch other midfielders and how they play			0
for me , he is a great player - one of the best			0
@entity1 - photographed at @entity44 on thursday - takes his @entity3 side to @entity9 on saturday his cousin @entity46 ( playing for @entity9 ) passed on @entity1 's shirt back in 1999 ' i always try to watch the best players in my position and try to learn			1
@entity1 is one of the players i was watching when i was young			2
' song 's respect for @entity1 is well - rooted after he first met him during a trip to @entity18 to visit his cousin @entity46 , who was at @entity3 at the time			1
he said : ' i remember the first time i played against @entity3 was unbelievable			0
the first time i went to @entity18 was 1999 when i was watching @entity46 play			1
it was crazy because i took some pictures with the players - i was 12 years old			0
' then @entity46 gave me @entity1 's shirt from that day and i have kept it			1
i was training every single day in it and then when i played at @entity62 it it was against @entity1 , ( @entity66 ) @entity65 and ( @entity68 ) @entity67 - i never forgot this in my life			2
' that day , i still have the picture i took with @entity67 , and i was looking before the game to say their life was crazy and now i 'm playing against them			0
that is a very good thing			0
' i have still got the shirt			0
when you are young and someone gives you a shirt , you have to keep it			0
' @entity9 boss @entity83 will be hoping @entity0 is not in awe of @entity1 on saturday as he looks to prevent the @entity3 skipper having the same impact he did in the corresponding fixture last season			1
@entity1 scored two penalties either side of a @entity91 goal to earn a 2 - 1 win for @entity94 ' side - their ninth successive victory in what proved to ultimately be an unsuccessful push for the @entity99 title .			2
