this motorist avoided decapitation by millimetres when he crashed his 190mph corvette underneath a removal truck - by ducking			1
the driver of the sleek sports car was travelling up a steep highway when he came up behind the slow - moving hgv			0
he went into the back of the truck , causing the low slung @entity12 to go underneath it ; finally coming to a halt once the front of the sports car had gone six feet beneath the trailer			1
lucky to be alive : blood is clearly visible on the driver 's forehead as he is freed from the car write - off : the @entity21 was destroyed - but at least the driver was not badly hurt i may have pranged it slightly : the hgv was going slowly when the @entity21 went into the rear the middle - aged driver ducked at the last moment and avoided potential decapitation , emerging relatively unscathed despite the carnage			2
however , the high - powered @entity21 was less than lucky and was completely written off in the smash			0
the incredible incident took place on the southbound @entity34 near @entity35 in @entity36			1
retired @entity36 firefighter @entity37 , 60 , was among the first to arrive at the scene			1
he said : ' he was very lucky to say the least			0
in the past drivers have been decapitated after crashing underneath trucks so a law was introduced so they had barriers to prevent this			0
crash scene : firefighters examine the car and work out how they can free the @entity21 's driver pulled out : a stretcher is lowered down as the firefighters prepare to remove the driver from the wreck ' but somehow he still managed to get the corvette underneath			2
' it happened at about 11:10pm so the freeway was fairly open			0
it was an uphill stretch of the road and the truck was going slowly up the steep grade			2
' @entity21 must have been overtaking a few other cars and then all of a sudden he saw the slowing truck and went up the back of it			0
' i was first at the scene and it was unbelievable to see the guy in the @entity21 talking			0
he had some minor injuries but was in good spirits considering what had happened			1
' the driver was transported to the nearby @entity75 with minor injuries .			1

@entity12 ended up *wedged* *6ft* under the truck 's trailer
@entity81 escaped *collision* in @entity36 with minor injuries
