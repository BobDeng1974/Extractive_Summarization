working hours cut : a report shows businesses will lose more and more staff who need to care for relatives with @entity5 's thousands of people with dementia and their carers will be forced to give up their jobs , costing employers more than £ 3billion , warn campaigners			1
there will be a mounting toll on business from all forms of dementia including @entity5 ’s as the number affected is set to rise to over one million in @entity16 by 2030			1
a new report shows the cost of staff hours that will be lost due to caring for someone suffering from dementia , as well as the loss of skills and experience from the workforce			1
it says there will be a huge impact on businesses as increasing numbers of workers are obliged to reduce hours , change work patterns or even quit their jobs due to the demands of caring			1
the number of people leaving paid employment to care for people with dementia will rise from 50,000 in 2014 to 83,100 in 2030 , says the report from the @entity38 and @entity39			1
the cost of lost hours of workers with dementia forced to retire will go up from £ 628 million to reach £ 1.2 billion by 2030 , it says			1
this will be dwarfed by the £ 2.2billion cost of carers forced to quit , while £ 763 million will be lost by carers ’ curtailing their hours			1
companies must adapt the working environment to help sufferers and their carers in order to minimise the financial burden , and provide support to their workforce , says the report			1
for example , if companies used flexible working to increase their employment rate of dementia carers by just over two per cent the retention of these skilled and experienced staff would deliver a saving of £ 415 million by 2030			2
the report was released by @entity16 and @entity66 , who recently joined forces to launch the @entity70 campaign which aims to support people with dementia and their carers			2
it says businesses have started to recognise this issue , with one in 12 of 1,000 companies surveyed having made attempts to accommodate the needs of a member of staff with dementia			2
more than half are considering taking such action in the future			0
so far more than 20 major businesses are committed to supporting staff and customers with dementia			2
over 100,000 employees from businesses including @entity89 and @entity90 are now @entity70 , while other companies such as @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 ( @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 ) have also pledged for their staff to become @entity70			2
the report says businesses that are not ‘ dementia friendly ’ will lose out because the spending power of households affected by dementia , is set to double to £ 22.7 billion by 2030 , from £ 11 billion in 2014			1
growing problem : with an ageing population , the number of workers leaving to help family members with dementia will rise from the current 50,000 to 83,100 in 2030 , the report reveals @entity112 , chief executive of @entity66 , said ‘ thousands of people affected by dementia are forced to give up work and are denied a lifeline because of the failure of organisations to change the way they do business			1
‘ from the shop floor to boardrooms , dementia affects every workplace ; from people struggling with the early symptoms of memory loss at work , to those juggling a job whilst caring for a loved one			0
‘ as the condition touches the lives of more people , businesses must gear up to support all people with dementia ; staff and customers alike			0
‘ with dementia affecting millions of people , businesses who ignore the dementia pound do so at their own peril			0
’ health secretary @entity143 said ‘ dementia is one of the biggest challenges we face , and our ambition is to become one of the best countries in the world for dementia care			0
‘ we can only do this with the help and support of every part of society			0
‘ it ’s great that businesses , communities and individuals are showing such willingness to help and support those living with dementia – demonstrated by nearly 350,000 people who have already signed up to become @entity70			0
’ @entity162 , managing director for @entity92 , said ‘ @entity92 is committed to supporting vulnerable customers and we have the ambition to be the most accessible and inclusive bank for all customers and clients			0
‘ becoming a dementia friendly company is something that we feel is important to support our colleagues , customers and wider society			0
