e-cigarettes could be luring teens into trying smoking - and lead them onto smoking ' real ' cigarettes , researchers have warned			1
they found one - third of @entity5 teens have tried e-cigarettes - half of whom have never used another tobacco product			1
they claim if a similar pattern was repeated in the @entity12 , it could lead to a ' epidemic of teen tobacco use '			1
e-cigs contain far fewer cancer - causing and other toxic substances than cigarettes , however their long - term effects on health and nicotine dependence are unknown			2
the popularity of e-cigarettes , which typically deliver nicotine , propylene glycol , glycerin and flavorings through inhaled vapor , has increased in the past five years			2
' the concern is that e-cigarette advertising is recruiting intermediate risk adolescents to nicotine use - kids who would not otherwise have started smoking , ' said @entity41 , of @entity43 's @entity42 in a paper published in the journal @entity46			0
' these are kids who might go on to smoke cigarettes , which are much better at delivering nicotine than e-cigarettes			1
' if this pattern of use is adopted by adolescents in the continental @entity12 , we could be in for an epidemic of teen tobacco use in this country that could greatly reduce the overall benefits to public health of e-cigarettes			1
' researchers from @entity43 and the @entity60 collaborated in the 2013 survey - based study of 1,941 adolescents aged 14 - 15 years old in public and private schools in @entity64			2
cigarettes are highly taxed in @entity64 and e-cigarettes , with their potent combination of lower cost and kid - friendly flavours such as mango and pineapple , may be more attractive to teens			1
@entity73 , phd , of the @entity74 , said e-cigarettes , which are widely available in @entity64 , marketing is ' very aggressive here			2
' he added that manufacturers place ads in venues such as movie theaters where adolescents socialize , as well as on radio and television			0
nearly nine per cent of eighth graders have admitted using an e-cigarette , compared with four per cent who have taken a normal cigarette			0
professor @entity88 of the @entity89 said : ' i worry that the tremendous progress that we 've made over the last almost two decades in smoking could be reversed on us by the introduction of e-cigarettes			2
' e-cigarettes have been on sale in the @entity12 since 2006 , but this is the first year that the @entity98 has measured their use			1
' this is a markedly different pattern of use compared to their peers in the continental @entity12 , where teen e-cigarette use is less than half that rate and e-cigarette users are mainly also cigarette smokers ( dual - users ) , ' reported the team			1
@entity41 and collaborators were so concerned about the findings that they submitted them to the @entity115 docket to inform proposed regulations on e-cigarettes			2
they note that favouring packaging , and marketing of e-cigarettes is not regulated , and that manufacturers ' opportunities to target adolescents are wide open , absent @entity115 regulation of these products			0
a recent study found e-cigarettes are less addictive than cigarettes for former smokers , researchers have proved			1
the research sheds new light on how nicotine addiction works			0
however , experts warn the long term health risk of e-cigarettes are still unknown			0
' we found that e-cigarettes appear to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes in a large sample of long - term users , ' said @entity138 , professor of public health sciences and psychiatry , @entity140			1
the popularity of e-cigarettes , which typically deliver nicotine , propylene glycol , glycerin and flavourings through inhaled vapour , has increased in the past five years			0
the investigators assessed risk status for three groups ( non-users , e-cigarette - only users , and dual - users ) on variables that predict future use of cigarettes , and found the e-cigarette - only users to have risk that was in between the never - smokers and dual - users			1
statistical analysis examined risk and protective variables across a spectrum of use , comparing never - smokers with e-cigarette - only users and e-cigarette - only users with dual - users			0
risk factors for smoking cigarettes include protective variables such as parental support and academic involvement , in addition to risk factors including peer smoking and sensation seeking			0
on almost all of those measures , e-cigarette users ranked somewhere between the never - smokers and the dual - users			0
there are currently more than 400 brands of ' e-cigs ' available in the @entity12			1
e-cigs contain far fewer cancer - causing and other toxic substances than cigarettes , however their long - term effects on health and nicotine dependence are unknown			0
to study e-cigarette dependence , the researchers developed an online survey , including questions designed to assess previous dependence on cigarettes and almost identical questions to assess current dependence on e-cigs			1
more than 3,500 current users of e-cigs who were ex-cigarette smokers completed the @entity203 and the @entity204			0
higher nicotine concentration in e-cig liquid , as well as use of advanced second - generation e-cigs , which deliver nicotine more efficiently than earlier ' cigalikes , ' predicted dependence			0
consumers who had used e-cigs longer also appeared to be more addicted .			0

currently more than 400 brands of e-cigarettes available in the @entity12
researchers found third of @entity5 teens have tried e-cigarettes
half of those surveyed had never used another tobacco product
e-cigarettes are now more popular than tobacco cigarettes among teens
