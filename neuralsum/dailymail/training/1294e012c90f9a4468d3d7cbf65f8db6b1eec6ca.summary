by @entity0 published : 04:03 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 09:04 est , 16 april 2013 a student has told how she was conned by the @entity2 into believing its journalist was a history professor so he travel to @entity5 for a @entity7 investigation			1
the @entity9 student , who wants to remain anonymous , has intensified pressure on the @entity2 , which is under fire over a @entity13 documentary shown last night			0
the student told @entity15 : ' [ @entity7 journalist ] @entity17 was presented to use as a history professor from a university in @entity20			0
' i was wondering why they were filming him so much			0
it was two days before then end of the trip that i realised he was an undercover journalist			0
' the claims follow an interview with a student in today 's @entity30 who said she felt exploited and put at risk by the @entity2			0
meanwhile tensions again heightened on the @entity33 , with the @entity5 's military warning of ' sledge - hammer blows ' in retaliation to protests in the @entity38 against leader @entity39			1
undercover : an @entity9 student has come forward today to reveal that some travellers believed @entity7 reporter @entity17 was a history professor until two days before the end of their trip to @entity5 the student said that the @entity7 film crew , whose documentary was broadcast last night , at no point warned the young travellers of the risks they faced travelling with them to the dictatorship			2
it is claimed that the group were only informed they would be accompanied by a single print journalist , with no indication that the journalist would be travelling undercover			0
' we realised things as we went along , ' said the student , who has asked @entity15 not to publish any identifying details out of fear of reprisals by the murderous @entity5 regime			2
' i just know that at the point that i accepted [ a place on the trip ] i did n't know that the journalist would be undercover			0
' the latest testimony comes after a young woman yesterday spoke to the @entity30 to tell how ten students , the youngest just 18 , only learned they were ' cover ' for the @entity2 's filming hours before entering @entity5			1
but the most shocking claims involved the cover story given to mr @entity17 , who presented the @entity7 documentary			0
exploited : the @entity9 student , who has asked to remain anonymous , said that at no point when organisers asked for confirmation did they reveal that the group would be travelling with an undercover investigative journalist it was believed that his posing as an @entity9 history professor was a ruse to fool @entity5 authorities , but the latest account suggests that many students on the trip actually believed he was a real professor			2
the @entity2 today reiterated its denial that students were tricked and released statements from two students on the trip who said they were made completely aware that they would be travelling with an undercover documentary team			0
@entity99 , one of those students , said : ' i can speak for myself that i went on the trip fully aware that if we were discovered we may even be arrested - which is the reason i insisted on using my @entity106 passport ( i also hold an @entity109 country passport ) to make the @entity5 visa â€“ a @entity106 citizen is less likely to be prosecuted			2
' yes , the @entity2 lied to @entity5 - but in my opinion a regime like that deserves to be lied to , and it surprises me that the @entity9 - after the @entity116 scandal - is trying to cancel a documentary exposing a dictatorship			2
' the second student , who preferred to remain anonymous , said that organisers had repeatedly made clear to the group they would be joined by a journalist and that this could pose a risk to them if they were found out			0
' to me , it seemed the worst thing possible to happen would be to be expelled from @entity5 and not be allowed to re-enter the country , ' said the student			2
' i decided that to be a risk to be very worth taking in order to experience the uniqueness of @entity5			2
' the young student 's statements come as @entity5 today vowed ' sledge - hammer blows ' against the @entity38 after protests against the regime 's leading dynasty , warning that attacks will start ' without notice '			1
it demanded that @entity143 authorities apologise for protests in the capital @entity146 where demonstrators had burned a portrait of @entity5 leader @entity39			1
the chilling ultimatum came after tensions had eased slightly on the @entity33 as the pariah state celebrated the birth of its first leader , @entity154			1
@entity5 leader @entity39 , centre , with his generals : the pariah state issued an ultimatum warning the @entity38 that attacks could begin ' without notice ' after demonstrations in @entity146 against the @entity39 dynasty show of force : soldiers visit @entity166 in @entity13 , where bronze statues ( in the background ) of former @entity5 leaders @entity154 and @entity170 stand as the country celebrated the birth of its founder standing ready : @entity175 soldiers prepare to fire 105mm howitzers during an exercise in @entity178 , @entity143 , near the border village of @entity180 , earlier today in recent days the @entity5 has threatened nuclear attacks on the @entity182 , @entity143 and @entity183 after new sanctions were imposed in response to its latest nuclear arms test in february			1
the shrill threats had gone quiet yesterday as the country marked the 101st anniversary of the birth of @entity154 , raising hopes for an easing of tension in a region that has for weeks seemed on the verge of conflict			1
but the @entity5 's @entity198 news agency said today the @entity5 army had issued an ultimatum to the @entity38 after rallies in the @entity38 on monday at which portraits of @entity5 's leaders were burned			1
' our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now , ' @entity198 reported , citing military leaders of the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , as @entity5 is officially known			2
' the military demonstration of the @entity5 's revolutionary armed forces will be powerful sledge - hammer blows at all hostile forces hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership			1

the @entity182 had dispatched @entity246 and @entity247 stealth bombers to take part			0
but in the latest ultimatum the @entity249 did not threaten @entity182			1
instead it reserved its anger for what it calls @entity143 's ' puppet ' government			0
it even mentioned the possibility of dialogue , suggesting that it was not really about to launch war in response to routine protests by at most a few dozen people in @entity146 , despite the anger they raised			0
' if the puppet authorities truly want dialogue and negotiations , they should apologise for all anti-dprk hostile acts , big and small , and show the compatriots their will to stop all these acts , ' said the @entity5 's military			1
taking threats seriously : @entity143 emergency service personnel wearing chemical protective clothing participate in an anti-chemical warfare exercise in @entity146 earlier today , as war rhetoric was again stepped up @entity280 faced : @entity5 has in recent days made threats of nuclear strikes on the @entity182 , @entity143 and @entity183 after new sanctions were imposed in response to its latest nuclear arms test in february taking no chances : but a @entity143 diplomat today said the latest ultimatum was ' not worth a response ' a @entity143 @entity291 spokesman later told a briefing the @entity5 ultimatum was not worth a response and @entity143 was waiting for the @entity5 to make a ' wise decision '			1
last week , the @entity38 's president @entity296 offered talks but the @entity249 rejected the overture as a ' cunning ' ploy			2
mr @entity296 will meet @entity182 president @entity301 at the @entity300 on may 7 to discuss economic and security issues , including ' countering the @entity5 threat ' , the @entity300 said on monday			1

analysts say the @entity5 's most recent ultimatum ended on a conciliatory note tourists pose for souvenir photos : it even mentioned the possibility of dialogue , suggesting that it was not really about to launch war in response to protests by a few dozen people in @entity146 , despite the anger they raised the @entity182 has also offered talks with the @entity5 , but on the pre-condition that it abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions			1
that seems unlikely , as @entity5 has described its nuclear weapons as a ' treasured sword ' and has vowed to never give them up			0
nevertheless , @entity182 secretary of state @entity331 , as he yesterday ended a trip to the region dominated by concern about @entity5 , stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution			1
