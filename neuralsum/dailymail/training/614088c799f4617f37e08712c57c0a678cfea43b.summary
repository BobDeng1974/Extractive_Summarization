@entity1 archaeologists and filmmakers have begun a massive expedition to explore the hauntingly beautiful sunken caves of @entity6 ’s @entity5 , once considered by the @entity7 as the gateways to their underworld			1
the description seems only appropriate given the hundreds of human remains that line the floors of these underwater labyrinths			1
in the @entity17 , these caves , which were dry at the time , were used as burial sites			2
later , the @entity7 worshiped them and believed that they would lead them to the ‘ @entity21			1
’ today , these caves are the subject of a new 3 - d film titled ‘ @entity25 , ’ which is set to hit theaters in the summer of 2013			1
but already , photos from the one - of - kind voyage give us a preview of the unsettling wonders held in these subterranean caverns			1
spectacular : @entity1 archaeologists and filmmakers are exploring the hauntingly beautiful underwater caves along @entity6 's @entity5 with the hope of finding historical artifacts			1
one of kind : already , the crew has found some a treasure trove of items , including 10,000 - year - old human remains			1
never before seen : these remains date back to the @entity17 when these caves were used as burial grounds and have never been filmed before			1
the @entity7 lived in this region of @entity6 from around 3,000 b.c. to 900 a.d , and they believed that these caverns led to their mystical underworld known as @entity49 , or the ' @entity21			1
' written about in their ancient scrolls , @entity49 was a complicated place			2
it was to be both feared , filled with monstrous beings , but also revered , as it was home to the beloved dead			0
to honor those who had fallen , the @entity7 constructed temples throughout tunnels like these			1
in the end , it was believed that those who could make it through the dreaded @entity49 would rise ' triumphantly like the sun. ' but getting these shots is no simple task for director @entity67 and his team			0
they require transporting incredibly expensive @entity71 cameras , along with hundreds of pounds of equipment , through the sweltering jungles before then lowering them deep into the jagged rocks of the caves below			2
the crew must then dive as deep as 300 feet to access the hundreds of miles of meandering tunnels with little less than a lantern to cut through the absolute darkness			1
‘ if , under these circumstances , you calculate your air supply incorrectly , get lost or panic , you 're as good as dead , ’ @entity81 , a team member , told @entity82			0
but all of this is worth in the end , as their ultimate goal is to document for the first time ever some of the historical treasures kept deep underground			2
already , they have discovered some of the oldest human remains to be found in the @entity95 - the 10,000 - year - old bones of a boy			1
they also found a fire pit from roughly 8,500 years ago kept in astoundingly good condition			2
the water helps to preserve much of these items that otherwise would have disintegrated years ago			0
team leader @entity102 said , ‘ it looked as if there had been a fire there just the day before yesterday			0
’ the crew has also discovered ancient ceramics and jewelry left by the @entity7 , as well as the remains from long - extinct animals , including the giant ground sloth and the mastodon			1
in the end , they hope to discover more artifacts that can perhaps shed light on the origins of species on the continent			0
‘ perhaps the cenotes contain the answer to the questions of when the first humans reached the @entity95 and how the continent was settled , ’ @entity102 said			0
to make this incredibly journey possible , the crew have relied on a combination of will and the best modern technology has to offer			0
because the crews are diving so deep underwater , compressed air alone would not work			2
instead , divers must rely on @entity135 , a combination of oxygen , nitrogen and helium to survive			0
@entity140 : crew members dive as deep as 300 feet to access the hundreds of miles of meandering tunnels with little less than a lantern to cut through the absolute darkness			1
as far as capturing their astonishing discoveries , the crew uses high - tech camera cases that are light and small enough to capture these incredible moments on film			0
in the past , to transport @entity71 cameras underwater , filmmakers used to have to keep their machinery in underwater cases that were almost as tall as a man and weighed hundreds of pounds			2
carrying it was difficult enough , let alone having to move it through narrow passageways of underwater caves			0
the film 's producers say the costs are more than enough to be able to ultimately , @entity102 believes that the documentary will allow viewers to catch a glimpse of this magic place and that the @entity71 will let them feel as if they were actually there			0
and while he understands that exposing these treasures may mean jeopardizing their safety , he hopes that it it will in turn lead to their preservation			0
' of course , this sort of film can increase the temptation , ' @entity102 says			0
' but it can also promote respect for this world and the willingness to protect it			0

@entity1 filmmakers are exploring caves in @entity6 's @entity5 to document the one - of - kind wonders held there
already , they have found 10,000 - year - old human remains and bones from a number of extinct animals
crews dive below 300 feet and navigate hundreds of miles of meandering tunnels
