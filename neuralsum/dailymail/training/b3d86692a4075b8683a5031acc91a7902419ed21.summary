@entity0 announced himself on the international scene earlier in the week as his 25 - yard strike earned @entity3 a 2 - 1 victory over @entity5			1
his first goal for his country was quite a hit , and as well as making an impact for @entity3 he has established himself as one of the stars of the @entity13			2
but how much do you know about one - time @entity16 target @entity17 ? here , @entity18 tells you some more … @entity3 substitute @entity0 celebrates after scoring the winner for his country late on in the game @entity17 ( centre ) and @entity23 celebrate after the former put @entity3 2 - 1 up against @entity5 in @entity25 where does he come from ? the 23 - year - old was born in @entity28 , the capital of coastal state @entity30			1
@entity0 grew up supporting @entity32 and idolising former @entity34 winner @entity33			0
the attacking midfielder started playing football at his local academy , @entity37 , before he moved to @entity38 in 2008 as an 18 - year - old			1
how did his career develop ? he was loaned to second - tier @entity41 in 2010 and it was here he made his name , scoring seven goals and earning himself the player of the season award in his first campaign as a full professional			0
this caught the eye of many @entity52 clubs , including ( reportedly ) @entity16			0
however it was @entity56 side @entity54 who acted the fastest , signing @entity0 for £ 3.5million in january 2011 after he originally joined in december 2010			2
@entity0 grew up as a supporter of @entity59 side @entity32 and idolised national superstar @entity33 born : 2 october 1991 , @entity28 , @entity3 age : 23 hero : @entity33 clubs : ( 2009 - 10 ) @entity41 - 38 apps , 8 goals ( 2011 - ) 1899 @entity67 apps , 34 goals honours : @entity71 @entity3 's @entity70 2014 how did he find it in @entity56 ? he struggled in his first year at @entity54			1
he was dropped in november 2011 for turning up late for training			0
however after re-gaining his place he went on to score seven goals in 26 appearances			0
@entity17 is now regarded as a fans ’ favourite , making 127 appearances and scoring 42 times			0
last season he hit 22 goals in all competitions			0
but , more impressively , finished fourth top scorer in the @entity13 and second in the assist standings			1
did they take any notice back at home ? after what many regard as a breakthrough season in 2013 - 14 , @entity59 journalists began to call for @entity17 ’s inclusion in the international set up			2
they voted him @entity70 on @entity97 , as he beat the likes of @entity100 ’s @entity99 and @entity102 ’s @entity101 to the award			1
after another impressive start to the season , scoring five goals in 11 games , he was included in the national squad for international friendlies against @entity110 and @entity5			0
having made his debut against @entity110 , he then scored that goal against the @entity113			0
@entity17 beat @entity99 ( far left ) and @entity101 ( right ) to become @entity70 how far can he go ? the @entity13 is one of the strongest leagues in world football and at 23 the playmaker is already recognised as one of the biggest talents the @entity56 game has to offer			1
the sad reality for @entity54 fans is the sense of inevitability surrounding the future of @entity17 – a goalscoring midfielder who prefers the no 10 role - as one would assume his performances are not going unnoticed by the giants of @entity52 football			2
@entity17 is a more traditional , skilful @entity59 attacking midfielder who likes to shoot from range ( as shown by his first international goal ) and if he is able to maintain his current form there is no doubt he will go on to become a regular for his country .			1

@entity59 *youngster* scored a 25 - yard goal against @entity5 on *tuesday*
before moving to @entity54 the 23 - year - old was on @entity16 's radar
attacking midfielder was dropped in 2011 for *consistent* lateness
last season he finished fourth top scorer in the @entity13 and second in the assist standings
@entity97 voted him @entity70 in 2014
