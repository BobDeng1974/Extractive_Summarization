a few immature callers have gone and ruined a decades - long free figure drawing class			1
the @entity2 has ended a weekly class for community artists to sketch nude models , saying it could not afford the increasing cost of keeping the popular classes secure			1
during the past two and a half weeks , the art school saw a marked increase in phone calls and emails inquiring about the sessions , @entity8 , the school 's associate dean for finance said			1
some of the callers were asking ' off - color ' questions , some dealing with the appearance of the models , he said			1
cover up , class is cancelled : a figure drawing class has been cancelled at the @entity2 , after the school started receiving ' off - color ' calls about the models			1
above , a figure sketch drawn by @entity24 , one of the community members who attended the class ' that 's not somebody who 's looking to come in for art , ' @entity8 said			1
' as we start to get calls on that , we have to take a step back and say we 're running this program , we have an ethical responsibility to make sure we 're doing this in a safe environment			1
and we did not feel we could provide that at this point			0
' the calls started after someone posted fliers seeking models , he said			2
however , artists who participated in the class say they never saw any inappropriate behavior			2
but of the harmless type			0
artists , ' local @entity24 told @entity52			0
' one model ( a student there ) even relayed how she had never experienced a bad time at the session , but she had had bad experiences posing for the @entity2 's classes , ' mr @entity24 added			1
classes with nude models are part of the curriculum in the @entity64			0
but those classes are n't open to the general public			2
on saturdays , 30 to 35 people from a group known as the saturday @entity69 regularly show up to draw a nude model , said artist @entity71 , the group 's volunteer coordinator			2
the group has been meeting since the mid- 1990s , participants told the @entity75 in a story wednesday			1
' figure drawing is a very mild activity , ' @entity71 said			1
' kind of slow and quiet			0
' the university gave the @entity75 a letter sent to the saturday participants from @entity82 , acting dean of the school			2
long - standing : the saturday figure drawing class offered for free to community members has been held at the @entity2 since the mid- 1990s ' as these sessions have increased in prominence , they have had the unfortunate consequence of drawing unwanted attention to the fact that nude models can be found on the @entity2 campus in an unstructured and unmonitored environment , ' @entity82 wrote			1
she said a limited budget has prevented the university from putting more resources into security that would allow the sessions to continue			0
however , @entity82 said drawing nudes has value and purpose in the creation of art and the development of artistic ability , and she pointed out nonprofit art centers where community members could do such work			1
the models get $ 15 an hour and earn five hours of pay for each three - hour session because it 's on weekends , @entity71 said			2
some models who work in the classrooms also work at the saturday sessions			0
@entity121 , 27 , told the @entity75 that modeling at the saturday sessions had helped her grow			0
' i 'd have to say that group helped me become a person who realizes how safe i am , ' she said			0
' it really inspires a person like me , who ca n't draw			0
it 's a group of people who get together doing what they love			0
and they 're so respectful of each other			0

the @entity2 has cancelled a free figure drawing class open to the community after getting several ' off - color ' calls
the saturday art class had been running since the mid- 1990s
