@entity1 head coach @entity0 is using rugby to change the way his @entity5 - winning side tackle , and his approach could have far - reaching implications for the @entity8 the 63 - year - old used video footage last summer to cite examples of leading with the shoulder , not the head , to make @entity13 safer			1
with a concussion lawsuit involving 4,500 former players swirling in the background , @entity0 and defensive passing game coordinator @entity14 have taken a proactive step			1
‘ it ’s a culmination of myself , personally making the transition of not fighting the old way and giving in to that we ’ve got to take care of our players in a better way , ’ the avuncular @entity0 said during his press conference on wednesday			2
@entity1 head coach @entity0 is studying rugby to change the way his players tackle after studying rugby , he was intrigued by the quality of tackling and the lack of injuries despite no helmets or body armour			1
and he saw no reason why the approach could not be adopted by his fast , hard - hitting defense , widely considered to be the best in the @entity8			2
‘ we have found that you can tackle and totally emphasise shoulder tackling and getting your head out of football and really that coincides so much with the language and the message we ’ve heard come about for all of the right reasons , that we wanted to share it , so we did			2
‘ with the @entity54 that distributes stuff to all of the high school coaches , 14,000 high school coaches and thousands of youth coaches , we thought maybe we can get the word out			0
@entity0 is intrigued by the quality of tackling in rugby and also the safety considering there is no protection @entity67 's defence , led by @entity68 ( above ) is among the best the league has seen in recent years ‘ when i first asked @entity71 ( @entity72 ) and sent it to the league and said what do you think , and one of the first phone calls i got was from coach @entity79			1
he called and said , “ where has this been ? we ’ve needed this			0
this gives us an opportunity to shift the language some and the focus			0
” ‘ i know that the league sent it out to everybody that they send stuff out to , so thousands and thousands of people			0
the responses that we get have all almost always been favourable			0
i love the responses we get from coaches that say , ‘ thanks for doing this because it helps us with our kids , ’ or whatever			0
this is just the start though			0
’ the @entity8 has taken steps to protect its players , with penalties for head - to - head contact			1
and you will seldom witness a @entity1 player doing so as @entity0 does not permit it			1
@entity1 head coach @entity0 at the team 's practice session in @entity114 on wednesday the @entity1 practice in @entity116 , @entity114 on wednesday ahead of the @entity5 his philosophy is rubbing off on his players , as defensive end @entity119 explained : ‘ i think you ’re conscious of it because he beats it into your head so often			1
‘ he talks about it a lot			0
just tackling in general , and style of tackling is something he emphasises so much			2
subconsciously , you start thinking about it more and more and even though you do n’t tackle full - speed in practice , in your head you ’re finishing off the tackle			2
by the time game day comes , it works out for us because we come out fast			0
’ with teams already copying @entity67 ’s model , should @entity0 lead @entity67 to consecutive @entity5 , his approach to tackling could see a sea change in the @entity8 .			1

@entity1 head coach wants to use rugby to make @entity8 safer and his team 's tackling better
