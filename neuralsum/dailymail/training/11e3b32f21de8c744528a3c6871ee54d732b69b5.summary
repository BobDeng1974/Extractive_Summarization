a teenager who took a photo of a @entity3 impersonator was stunned - after spotting a picture of what looks like @entity3 's ghost in the background			1
@entity8 , 14 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , took three snaps of the @entity3 tribute act as he waited in line for a signature			1
but when he got home and looked at the pictures he noticed what appears - sort of , if you squint - to be the ghost of the late entertainer hovering above his impersonator 's head in one of the frames			1
the return of the king : this picture appears to show the ghostly visage of @entity3 ( top right ) checking out what his impersonator is writing uncanny : these photos shows the ... striking ... similarity between the face of the ghost and the singer @entity8 went to the @entity37 with his family to watch a @entity3 live tribute show			1
he said : ' it was so eerie			1
there was nothing there at all when i was waiting in line			2
' i have no idea what happened on that one picture , but it ’s terrifying			2
it was like something out of @entity52			2
' it ’s like he just popped his head in to see what was going on and then left			2
i never used to believe in ghosts , but now i ’m not so sure			0
' his mother @entity58 , 54 , added : ' the image is so clear			0
i was there and i can adamantly say that there were no mirrors , no trickery , nothing like that at all			0
sha - mone : @entity8 went to the @entity37 with his family to watch a @entity3 live tribute show ' sometimes you can see these things in photos , it is an image of something but you are almost willing it to be something else			1
' but you look at that and it is clearly a face and it does look like @entity3			0
and the fact it was a @entity3 event and there he was makes it all the more eerie			0
' although , i think if he did come back from the dead , he probably would n’t go to watch an impersonator			0
' in the photo , @entity3 ’s ghost is seemingly peering over the shoulder of a @entity3 impersonator , perhaps trying to see what he is writing .			0

ghostly king of pop may have been snapped by **fan** at tribute act . perhaps
