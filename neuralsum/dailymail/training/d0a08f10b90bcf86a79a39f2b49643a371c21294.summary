it has been almost 10 years in the making			0
but today @entity3 's long - awaited @entity2 , destined to fly passengers to space for a cool $ 250,000 ( Â£ 150,000 ) , crashed during a test flight			1
the catastrophic explosion is the latest disaster in a slew of delays and set - backs that have plagued the seemingly perpetual project			1
@entity3 announced his ambition to reach space in 2005 , and immediately received requests from celebrities - including @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 - wanting to nab a seat on the craft			1
the unprecedented venture was dubbed ' classic @entity3 ' , tying neatly with the @entity26 boss 's notorious penchant for taking risks and pushing limits , in everything from boats to hot air balloons			1
but it has been marred by delays and set - backs since 2005 catastrophic crash : two pilots were on board , and authorities confirmed one was dead , with the second being taken to hospital in @entity44 with serious injuries aboard a helicopter ( pictured ) record breaker : the adventurous @entity26 boss started out with record speeds in boats and hot air balloons in july 2008 , @entity3 sparked a flurry of excitement as he predicted that the maiden space voyage would take place within 18 months			1
when the fateful month came around , october 2009 , @entity56 issued a statement to say initial flights for the @entity3 family would take place from @entity61 ' within two years '			1
the declaration was followed by another on december 7 , 2009 : @entity2 was unveiled and @entity3 told his many ticket holders to prepare to fly in 2011			1
come april 2011 , @entity3 says that flights will not begin for another 18 months due to ' delays '			1
two years later , on april 29 , 2013 , @entity2 had its first test flight			1
however , it only achieved a speed of 920 mph - less than half the speed @entity3 predicted			1
back to the drawing board , the notoriously bravado @entity26 boss announces the first flight will take place just eight months later on christmas day 2013			2
the flight did not take place			2
in september 2014 , @entity3 said the first flight was slated for february or march in 2015			1
today , on october 31 , 2014 , the craft air tested a new kind of fuel : hydroxyl - terminated polybutadiene , a form of rubber , to a polyamide - based plastic			1
it crashed , killing one of the two pilots			0
ambitious : @entity3 unveiled the mothership @entity84 in 2008 ( pictured ) by uncorking champagne ' dream big ' : he said he was determined to make the impossible possible by flying into space with his family in a tweet , @entity3 offered his condolences : ' thoughts with all @entity92 , thanks for all your messages of support			1
i 'm flying to @entity98 immediately to be with the team			2
' the set - back is a blow to his risk - taking reputation			0
just yesterday he announced that @entity105 will become the first airline in @entity107 to put newly qualified pilots into the cockpit of a long - haul aircraft			0
the trainee pilots will be ' part of the @entity26 family from day one ' , he explained			0
applicants are simply required to have a minimum of five gcses or equivalent including maths , science and @entity120			0
the move would have been shocking if it came from any other airline			0
but @entity3 started his career in the aviation industry on a whim - snapping up a second - hand 747 without even having flown a plane - insisting that one has to ' dream big by setting yourself seemingly impossible challenges ... then catch up with them '			1
he has made several world record - breaking attempts			0
he attempted the fastest @entity133 crossing in 1985 aboard the @entity134			0
the boat capsized in @entity137 waters , forcing an @entity139 rescue			0
a year later , he beat the record by two hours			0
the next year , his hot air balloon @entity142 also crossed the pond to the @entity144 before attempting to cross the @entity145 from @entity146 to @entity147 in the 2,600,000 cubic feet			0
hitting a speed of 245 miles an hour , they broke the record			0
another record - breaking balloon flight came in 1998 : from @entity152 to @entity153			2
but the team 's plan to circumnavigate the world at record speed was scuppered by another group in 1999			0
he has been known to spout aphorisms such as : ' in the end , you have to say " screw it , just do it " ' and ' big ideas also mean big risks '			0
regarding his space mission , he said : ' if you set seemingly impossible challenges , you make what people believed impossible possible , ' laughing that he could n't believe he was taken seriously when he suggested that we colonize @entity172			0
with @entity56 , however , he has been keen to insist safety is a priority			2
the only way he will persuade enough people to become space tourists with @entity56 , he told the @entity178 in 2010 , is by shedding his image as a reckless adventurer			2
in an interview in february 2014 @entity3 said that his private space flight venture could not ' afford to lose anyone '			1
in an interview with @entity185 , he said : ' everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space programme and understands the risks that go with that			0
pioneering : @entity3 , pictured with prime minister @entity191 in 1986 when he broke the record for sailing across the @entity133			2
his first attempt a year earlier saw the boat capsized and rescued by the @entity139 taking the plunge : @entity3 piloted his amphibious car across the @entity197 to @entity198 in june 2004 ' the biggest worry i had was re-entry			2
@entity201 has lost about three per cent of everyone who 's gone into space , and re-entry has been their biggest problem			0
' for a government - owned company , you can just about get away with losing three per cent of your clients			0
for a private company you ca n't really lose anybody			0
' @entity3 's big project has attracted a slew of big name passengers happy to pay for this once in a lifetime experience , including newlyweds @entity17 and @entity18 ; @entity19 and his manager @entity218 ; @entity219 , who plans to try and sing in space ; former pop star @entity221 , who has long been vocal about his desire to head to space ; and @entity224 , who was the 500th customer to purchase a ticket			1
@entity226 also got a ticket for his birthday from ex-wife @entity20 when the two were married			2
@entity230 bought a ticket as well so @entity226 would not have to go alone			0
submarine : in 2011 , he announced plans to conquer the sea in a submarine while his space plan was on hold @entity3 has recently also rolled out a new challenger boat			2
he has been known to spout aphorisms such as : ' in the end , you have to say " screw it , just do it " ' and ' big ideas also mean big risks ' @entity247 and @entity248 are also set to fly , but got their seats for free			1
@entity248 because she is married to @entity3 's nephew , @entity252 , and @entity247 because @entity3 wanted to offer the legendary astrophysicist a chance to go into space			1
@entity256 and @entity137 's @entity257 will also be on board			1
however , sir @entity3 is facing a ' backlash ' from some of the nearly 700 passengers who have already paid for a ticket on the craft			1
some stumped up the fee as long ago as 2005 , but still have no idea when they will eventually reach space			0
the 600 - plus takers for the flights are already benefiting from their ticket purchase , which by extension enters them into an exclusive club that has seen them visit @entity275 and the @entity276 with @entity3 along with undertaking g - force training .			1

@entity2 , @entity3 's unprecedented project , was flying under *rocket* power then tweeted that it ' experienced an in - flight *anomaly* '
@entity56 confirmed craft exploded . images show debris of the craft
@entity219 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity256 , *princess* @entity257 and @entity248 among those who have signed up to fly in the *spacecraft*
the flight has been delayed *numerous* times in the past decade
sir @entity3 had *pledged* to be on first flight with his family
more than 700 customers have paid as much as $ 250,000 for a seat
