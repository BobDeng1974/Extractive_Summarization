by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 26 february 2013 a plane used by a gang of drug smugglers to bring nearly £ 2million of cocaine into the @entity5 is being sold by police on @entity7			1
detectives seized the plane when they brought down an international smuggling ring in @entity11 last year			1
it will now be available to the highest bidder online with the sale money to be used by police to fight crime and set up community projects			1
for sale : police are selling this microlight plane , seized from a gang of drug smugglers last year , for £ 12,000 on @entity7 for sale : the plane was seized by officers from the @entity26 as it landed in @entity11 on a drugs run but the plane , which officers say will need some work to be airworthy again , will come at a price			1
the @entity33 microlight has a reserve price of £ 12,000 on the online auction site			1
the plane was used by drugs traffickers to fly a shipment of cocaine from @entity40 to @entity11 last year			1
the class a drugs - which had a street value of £ 1.7 million pounds - had been driven from @entity43 in the @entity44 to northern @entity40 before being loaded onto the aircraft and flown across the @entity46			0
but the gang were thwarted at the final hurdle when a team from the @entity26 was on hand to arrest the smugglers as they landed			2
six @entity5 men , all from @entity53 , @entity11 , and @entity54 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class a drugs in november last year and were jailed for a combined total of 37 years			2
@entity58 , the @entity59 , said : ' i believe this may be the first time a force in the country has seized an aeroplane and is in a position to sell it , so this is a great result for us			0
' bidding on the plane end shortly after 8pm on march 4			0
good cause : proceeds from the online auction be used by police to fight crime and set up community projects out of action : the plane is listed on @entity7 as needing some work to be airworthy again after the wings had to be removed for storage the microlight is listed as needing work to be done to it to make it airworthy because the wings were removed for storage purposes			1
detective inspector @entity86 , from the @entity26 , said : ' it is relatively common to confiscate a criminal 's car , but it 's not often that we make an application to seize a plane so we ca n't really predict how the bidding is likely to go			0
' that said , whoever does buy it will do so knowing that their money is being put to good use and that they have helped deprive these offenders of a valuable asset that they planned to use to carry out their crimes			0
justice : the gang who were caught using the microlight have since been jailed for a combined total of 37 years ' when a case such as this results in convictions at court and considerable prison sentences for the defendants , we do not see that as the end of the matter			0
' we have the legislative powers to seize criminal assets to strip criminals of their possessions at every stage of the investigation			0
' the plane is not the only loot seized from criminals which the force currently has up for sale			2
a replica second world war german @entity133 motorbike and sidecar is on offer for £ 4,500 and a @entity137 watch is on sale for £ 1,750 .			0
