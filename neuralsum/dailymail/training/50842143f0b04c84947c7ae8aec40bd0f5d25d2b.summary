just hours later the 30 - year - old was rushed to hospital suffering from severe muscle damage brought on by exercising too hard			1
doctors told her that she was suffering from rhabdomyolysis , a rare condition which could have caused her kidneys to fail if left untreated			1
she spent four days in hospital on a drip and has been unable to return to work as a goldsmith since the session last month because her arms are still too weak			1
now miss @entity4 wants to warn others about the perils of over-exercising , which could prove life - threatening even with the support of a professional			1
miss @entity4 , who runs regularly , paid £ 40 for an hour - long session at the @entity33 gym near her home in @entity35			1
she said : ‘ i did pull - ups , weights , bench press - ups and found it incredibly hard going			2
‘ a few times i said to the personal trainer i was finding it tough and i did n’t know if i could carry on			1
' but he encouraged me to dig deep to do the best possible			0
as he was the professional , i did as he asked			0
i thought no pain , no gain			0
’ ‘ and although my arms felt like jelly at the end of it , i reassured myself that was just the result of a healthy workout			2
' when she woke the next day , miss @entity4 could barely move			1
‘ i was in such agony i could n’t straighten my arms			2
' it was difficult to work - i make jewellery for a living but my arms were so painful it was impossible to hold the tools			2
' at 3pm she went to the toilet and noticed her urine was tea coloured			0
‘ i now know this is a classic sign of rhabdomyolysis because it was full of blood , ’ she says , ‘ but then i just thought i must be dehydrated and drank more water			2
' by the evening miss @entity4 ’s arms had started to swell so she arranged to see an out - of - hours doctor			1
the 30 - year - old was admitted to hospital after an out - of - hours doctor took ' one look ' at her arms			1
she was placed on a drip for four days ‘ he took one look at my arms , and after testing my urine said i needed to go to hospital straight away , ’ she said			2
@entity79 is triggered when muscles start to break down during strenuous exercise , resulting in a toxic fluid leaking into the body which can cause the kidneys to fail			0
the condition often occurs in people injured in disasters such as earthquakes or bombings but is also caused by strenuous exercise and can occur in professional athletes who overdo it			0
it occurs when the muscles are damaged resulting in the muscle protein myoglobin leaking into the urine			0
a keen runner , @entity4 spent £ 40 on her one - hour session with the personal trainer at @entity33 in @entity35 the 30 - year - old said she feels ' very fortunate to be alive ' after the ordeal the toxic leaking fluid , which should never be in the blood , can damage the kidneys , which desperately try to filter it out or cause the heart to beat irregularly causing a cardiac arrest			1
treatment involves being put on a drip to flush out the toxins			0
@entity4 wants to warn others of the dangers of overdoing it at the gym ‘ when the doctors explained it can lead to potentially life threatening kidney failure , i realised how lucky i was i sought help when i did			1
i now feel incredibly fortunate to be alive			0
’ miss @entity4 said : ‘ i was stunned when they said that one hour ’s exercise had caused it			1
’ three weeks later her arms are still weak and she has been told it could be a month before full feeling returns			2
she has complained to @entity33 , saying trainers should be taught about the risk of pushing people to do too much too soon			0
she added : ‘ i do n’t personally blame the trainer			0
i just do n’t think any of them know about this condition			0
’ ‘ i can imagine lots of people are joining gyms to shape up to @entity133 and want to warn them of the dangers			2
’ a spokesman for @entity33 said : ‘ we take the health and well - being of our customers very seriously and we ’re really sorry that this happened to @entity4			1
‘ all our personal trainers are fully qualified			0
we understand that this particular condition is incredibly rare and can not be pre-screened for			0
‘ however , given the experience at @entity35 we have advised our teams to ensure they are fully aware of this			0
