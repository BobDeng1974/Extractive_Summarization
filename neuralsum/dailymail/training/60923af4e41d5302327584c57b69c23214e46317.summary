@entity0 has urged @entity1 to take a break from tennis rather than get straight back onto the practice court			1
the @entity6 ’s instinct when times are tough is to throw himself into hard work , and it was no different after his mauling by @entity10 at the @entity11			1
this would normally be the point in the season when @entity1 would take a short holiday before beginning his preparations for the new season at a training camp in @entity19			1
@entity1 was beaten 6 - 0 6 - 1 by @entity10 at the @entity11 on thursday in @entity20 the @entity6 took to @entity21 to apologise to his fans after being thrashed by the 33 - year - old @entity23 tennis legend @entity0 ( right ) has urged @entity1 not to rush back to the court following the defeat he already has a busier schedule than usual , with best - man duties next weekend at the wedding of @entity29 before a trip to @entity31 to play in the inaugural @entity32			1
following the 6 - 0 6 - 1 defeat by @entity10 , @entity1 took to @entity21 to apologise to his fans , and he said : ' i ’m not going to try and forget it			1
' when i think about what happened , i ’m not saying i ’m ever going to look at that match positively , but i need to use it as whatever			2
if it ’s motivation for the off - season , to make some changes to things			2
' i would normally take a break just now			2
but i also need time to work on some things in my game and make improvements			2
so if i was to take a two - week break just now , that ’s 14 days where i ca n’t work on my game , make any changes in that period			2
' i ’ll try to get back on the practice court probably sooner than i would have done			2
' @entity1 arrived at the @entity53 after playing for six successive weeks in order to qualify for the tournament and on the back of one of the most challenging seasons of his career			1
he did not have a break last winter because of the long process of recovering from back surgery , which lasted well into this season			2
@entity0 said : ' if he learns anything from @entity10 it should be that @entity10 ’s magnificent in forgetting devastating matches			1
that ’s not a tape you want to look at			0
' there ’s clearly a gap there , and part of it ’s what happened leading up to it			0
he ’s played too much and he seems to have not much left in the tank			0
' he looked tired , his legs looked heavy			0
if i was his coach , i would definitely tell him to take a break			2
' @entity10 came out firing and won the opening six games in just 24 minutes on thursday night the spotlight will shine intensely on all parts of @entity1 ’s game as well as his partnership with coach @entity90			1
the pair linked up ahead of @entity92 following @entity94 ’s departure from @entity1 ’s team in march			1
@entity90 ’s impact has inevitably been compared to that of @entity94 , who within nine months helped @entity1 win @entity99 gold and his first grand slam title at the @entity101			1
@entity1 said in @entity102 the success of his ground - breaking relationship with @entity90 could not be judged until at least the @entity105 because of the need to spend time working together away from the tour			1
@entity0 said : ' i do n’t know how much time something like that needs			1
i would not call it a roaring success but that does n’t mean it should not be given more time			0
' i was speaking to @entity94 and he said , for anything , it needs a year or two			0
if that ’s true , you ’ve got to give it more time			0
' @entity1 's coaches @entity123 ( left ) and @entity90 watch on during his defeat his partnership with @entity90 in particular will come under the spotlight after a disappointing season @entity1 has had some success late in the season , winning three titles and getting back to beating top - 10 players on a regular basis , which helped him climb from a low of number 12 in the rankings back to six			1
but victories over @entity10 , @entity139 and @entity140 have proved elusive , with @entity1 winning just three sets in nine defeats to his biggest rivals during 2014			1
asked how far away he feels from the trio , he said : “ well , after ( losing to @entity10 ) , that ’s quite clear			1
quite a long way from that level			0
' but a lot can change in a matter of weeks and months in tennis			0
@entity10 is a good example of that			1
obviously last year he was having some struggles and some tough times with his body			0
' a lot of questions were asked about him			0
he ’s responded and gone into the last tournament of the year with an opportunity to get to number one			0
' i ’m not happy to finish the year with that record , obviously			0
but hopefully next year , if i get the right work done now , i can get myself off to a good start			0
' over five sets , i ’ve tended to play , i would say , better tennis in my career			0
i hope that , come @entity168 , i ’ll be a much better player			0

@entity0 urges @entity1 not to return straight to the court
@entity1 was thrashed 6 - 0 6 - 1 by @entity10 in @entity11
the @entity6 took to @entity21 after the match in @entity20 to apologise to his fans
