a small @entity1 community got the shock of the season on saturday when a group of scantily clad gay @entity5 took their @entity7 parade route by storm			1
the @entity9 , an all gay dance team known for their provocative moves and outfits , were confused by the invitation to walk the @entity13 , @entity1 ( population 3,000 ) @entity7 parade but swayed and thrust their way through outraged crowds nonetheless			1
parade organizers have since apologized for including the @entity9 , but the five gentlemen from @entity20 think it was all just part of a day ’s work			1
‘ we were taking a risk , but we always do			0
’ the team arrived to @entity13 and lined up ready to march in fur - trimmed , snug - fitting @entity36 outfits			1
even as the gentleman , in full makeup and @entity36 hats , stripped off their sweat pants at the parade start , they raised some eyebrows			2
‘ i had no idea that they would be dressed the way they were and that they would think it 's appropriate for a community @entity7 parade , ’ said @entity53 , who helped plan the event			1
‘ their costumes and the style of dancing were inappropriate			1
’ the team specializes in @entity68 , a lead and follow style hip - hop dance style that involves movements some may find lurid or provocative			1
as they strutted their stuff through the parade ’s 1.7 mile stretch , many of those raised eyebrows deepened into scorn			0
' we were taking a risk , but we always do ' : the team got some confused and even scornful looks , but they saw its all in a day 's work prancing on : the @entity9 gained notoriety last summer after @entity87 shared a video of them on @entity89			1
they 've since had multiple national tv appearances ' vulgar ' : parade officials say they began getting irate phone calls from community members within hours of the parade @entity53 told @entity39 the team ’s dancing was ‘ vulgar ’ and ‘ not appropriate for a children 's @entity7 parade			1
’ she said outraged community members began to vent in phone calls and social media feeds within hours of the event and apologized on behalf of organizers			2
@entity105 , an advisor to the @entity9 , told @entity39 that the group was under the , apparently mistaken , impression @entity53 had seen them on @entity107			2
meanwhile , the @entity9 themselves are not apologizing on behalf of anyone			2
‘ it 's ok for a woman to put on tights and play football but when a man wants to put on leotard and tights , it 's a problem , ’ said @entity38			0
‘ we are no different than any team out there dancing			2
we want people to stop looking at gender and focus on the talent			0
’ not your average parade : the dance group is based in nearby @entity20 , @entity1 , where residents may have been a little less surprised than they were in small @entity13 while many of the folks of @entity13 were unable to appreciate it , the @entity9 ’ talents have been acknowledge in some notable places			1
in june , @entity87 took a liking one of their videos and tweeted it out			0
the video quickly gained some 200,000 views in just two days			0
since then , the group — which consists of @entity38 , @entity139 , 23 , @entity140 , 23 , @entity141 , 22 , and @entity142 , 22 — has appeared on the syndicated daytime talk show @entity144 , the @entity145 , and have auditioned for @entity146			0
in 2014 , they ’re slated to appear in several @entity149 parades and are even looking for some new talent in the form of men who are n’t afraid to show their moves , no matter who ’s watching			0
‘ i was trying to ( have ) tunnel vision , ’ @entity141 said of saturday ’s appearance			0
‘ it takes a lot to do what we do			0

the @entity20 , @entity1 - based @entity9 had *visitors* to the @entity7 parade *dropping* their jaws on saturday
the four - man , all gay dance team specializes in j - setting , a dance style some find provocative
' their costumes and the style of dancing were inappropriate ' : some members of the community of 3,000
