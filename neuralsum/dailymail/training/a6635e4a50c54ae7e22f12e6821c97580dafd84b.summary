a narrow third upon his return to action in the @entity51 at @entity52 , he went on to claim victories in the @entity27 and @entity54 , after which he won the @entity55 at @entity56			0

he said : ' at the beginning of the week we discovered a bit of soreness in the heel , which made us suspicious of a hoof abscess			0
' we poulticed away at it and the infection came out and there were no soundness issues at all			0
' then a couple of days later , he pulled out lame and , on inspection , we realised the infection had blown out through the bottom of the foot as well as the top			0
' in a case like that , it was going to take a couple of weeks for the stability to come back			0
