an angry @entity1 user has got his revenge on an unscrupulous seller who conned him out of £ 80 by sending the man the entire works of @entity7 via 29,000 text messages			1
@entity9 , a 24 - year - old from @entity10 , was furious when the @entity12 console he bought on @entity1 failed to arrive , so decided to get back at the seller by bombarding him with messages			1
the graphic designer wanted to the send the conman as many texts as possible , so started by copying and pasting @entity19 into 600 messages , @entity15 into 861 , and @entity21 into an irritating 1,143			1
revenge : @entity9 wanted to get back at the conman so started bombarding him with thousands of text messages containing the works of @entity7 technique : to send the messages , mr @entity9 simply copies the entire wording of each play using a single click on an app on his @entity32 , then pastes it into a text ( pictured ) mr @entity9 was able to send the messages at no expense as he is on a £ 37 - a - month unlimited contract with 02			1
the contract allows him to make as many calls or texts as he wants without paying anything extra			0
and sending the messages was not nearly as time consuming as it sounds , as mr @entity9 simply copies the entire text of each play using a single click on an app on his @entity32			1
he then pastes the full wording into a single message , which his phone automatically breaks down into 160 word segments while sending			0
@entity53 lengths : @entity9 says he is not a particularly avid fan of @entity7 but claims to now have ' a new appreciation ' for the @entity7 's works - especially the longer ones the messaging campaign began last thursday when the @entity12 console mr @entity9 purchased from a user calling himself ' @entity61 ' failed to arrive , and a demand for a refund went unanswered			1
as he had already paid the @entity65 - based seller the money through a direct bank transfer a week earlier , mr @entity9 had broken @entity1 's terms of service , so the website was unable to help			1
mr @entity9 claims that when he contacted the police , they told him that there was little hope of catching the conman			2
feeling helpess , he decided to send all 30,000 words written by @entity7 via text message			0
so far mr @entity9 has sent 22 plays including @entity21 , @entity19 and @entity79 which have been delivered in 17,424 texts			2
by the time he reaches the final play , mr @entity9 thinks he will have sent a total of 29,305 messages			1
the remaining 15 works will take another few days to send , meaning the conman 's phone will have been receiving a new text message every few seconds for almost a week by the time it has finished			2
speaking of his act of revenge , mr @entity9 said : ' i was really annoyed and i was trying to think of ways of being more in the position of power because i felt so helpless about it			2
' ' my first thought was that i could try and pretend i had found out where he lived but it was all a bit of a cliche and it was n’t going to worry him really			0
' then it just occurred to me you can copy and paste things from the internet and into a text message			0
' it got me thinking , ‘ what can i sent to him ’ which turned to ‘ what is a really long book ’ , which ended with me sending him @entity19			0
' since sending the messages , mr @entity9 has started receiving abusive responses from the seller			1
con : @entity9 was furious when the @entity12 console ( pictured ) he bought on @entity1 failed to arrive , so decided to get back at the seller by bombarding him with messages ' i got the first reply after an hour , and then a few more abusive messages after that , ' he said			1
' recently he has taken to calling me and giving me abuse on the phone			0
i tried to ask him if he was enjoying the plays , but he was very confused			0
' ' i ’m going to keep doing it			0
if nothing else i ’m sharing a little bit of culture with someone who probably does n’t have much experience of it			0
