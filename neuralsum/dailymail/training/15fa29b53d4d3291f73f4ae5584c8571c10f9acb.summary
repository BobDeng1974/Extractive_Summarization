a computer program that taught itself to play poker has created nearly the best possible strategy for one version of the game , showing the value of techniques that may prove useful to help decision - making in medicine and other areas			2
the program considered 24 trillion simulated poker hands per second for two months , probably playing more poker than all humanity has ever experienced , says @entity13 , who led the project			0
the resulting strategy still wo n't win every game because of bad luck in the cards			1
but over the long run — thousands of games — it wo n't lose money			1
" we can go against the best ( players ) in the world and the humans are going to be the ones that lose money , " said @entity13 , of the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25			2
a computer program that taught itself to play poker has created nearly the best possible strategy for one version of the game , showing the value of techniques that may prove useful for real - world challenges the strategy applies specifically to a game called heads - up limit @entity41 ' em. while scientists have created poker - playing programs for years , @entity13 's result stands out because it comes so close to " solving " its version of the game , which essentially means creating the optimal strategy			1
poker is hard to solve because it involves imperfect information , where a player does n't know everything that has happened in the game he is playing — specifically , what cards the opponent has been dealt			1
many real - world challenges like negotiations and auctions also include imperfect information , which is one reason why poker has long been a proving ground for the mathematical approach to decision - making called game theory			1
@entity64 of @entity65 in @entity66 , who did n't participate in the new work , called @entity69 's results a landmark			0
he said it 's the first time that an imperfect - information game that is competitively played by people has been essentially solved			2
@entity13 's paper , released thursday by the journal @entity76 , introduces some techniques that could become useful for applying game theory in real - world situations			1
@entity13 is investigating the possibility of helping doctors determine proper insulin doses for diabetic patients , for example			1
poker is hard to solve because it involves imperfect information , where a player does n't know everything that has happened in the game he is playing — specifically , what cards the opponent has been dealt game theory has also been used to schedule security patrols , and it has implications for other areas like developing strategies for cybersecurity , designing drugs and fighting disease pandemics			1
but @entity13 doubts the poker strategy will let anybody make a fortune on the game itself			0
the kind of poker it applies to has waned in popularity over the past seven years or so , he said			0
even online , the stakes tend to be small and " you 'd be winning a few dollars , not raking in millions			0
" in the two - player game , each contestant creates a poker hand from two cards he is dealt face - down plus five other cards placed on the table face - up			0
players place bets before the face - up cards are laid out , and then again as each card is revealed			0
the size of the wagers is fixed			0
@entity13 said the computer 's strategy is far too complicated for anybody to memorize , with about 1,000 times the amount of information in the english - language @entity128			2
but his university has created a website where people can ask it for advice and even play against it .			0
