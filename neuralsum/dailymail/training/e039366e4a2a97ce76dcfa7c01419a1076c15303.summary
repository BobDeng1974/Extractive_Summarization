goalkeeper @entity0 is happy for @entity1 to win ugly , but knows they can not afford too many costly defensive lapses if they are to challenge for the @entity4 title			1
the @entity5 came from behind to beat @entity6 2 - 1 at the @entity7 on saturday through a dramatic stoppage - time winner from @entity9 , which denied the @entity11 what would have been a well - deserved share of the points on the opening day of the new campaign			1
despite all of their attacking potential @entity1 were again undone by some all - too - familiar slack defending , with @entity19 heading home a near - post corner into the unguarded opposite side of the goal			1
finally though @entity1 were able to open up the visitors , who were reduced to 10 men after a second caution for winger @entity41			2
@entity43 's shot from a knockdown by substitute @entity45 was saved by @entity46 , only for @entity9 to lash the loose ball in from close range			0
' maybe it was not the most beautiful of games , going 1 - 0 down we had to respond , but we will take the three points , ' @entity0 said			1
defence : @entity0 said he was disappointed to concede from a set piece ' we conceded to another set - piece which was not very good , although it was a good delivery and a great header , so that is something we can hopefully improve on			1
' @entity35 showed some positive touches , albeit without setting the match alight			2
@entity24 is confident the @entity63 forward will soon grow into his new surroundings			2
' i am very happy with his attitude because he kept on fighting for 90 minutes , even if he is not completely ready physically , ' said the @entity1 manager			2
' tactically he needs to improve his understanding with his partners but he looked lively and dangerous until the end			0
adjusting : @entity24 said he is pleased with how @entity35 is settling in at @entity1 ' i am happy with his overall attitude and performance			1
' @entity1 , who are said to be closing in on @entity76 centre - back @entity74 , head to @entity77 on monday ahead of their @entity79 play - off first leg against @entity80			1
full - back @entity81 will be assessed after limping off early in the second half with what looked like a hamstring problem			0
midfielder @entity86 missed the @entity6 match through illness but could yet be well enough to travel			0
injury : @entity81 limped off with what looked like a hamstring injury at the emirates @entity0 is confident @entity1 can get a positive result at the @entity94 , having beaten @entity95 3 - 0 in @entity77 at the same stage of the competition last season			1
' we love important games , so we ca n't wait to go to @entity101			0
it will be a good atmosphere , ' the @entity103 goalkeeper said			0
' we did really well in @entity77 last season , so will be out to do the same thing over again			0
' the crowd is fantastic for the home team but they were out there last year too , so hopefully we can do it again			0
