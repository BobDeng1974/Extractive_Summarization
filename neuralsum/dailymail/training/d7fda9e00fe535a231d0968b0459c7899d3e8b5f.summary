last year it was all about the ramen burger			0
but one month into 2015 and @entity2 already has a new it sandwich			2
@entity4 , the @entity7 - @entity6 restaurant at @entity10 's @entity9 outpost in @entity11 , has been selling up to 100 of its $ 13 spaghetti sandwiches per day since it was listed on the menu a week ago			1
the dish sees spaghetti in a tomato - garlic sauce take the place of a patty			1
the noodles are mixed with pecorino cheese then coated in egg and baked in a blini pan to hold them together			0
' we serve it on a toasted onion roll with extremely delicious garlic butter and a layer of chopped @entity39 salad with red pepper flakes			1
' of course , this is no diet food			0
@entity43 - loading aside , the spaghetti sandwich packs a punch in terms of calories too			1
a member of staff at the restaurant told us that they try to fit as much between the bread as possible			0
this equates to around an appetizer - sized portion of pasta ( 420 calories according to @entity58 ) and the same of salad ( 204 calories )			2
add the bun ( 150 calories ) , pecorino ( 20 calories ) a generous lick of garlic butter ( 102 calories ) and a side of potato chips ( 160 calories ) and the total calories are a shade over 1,000			1
the concept of the spaghetti sandwich is not actually a new one			1
the brainchild of restaurant owner @entity78 , it was originally listed on the menu four years ago - much to the chefs ' disdain			0
' we cooks all kind of scoffed at the idea , ' mr @entity27 told the @entity32			0
' but he was right ; it 's very , very good			0
' the spaghetti sandwich fell off the menu a year ago after the restaurant decided to focus more on seasonal ingredients , but following a surge of complaints from regulars , it was reinstated last month			2
@entity43 - on - carb - on - carb : the spaghetti patty is served on an onion bun with garlic butter and @entity39 salad with homemade potato chips and pickles on the side and the demand has been unprecedented , mr @entity27 says : ' it 's been insane			1
we 'll get get a ticket to fire up seven at a time for one table , and then another will come in , and another			0
' in the interests of research , the @entity106 team took a trip to @entity11 in order to put the sandwich to the test			1
a little wary of the heavy carb - on - carb action , we figured one sandwich between two would suffice			2
in fact , it turned out to be carb - on - carb - on - carb as the sandwich was served with homemade potato chips			1
but one bite in and we were both sold			0
the combination of textures made perfect sense in reality , if not in concept			0
back by popular demand : the spaghetti sandwich fell off the menu a year ago after the restaurant decided to focus more on seasonal ingredients , but following a surge of complaints , it was reinstated last month ' it was so much tastier than i was expecting , ' said @entity133 , @entity106 's @entity134 assistant editor			1
' and it was n't anywhere near as " carby " as i thought it would be either			0
the tomato sauce was delicious , and the tangy @entity39 dressing really helped to cut through the carbs while adding an extra flavor dimension to the overall taste			2
' daters beware though - the spaghetti sandwich is is not a first date dish			1
' maybe save it for the third ? ' @entity133 suggested			0
' it was incredibly messy to eat , but well worth the tomato stains on my cheeks - and something i would actually eat again			2
