by @entity0 published : 17:17 est , 12 march 2012 updated : 19:47 est , 13 march 2012 if you are reliant on your smartphone for directions , then be prepared to brush up with a map and compass if vacation plans include a trip to @entity8 , @entity9			1
the remote town , sitting high in the desert mountains close to the @entity12 , has an excruciatingly slow internet connection , scant cellphone signal and the dubious honor of becoming one of last places in @entity18 not to be hooked up with broadband			1
a census from 2010 , found the town to have just 43 residents across 28 households - and no one under the age of 18			2
the town sign claimed 50 people lived in @entity8 - but no one can verify this as the plaque has been stolen			1
snail mail : with no broadband connection in @entity8 , @entity9 the residents must make do with the postal service or excruciatingly slow dial - up connections the back of beyond : abandoned cars litter the small community of @entity8 where most people live in trailers or reclaimed mining shacks only 3 per cent of @entity18 must make do with a dial - up internet connection these days and the few citizens of @entity8 are among them , according to the @entity43			1
@entity44 , 67 , who has lived in @entity8 since the @entity45 , told the @entity46 that he accepted sacrifices must be made when you live somewhere as remote - and with such unspoiled natural beauty - as @entity50			1
however he then told the @entity46 : ' i understand that you have to give up certain things to live in a beautiful area like this			0
' but i did n't move here to get away from everybody			0
' the town was established by @entity18 explorer dr @entity59 in 1874 after he discovered silver ore deposits in the mountains , just south of @entity12			1
ghost town : @entity50 claims to have 50 residents - although a 2010 census reported just 43			0
although no one knows exactly as this sign has been stolen from the highway @entity70 land : at the height of its mining boom in the late 19th century around 700 people lived in the town of @entity8 @entity9 dreaming : @entity50 can be hard to find because the town no longer has a sign after it was stolen - and cellphone reception is non-existent just a year later , 700 people were found living in the town where around 20 mines were discovered - the population peaked in 1877 at several thousand @entity82 its heyday , @entity50 was buzzing with saloon bars , general stores and brothels			2
in many other ghost towns across the @entity18 , when the industry has died , life in the town has also disappeared			0
however in @entity8 , a small community of artists and those preferring life in the wilderness , has remained			1
the population is made up of mainly couples and no one under the age of 18 lives in the beauty spot			0
there are no stores to buy anything and nowhere to stay - the nearest supermarket is 90 miles away			0
the small community has only a local post office where residents can gather to pass the time of day			2
and even this is in danger of closing next year			0
residents have asked their internet provider @entity112 to install broadband in the town but for now , the cost outweighs the demand for the company			0
there are government plans to extend broadband to more remote areas across the @entity18 by next year - but @entity50 still remains too far out			2
keeping a sense of humour : an ' @entity8 ' sign is pinned to the ramshackle home with a few plastic seats for residents on the road : the nearest supermarket to @entity8 is 90 miles away - and internet shopping is nearly impossible for residents because of the slow internet connection free spirits : @entity50 has attracted a small community of artists and those who prefer to live on the edge of civilization going nowhere fast : @entity50 sits high in the desert mountains close to the @entity12			1

the remote community of @entity8 is in the desert mountains close to the @entity12
