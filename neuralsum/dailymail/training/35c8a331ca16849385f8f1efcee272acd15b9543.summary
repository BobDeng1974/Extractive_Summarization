dame @entity137 , 54 , looked stunning in a floor - length dress with a fish tail hem @entity163 : ' i love seeing women over 50 on the red carpets because what you see really is their true style			1
' the younger stars are very much led by stylists , designers befriending them for one reason , and pushy @entity174 throwing dresses at them , sometimes in exchange for money			0
' but it 's only when you reach a certain age that you become comfortable in your skin , and are not ' trend ' led			2
' @entity154 added that none of the actresses had been held back their age and says that they could teach people a thing or two about red carpet style			2
dress for your body shape : highlight the body parts you are happy with ( an interesting neckline , straps if you have good shoulders , ruched at the waist to draw the eye in to the smallest part )			0
colour is key too : play up to pale in a standout colour , or just chose black for a bit of chic			2
and sparkles can be a women 's best friend			0
