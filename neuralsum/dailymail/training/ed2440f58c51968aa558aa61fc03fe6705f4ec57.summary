by @entity0 published : 16:11 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 29 march 2013 to say i was in awe of @entity3 the day i met him would be an understatement ; i was a still - wet - behind - the - ears television scriptwriter , whereas @entity3 was one of the biggest comedy stars in the country			1
what would i say to him ? would i be able to say anything , or would the words stick in my mouth ? i need n't have worried			1
he had no airs and graces , no edge , nothing of the ' @entity21 ' about him ; he was exactly the man viewers saw on their tv screens , and from the moment we shook hands it was like being with someone i 'd known all my life			1
it remained that way for the six years i spent providing him with many of the gags he used on his shows , the rough pebbles that became polished gemstones once he 'd added his perfect inflection and delivery to them			1
@entity3 as @entity42 and @entity43 as @entity44 in @entity45 & @entity46 we 'd been brought together by chance			1
the @entity8 producer @entity48 had been handed the task of producing what would be @entity3 's first solo series since joining the @entity52 from @entity53 the year previously			1
in its wisdom the @entity52 , rather than relying on tried - and - trusted scriptwriters , had decided to try out four new writers to provide the scripts for what was to be @entity59			1
they were @entity61 , @entity63 - @entity62 , @entity64 and myself			1
i was treated to an example of @entity68 wit when it became apparent that @entity63 and @entity64 were n't coming up with the sort of material that suited @entity3			1
at a script conference , @entity48 said to @entity3 , ' oh by the way , i 've had to let @entity62 and @entity64 go			1
' @entity76 as a flash , @entity3 replied , ' well , that 's got rid of four of them			1
' @entity78 and @entity79 in the new play by the time it had become the @entity82 , i was the sole writer apart from @entity3 himself			2
i wrote the sketches and @entity3 wrote the stand - up , and we each chipped in with ideas for both			1
of course , some of the best - loved moments were the @entity92 sketches , and the intriguing history behind them formed the starting point for our new play			2
the gossiping old housewives came about through improvisation when @entity3 was with @entity98 doing @entity3 years earlier			1
he was a big fan of music - hall legend @entity99 , famous for dressing up as an ' @entity42 ' type woman for his @entity102 ' act , and between takes @entity3 and his @entity104 co-star @entity43 would make up bits with each other as @entity99 - type women			2
the sketch was resurrected on the @entity52 at my suggestion because i knew , perhaps more than @entity3 did , just how popular it would be			2
the way it worked is that i would write the sketch and while we were rehearsing it @entity3 would throw in the odd line ( between you and me , it was usually one he 'd used in the past and he knew would get a laugh ) and @entity43 would do likewise			2
i 'd sometimes add something myself , or suggest an alteration if it was n't quite working			2
when @entity124 , creative producer at the @entity125 in @entity126 , noticed the discrepancies between my original scripts and the televised footage while researching @entity3 's career , he decided to try and track the artistic journey of all the sketches - including the heated discussions that took place - and the play reveals what he discovered			1
it not only captures the nostalgia of the pieces , but the backstage antics that went on while they were being created			2
@entity3 was ' exactly the man viewers saw on their tv screens ' , known for his ad - libbing and generous spirit so , what was working with such a comedy legend really like ? on the first run - through of a sketch , @entity3 would always be word perfect			2
initially i thought it was because he 'd taken great pains to learn the script , but the truth was he had an almost photographic memory and only had to read a script once to retain about 90 per cent of it			0
and the ten per cent he did n't retain he would fill in with his own ad - libs - which were often funnier than the words he 'd forgotten			0
although @entity3 knew his lines , this was n't to say rehearsals were a pleasurable experience for me			0
traumatic would be a better description			0
the way it went was that @entity3 and his co-stars would act out a sketch			0
@entity3 's performance would be nigh - on perfect			0
minutes later , after a few suggestions from the producer , the cast would do the sketch again			0
this time @entity3 would perform his part in an entirely different way and usually not nearly so well			0
@entity3 as @entity42 and @entity43 as @entity44 on the @entity82 by the time the actors had rehearsed the sketch for a fourth or fifth time @entity3 's performance had diminished to truly abysmal			1
the truth , it eventually dawned on me , was that @entity3 quickly became bored and was trying to relieve the tedium of doing it again and again ! in his mind he 'd already done it the way he meant to and had no intention of doing it the same way again until it really mattered - the performance to the studio audience on recording night			0
i have one abiding memory of @entity3 that demonstrates the man 's generosity of spirit			0
it was a recording night and , with the audience settled in their seats for the 7.30pm start , @entity3 was nowhere to be seen			0
search parties were sent out to all four corners of @entity204			0
the star of the show was eventually run to ground in the @entity52 canteen telling jokes to two cleaning ladies			0
the pa who found him said , ' @entity3 , for @entity216 's sake , there 's an audience of 300 waiting for the show to start			0
' @entity3 , without showing the slightest concern , said , ' make that 302 , ' turned to the cleaning ladies and said , ' follow me , girls			0
' and they did , to seats on the front row			0
@entity44 : an hysterical @entity225 is at the @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity226 , until 6 april			1
for tickets , tel : 020 8507 5607 or visit @entity228			0

@entity0 wrote @entity44 & @entity231 scripts for six years
@entity44 : an hysterical @entity225 is at the @entity125 , @entity126
