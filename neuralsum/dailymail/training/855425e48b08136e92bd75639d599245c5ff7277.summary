a new study indicates that @entity1 gained up to 15 iq points after the addition of iodine to salt became mandatory			1
in an effort to prevent goiter related to iodine deficiency , authorities ruled that iodine be added to @entity1 salt products in 1924			1
the iodine , in addition to eliminating goiter , appears to have had an unexpected result : smarter @entity1			2
worth its salt : iodized salt has had an unexpected impact the iq of @entity1 since it was introduced in 1924 in a report published in the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 examined data from about two million enlistees for @entity28 born between 1921 and 1927 , comparing the intelligence levels of those born just before 1924 and those born just after			1
to do this , they looked to standardized iq tests that each recruit took as a part of the enlistment process			0
while the researchers did n't have access to the test scores themselves , they had another way of gauging intelligence levels : smarter recruits were sent to the @entity45 , while the less intelligent ones were assigned to the @entity47			0
@entity48 : communities by the ocean are much less likely to suffer iodine deficiency due to the high levels of iodine found in seafood , and other foods grown in iodine - rich soil next , the economists worked out likely iodine levels in different cities and towns around @entity1 using statistics gathered after @entity62 on the occurrence of goiter			1
matching the recruits with their hometowns showed researchers that the men from low - iodine areas made a huge leap in iq after the introduction of iodine			2
the men born in low - iodine areas after 1924 were much more likely to get into the @entity75 and had an average iq that was 15 points above that of their slightly older comrades			1
necessary nutrient : while it 's a mandatory addition to table salt , many sea salts and kosher salts do n't have iodine added this averages out to a 3.5 point rise in @entity20 levels across the nation			0
the @entity89 backed up these results saying : ' for iodine - deficient communities , between 10 and 15 iq points may be lost when compared to similar but non-iodine - deficient populations			1
' @entity94 comes from food sources , and is especially abundant in seafood and foods grown in coastal areas with high levels of iodine in the soil			0
mountainous and inland areas are often very low in the nutrient , meaning food grown there does n't have enough iodine			0
today , iodine deficiency is the leading cause of preventable mental retardation in the world			1
the condition , known as cretinism , was also common in the @entity1 until the introduction of iodized salt			2
originally , @entity1 authorities wanted to reduce the incidence of goiter , but research since that time has shown that iodine plays an important role in brain development , especially during gestation			0
the @entity89 estimates that two billion people worldwide are at risk of iodine deficiency			2
and it 's not just a @entity128 problem - the @entity89 reports that only 27 per cent of households in @entity130 have access to iodized salt			0
the researchers say that iodine may also be a cause of the so - called @entity136 , the steady rise in iq that 's been ongoing since the 1930s .			0

the @entity1 introduced iodized salt in 1924
a new study compares iq results of people in iodine deficient areas before and after iodized salt
@entity1 born in iodine deficient areas showed an @entity20 increase of 15 points after 1924
iodine deficiency causes goiter and mental and *physical* retardation in *infants*
