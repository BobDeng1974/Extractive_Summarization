by @entity0 almost two million soldiers lost their lives fighting for @entity3 in the two world wars			1
over the course of ten years , death struck every city , town and village across the nation ... except for 13			0
incredibly , the handful of settlements known as the ' @entity13 ' welcomed home every single one of their boys safely - twice			0
memories : a headstone in the graveyard of @entity21 's church in the ' @entity13 ' village of @entity23 , @entity24 - the only reminder of those who survived both wars soldiers : this photograph taken during the @entity30 , shows private @entity31 ( front row , second left ) who was from the village of @entity35 , @entity36 family : @entity38 ( left ) holds the service medals that belonged to his father @entity40 , in the ' @entity13 ' village of @entity42 , @entity43			1
pictured right is the family in the 1940s , including @entity51 ( right ) , his father @entity48 ( second right ) , grandmother @entity44 ( front ) , sister @entity46 ( second left ) and a housekeeper			0
the communities span the length and breadth of @entity55 and @entity56 - from @entity35 in @entity36 to @entity23 in @entity24			0
but though some were struck by bombs - losing a house , shop or church - they did not lose one human life			0
many still live in the same village			0
former boy soldier @entity65 , who signed up to serve in the @entity66 aged just 15 , still lives in the doubly thankful village of @entity68 in @entity69			2
medallions : former boy soldier @entity65 , aged 15 , who served in the @entity66 still lives in the ' @entity13 ' village of @entity68 in @entity69 a century on , @entity72 is a discreet affair in the villages such as @entity68 in @entity69 and @entity74 in @entity75			1
as the rest of the country - and the entirety of @entity80 and @entity81 - mourns the millions that paid the ultimate sacrifice , the doubly thankful residents quietly celebrate their gratefulness			0
the name for the villages was first coined by celebrated writer @entity87 , who used ' @entity88 ' as a category in his 1933 encyclopedia titled @entity91 's @entity55			1
he wrote that a @entity88 was one which lost no men in the @entity30			2
remembrance : @entity96 looks at a picture of her father , private @entity98 , who came from the village of @entity101 , @entity102 then and now : villages of @entity68 in @entity69 ( left ) and @entity42 in @entity43 ( right ) are both pictured in the early 1900s ( top ) and as they looks now in 2014 ( bottom ) reflection : @entity107 remembers her father , private @entity31 , who served in the @entity30 and lived in recognised village of @entity35 in @entity36 in 1945 , the list was revised and it was found that 13 of the 32 had once again celebrated the return of every resident			1
each troop from @entity80 and @entity81 lost a soldier in the @entity30			0
the villages are : @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity116 in @entity102 , @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 in @entity75 , @entity124 in @entity125 and @entity126 in @entity118			1
treasured photograph : @entity107 holds a picture of her father , private @entity31 , who served in the @entity30 grazing : sheep surround a bench outside the church in @entity101 , @entity102			2
the village is one of 13 where all soldiers sent to both world wars returned safely never forget : a roll of honour with names of men who returned safely from @entity30 hangs in @entity116 church in @entity101 , @entity102 , and ( right ) a dedicated plaque hangs on the wall of @entity144 in @entity117 , @entity118 the base of a lantern built to remember the service personnel who returned from the @entity30 in @entity119 in @entity120			1

two million @entity3 soldiers died fighting in @entity30 and @entity66 , but none from 13 villages
writer @entity87 coined the *phrase* ' doubly @entity88 ' to categorise them in his encyclopedia of @entity3
the villages span the entire nation , from @entity69 and @entity102 to @entity75 to @entity24 and @entity122
