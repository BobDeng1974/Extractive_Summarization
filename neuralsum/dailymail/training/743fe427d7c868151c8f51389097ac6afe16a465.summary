a stone bridge reputed to be 3,000 years old was swept away as flooding continued to bring chaos to parts of @entity4 yesterday			1
downpours over the @entity7 break and through @entity8 are likely to ensure 2012 was one of the wettest years on record			2
as celebrations began , more than an inch and a quarter of rain was dumped on to already saturated ground and more than 200 flood alerts and 90 flood warnings were in place			1
@entity23 and his lurcher , @entity24 , ( pictured here ) on what remains of @entity27 the bridge as it looked before the floodwater caused it to collapse the @entity31 in @entity32 swelled so much that it destroyed the ‘ @entity27 ’ – a grade i listed ancient monument formed of massive stones weighing up to two tons apiece			1
the slabs , some measuring 8ft long , were swept away as downed trees crashed into them			1
local resident @entity23 said : ‘ i have lived in the area for over 50 years and i have never seen anything like this before			2
‘ it must have been some mighty trees which were carried downstream and smashed through them			1
’ the bridge links the @entity32 villages of @entity48 and @entity49			1
it was last damaged in floods in 1952 when the stone slabs were washed up to 50ft downstream and had to be recovered			1
since then the slabs have been numbered to aid reassembly			1
gone : two men look at the remains of the @entity27 clapper bridge which was washed away although the first recorded mention of the @entity27 was in the 14th century , some believe it could be far older millions are facing a difficult return to work tomorrow after the @entity7 break , with numerous roads left potholed and damaged by the weather			2
the only good news is that forecasters believe the first month of the new year will be considerably drier – if colder – than november and december			2
the @entity67 had been braced for the worst of the flooding , but there were similar fears elsewhere too			2
mobile flood barriers were set up in cities and towns including @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
larger rivers such as the @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 are likely remain high for several days			2
along @entity85 ’s @entity84 , sections of cliff threatened to slide towards the sea at the weekend , threatening beach chalets and creating a risk for beach - goers and fossil hunters			1
@entity93 coastguard @entity91 said : ‘ the amount of rain we ’ve had recently is turning parts of the cliff into a potentially dangerous porridge			0
’ there were fears that a woman whose body was pulled from the sea at a ferry terminal in @entity106 yesterday had been a victim of the weather			0
@entity110 flood risk manager @entity108 said : ‘ it is as important as ever to be prepared for flooding , keep up to date with the latest warnings and , if you are at risk , to move valuable items to safety			1
’ @entity118 has already suffered its wettest year since records began in 1910 , with 43.1in falling between january 1 and @entity120			0
the @entity121 said 1.8 inches of rain on the last day of the year would set a new @entity4 record – although final confirmation is not expected until next week			0
after all the rain , however , the start to the new year is expected to be relatively calm , with only light winds and localised showers in the @entity67			0
@entity121 forecaster @entity128 said : ‘ as of tomorrow , the weather will get nicer			0
there will be showers around here and there , but because of high pressure building from the @entity67 we can expect calmer , drier conditions from tomorrow across the @entity4			0
' it is sure to provide welcome respite from the unsettled weather we saw throughout december , and indeed the whole of 2012			0
‘ in january , the temperature will initially be above average , before getting a little colder and moving closer the average towards the middle of the month			0
’ legend has it that the devil built the bridge at @entity27 and had rights over sunbathing on the stones			0
anyone who tried to cross the bridge , it was said , did so at the risk that they would be killed by the devil , who swore an oath to crush anyone who passed from one side to the other			0
it is claimed that locals once sent a cat across the bridge to test the myth – and the animal was vaporised			0
only after confrontation with the local parson is the devil supposed to have withdrawn the threat			0
the first recorded mention of the @entity27 was in the 14th century – but some experts believe the bridge could date back to 1000 bc. it is constructed of stone slabs supported on stone piers , which stick three feet out of the water when the river is at its normal level			1
the name ‘ @entity181 ’ is thought to have derived from the @entity183 word ‘ tochar ’ for causeway			0
