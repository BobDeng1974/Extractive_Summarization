a @entity2 soldier fired shots , made death threats and hit @entity6 prisoners after they were captured on the battlefield , an inquiry into alleged war crimes has heard			0
he is accused of inflicting the abuse while questioning nine detainees at @entity13 ( above ) , a @entity2 base in southern @entity6 , in may 2004 but he told the long - running @entity33 that he ' categorically denied ' striking or physically threatening any of the prisoners			1
the soldier , who served in the @entity36 for 24 years , has been accused by several @entity6 captives of firing two pistol shots into the ground while they were being questioned in a tent at the military camp			1
there were also allegations by a detainee that @entity14 beat him with a metal pipe and another claimed he was warned he would be executed if he did not tell the truth			1
he said : ' it is a complete fabrication to say that two shots were fired			0
i never fired a weapon or allowed anyone else to fire a weapon in the tactical questioning tent			1
' there is no feasible way that a shot could be fired in the tent without someone hearing it and it being reported and discussed throughout the camp			0
' i categorically deny ever hitting any of the detainees , nor did i see any other soldiers beat and / or kick any detainees			2
i did not threaten a detainee with execution			0
' retired high court judge sir @entity67 is examining allegations that @entity2 troops executed up to 20 prisoners , including a 14 - year - old boy , and mistreated nine others after a battle at an @entity36 checkpoint			2
the inquiry is named after 19 - year - old @entity76 , one of those who died after a firefight between @entity2 soldiers and insurgents at the @entity82 checkpoint three miles north of the town of @entity84			1
the inquiry is looking at claims that @entity6 were unlawfully killed at @entity13 and that five @entity6 detainees were tortured and ill - treated there , and at a detention facility at @entity89 ( above , file picture ) it is looking at claims that @entity6 were unlawfully killed at @entity13 and that five @entity6 detainees were tortured and ill - treated there , and at a detention facility at @entity89			1
the claims have been strenuously denied by the @entity94 which says the victims were insurgents killed in battle			2
@entity14 had no involvement with the deaths of any @entity6 during the disputed events of may 14 , 2004			1
his evidence is confined to the treatment of detainees			2
he had carried out the ' tactical questioning ' of all nine detainees in the aftermath of the battle			1
each interrogation lasted up to 17 minutes			0
the witness said the tent peg was never used to strike a detainee but he said banging it on a table behind the prisoner was intended to scare them and ' soften ' them up			0
he said a questioning technique called ' harshing ' routinely involved walking behind the detainee , blowing on the back of their neck , banging the tent peg down on the table and then screaming and shouting over their left shoulder and into their ear			2
blowing on the detainee 's neck allowed the interrogator to get inside the prisoner 's personal space so that he could feel the questioner 's presence , something which was ' remarkably effective ' he said			0
the aim was to keep detainees in a state of uncertainty so they would not feel too comfortable and clam up			2
questioners were trying to discover information about insurgent weapons , armed gangs and planned attacks on @entity2 troops			0
but @entity14 told the counsel to the inquiry that he did not believe some of the tactics would be ' permissible ' today because the rules had been changed			1
the hearing , in central @entity151 , has already heard evidence from @entity6 , including relatives and medical staff , and military personnel			0
evidence from military witnesses will continue until march			0
it is hoped the inquiry report will be finished by the end of the year .			0
