facing bankruptcy , the @entity0 is pushing ahead with unprecedented cuts to first - class mail next spring that will slow delivery and , for the first time in 40 years , eliminate the chance for stamped letters to arrive the next day			1
the estimated $ 3billion in reductions , to be announced in broader detail on monday , are part of a wide - ranging effort by the cash - strapped @entity0 to quickly trim costs , seeing no immediate help from @entity15			2
the changes would provide short - term relief , but ultimately could prove counterproductive , pushing more of @entity19 's business onto the @entity20			0
save our post : nearly 100,000 postal workers could lose their jobs in an unprecedented budget cut that would also halt next - day mail they could slow everything from check payments to @entity29 's dvds - by - mail , add costs to mail - order prescription drugs , and threaten the existence of newspapers and time - sensitive magazines delivered by postal carrier to far - flung suburban and rural communities			1
that birthday card mailed first - class to @entity40 also could arrive a day or two late , if people do n't plan ahead			2
' it 's a potentially major change , but i do n't think consumers are focused on it and it wo n't register until the service goes away , ' said @entity48 , analyst with @entity49 , who tracks the shipping industry			0
' over time , to the extent the customer service experience gets worse , it will only increase the shift away from mail to alternatives			2
' the cuts , now being finalized , would close roughly 250 of the nearly 500 mail processing centres across the country as early as next march			1
because the consolidations typically would lengthen the distance mail travels from post office to processing centre , the agency also would lower delivery standards for first - class mail that have been in place since 1971			1
currently , first - class mail is supposed to be delivered to homes and businesses within the continental @entity19 in one day to three days			1
that will lengthen to two days to three days , meaning mailers no longer could expect next - day delivery in surrounding communities			1
periodicals could take between two days and nine days			0
deliver the letter : first - class mail will experience the downgrade as early as march in certain areas about 42 per cent of first - class mail is now delivered the following day			1
an additional 27 per cent arrives in two days , about 31 per cent in three days and less than 1 per cent in four days to five days			0
following the change next spring , about 51 per cent of all first - class mail is expected to arrive in two days , with most of the remainder delivered in three days			2
' the things i have control over here at the @entity0 , we have to do			0
if we do nothing , we will have a death spiral			0
' - postmaster general @entity92 the consolidation of mail processing centres is in addition to the planned closing of about 3,700 local post offices			1
in all , roughly 100,000 postal employees could be cut as a result of the various closures , resulting in savings of up to $ 6.5billion a year			1
expressing urgency to reduce costs , postmaster general @entity92 said in an interview that the agency has to act while waiting for @entity15 to grant it authority to reduce delivery to five days a week , raise stamp prices and reduce health care and other labour costs			0
the @entity0 , an independent agency of government , does not receive tax money , but is subject to congressional control on large aspects of its operations			0
the changes in first - class mail delivery can go into place without permission from @entity15			1
better late than never : time - sensitive materials like mailers and prescription drugs would take two to nine days to deliver if the new plan takes effect after five years in the red , the post office faces imminent default this month on a $ 5.5billion annual payment to the @entity130 for retiree health benefits			1
it is projected to have a record loss of $ 14.1billion next year amid steady declines in first - class mail volume			1
mr @entity92 has said the agency must make cuts of $ 20 billion by 2015 to be profitable			2
it already has announced a 1 - cent increase in first - class mail to 45 cents beginning january 22			1
' we have a business model that is failing			0
you ca n't continue to run red ink and not make changes , ' mr @entity92 said			0
' we know our business , and we listen to our customers			0
customers are looking for affordable and consistent mail service , and they do not want us to take tax money			0
' separate bills that have passed @entity153 and @entity154 committees would give the @entity0 more authority and liquidity to stave off immediate bankruptcy			0
but prospects are somewhat dim for final congressional action on those bills anytime soon , especially if the measures are seen in an election year as promoting layoffs and cuts to neighbourhood post offices			2
industries hurt : @entity29 , which delivers movies to some of its customers , could potentially suffer from the lag in mail delivery technically , the @entity0 must await an advisory opinion from the independent @entity172 before it can begin closing local post offices and processing centres			1
but such opinions are nonbinding , and mr @entity92 is making clear the agency will proceed with reductions once the opinion is released next march			0
' the things i have control over here at the @entity0 , we have to do , ' he said , describing the cuts as a necessary business decision			2
' if we do nothing , we will have a death spiral			0
' the @entity0 initially announced in september it was studying the possibility of closing the processing centres and published a notice in the @entity191 seeking comments			1
within 30 days , the plan elicited nearly 4,400 public comments , mostly in opposition			0
among them : @entity198 senator @entity197 , the top @entity199 on the @entity154 committee that oversees the post office , believes the agency is taking the wrong approach			2
she says service cuts will only push more consumers to online bill payment or private carriers such as @entity208 or @entity209 , leading to lower revenue in the future			0
' @entity212 and time again in the face of more red ink , the @entity0 puts forward ideas that could well accelerate its death spiral , ' she said , urging passage of a bill that would refund nearly $ 7billion the @entity0 overpaid into a federal retirement fund , encourage a restructuring of health benefits and reduce the agency 's annual payments into a retiree health account			1
that measure would postpone a move to five - day - a - week mail delivery for at least two years and require additional layers of review before the agency closed postal branches and mail processing centres			1
' the solution to the @entity0 's financial crisis is not easy but must involve tackling more significant expenses that do not drive customers , ' miss @entity197 said			0
in the event of a shutdown due to bankruptcy , private companies such as @entity209 and @entity208 could handle a small portion of the material the post office moves , but they do not go everywhere			2
no business has shown interest in delivering letters everywhere in the country for a set rate of 44 cents or 45 cents for a first - class letter .			1

post office set to close 250 of nearly 500 mail processing centres as early as march
@entity0 would also lower delivery standards in place since 1971
roughly 100,000 postal workers could lose their jobs , saving @entity0 around $ 6.5b
@entity260 says it must cut $ *20b* by 2015 to be profitable
small - town *mayors* and *legislators* in states *including* @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 cited the *economic* harm if postal offices were to close , eliminating jobs and reducing service . small - business owners in many other states also were worried .
@entity277 @entity276 and @entity278 , which prints some 27 trade and consumer publications , said delays to first - class delivery could ruin the value of their news . their magazines are typically printed at week 's end with mail arrival timed for weekend sports events or the monday start of the work week . newspapers , already struggling in the internet age , also could suffer .
@entity295 , which mails approximately *55million* customer billing *statements* each month , wants assurances that the @entity0 will widely publicize and educate the public about changes to avoid *confusion* over delivery that might lead to *delinquent* payments . the company is also concerned that after extensive cuts the @entity0 might realize it can not meet a *relaxed* standard of two - to - three day delivery .
@entity29 , which offers monthly pricing plans for *unlimited* dvds by mail , sent one disc or two at a time . longer delivery times would mean fewer opportunities to receive discs each month , effectively a price increase . @entity29 in recent months has been *vigorously* promoting its video *streaming* service as an alternative .
