@entity1 model @entity0 has lashed out at @entity3 administrators after the site removed a photo he posted of his family in the bath			1
@entity0 , whose career was launched in 2007 by @entity9 , shared an intimate family shot showing him with his partner @entity11 and their two daughters @entity14 and @entity15 , with the caption ' nothing like a family scrub '			1
facebook moderators removed the photo because the shot was deemed inappropriate by @entity3 's ' community standards regarding nudity ' , which @entity0 and many of his followers see as double standards			1
. to me this is happiness , but obviously @entity3 prefers chicks getting their cans out			2
' many of his followers were outraged by the move , and pointed to the constant stream of arguably inappropriate content that bombards them every day on the site with no intervention			2
' maybe @entity3 should worry about the r rated videos that is constantly in my newsfeed			2
this pic is gorgeous , how ridiculous ! ' , said one user			0

' they 've removed baby photos of me			0
yet @entity69 's photos are all over my newsfeed			0
it 's so ridiculous , ' said one user			0
another was more satirical , and said the photo was removed because ' you did n't balance a champagne glass on your bum			0
' @entity3 's nudity policy states that the site has a ' strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved , ' ' we also impose limitations on the display of nudity			1
we aspire to respect people â€™s right to share content of personal importance , whether those are photos of a sculpture like @entity105 or family photos of a child breastfeeding			0
' some on the site raised this point , calling the photo ' beautiful ' , ' gorgeous , ' ' lovely , ' and labelling it a ' great family photo			1
' @entity3 's nudity policy states that the site has a ' strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved ' @entity0 , the host of @entity31 , posted a screenshot of the removed content with the caption , ' are you serious @entity3 ? im guessing someone was offended by this			1
. to me this is happiness , but obviously @entity3 prefers chicks getting their cans out ' one specifically said , ' this is natural beauty as is breast feeding			2
do n't give up ! ' one user pointed out that she had been advised not to post pictures of the children she nannied as paedophiles targeted social media sites looking for nudity , and said that before it had been pointed out the thought had not even occurred to her			1
' it 's sad that that 's the world we live in			0
maybe @entity3 are attempting to protect your gorgeous girls in this instance ? ' she asked			0
before 2014 , photographs of mothers breastfeeding were banned from the site under their nudity policy , which was reversed after a feminist writer from @entity151 , @entity152 , and the @entity153 launched a campaign against what she saw as ' gender - based hate speech '			0
after receiving 60,000 tweets and 5,000 emails in support of the movement , @entity3 answered the call to refine it 's approach to the broader issue and included breastfeeding as allowable content , while still deeming other exposure of women 's nipple inappropriate			1
in a response from the site last year , @entity3 said that they continually ' work hard to make our platform a safe and respectful place for sharing and connection			2
this requires us to make difficult decisions and balance concerns about free expression and community respect			0
