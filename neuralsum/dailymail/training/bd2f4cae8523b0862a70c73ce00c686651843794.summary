when @entity2 was asked for his reaction , his answer was about as sorry as @entity4 looked on the pitch			1
' please excuse us for this mistake , ' the @entity4 manager said , admitting being beaten 7 - 1 in their own back yard was nothing short of a ' catastrophe '			1
@entity2 remained resilient by reminding the reeling footballing world that the hosts did their best after @entity4 conquered almost every department - apart from the one that mattered most			2
video : scroll down to watch the best virals after @entity4 's humiliating 7 - 1 defeat to @entity22 floored : @entity4 captain @entity23 scrambles for the ball but could not lead his side to @entity27 victory retrieve : @entity4 won the ball back more than their opponents but it was the goals that mattered most who 's at fault ? @entity4 lost 7 - 1 in their own back yard , breaking a few unwanted records along the way despair : @entity4 coach @entity2 looks helpless as he watches his side crumble against @entity22 crestfallen : @entity2 was gesturing to himself on the touchline as @entity4 conceded five first - half goals attacks : @entity4 win 55 to 34 @entity43 : @entity4 win 18 to 14 @entity44 : @entity4 win 13 to 12 @entity45 : @entity4 win 19 to 11 @entity46 : @entity4 win 22 to 10 @entity47 : @entity4 win 7 to 5 @entity48 : @entity4 win 7 to 3 lost balls : @entity4 win 69 to 76 tackles won : @entity4 win 5 to 1 @entity51 : @entity4 win 46 to 34 @entity52 : @entity4 win 20 to 4 possession : @entity4 win 52 % to 48 % but ... @entity54 : @entity22 win 592 to 547 @entity55 : @entity22 win 82 % to 79 % goals : @entity22 win 7 to 1 all statistics courtesy of @entity58			1
@entity4 were 5 - 0 down by half time and ended up being humiliated 7 - 1			1
but the statistics told a different story			0
despite their thrashing , @entity4 actually registered the most attacks , attempts and shots on target			2
they recovered the most lost balls , @entity68 made the most saves and they swung more crosses into the box than their opponents			0
most shots on target ? check			0
but it counted for little as @entity22 were clinical , changing the scoreline from 1 - 0 to 5 - 0 in six first - half minutes			2
the @entity4 team bus has the slogan ' @entity84 - se ! @entity86 hexa esta chegando ! ' ( ' brace yourselves ! the sixth is coming ! ' ) on the side , and while it referred to a sixth @entity27 triumph not a sixth @entity93 goal , the message appeared horribly prophetic			1
@entity2 said : ‘ it ’s probably the worst moment of my career			0
' this is the worst day of my life , but life goes on			2
‘ i ’ll be remembered probably because i lost 7 - 1 - the worst defeat @entity4 have ever had - but that was a risk i knew i was running when i accepted this position			1
that ’s what i ’ll do			0
‘ we did what we thought was our best , and we lost to a great team that had the team , in six or seven minutes , to end the game with three or four goals in extraordinary manner			0
opener : @entity114 scores @entity22 's first to set @entity116 's men on their way to a 7 - 1 victory the first of many : @entity23 can be excused for the first goal but his defending was woeful throughout easy : @entity22 had more passes with a better completion and scored seven to @entity4 's single consolation record breaker : @entity126 celebrates after becoming the top scorer in @entity27 history with 16 oops : @entity4 had more shots than their opponents but @entity22 were ruthless in front of goal lethal : @entity4 midfielder @entity134 watches on , as their defenders did all night , while @entity126 slots home partners : @entity4 , whose team bus has the slogan ' @entity144 yourselves ! the sixth is coming ! ' , were humiliated click here to read @entity148 's match report from @entity149 ‘ i can tell you that , after the first goal , we had a problem and , with the skills of a team who have been working together for a long time , they capitalised on it			1
‘ we will continue working and honouring what our team means for the third place match in @entity164			0
‘ i ’d like to thank the supporters for supporting the players despite us losing by five , six , seven			0
it was interesting to see that happen			0
’ @entity4 have one more game left of their @entity27 in the third and fourth play - off decider			2
opposites : @entity22 celebrate but @entity23 is unable to lift his teammates as the scoreline worsens no way back : @entity175 and @entity176 stand in the centre circle - something they did all too frequently on tuesday night hit for six : @entity22 's @entity179 forward @entity178 punches the air after making it 6 - 0 to the visitors only way is up : @entity22 progressed to the @entity27 final and were applauded by @entity4 's fans too little , too late : @entity175 scored a consolation for the host nation in the dying minutes but it was pointless			1

@entity27 hosts @entity4 *knocked* out in 7 - 1 defeat as @entity22 make final
@entity4 had most attacks , attempts , shots on target , crosses , saves , tackles and possession - but conceded five goals in *remarkable* 18 - minute spell
@entity126 became top scorer in @entity27 history with 16th goal
@entity2 *defiant* , saying he does *n't* ' owe anything to anyone '
@entity4 slogan on side of team bus : ' brace yourselves ! the sixth is coming ! '
@entity2 : ' this is the worst day of my life , but life goes on '
