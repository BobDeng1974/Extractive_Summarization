is it really you ? : jasper the cat stares lovingly at her best dog friend @entity19 before giving him the hug of a lifetime ( for a lifetime ) where have you been ? : jasper the cat has n't seen @entity7 in 10 days so she jumps up to give him a hug still hugging : @entity29 ca n't take her tiny paws off of @entity19 's neck because she misses him so much as soon as @entity29 catches a glimpse of @entity7 she ca n't help but wrap her tiny arms around his neck			1
' meow , ' @entity29 exclaims several times as if to say , ' i missed you so much			0
how could you ever leave me ? ' when her tiny claws fail her and she falls off her furry friend 's neck , she resiliently goes up to give him another very long hug			0
@entity45 who is less emotive than his feline companion wags his tail silently and walks into the next room			0
not letting him out of her sight , @entity29 follows @entity7 as he walks away and continues to jump on him for more hugs			2
no hug back ? : @entity55 continues to hug @entity7 as he wags his tail silently , perhaps too overcome with emotion to let out a single woof do n't leave again ! : as @entity45 walks into the next room , @entity29 keeps a tight grip on him as she does n't let him out of her sight			2
