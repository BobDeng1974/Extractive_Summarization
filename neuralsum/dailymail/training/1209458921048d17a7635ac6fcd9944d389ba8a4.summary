by @entity0 published : 08:08 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 14 november 2013 the euro zone economy all but stagnated in the third quarter of the year with @entity4 's recovery fizzling out and growth in @entity6 slowing			1
the 9.5 trillion euro economy pulled out of its longest recession in the previous quarter but record unemployment , lack of consumer confidence and anaemic bank lending continue to prevent a more solid rebound			1
in the three months to september , the combined economy of the 17 countries sharing the euro grew by a slower than expected 0.1 per cent			1
in the previous quarter it rose 0.3 per cent – the first expansion in 18 months			1
worry : @entity4 is becoming a focus for concern within the currency bloc the euro fell to a session low in response			2
the @entity4 economy contracted by 0.1 per cent , snuffing out signs of revival in the previous three months			1
it had been expected to post quarterly growth of 0.1 per cent and has now shrunk in three of the last four quarters			2
@entity6 growth slowed to 0.3 per cent , from a robust 0.7 in the second quarter , but @entity34 's largest economy clearly remains in much better shape			1
there were positive signs in the southern periphery with @entity39 growing 0.2 percent on the quarter after a 1.1 percent rise in the previous three months and @entity41 returning to a tepid growth of 0.1 percent - its first positive number quarter - on - quarter since the first quarter of 2011			1
@entity4 is becoming a focus for concern within the currency bloc			0
the @entity47 predicts the economy will expand by 0.4 per cent in the last quarter of the year but the government 's labour and pension reforms are widely viewed as too timid			1
a report on @entity4 competitiveness by the @entity55 - based @entity54 warned that it is falling behind southern @entity34 countries that have cut labour costs and become leaner and meaner			0
‘ to reduce the economic lag and lost time , @entity4 needs to keep up structural reforms , ’ @entity54 chief @entity58 said			0
the report will be hard for the government to ignore since it was commissioned by president @entity63			0
study : @entity63 commissioned a report by the @entity54 on @entity4 competitiveness , which found that @entity4 is lagging behind some @entity34 countries @entity6 growth was fuelled by domestic demand			0
exports faltered , another indication of the malaise gripping the rest of the euro zone			2
‘ @entity77 interest rates are far too low for @entity6			0
@entity6 will probably grow significantly more strongly than the euro zone , ’ said @entity74 , chief economist at @entity75			0
‘ early indicators point to similar growth in the fourth quarter			0
’ the @entity81 forecasts the currency area will shrink by 0.4 per cent over 2013 as a whole before growing by a modest 1.1 per cent in 2014			0
however , with unemployment in the bloc running above 12 per cent and one in two young people out of work in @entity89 and @entity41 , talk of recovery rings hollow			2
compounding the @entity4 gloom , private sector payroll data showed some 17,000 jobs were destroyed in the third quarter , while inflation slowed in october to 0.7 per cent , the weakest level in four years , when @entity4 was emerging from a deep recession .			2

in the previous quarter the 17 euro economies grew by 0.3 per cent
@entity41 's economy grew by 0.1 per cent , but one in two are still unemployed
