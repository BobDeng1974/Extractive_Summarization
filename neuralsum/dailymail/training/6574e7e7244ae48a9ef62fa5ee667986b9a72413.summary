by @entity1 reporter published : 17:36 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 21:46 est , 18 march 2014 an @entity4 woman who became pregnant just six months after she underwent a tubal ligation in 2008 and gave birth to a baby girl with sickle cell disease is now suing her doctor for ' wrongful pregnancy			1
' while a small percentage of women become pregnant after getting their tubes tied , @entity12 ' situation was all the more shocking because she had just a single ovary and she believes the doctor may have cauterized the wrong falopian tube			1
@entity12 was further dismayed after she experienced congestive heart failure following the pregnancy she did n't believe could happen and now the 44 - year - old mother wants money for the ' extraordinary ' medical expenses she says she 'll incur as she raises @entity25 , who is now 4			1
' i love @entity25 with all my heart ... but it ¿ s been a life change for everybody ' : @entity12 ( right ) is suing the doctor she says fouled up her tubal ligation , leading to her pregnancy with @entity25 ( left ) , who is now 4 and living with sickle cell disease @entity12 is suing dr. @entity36 , @entity37 for ' wrongful pregnancy ' and wants damages and money for her daughter 's many medical expenses ' i was livid , ' @entity12 recelled to @entity42 about the moment her pregnancy test came back positive			1
' i just lost it			0
' @entity12 had several reasons to be dismayed			2
she and her husband had decided to stop having babies after three because they both carry the genetic trait for sickle cell and had already had one child with the full blown disease			1
' i just wanted to get my tubes tied , ' @entity12 said			1
and she did just that with dr. @entity53 of @entity54 in @entity55			0
except she only technically needed one tube tied			2
@entity12 had her right ovary removed at the age of 12 due to a cyst			2
despite that , in 2010 @entity12 gave birth to her daughter @entity25			1
@entity25 had sickle cell disease , but @entity12 was unable to take care of her because he suffered congestive heart failure after the little girl 's birth by c - section			1
tubal ligation is a permanent procedure used to prevent pregnancy			0
the fallopian tubes are cauterized , cut and / or tie to prevent the sperm and the egg from meeting			0
while rare , pregnancy can occur after the procedure			0
failure occurs in between 2 - 10 out of every 1,000 tubal ligations ' this is right after i have a baby that i still ca n’t believe i had , ' she told @entity42			0
' i could n’t be with my baby because i was too sick			0
' @entity12 spent two weeks in intensive care and missed work for a total of nine months			2
she filed suit against dr. @entity53 in 2010			0
last month an appellate court ruled that the state could go forward despite a move to dismiss by @entity36 's attorney 's			0
' having a baby after a sterilization procedure is something that happens , ' said @entity12 ’ attorney , @entity95			2
but then @entity95 learned that @entity12 ' only had one ovary and started to see the case differently			2
' when i found out more about the whole story , i said , " ok , let ’s move forward			0
let ’s see where this goes			0
" ' according to medical records obtained by @entity42 , @entity36 ' tied , ' ' excised ' and ' cauterized ' @entity12 ' right falopian tube			1
however , her right ovary had been removed			0
' she is the absolute love of my life , but it ¿ s hard ' : @entity12 and her husband both have the sickle cell genetic train , not the disease			1
which means each of their children was born with a 25 percent chance of having sickle cell disease			1
after one of their other children ( now ages 25 , 21 and 17 ) was born with the painful illness , they decided to stop having children ... then little @entity25 came along the records reportedly indicate that her left tube was intact and ' normal in appearance			1
' @entity36 's attorney @entity128 told @entity42 that his client ' complied with the standard of care ' in performing @entity12 ' tubal ligation			2
but his former patient disagrees and now wants damages for ' personal injury to her , emotional distress , and for lost wages ' and medical costs from @entity36			0
' it ’s not fair , ' @entity12 said			2
' she is the absolute love of my life , but it ’s hard			0
sometimes people think i ’m her grandmother			0
' a normal red blood cell ( right ) and a sickle cell ( left ) @entity146 sickle cell disease demands immediate treatment for babies			1
about 80,000 @entity150 have sickle cell disease , in which oxygen - carrying hemoglobin clumps inside red blood cells , turning them into a sickle shape that ca n't squeeze through tiny blood vessels			1
that causes pain , infections and eventually life - threatening organ damage			0
@entity160 sickle cell trait is different			1
more than 2.5 million @entity150 have it , meaning they carry one copy of the abnormal hemoglobin gene , not the two needed to cause full disease			2
babies from couples who both have the trait , like @entity12 and @entity169 , have a 25 percent chance of having sickle cell disease			1
trait carriers only occasionally experience health problems , like blood in the urine , some blood clumping at high altitudes and in athletes — in which intense exercise can cause blood cells to sickle enough to block blood flow to muscles , which rapidly break down			0
sickle cell is most common in black @entity150 — about 10 % have the trait — and also in people of @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 and @entity190 ancestry			1
read the @entity192 's decision to let @entity194 ' case proceed			0

@entity12 , 44 , opted for sterilization *surgery* in 2008 in part because she and her husband both carry the sickle cell trait
they already had one son with sickle cell disease
@entity12 ' pregnancy is even more *unbelievable* because she only has one ovary after losing the other as a child
records indicate the doctor may have tied the wrong fallopian tube
@entity12 suffered congestive heart failure following the birth of of daughter @entity25 , who is now 4
