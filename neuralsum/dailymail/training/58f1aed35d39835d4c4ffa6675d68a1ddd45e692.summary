it is the season of glad tidings and forgiveness			2
but many @entity3 living in @entity4 , @entity5 , are struggling to find goodwill in their hearts for the latest in a series of controversial billboards coming out from the @entity10			1
time for @entity13 to come out ' , the sign proclaims , with an image of baby jesus as a toddler in a manger , surrounded by a rainbow halo			1
the billboard was put up by the @entity21 , who said it was meant to ' lift ' the humanity of @entity13			1
but it is likely to face the same fate as last year 's controversial poster - torn down by angry locals			1
controversial : @entity28 in the @entity30 's billboard questions if @entity13 was gay - while a more traditional poster announces the @entity12 services @entity34 eyebrows : the poster is getting attention - and criticism - from those who see it the @entity41 's message , while presented in a controversial manner , is to ask if it would change anything for the faithful if @entity13 had been gay			1
he points out that there is no indication about @entity13 's sexuality : ' the fact is we do n't know what his sexual orientation was			1
' this is n't the first time the church has erected a controversial billboard			1
last year the church erected one showing the @entity57 looking shocked at the results of a pregnancy test			2
however it did not last long , after an angry protestor tore it down			2
but @entity21 did not mind , especially as the image had already gone viral , seen by millions of people			2
he said : ' in the internet age though the image will be out there forever			2
they can do what they want to it			2
' on this year 's billboard , @entity71 said that , as homosexuality was not a word until the 1800s , any mention of it in the @entity77 or other documents would have mistranslations			1
fellow reverend @entity81 said the billboard tries to humanise @entity13 by getting people to think about the challenges he would have had growing up			1
he added : ' some scholars have tried to make the case that he might have been gay			0
' but it is all conjecture			0
maybe gay , maybe not			0
does it matter ? ' there is almost nothing in the record of his teachings about sexuality while there is plenty about the perils of being rich			0
certainly he always supported the marginalised in society			0
' flashback : last year 's poster - of @entity57 with a pregnancy test - was destroyed by an angry neighbour criticism : the protestor ended up ripping the poster down in anger it is not the first time billboards have caused an outrage			0
in the @entity115 , the gay lobby group @entity114 's bus poster campaign stating ' some people are gay			0
get over it ' has raised debates over how far advertising should push a viewpoint			0
it has led to some controversy , including one @entity3 bus driver from @entity125 who left a bus - full of angry passengers waiting as he would not drive a bus with the banner on the side			0
earlier this year , @entity133 mayor @entity132 blocked a @entity3 group from running a ' not gay and proud : get over it ' campaign on @entity133 buses			0
the sign , like the one pictured here , was a billboard for gay lobby group @entity114			1
passengers spent 20 minutes stranded on the bus because the driver refused to board			0
