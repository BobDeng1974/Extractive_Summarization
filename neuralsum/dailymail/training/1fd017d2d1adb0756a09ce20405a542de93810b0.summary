by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 18:44 est , 26 may 2013 former @entity2 presenter @entity1 faced a storm of protest yesterday after he appeared to suggest women could ‘ aggravate ’ their risk of being raped			1
the broadcaster likened women who dressed and behaved provocatively to banks storing cash by the front door , or motorists leaving laptops on the back seat of their cars			0
he insisted he was not blaming victims – saying ‘ no amount of temptation can excuse rape ’ – but questioned whether some women chose not to pursue complaints because they felt partly responsible			1
@entity1 wrote in his new book that ' not all rape is rape ' and said that some situations are more complicated in an extract from his new book , published in the @entity25 , he said : ‘ rape victims were once treated appallingly , as though it was all their fault , but have we now gone too far the other way ? ‘ many of the victims seem to think we have			1
the main argument of my book is this : we can aggravate crime by tempting fate , and we curb it by playing safe			0
‘ we have come to acknowledge it is foolish to leave laptops on the back seat of a car			0
we would laugh at a bank that stored sacks of cash by the front door			0
we would be aghast if an airport badly skimped on its security measures			0
‘ our forebears might be astonished at how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been regarded as incitement			0
‘ not even in the licentious days of @entity50 in the 17th @entity51 was it acceptable for women to dress as provocatively as they have done in @entity54 culture since the 1960s			0
equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted , stay out late , often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss , grope or go to bed with one - night stands			0
’ @entity1 cited ' booze culture ' as one of the reasons that the situation is more complicated			1
he added that our forebears would have been shocked with how women behave these days mr @entity1 , 65 , who presented @entity2 from 1984 to 2007 , provoked outrage among campaigners against rape and on social networking sites			1
he said the @entity25 had misquoted him in its headline , which said ‘ not all women are victims and not all rape is rape ’ , but said the edited extract was fair			1
campaigners described his remarks as ‘ outdated and ridiculous ’ and former conservative mp @entity70 described the extract as ‘ pretty damning ’			2
another former @entity2 presenter , @entity72 , said on @entity73 : ‘ struggling to match the man i know with the comments ! ! ! ! what on earth is going on ? ’ but mr @entity1 also received several messages of support , including one from a woman who described herself as ‘ a multiple victim ’			1
in his book @entity83 , serialised in the @entity25 , mr @entity1 described how former justice secretary @entity84 faced outcry in 2011 when he used the phrase ‘ serious rape ’			1
mr @entity1 wrote : ‘ it has become sacrilege to suggest that there can be any gradation : rape is rape			1
@entity1 is famous for presenting @entity2 with the late presenter @entity91 ‘ the real experts , the victims , know otherwise			2
half of all women who had had penetrative sex unwillingly do not think they were raped , and this proportion rises strongly when the assault involves a boyfriend , or if the woman is drunk or high on drugs : they led him on , they went too far , it was n’t forcible , they did n’t make themselves clear ... for them , rape is n’t always rape and , however upsetting , they feel it is a long way removed from being systematically violated or snatched off the street			2
’ mr @entity1 said the book was ‘ serious , carefully researched and evidence - based ’ and an attempt to have a reasoned debate about a sensitive subject			1
he told the @entity109 : ‘ of course i do not compare a woman to a laptop			2
that is nothing short of misrepresentation of my message			0
‘ what i am saying is that opportunity and temptation are key factors in all crimes , and so far as the evidence goes sex crimes are no exception			2
‘ far from blaming people my book says we are too quick to blame , and that it tends to distract us from finding solutions to crime			0

@entity1 forced to defend himself after a *backlash* against his new book
insisted the book was ' serious , carefully researched and evidence - based '
@entity1 has provoked outrage by suggesting ‘ rape is n’t always rape ’
he said that it is more complicated if the woman is with her boyfriend
