by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 01:37 est , 11 september 2012 being critical is @entity2 ’s job			1
but now the veteran film reviewer is facing some critics of his own			1
readers have taken him to task over his weekly film review column in the @entity8 , saying it is sexist , misogynistic and stuck in the past			1
they pointed to his recent review of 1990 movie @entity12 in which he described @entity14 ’s character as an ‘ archetypal tart with a heart ’ and ‘ every man ’s dream hooker ’			1
and why not ? @entity2 , pictured here presenting one of his famous film review programmes , insisted he was merely describing how the movie depicted women but @entity2 , 79 , insisted he was merely describing how the movie depicted women rather than expressing his own views			1
‘ @entity26 , what is the matter with these people ? ’ he said			1
in the @entity12 review he wrote : ‘ nowadays this arouses the tut - tut of disapproval for its sexism and rose - tinted view of prostitution ( as personified by every man ’s dream hooker , @entity14 )			1
‘ @entity36 ( every girl ’s dream billionaire ) is the businessman who picks her up in @entity38 and hires her for a week , partly for sex but mostly as arm candy to be worn at dinners and polo matches ... ‘ @entity14 , of course , has been driven to the streets by harsh circumstances and is really the archetypal tart with a heart while @entity36 is not nearly so ruthless as he first appears			1
charm : @entity14 in @entity12 ‘ suspend disapproval and enjoy because it ’s made and played with a great deal of charm			1
’ in another review @entity2 appeared to suggest women liked @entity53 because of the spy ’s ruthless approach to love			1
he wrote : ‘ for a young man , what was not to like ? we all wanted to be @entity53			2
and somehow , despite – or who knows , possibly because of – his cavalier and occasionally cruel treatment of their sex , women seemed to like him , too			2
’ in another review he described @entity68 ’s 1953 classic movie @entity69 , saying : ‘ it ’s all very sexist ( women ’s @entity71 had n’t been invented then ) but it ’s amusing enough			1
’ in another , he referred to @entity75 ’s character in the 1983 movie educating @entity77 as a ‘ tarty working - class student ’			2
reader @entity79 , from @entity80 , complained that @entity2 had made ‘ four sexist remarks in just a few lines ’ , adding : ‘ i ’m tired of reading the misogynist ( sic ) comments @entity2 injects into so many film reviews			1
’ outspoken headmistress dr @entity85 , from @entity87 ’s @entity86 in @entity88 , said @entity2 should take more care not to repeat negative stereotypes of women			2
miss @entity85 , whose targets have included @entity94 judge @entity93 for a foul - mouthed rant on @entity96 , said the world had moved on and @entity2 should too			2
‘ while he is writing about films from a more sexist era , he should be careful not to suggest they are reminiscent of a glorious golden age , ’ she said			2
‘ by repeating sexist phrases , you help reinforce sexist views			0
‘ mr @entity2 is a witty and acerbic writer			0
someone with that power of language needs to be careful not to reinforce outmoded ways of thinking			0
the world has moved on from the days when it is ok to describe a woman as a “ tart with a heart ” , and he needs to move on too			0
’ however , mr @entity2 was scathing in his defence			0
‘ @entity26 , what is the matter with these people ? , ’ he said			0
‘ i was merely describing in shorthand how these films depict women , not advancing my own views			0
if people do n’t have the intelligence to see that , it is not my fault			0
i ’m not old fashioned			0
‘ these are phrases that have been used for years , and are still used now			0
i think political correctness can be very important , but it does go overboard sometimes			0
it is possible to be too prickly , possibly a little humourless about things			0
