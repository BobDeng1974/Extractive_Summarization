since the most recent outbreak in march of this year , the ebola virus has killed more than 1427 people in @entity27 , according to the @entity28			1

@entity43 , an @entity3 psychologist providing counselling to people with @entity37 , their families and medical workers , said his most ' heartbreaking ' role is separating children from mothers who could be carrying @entity37 ‘ it ’s always a heartbreaking moment to actually tell the parent that it ’s in the best interest of the child to separate from the mother and in two cases they were actually breastfeeding , so it is very difficult to persuade them to give up their children , and then the problem arises who is going to look after the child in a safe environment , ' dr @entity43 said			2
' people are scared , and anybody who has been here faces a huge problem with stigma and marginalisation when they go home			0
' giving really correct timely information to the community , is really important , i guess given the kind of suddenness of the epidemic , and the catastrophic impact it ’s had on small communities where whole families have been wiped out			0
' dr @entity106 , a @entity107 physician who was sent to the coordination centre to assess the effectiveness of the strategy , explained how local customs and emergency workers were colliding in their response to the outbreak			2
