when you settle down to the cheese board this @entity2 , try not to feel too guilty			0
it turns out some of the wedges we ’ll be spreading over the crackers could actually be good for us			0
scientists have found the blue cheese roquefort – known for its mould and blue - green veins – has anti-inflammatory properties which could help guard against cardiovascular disease			1
miracle food ? : a report that @entity17 cheese could have massive health benefits have been disputed by a top nutritionist the cheese , which is aged in caves in the @entity21 , could be among the reasons why the @entity23 enjoy good health despite a diet high in saturated fat – a situation dubbed the @entity28			1
a process that occurs as the cheese ripens is good for a healthy gut , helps slow arthritis , and can slow the signs of ageing , such as cellulite , according to @entity37 - based biotech company @entity36			2
researchers found that the properties of the blue cheese worked best in acidic environments , such as the lining of the stomach			1
the research , entitled ‘ could cheese be the missing piece in the @entity23 paradox puzzle ? ’ , was led by dr @entity48 and dr @entity49			2
@entity50 is a leading nutritionist and disputed @entity36 's claims about @entity17 it suggested regular consumption by the @entity23 of @entity17 , @entity54 and other moulded fermented cheeses could be one of the reasons the nation has the lowest rate of cardiovascular mortality in the developed world			1
the experts said @entity17 ’s properties could be extracted and used in pharmaceutical and anti-ageing products			0
the report stated : ‘ observations indicate that consumption of red wine alone can not explain the paradox and perhaps some other constituents of the typical @entity23 diet could be responsible for reduced cardiovascular mortality			0
‘ we hypothesise that cheese consumption , especially of moulded varieties , may contribute to the occurrence of the “ @entity23 paradox ”			2
’ leading nutritionist @entity50 , however , was sceptical about the findings			1
‘ we should not automatically think of inflammation as a bad thing , ’ she said			0
‘ inflammation is the sign that the body is healing something ( we sprain our ankle , it inflames – that is the body sending fluids , blood and lipoproteins to the area to repair the damage ) .			0

but claims the mouldy blue cheese is a miracle health food are rotten , says leading nutritionist
