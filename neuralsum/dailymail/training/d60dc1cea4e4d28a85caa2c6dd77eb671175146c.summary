@entity1 boss @entity0 has suggested there 's more to come from @entity1 after a bright showing that saw his side win 2 - 0 in @entity6			1
in what was billed as the @entity1 ' toughest @entity10 qualifier , @entity0 's team recorded a morale boosting victory at @entity13 in @entity14 thanks to two @entity16 goals			1
the @entity1 manager was pleased with his side 's overall display but admitted there were areas for improvements and that his young squad needed to work on cutting naivety out of their game			1
job done : @entity1 boss @entity0 celebrates during his side 's 2 - 0 win in @entity6 i 've never really lost faith			1
i 'm just pleased to see the boys play well , @entity0 told @entity33 after the game			2
' i thought that the way we approached the game from the first minute was exactly what we wanted and we got our reward for once			0
' i think we made hard work of it because there were so many chances to score goals before we eventually got the one that we needed but it was a good performance away from home against one of the better teams in the group and i 'm pleased we won			2
' i thought they played some good football in the second half			0
i thought in the first half we were largely in control but they got better as the game went on but luckily we did n't deteriorate too much			0
' i think there are areas there that we 've got to improve			2
but you ca n't expect players playing their early games , or even making their debuts , to make all the right decisions and not show some naivety from time to time because of the pressures of the game			0
they are areas we can work ( on ) and we 've got a couple of years to do so			0
' hotshot : @entity16 scored twice for the @entity1 in the @entity10 qualifier @entity1 created a fair amount of chances to make the margin of victory more comfortable , but also had to survive a few scares with @entity79 making a number of superb stops while @entity82 made a crucial goal line clearance in the second half with the score at 1 - 0			1
but following a poor @entity88 and an uninspiring 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity90 on wednesday , the @entity87 triumph will lift the pressure on the national side			1
former @entity1 manager @entity93 shared @entity0 's sentiments that the squad still had areas to improve , but admitted that the talent exists in the squad to develop into a fine international side that will find its strength on the counter attack			1
talking point : former @entity1 boss @entity93 ( right ) was an @entity33 pundit for the game in @entity14 alongside former @entity1 internationals @entity105 ( left ) and @entity106 ' there 's quite a lot of players that are not international footballers yet , but in two years â€™ time they can embrace this , ' @entity93 told @entity33 post match			1
' they will make mistakes but we 've got youth and talent that 's not even in the team at the moment			0
' you 've got to draw the line and move on from the @entity88 , we are going to qualify and i think we can progress as a team going forward			0
' we deserved it and defended reasonably well			0
this team needs to be 1 - 0 up , it 's made for counter attacking football - we 've got pace with this team			2
we saw a much more confident team			0

@entity0 pleased with @entity1 side following 2 - 0 win in @entity6
three @entity1 boss *concedes* that young squad is still naive but will improve
two @entity16 goals *sealed* victory at @entity13 , @entity14
