former @entity1 - winning captain @entity0 looks likely to be the best - known casualty of a remarkable ageism purge taking place at the @entity5			1
@entity6 , highly - respected managing director of cricket partnerships , is expected to be offered a low - key ambassador role after radical changes are recommended at a board meeting today			2
@entity6 ’s demise follows the recent departure of chief executive @entity14 , commercial director @entity15 and hr director @entity16 — all of whom are in their late 50s or 60			1
@entity0 is highly - respected in his @entity5 role but will be asked to take a lower level job to make way for a younger generation of administrators and other members of @entity5 staff in that age bracket feel similarly threatened by the more youthful revolution being carried out by @entity29 ’s @entity28 in advance of him becoming chairman of @entity5 and @entity32 arriving at @entity33 as the new chief executive			1
@entity0 said : ‘ changes are being made , but i do n’t know what they ’ll be			0
i ’m waiting to find out			0
’ @entity14 ’s surprise departure last summer is understood to be connected with him finding it very difficult to work with @entity28 , who wants to build a new much more county - focused @entity5 regime around the new ceo , commercial chief @entity44 and ultra-political chief operating officer @entity45 , who has carried out the major staff review			1
supermarket chain tycoon @entity28 , whose ascendancy will mean current chairman @entity49 concentrates on @entity51 business in a likely new role as @entity5 president , has the strong support of two powerful county chairmen in @entity57 ’s @entity56 and @entity59 ’s @entity58			2
ironically , the executives leaving the @entity5 are younger than first - class umpires @entity61 and @entity63 who are taking their aegism case to an employment tribunal after being retired against their wishes at the age of 65			2
the @entity69 were absent from @entity70 in @entity71 despite the fact the @entity5 manager is usually interviewed			1
and even after the @entity78 debacle , a chat with a croaking @entity75 could still have been relatively upbeat after @entity5 ’s 100 per cent start to their @entity81 campaign			1
however , @entity82 and all the @entity84 top brass were ‘ unavailable ’			1
@entity82 was unavailable to go to @entity70 , where there was no @entity69 representation @entity5 's dismal @entity78 showing meant that the national football team were not on the @entity70 agenda but @entity69 chief executive @entity90 , linked with succeeding departing @entity69 chief @entity91 , did attend as well as @entity93 boss @entity92			1
@entity96 golf ’s high command from the @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 had travelled to @entity100 in anticipation of double - major winner @entity102 being named @entity70			2
@entity102 ( right ) was expected to win , but ended up finishing behind @entity104 driver @entity103 but they were remarkably sanguine after @entity103 ’s victory that exposes the total inadequacy of a public vote shoehorned into 35 minutes on the night when @entity104 ’s social media dominance over golf became so apparent			0
world champion @entity103 , @entity96 ’s richest sportsman as well as @entity70 , is understood to have granted @entity114 ’s @entity113 entertainment agency @entity112 a trial period to represent him to see what they can do for his benefit			0
@entity112 , who bought @entity120 earlier this year for $ 2.4billion , used to look after @entity103 ’s girlfriend @entity121			0
@entity103 's success was an indication of the dominance of @entity104 's of social media presence over golf 's @entity129 ’s @entity128 plans begin @entity130 , who is standing as the @entity5 candidate for the @entity96 vice-presidency on the @entity133 , is starting to distance himself from the @entity134 and the possible conflicts that would bring in @entity136			1
he is to step down from the @entity134 ’s audit and remuneration committee			0
meanwhile , the @entity134 will have to change their statutes to accommodate ceo @entity141 becoming executive chairman , which is currently the favourite option			0
article 42 states the chairman must be independent and @entity69 approved , which wo n’t help @entity141 ’s cause			0
@entity147 are promoting themselves as the first @entity134 club to be accredited for paying all staff , and sub-contractors , the minimum £ 9.15 - an - hour @entity151 living wage			1
@entity147 may be comfortable with life on the pitch at the moment , but they have upset some security personell this coincides with them outsourcing their security operation to specialists @entity160 security			0
it has upset some long - term @entity147 security personnel who have lost their club connection while three chiefs , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 , remain on the club payroll			2
@entity147 say the move is for best security and the three bosses have a wider remit .			0

@entity6 follows @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 in ageist purge
older @entity5 staff feel under threat of youthful revolution
@entity82 ' unavailable ' for @entity70 after dismal @entity78
@entity147 become first @entity134 club to pay living wage
