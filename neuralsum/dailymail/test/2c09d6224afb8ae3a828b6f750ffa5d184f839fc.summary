a typical night out would involve several pints and bottles of @entity47 , a packet of cigarettes and then a greasy takeaway			2
by the time she reached 17 , miss @entity7 was a size 20			1

' the reality of her weight gain only hit her when she attended her medical centre , in the hope of quitting smoking , and she could n't climb the stairs without getting breathless			2
medical experts warned her blood pressure was dangerously high at 145/90 , a major risk factor for heart disease or a stroke			1
miss @entity7 , who lives with her boyfriend @entity70 , a 29 - year - old baker , said : ' it was horrible hearing from a nurse that i had put on so much weight and combined with my addiction to cigarettes , that my life was in danger			1

before breakfast : huge bowl of @entity113 and white toast with lashings of jam and butter lunch : pre-made sandwiches from convenience stores dinner : ready meal and chips or greasy takeaway from chinese or fish and chip shop snacks : crisps , chocolate drinks : full - fat fizzy drinks , blue @entity47 after breakfast : porridge and fresh fruit lunch : ham salad or omelette dinner : home - cooked meal made from scratch using healthy ingredients , with one third of the plate vegetables snacks : fruit drinks : water ' i was terrified that i could have died			0
i was completely scared to death when she sent me home with a heart monitor			0
' i did n't realise i had let myself get this big but the shock was enough , it gave me the opportunity to change my life			0
' determined to lose weight , she decided to join @entity156 for support			2

she added : ' people say it 's expensive to buy healthy food but i was spending between £ 30 and £ 40 a week bingeing on takeaways			0
' now i always stick to my budget and i feel a lot better for it			0
' miss @entity7 ' hard work paid off and she managed to drop six dress sizes , her blood pressure is back to normal and she has n't touched a cigarette since			1
she makes sure she drinks moderately on nights out and avoids sugary drinks like blue @entity47 , instead opting for clear spirits with a low - calorie mixer			0
she can now wear flattering size 10 - 12 tops and dresses and can even fit into a pair of trousers she used to wear when she was younger			0
since losing the weight , she has begun working as a consultant for @entity156 , wanting to help others in a similar situation			0
