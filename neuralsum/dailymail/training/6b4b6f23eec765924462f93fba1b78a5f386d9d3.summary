@entity1 legend and @entity3 columnist @entity0 has launched a scathing attack on @entity6 defender and @entity8 - winner @entity7			1
the @entity10 centre half looked short on form and confidence as the @entity13 lost 3 - 2 to @entity14 at the @entity15 , and @entity0 believes @entity7 let his team - mates , and in particular his fellow defenders , down			1
' what confidence does that ( type of performance ) give the young lads around him , ' @entity0 said on @entity23 1 's @entity22			2
@entity0 described @entity7 's performance against @entity14 as ' unacceptable ' @entity25 scored within the first 25 seconds against @entity6 and @entity7 was partly at fault ' he 's got to help these ( younger defenders ) and protect them and stop them getting asked questions			1
' you 're in a game away at @entity14 in a tough venue - let your players around you know you 're not going to accept what 's going on			2
' this is your captain on the day			0
we talk about leadership , character - like ( @entity37 ) @entity36 always talks about after the game			0
' he 's abandoned ship , he 's left them on their own and that is not acceptable for a player of that quality and experience			0
it 's just not acceptable			0
' @entity6 struggled to deal with @entity50 ( right ) for large periods - @entity52 was sent off for this challenge young full back @entity54 also looked as though he could have used more guidance from @entity7			1
