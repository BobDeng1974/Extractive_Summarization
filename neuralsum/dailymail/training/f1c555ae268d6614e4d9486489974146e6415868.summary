@entity0 admits his short - term future in rugby union lies in the centre - even if @entity5 coach @entity4 sees him as a ' barnstorming back rower '			1
league convert @entity0 made a 17 - minute cameo from the bench as @entity5 went top of the @entity11 with a 25 - 6 victory over @entity13 at the @entity14 on friday night			1
@entity0 ' arrival in the centre would have delighted @entity18 coach @entity17 who believes the 25 - year - old can make a real impact in that position at next year 's @entity22 , and the @entity24 - born powerhouse admits that is where his formative education in union will take place			1
@entity0 charges into the @entity13 defence with his first touch of the ball in rugby union ' i 've been mixing it up in training but i think i 'll stay at centre for now , certainly over the next few games , ' @entity0 said after tasting his first action since his final game for the @entity40 on october 5 when he played almost the entire @entity41 with a fractured cheekbone			1
' but we 've got a lot of time			2
it 's certainly not an overnight transition and the worst thing we could do is rush it			0
' it was always going to be hard but i 've really enjoyed it and everyone 's been open to teaching me things			0
' the game 's tough to learn and i was sat on the bench a little bit nervous			0
there was plenty of excitement at the @entity59 as rugby league superstar @entity0 was named on the bench ' i have n't felt that for a while but i enjoyed the feeling and the adrenalin and once you get on the field you just enjoy the game			2
' @entity0 admits he has thought about next year 's @entity22 in @entity18 but insists he has much to grasp about union before breaking into the national team set - up			1
' i think everyone 's got an eye on the @entity22 , ' @entity0 said			2
' i 'm not going to be naive and dismiss it , but it would be stupid to waste energy looking at that			0
' i 'm using all my energy to focusing on training here with the guys , knuckling down and working hard with my team - mates at @entity5			1
a tearful @entity0 celebrates winning the @entity41 with the @entity40 last month ' it 's great to be part of that			2
we train intensely and it 's been great to slot into that environment , but i will learn most through time on the field with the guys			0
' @entity4 said he was delighted with @entity0 ' introduction to union a month ahead of schedule , something which @entity17 described as ' a bonus ' with the @entity22 in mind			1
but he suggested that playing @entity0 at inside - centre could be short - lived with a place in the @entity5 back row very much an option			1
' the two carries he had were very , very good , ' @entity4 said			0
' he needs to get out there and play and when the pressure 's on that will accelerate his learning			0
@entity0 chats to @entity5 head coach @entity4 at the @entity14 last month ' there 's a plan there and @entity0 's first few games are going to come at 12 , but when it 's dry we 're going to have a look at him in the back row as well			1
' personally , i think that will suit @entity0 personally more			2
it 's a gut feeling of mine as he 's a guy who carries and tackles a lot and i do n't want to stick him out in the centre to do nothing			0
' that 's not his skill set			0
can we get him over the gain line with six , seven or eight on his back ? ' of course we can and the next month or so we 'll know where he is			0
' my vision is for @entity0 to be a barnstorming back row and we 'll see how it unfolds , it 'll be a good journey			1
