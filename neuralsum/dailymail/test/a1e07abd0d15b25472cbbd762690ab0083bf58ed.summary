@entity0 believes he deserves to be higher up the @entity2 pecking order and has pledged to prove his worth to manager @entity3			1
the 25 - year - old has been one of the standout performers for @entity6 , where the left - back moved permanently earlier in the year having impressed on loan from @entity9			2
@entity0 has attracted plenty of plaudits for his displays at @entity13 's , yet struggled to gain the international recognition many of his colleagues have received			2
@entity0 was the fifth left back to be called in to @entity3 's @entity2 squad last month a call - up had been predicted for @entity2 's internationals against @entity19 and @entity20 last month , yet @entity3 plumped for @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity24 was then preferred when @entity23 pulled out , only for @entity0 to get the nod once the @entity27 full - back and then @entity21 dropped out			1
it meant the @entity6 left - back travelled to @entity20 and eventually played the final few minutes of the 1 - 1 draw in @entity31 , with his third @entity2 cap a peculiar end to the international break			1
' it was different , ' he said , smiling			0
' the international break changed from one extreme to the next , but it was good to get back in the frame and get back in the door			2
' it was good to get on the pitch , even though it was very brief			0
' when you actually sit there , it hits you that all them years you spent as a kid watching football games , the @entity2 games were always the biggest			2
@entity0 slides in to challenge @entity50 midfielder @entity49 earlier this month ' to finally sit there and be part of it and wear the actual kit and everything , knowing the whole country is cheering you on is fantastic			1
' @entity2 are , in fairness , blessed with strength impressive depth at left - back , with @entity63 's @entity62 another arguably worthy of a call - up			1
@entity0 appreciates that breadth of options , but hopes to prove to @entity3 that he deserves to be further up the pecking order			1
' you know , it 's down to ( the manager ) , ' he said			0
' whoever he wants to pick , it is his decision			0
' i 'll just concentrate on my game			0
i 'm confident enough to know that i should be in there , but i do n't pick the team so i 'll just keep playing			0
' @entity0 was one of three @entity6 players in action that night in @entity31 , with @entity80 starting at right - back for @entity2 and @entity82 leading the line for @entity20			1
@entity0 made his move to @entity6 from @entity9 permanent in january after impressing on loan the 29 - year - old striker showed no ill - effects of the scoring drought at club level , glancing the @entity20 ahead at the @entity90 - a goal the striker followed up with a first @entity94 strike since december 20 in saturday 's 2 - 0 defeat of @entity96			1
' i was just thinking it is typical - anyone , anyone but him , ' @entity0 said , laughing			2
' it was good for him to get a goal			0
' the fans have been very supportive , i think			0
every week , even when we 're warming up , you can hear them cheering him on			0
' there 's never been any criticism and he has finally broke his duck and got his goal , so hopefully that just continues now			0
