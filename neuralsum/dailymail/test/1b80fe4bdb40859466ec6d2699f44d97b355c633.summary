@entity0 says his @entity2 players have a point to prove to themselves at @entity4 on monday night			1
the @entity5 are in danger of being sucked into what had previously seemed an unlikely relegation battle given their alarming run of form			1
amid accusations of the team ' playing with their flip - flops on ' , @entity12 have lost four on the spin - scoring just once - and @entity0 admits he does not know where their next point is coming from			1
it is unlikely to arrive at @entity20 , a venue at which they last won in 1994			1
they were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity25 rivals @entity26 seven days ago – a performance @entity0 labelled ' embarrassing ' – and there was a showdown meeting at the club 's training ground this week in which the head coach let his feelings be known			1
@entity0 says his @entity2 players have a point to prove when they face @entity4 on monday @entity0 , though , is hoping that personal pride will kick in when they travel to @entity37			1
' before they go out my message will be simple – ' you have a point to prove , but prove it for yourself , not for me , not for anybody else , but for yourself			2
you owe it for yourself ' , ' he said			2
' the meeting we had on wednesday was non-negotiable			2
we 've had meetings in the past where i like a two - way dialogue			2
' but i got a few things off my chest and it was probably the first time i 've been mr @entity55			2
' after the meeting we trained and there was a great response			0
that hurt me a little bit because i wanted to see that on sunday			0
but at least i got something from them			0
' @entity0 said this week that owner @entity64 has promised to invest in the squad this summer and a major overhaul is expected – out - of - contract players such as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 will be released , while the likes of @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 are also expected to move on			1
@entity2 in training earlier this week for their game against @entity4 on monday in the @entity78 @entity74 ( left ) , @entity79 ( centre ) and @entity81 ( right ) at a training session however , the promise of such renovation has done little to appease fans who are organising a boycott ahead of next sunday 's visit of @entity88			1
@entity0 , in fairness , is caught in the middle of what is a toxic relationship between supporters and the club 's hierarchy			1
and the 50 - year - old admits he has been on the receiving end of criticism from fans			0
' i have to accept what people say			0
as long as it is done the right way and in a constructive manner , i can accept that , ' he said			0
@entity2 were beaten in last weekend 's @entity106 by @entity108 's stunning volley @entity0 has now seen his @entity2 team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger ' it would be easy to say , ' i 've had enough , thanks '			1
i 'm not going to do that and i have still got my enthusiasm			0
' i ca n't hide from what happened on sunday , and i wo n't hide from it			0
what i wo n't take is abuse , and certainly none of my family will take abuse			0
' but i wanted to give this a go because i did n't want to have any regrets			0
i believe in my own ability and i believe if i have got the tools then i could do a good job and a successful job			0
