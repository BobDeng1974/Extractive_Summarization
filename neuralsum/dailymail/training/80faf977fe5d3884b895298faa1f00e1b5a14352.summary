by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 team principal @entity2 feels @entity4 now has his ' mojo back ' following his stunning performance in @entity7			1
the first two days of the @entity7 @entity8 weekend at @entity10 's @entity9 were wretched for the four - times formula one world champion			1
@entity4 initially missed virtually all of friday 's practice sessions due to his car incurring a simple wiring loom fault that took an age to fix			2
on track : @entity4 finished fourth at the @entity7 @entity8 after starting way down in 15th laid back : the @entity19 appeared in a relaxed mood at this week 's two - day test in @entity10 then on saturday he was handed a five - place grid penalty for a gearbox change after losing drive in the early stages of the final part of qualifying			1
but from 15th on the grid , the 26 - year - old @entity19 produced a superb drive to finish fourth behind @entity32 duo @entity31 and @entity33 , and team - mate @entity34			1
' it was a great performance from him on sunday			0
he really went for it , ' said team principal @entity2			2
' he made the strategy work for him , he knew he had to make the passes and i thought it was a fantastic recovery drive			0
' with the fastest lap and the way he hunted down the @entity46 , it looked like he had got his mojo back			0
' @entity34 , meanwhile , continues to thoroughly impress @entity2 , with the @entity49 finishing in the top three - and legitimately so on sunday - for the first time in his @entity52 career			1
@entity34 did finish second in his home race in march , only to be stripped of the result due to a fuel irregularity with his car			2
with the 24 - year - old under contract , @entity2 insists @entity34 will not be leaving the team any time soon , in particular as he has built up a solid partnership with @entity4			1
' @entity61 has done a great job this year and he is so calm in the car , ' said @entity2			0
' he continues to impress us with his speed , his approach , he is enjoying what he is doing			0
you 'll never see him not smiling and it is a pleasure to have him in the team			0
' i ca n't speak highly enough of what @entity61 has done in the first five races and managing this pairing is a walk in the park compared to previous years , but that 's part of the challenge of being a boss			0
' as to @entity34 's future , @entity2 said : ' we 've always believed in continuity and stability and @entity61 's on a long - term contract with the team			1
' i think it would be highly unlikely he will be anywhere else next year			0

@entity4 finished fourth after starting 15th at the @entity7 @entity8
the @entity3 driver , and *reigning* world champion , is yet to win in 2014
@entity2 said @entity34 will be retained for next *season*
