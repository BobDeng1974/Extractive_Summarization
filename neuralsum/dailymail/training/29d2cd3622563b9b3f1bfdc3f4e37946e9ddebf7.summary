the engine of mr @entity1 's car was still running last wednesday when a passer - by found his body slumped behind the steering wheel - with the driver 's window open			1
mr @entity1 was a keen hunter , and @entity10 police soon arrested and placed farmer mr @entity12 under investigation			1
they lived in the same @entity37 - @entity38 - and were both hunters said to be in dispute over a number of issues , including some £ 12,000 which mr @entity12 had lent mr @entity1			1
but today mr @entity12 's body was found hanging in his cell at @entity46 , close to @entity47 and @entity48			1
police said there were no suspicious circumstances			0
it was on september 5 , 2012 that @entity55 engineer @entity53 , 50 , and his wife , @entity57 , 47 , died alongside her mother , @entity58 , 74			2
jail : @entity61 - @entity12 's body was found hanging in his cell at @entity46 ( pictured ) , @entity10 all suffered bullet wounds to the head as they sat in a @entity65 estate car , following an attack by a mystery gunman shooting outside , and at close range			1
the killer , who has never been found , also murdered a @entity10 cyclist called @entity71 , 45 , whose body was found next to the estate car			1
it still had its engine running when the bodies were found by a @entity17 cyclist soon after the killings			1
the @entity80 's daughters , @entity81 , seven at the time , and @entity83 , four , survived the savage attack close to @entity85			2
@entity86 , who is leading the probe into the so - called @entity88 , was also tasked with investigating the @entity90 killing , which police are certain was a ' murder '			2
while refusing to discuss a possible link between the two , mr @entity86 said last week : ' it seems that he was killed by a shotgun after a shot at very close range			2
the van he was driving was stopped in the middle lane , and partially blocking the road			2
the victim had a face wound			0
' map : mr @entity1 was found along an @entity37 road near @entity25 , 50 miles from where the @entity80 family were found in their car near @entity109 @entity38 mayor @entity110 said mr @entity1 was a ' well - known figure , a dynamic worker who was heavily involved in the local community '			1
police said that mr @entity1 had ' spoken to the attacker ' before the shooting , which is believed to have happened overnight on tuesday to wednesday			1
mr @entity1 had a ' bullet in the temple , ' said a police source			1
he said he ran a successful business specialising in painting and decorating , and was also a keen hunter			0
in september , mr @entity86 said whoever was responsible for the 2012 killings may have got away with the ' perfect crime '			0
' the further we advance , the less conviction we have , ' he said , saying the enquiry ' lacks the element of a witness which allows everything to be opened up			0
on a number of occasions we thought we were on the right track			0
' mr @entity86 said that ' after two years ' hundreds of people had been interviewed , thousands of documents read , and numerous forensic tests carried out ' but there is no priority line of investigation that stands out '			0
previous case : @entity53 ( left ) , 50 , his wife , @entity57 , 47 , and her mother , @entity58 , 74 , all died after being shot from close range in their car ( right ) two years ago			1
the gunman has never been caught conceding that the inquiry could go on for years to come , mr @entity86 said : ' we have tried everything possible , but we 're perhaps we 're in the presence of the perfect crime			0
' there have been claims that mr @entity80 was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother @entity159 , 54 , of @entity160 , @entity55			0
@entity159 was last year arrested under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a lack of evidence			0
investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained marksman , and to know the local area extremely well			2
this has led to well - sourced theories that mr @entity71 , the cyclist , may have been the principal target			2
he had recently left his wife and two children two live with a multi-millionaire heiress , with whom he had just had a baby , and there were said to be tensions in the relationship			0
the 2011 killings took place in an isolated layby on a mountain road not far from the tiny village of @entity185			0
a detective involved in the case said : ' the reality is that whoever did it left no forensic evidence , and disappeared without trace			0
it is sadly quite possible that this will never be solved			0
