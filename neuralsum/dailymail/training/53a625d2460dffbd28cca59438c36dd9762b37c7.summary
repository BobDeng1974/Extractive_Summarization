by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 will beef up the comfort of air travel next year as the airline moves to introduce additional leg room for each class of traveller			1
in an announcement which aims to put it on top of @entity14 's list of air carriers , the company launched its new look cabins for 2015 across its @entity19 and @entity18 aircraft 's on wednesday			1
three classes - economy plus , business lite and the futuristic looking business first - will be part of the re-design with each category equipped with loads of additional leg room			1
' the extra-wide and extra-long flat beds will debut on @entity2 's @entity18 330 in march 2015 , with all six of the twin - aisle transcontinental jets upgraded by july			1
@entity2 will position the new seats as a ' business first ' product , although it has n't yet settled on a marketing moniker for the seats			2
the 1 - 2 - 1 layout on both the @entity48 and @entity49 will provide direct aisle access for every passenger			0
business class passengers will see a newly - designed business class bar with face - to - face service for up to four seated guests @entity2 ceo @entity56 said @entity2 is moving in to uncharted territory as it looks to trump rival @entity58			1
' we 've taken the fight to @entity58 , this will widen the gap in our favour , ' he said			0
' i would classify this as more ' business first ' than business class			0
' details on the company 's economy plus seating are yet to be revealed but all three classes will see seats removed in order to make way for the additional room			2
a prototype of the new business class bed was launched today by ceo @entity56 as well as being 80 inches wide the bed will also offer 28 inches of space in width mr @entity56 said premium economy has been designed for budget business passengers looking for a more comfortable journey			1
' this is going to be a more exclusive cabin ' he said			0
' the intention is n't economy plus but ' business lite ' , so while we pitch our new business class at halfway between business and first , premium economy will be halfway between economy and business but certainly closer to business class			2
' this will also include an upgrade of the meals with consulting chef @entity101 ' already working on a new menu for us			0
' the announcement looks to move @entity2 atop the list of @entity14 's air travel companies trumping @entity58 the 1 - 2 - 1 layout on both the @entity48 and @entity49 will provide direct aisle access for every passenger			1
however , the premium economy bar will be axed as part of the make - over and a new bar introduced for business class guests that will offer face - to - face service			2
the redesign at the pointy end of the plane is based on the @entity121 bed design from @entity122 and customised by @entity124 - based design agency @entity123			0
decked out in contemporary charcoal with brushed aluminium trimming , the bed is 80 inches long and 28 inches wide			0
installing the new seats will see @entity2 's business class cabin on the @entity18 shrink from 24 seats to 20 , but @entity56 promised the fares ' will remain competitive ' against @entity58			1
' everywhere we 've operated we 've always brought fares down , so they have to be competitive , but that said , people will be prepared to pay for this product , ' he said .			0
