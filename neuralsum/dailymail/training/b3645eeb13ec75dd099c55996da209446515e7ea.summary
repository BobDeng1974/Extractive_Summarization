do not follow me if you want to win a medal , was @entity4 ’s friendly advice to @entity6 team - mate @entity5 before he stunned the world by setting a world record of 1min 40.91sec to win @entity10 800 metres gold at @entity11			1
he knew nobody would be able to live with the pace he planned to run			0
@entity4 ’s was the stand - out performance of the @entity15 ; arguably not only on the track but of the entire @entity10			1
@entity17 , who held the 800m world record for 16 years , called it the most extraordinary piece of running he had ever seen and the greatest 800m run			1
it will be impossible for @entity4 to recreate the magic of those 100 seconds at @entity24 over the next three days , but we should still expect another majestic performance from one of the world ’s greatest athletes in one of the track ’s toughest disciplines			1
‘ the 800m is the most unforgiving distance , ’ said @entity17			0
‘ you are running 80 per cent of the race without oxygen			0
i call it “ the killing zone ”			0
i think 800m is the toughest distance on the track			0
it demands so many different things : the endurance of a 5,000m runner and the speed of a world - class 800m runner			2
’ to make things even harder , @entity4 will face @entity65 from @entity66			1
the 20 - year - old won silver in @entity68 and beat @entity4 into fifth place in @entity70 this month by running 1:42.45 , the fastest time in the world this year			1
@entity4 missed last season with a knee injury , but returned to @entity75 soil in the @entity77 meeting at @entity24 to win comfortably in 1:43.34			1
@entity4 , after all , knows only one way to run — from the front — which is why experts believe he could go even quicker			1
talking tactics : @entity4 's coach , brother @entity82 ( left ) , says his man likes to lead from the front after previous disappointments more to come : some experts believe @entity4 is capable of running under 100 seconds in @entity36 @entity86 - day 5 review dr @entity88 , lead physiologist at the @entity89 , said : ‘ aerodynamically , sitting on someone else ’s shoulder saves you a lot of energy , which you can save for that final kick			1
‘ but @entity4 likes to run from the front , usually as soon as he can break after the first 200m , which is run in lanes			1
that ’s what made his performance in @entity68 so remarkable			0
‘ he has to work harder and the people trying to hang on behind him are benefiting from running in his draft			0
he could perhaps run even faster if there were people he could sit behind			0
you need a pacemaker who ’s the world ’s best over 400m and can hang on until 600m			2
’ @entity4 has been coy about breaking the 100 - second barrier but said : ‘ @entity68 was an @entity10 final and i did it without a pacemaker , ’ he said			1
‘ if i can catch the right pacing and the right conditions we might do better			0
’ running from the front was a tactic the former 400m athlete , whose father @entity118 won @entity10 gold in the 4x400m relay in 1968 , adopted after he failed to make the final at the @entity121 in @entity122			2
@entity4 ’s coach , @entity124 missionary brother @entity123 , said : ‘ i think he just turned over a new leaf and said : “ i ’m never going to be caught like that again ”			1
’ in 2010 @entity4 set two world 800m records in a week			1
a comparison of @entity4 and @entity17 's most memorable races @entity123 first spotted @entity4 running 200m in 2004 and invited him to a training camp			1
the 16 - year - old was given a pair of second - hand size 10 spikes and , in his first outing over two laps of the track , he ran 1min 50secs			0
@entity4 has clearly long been an exceptional athlete			1
the question is : how good could he be if someone does have the talent to follow him ? dr @entity143 , head of biomechanics at the @entity89 , discusses @entity4 's best attributes			2
standing tall at 6ft 3in , @entity4 is a tall athlete — much taller than @entity75 ’s finest 800m runner , @entity17 — and he maintains an upward stance while running			2
a lot of athletes tilt their hips but he does n’t do that , or lean too far forwards			0
@entity154 like @entity40 he has a long stride length and covers lots of distance with his long limbs , but he does n’t over-stride or place his foot too far in front of him , which would act as a @entity162 ’s gait and stride pattern were shorter and quicker but @entity4 ’s stride length allows him to maintain velocity throughout the whole race			2
@entity167 he ’s very smooth in the way he runs			0
there is not much vertical displacement — everything ’s horizontal — which means he does n’t lose energy unnecessarily			0
@entity4 does n’t bounce like a lot of marathon or long distance runners			2
muscle man @entity4 is a very muscular guy , he does n’t seem to rotate the upper body too much and is very stable in his core , which gives him a lot of control and does not waste energy			2
total package there have got to be natural genetics at play , in terms of his muscle fibres and his height , and he really does have the ideal body type			0
but you can tell he has worked very hard on his biomechanics			0
he ’s not perfect but he ’s technically very , very good and , like @entity40 , he knows what works for him .			0

@entity4 is favourite to win gold in the 800 metres at the @entity15
he set a new world record at the @entity11
some have tipped him to break the 100 second barrier this week
the @entity6 is one of the biggest names competing in @entity36
