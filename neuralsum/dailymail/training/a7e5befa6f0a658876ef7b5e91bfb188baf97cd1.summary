by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:44 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:46 est , 23 december 2013 a recent spate of unusual weather has n’t changed the question on the minds of many – ‘ what about a @entity9 ? ’ chances are that if there is snow on the ground now , it will stick around the next two days			2
the @entity15 and the @entity16 are a virtual lock			1
the rest of the @entity19 may not be so festive			1
a white @entity9 is defined by there being at least one inch of snow on the ground , according to the @entity24			2
widespread : @entity25 is possible for a wide swath of the northern half of the country , but most of it is not expected to amount to any sizable accumulation too warm : it is simply too warm in most of the country for snow to fall or stick around most of the @entity36 has little shot at a white @entity9			1
warmer than average temperatures the past few days – highs eclipsed 70 degrees sunday in @entity39 – and abundant rain have washed away any snow there may have been			2
temperatures will cool back to around freezing by the holiday , but no snow is forecast for most of the region except areas normally affected by lake effect snow			1
the mountains of northern @entity49 and @entity50 are already packed with snow and received mainly ice during this weekend ’s storm			1
they should be white come wednesday			0
the mid-atlantic and southeast have virtually no shot at snow in the next few days , nor is any on the ground			0
significantly above average temperatures and recent rains washed away any hopes those states may have had			0
let it snow , let it snow , let it snow : the northern @entity16 are the region most likely to have a @entity9 - it will be snowing @entity67 slight cooling : temperatures will back off from record weekend highs , but not enough in most places for snow the northern central @entity19 is already buried in snow and ice			1
it should remain so for at least the next few days			0
expect to ring in the holiday with sleighs and snow balls from @entity81 to @entity82 , all the way up to @entity76 and @entity77			2
further west into @entity83 and @entity84 , as well as all of the @entity15 , a white @entity9 is virtually guaranteed			1
significant amounts of snow are already on the ground and are n’t expected to melt by the time presents are open wednesday morning			0
as usual , the @entity89 will not have a white @entity9			0
what the region gains in mostly amazing weather the rest of the country envies , they give up in having snow on @entity9			1
parts of the @entity97 have a very good chance at a @entity9 , but they are confined mostly to the mountains and higher elevations			0
do n’t expect snow in @entity101			0
the good news is that despite the lack of snow on the ground , most regions will have a beautiful day to celebrate the @entity9 holiday – only the upper great lakes are expected to receive any significant precipitation			2
it is expected to be snow .			0

the @entity15 and @entity16 are a virtual lock - so is *extreme* northern @entity50
the @entity16 will see snowfall on the holiday
the rest of the country is unlikely to be as *fortunate*
