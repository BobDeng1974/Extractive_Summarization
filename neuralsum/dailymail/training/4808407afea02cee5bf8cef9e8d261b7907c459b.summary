seen side by side for the first time , this pair of pets look like they could be mother and daughter			2
while there is 12 years between them , however , these two dachshunds have identical genes – and are @entity13 's first cloned dogs			1
scientists took a skin sample from the older dog , @entity17 , to help manufacture a genetically identical embryo			1
the result , @entity20 , was born in march and was flown to @entity13 on saturday after being cared for by experts in @entity22 for five months			1
two of a kind : @entity13 's first clone dog ' minnie winnie ' with her 12 - year - old genetic mother ' @entity17 ' @entity29 's owner @entity28 , from @entity30 , won a competition to have her dog reproduced from her dna in a laboratory in @entity22 the cloning process would normally cost £ 60,000 , but owner @entity28 , 29 , had it done for free after winning a competition			1
at the weekend the puppy met her elderly double for the first time , and while they are not identical – @entity17 naturally shows the signs of ageing – the resemblance between the two was clear to see			1
miss @entity28 said : ' @entity20 looks just like @entity17 did when she was a puppy			1
@entity44 has put on weight and looks grey now but they have the same markings			0

' @entity53 , a caterer from @entity30 , @entity54 , was given @entity17 as an 18th birthday present and credits the dog with helping her through spells of bulimia and depression			1

@entity20 , was born in march and was flown to @entity13 on saturday after being cared for by experts in @entity22 for five months @entity28 won a @entity22 contest to clone her dog , a technique would usually cost £ 60,000 the dachshund is the first dog in @entity13 to be cloned , having been imported from @entity22 ' my boyfriend joked that we should get her cloned , but we never thought that would have been possible			1
then we entered a competition in a newspaper and ended up winning			2
' scientists at the @entity78 flew @entity17 's skin cells to their lab in @entity81 in @entity22 , where the dna was extracted and placed into a donor egg			1
after fertilisation the egg was inserted into a dog surrogate to develop into an embryo			2

the pup weighed only 1lb at birth and has been kept in quarantine since then			0
on saturday , the dog made the 15 - hour flight to @entity54 to start a new life with its double			2

she likes to sleep and it 's quite hard to make her walk			0
miss @entity28 plans to have the two dogs follow her down the aisle when she marries fiance @entity128 , 30 paws for thought : campaigners have criticised the cloning practice as ethically dubious @entity20 , the cloned puppy of @entity28 who won a competition from @entity22 company @entity78 to clone her pet the only thing that @entity53 was unsure about is the temperament and personality of her dog - clone , and she 'll have to wait for her pup to grow up to be able to tell ' in contrast , @entity20 is , at the moment , very playful and bouncy and excitable			1
she loves going out to the park			0
' @entity29 has gone slightly off her food because she 's in a new environment , and at the moment will only eat fresh meat			0
we keep putting out doggie biscuits for the puppy and then we 'll come back and @entity17 will be eating them			2
@entity28 chose to clone her dog because of the irreplaceable bond she had to the original hound who saw her through so much of her life the pup weighed only 1lb at birth and has been kept in quarantine since then ' but one thing they both have in common is they sleep together in my bed every night , and they tend to sleep right through			1
