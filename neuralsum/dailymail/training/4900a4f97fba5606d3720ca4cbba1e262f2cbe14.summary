the @entity8 governor told @entity13 there is a ‘ distinct possibility ’ that @entity6 would have to leave an independent @entity16			1
he also said taxpayers in the rest of the @entity19 would be forced to bail out @entity16 in the event of crisis if it was allowed to keep the pound			2
the comments were a further setback for @entity25 and the ‘ yes ’ campaign ahead of the referendum in september			0
mr @entity25 , first minister of the @entity28 and leader of the @entity30 , wants to create a ‘ sterling zone ’ with the rest of the @entity19 if the country goes it alone			0
but chancellor @entity34 has already ruled out a currency union between an independent @entity16 and the rest of the @entity19 in a move backed by @entity38 and the @entity39			2
and firms including @entity41 and @entity42 have warned that they may move south of the border if @entity16 votes to go it alone			2
giving evidence to the @entity3 yesterday , mr @entity2 raised the prospect of @entity16 ’s biggest bank deserting the country after independence			1
asked if @entity6 would have to move , the central bank chief said : ‘ it is a distinct possibility			1
’ @entity53 law dictates that banks have their headquarters in states where they do most of their business and have the most customers			1
but both @entity6 and @entity59 do more business in @entity8 than in @entity16 - raising the prospect that they will have to move if @entity16 declares independence			1
mr @entity2 also told @entity13 that any ‘ informal adoption of sterling ’ by an independent @entity16 without an agreed currency union would mean the @entity8 could no longer stand behind its banks			1
and he suggested the rest of the @entity19 could end up bailing out @entity16 if it was hit by a financial crisis			0
@entity53 law dictates that banks have their headquarters in states where they do most business he said ‘ when push came to shove ’ stricken countries in the eurozone had to be rescued despite a ‘ no - bailout clause ’			1
the @entity77 said : ‘ would it be credible to stand by if an independent @entity16 were to be in fiscal difficulties ? ’ but mr @entity2 dismissed claims that he thought a currency union was a bad idea for the @entity19			2
‘ i have been absolutely clear and i will continue to be clear that what i have tried to do , what the @entity7 has tried to do , and what we will continue to do is to draw attention to economic issues which the interested parties can address and then others can make the judgments , ’ he told @entity13			0
‘ at no time have i said , or will i say , that i do not support or that i advocate a currency union , either side of the debate			0
’ the move would be a blow for @entity25 who wants to create a ' sterling zone ' a spokesman for the pro-union @entity102 campaign said : ‘ this is an important contribution from the @entity8 governor			0
' what people in @entity16 need is clarity from @entity25 about his @entity108 for what would replace the pound			0
would we have to sign up to the euro , as @entity2 said , or would we set up an unproven separate currency ? ‘ no doubt @entity25 ’s response will be the same as every other time an expert has questioned his plans - @entity2 is wrong and only the first minister is right			0
it simply is n’t credible			0
’ @entity30 mp @entity120 , the party ’s @entity3 spokesman and a member of the @entity3 , said : ‘ i am pleased that the governor took this opportunity to confirm the @entity8 ’s neutrality on the issue of @entity16 independence			2
