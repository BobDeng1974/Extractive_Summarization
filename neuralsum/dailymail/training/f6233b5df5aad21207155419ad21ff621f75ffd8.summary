by @entity0 and @entity1 the surrogate mother at the centre of the controversy surrounding a baby boy who was allegedly abandoned by his @entity7 parents after they found out he had down syndrome may face charges in @entity12			1
@entity12 medical authorities are threatening to take action against @entity15 , 21 , as the @entity16 and other agencies crack down on medical institutions and clinics linked to the commercial surrogacy the ministry calls ' illegal '			1
@entity12 reports said the ministry was also considering charges against ms @entity15 who is a food stall seller from the southern province of @entity27			1
the @entity41 couple , @entity40 and @entity42 - from @entity7 - have denied they abandoned the baby boy and returned to @entity7 with his healthy twin sister			1
the couple claims ms @entity15 ' misled ' the world over the events that led to them leaving the baby behind in @entity12			2
but on tuesday the @entity12 woman denied this had happened			0
ms @entity15 was paid a total of $ 16,000 to be the surrogate mother of @entity36 , seven months old , who was then allegedly abandoned by @entity40 and @entity42 ' i have never lied or hidden anything			1
the truth is the truth ; it 's up to society to make their own judgment , ' ms @entity15 told @entity61 ( @entity61 )			2
it has also been reported @entity36 's @entity7 father was a convicted paedophile			1
' personally , when i heard the news i was shocked but i ca n't say anything much right now , ' ms @entity15 said at a press conference in her hometown , adding she would ' leave it to the law ' to see if she could get the girl back			2
but despite the threat of the @entity12 law working against ms @entity15 in her home country , it could be the exact opposite here in @entity7			1
professor @entity75 , a surrogacy law expert at @entity77 's @entity76 , said ms @entity15 could seek custody of the daughter through the @entity7 courts			1
' she 's a legal parent			0
if she turned up in the @entity81 tomorrow , she could seek the return of that child , if that 's what she wanted , ' @entity75 told @entity85			0
meanwhile , seven - month - old baby @entity36 is receiving treatment at a @entity88 hospital , where he is being treated for a congenital heart condition			1
a spokesman for the hospital said the baby was now receiving specialist care and is ' in safe hands '			0
it is alleged the @entity7 couple abandoned @entity36 to his fate after they found out he had down syndrome and a congenital heart condition initially @entity40 and @entity42 told the @entity100 they had no knowledge of the other child , but a statement released on tuesday said they were told of the baby 's existence but that it had a congenital heart condition and was not expected to live			1
the case has spurred widespread debate , putting @entity12 under the spotlight because of its weak legal framework overseeing surrogacy and in vitro - fertilisation ( @entity113 ) laws			2
@entity12 law firm @entity115 and @entity116 , which says it will cover surrogacy and @entity113 cases on its website , warns of possible ' complicated legal issues '			0
' while surrogacy in @entity12 is currently an option and a rapidly - growing area of medical innovation , there are a number of legal considerations prospective parents should consider , ' the firm told @entity1			0
the lawyers said @entity12 currently has no laws or published case decisions directly relating to the practice of surrogacy , ' and in essence surrogacy is neither legal nor illegal in @entity12 '			0
agencies and health clinics openly engage in locating surrogate mothers and egg donors			0
' @entity12 's @entity141 has taken a cautious approach to the practices of @entity113 implantation , egg donation , and surrogacy ; these practices are still in a legal and medical " grey area " , ' the firm said			2
investigations are now under way by @entity12 's @entity151 in healing under the @entity152 ( @entity153 ) into the surrogacy service clinics			0
there are reported to be an estimated 20 surrogacy agencies , most said to be foreign - owned drawing in an estimated $ 133 million annually .			0
