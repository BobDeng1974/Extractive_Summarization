by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the nation ’s pig farmers are struggling to get to grips with a deadly virus that has wiped out more than 10 percent of the animals in less than a year and sent retail pork prices soaring to record highs			1
the highly contagious killer stalking @entity12 hog farms is known as @entity14 virus			2
puzzled scientists are searching for its origins and a cure , while farmers are suffering devastating financial losses			1
since june 2013 as many as seven million pigs have died in the @entity12 due to the virus , said @entity23 , president of @entity25 - based @entity24 and consultant to the @entity27			1
the nation 's pig farmers are struggling to get to grips with a deadly virus that has wiped out more than 10 percent of the animals in less than a year and sent retail pork prices soaring to record highs @entity35 data shows the nation 's hog herd at about 63 million as of march 1 , 2014			1
@entity38 was first diagnosed in @entity39 last may and has spread within a year to 30 states with no reliable cure in sight			0
@entity12 packing plants may produce almost two percent less pork in 2014 , according to @entity45 , @entity35 agricultural economist			2
last week the @entity35 responded to calls for more reliable data and classified @entity38 as a reportable disease , a step that requires the pork industry to track its spread			1
‘ it 's a positive step that i wish they had taken last summer when it became obvious this was spreading rapidly , ’ said @entity23			0
most farmers and researchers believe @entity38 is transmitted from pig to pig by contact with pig manure			1
‘ something like a tablespoon of @entity38 infected manure is roughly enough to infect the entire @entity12 hog herd , ’ said @entity62 , swine biosecurity specialist at @entity64			0
pork prices have soared to an all - time high of $ 3.83 a pound the @entity27 has spent about $ 1.7 million researching the virus , which is nearly always fatal in pigs younger than 21 days			1
with pork prices at an all - time high of $ 3.83 a pound , the loss of baby pigs cuts into profits for hog farmers			1
‘ if you have four weeks of mortality in a @entity38 break , that 's pretty devastating to the financial wellbeing of that operation , ’ said @entity81 , a @entity82 hog farmer			0
@entity38 does not pose a risk to human health and is not a food safety issue , the @entity35 says			0
months of forensic research so far have turned up no clear evidence of how the disease entered the @entity12			0
the virus is nearly identical to one that infected pigs in @entity100 's @entity99 province , according to a report published in the @entity102			1
researchers also are exploring whether the widespread use of pig - blood byproducts in hog feed might have introduced the disease			1
infected piglets can not absorb nutrients from food or water , they contract diarrhea and die from dehydration there have been outbreaks in recent years in @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and parts of @entity120 , though in milder forms than seen in the @entity12 and @entity100			0
the disease has taken root in @entity124 , too , where the pork industry is deeply integrated with @entity12 pork production			1
@entity38 thrives in cold , damp environments , and after slowing last summer its spread accelerated during the past winter			0
in mid-december , there were over 1,500 cases but by mid-april , that had more than tripled to 5,790 , according to @entity35 data			0
altogether , of nearly 15,000 samples tested for @entity38 about 32 percent have been positive			0
the virus ‘ acts like a lawn mower ’ on the villi in a pig 's intestines , which are the tiny projections that aid digestion , said @entity143 , chief of animal health at the @entity39 @entity35			2
with their villi gone , the piglets can not absorb nutrients from food or water , contract diarrhea and die from dehydration			0
so far , no vaccine has been able to completely protect pigs from the disease			2
an @entity25 company , @entity155 , has made some progress , while pharmaceutical giants @entity158 and @entity159 have joined with universities to begin vaccine development			0
‘ there is no silver bullet for @entity38 , ’ said @entity162 , marketing manager at @entity163 , which developed a feed additive designed to reduce risk of the disease			0
the disease is spreading even as farmers and truckers impose stricter cleanliness measures across the so - called @entity174 , which stretches across most of the @entity12 @entity175 and @entity176 and extends south to @entity177 , the nation 's no. 2 hog producer			1
bright yellow signs marked ‘ @entity183 ’ are popping up outside @entity177 farms warning the virus is present			1
one - third of @entity177 's 3,000 hog farms have been struck by @entity38 since the first diagnosed case there in june 2013 , the state says			2
so many piglets have died that @entity189 , a farmer who fattens hogs for market in southeastern @entity192 , is having difficulty finding animals			0
his herd is down 25 percent to 6,000 pigs , costing him more than $ 100,000 .			2
