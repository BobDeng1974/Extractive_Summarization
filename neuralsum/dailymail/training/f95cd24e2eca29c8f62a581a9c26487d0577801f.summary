after five years nothing had happened , so mrs @entity1 went to see her gp			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ @entity8 underwent tests and he was fine , so we knew that it must be something that was wrong with me			1
‘ but i had a series of tests too , and although the doctors said that i had slightly polycystic ovaries , they said it was unexplained infertility			1
they said there was no reason why i should n’t fall pregnant and we should keep trying			2
‘ @entity8 was reassuring me that it would be alright and we would be parents soon			1
we never gave up hope			1

everywhere i looked , i saw mothers and babies , and it was heartbreaking			0

i would try and be happy for friends and family when they fell pregnant , but i was devastated inside			2
‘ when my periods finally stopped , i thought that was it			0
we ’d already been trying for 13 years with no success , i thought that was definitely the end of the road for us			0
we never gave up hope totally , we were always hoping for a miracle , but realistically we thought our chances were probably over			1
’ at the beginning of last april , mrs @entity1 was lying in the bath when she felt a sudden fluttering movement in her stomach			1
she said : ‘ i ’d never felt anything like it in my life			0
i could feel this movement			0
he wanted me to do a pregnancy test but i did n’t want to , as i thought it would make me upset when it came out negative			0
‘ but @entity8 insisted , so we did a test and it was positive			1
i could n’t believe what i was seeing			0
after all these years i was finally looking at a positive pregnancy test			0
’ @entity1 went for a scan at @entity102 and doctors delivered the most surprising news			1

and it was nearly here			0
