@entity16 , whose death sparked the 2011 riots in @entity19 , was shot twice by a marksman who had halted his taxi			1
officers insist the 29 - year - old had a gun wrapped in a sock and was raising it ready to use lethal force			1
but a witness , known only as @entity28 , insists police took a weapon from the taxi and left it near the scene			1
the claim emerged yesterday just before the jury at @entity16 ’s inquest was taken to the street in @entity37 , north @entity38 , where he was shot in august 2011			1
@entity40 , @entity41 , counsel to the inquest , told jurors they would hear evidence from @entity45 ‘ she lived nearby and she said she was close enough to see the colour of the gloves somebody was wearing when doing cpr ( on @entity16 ) , ’ he said			2
‘ i need to explore with @entity28 whether her evidence suggests the police took the gun from the minicab and planted it			1
' all of that evidence will give you the opportunity to explore that possibility			0
’ the inquest has heard that the officer who pulled the trigger , known by his codename of @entity63 , says he acted in self defence			0
the marksman has made a statement insisting he saw @entity16 lift his right arm and point a gun toward him			1
but when police looked on the roadside near his body they found nothing			0
a handgun with one bullet in it was later found behind a railing , between 10 and 20 feet from @entity16 ’s body			2
mr @entity40 told the inquest at the @entity81 : ‘ common sense will tell you when you ’re in a fast - moving dramatic situation , however highly trained you are , you may miss things			2
‘ so the gun may have been thrown , it may have been kicked there later on by somebody trying to do first aid			0
’ key evidence : a photograph of the gun , shown to the jury at the @entity81 as part of the two - month inquest case : photograph shows a gun in a sock found 10 - 20ft away from @entity4 , 29 , when he was shot dead by police in @entity37 aftermath : @entity129 caught this image of paramedics treating @entity4 after he was shot yesterday the jury was taken to @entity134 in east @entity38 where @entity16 was allegedly given a handgun by @entity136 , who has been jailed for 11 years			1
the jury was then taken on the route @entity16 travelled in the minicab from @entity134 to @entity37 where three unmarked police cars following him conducted a ‘ hard stop ’			1
@entity16 was a member of @entity143 , one of @entity146 ’s most notorious gangs , and was suspected of being on his way to @entity148 to carry out a murder when the minicab was intercepted , the inquest has been told			2
counsel for the inquest @entity40 , @entity41 , said armed officers tried to shock @entity16 ‘ into submission ’ by performing a ‘ hard stop ’ on the taxi by blocking it with three unmarked police cars			1
bereft family : @entity159 , the aunt of @entity4 , arrives at the inquest into his death at the @entity81 with @entity163 's brother @entity162 ( right ) and one other family : @entity162 and @entity166 , brothers of @entity4 visit the scene of his fatal shooting in @entity37 this afternoon addressing the jury , he said : ‘ regrettably you will hear it did n’t work , in the sense that mr @entity16 was n’t shocked into submission , ’ he said			1
‘ he got out of the minicab and he ran			0
you will also hear , of course , from @entity63 that he was running with a gun in his hand and he started to bring that gun up into the aim ( position )			0
‘ that police officer will tell you that the reason he fired was because he saw what he believed to be a gun wrapped in a sock in mr @entity16 ’s hand and that he was presenting it in a way that was threatening and that he fired in self - defence			1
‘ one of the shots hit mr @entity16 on the inside of his right bicep , but did n’t do very much damage			0
evidence : photograph shows the bullet - holed jacket worn by @entity4 on the night he was shot @entity129 captured the taxi in which the father - of - four was travelling when it was stopped by armed police			2
the jury visited the scene yesterday ‘ the second went through his chest and came out his back going through his aorta , the main artery which pumps blood into the heart , and was fatal			0
’ less than half an hour before the shooting @entity16 had allegedly picked up a gun from @entity136			2
detectives had set up a covert surveillance operation on @entity16 and five other suspects because of their believed links to the gang			0
the criminal network has been linked to dozens of murders since its members started drugs trafficking on the notorious @entity221 in @entity37 from the mid- 1980s			0
mr @entity40 said @entity222 had set up @entity223 to thwart the illegal activities of the @entity143 gang			0
image shows a dummy in similar jacket to the one worn by @entity4 on the night he was shot and the entry points of the bullets a photograph of the taxi which @entity4 was travelling in on the night he was shot in @entity37			2
the jury must decide if the gun was taken by police and planted ‘ they were concentrating on a gang based in @entity37 called for short @entity143 and they believed that mr @entity16 was a gang member and was going to pick up a gun from a man called @entity243 or @entity136 , ’ he said			1
he also told the jury that @entity16 and @entity136 appeared to speak on the phone several times before the gun was allegedly handed over			0
mr @entity40 told the jury that they will need to decide if @entity16 was holding gun when he was shot , if it was necessary for the marksman to fire twice and if the police operation was planned and implemented in a way that minimised lethal force			1
the hearing , which is expected to last two months , continues			0
