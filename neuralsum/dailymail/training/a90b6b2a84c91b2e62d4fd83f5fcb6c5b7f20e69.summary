by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 continued his long love affair with the @entity4 by posting the fastest times in both friday practice sessions ahead of the @entity8 @entity7			1
@entity2 has become a master of the tight , twisty track , the slowest permanent facility on the @entity13 calendar , claiming four poles and four victories in seven attempts			0
another win on sunday would make the 29 - year - old the most successful driver at the circuit of all time			0
he is currently tied with @entity21 on four wins apiece			0
quickest in @entity33 when the medium - compound @entity35 tyre was used throughout , @entity2 posted a time of one minute 25.814 seconds , finishing 0.183secs clear of @entity30			1
come @entity41 when the drivers were allowed a run on the soft rubber , the quicker of the two choices this weekend , @entity2 improved to 1:24.482 , with @entity30 down by 0.238			1
the fact they again finished one - two was no surprise as @entity31 have no equal this season , with just two drivers within a second of the pair after the two 90 - minute runs			1
heading for the track : @entity2 leaves the @entity31 garage during the second practice session driving seat : @entity30 leads the @entity57 but he was over two tenths down on @entity2 both were world champions , with outgoing champion @entity61 0.629 off the pace in his @entity63 , followed by double title - holder @entity64 for @entity66 , 0.955 adrift			1
the second session was not without its difficulties for @entity31 , though , as @entity2 at one stage complained of a loss of braking			2
that will likely have sounded a few alarm bells on the pit wall in light of @entity2 's accident during qualifying last saturday for the @entity78 @entity7 when he suffered a 30g impact into a tyre wall after a right - front brake disc failure			1
as for @entity30 , there were engine concerns just over two - thirds of the way through the session , although neither man seemed overly burdened as long runs were eventually undertaken			2
off road : @entity90 's @entity89 takes a trip across the gravel trap during the second practice session @entity94 takes a virtual spin round @entity4 there was one comical radio moment late on when @entity30 said : ' some advice please			2
' ' on traffic ? ' came the reply			0
' no , on driving ! ' said @entity30			0
it appeared strange the current leader should ask how to drive his car , but he was told to look at his exit out of turn two in order to gain a better approach into turn three			0
behind the leading quartet was @entity90 's @entity89 , followed by the second @entity66 and @entity63 respectively of @entity111 and @entity112 , the latter 1.5secs down			1
despite a run of three successive podiums - the first @entity117 driver to conjure such a feat for 11 years - @entity119 was only eighth , albeit on a track not expected to suit his car this weekend			0
@entity90 's @entity122 , 1.752secs back , and @entity124 in his @entity117 completed the top 10 , with @entity127 's @entity126 down in 21st and just over four seconds in arrears .			0

@entity2 finished ahead of @entity30 in both practice sessions
@entity2 has won the @entity8 @entity7 on four occasions
the @entity134 is 14 points adrift of @entity31 team - mate @entity30 in title race
@entity61 was 3rd in his @entity63 with @entity66 's @entity64 *4th*
