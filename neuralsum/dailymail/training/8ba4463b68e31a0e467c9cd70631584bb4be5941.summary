by @entity0 a careless council has been accused of wasting taxpayers ' money after it painted new white lines on a potholed road before covering them over with tarmac			1
flood water had ravaged @entity8 , in @entity9 , leaving it pockmarked with dozens of dangerous craters			1
@entity12 workers arrived but ignored the potholes and instead painted new white lines through them - only to return days later to re-tarmac the whole road			1
before : @entity12 staff went to @entity8 to re-paint the white lines but ignored the potholes after : despite painting new white lines , workers were called back to the street days later to re-tarmac the road taxi driver @entity23 , 42 , of @entity24 , @entity9 , said : ' it ’s shocking			1
why ca n’t they set it up where somebody does the potholes first and then paint the lines ? ' however much it costs to fill in the lines on the road they are going to have to do it again			2
' @entity36 is always saying , well we have n’t got the money to repair the roads			0
well stop wasting it then			0
it ’s really not rocket science			0
' a spokesman from @entity12 yesterday admitted it should have painted the road markings after the repair work was completed and pledged to spend another £ 3million tackling potholes in the county			1
he said : ' we have just experienced the wettest winter on record			0
in many cases we ’ve seen a week ’s rain fall in just a few hours , leading to widespread flooding and high water levels			2
this has led to an increase in potholes			0
' we are poised to begin a countywide drive to fix potholes now that the weather is becoming drier			0
' in this instance the white - lining , which was also essential maintenance work , should have followed the pothole repairs that have now taken place in @entity8 , @entity24			2

flood water had *ruined* @entity8 , in @entity9 , leaving it pockmarked
@entity12 workers arrived by ignored the potholes
