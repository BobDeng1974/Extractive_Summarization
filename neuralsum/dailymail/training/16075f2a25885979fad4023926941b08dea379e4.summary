by @entity0 a lucky hillwalker was given a personal air show by the most famous aerobatics team in the world when he witnessed a training session by the @entity7 's @entity6			1
@entity8 , 43 , was enjoying a peaceful walk through the @entity11 hills in central wales when the stillness of his surroundings was broken by the roar of the afterburner jet engines from the iconic aircraft			1
the nine - plane flying team were using the area to practice low - level flying ahead of this summer 's air shows , allowing mr @entity8 to get some of the first pictures of their new @entity24 tail design , painted on to mark their 50th anniversary			1
the father - of - three said : ' it was spectacular , exciting , noisy and totally unforgettable			2
it was like they were putting on a show just for me			0
' it was such a buzz when the planes went screaming past			0
sometimes i did n't even lift my camera up because i was just standing there in amazement			0
' the @entity6 had left their base in @entity39 in singles before flying through the loop - named after the nearby town of @entity43 - and then heading back to their headquarters			2
mr @entity8 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , was able to climb up the hillside so he was higher than the @entity50 aircraft which were at times just 200ft above the ground mr @entity8 said : ' i 've always been aircraft mad and i 've seen the @entity6 in airshows up and down the country			1
but this was the closest i 've ever been to them - i could see the pilots quite clearly ' the aerobatics team were practicing low - level flying in the @entity62 hills , and buzzed hill walkers at speeds of up to 500mph mr @entity8 , who said the experience was like having his own personal air show , was just yards from some of the passing aircraft the famous red aircraft snaked around the @entity11 hills - named after the nearby town of @entity43 - before heading back to their base in @entity39 hillwalkers looked on awe - struck as the pilots practiced using their famous red , white and blue vapour trails the @entity6 , officially the @entity6 , performed their first display on may 6 , 1965 at @entity78 , @entity79			1
now numbering nine members – all volunteers – they have appeared at events in more than 50 countries around the world showcasing the skills of @entity7 pilots			0
the planes are painted red for health and safety reasons – red being most visible in the sky – although officially it is in tribute to the @entity94 , their predecessors as an air aerobatic team			0
the @entity6 whose motto is @entity99 , meaning brilliance , have been based at @entity101 in @entity39 since december 21 , 2000			0
three pilots are changed every year , so that there are always three first - year pilots , three second - year pilots , and three in their final year			2
the pilots always fly in the same place in the formation and if one is unwell then they fly in an eight - man formation			2
however , if the lead pilot is unable to fly , then the team 's performance is cancelled			0
in 2010 flt lt @entity114 became the first female @entity6 pilot			0
mr @entity8 's photos are thought to be among the first to show the @entity6 aircraft with their new @entity24 tail colours , which they have had painted on to celebrate their 50th display season unveiling the new design earlier this year , squadron leader @entity120 said : ' we are extremely proud of our heritage and we hope this tailfin design brings with it a sense of pride for both past members of the team and for members of the public to share ' after taking the incredible close - up photos , mr @entity8 said : ' i have explained to friends what it is like but its not you have to be there to get the full thrill			1
i would recommend it to anyone just to experience it once in their life ' the team will put on 85 displays in nine countries during the 2014 display season , which runs from the end of may until the close of september many of the pilots have recent frontline experience with the @entity7 and use skills gained during combat training during the hair - raising routines			1

@entity8 managed to get amazing close - up photos of the display team when he was walking in the @entity62 hills
the incredible photos show the *daredevil* pilots practicing low level training , flying 500mph just 200ft above ground
