the @entity0 and @entity1 have promised to set a date for a long - awaited ' peace conference ' aimed at ending the bloodshed in @entity5 once and for all , secretary of state @entity6 has revealed			1
dubbed ' @entity8 ' , the summit will see top brass from both countries meet to thrash out a solution to the civil war that has raged since march 2011 at a cost of more than 100,000 lives			0
speaking after today 's talks with his @entity1 counterpart @entity16 , mr @entity6 said they planned to meet again on the fringes of the @entity20 in @entity21 later this month to try and set a date for the conference			1
however , the vow comes as rebels claim president @entity26 is simply using the @entity1 to ' buy time ' so he can continue killing with the conventional arsenal he still has at his disposal despite a promise to relinquish his chemical weapons			1
@entity0 officials also claimed one of @entity26 's secretive military units has been moving chemical weapons to as many as 50 different sites over the last few months , just in case @entity0 attack			1
meanwhile , as @entity0 and @entity1 chemical weapons experts huddled in a @entity58 hotel to haggle over technical details that will be critical to reach a deal , mr @entity6 and mr @entity16 met with @entity62 envoy @entity61 to examine political developments and plot a new international conference to support the creation of @entity5 transitional government			1
mr @entity6 , flanked by mr @entity16 and mr @entity61 , told reporters at the @entity20 in @entity58 after an hour - long meeting on the second day of their talks that the chances for a second peace conference in @entity58 ' will obviously depend on the capacity to have success here ... on the subject of the chemical weapons			1
' mr @entity61 also met privately with mr @entity6 at a @entity58 hotel yesterday to explore ways to resume international negotiations last held in @entity58 in june 2012 aimed at ending the @entity5 civil war			2
agreed : dubbed ' @entity8 ' , the summit will see top brass from both countries meet to thrash out a solution to the civil war that has raged since march 2011 at a cost of more than 100,000 lives mr @entity16 said it was ' very unfortunate that for a long time that the @entity58 communique was basically abandoned			0
' mr @entity6 and mr @entity16 announced they would meet again in @entity21 toward the end of the month to try to fix a date for second conference			1
when the talks began yesterday , mr @entity6 bluntly rejected a @entity5 pledge to begin a ' standard process ' by turning over information rather than weapons - and nothing immediately			1
the @entity0 diplomat said that was not acceptable			0
' buying time ' : however , the vow comes as rebels claim president @entity26 is simply using the @entity1 to ' buy time ' so he can continue killing ' the words of the @entity5 regime , in our judgment , are simply not enough , ' mr @entity6 declared as he stood beside mr @entity16			1
' this is not a game			0
' the talks were the latest in a rapidly moving series of events following the august 21 gas attack on suburbs in @entity119			0
the @entity0 blames @entity5 president @entity26 for the use of chemical weapons , although mr @entity26 denies his government was involved and instead points to rebels engaged in a two - year - old civil war against his government			1
president @entity127 began building a case for support at home and abroad for a punitive military strike on mr @entity26 's forces , then changed course and asked @entity134 to give him explicit authority for a limited strike			2
with the prospect that he might lose a vote on action , mr @entity127 said he would consider a @entity1 proposal calling for international control of mr @entity26 's chemical weapons and their eventual destruction			1
mr @entity127 dispatched mr @entity6 to @entity58 to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of @entity0 military action			2
' we believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved , ' mr @entity6 said on the opening day of talks			1
the turnover of weapons must be complete , verifiable and timely , he said , ' and , finally , there ought to be consequences if it does n't take place			2
' mr @entity16 seemed to contradict mr @entity6 's negative view of mr @entity26 's offer to provide details on his country 's chemical arsenal beginning 30 days after it signs an international convention banning such weapons			1
@entity5 's ambassador to the @entity171 said that as of yesterday his country had become a full member of the treaty , which requires destruction of all chemical weapons			2
big decisions : @entity127 ( left ) dispatched mr @entity6 ( right ) to @entity58 to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of @entity0 military action in @entity5 while the diplomacy continues , the conflict rumbles on			2
a @entity5 government solider is pictured in @entity186 village , northeast of the capital @entity119 the @entity1 said the initiative must proceed ' in strict compliance with the rules that are established by the @entity191			2
' that suggests @entity1 does not agree with the @entity0 that this is an exceptional case and that @entity5 should face tougher standards than other countries			2
' we proceed from the fact that the solution to this problem will make unnecessary any strike on the @entity5 , and i am convinced that our @entity0 colleagues , as president @entity127 stated , are firmly convinced that we should follow a peaceful way of resolution to the conflict in @entity5 , ' mr @entity16 said			0
the distrust in @entity0 - @entity1 relations was on display even in an off - hand parting exchange at the news conference			0
just before it ended , mr @entity6 asked the @entity1 translator to repeat part of mr @entity16 's concluding remarks			1
when it was clear that mr @entity6 was n't going to get an immediate retranslation , mr @entity16 apparently tried to assure him that he had n't said anything controversial			0
' it was ok , @entity6 , do n't worry , ' he said			0
' you want me to take your word for it ? ' mr @entity6 asked mr @entity16			0
' it 's a little early for that			0
' they were smiling at that point			0
shortly after making their opening statements , the two went into a private dinner			0
mr @entity26 , in an interview with @entity1 's @entity232 , said his government would start submitting data on its chemical weapons stockpile a month after signing the convention			1
he also said the @entity1 proposal for securing the weapons could work only if the @entity0 halted threats of military action			1
@entity1 president @entity241 said today that @entity5 's efforts have demonstrated its good faith			0
' i would like to voice hope that this will mark a serious step toward the settlement of the @entity5 crisis , ' @entity241 said at a at a meeting in @entity250 of an international security grouping dominated by @entity1 and @entity252			0
even as diplomacy took centre stage , word surfaced that the @entity256 has been delivering light machine guns and other small arms to @entity5 rebels for several weeks , following mr @entity127 's statement in june that he would provide lethal aid to the rebels			0
@entity0 intelligence officials said the @entity256 has arranged for the @entity5 opposition to receive anti-tank weaponry such as rocket - propelled grenades through a third party , presumably one of the @entity270 countries that have been arming the rebels .			0
