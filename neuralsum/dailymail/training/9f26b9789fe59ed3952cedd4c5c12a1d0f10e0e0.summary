a new online test which assesses the chance of developing @entity2 should be taken by everyone over the age of 50 , according to experts			1
the 20 - minute cognitive function test , launched online today , asks simple questions about lifestyle and diet and can calculate a person 's risk of being diagnosed with the brain condition			1
featuring a total of 37 questions , as well as additional interactive memory tests , experts believe the online assessment will help encourage people to change risk factors in their lifestyle and provide vital information about the disease			1
professor @entity30 , who has years of experience in cognitive function , said that as well as acting as a screening programme , the test also provides advice and a personalised health plan			1
he told the @entity44 : ' not only does the test give people positive prevention steps to reduce risk in the long - term but also there 's an annual check - up so people can track how diet and lifestyle changes impact on their cognitive function			1
' he hopes the results of hundreds of thousands of people doing the test will provide vital information to help develop a national prevention strategy			1
the test , available on @entity64 's website , has been launched after a successful pilot in which 200,000 people took part			2
it has also been trialled by experts at @entity72 's @entity71 in @entity73			0
one in four people aged over 50 are predicted to develop @entity2 's at some stage in their life , and approximately 850,000 people in @entity34 are currently affected by the disease , which is the most common form of dementia			1
there are currently no cures for the disease and risk factors are said to include a lack of intellectual stimulating activity , a lack of exercise and a low intake of vegetables and essential vitamins			0
high sugar and fatty diets are said to increase the risk of developing the disease			2
a selection of questions asked in the 20 - minute cognitive function test			1
those taking the test should score 0 - 3 points for answers a-c respectively and add up their scores at the end			0
the lower the score the better one in four people aged over 50 are predicted to develop @entity2 's at some stage in their life			1

older people with memory problems can boost their brainpower with fish oil supplements , say researchers			0
healthy people with mild memory deficits of events in their past life , so - called episodic memory , had improved recall after six months of treatment			0
a new overview says the omega - 3 fatty acid @entity137 has most benefit for people with existing memory problems , particularly when they are coping with physical or mental stress			0
experts believe supplements rich in @entity137 from fish oils or other marine sources might slow or prevent mental decline as it is found in reduced amounts in people with @entity2 ’s disease			0
dr @entity150 , independent public health nutritionist who reviewed the latest evidence for supplements manufacturer @entity152 , said oily fish consumption was falling			0
he said : ' by encouraging people to take positive prevention steps , and tracking their memory function over time , we hope to be able to map the extent to which specific diet and lifestyle improvements stop or delay cognitive decline in hundreds of thousands of people			2
' we want to encourage everyone over 50 to start taking positive prevention steps now rather than wait until it is too late			0
' if people aged 50 start to do a very sensitive memory test every year then they are going to maximise their chances of taking actions that will reduce that risk			1
' the brain starts shrinking from at least the age of 50 so in other words it is not that people suddenly develop @entity2 's in their 80s			2
' what happens is that our brains start shrinking much earlier – it is about a 30 to 40 year process leading up to developing @entity2 dementia			2
' two in five people over 60 already have accelerated brain shrinkage that puts them at very high risk of developing it			0
' we hope the cognitive function test will become part of a national health policy to tackle this preventable disease			2
' the test can be done on any computer or laptop , but not on a mobile or smartphone , and is a screening tool , not a diagnostic test			0
