you have to fear for @entity1 with a hurricane on the way			1
@entity5 ’s defence is about as far from being storm - proofed as it ’s possible to be after spending more than £ 160million on home improvements			0
@entity9 did manage to scramble a point three minutes from time , but twice @entity12 led with a reminder that it will take more than a two - week break , another minor tactical tweak and a bold decision to leave out @entity17 to stop @entity1 springing leaks			1
until they solve such fundamental problems they will remain thrilling to watch but firmly on the outside of the title race			0

subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 goals : @entity59 48 , @entity71 87 booked : blind @entity73 : @entity40 referee : @entity75 @entity77 ’s spirited team had only two efforts on target according to the statistics but they gave their visitors a real scare , as first @entity41 and then @entity44 took advantage of loose defending to beat @entity84			1
@entity1 recovered and will take certain positives from the night , including @entity59 ’s first goal since his £ 27.5m move from @entity88 last year			1
it could be the initial stage of his rehabilitation from figure of fun to cult hero			0
there was also @entity71 ’s first since his transfer from @entity97 in august and , as it came in the closing moments , a return to @entity1 ’s never - say - die traditions			1
and yet , they have not won away from home since april , they have only won three of the first eight @entity32 games and they trail 11 points behind leaders @entity108			0
@entity110 ’s team are at @entity111 on sunday			0
' different cook , as we say in the @entity113 , ' said @entity115 , at @entity116 , to a room full of blank stares			0
' different biscuit ? ' he ventured			0
' different level ? '			0
the @entity113 phrase seems to mean @entity108 will provide a far tougher test of @entity1 ’s progress than anything they have faced to date			2
after @entity108 , it is a derby against @entity128			0
and still @entity115 tinkers , unable to find the right balance			0
at @entity116 , there was a first start of the season for @entity64 as the midfield diamond followed the back - three out of the window and @entity1 adopted a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 shape			1
@entity9 was deployed as the holding midfielder , although he was unable to stop @entity41 sweeping @entity12 into the lead from the area he should have been patrolling			1
@entity41 ’s movement was intelligent , delaying his charge into the penalty area to elude the centre - halves as @entity143 tore forward from right - back			1
@entity57 had been lured in - field to contest a high ball but @entity12 won it and @entity40 released wisdom			1
@entity149 , who performed heroics to protect the lead against @entity88 , on the last outing , had no chance and @entity41 lashed the ball past him from the edge of the box			1
@entity44 curls the ball home to put @entity12 back in front in the second half @entity44 continued his rich vein of form , scoring his fifth goal in his last four games for the @entity12 @entity84 was left with no chance as @entity44 's shot curled past the @entity166 goalkeeper @entity44 celebrates his strike at the @entity116 but @entity12 would be pegged back by @entity1 @entity1 defender @entity54 appears to scream at @entity44 in a desperate last - gasp effort to put him off @entity169 fires in an acrobatic cross for @entity1 as the @entity171 tried to inspire his side at @entity12 @entity12 looked to have earned all three points against @entity1 when @entity44 finished off this fine move in the second half			1

@entity57 seems uncertain when asked to defend in this team , as a far more experienced left - back might			2
@entity56 , @entity1 ’s left - sided centre - half , appeared equally as uncomfortable at times , especially when confronted with the direct and intense elements of @entity185 football			1
@entity12 were quick to launch the ball into @entity56 ’s airspace and to run at @entity57 , too often for it to be a coincidence			2
going forward , of course , @entity1 were mobile , dangerous and kept @entity33 on his toes			2
@entity169 was the greatest threat in the first half but ran out of steam and came off after gesturing as if he might have a problem with his groin			0
@entity33 , deputising for @entity196 who was out with a calf injury , denied stand - in skipper @entity198 within and then again to frustrate @entity60 twice , in the first half			0
@entity12 scrambled around to protect their goal			2
they defended stoutly , throwing bodies in front of shots , but were helped by wayward finishing , which had @entity1 ’s chief executive @entity205 grumbling in the vip seats			2
@entity41 's shot heads for the top corner to put @entity12 in front against @entity1 @entity84 was left stranded as @entity41 's drive gave the home side the lead at the @entity116 @entity41 celebrates his opening goal for @entity12 , the first time he has scored this season @entity59 warmed up at half time before the @entity216 midfielder was introduced with devastating effect @entity59 controlled the ball expertly before firing it past @entity33 in the @entity12 goal in the second half @entity59 's hair appears to glow as he peels away from @entity198 to take the plaudits of the fans @entity59 leads the celebrations after hauling @entity1 level immediately after the break at the @entity116 @entity59 is joined by his team - mates @entity63 and @entity64 as @entity1 celebrate their equaliser @entity115 replaced @entity58 with @entity59 at half - time and his team were soon level			1
@entity59 levelled when he took a deep cross from @entity60 on his chest , held off @entity36 and lashed the ball high past @entity33 with his left foot			2
@entity1 pressed on for the winner			0
the introduction of @entity59 was not the only change @entity115 made at half - time			1
his team pressed further up the field after the break , which seemed to help , but encouraged @entity12 on the break and they went ahead when @entity43 unzipped the defence with a pass in the 65th minute			2
@entity44 collected it and the 20 - year - old made no mistake , with a lethal finish to celebrate his seventh of the season in all competitions			1
@entity252 risked throwing everything forward			0
@entity63 smacked the foot of the post and @entity37 escaped with a clear handball inside his own penalty area			0
@entity12 ’s luck ran out as @entity71 salvaged a point , seizing on a partial clearance as it rolled out of the penalty area and guided it coolly inside the post			2
heartbreak for @entity12 but @entity1 , however dreadful at the back , probably deserved their point for their adventure			1
different biscuit ? it ’s the way the cookie crumbles			0
@entity64 was sporting some sheer white boots as the @entity216 started for @entity1 against @entity12 @entity1 manager @entity5 ca n't look as his side fall behind for a second time against @entity12 @entity67 puts his hands over his face as @entity44 fired @entity12 back into the lead the inquest into @entity1 's defending begins as @entity56 ( left ) is left dejected by @entity12 's second goal @entity17 was sent on by @entity115 in the second half in an attempt to rescue something for @entity1 @entity63 came agonisingly close to equalising but his volley crashed back off the post @entity1 defender @entity55 pulls a face as he challenges @entity44 during the draw at the @entity116 @entity60 again failed to last the full 90 minutes as the @entity171 winger was replaced by @entity61 in the second half			1

@entity1 rescued a point thanks to @entity9 's goal three minutes from full time
@entity41 had fired @entity12 in front after eight minutes with a *stunning* strike
@entity1 hit back through @entity59 three minutes after the break with an equally well - hit effort
@entity44 *restored* the @entity12 ' lead with a composed finish but his side could not hang on
