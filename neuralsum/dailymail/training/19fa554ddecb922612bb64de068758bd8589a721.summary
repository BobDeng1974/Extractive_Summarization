by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin if the adornments to @entity4 ’s left wrist have been causing flutters at the @entity6 , it was the stuff propelled by his right one that briefly did for the @entity9 in @entity10 on tuesday			1
while the world of cricket was having its say on the rights and wrongs of the ‘ @entity18 ’ and ‘ @entity19 ’ wristbands worn by @entity4 on monday , the man himself was busy profiting from the tourists ’ apparent urge to self - destruct on the third afternoon of this south coast slow - burner			1
@entity4 is very much @entity25 ’s fifth bowler , an off - spinner so tantalisingly poised between frontline and part - time that @entity29 does n’t seem sure how to handle him			1
to judge by events either side of tea , the confusion had spread to @entity35 ’s middle order			0
hands free ! @entity4 got over his wrist bands controversy to chip in with two wickets at the @entity39 slap on the wrist ! the @entity6 has banned @entity4 from wearing @entity42 wristbands while playing for @entity25 in the penultimate over before the break , the supremely gifted @entity43 took leave of his senses — as he has been known to in the past — and drove @entity4 straight to @entity49 at mid-off			1
then , in the third over after tea , @entity51 spoiled the effect of a gutsy half - century by top - edging an inviting long hop straight to midwicket			2
from 210 for four , @entity35 — a nation that traditionally produces some of the world ’s best players of spin — were 217 for six , still 359 behind			2
@entity4 ’s brief @entity25 career has already raised the possibility of an identity crisis			1
is he the master of self - denial who almost saved a test by himself against @entity67 , or the flighty no 6 with an issue against the short ball ? and are his off - breaks designed to hold up an end — or take wickets ? some of the names among his 12 test victims so far suggest the part - time tag is too hastily applied			0
he has removed @entity67 ’s @entity76 twice , plus five of @entity35 ’s top eight on show in this @entity66			0
as for chips to mid-off and miscued half - trackers , did n’t @entity79 take the occasional wicket with a bad ball ? ‘ he picked up a couple of freakish wickets , ’ said @entity49			2
‘ but that was off the pressure he developed			0
and he was unlucky not to have @entity51 caught down the leg side			0
hopefully the wicket will deteriorate in the second innings , and @entity4 could be a bit of a handful			0
self destruct mode : @entity43 shows his frustration after losing a ' freak wicket ' against @entity4 high five : @entity4 celebrates after @entity35 batsman @entity43 is caught out by @entity49 ‘ we ’ve been so fortunate having @entity98 play over 60 tests for us			1
when you ’re playing with him , perhaps you do n’t realise what role he played			0
but @entity4 ’s developing every game as a spin bowler			1
’ @entity25 will miss @entity98 for a while yet , and @entity4 ’s misfortune has been to invite unfair comparisons with his country ’s greatest modern off - spinner			1
but @entity98 would have settled for @entity4 ’s spell either side of tea of 12 - 0 - 33 - 2			2
the jury may be out on @entity4 ’s batting , if only because he keeps getting in a tangle against the bouncer			0
but his off - breaks are getting into a groove			0
and if that means the odd lucky break , @entity98 would definitely approve			0
practice makes perfect : @entity4 is developing as a spin bowler in every games , says @entity49			1

@entity25 *restricted* @entity35 to *328* - 8 on day three of the @entity124
@entity4 took ' freak wickets ' from @entity43 and @entity51
@entity6 banned @entity4 from wearing ' @entity18 ' and ' free @entity129 ' wristbands
@entity49 *insists* the spin bowler is getting better with every game
