@entity0 will face a steep run chase to stay alive in their @entity3 series with @entity4 after the hosts piled on the runs in @entity7			1
after conceding a first - innings deficit of 65 , @entity0 were unable to rip through @entity4 's batting order second time around and the @entity10 closed day four on 261 for seven , a lead of 326			1
even that could prove to be beyond an @entity16 side which has folded under pressure already on this tour and , if that proves to be the case again , the series - which they trail 2 - 0 with one @entity3 left - will be gone			0
@entity20 fired 69 for @entity4 as the hosts asserted their dominance over @entity0 in the third test @entity24 also made a useful 62 and finished unbeaten at the end of day four in @entity7 @entity20 and @entity24 kept them at bay on monday , scoring 69 and 62 not out respectively , and if the latter adds some quick runs on tuesday , @entity0 could end up chasing closer to 400			1
resuming themselves on 462 for eight , they did not hang around long before being all out , @entity30 taking the quick wickets of @entity34 and @entity35			0
@entity4 's lead gave them some comfort but , considering the way @entity41 and @entity42 batted first time out for @entity0 , they knew they needed to amass a more sizeable advantage			1
@entity46 and @entity20 set about doing that , the former making 40 before he went leg before to @entity49			0
@entity50 went in and added 17 until he nicked @entity51 behind , while captain @entity52 - with three hundreds in a row - made just 14			0
@entity51 ( second left ) celebrates with his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity55 ( second right ) off - break bowler @entity49 ( centre ) dismissed opening batsman @entity46 for lbw for 40 @entity20 continued along and got his 50 off 81 balls but when he went leg before to @entity49 , and debutant @entity55 followed for nine , @entity4 were teetering on 176 for five and with a lead of 241			2
@entity24 was at hand and started to tick over , although @entity62 failed to stick with him , @entity35 having him taken behind for 13			0
but @entity30 hung around for 15 and when he went to @entity64 , @entity63 made an unbeaten eight to give @entity24 company as he looked to build on his 112 - ball half - century .			2
