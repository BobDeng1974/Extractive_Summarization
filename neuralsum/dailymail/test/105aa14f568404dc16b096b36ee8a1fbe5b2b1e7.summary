our young @entity0 may have collided with a body similar to the planet @entity4 , says a new paper			1
the dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field			0
and it could also explain why certain rare - earth elements in @entity0 ’s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet ’s other building blocks - meteorites			1
@entity17 scientists say a @entity4 - like body struck the young @entity0 ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
the object would have been the heat source for our planet 's core			1
the same object could have been responsible for creating the moon			2
it also explains where some rare - @entity0 elements came from the study , by two scientists from the @entity17 , was published in the journal @entity34			1
our current theory of @entity0 ’s formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body			2
however , this model can not explain where the heat source for @entity0 ’s core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from			1
in addition , @entity0 ’s crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare - earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in @entity0 ’s formation than first thought			1
to address this discrepancy , scientists believe that @entity0 was hit by a body that was the size of @entity58 - but like @entity4 in its composition - early in its life			1
this likely would have happened about 4.5 billion years ago			0
the body would have been rich in sulphur but very poor in oxygen - just like @entity4			2
many researchers believe the moon formed after @entity0 was hit by a planet the size of @entity58 billions of years ago			1
this is called the giant impact hypothesis			0
the hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago			0
the colliding body is sometimes called @entity78 , after the mythical @entity79 who was the mother of @entity81 , the goddess of the @entity82			0
but one mystery has persisted , revealed by rocks the @entity86 astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and @entity0 so similar in their composition ? several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of @entity0 and the moon			2
perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the @entity0 and then later condensed to form the moon			0
or @entity78 could have , coincidentally , been isotopically similar to young @entity0			2
a third possibility is that the moon formed from @entity95 materials , rather than from @entity78 , although this would have been a very unusual type of impact			0
our current theory of @entity0 ’s ( left ) formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body			0
now scientists think that @entity0 was hit by a body that was the size of @entity58 , but like @entity4 ( right ) in its composition , early in its life			1
in the young solar system 4.5 billion years ago , illustrated , various planetesimals and other small bodies coalesced together to form larger bodies like @entity0 as it collided with @entity0 , it would have produced radioactive uranium and thorium , generating the heat needed to drive the ‘ dynamo ’ of molten iron in @entity0 ’s core			2
and they do not rule out the possibility that this is the same @entity58 - sized body that formed the moon			1
‘ we think that that is quite conceivable , ’ said study co-author @entity123 , reported the @entity124			0
‘ it 's kind of exciting to think that this reduced body could actually be the thing which caused the moon			0
’ in an accompanying @entity131 article for @entity34 , dr @entity132 of the @entity133 in @entity129 said the theory could open up new avenues for thought			0
. for example , if true , it would raise further questions about ‘ how @entity0 ended up in its present oxidised state , which it has apparently retained for more than three billion years			0

@entity17 scientists say a @entity4 - like body struck the young @entity0
the @entity58 - sized object would have been the heat source for our planet
the same object could have been responsible for creating the moon
it also explains where some rare - @entity0 elements came from
