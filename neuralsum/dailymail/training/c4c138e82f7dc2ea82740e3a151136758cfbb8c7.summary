although the @entity5 says the problem is now fixed , there are fears that thousands of people may have already had their computers infected by viruses , potentially compromising their personal information			1
the problems were first spotted over the weekend , with thousands of users subsequently taking to social networks to complain about malware - infested pages and links to irrelevant advertisements			1
writing on @entity27 , a user going by the name @entity25 wrote : ' while attempting to access flu shot information i stumbled on a page which redirected me to an advert			0
digging a bit deeper i found hundreds more pages which redirect either to an advert or to malware - infested pages			0
' in total around 800 pages are believed to have been affected , although site administrators insist the problem was not caused by hackers			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity42 , which runs the @entity5 website , said the problems were caused by a misplaced letter 's ' at the coding stage , with a developer accidentally typing googleaspis.com instead or googleapis.com			1
the spelling error initially had little or no effect for visitors to the @entity5 website , but on sunday the incorrect web address was registered as a new website in the @entity54			1
patients were then redirected to the @entity54 version of the website , which had been loaded with adverts and malware			2
internet security expert @entity60 said the @entity5 ' explanation was unusual but added that if it turned out to be factually accurate , then anybody who inadvertently downloaded malware could be at risk speaking to the @entity66 , internet security expert @entity60 said the explanation was unusual but added that if it turned out to be factually accurate , then anybody who inadvertently downloaded malware could be at risk			2
mr @entity60 said : ' i 'm surprised by that explanation ... what often happens is that a hacker will find a weak point and inject a piece of code to exploit it and set up a domain name			0
otherwise whoever registered the domain name in the @entity54 must have scanned the code , which few do , or registered numerous websites in the hope of getting lucky			0
' in a statement the @entity42 said : ' an internal coding error has caused an incorrect redirect on some pages on @entity5 since sunday evening			1
routine security checks alerted us to the problem on monday morning at which point we identified the problem and corrected the code			0
' the statement added : ' @entity5 has conducted an investigation of the adverts that some users were taken to and found nothing malicious			2

coding - error redirects thousands of @entity5 users to a *fraudulent* website
patients were bombarded with irrelevant advertisements and malware
fears *raised* that thousands may have had personal details compromised
