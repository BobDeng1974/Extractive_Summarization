but when sir @entity6 released his latest album , it was no match for the @entity9 ’s chart - topping efforts			1
instead , the former @entity11 ’s latest offering charted at number 18 in the @entity15 @entity14 chart yesterday , behind controversial singer @entity16 , @entity18 singer songwriter @entity17 and pop band @entity19			0
sir @entity6 has engaged in months of publicity to push the album , which was produced by @entity23 despite months of publicity and interviews from the veteran rocker , @entity27 , his first album to feature original songs since 2007 , did n’t reach the top ten in the digital downloads chart – the biggest retailer of music			1
it is in stark contrast to fellow musician @entity4 , whose comeback album immediately peaked at number one in the @entity14 chart within hours of its release in march this year			2
it was his first material in ten years and went on to top the charts in 60 countries around the world			0
sir @entity6 , 71 , has engaged in months of publicity to push the album , which was produced by @entity23 , known for his work with @entity47 , @entity48 , the son of legendary @entity49 producer @entity49 , and @entity50 , whose father is former @entity11 producer sir @entity52			1
@entity6 ( top left ) posing for photographs with his former band , the @entity11 however , it appears as though the constant promotional work undertaken by @entity6 has succeeded in one respect ; a compilation album of @entity58 , 1 , has re-entered the @entity60 @entity14 chart , and by last night had made it to number 69			1
describing the album , the 16th of his solo career , @entity6 has stated that the record was inspired by events including his marriage to @entity67 as well as his early days as a musician before he found fame with the @entity11			2
the album has been widely praised by critics , one of whom described the title track as a ‘ jaunty , beatles-esque stomp ’ and likening it to @entity11 hit ‘ @entity77 ’			1
by this evening , the album had slipped to number 21 in the @entity15 @entity14 chart , but the position of albums and singles can change from hour to hour depending on sales			0
the @entity83 , which provides the charts based on the number of physical copies sold , will be announced on sunday			0
sir @entity6 ’s last album , @entity88 , featuring covers of classic pop songs , entered the @entity15 charts at number 3 when it was released last year			2
his previous album , @entity93 peaked at number 5 when it was released in 2007 .			0
