it is thought he was given the nickname due to his @entity2 accent now the drummer has spoken out saying that it is ' b * * * * * * t ' that they have these names as it goes against @entity4 ' ideology of peace and love			1
mr @entity0 told the @entity45 : ' what they are doing out there is against everything @entity4 stood for			1
' if we stood for anything we never stood for that			0
the four of us absolutely stood for peace and love			2

the former insurgent , in his 20s and now based in @entity97 , said @entity20 helped to showcase @entity5 to @entity99 recruits			0
he said : ' it is possible that the goal was to project the image that a @entity103 or a @entity99 person executed an @entity18 so that they can showcase their @entity99 members and appeal to others outside @entity3 and make them feel that they belong to the same cause and that they too can do anything in support of @entity5 in their respective countries			0
