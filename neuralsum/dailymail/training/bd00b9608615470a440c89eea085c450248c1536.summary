lampooning @entity1 's perceived prejudices , it also refers to @entity46 people as cheese - eating , beret - wearing frogs and people in @entity50 as ' cosmopolitan poofters ' - foreshadowing the use of the homophobic word this week by @entity1 candidate @entity54			1
at the time mr @entity10 told the mirror : ' i love @entity43 's cartoons and i thought it was a brilliant bit of satire lampooning @entity1			1

' mr @entity10 , who hopes to stand for the @entity11 constituency at next may 's election , was due to speak at the school on thursday			1

we 've got members of @entity83 , members of @entity83 , we 've got councillors across the @entity86			0
' this is an affront to democracy			2

it 's important that people see there is a choice : extremism and hate from @entity1 and hope and the future from us			2

@entity42 told @entity143 : ' i thought it was to his credit that he could laugh at himself			0
' i think in a way it 's best for all of us to hear what people are thinking			0
the moment we start censoring each other it makes it much trickier and drives it all underground			0
