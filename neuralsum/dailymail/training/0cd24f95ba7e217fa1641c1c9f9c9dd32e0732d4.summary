by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 31 march 2013 let down : @entity1 , 71 , believes if he had been diagnosed sooner he may not have lost sight in his right eye a grandfather has been left blind in one eye after medics missed four opportunities to diagnose a treatable disease			1
@entity1 , 71 , from @entity10 , visited an optician , a gp and four separate hospitals before he was finally treated for wet age - related macular degeneration ( @entity15 )			1
the condition is the most common cause of blindness in the @entity19 affecting around 500,00 people			1
but by then he was told the disease was so far advanced nothing could be done and he has permanently lost vision in his right eye			0
the ordeal began when mr @entity1 , a retired @entity25 driver , started experiencing eyesight problems two years ago and booked an appointment at a boots opticians			1
he was told he probably had ' astigmatism ' a common eye defect			1
but months later he felt the situation had got worse and went to see his gp			0
he was referred to @entity33 but had to wait around three weeks for an appointment			0
' coloured objects in my right eye seemed faded and there was a slight tinge to straight lines			0
the @entity12 sent me to @entity33 and i had drops put in my eye and dye in the vein and it was then that i heard him say it could be something to do with the macular , ' said mr @entity1			1
the father - of - three was given a ' vague ' diagnosis of @entity15 but was not given any treatment			1
instead he was sent to @entity51 because ' they had better equipment '			1
but again this took several weeks and the same tests were repeated			0
' when i finally had the appointment the nurse seemed quite shocked and taken a back by how much the sight in my right eye had deteriorated between coming to them and being initially seen at @entity10 , ' said mr @entity1			1
he was then transferred to a third hospital - @entity61 in @entity62			1
' there was no fast tracking me to get an appointment there either and when i did finally see someone they looked at my right eye and told me there was nothing they could do for me and i was basically told to go away , ' he added			2
but by this point there was nothing that could be done as his macular had deteriorated so badly			0
' they said " sorry , you 're too late , we ca n't do anything for you			0
" i feel strongly that i should have been fast tracked and that i should have been sent to the right hospital straight away , ' he said			2
' i feel like i 've been really let down by the system			1
there was no sense of urgency in any of this			0
i just got pushed from hospital to hospital and because of the delays i 've now lost the central vision in my right eye for good			2
' i should have been treated better than this			0
they knew how rapidly i could lose my sight by there was delay after delay , ' he added			0
mr @entity1 now has to rely heavily on his left eye and fears that his partial blindness will stop him enjoying his hobby of riding vintage motorbikes			1
' if i 'd known back then what i know now , i would have been shouting from the roof tops demanding treatment right from the start			0
this ca n't continue to happen to other people , ' he said			0
@entity10 and @entity117 said it was unable to comment on an individual case			2
a spokesman for @entity121 said : ' if mr @entity1 needs to raise any issues about the care he received , he should contact our customer care team and we would be happy to discuss this further with him			2
' boots opticians failed to respond to a request for comment			0
warning : @entity15 develops in people as they get older , espcially over 65s			2
