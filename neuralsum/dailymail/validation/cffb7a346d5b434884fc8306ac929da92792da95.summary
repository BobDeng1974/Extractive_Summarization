married couples could get a bigger cut in income tax after the election , @entity0 has signalled as he admitted he must do more to win back disgruntled @entity5			1
the prime minister said he wanted to ' expand ' the marriage tax allowance , which begins next month and is worth £ 212 - a - year for some couples			1
he said some of his natural supporters had ' drifted ' to other parties , as he vowed to stick to his promise to cut net migration to the ' tens of thousands ' , despite the number soaring to almost 300,000			1
the £ 1,060 transferable tax allowance will particularly benefit couples where one parent does not work or only works part - time			1
however , if both people in a couple earn more than £ 10,600 they will not qualify and higher rate taxpayers earning more than £ 42,385 a year are also excluded			1
the idea was first promised by mr @entity0 when he ran for the @entity18 leadership in 2005 , and marks the first recognition of marriage in the tax system since the married couples ' allowance was phased out in 1999			2
it will apply to spouses who do not use all of their personal allowance – either because they are at home looking after children , or work part - time and earn less than the threshold for income tax , £ 10,600 in april			1
they will now be able to transfer up to £ 1,060 of their unused personal tax - free allowance to a spouse or civil partner , as long as the recipient of the transfer pays the basic rate of income tax , levied on income up to £ 42,385			1
that will save the couple up to £ 212 a year on their tax bill			1
at the @entity18 spring forum yesterday , mr @entity0 was heckled by party member @entity59 who said the pm had ' betrayed this country on @entity62 and immigration ' the @entity18 will spend an extra gbp8 billion on the @entity65 if it wins the general election to fund a five year plan drawn up by its chief executive , @entity64 has promised			1
the health secretary said the government would fully fund the plan drawn up by @entity73 boss @entity72 , which would see £ 2billion being pumped into the health service every year until 2019 - 20			1
the so - called ' @entity72 plan ' will see a total of £ 30 billion put into the @entity65 , with £ 22 billion found through efficiency savings and £ 8 billion in extra spending			1
until now only the @entity80 had pledged to find the money but mr @entity64 has signed the @entity5 up to the plan			2
asked by the @entity83 if the @entity5 would find the full £ 30billion , mr @entity64 said : ' yes			1
we 've demonstrated that we 're as good as our word			0
' at the last election we were the only party that promised to protect the @entity65 budget			2
we did n't just protect it , we increased it			2
' we said to @entity72 , ' how much do you need for your plan next year , the first year of your five - year plan ? ' he said ' £ 1.7billion ' , and we actually found him £ 2billion			1
' we 're now doing the work as to what the efficiency savings are			0
the gap might be more than £ 8bn , it might be less			2
' that will all be settled in the summer when we do the spending - round discussions			2
we will continue to spend more in real terms year in , year out			2
' however , the idea was mocked by @entity80 deputy prime minister @entity104 who said the state should not lecture people on their private lives			1
' we should not take a particular version of the family institution , such as the 1950s model of suit - wearing , bread - winning dad and aproned , home - making mother - and try and preserve it in aspic , ' mr @entity104 said in 2011			0
' that 's why open society liberals and big society conservatives will take a different view on a tax break for marriage			0
' however , mr @entity0 has signalled that if he is returned to power he wants to increase the amount that married couples could save on their tax bills			0
he told the @entity126 : ' i am very proud to have kept my commitment to introduce the married couples ' tax allowance			0
i think it will prove very popular			0
' i think it 's absolutely right that we recognise marriage in the tax system properly and i would like to see that expanded			0
' mr @entity0 suggested that it was part of attempts to win back traditional @entity18 voters who have switched to other parties , including @entity141 and @entity142			2
' i accept i have a task in the next 41 days to win back people who are instinctively conservative , who have strong conservative values and some of them have drifted off to other parties			1
i need to win them back			0
' at the @entity18 spring forum yesterday , mr @entity0 was heckled by party member @entity59 who said the pm had ' betrayed this country on @entity62 and immigration '			0
mr @entity0 has come under fire after promising ' no ifs , no buts ' to cut net migration to below 100,000			1
but latest figures released last week show that a total of 298,000 more people arrived in @entity160 than left in the year to september , as the numbers arriving from the rest of the @entity163 hit a record high			0
a record 624,000 arrived in @entity160 in a year , up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months			0
at the same time , 327,000 left , a figure which has barely changed since 2010			0
net long - term migration to the @entity160 was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier some senior @entity5 urged mr @entity0 to ditch the pledge , but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too			1
he said : ' @entity160 is facing quite a lot of pressure because the level of migration has been too high for too long			0
you see that on school places , and you see that in some places on the health service			0
' i can absolutely say to people who are concerned about this , ' i hear you , i hear your concern , i get your message			0
he insisted he sticks to his pledge : ' you can call it an ambition , you can call it a target			0
that is what i want to achieve			0
