by @entity0 published : 02:41 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 03:46 est , 31 july 2013 a leading surgeon faces being struck off after he conned a wealthy widow out of hundreds of thousands of pounds by persuading her to ' invest ' money into joint bank accounts and funding his children 's school fees			1
dr @entity7 , a leading colonic specialist based at the @entity8 and @entity9 , befriended @entity10 after her husband @entity11 died , leaving her a £ 1.4m estate			1
the father - of - three persuaded her to buy property , land and ' invest ' money in joint bank accounts between 2003 and 2006 , the @entity13 has heard			1
dr @entity7 is accused of conning wealthy widow @entity10 ( right ) , out of hundreds of thousands of pounds and funding his lifestyle with the money dr @entity19 also suggested she transfer large sums of cash into foreign bank accounts then misappropriated the funds for his own gain			1
mrs @entity27 's financial position diminished ' in direct proportion ' to the doctor 's own wealth increasing , the hearing was told			1
she paid for him to go on a £ 5,000 holiday to @entity36 in 2003 , during which the pair developed a sexual relationship , the panel heard			2
he also used funds to pay airlines , his racquet club , dentist 's bills , his children 's school fees and to buy cars			1
the panel found his actions were dishonest and likely to bring the medical profession into disrepute and he could now be forced out of the profession			0
' the panel is satisfied that you dishonesty misappropriated @entity60 's @entity58 's money and property , ' said panel chair @entity61			2
the leading colonic specialist , based at the @entity8 and @entity9 , denies the allegations and said they never had a close relationship ' the panel is also satisfied that you utilised mrs a 's financial resources for your own benefit and to the detriment of @entity74 ' it considered that your actions were dishonest and , as such , in breach of a fundamental tenet of the medical profession			1
' that being so , your actions had the very real potential to bring the medical profession into disrepute			0
' dr @entity7 became close to the widow after the death of her 84 - year - old husband in 2001			1
they were living in the same exclusive apartment block in @entity90 when the grieving widow , who was herself in ill health , turned to the medic for guidance			2
the friendship blossomed and by the end of 2002 the pair regularly socialised and dined out together			0
after the decision yesterday @entity99 , for the @entity100 told the panel : ' the doctor was fully aware that mrs a invested in him that degree of trust and was seeking his assistance to identify both security and safety			2
' one symptom of the pattern of behaviour the doctor cultivated was repeatedly and consistently choosing his own interests and aspirations and relegating those of mrs a , ' he added			2
' the pair opened a joint @entity116 account for ' business investments ' into which mrs @entity118 transferred around £ 779,000 between 2003 and 2006 ' ' the doctor utilised funds and financial resources as his own , not seeking or gaining her consent for their use			1
' mr @entity99 continued : ' he caused mrs a to incur significant cost in time , effort and emotional commitment simply to lay claim to that which she was entitled			2
' dr @entity7 denied all the allegations against him and , giving evidence , told the panel he never had a close relationship with mrs @entity27			1
' according to the doctor he was the person who was abused			0
he classified the whole relationship as bizarre			2
' he sought to persuade you that mrs a was a colleague , that she was a business associate , that he did n't at any time consider her financial security and he did n't think there was any responsibility on him to protect mrs a from herself , ' said mr @entity99			2
' having seen the opportunity the doctor lost no time in seeking to cultivate it and thereafter harvested the opportunities @entity58 represented under the guise of a close relationship			1
' in january 2003 dr @entity7 persuaded mrs @entity27 to buy his flat in an exclusive block in @entity90 for £ 429,000 , though it was only valued at £ 375,000			1
despite her transferring sums of £ 134,000 £ 80,000 and £ 215,000 for the purchase of the property between february and september , dr @entity7 retained joint ownership			1
he later claimed the sums were transferred as gifts for his children or that he considered them as a loan			0
when she transferred the sum of £ 215,000 he said he was ' beside himself and horrified ' and thought the behaviour was ' bizarre '			0
but he used the funds to put towards the purchase of a new family home in @entity167 , @entity168			0
later that year the pair opened a joint @entity116 account for ' business investments ' into which mrs @entity118 transferred around £ 779,000 between 2003 and 2006			2
the panel found dr @entity7 withdrew around £ 70k for his personal use			1
dr @entity7 and mrs @entity174 also opened a joint @entity177 dollar account for currency trading in 2004 and the widow transferred large sums of money to foreign accounts on the doctor 's request			1
she transferred a total of $ 645,645 including a sum of $ 440k to buy land in @entity188 , which was never bought			1
on one occasion he told her his brother was in ' serious ' financial trouble and asked her to transfer $ 20,000 because the @entity188 mafia would be ' after ' him if the money was not paid			0
when mrs @entity27 sought recompense , first at the high court before reporting the medic to the @entity100 , dr @entity7 branded her as ' the enemy ' , the hearing was told			1
' mrs a became the enemy and as the enemy he was able to concoct lies and further statements to her which were dishonest , ' said mr @entity99			0
' we say the conduct was sustained , it was deliberate and it was targeted			0
there has been no expression of regret , nor any apology			0
' even now the doctor closes his eyes to his actions and the consequences that have befallen mrs a as a result of them , ' he added			0
' you have found the doctor has been guilty of material acts of dishonesty			0
those acts of themselves and collectively are a course of conduct that represents a significant and fundamental departure from good medical practice , ' mr @entity99 told the panel			0
the panel must now decide if the doctor 's actions amount to misconduct and if his fitness to practise is impaired as a result			0
if so he could be forced to work under conditions , face suspension or struck off the medical register			0
the doctor is not attending this stage of the hearing , which resumed yesterday for the third time after starting last year			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
