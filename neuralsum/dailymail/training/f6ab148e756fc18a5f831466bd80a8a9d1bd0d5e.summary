@entity0 launched the service last week , allowing users to send @entity2 message in advance , to be delivered to friends at midnight @entity30 student @entity29 revealed the privacy flaw on @entity0 's @entity32 features on his blog early this morning			1
' @entity0 have not been very security conscious when setting this up , ' he wrote			1
' by simple manipulation of the @entity38 at the end of the url of a sent message on the @entity42 site , you are able to view other peoples @entity45 messages			1
' by experimenting with the flaw , mr @entity29 said he was even able to see pictures sent by people			0
' it is you may say a pretty harmless flaw , as they tend to be generic messages and you ca n’t see who sent them ( it shows your profile pic next to the message , as if you ’ve sent it ) , ' he said			2
the site was instead showing an error message today as the firm disabled the feature ' however you can see the names of the recipients of the message			0
' some messages do contain a photo , one such message i saw contained a photo of a father and their child , another a family photo , another was a personally written message with a photo			0
' a @entity0 spokeswoman early this morning confirmed that it was aware of the issue and was working on a fix			2
' in the interim we have disabled this app on the @entity85 site to ensure that no messages can be accessed			0
