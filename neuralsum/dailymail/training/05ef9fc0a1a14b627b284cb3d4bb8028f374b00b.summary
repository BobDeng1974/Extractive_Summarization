in times of famine , some animals go to desperate measures to stay alive , including eating members of their own species			1
now scientists have captured one of the first cases of cannibalism in hippopotamuses on camera			1

scientists have captured one of the first cases of cannibalism in hippopotamuses on camera			1
the grisly photographs ( one pictured ) show a hippo eating a corpse of another floating in a river in @entity19 ’s @entity18			1
they are not sure why the act occured they were taken by biologist @entity31 while on safari last year			1
he told @entity33 : ‘ i was completely amazed			2
it was something i had never heard of			2
’ having returned to @entity37 , the phd student discovered that cannibalism in hippos has only been described once before , in 1999			1
while hippos are herbivores , other scientists have seen them deviate from their diet of grasses and the occasional aquatic plant to feast on impala - a medium - sized antelope			2
the other instance of hippo cannibalism occurred during a severe drought			1
dr @entity50 , a biologist at the @entity51 , @entity52 , explained that cannibalism is one way for creatures to get all the nutrients they need in one convenient package			1
when mr @entity31 recorded the act of cannibalism , he noticed that the region had lush grass ( seen in this image ) which makes up the bulk of a hippo 's diet			1
the only other record of cannibalism in the species was seen in the midst of a severe drought hippos leave water at dusk to travel up to six miles ( 10km ) inland to graze on grasses			1
they spend almost all the rest of the time in rivers and lakes			2
grass is their main source of food , and they consume around 150lbs ( 68kg ) of it every night , over around five hours			2
they occasionally eat aquatic plants			0
there have been reports of hippos eating impala and carrion but their stomachs are not suited to a meaty diet and meat eating is thought to be driven by drought and desperation			1
hippos are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mothers ' faeces to digest vegetation			0
for example , mormon crickets migrate on mass during food shortages and if one stops marching , others will devour it , because their fellow katydid is a good source of protein and salt , needed by the insects			0
however , animals that feast on their own species run the risk of catching a disease			2
most animals usually only resort to eating their own species during times of extreme hardship , when the risk of catching a disease is less then starving to death			2
@entity126 , for example , are known to eat their young when there is no other food available and sometimes scavenge corpses			0
however , when mr @entity31 recorded the act of cannibalism , he noticed that the region had lush grass			2
the event was documented in the @entity136			0
to solve the mystery of why the hippo ate the corpse , he wants to document other cases of cannibalism in the species in @entity19			1
‘ because the behaviour is so rare , we are relying on others to report it , ’ he said			0
while hippos are herbivores , other scientists have seen them deviate from their diet of grasses and the occasional aquatic plant to feast on impala – a medium - sized antelope ( stock image shown ) desperation : in times of famine , some animals go to desperate measures to stay alive , including eating members of their own species			1
for example , crocodiles have been known to eat their offspring when no other food is available			0
nutrition : mormon crickets migrate on mass during food shortages and if one stops marching , others will devour it , because their fellow katydid is a good source of protein and salt , needed by the insects			0
cannibalism is a convenient way to get all the nutrients an animal needs , but they run the risk of more easily catching diseases			1
female rattlesnakes eat stillborn or non-viable offspring to recover some of their strength , @entity185 reported			0
mormon crickets ( stock image ) migrate on mass during food shortages and if one stops marching , others will devour it , because their fellow katydid is a good source of protein and salt , needed by the insects crab spiders eat eggs and their mother over the course of weeks until she is immobile and dies , @entity197 reported , allowing offspring to be heavier and to have a better chance at survival			0
stress : stressed screech owls have been known to eat a mate when adapting to a new environment , although the behaviour is rare			0
sand sharks ( stock image ) eat their younger siblings while still in the womb to give themselves the best chance of survival sex : male @entity218 redback spiders are often eaten by females during copulation			0
while the male perishes , the copulation time is extended , increasing his chance of passing on his genes			0
the act is n't unusual in spiders and some insects such as the praying mantis			0
survival of infants : in what is perhaps the ultimate competition for food , sand sharks eat their younger siblings while still in the womb to give themselves the best chance of survival			0
@entity238 salamanders come in two larval forms - normal and cannibalistic			0
the cannibals develop faster and have wider jaws and sharper teeth to chomp on their siblings			0
dominance and competition : male lions sometimes kill a younger lion that is challenging leadership of the pride			0
if the young imposter wins , he may kill cubs to make room for his own offspring			0
in 1977 , famous conservationist @entity255 reported cannibalism in male and chimpanzees			2
it was presumed for years that the act was unusual , but in 2007 , experts came to the conclusion that it was a behaviour designed to cut competition for food and mates , after seeing gentler female chimps eating others			1
mystery : sometimes experts have no idea why one animal eats another			1
keepers at @entity273 ’s @entity272 in @entity274 saw a mother sloth bear eating one of her own cubs			1
the mother , named @entity279 , had raised offspring before , leaving experts baffled as to what prompted her to eat the small bear .			2

grisly photographs show a hippo eating a corpse of another floating in a river in @entity19 ’s @entity18
experts are *unsure* what motivated the animal to feast on one of its own
only instance of hippo cannibalism described before was in drought
biologist hopes to unravel mystery by *collecting* further reports
