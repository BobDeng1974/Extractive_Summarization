by @entity0 smiling widely as he bounces a child on his knee @entity4 poses during a photo call as it is revealed he is finding it ' difficult ' to sleep following the collapse of a 23 - storey tower block in @entity8			1
the release of a series of images from a hospital visit coincidence with the publication of photos showing relatives crying as a @entity8 official apologies for the building 's collapse in @entity19 at the weekend - an unusual move from the secretive state			1
the undated pictures were released by @entity8 's official news agency and show the 31 - year - old accompanied by his wife @entity27 meeting with children at a baby home and orphanage as he visits the @entity32 in @entity19			1
in many of the photos the leader is wearing a white doctor 's coat as she grins for the camera			0
at one point two little boys even pull on his arms as he walks down a corridor in the newly - built hospital			0
the timely release of the photos could be an attempt to steer public attention away from the accident - scores , if not hundreds , of people are feared dead or seriously injured after the building collapsed in what officials surprisingly conceded was an ' unimaginable accident '			1
the word of the collapse in the secretive nation 's capital was reported sunday morning by the @entity8 's official @entity79 , which gave no death toll but said that the accident was ' serious ' and upset @entity8 's leader			1
the report said it occurred in the capital 's @entity85 district on tuesday ' as the construction of an apartment house was not done properly and officials supervised and controlled it in an irresponsible manner			2
' the photos were released today and one of them shows the children trying to get closer to @entity4 during the visit a toddler looks entertained by the visit as she clutches on to the dictator who is kitted out in a white coat , although a nurse and another little girl behind the leader look less enamored with his presence @entity104 previously visited @entity105 when it was being built by the @entity106 last year			2
@entity79 says the hospital covers a total plot of more than 100,000 square meters at certain points the dictator had a white coat draped over his clothing as he met with patients in the wards with his wife standing alongside during the visit the leader was seen giving instructions to officials who accompanied him during the visit in @entity127 , a @entity122 government official speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information said the apartment building that collapsed was presumed to have housed 92 families			0
that could mean the casualties could be in the hundreds because a typical @entity8 family has four members			2
however , it was not clear whether all the residents were inside at the time of the collapse , or that four people lived in each apartment			0
it is not unusual for people to start living in apartments before the construction is complete			0
the official said he did not have any figure for the actual death toll			0
according to the @entity79 report , the rescue operation ended saturday and officials apologised to bereaved families and district residents			0
on the streets of @entity19 on sunday , residents expressed outrage over the incident			2
a construction division officer apologises to residents after the collapse of a tower block in @entity19 left a large number of people dead @entity8 officials offered a rare public apology for the collapse of the apartment building under construction in @entity19 , which a @entity122 official said was believed to have caused considerable casualties that could mean hundreds might have died ' this accident happened because they broke the rules and methods of construction , ' resident @entity174 told @entity175			1
' after this accident , we must make sure that this kind of terrible accident never happens again , by sticking to the proper method of building			0
' another resident , @entity183 , said that ' everyone in @entity19 is now sharing the sorrow of the victims and the bereaved families			0
' the @entity79 report cited one official as saying @entity4 ' sat up all night , feeling painful after being told about the accident			0
' @entity8 's highly controlled state media rarely report news that might be considered negative , and an admission of fault by the government is unusual			1
the word of the collapse in the secretive nation 's capital was reported by the @entity8 's official @entity79 , which gave no death toll but said that the accident was ' serious ' and upset @entity8 's leader families of victims of an accident at an apartment construction site in @entity19 grieve during a gathering in the capital high rise city : the block of flats was under construction but it is believed that many families had moved in before the block was completed the country regularly blames @entity122 for starting the 1950 - 53 @entity217 , although outside historians say that the @entity219 attacked first			1
@entity8 also denies responsibility for an attack on a @entity122 warship that killed 46 people in 2010 , despite a @entity122 - led international investigation that blamed a @entity19 torpedo			1
sometimes , however , the country owns up to failures			0
many were surprised when the @entity8 admitted in 2012 that a high - profile rocket launch fizzled soon after takeoff - an acknowledgement that followed @entity19 's claiming of success for other such launches that foreign governments said had been failures			1
the building collapse came at a time when the @entity122 government has received near daily criticism from its citizens as well as regular bashing by @entity8 media for its handling of last month 's ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing .			2

it follows news of at the weekend of a block of flats under construction collapsing in capital city of @entity19
