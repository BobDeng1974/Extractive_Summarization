resplendent in a navy coat with a @entity4 faux fur collar and carrying a bag by @entity7 designer @entity6 , @entity0 happily posed with fans for some silly selfies this afternoon as she enjoyed a third day of racing action at @entity11			1
earlier , she had been spotted with husband @entity12 with both glued to their smartphones as they arrived for the traditional @entity16 's thursday at the annual racing event			1
@entity0 , a former rugby player , and @entity19 were both chatting away on their mobiles although both put their phones away once they got inside and the racing action kicked off			1
but today , she was happy to take a back seat , smiling and laughing with her husband as they watched jockey @entity54 pilot the hotly tipped @entity55 to first place in the opening race of the day , the @entity58			0
the queen 's granddaughter has become a familiar face at @entity11 this week , having begun it on tuesday , when she arrived to watch the action in a chic navy coat by @entity6 , from whom she ordered four separate ensembles for the week of racing			2
earlier in the day @entity19 and husband @entity12 had been spotted glued to their own smartphones as they arrived at the @entity70 event @entity71 : @entity19 and @entity12 both looked happy to be at the racecourse and smiled as they made their way inside @entity75 saw her return to the races for a second time , although she chose to spend the day with friends rather than join her aunt , the @entity80 , in her private box			1
despite @entity19 's chic black and grey checked outfit , it was @entity86 who ended up making a splash , after she bumped into glamour model @entity89 in the paddock while presenting jockey @entity91 with his trophy following his win in the @entity94			2
ms @entity89 , 36 , was in the paddock with her plasterer husband @entity96 , 27 , and her hairdresser when she spied @entity86 and promptly sidled up to ask for a photo			0
sharing a joke : later , @entity19 was spotted laughing happily with friends as she waited for the races to begin taking it seriously : @entity19 is building up a reputation for point - to - point training and last year worked with bay gelding @entity105 not impressed : @entity19 looked less than impressed with the performance of one of the runners , at one point allowing herself a grimace has one won ? @entity19 and her friends look on as they watch the racing action on @entity115 looking good : @entity19 cut an elegant figure in her blue coat , brown boots and matching velvet cocktail hat glamorous : on @entity75 , @entity19 arrived looking lovely in a neat black and white houndstooth coat and a black fascinator chic : day one saw her dress up in an all - navy ensemble by veteran designer @entity6 , from whom she has ordered four ensembles unexpected : yesterday saw the @entity80 make headlines after she was accosted in the paddock by glamour model @entity89 smile ! the model asked for a photo with @entity86 , with her daughter , @entity134 , also joining the pair for a photo having a chat : @entity86 also bumped into @entity138 author @entity138 who partially based cad @entity139 on her ex-husband family outing : as well as daughter @entity134 , the @entity80 was also joined by her son @entity143 for the day @entity144 , who cheerfully obliged , also bumped into another famous face - the author @entity138 , who famously based her showjumping cad @entity139 on @entity86 's ex-husband , @entity149			1
ms @entity138 , who lives in @entity150 , is no stranger to the world of racing herself , having immersed herself in it while writing her most recent novel , jump ! , which like all the @entity155 , features @entity154			0
today , however , @entity19 , who lives close to the racecourse at @entity158 , was the only royal in the field and took centre stage while watching the racing with her husband and a group of friends			0
the presence of the royals notwithstanding , the big highlight of @entity16 's thursday is the @entity168 , which will see veteran jockey @entity169 back in the saddle aboard the hotly tipped @entity171			0
duchess doppelgangers : day three of the @entity11 also attracted more than one duchess of @entity175 lookalike hats you win : racegoers showed off a wide range of hats , among them headbands , fedoras and feathered cocktail numbers on trend : a lady arrives in a fashionable graphic print dress while another ( right ) livens up a classic country coat with pink chinos dressed to impress : a lady in a fur coat , left , joins a crowd that includes a well - dressed lady in pink ( centre ) and another in green showing their colours : the @entity11 went green as racegoers arrived decked out in the colours of the @entity7 flag galloping home : @entity54 triumphed in the first race of the day and galloped home to win with @entity55 packed : the @entity150 racecourse was awash with punters as revellers turned out on day three of the @entity11			0

@entity0 posed happily for selfies with fans as she spent her third day at the races
earlier her and husband @entity12 were both glued to their phones
the couple later put down their mobiles as the action got *underway* , beginning with the @entity58
@entity19 was once again in @entity6 , from whom she ordered four different ensembles for @entity11
