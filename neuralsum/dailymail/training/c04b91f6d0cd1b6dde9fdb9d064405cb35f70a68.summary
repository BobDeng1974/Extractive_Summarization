' the president has a very good sense of what 's happening at the border , ' @entity12 said during his daily press briefing			1
' he 's getting regular updates from his officials who 've traveled to that region			0
they 're focused on solving this problem			0
' ' and what the president wants is ... regular reports about what they 're seeing on the border , and how resources that are being devoted to processing these -- those who have appeared at the border , are being used to effectively administrate justice			0
ai n't nobody got time for that : president @entity2 will hold fundraisers for @entity6 candidates for @entity43 when he visits @entity8 next week but he does n't plan to go see the humanitarian crisis on the border the original impetus of the president 's travel to @entity8 was a pair of @entity51 fundraisers taking place on wednesday and thursday in @entity53 , which is located near the middle of the large southern state			1
news outlets first began reporting the trip last weekend , and the @entity1 confirmed earlier this week that @entity2 was in fact planning to appear at political events in the state			1
the first fundraiser will take place at filmmaker @entity64 ' home			0
tickets to that event reportedly cost between $ 5,000 and $ 32,400			0

today the president will also participate in another ' @entity76 ' event , in which he meets face to face with someone who wrote him a letter			2
in this instance , @entity2 will meet with a @entity8 resident who sent the @entity1 a message praising the president 's economic policies			1
he will not , however , make a pit stop at the border , @entity12 said			1
president @entity2 made a surprise trip to tech startup hub 1776 this morning in @entity90 to talk about about job growth and meet with young entrepreneurs the president 's trip 1776 today was the latest in a string of attempts by the president to get out of the @entity1 bubble questions about a potential presidential visit to the border first arose during the @entity1 press briefing on tuesday			1
asked whether @entity2 would visit the overcrowded detention facilities in the @entity105 area during his upcoming visit to @entity8 so he could observe the humanitarian crisis with his own eyes , @entity12 said , ' at this point , no , ' @entity12 said			1
' but if there are any changes to the schedule we 'll let you know			0
' @entity12 was again asked about @entity2 's plans on wednesday , after @entity8 governor @entity116 invited the president to come visit the border in person during an appearance on @entity121 and friends that morning			1
' if he does n’t come to the border , i think it ’s a real reflection of his lack of concern of what ’s really going on there , ' @entity116 said			0
' if the @entity131 is really serious about securing that border , we can show him how to do that , ' the former @entity130 presidential candidate said			0
' but i have n’t even had a phone call from this president			0
' on wednesday @entity12 said @entity2 still had no plans to visit the border but he ' would n’t rule it out until the day of			2
' ' our focus at this point is to plan to do something else , ' he said			0
likewise , @entity12 , ' the most important thing ' people like @entity116 could do ' is not offer public invitations but actually to lend their public support to comprehensive immigration reform			0
' the @entity1 official also explained that the president does n't need to travel to the border because other senior administration officials , including homeland security secretary @entity152 , @entity154 secretary @entity153 and director of white house domestic policy @entity155 , have recently traveled to the border			1
@entity1 press secretary @entity158 got hammered with questions from reporters today about the president 's upcoming trip to @entity8 and his decision not to visit the border while he 's there @entity1 minority leader @entity166 visited @entity167 , @entity8 , last saturday to show her support for comprehensive immigration reform			1
the president opted not to join her on the trip			0
@entity152 and @entity153 were just in @entity171 , @entity8 , on monday to speak with border patrol officers and receive an update on the federal government 's efforts to feed , clothe , house and treat the overpowering number of unaccompanied minors being held in the area 's detention facilities			1
last week , @entity152 visited illegal immigrant children being held at @entity182 , @entity183 , detention centers			2
' so this is something that the administration is paying very close attention to , ' @entity12 said during yesterday 's briefing			0
' the president is getting regular updates on this situation			0
' ' this president is obviously very attuned to what ’s happening at the border , ' he said at another point			0
after a reporter asked if @entity12 was ' comfortable with the optics of the president going for fundraisers only and not taking an eyeball look himself on the border ? ' @entity12 said @entity2 's trip would ' include some activities other than just building some support for @entity6 candidates for office who are on the ballot in november			1
' @entity2 's trip came up a third time during today 's briefing to @entity12 's chagrin			2
the newly minted senior administration official first repeated previous statements about @entity2 's travel schedule , and then said : ' i think the reason that some people are suggesting the reason the president go to the border when he 's in @entity8 is because they 'd rather play politics than actually try to address some of these challenges			1
' ' if they were committed to solving the problem , you know , for example in the case of the @entity8 governor , he could probably be pretty useful , i hear he 's a pretty persuasive fellow , that he could pick up the phone , and call up some of those @entity130 members of @entity43 from @entity8 who are standing foursquare against common sense immigration reform , ' @entity12 said a few minutes later			2
' if the governor were genuinely concerned about solving so many of these problems that exist on the border , the most impactful thing he could do right now , is encourage those @entity130 members of the @entity239 to stop blocking common sense legislation from coming to the floor of the @entity239			0
' the president 's comprehensive immigration reform legislation passed in the @entity244 last summer , but @entity1 speaker @entity245 has refused to bring it to the @entity1 floor			2
@entity245 has said that he will not introduce immigration legislation until the president agrees to a step - by - step approach instead			0
gov. @entity116 shakes hands with @entity253 spokesperson sgt. @entity252 after touring the @entity255 station on monday president @entity2 is one of the only a few high - profile @entity90 officials who has n't visited the border since news outlets began reporting on how poorly the unaccompanied minors coming to the @entity3 were being treated in detention facilities			1
pictures of children sleeping in piles on the floor without mattresses or blankets caused an uproar , and the @entity2 administration had to act suddenly to resolve the situation			1
the president announced more than $ 250 million in new aid to the @entity274 countries from which the kids are primarily migrating from and sent both vice president @entity276 and secretary of state @entity277 to to speak with leaders of @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 about the importance of shutting down the criminal networks that are smuggling children in through the @entity3 border with @entity279			1
on monday the president announced that he was using his executive authority to direct the @entity289 to ' refocus ' its resources from the interior of the country to its @entity294 border			0
the president himself is yet to meet in person with @entity274 leaders or any of the 52,000 children who fled their home countries to come to the @entity3 in the last year			1
last weekend @entity1 minority leader @entity166 and other members of the president 's party made the trek to the border to stand in solidarity with the immigrant children and show their support for immigration reform			1
today , members of the @entity311 took a field trip to @entity171 to hear from @entity116 and @entity8 law enforcement officials			2
during the field hearing , which took place on the campus of @entity317 , @entity116 asked the government to pay back @entity8 the $ 500 million his state had spent since 2005 on border security efforts			2
' we have been fulfilling a federal responsibility , ' @entity116 said			0
' the hardworking people of the state of @entity8 should n't be shouldering that cost			0
' the @entity8 governor also called on the president to send 1,000 @entity329 members to his state to help secure the border			2
' the power of boots on the ground can not be overstated , ' @entity116 said			0
' the message needs to be not , if you come into the @entity3 , you 'll be deported , " but , " you wo n't enter the @entity3			1
" ' the president said last week that he would send more border patrol agents to @entity8 , but he 's ignored multiple requests from @entity130 officials to deploy the @entity329 .			1

president @entity2 is traveling to @entity8 next week to attend @entity6 fundraisers
while he 's there he 'll also meet with a supporter who wrote him a letter
he wo n't visit the border to see any of the captured @entity274 children who are piling up in detention facilities , however
the @entity1 says he does n't need to make a pit stop at the border because he 's ' well aware ' of the situation
@entity1 press secretary @entity158 said other administration officials who have been to the border are updating @entity2 on the situation , and that 's how the president wants it to stay
