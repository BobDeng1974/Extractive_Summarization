speaking at the @entity43 session in @entity44 , @entity0 said : ' you have to say that the scope and scale of these allegations takes it beyond simply a competitor deciding to step beyond the moral boundary			2
' this is not in every country of the world - there are 213 federations			0
but you do have to say a disproportionate amount of the reputational damage is in a relatively small number of countries , and i think we have to recognise this			1
' they are very serious allegations			2
the very fact that the allegations are in the public domain means that they are serious			0
