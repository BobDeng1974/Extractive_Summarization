by @entity0 published : 12:44 est , 4 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:39 est , 4 december 2013 just 18 months after its maiden voyage , the @entity4 flying car can finally be yours - if you have a spare $ 295,999 that is			1
technically it 's not a car - it 's a three - wheeled motorcyle that transforms into a gyrocopter - but it is legal to drive , and fly , and switches between modes in just 10 minutes			1
the @entity16 - built @entity4 can reach speeds of up to 112mph and goes from 0 to 60 in under 8 seconds when driven on the road			1
it takes 10 minutes to switch between modes and can go from 0 to 60 in the air in under 8 seconds the two - seater vehicle converts from a three - wheeled motorcycle to a gyrocopter in 10 minutes			1
it has 230hp , four - cylinder engine and reaches speeds of up 112 mph in the air or on the road			1
the helicycle goes from 0 to 60 mph in under eight seconds			0
the gyrocopter is designed to cruise at low altitudes ( below 4,000ft ) and it requires a 540ft runway for take - offs			1
for landing , the vehicle needs just 100 ft. the 27 - gallon gas tank provides a 220 - mile flight range ( 750 miles on the road )			2
it is made from carbon fiber , titanium , and aluminum and weighs 1,499lbs			0
owners must have a sports pilot certificate to fly the vehicle			1
owners will need a sports pilot certificate to fly one			1
the two - seater vehicle is on sale in the 2013 @entity61 catalogue under the name @entity63 , yet its design and specifications are identical to the @entity4 's			2
like many flying car prototypes , including the @entity67 from @entity69 - based @entity68 , the @entity4 needs a 540ft runway in order to take - off			2
when in flight mode , the vehicle looks like a helicopter , however , it is known as a gyrocopter or autogyro because the main power comes from the rotors at the rear of the vehicle			1
its rotors spin considerably slower than a helicopter 's blades , too , and ca n't stall			0
on the ground , the machine handles somewhere between a motorbike and a racing car - its chassis is built to lean into turns , and the two - seater can reach speeds of up to 112mph			2
unlike most fictional flying cars , of course , it ca n't just extend its rotors then hurtle skywards - the process takes about ten minutes			0
the @entity4 , pictrured , needs a 540ft runway in order to take - off			0
when in flight mode , the vehicle looks like a helicopter , however , it is known as a gyrocopter or autogyro because the main power comes from the rotors at the rear of the vehicle once the engine stops , the propeller folds itself automatically into the driving position			1
pushing a button then lowers the rotor mast into the horizontal position			0
rotor blades and tail have to be stowed away by the driver			0
' on the ground the vehicle drives like a sports car , ' said @entity4 ' within minutes its rotor is unfolded and its tail is extended : then it is ready to take off thanks to the advanced gyrocopter technology			1
' the gyrocopter , pictured , is designed to cruise at low altitudes , below 4,000ft			2
although it needs a 540ft runway for take - off , it only needs 100ft to land the 27 - gallon gas tank in the @entity4 , pictured , provides a 220 - mile flight range or 750 miles on the road			2
it is made from carbon fiber , titanium , and aluminum and weighs 1,499lbs the @entity4 is on sale from retailer @entity134 under the name @entity63 - but the specifications are the same			0
it can reach speeds of up to 112 mph and tilts like a motorcycle when turning corners , left			0
the helicycle goes from 0 to 60 mph in under eight seconds on the road , as well ' with these successful test results it is proven that it is not only possible to build a flying car but also that it can be done within existing international rules for both flying and driving			0
' the @entity4 features a 230hp , four - cylinder engine powered by petrol			0
its 27 gallon tank means pilots can fly for up to 220 miles at low altitudes - around 4,000ft - or drive for up 750 miles			2
it is made of carbon fiber , titanium , and aluminum and weighs 1,500lbs			0
the @entity4 completed its maiden voyage just 18 months ago			0
it is available in red , pictured , or black to drive and fly the @entity4 , pictured , owners must have a driving license and a sports pilot certificate			1

@entity4 is a motorcycle and gyrocopter and costs $ 295,000 ( Â£ 180,000 )
it switches between drive and flight mode in just 10 minutes
owners must have a driving license and a sports pilot certificate
the vehicle reaches speeds of 112mph and flies at altitudes of 4,000ft
