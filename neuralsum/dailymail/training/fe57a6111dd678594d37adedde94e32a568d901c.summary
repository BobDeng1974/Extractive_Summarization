@entity2 provided fake certificates to the ringleader of the gang who went on to create false identities for up to 100 children to milk the benefits system			1
@entity22 @entity21 heard how the @entity24 - born father of three was ultimately trapped by a text message which , despite his denial , showed he knew the gang ’s chief conspirator , @entity5 - born @entity27 , 49			2
last year the same court heard how she was at the centre of the scam which also saw her claim to be suffering from @entity35 and needing costly drugs – yet in reality she sent them back to @entity5 to be sold for huge profits			0
supplying the drugs for so many years cost the taxpayer more than £ 2million			1
the gang exploited false identities in the fraud relating to accommodation and sub-letting of flats at a cost of £ 650,000 , and various benefits totalling £ 900,000			1
this week 46 - year - old @entity50 ’s role in the scam was exposed as prosecutor @entity52 told the jury : ‘ this case revolves around the making of false identities for children and @entity2 as a registrar was at the centre of helping make those identities			1
‘ while he denies any knowledge of knowing @entity27 there is an incriminating text message directly from his mobile phone to hers which was found by the investigating authorities			0
‘ these certificates enabled the gang to make numerous false claims for both child benefits and child tax credits and other allowances			1
’ the court heard how @entity50 started to work for the @entity74 in @entity75 in 2004 before becoming a registrar in 2006 and a senior registrar a year later			1
he was later introduced to @entity27 and her gang and began providing false birth certificates for use in their long - running conspiracy			1
as a registrar , he had a duty to request confirmation of a birth , with an @entity87 number from the hospital where the child had supposedly been born			1
instead , he simply filled out birth certificates after being given names by the gang			1
guilty as charged : mr @entity50 was found guilty of aiding the £ 4million benefits fraud at @entity94 staff became suspicious and @entity50 became the subject of an internal investigation while the @entity98 and police investigated @entity27 and her gang			1
when she and fellow gang members were arrested in september 2011 a ‘ kit bag for fraud ’ containing documents and birth certificates was found			1
these included five issued by @entity2 for false identities – all supposedly ‘ born ’ earlier that year			2
a text from his phone to one of @entity27 ’s six mobiles read : ‘ just remember if anyone asks anything about you and me deny that you know me			0
i do n’t know anyone too			0
’ investigators were unable to discover how much @entity50 , from @entity121 , @entity122 , had been paid by the gang			1

@entity124 , who wore a dog collar under his suit while in the dock at @entity94 , faces one specimen charge of conspiring to facilitate unlawful marriage and 13 charges of assisting illegal entry into the @entity149			0
an investigation by the @entity98 ’s @entity151 , which saw @entity124 ’s church searched for evidence , led to his arrest in june 2011			0
his address was not read out in court but it is thought that he lives in a house attached to the church			0
@entity135 , from @entity159 , @entity22 , was arrested in november 2011			0
@entity124 was bailed yesterday and a plea hearing was scheduled for march 22			0
the number of alleged sham ceremonies was not mentioned at yesterday ’s preliminary hearing			0
in 2010 the @entity164 was jailed for presiding over 360 fake weddings in @entity166 , in what the @entity167 described at the time as the biggest sham marriage case it had seen			2
@entity27 claimed hiv / aids drugs costing £ 2,280,000			2
she also received £ 500,000 in housing benefit from @entity172			2
she came to the @entity149 in 1991 and claimed asylum for herself and four ‘ children ’			2
three years later , she used a different name to apply again – with two more ‘ children ’			1
in 1999 , using yet another name , she applied once more for asylum , this time with three ‘ children ’			2
she is believed to have regularly travelled back to @entity5 and bought at least three properties there			0
in november she was jailed for six years while the rest of her gang received sentences totalling 19 years between them			1
@entity50 denied misconduct in a judicial or public office and five counts of fraud but it took the jury only 90 minutes to find him guilty of all six charges			1
the judge refused his request to be allowed to go home before sentencing next week to see his family			0
he was remanded in custody and refused bail			0
recorder @entity197 told @entity2 : ‘ the unique feature of this case is serious misconduct while in public office and abuse of trust and that is particularly serious			0
’ the maximum sentence misconduct in a judicial or public office is life imprisonment .			0
