house speaker @entity0 credited a controversial government surveillance program on thursday for helping uncover an alleged plot by an @entity4 man to bomb the @entity5 and kill government officials			1
' the first thing that strikes me is that we would have never known about this had it not been for the @entity12 [ @entity12 ] program and our ability to collect information on people who pose an imminent threat			1
' he addressed the topic during a news conference at a retreat of @entity22 lawmakers in @entity23 , @entity24			1
@entity12 allows the @entity25 to obtain search warrants and communications intercepts in intelligence cases , subject to the approval of a specialized and secretive court			1
' our government does not spy on @entity36 , unless they are @entity36 who are doing things that frankly tip off our law enforcement officials to an imminent threat			2
it was our law enforcement officials and those programs that helped us stop this person before he committed a heinous crime in our nation 's capital			0
' ' we live in a dangerous country , ' @entity0 said , ' and we get reminded every week of the dangers that are out there			2
we saw what happened in @entity62 a week ago			0
' he declined to dwell on a separate case , involving a man with a history of psychiatric illness who was charged last week with threatening to murder him , possibly by poisoning his drink			1
' my personal situation , i 'm not going to get into it , ' @entity0 said , ' but , you know , it 's one thing to get a threat from far away			2
it 's another when it 's three doors from where you live			0
' ' obviously , this young man has got some health issues , mental health issues , that need to be addressed , and i hope he gets the help that he needs			0
' it is somewhat unusual for officials to publicly disclose investigative techniques			0
government officials say @entity89 's suspected terror plot was in the early stages of development and posed no immediate threat to lawmakers and @entity5 staff , but they took him down out of an abundance of caution but @entity0 said he was mentioning @entity12 deliberately in the investigation of @entity39 , also known as @entity99 , because it must be renewed by @entity100 soon			1
@entity39 was arrested wednesday after buying two semi-automatic rifles and about 600 rounds of ammunition , authorities said			0
the public was never in danger , said @entity107 , acting special agent in charge of the @entity25 's @entity110 division			0
a criminal complaint filed in the case indicates that a confidential informant brought @entity89 to the @entity25 's attention in the fall of 2014 , after the two began communicating over @entity117			0
it is possible the @entity25 obtained search and surveillance warrants aimed at @entity89 under @entity12 , but the criminal complaint does n't say so .			1

the @entity4 @entity22 credited the @entity12 courts and secret government snooping for uncovering the plot
program allows *intrusive* surveillance subject to a specialized court *system* , and is *due* to be renewed soon by @entity100
@entity0 *expects* a fight from liberals â€“ and from civil *libertarians* in his own caucus
he also declined to go into *detail* about a separate case involving a mentally *unstable* man who threatened to poison him
