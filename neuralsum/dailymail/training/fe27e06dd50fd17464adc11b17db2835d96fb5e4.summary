next year @entity29 will hold a final vote on whether to build a new generation of submarines in a £ 20billion ‘ like for like ’ replacement of @entity4			1
@entity1 ’s position on @entity4 could be a key factor in any coalition deal after the may election – and the @entity8 could end up handing mr @entity0 the keys to @entity39 if it wins enough seats to prop him up and deliver a @entity42 majority			1
the issue could also help mr @entity0 in negotiations with the @entity45 and the @entity46			0

the missiles have a range of 7,500 miles and are accurate to a few feet			0
they are carried by four submarines - @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity95			0
