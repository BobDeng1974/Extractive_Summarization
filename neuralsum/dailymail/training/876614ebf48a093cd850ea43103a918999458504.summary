the person ‘ familiar with the plans ’ said @entity3 is developing a 4.7 - inch as well as a 5.5 - inch model to rival @entity15 and @entity17 ’s latest bendy handsets			1
sources claim @entity3 is working on 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch phones with curved displays to rival @entity15 's @entity21 and @entity17 's @entity22			1
the new handsets are said to be ' still in development ' meaning they may not be released until at least september 2014 @entity3 announced last week it plans to open a mineral plant in @entity27 that will make components for its high - end phones and tablet			1
it has partnered with @entity31 , suppliers of sapphire - based materials , and this has led many to believe @entity3 ’s next generation of screens could feature strong , scratch - resistant sapphire glass			2
the firm already uses sapphire glass in the fingerprint scanner of its @entity41 , as well as to protect the camera lenses on its new devices			0
according to @entity48 journalists @entity45 and @entity46 , the two phones are expected to curve along the side edges			0
this would make them more like @entity17 ’s @entity22 handset , rather than @entity15 ’s @entity21 phone which curves along the top and bottom edges			1
reports added @entity3 ’s curved glass could also come with sensors capable of identifying how heavy , or light , a user ’s touch is , meaning it could distinguish different pressure points			2
the benefits of this feature have not been explained			0
both of @entity3 's new handsets are said to be ‘ still in development ’ meaning they may not be released until at least september 2014			1
this would coincide with @entity3 ’s annual product launch			0

this would make them more like @entity17 's @entity22 phone , pictured , rather than @entity15 's @entity21 handset that curves along the top and bottom edges			2

both phones are only currently available in @entity84			2
the round is curved along the top to make it more comfortable to hold in the hand @entity15 released its curved @entity21 last month , followed shortly by @entity17 ’s @entity22 phone – yet both are only currently available in @entity84			1
@entity3 has traditionally stuck with smaller screens , and its latest @entity92 and @entity41 devices are only 4 - inches big			0
this is compared to @entity17 's @entity22 , for example , which as a 6 - inch screen while the @entity21 's display is 5.7 inches big			1
other features of the @entity21 that take advantage of the curved display include what 's dubbed @entity101			0
this lets users roll the phone towards them to see the date , time , missed calls and battery life without pressing the power button or activating the home screen			0
@entity3 recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire - based materials			0
@entity3 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity117 fingerprint scanner on its @entity41 , pictured , and to protect the cameras on its latest models			0
