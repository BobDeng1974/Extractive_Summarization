@entity0 , of @entity2 programme , said that some secular teachers are also ‘ unsympathetic to religious education ’			1
as a result , many pupils are not learning the crucial fact that @entity9 celebrates the birth of @entity20			1
a lack of understanding of @entity23 is also preventing youngsters from gaining a proper understanding of religious imagery in literature and drama as well as @entity30 art. this ‘ ignorance ’ in schools is being compounded by broadcasters ’ reluctance to tackle ‘ faith issues ’ in children ’s programmes			1
mr @entity0 , who previously presented sunday , @entity2 ’s main programme for religious news and current affairs , condemned the trend in a ‘ viewpoint ’ piece written for this weeks @entity43			1
he said the @entity46 single , do they know it ’s @entity9 ? would be better renamed for school children as ‘ do they know @entity49 ? ’ he said : ‘ older readers might think this is a redundant question , but i ’m afraid it ’s not			1
‘ in some schools in this country , little is taught about the true meaning of @entity9 , possibly because secular staff are unsympathetic to religious education or because of the fear of offending those of other faiths			2
‘ and broadcasters are n’t doing much to remedy this ignorance			0
it is difficult to find any children ’s programmes that regularly deal with faith issues			0
’ mr @entity0 said there were ‘ exceptions ’ such as @entity68 , a @entity70 animation this @entity9 , which is based on @entity72 author , @entity71 ’ s picture book			1
it tells the @entity9 story from the point of view of a young shepherd boy			0
‘ but there is little else in prospect , and the consequences of this lack of coverage are becoming evident , ’ he said			2
the presenter pointed to a @entity87 survey published earlier this year that claimed a quarter of children had ‘ never read , seen or heard of @entity89 ’			2
fear of ‘ offending ’ different faiths means pupils are not being taught the true meaning of @entity9 in schools , according to a @entity12 presenter a similar proportion was ignorant of the @entity97 ; 43 per cent had never heard of the @entity98 , and 53 per cent had ‘ never read , seen or heard ’ of @entity99 and his coat of many colours			0

‘ in the time of @entity119 what one believed about the doctrine of ‘ transubstantiation ’ was literally a matter of life and death			0
‘ our 17th - century @entity122 was fought in large part over the doctrine of the @entity126			0
‘ without a knowledge of @entity23 , what will our schoolchildren make of much of our finest literature and drama , filled as it is with @entity23 imagery ? or much of the finest @entity30 art ? ’ a lack of understanding of @entity23 is also preventing youngsters from gaining a proper understanding of religious imagery in literature and drama as well as @entity30 art mr @entity0 said the @entity46 single , do they know it ’s @entity9 ? would be better renamed for school children as ‘ do they know @entity49 ? ’ he added : ‘ it is also vital that children of other faiths learn about @entity9			1
how can they begin to integrate into our country if they know little of the faith still at its heart ? ‘ of course , the reverse applies , too			0
how can they feel welcome in this country if we make no real effort to understand what is often the most important thing to them and their families – their faiths ? ’ a better understanding of faith ‘ would also do politicians no harm when they come to debate whether or not to intervene in parts of the world where religion is still a matter of life and death ’			2
