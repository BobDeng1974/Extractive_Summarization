by @entity0 it 's a question that has exercised the greatest minds on the internet , but until now there has been no definitive answer			1
how tall can tower of @entity7 be built before the bricks at the bottom buckle under the strain ? now engineers at the @entity12 have finally come up with the solution to the conundrum and , here 's a clue , its probably going to be bigger than you think			1
but it is thanks to the @entity31 that the answer was found after @entity35 's @entity34 programme asked academics to get into their labs and test it out on a hydraulic press			1
dr @entity40 , an applied mathematician and lecturer in engineering , told the broadcaster : ' it 's an exciting thing to do because it 's an entirely new question and new questions are always interesting			1
' it 's already known that @entity7 is extremely resilient , with the company this @entity48 enlisting 4,000 @entity50 children to erecting a record - breaking tower in @entity23 measuring a dizzying 105ft high			2
but every building material has some theoretical limit beyond which it can not be used and , before even higher @entity7 towers can be built , it would be sensible how much the plastic bricks can suffer			0
lab conditions : a team from the @entity12 's @entity59 put a 2x2 @entity7 brick on a hydraulic press then measured how much pressure it was able to take before buckling under the stress to work out how tall a tower can be built before it crushes itself , researchers need to find out two things : the total mass of the building material used and its yield strength			1
this latter factor is how much pressure a material can take before it breaks			2
to find it out dr @entity40 's team took a vulnerable - looking 2x2 @entity7 brick and placed it on a metal plate atop a hydraulic ram			1
' plastic failure ' : this is how a 2x2 @entity7 brick looks after a load of 432kg pushes down on to it across the brick they placed a second plate attached to a load cell to measure the force pushing upwards			1
then they put on safety glasses and slowly backed away			2
ratcheting up the pressure on the hydraulic testing machine , they sailed past 3,500 newtons of force , which is the equivalent of having 350kg ( a third of a tonne ) pushing down on the brick			1
eventually the load reached a phenomenal @entity101 - equivalent to 432kg - and the brick slowly began to deform after reaching what dr @entity40 explained was its ' material failure '			2
' the material is just flowing out of the way now and it 's not able to take any more			2
we 're getting a plastic failure , ' he said			0
' it means the brick keeps on deforming , without the load increasing			0
metals can be plastic , and this plastic is being plastic			0
' repeating the experiment showed again that the average 2x2 @entity7 brick , each made of @entity120 plastic , can carry a mass of 432kg			0
once that figure was known , working out how high a @entity7 tower could be was easy			0
with an average 2x2 @entity7 brick having a mass of 1.152g and the total mass a single brick can carry being 432kg , dividing the former by the latter gives the grand total of bricks a single @entity7 brick can support : 375,000			0
multiply that by the height of the brick - 9.6mm - and it turns out that , theoretically , a tower of @entity134 ( 2.17 miles ) could be built before the one at the bottom has any problems			0
stresses : this graphic uploaded by a @entity25 user shows where the stresses would affect a 2x4 @entity7 block strong : dr @entity40 of the @entity12 says @entity7 bricks are so robust they could be used to build a replica of @entity148 that 's taller than @entity148 , dr @entity40 said			1
' so if the @entity152 gods wanted to build a new temple on @entity148 , and @entity148 was n't available , they could just - but no more - do it with @entity7 bricks , ' he added			0
' as long as they do n't jump up and down too much			0

engineers from the @entity12 put a brick in a hydraulic press to measure how much pressure one can take
it 's a lot , lot more than you might think
