@entity0 , 25 , from @entity1 , was previously obsessed with pink but when she gave birth to son @entity4 , she gradually began to redecorate until everything was blue her and her daughters ' rooms are still pink by @entity8 published : 05:59 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 15:03 est , 28 december 2012 everyone has a favourite colour , but one woman was so addicted to pink that she painted her entire house with the rosy hue			1
but after giving birth to a little boy she decided to re-decorate her whole house in blue to make him feel more at home			1
@entity0 , 25 , was so addicted to pink that everything in her life from her hairdryer to washing up gloves had the same pinky tint			1
out with the old : in her kitchen her pink cleaning products , toaster , kettle and washing up gloves were all thrown out to make way for their perfect blue replacements pink palace : @entity0 was addicted to the colour pink and decorated her whole house in the rosy hue but when she discovered she was pregnant with son @entity4 she decided it would n't be fair for him to grow up in her pink palace			1
@entity0 's cerise wallpaper in her living room was swapped for a flowery sky - blue print , the hot pink wall paint was covered over with navy , the rose rug was replaced by a teal one and the crimson coloured cushions on her sofa are now different shades of aqua			1
in her kitchen her pink cleaning products , toaster , kettle and washing up gloves were all thrown out to make way for their perfect blue replacements and even her previously girly bowls , plates and scissors are now hidden at the back of the cupboards while their indigo rivals are on display			1
@entity0 even featured on tv show @entity62 ? and had a make - under due to her outrageous style and make up			2
she was addicted to buying clothes , make - up , wigs , accessories and spent a fortune on her appearance every month , often spending hours at a time getting ready for a night out			0
but since giving birth to her son and becoming a full - time mother , those days are far behind her and she has even dyed her hair too			2
@entity0 , from @entity1 , @entity75 , whose son is now eight months old , said : ' when i found out i was having a boy my first thought was what was i going to do about all the pink			1
what a difference : @entity0 's famous pink loving days are far behind her feeling blue : the mother - of - three finally added the colour blue into her home once she discovered she was pregnant with a baby boy and realised he could n't grow up surrounded by pink ' i just thought to myself he ca n't be around all that pink , i could n't do that to him			1
' i was thinking about what it would be like when he was older and looked back at all his baby pictures and saw how everything was pink			2
' the pink was fine when it was just us girls , but not for him			2
it did take me quite a while to warm to the idea though			0
' the first thing i did was his bedroom and i made it yellow and then i started to add a few blue bits and then more and more			2
blue baby : @entity0 did n't want son @entity4 looking back on his photos and being surrounded by the colour pink , but her and her daughter 's rooms are still pink ' i think the yellow was to ease myself into the idea of getting rid of the pink			1
' and then around @entity117 time i started to do the living room blue			0
i decorated it completely , wall paper and painted it			0
little by little : she began by painting some parts of the house yellow to ease herself into getting rid of the pink and it slowly all became blue ' i got a new blue rug and a new couch and cushions			1
' i 've always wanted to have a boy but i was sort of expecting a girl , because i 'd already had two			0
' i wanted a boy , but i did n't want to get rid of the pink			0
' when @entity0 became a mother to two daughters she remembered how as a little girl she had dreamed of one day having an all pink bedroom			1
and she quickly decided she did n't want her girls to ever miss out on anything and from that moment began planning every little girls dream - a completely pink house			2
but after a brief relationship @entity0 discovered she was pregnant and was shocked to be told at her 20 week scan that it was a baby boy			2
instantly the mother 's mind raced as to how a little boy would cope growing up in her bright girly home			0
now , that the pink has gone @entity0 desperately misses her ' loud ' home but believes it is a sacrifice she has to make for her son			1
the mother has however kept her own bedroom and her daughter 's room as girly as possible with every single item being a perfect shade of pink - their own little ' girly piece of heaven			0
' @entity0 added : ' the girls were asking me where all the pink had gone , i think they were a bit upset too			1
' they did love it but i explained i got the flowers on the wallpaper just for them and they were happy again			0
unexpected : @entity0 had always wanted a boy but expected another little girl after having two already more subtle : @entity0 admits that she misses the happy , ' in your face ' pink hues but likes the darker and more subtle look ' everyone has said they like the new look better , that it 's much more toned down but i 'm still not sure myself really			1
' there 's still bits i need to finish off as there 's still the odd bit of pink around but i 'll be really sad to see it go			0
' i do miss it , it 's such a big difference now , before it was bright and happy and in your face , whereas now it 's a lot darker and more subtle			0
' i think it will just take some getting used to			0
' i did prefer the pink but i think it 's important for him , i ca n't be taking pictures of him with pink everywhere in the background			0
' my bedroom and the girls ' bedroom is still pink , it 's our little safe heavens			0
