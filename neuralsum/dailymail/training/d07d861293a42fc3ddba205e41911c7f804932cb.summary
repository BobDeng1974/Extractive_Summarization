by @entity1 reporter published : 18:37 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 18:37 est , 1 february 2013 the boy , named @entity3 , is 5½ years old , struggles at learning to count and draw , and lives in an orphanage in @entity5			1
his would - be parents in @entity7 have had just five brief visits since they signed on to adopt him in 2008 , yet they refuse to abandon the quest			1
' we have already bonded with this child , ' said @entity12			1
' probably a day does n't go by that we do n't think of him			2
in our mind , he 's our child			2
if we do n't wait for him , what 's his fate going to be ? ' still hopeful : @entity19 and @entity12 ( pictured ) of @entity7 are still trying to adopt the boy from @entity5 they named @entity22 , despite five years of bureaucratic shuffling @entity12 and her husband , @entity19 , were among a group initially known as the ' @entity26 ' — @entity27 who were in the process of adopting 65 orphans from the @entity30 when it suspended international adoptions in 2008 due to allegations of fraud			1
the group 's ranks have dwindled over the ensuing years while @entity5 's adoption system has been disrupted by political turmoil and persisting corruption problems			1
a little brother : the @entity41 adopted @entity42 , 1 , and hope he 'll soon meet his adopted big brother from @entity5 , where 65 adoptions to @entity27 families were abruptly halted in 2008 some of the @entity27 gave up , some of the children were placed in domestic adoptions , and last summer nine of the remaining children finally were allowed to go to @entity27			1
the @entity41 - @entity51 are now among 16 @entity27 families still waiting , five years later			1
@entity19 describes their predicament as ' an emotional roller - coaster			2
' but he and others in the waiting group are cautiously encouraged by the efforts of @entity5 's new social development minister , @entity58			2
a 35 - year - old @entity59 - speaker and avid @entity61 user , @entity58 has brought an uncharacteristic level of openness to government business in his post-soviet nation during six months on the job			2
he is working on new anti-corruption regulations and hopes for swift government approval that might help clear the way for the remaining @entity27 adoption cases to be completed			1
it 's not a sure thing			2
various anti-corruption and children 's rights activists in the @entity26 capital , @entity76 , have criticized the proposed rules as inadequate and vowed to oppose them			2
but one of the waiting @entity27 , @entity78 of @entity79 , @entity80 , said @entity58 nonetheless had raised hopes after so many disappointments			2
incomplete : @entity83 and @entity78 of @entity79 , @entity80 have adopted children from @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity5			2
they hoped to adopt another child from @entity5 in 2008 but , as with the @entity41 , their adoption was stopped ' we are so incredibly impressed and grateful for what he has done since taking over , ' @entity78 said			1
' he 's been the most vocal in favor of moving our cases forward			2
' @entity78 , a medical technician , and her husband , @entity94 , an aircraft maintenance manager , were matched in july 2008 with an infant @entity26 girl afflicted by a severe cleft lip and palate			1
they arranged for two operations for @entity100 that improved her condition , but pain and speech problems linger			2
family bonds : @entity105 has met @entity3 , the @entity26 boy he calls @entity22 , only five times but says he and his wife feel a deep bond with the child and remain committed to adopting him the @entity111 have four other adopted children with special needs , including a 6 - year - old boy adopted from @entity5 in 2007			1
but even with a bustling household , there 's no thought about dropping the quest to adopt @entity100 , whom they 've visited only once — last june			2
' she 's our daughter — it 's that simple , ' @entity78 said			0
' we promised her a family			0
we will not stop fighting for her until she 's here , where we feel she belongs			0
' @entity5 is an economically struggling country with often ill - equipped orphanages			0
resources are scarce , specialist training to care for severely disabled children is limited , and the daily food budget at some facilities is $ 1.50 per child			0
unscrupulous bureaucrats dealing in what was effectively a trade in children led to two halts in foreign adoptions — in 2006 and 2008 — by @entity26 authorities			1
last july , adoptions were again frozen after the arrest of @entity58 's predecessor , @entity142 , for allegedly extorting funds from foreign adoption agencies seeking accreditation			1
@entity142 eventually was acquitted , but nonetheless lost his post			0
under the new rules being pushed by @entity58 , any adoption agency working in @entity5 will have to secure separate agreements with four government ministries and with the security service , the successor to the @entity154 - era @entity153			1
foreign agencies will be required to provide detailed financial statements to reduce the odds of corruption			1
despite that , the @entity76 - based protection of @entity160 remains unconvinced and insists that many problems still need resolving			0
the league 's leader , @entity163 , says corrupt local officials and unscrupulous intermediaries are commonly seen at international adoption agencies ' offices			1
holding out hope : orphanages in @entity5 are notoriously underfunded and understaffed and the adoption system in the country remains mired with uncertainty while families in the @entity27 want desperately to open their homes to the orphans @entity58 described criticism of proposed adoption rules as ' absolutely irrational			1
' ' they are just using children for their own public relations aims , ' he said			0
' they are criticizing provisions they developed themselves and are thus delaying the reunification of @entity26 children with their parents			0
' @entity19 and @entity12 fervently hope for such a reunion with @entity3 , who they already consider their son			0
they 're hoping to rename him @entity22 , after the first names of their parents			0
joyous reunion : @entity195 holds @entity196 , one of the nine children from the original ' @entity198 ' who were allowed to be sent to their @entity27 families when adoptions briefly resumed last summer the couple is wary of sharing photos that show his face , for fear of breaching adoption protocol			1
but they readily recall their five visits with him , dating back to june 2008 , when he was 7 months old and they found him at his orphanage in a large pen filled with crying children			1
their last meeting was in july 2012			0
since then , said @entity105 , they 've been sending letters and packages but have been told not to visit			0
' you 're introduced to a child , and they become part of your heart , part of your family , ' @entity19 said			0
' then there are the delays , all the ups and downs			0
you have your hopes raised and they 're dashed again			0
' @entity19 , an environmental engineering consultant , and @entity12 , who works for @entity7 's @entity234 , completed a domestic adoption while waiting for a resolution in @entity5			1
they 're intent that son @entity42 , who turns 2 on feb. 22 , will have an older brother			0
still waiting : @entity239 ( center ) adopted his son @entity241 ( left ) from @entity5 in 2007 and took him to visit @entity242 ( right ) , who they hope to one day bring home from the central @entity247 country ' it 's not what we signed up for — adopting a child that old , ' @entity12 said of @entity3			0
' it will be harder for us			0
he will have bonding issues			0
but at least he 'll have love and support , a chance he 'll never have if he stays in that orphanage			0
' the @entity41 , the @entity260 and the other waiting families have an ardent well - wisher in the person of @entity195 , a 41 - year - old pediatric transport nurse from @entity264 , @entity265 , who was one of the nine members of the @entity26 65 able to complete her adoption last summer			1
@entity269 — a single mother now engaged to a long - time friend — says her 6 - year - old daughter , @entity196 , is developmentally delayed compared to other children her age , but is physically healthy and a joy to have around the house			0
@entity269 also adopted a boy from @entity278 in 2010 , and considers herself lucky , given that @entity278 in december banned further adoptions by @entity27 in retaliation for a @entity27 law targeting alleged @entity278 human - rights violators			1
@entity269 remains in touch with the families still waiting for @entity26 adoptions and yearns for their success			1
' my heart still bleeds for all of those kids , ' she said			0
' i 've seen them , i 've held them , i 've helped advocate for the last five years			1
' i see the huge improvements that @entity196 has made in six months that she would never have made in an institution , ' @entity269 added			0
' to know the others are not getting that attention is heartbreaking			0

corruption *plagues* the adoption system in the @entity30 , which halted adoptions in 2008
16 families remain in limbo , but are dedicated to the cause of completing the adoptions they began five years *ago*
