by @entity0 published : 15:13 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 15:13 est , 22 may 2013 lagging behind : @entity1 has been having trouble competing with other designer water brands , and it hopes to catch up with its sleek new bottle @entity1 is giving itself a facelift to keep up with its sleek , young competitors on store shelves			1
the water , which is owned by @entity11 food and beverage company @entity9 , is unveiling a new bottle for the first time in 14 years as it looks to reinvigorate its image and win back market share in the premium water category			0
instead of the contoured bottle that has long defined the brand , the new look has cleaner lines , reminiscent of the cylinder - like shape of the @entity24 bottle			1
@entity1 's makeover comes at a critical time , given the brand 's languishing sales performance in an industry where looks play such a big role			1
of course , premium waters such as @entity1 , @entity33 and @entity24 are able to command higher prices in large part because of the claims they make about how they 're sourced or processed			1
but the superficial factor is high , too : distinct bottle shapes set them apart and bestow a sense of status			0
' people buy these brands to display them , ' said @entity46 , editor of @entity47 , an industry tracker			0
' they do n't want a bottle that looks like it 's a private label product			2
' @entity1 , which is sourced from springs in the @entity50 , entered the @entity52 market in 1978 and for many years was synonymous with premium water			2
in recent years , however , it has lost market share with the rise of newer players such as @entity57 's @entity24 and @entity33 , which comes in rectangular bottles and is owned by @entity59 , the maker of @entity60			1
last year , @entity1 's sales volume rose just 0.4 percent , compared with a 19 per cent increase for @entity24 and a 4 per cent increase for @entity33 , according to @entity47			1
and its market share was just 0.3 per cent of the bottled water category , down from 1.2 per cent a decade earlier			0
@entity66 , president of @entity67 , noted that @entity1 's contoured bottle was original when it first arrived in the @entity52 but that it became more commonplace over the years as competitors imitated it			1
more recently , he said the trend has shifted toward cleaner lines			0
scroll for video before or after ? : the new @entity1 bottle is pictured at right , but it does n't look much different from the current design ' what the other waters did was put pressure on us to contemporize @entity1 , ' @entity66 said			1
' we realized that our bottle had become a little bit old and dated			0
' @entity1 's push to win over more customers comes as consumption of bottled water has surged over the past decade , with @entity52 cutting back on soda and other sugary drinks			1
but the bulk of that growth has come from more affordable waters , such as @entity90 's @entity89 and the smaller store brands that are typically sold in bulk cases at supermarkets			2
for major companies such as @entity95 and @entity96 , selling water in those big cases is n't as profitable as selling heavily marketed drinks like soda or sports drinks			0
premium waters are different , however , because people are willing to fork over more money for them too			0
@entity1 , for example , can cost between 20 per cent and 80 per cent more than other bottled waters depending on the package size , @entity66 said			1
the advantages of such premium waters are debatable , of course , with each brand 's popularity hinging on claims of what makes them unique			2
@entity1 's new labels , for example , will include a short explainer on the back that states " each drop filters through layers of mineral - rich glacial sands " in the @entity50			1
water babies : a popular ad campaign for the company featured babies dancing and roller skating in order to illustrate their ' live young ' image @entity33 , meanwhile , claims to be from an underground aquifer ' hundreds of feet below the edges of a rainforest			2
' and @entity24 boasts of being ' vapor distilled , ' meaning that @entity57 essentially puts tap water through a process that strips out the chemicals , then 're - @entity137 ' it to improve the taste			0
beyond the story lines of what makes their waters special , however , @entity1 's new bottle underscores the importance of appearances			1
in addition to the cleaner lines , the bottle will bear a label with a simplified logo that 's affixed like a sticker , rather than a wraparound label that 's held together by glue			2
but it will still have a blue tint and ridges at the top intended to evoke the @entity50			0
it debuts in the @entity52 next month , starting with the 330 ml and 500 ml bottles , with an online and print ad campaign set for july			0
@entity158 and @entity159 will get the new bottles toward the end of the summer			0
timing for @entity162 , including @entity11 , has n't yet been determined .			0

@entity1 's new bottle is reminiscent of the streamlined looks of @entity164 and @entity33 - two of @entity1 's main competitors
last year , @entity1 saw only *marginal* sales compared with other designer waters
