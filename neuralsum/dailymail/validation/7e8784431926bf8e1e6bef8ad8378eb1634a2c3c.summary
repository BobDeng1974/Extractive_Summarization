@entity5 captured the action on his helmet camera as he was hurtling down a slope on the @entity9 in the @entity10			1
at first , the 23 - year - old glides over the powder white snow , occasionally using his parachute to take off and land metres away			1
then , out of nowhere , an avalanche comes into shot and nearly sweeps him over the edge of the mountain			2
extreme skier @entity5 is seen on his helmet camera hurtling down a slope in the @entity10 moments before an avalanche sweeps across his path , nearly knocking him over the face of the 4,000m mountain danger : out of nowhere , the avalanche comes into shot from his left as he races down the slope averting disaster : mr @entity5 uses his parachute to lift several feet in the air to dodge the avalanche 's path the extreme skier sails over the path of the avalanche as it sweeps out of view but mr @entity5 uses his parachute to dodge its path and watches as the powder , ice and rocks drop hundreds of feet below him while he floats in the clear blue skies			1

' as mr @entity5 looks behind him , the avalanche can been seen tumbling over the edge of the cliff he watches as the powder , ice and rocks drop hundreds of feet below while he floats in the clear blue skies he said : ' once i was safely away from the cliff face , it was amazing to watch the snow falling below my feet ' mr @entity5 has been freeriding for six years and works as a ski instructor throughout the winter months			1
freeriding , or speed flying as it is also known , involves skiing off off - piste , often with a winged parachute , much like paragliding			2
sometimes referred to as ' off - piste ' , there is a much higher possibility of there being avalanches as the snow is less stable			0
mr @entity5 said : ' when i showed my friends the video , they were amazed			2
' some of them say i 'm crazy because of the dangers of freeriding but it just makes me feel alive			1
' i have been practicing for many years now so the risk of my rides is always carefully calculated			0
