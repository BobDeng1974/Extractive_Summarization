president @entity0 warned republicans in @entity2 on friday that he was prepared to act without them to plug financial holes in @entity5 's immigration infrastructure , which is increasingly burdened by a flood of children and teens slipping into the @entity5 from the south			1
' while they 're on vacation , i 'm going to have to make some tough choices to meet the challenge , with or without @entity2 , ' he said during a 45 - minute - long press conference at the @entity16			0
@entity0 's opening statements were entirely about domestic issues , but journalists in the room asked mostly about foreign policy , teeing up softballs about @entity24 's antagonism in @entity25 and the @entity28 - @entity27 conflict			2
' i thought you guys were going to ask me how i was going to spend my birthday , ' @entity0 said near the end of his appearance in the press briefing room			2
in turn , the president was most focused on needling his @entity46 opposition about their lack of enthusiasm for passing immigration legislation , saying he expects to ' act on my own to solve the problem ' while they are away from @entity65 for the next five weeks			1
citing ' 80 per cent ' of border issues on which he claimed ' there is agreement ' between @entity16 @entity46 leaders and his administration , he skewered his opposition for its intramural squabbling – most in evidence thursday night as warring @entity46 factions held a funding bill in limbo			1
that measure would have provided @entity0 with $ 659 million , a fraction of the $ 3.7 billion he has asked for			1
competing versions passed around the @entity46 caucus focused alternatively on funding to strengthen the border and an outright ban on any @entity16 efforts to expand the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) program , a 2012 mini-amnesty program for people brought to the @entity5 illegally as children			1
the result , said @entity0 is ' not a disagreement between me and the @entity92 ; it 's a disagreement between the @entity92 and the @entity93			1
' conservatives in the @entity16 @entity46 caucus are most worried about the possibility that @entity0 could unilaterally make a larger move than just rearranging @entity99 budgets : they fret about an executive expansion of @entity85 , and have pushed for any border bill to include an outright prohibition on the program 's growth			1
rep. @entity106 , a @entity107 @entity46 , summed up the situation on @entity109 by telling @entity110 that the conflict is ' insurmountable			0
' ' we are a completely wide spectrum ' of opinion , he said			0
' we 've got some members of the @entity92 , and maybe even in the @entity118 , that agree with @entity119 much more on this issue than @entity46			1
' ' but on top of that , you 've got a president who does what he wants – who ignores the law , enforces only parts that he wants – and we ca n't trust that he 'll do anything			0
' on thursday , @entity16 @entity46 leaders withdrew their own bill from consideration after it became clear that not enough @entity46 would support it in a vote			1
almost immediately , @entity16 adviser @entity133 presaged @entity0 's likely move to make a unilateral policy change			0
' by pulling their own bill , ' he tweeted , ' the @entity16 @entity46 once again proves why the president must act on his own to solve problems			1
' the @entity46 was set to give up but @entity16 speaker @entity139 and newly minted majority leader @entity140 brought boos and catcalls by announcing that they would delay the @entity143 for another day of wrangling			0
the most recent rewrite added $ 35 million for an increased @entity147 presence on the @entity5 - @entity149 border , but it 's unclear if that will be enough to cement a @entity46 coalition large enough to bring the measure to a vote – and then to an inevitable rejection in the @entity118			1
the game is a familiar one in @entity65 , with the two house of @entity2 controlled by opposing parties and trying their best to not be the chamber holding the legislative ball when the music stops before a month - long intermission			0
@entity139 spokesman @entity162 said friday that ' when it comes to the humanitarian crisis on our southern border , president @entity0 has been completely awol – in fact , he has made matter [ s ] worse by flip - flopping on the 2008 law that fueled the crisis			2
' ' @entity119 have left town without acting on his request for a border supplemental [ budget request ]			2
right now , @entity16 @entity46 are the only ones still working to address this crisis			0
' man of the hour : on his first day in a new leadership role			0
@entity140 rep. @entity140 had to tell a groaning @entity16 chamber that the august recess was delayed no drama : @entity0 seemed unflappable as he cautioned @entity46 against defying his immigration funding demands @entity0 has suggested he would veto any bill that denied his administration the funding he wants – most of which would grow programs that process and house the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children pouring across the border			1
less than 3 per cent of his funding proposal would beef up border security			2
but he insisted friday that a cash - strapped federal government would soon lack the means to respond to the current problem without @entity46 ' say - so			2
' we 've got to take action , ' he said , referring to his domestic policy team at the @entity16			0
' i 'm going to have to act alone because we do n't have the resources			0
we 've already been clear			0
we do n't have the money			0
... we 're going to have to reallocate some resources			0
' instead of writing him a blank check , @entity0 complained , the @entity46 's right wing has been steering the discussion toward solutions that are destined to meet his veto pen			1
' @entity92 as we speak are trying to pass the most extreme and unworkable version of a bill that they already know is going nowhere , that ca n't pass the @entity118 , ' the president said friday			2
' they 're not even trying to to solve the problem , ' he said			0
' this is a message bill ... just so they can check a box before leaving town tomorrow			0
' each side of the ideological aisle has accused the other of posturing for political gain as fundraising kicks into high gear for november 's congressional midterm elections			1
deluge : a flood of new illegal immigrants , mostly children and teens , has swept across the southwest @entity5 border in the two years since @entity0 announced a mini-amnesty for those who arrived unlawfully as children before 2007 in the @entity236 - controlled @entity118 , majority leader @entity235 failed thursday to advance a smaller $ 2.7 billion version of @entity0 's supplemental funding request , effectively killing it until september			1
the measure was killed on a 50 - 44 procedural vote , fully 10 votes shy of what was needed to stop debate and vote on the bill 's merits			0
several moderate @entity119 , including some facing tough re-election fights , voted ' no. ' @entity0 only briefly mentioned his usually foremost ' comprehensive immigration reform ' refrain , claiming that his preferred approach – a complete overhaul of @entity5 immigration policy – ' might have forestalled some of the problems we 're seeing now in the @entity255 with these undocumented children			1
' he has argued in the past that a rewrite of immigration law would give him the power to stop pursuing illegal immigrants who came as children – so - called @entity262 – and redirect those resources to more pressing problems at the border			2
but in teeing up @entity119 ' disgust with slow - moving @entity46 , he set the stage for an august recess full of recriminations about a ' do - nothing ' @entity46 @entity16			1
' if in fact @entity92 are concerned about me acting independently of @entity2 ... then the easiest way to solve it is – pass some legislation			0

president is angry at @entity92 for refusing to consider his $ 3.7 billion supplemental funding request
most of that ask would pay to care for thousands of illegal immigrant children , while just a few per cent would strengthen the @entity5 border
the @entity46 failed to build a consensus thursday on a *compromise* bill , but @entity0 said he would veto it regardless
as august congressional recess looms , a lack of action will mean *endless* political recriminations in advance of the november midterm elections
