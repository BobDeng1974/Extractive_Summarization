a teenager unable to hug his family for years for fear of the excruciating pain that came with being touched , has made a ' miracle ' breakthrough			1
@entity6 , 14 , would writhe in agony at an embrace with friends or family members , having been diagnosed with regional chronic pain syndrome ( @entity12 ) two years ago			1
the condition caused @entity6 to suffer persistent burning pain in his limbs forcing him to leave school and study at home			1
but today the teenager from @entity19 , near @entity20 in @entity21 is today back in the classroom for the first time in two years , thanks to a life - changing three - day course of treatment teaching him to retrain his brain			1
teenager @entity6 can hug his mother @entity29 , brother @entity30 and sisters @entity32 and @entity33 , after years of excruciating pain every time he was touched , thanks to a life - changing three - day treatment course teaching him to retrain his brain @entity6 has battled the debilitating condition as well as me , also known as chronic fatigue syndrome , and extreme hypermobility syndrome - both diagnosed when he was a child			1
countless @entity42 treatments and physiotherapy proved ineffective against @entity6 's rcps			1
but a specialist team at the @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity21 , offered the teenager a free three - day programme after his plight came to light in january			1
@entity6 's mother @entity51 , 38 , said since her son underwent the treatment he was ' got his life back ' , returning to school and finally able to enjoy hugs with his family			1
the 38 - year - old said : ' it 's like i 've got my son back again			1
it is nothing short of a miracle			0
' to be rid of the pain he felt every day after just a three - day course is absolutely amazing			2
' we walked the dog the other day which is something we have not done for at least 18 months and he asked " can i go for a run ? " ' i said " of course you can " with a big lump in my throat , ' said ms @entity51			2
' he came back and said " something has really changed			0
i do n't feel like i have just run a marathon "			0
' the mother - of - four said @entity6 has been for his first bike ride in two years and car journeys are no longer a traumatic endurance test			1
his mother @entity29 , said : '' it 's like i 've got my son back again			1
it is nothing short of a miracle ' since his treatment , @entity6 has stopped taking daily painkillers and medication			1
ms @entity51 said : ' i can now hug him - he can now hold his sisters ' hands , ' she added			1

mr @entity103 said : ' @entity6 has completed phase one : preparation and is about to embark on phase two : education and training			2
' he will learn about the brain - body connection , the physiology of stress , how the chronic stress response becomes established and how it impacts on various body systems			1
' stress hormones have a detrimental effect on the regulation of pain messages from the periphery to the brain			0
' they can also impact on the patient 's natural ability to release endorphins that sooth pain			0
' this creates a chaotic , vicious cycle			0
to create a healing cycle , @entity6 will learn strategies and techniques to use on a moment - by - moment basis			2
' he added : ' this will enable his brain and body to switch off the stress response and allow the proper regulation of pain messages and endorphins			0

i just want to live life and be happy			0
' complex regional pain syndrome is a rare and poorly understood condition , in which a person develops a persistent burning pain in one of their limbs			1
the pain usually develops after an injury but the pain experienced is out of all proportion to what you would expect			0
for example a sufferer may only strain their ankle but it can feel like a serious burn			0
the skin of the affected body part can become very sensitive and even the slightest touch , bump or change in temperature can provoke a feeling of intense pain			0
in some cases the pain passes after a few weeks			0
but others suffer the condition for months , and as in @entity6 's case , years			2
there are three treatment options available			0
- physical therapy , including physiotherapy to help improve a sufferer 's range of movement - medication , such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like @entity195 to relieve pain - counselling and support to help people cope better emotionally with the impact of living with chronic pain source : @entity203			1
