by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 18:30 est , 26 february 2013 a mother who kidnapped her two children and fled to @entity3 after complaining her husband spent more time playing cricket than he did with her has won the right to take them to live abroad permanently			1
the @entity3 - born dental nurse abducted the couple 's children , aged four and five , when her marriage broke down , taking them from their home in @entity14 to @entity15 without telling her @entity17 sports masseur husband			1
now a judge at @entity20 's @entity19 has ruled that the children should live in @entity3 , despite the ' abysmal ' and ' cruel ' way the 34 - year - old woman had treated their father when she disappeared to the other side of the world with his young family			1
' selfish ' : a judge ruled the children should live in @entity3 with her mother , despite the ' abysmal ' way she had treated their father in a judgement made public today , mr @entity32 said in the interests of the children - who can not be named for legal reasons - he had decided not to punish their mother for her ' high handed , selfish and autocratic ' conduct , and to ' shut out his strong feelings of sympathy ' for the youngsters ' father			1
the woman 's estranged husband , 33 , has agreed to move from @entity14 to @entity3 - where the judge noted he could still pursue his passion for cricket - following the outcome of the case			1
the judge told how the @entity3 born mother became ' miserable ' and complained that her husband , a member of a local cricket club , spent more time with playing sport than he did with her			1
there days after her husband asked for a divorce , the woman took the couple 's children to her parents home in @entity15			1
the judge told how the couple met in @entity62 in 2001 while they were both on holiday , and renewed their acquaintance when the mother was travelling in the @entity17			1
they lived together at the home of the man 's parents in the @entity17 for the first half of 2005 before the woman returned to @entity3			1
the man then moved in with her in @entity3 at the end of 2005 and the pair got married in the country in april 2006			2
after returning to @entity78 in july 2010 the couple moved in with the husband 's parents once again , before renting their own flat in the town from january 2011			0
but in may 2011 the woman ' went home ' to @entity3 without telling her husband			1
the ensuing legal battle saw the children ' subjected to two years of uncertainty ' ahead of the @entity19 's ruling			2
' this was an open and shut case of child abduction , ' mr @entity32 said			1
kidnapped : it was an ' open and shut case of child abduction ' when the woman took the children to @entity3 without telling their father , a judge said it led to protracted court proceedings in @entity3 where the mother battled to keep her children in @entity15 while their father fought to have them returned to @entity104			1
in july last year the mother dropped her defence and in august after 15 months in @entity3 the father brought them back to live in @entity104			1
she returned to @entity104 in december and applied for a relocation order to take them back permanently to live in @entity3			1
the judge said the decision he had to make ' is exceptionally difficult as the merits each way are evenly balanced '			0
he added : ' but in a way the decision i have to make is not as heart - rending as is the case in so many of these relocation disputes			0
' this is because the parents have agreed that whatever i decide there will be shared care			0
i will have to decide in which country the children should live and in the light of that decision the unsuccessful parent will travel to live in that country			2
' this is to the very great credit of the parents , who each is prepared to put his or her interests beneath those of the children , ' the judge said			2
' these children will grow up enjoying the society of each of their parents and will not be confined , like so many children in these relocation disputes , only to occasional direct contact with the non-residential parent			0
' the judge said that the father ' accepted that he retained friends in @entity3 although these had dwindled to few in number '			1
he added that the man would be able to continue to pursue his ' principal recreational interest ' of cricket in @entity3			2
in finding in favour of the children returning to @entity3 the judge said he found the father to be ' honest and fair '			1
ruling : the judge said the father intended to move to @entity15 , in @entity3 , to be close to his children following the outcome of the case at @entity20 's @entity19 while the father described his wife 's apology as insincere and ' manipulative ' the judge said she had eventually shown ' remorse ' and apologised for her actions			1
' however , it must be possible for the scales to fall from the eyes of someone in the wrong ; for her to recognise her wrongdoing ; and to seek redemption , ' the judge said			0
' i judge the mother to have been sincere ( up to a point ) in her remorse and apology , and at last to have recognised that her behaviour was very poor indeed			1
' he added : ' i am therefore prepared to give the mother the benefit of the doubt			0
i very much hope that the faith that i place in her will not prove false			0
she should have no doubt that if that faith is breached she will likely lose the shared care of the children			0
mr @entity32 said he regarded the children 's father as ' highly competent and self - sufficient '			1
he said the children 's ' physical , emotional and educational needs are much the same whether they are in @entity78 or @entity15 '			1
the judge continued : ' the decision that i make is based from first to last on the interests of these children			2
i must shut out my strong feelings for sympathy for the father at the high - handed , selfish and autocratic way he has been treated by the mother , and i must eschew any temptation to punish the mother for that conduct			2
' he said the couple had decided to divorce in whichever country they live in , which would now be @entity3			2
but before leaving the case he said : ' finally , i would repeat what i have said before			0
child abduction seldom , if ever , has a happy ending			0
it has rightly been described as a form of child abuse			0
' the mother 's conduct was abysmal			2
it was an act of deliberate cruelty to her husband , the father of her children			2
it was directly contrary to the interests of the children for them abruptly to have been removed from the society of their father			0
' it has subjected them to two years of uncertainty while they have been taken across the world , back and forth			0
it has embroiled all members of the family in extensive litigation with days in court in both countries			0
' it has brought the mother to the brink of bankruptcy			0
yet it has not been until very recently that the mother has developed any self - awareness			0
her attitude was " i did not abduct them ; i just took them home "			0
' this is an all too common attitude but it is as misguided as it is futile			0
if the place to which the children are taken is a subscriber to the @entity259 then the children will almost inevitably be returned with all the delay and heartbreak that this case has demonstrated			0
had the mother behaved correctly and made an application for relocation in 2011 then i expect it would likely have been granted , and all that trauma avoided , ' the judge said .			0
