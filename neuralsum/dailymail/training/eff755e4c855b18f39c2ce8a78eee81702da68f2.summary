the firm behind the e-joint , called @entity8 , claims it will provide all the relaxing and pain - killing effects of marijuana , without the high			1
the product has been engineered to contain cannabidiol ( @entity14 ) , a compound in cannabis which has therapeutic uses as a painkiller			1
but , crucially , the product does not contain @entity20 , another psychoactive compound found in cannabis , which causes the ‘ high ’			1
it claims the e-joint , called @entity8 , will provide all the relaxing and painkilling effects of marijuana , without the high , as it does not contain the psychoactive ingredient @entity20 cannabis - derived drugs such as @entity32 are already used in the @entity33 , @entity34 and other @entity36 countries to treat the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and cancer ‘ @entity40 brings you many of the benefits of cannabinoids without the psychotic effect of @entity20 ’ , its makers claim , writing on their website			1

two other cannabis - derived drugs , @entity51 and @entity52 , are also used in @entity53 and the @entity33 to treat the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and @entity57 - related anorexia			2
the founders of @entity8 , @entity64 , a start up entrepreneur and @entity60 , an agricultural engineer , spent two years extracting legal cannabinoids and developing the product , @entity58 reports			2
it is made from the hemp version of the plant , grown legally in @entity5 , which contains more cbd and only 0.2 per cent @entity20 , which is not enough for recreational users of cannabis			1
mr @entity64 , who previously worked in start - up companies in the @entity33 where he said it was possible to earn a ‘ comfortable salary ’ , said he quit his job and set up @entity40 as he wanted to help people suffering conditions that could be eased by marijuana			2
he realised many people in @entity5 suffer from cancer or @entity80 , and said it was an ‘ injustice ’ they could not use cannabis to ease their pain			1
he said : ‘ one of them said " cannabis plant helps me to fight against my illness , however , the legislation that i have to put myself in situations of illegality			0
i therefore can not provide myself with cannabis legally , i can not find quality cannabis			0

mr @entity64 is launching his product amid a blazing debate over whether e-cigarettes should be regulated			0
some experts argue they are safer than smoking traditional tobacco , whose bouquet of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer , heart disease and strokes			0
but the @entity125 has called for them to be banned in public places , and their sale to vulnerable groups like minors and pregnant women regulated , as not enough research has been carried out into their long - term use			0
