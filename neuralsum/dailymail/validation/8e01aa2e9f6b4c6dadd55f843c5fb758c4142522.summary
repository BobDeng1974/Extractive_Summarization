doctors stress the importance of detecting disease early on to give people the best chance of recovery			1
and in the very near future you could get these early warning signs using just your smartphone			2
a @entity11 firm has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person ’s breath that could hint at an underlying illness			1
doctor in a stick ? the very early model of the sensor ( pictured ) has been created by @entity11 - based @entity22 and is on display at this year ’s @entity24 in @entity25 advanced software and prediction algorithms are then used with a connected app to reveal any anomalies			1
the very early model of the sensor has been created by @entity11 - based @entity22 and is on display at this year ’s @entity24 in @entity25			1
endogenous volatile organic compounds ( @entity33 ) are released either through everyday metabolic activity , or by diseases in the body			0
once created , they travel into the blood and are released in urine or breath			0
in addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath , the firm said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food some compounds , including carbon for instance , are released naturally			1
@entity22 has therefore developed software that can identify at which point the level of a gas or compound is beyond what is considered normal			1
it uses predictive algorithms to then convert the data so that patients and doctors can understand what the results mean			0
it is hoped that complex processing will prevent needless worry or give a false reading that suggests they are ill. if the sensor is added to a smartphone , for example , a patient could record their breath and the results could be sent to their doctor automatically			2
in particular , the sensors build on current breath gas analysers that are used to detect early signs of diabetes and even lung cancer			2
in addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath , mr @entity80 said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food			2
in the @entity89 demo , the @entity22 sensor was able to detect an orange within 30 seconds @entity22 ’s boss @entity80 gave @entity89 a demo of the technology at @entity24			1
the current sensor is a prototype and syncs with a smartphone via @entity98 - although mr @entity80 hopes future models will be embedded into the phones themselves			1
it takes around a minute to normalise and stabilise , a process needed to ensure that any readings are not contaminated by previous ‘ sniffs ’			0
this process is expected to be much faster on a finalised version , however			0
for the demo , the sensor is then placed inside a jar containing molecules released by oranges			0
within about 30 seconds the sensor beeped to say it had recognised the molecules and a picture of an orange appeared on the connected smartphone			0
this was a simplified way of demonstrating its capabilities , but mr @entity80 explained that the compounds released by oranges and vanilla - another jar in the demo - were complex enough to show its potential			0
if attached to a smartphone , the sensor could be placed in a fridge or cupboard and detect if chicken is nearing its best - before date , or if fruit and vegetables are about to turn			1
mr @entity80 said : ‘ i am excited to help lead in the creation of the first multi-bio sensing platform that detects and analyses biosignatures anywhere , anytime			2
this platform will improve the way consumers manage their wellness			0
@entity22 aims to be the world leader in solutions and services that enable and transform the way people gather and manage their biosignature analytics			0

the technology has been developed by @entity22
it recognises and analyses gases for so - called biosignatures
gases on the breath , for example , can be early *indicators* of disease
sensor could also reveal if food in your fridge is near its sell - by date
*inventor* hopes to add the technology to future @entity172 he said sensors could be ready by the end of this year
