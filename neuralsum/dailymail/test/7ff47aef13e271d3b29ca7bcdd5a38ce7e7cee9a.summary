@entity1 ’s international airport has been forced to hire porters to carry passengers ’ luggage up 32 stairs because a multi-million pound construction project did n’t budget for an escalator			1
a new metro line extension opened this week in the @entity10 capital – transporting travellers closer to the airport than ever before – but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses does n’t have a moving staircase			1
that means porters are left to carry travellers ’ heavy bags up and down the steep stairs at @entity23 station , in north - west @entity1 , from 5am to 10pm every day , free of charge			2
’ without a direct train connection , the no 119 bus takes passengers on the final five miles between @entity43 and the nearest metro station			1
more than three million airport customers use the bus every year , choosing not to go by car or risk being ripped off by one of @entity1 ’s notorious cab drivers			0
the 20billion koruna ( £ 527million , $ 787million ) metro extension , planned by the @entity51 , was supposed to transform @entity23 station into a transport hub for the airport , with passengers transferring to trains , not buses			1
travellers can use a lift , but they are forced to cross a busy road to access the bus terminal but the project is unfinished and the escalator that was constructed connects with an unbuilt train station			1
@entity64 , a spokesman for the airport , told @entity66 that the public transit authority is responsible for building a new escalator			0
he said the airport is in talks with transit officials and a private company regarding the refurbishment of buses that stop at the airport and better signage at the metro station			2
he added : ‘ costs for [ porters ] are in tens of thousands of @entity10 crowns per month but for @entity43 it is primarily an investment into the comfort and quality of service rather than cost only			0
’ @entity83 , a spokesman for the @entity51 , told @entity37 that the train project is delayed and ‘ it became impossible ’ to change the original plan to include an escalator for those transferring from the metro station to the bus terminal			2
he added : ‘ we do n’t feel it is a mistake of the transport company			0
’ an escalator was built for airport customers but it connects the metro station and an unbuilt train station the new extension allows passengers to travel between central @entity1 and the airport in 30 minutes , including the bus ride			1
officials are now considering adding an escalator while it remains unclear when the train project will be completed			0
travellers can use a lift located at another part of the metro station , but it is not a seamless transfer			0
once they arrive on the surface they are forced to cross a busy road to enter the bus terminal .			0

@entity1 's new metro extension transports travellers closer to the airport
they are forced to transfer to buses to travel the final five miles
but they must climb a set of stars because there is no escalator to buses
an escalator was constructed but it leads to an unbuilt train station
