to mark its one month anniversary of joining @entity11 monday , the spy agency gave another display of its new - found humor by answering some of the more pressing questions its 668,000 followers have asked in the past 30 days			1
no these were n't about @entity18 , or intelligence about @entity21 bombs , the @entity4 dished the dirt on rappers , passwords and whether you could score a job at the sort - after @entity29 headquarters			1
' no we do n't know where @entity5 is , ' one of a stream of @entity11 posts read monday			2
another read : ' no , we do n't know your password , so we ca n't send it to you			0
# sorrynotsorry ' the @entity4 then apologized for not following back @entity39 , but added to the talkshow star , ' if you visit us maybe we can take a selfie ? ' another revealed that ' @entity44			1
we 're hiring ' for those keen to join the ranks			0
the @entity4 entered the @entity47 last month in the tongue - in - cheek fashion that it has clearly upheld			1
such an approach to public relations is rare for government departments or agencies , particularly the covert @entity4			2
the spy agency 's first foray took the social network by storm as it poked fun at its secrecy			1
' we can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet , ' the @entity4 tweeted			2
the tweet was retweeted more than 300,000 times			0

@entity66 : to mark its one month anniversary of joining @entity11 monday , the spy agency gave another display of its new - found humor by answering some of the more pressing questions its 668,000 followers have asked in the past 30 days sorry : the @entity4 then apologized for not following back @entity39 , but added to the talkshow star , ' if you visit us maybe we can take a selfie ? ' come join us : another revealed that ' @entity44			1
we 're hiring ' for those keen to join the ranks			0
joining the social media world was intended to make the agency more accessible to the public			2
on july fourth , it had another interesting tweet			0
the spy agency helped solved what was a strange series of mysterious @entity90 sightings in @entity91 around the 1950s			1
at the time @entity92 documented what they believed were alien spacecrafts soaring across the sky			0
but thanks to one tweet , the @entity4 have explained exactly what was happening			0
' do you remember the reports of unusual activity in the sky in the 50 's ? that was us , ' the @entity11 said			2
attached to the tweet was a government writeup about the sightings , showing that they were actually test flights of @entity111 reconnaissance planes			0
makes sense : there were a series of @entity90 sightings in @entity92 in the 1950s			0
but with one post on @entity11 , the @entity4 have explained them , saying they were merely testings of @entity120 reconnaissance planes , such as the one pictured the @entity4 tweets an explaination for some @entity90 sightings in the 1950s , complete with an official document the planes flew above 60,000 feet , which was n't thought possible at the time , so commercial pilots who saw something so far above them could n't explain it			1
the effect was more pronounced at different times of the day and night , and if the @entity111 planes caught the rays of the sun , people on the ground were able to see silvery glints of light			0
the explanation was kept classified for decades to keep the spy programme a secret from the @entity142 during the @entity143 , according to the @entity144			0
it is yet another tweet that caused a social media from the @entity4 since they joined @entity11 .			1
