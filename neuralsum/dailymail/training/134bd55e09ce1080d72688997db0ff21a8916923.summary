these heartwarming pictures show seven - year - old mother @entity1 cuddling her new - born at @entity3 in @entity4			1
the people of @entity6 are celebrating the first baby panda born in the country in 24 years			1
the birth was captured on night vision webcam and a video was quickly released by @entity3 showing @entity1 giving birth and holding the tiny baby to her chest			2
it is the first panda to be born after being conceived naturally in @entity6 history			1
the task is extremely difficult task as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours over the entire year and can only become pregnant during a 24 hour slot			0
in the wild female pandas normally have a cub every two or three years			0
the unnamed cub is too young to have gained the characteristic black marks and its size is not living up to the name of @entity35 the unnamed baby panda caused a stir even before it was born			2
when it was announced last week that @entity1 was pregnant @entity6 governor @entity38 suggested @entity1 ’s baby be named @entity41 or @entity42 – a wordplay on the disputed @entity44 which are part of @entity6 but are claimed by both @entity46 and @entity47			1
the giant panda is threatened by loss of habitat , poaching and a low reproduction rate			0
females in the wild normally have a cub once every two to three years			0
only about 1,600 pandas live in the wild , mostly in @entity47 's southwestern @entity59 province			0
around 300 live in captivity mostly in @entity47 breeding centres and zoos but also in foreign zoos around the world			0
@entity47 ’s policy on panda export is very strict in order to protect their national symbol			0
a panda is never sold to a foreign country , but is instead on loan for a yearly fee of up to £ 650,000			0
there is also a clause that any cubs born during the loan belong to the @entity47 and have to be returned within two years			1
he got a quick response from @entity80 spokesman @entity79 regarding the islands , known to the @entity47 as the @entity44			0
speaking at a press conference in the capital last friday he said : ‘ @entity38 ’s scheme to undermine @entity47 - @entity6 relations is a clumsy performance			2
it will only tarnish the image of @entity6 and @entity4 , ’ ‘ no matter what names the @entity6 side gives , it can not change the fact that the two pandas belong to @entity47			1
‘ likewise , what names @entity6 gives to the @entity44 and the adjacent isles , it can not change the fact that these islands belong to @entity47			2
’ the zoo 's panda team , comprised of five workers and four veterinarians , will continue using two cameras to observe the pair 24 hours a day for about a week , and have been joined by a breeding expert from @entity59 , @entity47 , where @entity1 grew up			1
visitors to the zoo eager to see the baby will be disappointed as @entity3 , which is the oldest in @entity6 , has expressed wishes to keep the cub and mother away from the public for another six months			0
@entity1 and her mate , @entity115 , are on loan from @entity47 for 10 years			1
under the terms of the agreement between @entity6 and @entity47 , the cub will be sent back in two years			2
just the two of us : the cub is the first to be born in @entity6 in 24 years and will no be displayed to the public for six months			1

first panda born in @entity6 in 24 years and first ever to be conceived naturally in the country
prior to its birth it caused *political* *scandal* as @entity6 governor suggested naming it after disputed islands both @entity6 and @entity47 lay claim to
as with all giant pandas in captivity outside @entity47 the baby and its mother @entity1 is on loan and will eventually be returned
