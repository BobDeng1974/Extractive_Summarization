@entity1 ’s devastating start to their @entity3 title defence is now a distant memory after they crashed to a 20 - 16 defeat against @entity6 at @entity7			1
as an otherwise dull contest entered its final quarter , @entity10 ’ 9 - 3 lead built on three penalties from @entity13 was transformed into a 17 - 9 deficit			1
tries from flanker @entity15 and wing @entity16 in two minutes placed @entity6 in a commanding position in a match where every point was a battleground			1
@entity6 flanker @entity15 escapes the tackle of @entity1 's @entity13 @entity15 crosses for the first of @entity6 ' two tries as they upset @entity1 20 - 16 at @entity7 full - back @entity26 crossed with two minutes remaining to salvage a bonus point as a late surge from @entity10 was repelled			1
for @entity1 it was an almighty comedown after the reigning champions had routed @entity32 53 - 6 nine days ago , scoring eight tries in the process			1
they failed to capitalise on a glut of possession and were devoid of ideas with gamebreakers such as @entity40 and @entity41 barely involved			0
@entity6 , who saw @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 contribute points from the kicking tee , were worthy winners and will draw enormous confidence from the result			0
it was a hard watch at times , most noticeably in a grim first half that began with @entity13 and @entity43 exchanging penalties			2
@entity1 had spent most of the opening quarter trying to breach a robust home defence but while they had plenty of ball , the gaps were not appearing			0
winger @entity16 crosses for @entity6 second try within two minutes as they claim the lead @entity16 celebrates his try as @entity6 claim victory over the @entity3 defending champions @entity43 was marginally wide with a long - range penalty and a half that was passing without event produced fireworks at a 30th - minute line - out			1
@entity15 took out @entity69 and as the two lay on the floor the @entity71 loosehead threw a punch			0
after consulting the @entity76 , referee @entity75 issued yellow cards to both players			0
@entity13 kicks one of this three penalties the pressure should have increased on the home whitewash when @entity10 won a five - metre scrum , but @entity6 responded by forcing the penalty			1
on the next phase of play @entity6 attacked with purpose for the first time , @entity85 , @entity16 and @entity86 making yards until full - back @entity87 was penalised for holding on to the ball			1
any excitement quickly subsided as the match continued its uneventful path			0
with the score so tight points were at a premium , so @entity1 must have cursed when @entity13 struck the right upright with a very kickable penalty			2
@entity102 had to wait until the 49th minute for his first touch of the ball , but the @entity76 intervened to deny him a try for being in front of @entity109 when the wing chipped ahead			0
successive penalties from @entity13 appeared to give @entity10 some breathing space but that lasted only until @entity6 plundered two quickfire tries			1
the first came when @entity15 picked off @entity41 ’s pass intended for @entity102 and won the race to the right corner			0
before they had the chance to compose themselves @entity10 conceded a second after a piece of magic from @entity16			2
@entity6 worked the ball to their left wing and with little space to exploit he chipped ahead , gathered the kick and dived over			0
replacement fly - half @entity44 landed both conversions , but then had to be helped from the pitch with what appeared to be a significant injury			0
but @entity45 picked up where @entity44 left off by landing a penalty that swept @entity6 out of reach with @entity26 ’s late try proving too little , too late .			2

@entity15 and @entity16 scored for @entity6 to take control
@entity1 full back @entity26 crossed with two minutes to play
@entity13 kicked three penalties and converted @entity26 's try
@entity10 ' last outing was a 53 - 6 *trouncing* of @entity32
