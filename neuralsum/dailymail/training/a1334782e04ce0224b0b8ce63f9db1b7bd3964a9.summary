mr @entity0 ruled that boy , two , should be allowed to stay close to his biological father as he is likely to struggle with his identity as he grows up a woman trying to move to @entity5 with her @entity7 son has been barred from taking the boy abroad so he can be close to his @entity9 father			1
the father , a dance instructor in his 40s , is the boy 's only biological parent because the child was conceived using his sperm and an egg donated by another woman			1
the woman , a specialist asset manager in her 50s , had been trying to take the two - year - old to @entity5 to find work , but the father objected			1
giving his ruling today , senior family division judge mr. justice @entity24 said the boy would likely start to grapple with his identity in the coming years , and needed his biological father around in order to help			1
the couple , who can not be named for legal reasons , lived in @entity31 and first met in 2007 when she was married to somebody else			0
she got a divorce from her partner in 2009 , and while the new couple never married , they decided to try for a child using @entity7 treatment			1
the baby boy was born in august 2012 , but the pair split just a year later			2
she currently has custody of the child , while the father is able to visit			2
mr @entity0 said when the boy became older he would need his father in case he struggled with the knowledge he is not related to his mother by blood			2
he added : ' it is a fact he will have to grapple with , probably in six or seven years time			0
he will at that point learn that his mother is not related to him , except by law			0
' it is his mother â€™s inability to recognise the value to the boy of having his father in his life which has weighed with me , along with the inevitable harm to him especially given the history of his conception and the value of having his father in his life when he is struggling with that part of his identity			2
' the mother said she needed to move back to @entity5 to find work , but the judge dismissed her concerns , saying he was satisfied she could get a job in @entity9			1
mr @entity0 said the father has the greater claim as he is the boy 's only biological parent			1
the child was conceived using the father 's sperm and donor eggs , meaning he has none of his mother 's dna he added : ' i have no doubt that this mother will be disappointed			1
but she is a resilient character			0
i have no doubt that she will turn her shoulder to the wheel			0
' @entity7 treatment using donor eggs is usually recommended for post-menopausal women , those whose reproductive organs have been damaged , or those who have had repeated miscarriages			0
the egg , which is taken from an anonymous donor , is fertilised using the father 's sperm and is then typically inserted into the mother using traditional ivf techniques			1
up to two of the best - quality embryos will be inserted directly into her womb which has been prepared using hormone treatment			0
the rest may be frozen to use again , should the first try fail			0
the legal mother then carries the child to term and gives birth to it , but will not be related to it biologically			0
the process has a success rate of between 25 and 40 per cent .			0

@entity127 , in his 40s , and mother , in her 50s , had baby in 2012 using @entity7
