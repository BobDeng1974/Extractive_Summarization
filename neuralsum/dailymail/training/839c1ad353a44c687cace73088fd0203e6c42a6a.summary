by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 16:14 est , 20 november 2013 @entity3 spies were allowed to analyse the emails and phone records of potentially millions of @entity6 after being given permission by @entity9 's @entity8 , it has been claimed			1
the government allowed the @entity11 to store information regarding @entity14 's landline numbers and later data regarding mobile phone and email communications and internet use			1
according to @entity21 , documents leaked by fugitive @entity11 whistleblower @entity20 , show that the @entity11 was given the go ahead to ' unminimise ' @entity6 landline telephone numbers from as early as 2004 in a 2007 agreement meaning that the agency was not required to delete the files and could analyse them			1
agreement : the @entity11 , whose @entity29 headquarters are pictured , were allowed to analyse landline phone records from 2004 , according to claims by @entity21 @entity33 claims : while top secret @entity3 document said it would only spy with the permission of @entity37 ( pictured ) , another draft memo said it would analyse communications ' unilaterally ' documents from 2005 that were circulated to the @entity6 's own intelligence service @entity37 outlines how @entity3 would target @entity6 citizens ' with the full knowledge and co-operation of @entity37 '			1
the @entity11 said that it would monitor communications in the ' best interest of the @entity3 '			0
but a second document , a draft memo marked ' @entity47 ' which means it is not for release even to @entity6 eyes , says how the @entity11 was prepared to spy on @entity6 communications ' unilaterally ' and without the @entity6 government 's permission			2
deal : the alleged agreement with @entity3 intelligence services took place while @entity9 was prime minister the two documents contain different wording and contain different circulation lists			0
both the @entity3 and @entity6 authorities have declined to comment on what happened to the draft memo			0
according to @entity21 , it could be that if a @entity6 citizen sent a circular email to a terror suspect and everyone else in his or her contacts book , then details of everyone on that list would be monitored			2
the revelations appear to fly in the face of an agreement signed between the two countries in 1946 that the nations would share intelligence on foreign countries but not spy on each other			0
that agreement was later expanded to include five @entity82 - speaking nations and became known as the ' five - eyes ' agreement			0
@entity85 took over as foreign secretary in 2006 and still held the role a year later when the @entity3 and @entity6 made the alleged agreement			2
@entity21 attempted to contact both of them regarding the @entity20 documents and both declined to comment			1
it is unclear whether @entity6 intelligence services received anything in return as part of the agreement			0
@entity100 attempted to contact a spokesman for the @entity102 but is yet to receive any response			0
whistleblower : the documents seen by @entity21 were leaked by @entity3 fugitive @entity20 no comment : @entity89 , left , was foreign secretary until 2006 before @entity85 , right , took over the post			1

@entity21 claims to have seen documents from @entity11 whistleblower @entity20
the @entity11 was ' given the go - ahead to analyse @entity6 landline numbers from 2004 '
that agreement ' extended to mobile phones , emails and internet use later on '
