insane : @entity0 is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia according to two psychologists @entity3 gunman @entity0 could avoid prison after two psychologists found he was insane during his july 22 massacre			1
if a court agrees with that assessment , the self - declared @entity8 militant can not be sentenced to prison but will be subjected to compulsory psychiatric care , prosecutors told reporters in @entity14			1
' the conclusions of the forensic experts is that @entity0 was insane , ' prosecutor @entity15 said , adding @entity0 was in a state of psychosis during @entity3 's worst peacetime massacre			1
in @entity3 , an insanity defense requires that a defendant be in a state of psychosis while committing the crime with which he or she is charged			0
that means the defendant has lost contact with reality to the point that he 's no longer in control of his own actions			0
the 243 - page report will be reviewed by a panel from the @entity36 , which could ask for additional information and add its own opinions			2
the head of that panel told had reporters in july that it was unlikely that @entity0 would be declared legally insane because the attacks were so carefully planned and executed			2
@entity0 last month admitted killing 77 people , including eight in a bombing in central @entity14			2
but the 32 - year - old right - wing extremist denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save @entity3 and @entity48			1
disturbing : police and rescue groups recover some of the last remaining bodies from @entity52 after @entity0 , posing as a police officer , shot dead 69 during a rampage at a youth camp devastation : smoke billows from a 17 - storey government building after @entity0 's bomb rocked central @entity14 on july 22 killing eight people the two psychiatrists , in their report , concluded that @entity0 lived in his ' own delusional universe where all his thoughts and acts are guided by his delusions '			1
in a rambling manifesto posted on the internet before the attacks , @entity0 wrote that his arrest would open ' the propaganda phase ' of his operation to ignite a war to defend @entity48 against a supposed @entity76 takeover			2

sixty - nine people were killed on @entity52 before @entity0 surrendered to a police @entity101			1
the carnage left @entity3 shocked and continues to haunt a nation that sees itself as peaceful and tolerant			0

in it , he lays out a blueprint for a multi-phase revolution , targeting left - leaning political elites he accuses of destroying their own societies by admitting large numbers of immigrants , especially from @entity76 countries			0
his actions were widely condemned , including by the @entity119 bloggers and groups that he cited prolifically in the document			0
