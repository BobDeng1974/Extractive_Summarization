first , many parents decided to avoid giving their children the @entity3 jab because of alleged - and now disproven - links to autism			2
now , the rejection of vaccines seems to be catching on with pet owners , potentially putting animals at risk			1
among the jabs that they are refusing , are canine distemper and parvovirus , which can both prove fatal , @entity16 reported			1
however , it is illegal for owners not to protect their pets from rabies			1
a number of vets in the @entity23 have noticed a trend for people who are reluctant to vaccinate their pets			1
among the jabs that owners are refusing , are those for canine distemper and parvovirus , which can both prove fatal			1
a stock image of a dog being given a jab is shown @entity33 has asked a handful of @entity36 organisations if there is a similar trend in the @entity36			2
@entity39 , president of the @entity40 , is one of the experts who have seen pet owners skipping vaccinations			2
the fewer animals that are being vaccinateed for canine distemper , ( pictured ) , the greater the chance of a ' firestorm ' , one vet said ‘ the fewer animals that are getting the vaccine [ for canine distemper ] , the greater the likelihood that you ’re going to have a firestorm if something that is that highly communicable comes along , ’ he said			1
blog posts advocating skipping jabs , claim they can cause arthritis , cancers and epilepsy among other diseases , but these claims are largely unproven			2
writing in an article for @entity65 , dr @entity66 said : ' part of the drive for reconsideration of vaccine protocols has been coming from holistic veterinary practitioners , many of whom believe that repeated vaccinations diminish the animal 's immune resources and can actually create disorders such as degenerative joint diseases , immune mediated disorders such as @entity80 , and can actually depress the animal 's ability to ward off diseases " naturally "			0
' a few holistic veterinarians believe that all vaccines are harmful			0
' @entity86 , a blogger and past president of the @entity88 , told the magazine that the trend for ignoring vaccinations may be because views about human medicine have spilled over into the veterinary world			0
it is thought that more dogs are suffering from canine distemper , which causes potentially fatal respiratory and gastrointestinal problems , but there are no national statistics to support anecdotal evidence			1
computer artwork of canine parvovirus is pictured canine distemper is a viral disease that affects dogs and racoons , for example			1
in dogs , it attaches the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts as well as the spinal cord and brain			0
symptoms include : high fever , eye inflammation , laboured breathing , vomiting and diarrhoea , loss of appetite and lethargy , and hardening of nose and footpads			0
it 's caused by an rna virus from the same family of the virus that causes measles in humans			1
it 's highly contagious via inhalation and fatal half the time			1
canine parvovirus is spread by direct or indirect contact with dog faeces			1
symptoms appear within three and seven days , including : lethargy , fever , vomiting and diarrhoea , which can lead to dogs getting dehydrated and anaemic			0
if the virus progresses , white blood cell levels fail , resulting in shock and even death			0
‘ over the last 10 or 15 years there has been an increase in mostly unfounded concerns about vaccine safety for people - and that , i think , has raised people ’s awareness and level of concern about vaccinations for their pets , ’ he said			2
unlike with children , no agency tracks how many pets get their recommended vaccinations , so no - one knows how bad the problem may be if a nasty disease was to sweep a city ’s parks			0
it 's thought that more dogs are suffering from canine distemper , which causes potentially fatal respiratory and gastrointestinal problems , but there are no national statistics to support anecdotal evidence			1
some vets advocating alternative medicine even advise avoiding vaccinations			0
@entity180 , a homeopathic veterinarian in @entity181 , reportedly recommends taking puppies more than 12 weeks old – whose immune systems are fully formed - to the park to play with other animals instead of getting them vaccinated against canine distemper			1
this advice seems to echo that of parents who take their unvaccinated children to ‘ pox parties ’ in the hope that by mixing with others who have chickenpox or measles , for example , their children may build up natural immunity			0
other vets claim that it is impossible to introduce a puppy to an environment in order to pick up a disease without putting the dog , or other animals , at risk			0
a spokesman for the @entity210 and @entity211 told @entity33 : ‘ vaccinations are an extraordinary tool in our armoury in the fight against diseases , both in animals and humans			0
' under the @entity220 owners have a duty to protect their animals from pain , injury , suffering and disease			2
we know of no better , and scientifically proven , way to protect against disease than vaccination			0
sadly , we know from the @entity3 vaccine in children that scaremongering can lead to a loss of public confidence in vaccination and knee - jerk reactions that can lead to outbreaks of disease			0
' distemper and parvo virus are still killers – and the reason we no longer see these on a wider scale is because most owners sensibly choose to vaccinate			2

some vets in the @entity23 have noticed a trend for people not vaccinating pets
owners are refusing canine distemper and parvovirus jabs
this may be because of *rumoured* links to serious *health* conditions
some vets say a rejection of vaccines in humans may be spreading
it 's thought more dogs are suffering from potentially fatal canine distemper
but there are no national statistics to support anecdotal evidence
