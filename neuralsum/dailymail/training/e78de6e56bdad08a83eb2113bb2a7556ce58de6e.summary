by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 30 march 2012 updated : 06:44 est , 30 march 2012 a skier buried alive by an avalanche has revealed how he managed to survive - because he remembered to raise his arms a split - second before the snow engulfed him			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , said his quick thinking meant rescuers were able to spot his hand sticking out above the snow			1
they were able to dig an air tunnel to him just moments before his oxygen ran out			1
safety campaign : @entity7 wants skiers to be more aware of safety equipment such as helmets and shovels that can help in avalanches @entity7 's pal @entity24 , 31 , from @entity25 , died in the tragedy in the @entity27 - along with @entity28 , 30 , from @entity29 in the @entity30			1
reliving his nightmare , @entity7 , 30 , said : ' i was trying to hold on to the belief that i was going to get out , but as time went on i slowly started to panic			1
i was thinking : " this is it , this is how i 'm going to die			1
" ' i was trapped under the snow and i could n't breathe at all			1
i was under for a few minutes , but it felt like hours			1
' everything just slowed down			2
thankfully , people above the surface saw my hand and were able to get a tunnel of air down to me			2
when i was dug out it was complete hysteria			2
' it was clear there were three people in much greater need than myself , receiving mouth - to - mouth and heart compression , and helicopters were coming in and out			2
' life cut short : @entity24 , of @entity25 , was killed in tragedy aged only 31 @entity7 had travelled to @entity57 with @entity24 and three other friends to celebrate his 30th birthday			1
he and @entity24 were in a group of four skiers lead by an instructor waiting to be collected by helicopter after completing a run on @entity65 when the avalanche struck			2
@entity7 , a sales manager for @entity67 , said : ' the instructor pointed out an avalanche in the distance so we started moving towards higher ground			0
' seconds later , we realised how quickly it was coming and the instructor was shouting " come on guys , get moving , start moving "			0
' before we knew it we were being catapulted in different directions			0
it was like being hit by a @entity79			1
' i 've been struggling to walk since i got back but it 's absolutely nothing to what @entity24 's family are going through			0
he loved an adventure and lived his life as we all should live it			0
' lucky : @entity7 feared death under snow it is believed @entity7 was trapped for up to 20 minutes			0
the events are being investigated by the @entity91			0
@entity7 is now campaigning for skiers to be given avalanche training			0
he said : ' simple things like checking the weather conditions for the day , following safety instructions and taking transceivers and spades will save lives - but not enough people do this			0
' it can be such a thin line between life and death			0
we received avalanche training beforehand when we were told to put our hands in the air and to keep our helmets on at all times and it saved my life			0

force of impact ' like being hit with a @entity79 transit '
