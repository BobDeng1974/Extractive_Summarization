by @entity0 published : 05:44 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 27 september 2013 a pioneering , minimally - invasive fat reduction procedure promises to leave you sculpted and slim - with no scarring			1
microcannula tumescent liposuction - dubbed @entity5 - is performed under local anaesthetic using tiny steel tubes which can measure less than a millimetre			1
the size of the wound left means any scars will fade until they are almost invisible			1
@entity5 involves a diluted local anaesthesia being injected into areas , and then removing fat with tiny tubes cannula sizes range from 0.9mm to 3mm , much smaller than those used for traditional - and @entity20 - liposuction			1
their small size makes them particularly good for targeting smaller body areas such as bingo wings , chin , inner thighs , flanks , abdomen and chest			1
one of the latest bodyshaping treatments , @entity5 removes unwanted fat and sculpts targeted areas of the body to provide for better definition , and can remove up to 3.5 litres of fat in total			1
traditional liposuction , with larger cannulas , removes fat relatively quickly , which increases the risk of irregularities and depressions in the skin			1
the use of microcannulas , on the other hand , allows smoother and more uniform results			1
@entity5 is the brainchild of @entity50 - based dr. @entity49			1
there is currently just one surgeon qualified to perform the operation in @entity54 , dr @entity52 on @entity55 , @entity56			1
he has performed well over 1,500 @entity5 procedures in his time			1
there 's a problem area on many women 's bodies that nobody talks about			2
it 's not unsightly , not bumpy , not lumpy - and not visible			2
but the painful friction caused by rubbing inner thighs is the bane of many women 's lives - mine included			2
the affliction has burdened me ever since i can remember			2
even as a size eight teenager , my slight knock - knees and upper inner thigh fat meant i suffered painful rubbing and , until now , i chose to accept that as my lifelong fate			1
no matter how much i exercised or dieted , the hot , raw thigh rub would not cease			1
minimally invasive @entity5 changed my thighs : before ( l ) and after ( r ) i spent summers in clear tights and jeans when all i wanted was to go bare - legged or wear shorts			1
i even discovered @entity87 no - toes tights which allowed me to wear sandals			2
i own countless pairs and wore them religiously all summer			2
but last week , for the first time ever , i allowed myself a day in a dress with bare legs			2
and , while my thighs grazed very slightly , there was no friction			2
i was pain and carefree all day			2
i could n't stop smiling - and i still ca n't now			2
' @entity96 as a whole is up 32 per cent year on year in the @entity98			2
this includes laser lipolysis , @entity20 , and non surgical lipo effectively			2
' @entity20 lipo is actually down 5 per cent year on year - there has been quite a marked drop in traffic over the last four months in particular			2
' surgical lipo traffic is up 47 per cent year on year			0
' stats by healthcare search engine @entity110 the idea of being battered and bruised on an operating table terrifies me , so it was the words ' no scars ' and ' minimally invasive ' that sold me on @entity5			1
after my initial consultation with dr @entity52 , he said he could take a litre of fat out of each leg			0
this figure seemed high to me , so i asked him to take less if he could , and to focus on just the chubby bit at the top			0
he stressed that to achieve a finessed and natural look , the whole upper inner thigh would need sculpting - from knee to groin			1
i accepted his expert opinion			0
on the day of the procedure i was given several sedative pills and taken into the operating room where my legs were marked with a blue pen			1
dr @entity52 injected each thigh with a lot of local anaesthetic solution making them swell and firm			1
this helps separate the fat cells from the other surrounding tissue and minimises blood loss			0
fat removal then commenced via about ten entry points on each leg			1
i could feel something in my leg , but no pain			0
it was strange , but not as strange as i thought it would be			0
he removed up to 800ml of fat from each thigh			1
four hours after i entered the building , wrapped in dressings and trussed up in post-operative garments , i was in a cab on my way home			0
the operation took four hours from entering the building to getting a taxi home i had taken the week off and went to my mother 's the next morning			0
i was close to immobile for this time and hobbled for the next couple of weeks after that - so i will say you ca n't go straight back to work			0
also , i was in post-operative garments and dressings meaning i could n't wear normal clothes			0
during the recovery time , my thighs looked irregular			0
they were bruised , hard and lumpy and i worried about the final result			0
dr @entity52 recommended special post-lipo lymphatic massage and two sessions worked wonders in speeding up recovery			0
while downtime was more intense and longer than i imagined , it 's now been six weeks and the swelling is almost completely gone			0
i can hardly see any marks or evidence i ever had anything done and my thighs are almost even and totally soft and smooth			0
the benefits of dr @entity52 's insistence on working from knee to groin are evident to me now			0
my leg shape is a lot straighter and , more importantly , it all looks entirely natural			0
at just 23 , some might say i am too young to make the decision to under the knife			0
but to me , all it means is that i get to live more of my life in comfort			0
' as long as the patient is fit and well then there is no reason why someone who is in their twenties can not recover from the procedure just as quickly as a person in their forties or fifties , ' says dr @entity52			1
explaining my mild discomfort at times , dr @entity52 continues : ' a patient who is slightly older may find the procedure and recovery process slightly easier as their skin is likely to be slightly slacker and looser			1
however this is not always the case ; every patient is different			0
' the price of @entity5 on the inner thigh is n't as terrifying as one might think			1
it all depends on the amount of fat and areas requiring treatment			0
the cost of the procedure i went for is just at the beginning of the threshold - much less than i would have assumed			1
since deciding to go ahead with the operation i have spoken more openly about the affliction i found awkward for so long			0
i am only a size 10 to 12 and painful chafing was , in my mind , reserved for heavier frames			0
but to my surprise - and relief - many shared my concerns			0
i recently went for a massage and told my therapist about my operation			0
she , a size 10 herself , had suffered painful inner thigh chafing her whole life - she calls it ' nappy rash '			1
the big , warm hug she gave me after i wrote down my surgeon 's number for her told me that we need to talk about this more			0
there are things we can do to improve the situation , be it rocking 90s revival flouro cycling shorts under our dresses , no - toes tights - or even a spot of @entity5			1
@entity5 costs from Â£ 2,600			1
