the ancestors of @entity1 may have set up home in a region between @entity4 and @entity5 which contained woody plants that they could use to make fires , according to a new study the people we know as @entity1 actually arrived at the continent in three separate great migrations in the distant past			1
most native americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a ' land bridge ' between @entity18 and @entity19 during the ice ages 15,000 years ago			1
these migrants , known as the ' @entity22 ' , populated most of @entity23			1
but there were two subsequent migrations across the same bridge - and dna from the second and third groups can still be found in @entity29 today			1
the second and third migrations have left an impact only in @entity33 populations that speak @entity35 languages and in the @entity37 who speak a na - dene language			0
eskimos show the most differences , with a mere 50 % of their dna coming from the ' @entity22 '			1
all the groups originally came from @entity4 , @entity43 , a land bridge between @entity18 and @entity23 that existed during the ice ages , more than 15,000 years ago			1
by studying variations in @entity1 dna sequences , the international team found that while most of the @entity1 populations arose from the first migration , two subsequent migrations also made important genetic contributions			0
the paper is published in the journal nature today			0
‘ for years it has been contentious whether the settlement of the @entity23 occurred by means of a single or multiple migrations from @entity4 , ’ said professor @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , who coordinated the study			1
' but our research settles this debate : native americans do not stem from a single migration			0
our study also begins to cast light on patterns of human dispersal within the @entity23			1
’ in the most comprehensive survey of genetic diversity in @entity1 so far , the team took data from 52 @entity1 and 17 @entity4 groups , studying more than 300,000 specific dna sequence variations called @entity75 to examine patterns of genetic similarities and differences between the population groups			1
the second and third migrations have left an impact only in @entity33 populations that speak @entity35 languages and in the @entity37 who speak a @entity86 language however , even these populations have inherited most of their genome from the @entity1 migration			0
@entity35 speakers derive more than 50 % of their dna from @entity22 , and the @entity92 around 90 %			2
this reflects the fact that these two later streams of @entity97 migration mixed with the @entity22 they encountered after they arrived in @entity98			1
a mastodon rib with an embedded spear fragment , proof of some of the earliest inhabitants of @entity23 ‘ there are at least three deep lineages in @entity1 populations , ’ said co-author @entity104 , professor of genetics at @entity106			2
‘ the @entity97 lineage leading to @entity22 is the most anciently diverged , whereas the @entity97 lineages that contributed some of the dna to @entity35 – @entity114 speakers and the @entity86 - speaking @entity92 from @entity115 are more closely related to present - day @entity97 populations			2
’ the team also found that once in the @entity23 , people expanded southward along a route that hugged the coast with populations splitting off along the way			2
after divergence , there was little gene flow among @entity1 groups , especially in @entity23			1
two striking exceptions to this simple dispersal were also discovered			0
first , @entity130 chibchan - speakers have ancestry from both @entity23 , reflecting back - migration from @entity23 and mixture of two widely separated strands of native ancestry			2
second , the @entity136 and coastal @entity137 from north - eastern @entity4 carry ' @entity139 ' dna			0
thus , @entity35 speakers migrated back to @entity18 , bringing @entity1 genes			0
the team 's analysis was complicated by the influx into the hemisphere of @entity146 and @entity147 immigrants since 1492 and the 500 years of genetic mixing that followed			0
to address this , the authors developed methods that allowed them to focus on the sections of peoples ' genomes that were of entirely @entity1 origin			0
‘ the study of @entity1 populations is technically very challenging because of the widespread occurrence of @entity146 and @entity147 mixture in @entity1 groups , ’ said professor @entity54			0
‘ we developed a method to peel back this mixture to learn about the relationships among @entity1 before @entity146 and @entity147 arrived , ’ professor @entity104 said , ‘ allowing us to study the history of many more @entity1 populations than we could have done otherwise			0

@entity138 study proves @entity23 was populated by three groups
' @entity22 ' followed by two other migrations
all arrived via land bridge from @entity4
