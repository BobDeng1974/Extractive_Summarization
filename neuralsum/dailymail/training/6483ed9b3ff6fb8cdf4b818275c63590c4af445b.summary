like a real spider , the unsettling dress responds to external stimuli by coyly dancing around the wearer 's body			1
creepy : the spider dress by @entity22 and @entity23 responds to strangers who stray too close by protectively drawing its legs against the wearer 's body unsettling : the dress has sensors which move its limbs in response to what is happening around it ms @entity8 , whose techno - couture garments have been worn by @entity34 of @entity35 , told fashioningtech.com the dress deals with themes of ' personal space ' and raises questions of control and privacy			1
created in collaboration with with @entity46 software engineer and hacker @entity23 , the garment 's robotic component uses sensors to move its limbs in response to what is happening around it			2
the pair say the dress was created with the aim of giving more power and ' pyschological thrills ' to the ' sugar - sweet character ' of many fashion tech garments			0
it was presented during @entity59 in @entity60 during the @entity61 week last november and prototyped during @entity62 in collaboration with the ' @entity64 ' - @entity62 's famous hackerspace			0
@entity65 : the dress deals with themes of ' personal space ' and raises questions of control and privacy ' playful exploration ' : ms @entity8 's work studies the increasing interaction between humans and machines in an interview with fashiontech.com , she said her work was a ' playful exploration ' of the ever - more intimate relationship between humans and machines which is making electronics an extension of the self			1
' technology combined with fashion creates new ways of communication between people , a new relationship between interface and the body , and a new connection of the body with technology , ' she said			0
' for me it is a playful exploration , where the body is the platform of interaction and expression			0
the position that technology has in our society ( i.e. to ' please ' us ) will get more and more intimate , and as technology crawls closer to the skin we will need to start to rethink and recreate the relation that we have towards technology			0
@entity107 : ms @entity8 's @entity109 dress , which is made from materials which turn from opaque to transparent in response to the wearer 's level of arousal , as measured by her heart rate ' in a way , communication-wise , techno enhanced fashion has the potential to mediate a human in more ways than a human can mediate itself			2
therefore , amongst other reasons , i am interested in how emotional , social and psychological processes can be influenced using electronics as an extension of the self			0
' ms @entity8 's previous works include a dress which emits a ' smoke screen ' of dry ice to camouflage its wearer when someone approaches , and another which turns see through based on its wearer 's ' personal interactions '			1
that latter dress , dubbed @entity109 , is constructed from smart e-foils which change from opaque to transparent in response to the wearer 's level of arousal , as measured by her heart rate .			2
