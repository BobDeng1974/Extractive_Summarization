by @entity0 underground lava flows on @entity2 have carved out channels beneath the surface - and the long - dead volcanoes have left a network of tunnels in which life could thrive			1
distinctive ' pit chains ' on the surface of @entity2 surround the @entity12 volcanoes on the @entity2 - showing that tunnels and cavities have collapsed after the lava flows ceased			1
scientists now believe that remaining tunnels - which may have had running water in their million - year - history - could be tempting targets in the search for microbial life on the @entity22			0
the distinctive markings are thought to have formed when underground lava flows carved out tunnels which then collapsed topographic map showing the elevations of the markings on the surface the markings are found next to huge volcanoes on the @entity2 surface the thin atmosphere of @entity2 means that the planet is blasted with 250 times more radiation than @entity35 - so life on the surface is unlikely			1
subterranean tubes , protected from the deadly rays , could provide a ' haven ' for life - particularly if water was present			2
@entity2 landers have measured surface radiation around 250 times higher than that found on the @entity35 , and more than double that experienced by astronauts on board the @entity48			1
any caves associated with the pit - chains may in future provide a possible refuge for astronauts from the harsh surface radiation			1
the tubes were detected in images released from @entity58 ’s @entity57 , revealing a series of ‘ pit - chains ’ on the flanks of one of the largest volcanoes in the @entity64			2
the images , taken on 22 june 2011 , cover @entity66 in the @entity67 , part of the vast @entity69 on @entity2			1
this region boasts a number of huge volcanoes , including the three collectively known as @entity73			0
to their north sits @entity76 , also known as @entity76 , one of the largest volcanoes in the @entity64 by area and volume			0
pit - chains can have a volcanic origin			0
@entity83 streaming from a volcano solidifies on the surface , leaving a molten tube of lava running below			1
the collapsed tunnels indicate there might be undgerground areas which still exist - and which could offer a haven for microbial life once volcanic activity ceases , the tube empties , leaving behind a subterranean cavity			0
over time , parts of the roof over the cavity may collapse , leaving circular depressions on the surface			0
on @entity35 , recent examples can be seen on the flanks of @entity104 in @entity105 , while on the @entity106 , @entity107 , visited by @entity108 in 1971 , is believed to have formed in the same way billions of years ago			1
another scenario for the creation of the unusual features involves groundwater			0
on @entity35 , there are clear examples of similar structures in ‘ @entity118 ’ regions – after the @entity120 name for a region extending from @entity122 to @entity123 , where this phenomenon was first studied			2
some of @entity35 ’s most famous examples are the network of ‘ cenotes ’ on the @entity129 peninsula of @entity130			2
these deep natural pits form when the surface limestone rocks collapse , exposing the groundwater underneath			0
this origin is the most interesting in the context of the search for microbial life on @entity2			2
if there are any cave - like structures associated with the pits , microorganisms could have survived , protected from the harsh surface environment .			0

collapsed lava tubes indicate there may be caves under @entity2 surface
caves could ' *shield* ' microbes from radiation 250 times higher than @entity35 *'s*
could be refuge for future *missions* to @entity2
