the number of immigrants coming into @entity2 has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade			0
half a million from abroad came to live here in the 12 months to the end of last september , the smallest number since 2001			2
the drop was a result of fewer immigrants coming to study at language or further education schools – although those going to universities went up by 5 per cent – fewer people coming to join their families , and a fall in migrants from new @entity18 countries such as @entity19			0
the @entity24 is pledged to reduce net migration , the number by which the population goes up after immigration and emigration are counted , to below 100,000 a year			1
drop : net migration is now at its lowest level for a decade , figures from the @entity28 showed yesterday ’s figures from the @entity28 put net migration at 153,000 over the 12 months , compared to 242,000 in the previous 12 months			1
it is the lowest net migration figure since 2003			1
the 500,000 immigrants in the 12 months to september 2012 compares to 581,000 in the previous period			2
immigration minister @entity34 said : ‘ net migration is now at its lowest level for a decade showing we are continuing to bring immigration back under control			1
‘ today 's statistics show another significant fall in net migration - down by more than a third since june 2010			1
this has been driven in the most recent period by a decline in the number of people coming to the @entity2			0
’ more up to date figures showed that applications for further education colleges and @entity50 language schools were down by almost half in the year to march 2013			2
applications to universities were up five per cent			0
immigration minister @entity34 said tougher action on bogus colleges had seen the number of students coming to @entity2 fall dramatically mr @entity34 added : ‘ the figures show we have cut out abuse while encouraging the brightest and best migrants who contribute to economic growth , with a fiver per cent increase in the number of sponsored student visa applications for our world - class universities , and a fiver per cent increase in the number of visas issued to skilled workers			1
‘ we have made substantial inroads in cutting immigration and now have a more selective system that works in our national interest			2
’ mr @entity34 is leading a ministerial taskforce looking to curb benefits , housing and healthcare access for immigrants to deter thousands of people moving to @entity2			2
the government also wants to make it easier to identify and deport people who are in @entity2 illegally			0
prime minister @entity87 and home secretary @entity88 may want to reduce net migration from @entity91 countries to less than 100,000 before the next election in 2015			1
however , the left - leaning @entity93 warned attempts to cut immigration ; levels could harm the economy			1
@entity98 , associate director at @entity93 , said : ‘ today 's statistics show a continued decline in net migration to the @entity2			1
but the government 's progress towards its target of reducing net migration to less than 100,000 by 2015 is still in large part being driven by falling numbers of international students			1
‘ this decline in international student numbers comes at considerable economic cost to the @entity2 at a time when we can ill afford it			0
‘ in any case , falling student numbers will not help the government meet its target in the medium term			0
‘ because most students stay in the @entity2 only for a short time , reduced immigration now will mean reduced emigration in the future , which by 2015 could partially reverse the falls in net migration we are seeing now			1
’ the most common reason given for migrating to @entity2 remains study , the @entity28 said , with 190,000 foreign students arriving in the period , although this was down 22 per cent or 56,000 from 246,000 in the previous year			0
the number of visas issued fell 6 per cent to 499,780 in the year ending march 2013 - the lowest 12 - monthly total since comparable data was first published in 2005			0
there was a ‘ significant ’ decrease in the number of immigrants arriving from new @entity18 countries , which includes @entity143 countries such as @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 and @entity148 subcontinent countries such as @entity149 , @entity148 and @entity19			0
some 105,000 immigrants from new @entity18 countries arrived in the @entity2 in the year to september , down 36 per cent or 61,000 from 166,000 in the previous year			0
a total of 58,000 immigrants arrived from countries which joined the @entity154 in 2004 , including @entity155 , the @entity156 and @entity157 , down 22 per cent or 17,000 from the previous year .			0
