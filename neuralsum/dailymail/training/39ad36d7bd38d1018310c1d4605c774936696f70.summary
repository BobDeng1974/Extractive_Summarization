killer heels , soft music , expensive hair , lots of champagne			0
at first glance , this crowd of good - looking women seem to be on a rather glamorous girls ' night out , swapping stories about work , kids and husbands			1
but around 10pm the first party game gets underway and it becomes apparent that this is n't your standard ladies ' night			2
a line of salt is poured up each of her thighs , a shot glass of tequila placed on her belly and a wedge of lemon in her mouth			0
volunteers are requested to slam the spirit , and soon a line of tipsy , frisky women has formed - wedding rings flashing - and @entity39 is underway			1
some neck the tequila , most spend a lot longer working their way up the stranger 's body , inviting their new friends to join them before disappearing off to bedrooms to carry on the party			1
welcome to @entity16 , the @entity18 's first women - only sex club for straight girls			1
it is cool to be a ' lipstick lesbian ' right now , with model - of - the - moment @entity55 , 22 , becoming the poster girl for bi-curious women after her relationship with 36 - year - old actress @entity60 earlier this year			1
glamorous stars @entity62 , 39 , @entity63 , 28 , @entity64 , 28 , and @entity65 , 23 , have all admitted to relationships with women in the past and research shows that more and more straight women are keen to experiment sexually with girls			1
all @entity16 members ( some pictured here ) have to be vetted by founder @entity74 @entity16 is the brainchild of @entity74 * , a marketing executive and sexually adventurous thirty - something who found @entity81 's existing swinging parties a big turn off when her and a long - term boyfriend decided to give them a whirl			1
@entity74 , 34 , says : ' i tried the current elite sex parties but my partner and i both found they were easily dominated by men , often drunk and lecherous			1
it appeared women were there primarily to please their partners			2
something more glamorous , and where women really were calling all the shots so i decided to try it with a small group of interested friends , and remove men from the equation entirely			1
' i have learned that most women are attracted to women , it does n't mean that they are gay			2
it ’s the fluid nature of today ’s sexuality			0
most of our members are married or have long - term partners , and @entity16 is a place for them to have a wild night playing with other like - minded girls before going back to their grown - up lives			1
' most members are high - flying career women ( this picture posed by models ) and @entity74 claims that the club is for sexual deviants who like to play above board the club celebrated its first birthday last month and from a small group of frisky friends the membership has grown to a community of several hundred well - heeled women who attend parties and events as well as chat through the club 's website			1
@entity74 claims that the club 's success is down to its commitment to exclusivity			1
the monthly sex soirees are held in high - end penthouse apartments in @entity81 's trendy @entity141 neighbourhood , and , like all the best clubs , @entity16 has strict membership criteria			1
' it 's free to join , but all applicants have to be personally recommended by an existing member , and - probably more importantly - they have to be hot , very hot			1
she says : ' our members are generally very glamorous , professional city women			1
they expect a certain level of prestige at events - drinks , design , entertainment all has to be the very best - and they also expect a certain level of women to play with			2
they want to party with people like themselves so being attractive is crucial			2
' is n't that terribly shallow ? ' possibly , ' she says			0
' but it 's no different than checking someone out in a bar or choosing a @entity166 date based on a picture			2
plus there 's actually more to the application process , including a questionnaire and personal meeting			2
we are after women with brains as well as brilliant bodies			2
' most members are straight women keen to experiment with other women but remain anonymous ( left )			1
model @entity55 ( right ) is one high profile woman who has had relationships with both sexes as head of the membership committee @entity74 will quiz potential members on their lifestyle , education and sexual leanings			1
she is keen to point out that a @entity16 party is not a place to find your soul mate : ' for many people it 's a once - in - a - lifetime " let ’s check this one off the bucket list " experience before going back to their husbands			1
gay women are welcome to apply , but they probably wo n't meet the love of their life			0
' at the monthly events a strict dress code is enforced and sexy lingerie is a must for any party - goers			1
' once we had a student member arrive in ugly @entity207 pants , ' says @entity74 , ' i told her " they go or you do , " the knickers came off and she stayed and had a lot of fun , ' aside from the posh pants and no camera policy , guests claim that anything else goes as the lights dim			2
body @entity219 tends to break the ice and the women are quick to start making use of the venue as clothes start disappearing and the bedrooms and bubble bath gets busy			0
events take place at luxury penthouses in @entity81 's trendy @entity141 area ' guests can get as involved - or not - as they want , ' says @entity74 , who as hostess claims not to get too involved herself			1
' some choose to watch , some end up snogging all night in the corner , and lots end up trying all kinds of things they have never done before			0
the parties are supposed to finish at 2am but we 're often still going as the sun comes up			0
' the success of @entity16 in @entity81 has led to interest from women ( and investors ) around the world , especially @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 , where @entity74 has plans to launch new clubs in 2015			1
she says : ' we 're already having to think about bigger venues to cope with demand here in @entity81 , and i would love to see @entity16 evolve into a global community			1
' women are getting more adventurous , and more confident about asking for what they want			0
we love men but sometimes they just are n't enough , and @entity16 is here to fix that			2
' @entity264 * , 38 , is an executive pa in @entity81			2
she is a married mother - of - one and has been to three @entity16 parties			1
she says : ' when i arrived at my first party i was greeted at the door by @entity74 and ushered into the lounge area where there were lots of beautiful women having cocktails and talking , it was all very civilised			1
everyone was really friendly and there was an excitement in the air , a kind of nervous tension			0
people knew they were there for a good time and that it could get cheeky			0
' i did n't expect people to be so approachable and interested in what i did , but i guess that 's women for you			2
we like to talk and we like to flirt			0
' you need an icebreaker at any event and after a wonderful burlesque performance there was a guest speaker talking about the difference between orgasming and climaxing ( i did n't even know there was one ) and this cheeky entertainment escalated the sexual tension			0
' the evening had a very natural progression though			0
things do n't really kick off until after midnight			0
women need foreplay do n't we ? we need to be warmed up			0
' after the speaker some ladies continued with conversations , some went off to the bedrooms and some stayed in the lounge where we some fun tequila body shots			0
if you wanted to watch then that was fine , or if you wanted to do more then that was fine as well			0
@entity16 allows women to explore their sexuality without performing for a man , claims one member ' at one point i went to the bathroom in the bedroom and as i walked by there were two girls on the bed having a grand old time			1
i thought : " i could join in , or i could watch , or i could just leave them to it , " i decided to stay and watch and it was very hot			0
later i did get involved in some heavy petting with one girl , then left the party by myself around 2am			0
' i would say most women there were straight			2
some had partners who were supportive of them going , some ladies were there without their partners knowing			0
they wanted a safe environment that they could experiment in and know that they were not being looked upon or judged			0
' i came away and told my husband all about my adventures and he reacted very well but we have a very strong relationship and are very happy with each other			0
' we have been to @entity351 and another sex club together but @entity16 is different			1
when you take the male element out it seems a lot more about you and what you want			0
you 're getting to explore your female sexuality 100 per cent without having to perform for a male watching			0
' there 's no photography so everyone 's identity is kept anonymous and i think that 's very important			0
it means we are more likely to take risks and explore			0
what happens in skirt club stays in @entity16 and that 's what keeps us coming back for more			1
' * names have been changed			0
