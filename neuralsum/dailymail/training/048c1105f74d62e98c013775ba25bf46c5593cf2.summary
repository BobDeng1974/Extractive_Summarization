by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 @entity1 have been impressive going forward , but it â€™s their strength in midfield that gives them a solid platform from which to attack			1
@entity7 pulls the strings in the middle with @entity10 and @entity11 providing energy either side of him			0
@entity14 gives them balance alongside @entity16 up front , but if the @entity1 win the midfield battle , they have a huge chance to win against @entity21 in friday 's @entity23 quarter - final			1
midfield maestros : @entity7 and @entity10 give @entity1 a platform from which to attack talking tactics : @entity14 gives the @entity1 balance alongside frontman @entity16 @entity28 : @entity1 highlights @entity29 has an incredible @entity23 scoring record , but sometimes he needs to stay closer to goal			2
he moves from the centre to create space , which can lead to goals , but he is better off in the middle			0
there 's something not quite right with @entity21			2
they need to stop indulging @entity39 in the middle and use him in his best position as a full back			1
let @entity43 boss the midfield because nobody is dominating the middle			0
@entity47 also needs to be far more ruthless in his game			0
out of place : @entity21 need to start using @entity39 in his best position as a full back @entity51 : @entity39 highlights			1

@entity1 's strength in midfield gives @entity55 a solid platform to attack
@entity58 have huge chance of *beating* @entity21 should they win the battle in the middle of the park
@entity21 need to stop playing @entity39 in midfield and play him in his natural position at full back
