by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 duo @entity2 and @entity4 decided to have some fun during their time at @entity8 by taking penalties with a large exercise ball			1
both players had a lot of success with the ball when it came to taking penalties - despite the size of the piece of gym equipment			2
the worst effort came from @entity20 who managed to balloon the ball over the bar from 12 yards			0
the two full - back 's goalkeeping skills left a lot to be desired as they failed to stop the tame shots			0
@entity3 boss @entity45 will definitely not be calling on the duo to have a stint in goal if @entity49 or @entity50 were to get injured during the course of the season .			1

the @entity55 side are *gearing* up for the new season at @entity8
@entity3 will play @entity58 in a *pre-season* *friendly* on *saturday*
@entity61 is not allowed to train with his new @entity3 team - mates
