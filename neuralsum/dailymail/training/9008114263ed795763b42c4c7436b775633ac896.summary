by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam it 's not quite time to say goodnight to mr @entity5			2
the oldest swinger in town proved this week that he can still find his way around a golf course , embarrassing along the way a few of the younger generation who might want a place in his @entity17 @entity16 team			1
the seven shots that separated @entity21 ’s fourth - round score from that of @entity23 will , in likelihood , be used as a stick to beat 14 - time major winner			1
but that would be unfair , albeit only to the 64 - year - old			1
his brilliant , crafty round of 68 deserves recognition in its own right , proving as it did that the five - time winner of golf ’s oldest major can still do damage from way back in the fairway			1
there wo n’t be another extension for a man who , having passed the entry cut - off of 60 years old , has received two rules exemptions to get him this far			2
those were sentimental decisions and a fair recognition of his extraordinary second - place finish in 2009 , but a greater truth is that this golfer is still too good – and popular - to be pensioned off			1
when the end appeared nigh , in the gloom of @entity49 in 2010 as he missed the cut in front of a small crowd , he fought back by making the cut in three of the next four years , including this one			2
in 2011 , he was 22nd			2
‘ that was just a really good day , ’ he said yesterday , after his four - under - par round left him on one over for the tournament			1
‘ @entity72 , i enjoyed that			0
’ cohorts : @entity21 discusses his options on the eighth with caddie @entity77 sinker : @entity21 lining one up on the 18th green video the open championship : final round masters won : 1977 , 1981 @entity17 @entity83 : 1982 the @entity83 : 1975 , 1977 , 1980 , 1982 , 1983 @entity84 2nd : 1978 his gallery was one of the biggest of the day , as usual			1
‘ terrible shot , @entity5 , ’ laughed one old stager in the crowd after @entity21 found the green with a brilliant fairway wood at the 17th			1
moments earlier , when he balanced on the edge of a bunker at the 16th and chipped sublimely along the contours to three feet , there was one of the biggest roars of the day			0
he claimed his fourth birdie of the round , tipped his hat and moved on			2
‘ great play , @entity5 , ’ said a young boy in full golf gear			0
‘ that ’s very kind , thank you , ’ came the reply			0
he remains a gentleman of the game , impeccable in his behaviour			0
when a group of teenagers oddly took to mocking his hair at the 18th , he smiled and walked on			0
gentleman : the legend has won @entity43 on five previous occasions embrace : @entity21 has a chat with @entity120 of @entity121 his drive had split the fairway			1
‘ i think , if i ’m not mistaken , that i did not miss a fairway today , ’ he said afterwards , before correcting himself			0
‘ sorry , i missed it on 11			0
@entity21 took five birdies in all , finishing his 37th @entity43 with a four at the last after walking the 18th fairway cap in hand			1
he was given a standing ovation			0
it ’s unique to this sport to see a man well into his seventh decade playing with the best			0
it ’s rarer still to see one outplay them , laughing as he goes .			0

@entity21 has shown he can still swing with the best at @entity43
shot a final round 68 to finish on one over for the week
set to be the @entity17 captain for the @entity16 later this year
