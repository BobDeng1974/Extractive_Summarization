more than a dozen areas in the @entity1 have been shaken by small earthquakes triggered by oil and gas drilling , according to a government report released today			1
the man - made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states , including parts of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
earthquakes , they said , were sometimes caused by fracking , in which large volumes of water , sand and chemicals are pumped into rock formations to free oil or gas			2
since 2000 , several of these areas have experienced high levels of seismicity			0
researchers say there have been ' substantial increases since 2009 that continue today ' they said the spike in seismic activity was largely down to the oil and gas industry injecting wastewater deep underground , which can activate dormant faults			1
many studies have linked the rise in small quakes to the injection of wastewater into disposal wells , but the @entity52 's report takes the first comprehensive look at where the man - made quakes are occurring			1
' the hazard is high in these areas , ' said @entity58 , who leads the agency 's national mapping project			0
@entity16 lately has been rocked by more magnitude - 3 quakes than @entity62 , the most seismically active of the lower 48 states , @entity58 said			1
@entity16 was not on scientists ' radar until recently when the state experienced a spate of quakes , the largest registering a magnitude - 5.6 in 2011			1
a 2014 @entity69 with the areas most at risk shown in warmer colours			0
recently , man - made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states , including parts of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 the cumulative number of earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.0 or larger in the central and eastern @entity1 , 1973 - 2014			1
the rate of earthquakes began to increase starting around 2009 and accelerated in 2013 - 2014 earlier this week , the @entity83 acknowledged that it is very likely most of the recent shaking is from wastewater disposal			2
many faults awakened by drilling have not moved in millions of years , @entity52 geophysicist @entity87 said			1
' they 're ancient faults , ' @entity87 said			2
' we do n't always know where they are			0
' a message to the @entity95 was not immediately returned			0
the industry group has said efforts are made to map fault lines where drilling occurs			2
the fluid pressure in the pores and fractures of the rocks is called the ' pore pressure			0
' the pore pressure acts against the weight of the rock and the forces holding the rock together			0
if the pore pressures are low - especially compared to the forces holding the rock together - then only the imbalance of natural in situ earth stresses will cause an occasional earthquake			2
if , however , pore pressures increase , then it would take less of an imbalance of in situ stresses to cause an earthquake			0
this type of failure is called shear failure			0
injecting fluids into the subsurface is one way of increasing the pore pressure and causing faults and fractures to ' fail ' more easily			0
earthquakes can be caused by injecting fluid into the subsurface or by extracting fluids at a rate that causes subsidence and slippage along planes of weakness in the @entity140			0

scientists said it 's difficult to know what jobs will trigger shaking a group of experts met last year in @entity16 to pinpoint seismic hotspots around the country caused by induced quakes			1
scientists initially identified 14 regions affected by quakes linked to drilling			1
they later added three other high - risk areas - northern @entity16 - southern @entity13 ; @entity161 , @entity12 ; and @entity162 , @entity17			1
the findings were released at a @entity165 meeting in @entity166 , @entity62			0
seismic hazard maps produced by the @entity52 and used for building codes and insurance purposes do n't include quakes caused by the oil and gas industry			2
scientists said it 's difficult to know what jobs will trigger shaking			0
researchers study man - made quakes in the affected areas to determine how often they are expected to occur in the next year and how much shaking they would produce			1
a series of earthquakes that rattled a small @entity17 community have been linked to nearby oil and gas operations			2

man - made quakes have hit once stable regions in central and eastern @entity1
these include @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17
some were caused by injection of wastewater which can activate faults
many of faults awakened by drilling have not moved in millions of years
