he said : ' we started taking her out when she was five but she was too young to get into the water then it was all a bit overwhelming for her , the ocean can seem a scary place to a child			2
' but when we went again the following year she did get in the water for a few minutes			0
and then this year , she loved it so much we could n't get her out of the water			0
' i was glowing just watching her , there is no better feeling to watch her in the water knowing she was comfortable and was enjoying it so much			0
