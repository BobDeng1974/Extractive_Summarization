as thousands of fans and the world ’s paparazzi lined the canals in @entity5 last weekend , there was clearly one star draw : @entity8 ’s most famously fanciable film star , @entity7 , was marrying at long , long last			0
but as the pictures of the state - like , four - day ceremony flooded in , it became clear that all eyes were not , in fact , on the @entity16 - winning silver fox			0
instead , they were on his new wife , @entity20 , and her string of incredible outfits			2
in the space of one weekend , not only did @entity24 become mrs @entity25 , she also became an international fashion icon			2
meanwhile @entity24 , in her first post-wedding appearance on sunday , updates the style with a leg - flashing , long - sleeved , racy and lacy white @entity40 haute couture dress , teamed with his golden @entity43 slingbacks @entity45 is shipshape at the @entity46 in a navy and white dress by @entity50 stalwart @entity49			2
but in the same colours , @entity24 is simply stunning in a @entity53 trouser suit @entity28 is sugar - almond sweet in a pink dress by @entity56 at a palace garden party			1
@entity24 in the same colour looks to have stepped straight out of a fashion shoot in her sassy @entity61 - style frock and , as one winning outfit after another appeared — from a fiery scarlet floor - length gown to a wonderful white lace creation — fashionistas were quick to compare her with the style queen whose crown she appears to have stolen : the @entity69			1
for while the two women are equally adept at smart , chic fashion , @entity24 , it seems , is outdoing @entity28 in every way			1
when @entity28 , 32 , chooses a pretty , long - sleeved , white lace frock , @entity24 , 36 , takes the same shape but adds bold boning and bright pink flowers			1
while @entity28 loves vibrant shades of pink and red , @entity24 takes exactly the same hues but swaps @entity28 ’s straight , pencil - skirt fit for a flared shape or updates it with a more modern cut			1
while the fiery red of @entity28 ’s @entity92 gown is striking , the billowing sleeves make it old fashioned — especially compared with @entity24 ’s firecracker version at her wedding rehearsal dinner in @entity5 @entity28 is the innocent country lass in her floral dress and pink cardigan			1
yet @entity24 manages to look powerful and flowerful in a colourful @entity100 dress and brave yellow pumps in @entity102 where @entity28 does safe , smart and sometimes staid , @entity24 lifts the look and applies a whirl of modern - meets - timeless			1
perhaps @entity24 ’s serious job , as a human rights lawyer at @entity109 ’s distinguished @entity108 , encourages her to be fun and frivolous when it comes to off - duty fashion			2
in court , she must wear the dowdy barrister ’s uniform of black and white under heavy robes and itchy horsehair wig — meaning she can only show off her style credentials away from the workplace			0
@entity28 is ladylike in a scarlet @entity121 coat and dress worn with her trusty nude platforms			0
@entity24 is smart but modern , too , in a @entity125 suit , while striking floral slingbacks give a dash of surprise no such escape awaits @entity28 , of course , as she is constrained by royal protocol at all times			1
she is also naturally conservative , as befits the future @entity134 , and always chooses safe , appropriate attire			0
so where @entity24 likes short skirts , @entity28 sticks to knee - length , and while @entity24 experiments with flares and jeans , @entity28 rarely wears trousers in her public life			1
@entity28 can sometimes look a little frumpy			0
at least , that is the effect when seen against @entity24 , with her impeccable knack of giving her wardrobe a clever twist			0
@entity28 is safe and suitable in a sparkly , tweed suit by @entity150 designer @entity149 at an official reception			0
@entity24 wears a similar @entity125 suit for work , but with a hipper , trendier cut , giving a flash of cleavage in black velvet by @entity158 , @entity28 is reminiscent of a pre-marriage princess @entity159			1
her dress is eye - catching , until you see @entity24 ’s similar , but racier , @entity164 satin gown , with fabulous earrings @entity24 has a youthful , devil - may - care approach : she is unafraid of ripped jeans , camouflage , jumpsuits , eccentric jewellery , floppy hats , short shorts and things that drape rather than cling			0
she also does n’t mind exposing a bit of flesh			0
so @entity24 ’s skirts are that bit shorter than @entity28 ’s , and her shoes are that bit higher and glitzier than the @entity69 ’s sensible footwear choices			1
if anyone marvelled at one of our biggest and best - known movie stars marrying a ‘ normal ’ woman in @entity24 , her fashion parade has shown she has oodles of movie - star glamour herself and can more than handle herself on the world stage			0
the duchess is neat , chic and safe in a feminine @entity192 peplum dress and black @entity194 shoes			0
@entity24 wears white , too — but is more edgy in her less - fitted dress worn with statement necklace and platform sandals she combines the clean , sharp lines ( and big shades ) of @entity200 , the beauty of @entity202 , and the boldness of @entity204 with an unrestrained taste for designer fashion			2
and if more proof were needed , there ’s already an ‘ @entity214 ’ : the @entity164 monochrome dress she wore for her arrival in @entity5 sold out immediately , and blogs have sprung up across the internet dedicated to her wardrobe			2
so while it was once impossible to conceive that anyone could out - chic @entity69 — just as it was unimaginable @entity25 would ever remarry — @entity24 has achieved both in one amazing weekend			1
picture research : @entity220 .			0

fashionistas have compared @entity20 *'s* style to @entity69
while they are equally adept , @entity24 , it seems , is outdoing @entity28 in every way
already an ' @entity214 ' with dresses she wears selling out immediately
