in the theatre of sporting combat , many teams are seen in triumph while wearing the colour red			2
now a study has found that sportsmen with higher testosterone levels are more likely to choose that colour than any other			1
@entity9 , who led the study at the @entity10 , said choosing red ‘ may unconsciously signal something about their competitive nature and it may well be something that affects how their opponents respond ’			2
men who choose to wear red when competing in sports have higher levels of testosterone than those who choose to wear blue - the @entity21 team was wearing red when it won the @entity23 in 2013 the study shows , he added , ‘ that there is something special about the colour red in competition , and that it is associated with our underlying biological systems ’			1
some might add that the success of teams in red – such as @entity33 in football , @entity35 and the @entity36 in rugby union , and @entity38 in @entity39 – backs up the theory			1
they might also point to @entity42 being promoted to the @entity43 this year after changing their strip from blue to red			0
and @entity48 , for example , famously chooses to wear a red shirt on the last day of major competitions			0
men who choose to wear red have higher levels of testosterone			1
this makes them more dominant and aggressive meaning they are more likely to win when playing competitive sport			0
sportsmen also view opponents who are wearing red as tougher competition			1
but despite the link with testosterone , those who chose red did not actually perform better in the study in which 73 men were told they would be performing a competitive task and their performances would be placed on a leaderboard			2
they then chose either a red or blue symbol to represent them in the table and completed the tasks , as well as answering questions aimed at gauging whether various personal reasons may have affected their colour choice			0
their testosterone levels were measured from saliva samples at the start of the study and again at the end			2
the data revealed that men who chose red had higher baseline testosterone levels – and they rated the colour as having higher levels of characteristics such as dominance and aggression , than men who chose blue			1
but colour choice did not seem to be related to performance in the competitive task			0
the researchers believe that direct competition , in which one of several teams is wearing red , may be necessary for the red advantage to occur			1
higher testosterone levels make men more likely to win because it causes them to be more dominant and aggressive			1
@entity48 famously wears red on the last day of all major competitions dr @entity9 added : ‘ in some species of monkeys the redness of skin relates to both the individual 's testosterone levels and also their dominance			2
‘ it is possible that a similar innate effect may occur in humans			0
’ however , cultural associations made with the colour red , as in warning signs and traffic lights , may also have an impact			0
dr @entity9 said : ‘ this is the first study to look at whether biological factors , specifically testosterone which has been linked to characteristics such as dominance , aggression and competitiveness , may affect the choices we make in competitive scenarios			0
‘ also by allowing participants in a test to choose their colour , this study reveals that there may be something intrinsically different about “ red ” competitors , that can give them an advantage			0

men who wear red when competing have higher testosterone levels
higher testosterone levels make them more dominant and aggressive
could *explain* why @entity33 and @entity36 are so successful
sportsmen see opponents who are wearing red as strong competition
