habitable super-earths - that have up to five times the mass of our own planet - could possess vast , long - lasting oceans			2
oceans cover more than two thirds of the @entity8 's surface and are continually replenished by volcanic activity dragging up water buried deep underground			1
and now a new study indicates that habitable zone planets may be even better at establishing and maintaining these large bodies of water			0
researchers from the @entity17 believe that habitable super-earths with up to five times the mass of our own planet , could hold vast oceans			2
this image shows an artist 's impression of a gas giant planet rising over the horizon of an alien waterworld a planet occupying a star 's habitable zone is in an orbit where temperatures are mild enough to allow the existence of liquid surface water , making lakes , rivers and oceans possible			2
most scientists agree that liquid water is needed for the development of life as we know it			1
dr @entity42 , from the @entity17 , who led the study said : ' when people consider whether a planet is in the habitable zone , they think about its distance from the star and its temperature			0
computer simulations recently revealed the vital role oceans play in moderating climate			0
without large expanses of water on a planet ’s surface , seasonal temperature rises would be too rapid and weather too extreme to provide a comfortable home for life			0
even a planet in the habitable zone of its star - the orbital region where temperatures are mild enough to permit liquid surface water - is likely to be sterile and lifeless without oceans			2
in our own solar system , barren @entity68 has no oceans despite being in the sun ’s habitable zone , the researchers point out			0
as a result , its air temperature swings over a range of 100 ° @entity78 factoring oceans into climate models was vital to knowing whether a planet could develop and sustain life , said the researchers from the @entity85 ’s @entity84			0
' however , they should also think about oceans , and look at super-earths to find a good sailing or surfing destination			0
' studies have shown that the @entity8 's mantle holds several oceans ' worth of water that has been pulled underground by the movements of tectonic plates and sinking ocean floors			1
without water being brought back to the surface by volcanism , the oceans would soon disappear			1
dr @entity42 's team used computer simulations to verify that the same recycling process that keeps the @entity8 's ocean basins filled with water also takes place on super-earths			1
in fact , oceans were even more likely to be found on planets having two to four times the mass of the @entity8			1
super-earth oceans also persisted for a very long time - at least 10 billion years , assuming they were not boiled away by a swelling ' red giant ' star near the end of its life			0
the largest planet studied , with five times the @entity8 's mass , did not develop oceans for around a billion years due to its thicker crust			1
' this suggests that if you want to look for life , you should look at older super-earths , ' said dr @entity42			0

they found oceans were more likely to be found on planets having two to four times the mass of the @entity8 ( artist 's impression pictured )			1
most scientists agree liquid water is needed for the development of life complex life was most likely to be found on @entity155 planets about 5.5 billion years old , around a billion years older than the @entity8 , said the scientists			1
scientists have so far confirmed the existence of more than 1,739 planets outside our solar system , according to information from the @entity162			0
there are thousands more unconfirmed ' candidates ' , and a total of 452 multiple planet systems have also been logged			0
the findings were presented at the @entity169 annual meeting in @entity170			0
