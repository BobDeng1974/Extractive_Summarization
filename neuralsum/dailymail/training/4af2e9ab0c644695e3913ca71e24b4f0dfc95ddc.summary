by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 _ @entity3 has jumped to the defence of @entity5 and rubbished suggestions that his former club are in terminal decline			1
@entity5 have made a calamitous start to life under new manager @entity11 , failing to win two @entity13 games against @entity14 and @entity15 before crashing to a 4 - 0 at @entity16 in the @entity17			1
@entity18 has admitted he is ‘ scared ’ for the club he served so well			2
@entity3 , however , is a little more optimistic and does not believe that @entity5 will stagnate in the same as @entity21 did following the @entity24 club ’s sustained dominance in @entity26 football in the 1980 's			1
poor start : @entity11 is under pressure after failing to win in his opening three @entity5 games red alert : @entity5 were thrashed 4 - 0 by @entity16 in the second round of the @entity17 on tuesday night @entity33 blames injuries , errors and luck ‘ i understand where @entity18 is coming from with his comments but i do n’t think we will do a @entity21 ’ @entity3 said , ’ we wo n’t be like that			1
‘ you do n’t want barren spells because the @entity13 gets stronger			0
@entity44 football moves on again if you are not in it for a year			0
that is the way football is it does n’t stand still for anybody			0
so problems have to be addressed quickly			0
’ @entity3 does , however , accept that urgent improvement is required : ‘ if you do n’t win something at a club of this magnitude then people start questioning the players the manager and everybody			1
that is to be expected			0
the history of this club is about winning			2
recovery : @entity3 , part of the famous treble - winning side , is hopeful @entity5 will make a recovery ‘ we have been so dominant so when you do n’t win something then people say you are not the team you used to be			1
‘ i have seen comments recently , and it is heart wrenching , saying this is the worst @entity5 team in 20 years or whatever			1
hello ! get a grip and stop talking about @entity5 in this way because @entity5 will be there or thereabouts			2
’ ‘ when you lose a successful manager after 25 years that is a big big thing			0
you bring a new manager in and it does n’t work out so you change again			0
it is going to take time			0
@entity11 has done it in @entity44 and has a great record we are hoping he can bring that to this club now			2
’ @entity3 was speaking at the launch of @entity5 and @entity86 ’s ‘ @entity89 ’ pitch at @entity88 .			1

@entity3 has defended his former team following their defeat at @entity16
he *insists* the club are not in terminal decline and will make a recovery
@entity33 is under fire following @entity5 's *humiliating* loss in @entity17
