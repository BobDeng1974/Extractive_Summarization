it takes a lot to steal the show from the notoriously flamboyant @entity4 entries , but this @entity7 sign language interpreter 's energetic moves and expressive gestures have managed to do just that			1
@entity10 has become an overnight sensation in @entity7 after putting on the performance of his life , interpreting pop singer @entity15 's attempt to enter @entity4			1
but while @entity15 's upbeat tune may have failed to impress audiences in the @entity20 country , being voted ninth out of 12 entries vying to represent at the annual competition , many are now calling for 48 - year - old @entity10 to take the stage for @entity7 in @entity25 this may			1
star : @entity10 has become an overnight sensation in @entity7 after he appeared on national television hit : @entity10 interpreted pop singer @entity15 's bid for @entity4 glory clicks : but while @entity15 's song only came ninth out of 12 entries , it has been shared thousands of times shared : and it is all down to @entity10 's exuberant interpretation - complete with hip wiggles the video of @entity42 's exuberant interpretation has been shared thousands of times in @entity7 , and across the world			1
the delighted interpreter has told @entity7 newspapers he was ' thrilled ' with the reaction - and has been ' love - bombed ' on @entity48 by people who enjoyed his energetic performance , even getting the odd marriage proposal			1

people are even proposing to marry me			0
this is something i could never imagine			0
' it 's a once in lifetime experience after being a signer for so many years			2
i love that sign language gets so much attention at the moment			1
' hilarious : @entity10 says he has been ' love - bombed ' on social media since the show went out interpretation : he hopes his translation enables deaf people to get the ' feel ' of the song water cooler : he wants deaf people to be able to discuss the song at work just like their hearing colleages @entity10 told @entity7 newspaper @entity74 he ' just get funky and let go ' when he got up on stage			1
speaking to @entity55 , he added : ' the music is a part of your entire body			0
' that is the charming thing with sign language it is so expressive and when you hear the music you basically freak out and loose yourself			2
' meanwhile , he revealed that his aim is to ensure deaf people could grasp the message the singer was trying to convey			0
' we get the songs a few weeks before the contest and then its up to you to analyze the song , ' he explained			0

how do you get into the rhythm and so forth			0
' the important thing is that people who can ´ t hear is suppose to get the same experience as people who can			0

' future : it is not clear whether @entity10 is going to be the interpreter for this year 's @entity7 entry yet entry : @entity7 is going to be represented by @entity113 , who won the public vote @entity115 marks : however , it seems the @entity7 public would give ' dix points ' if @entity10 is the interpreter it is not yet clear whether @entity10 will be heading to @entity25 as the official sign language interpreter			1
@entity7 is going to be represented by @entity113 this year , and he will no doubt be hoping to take home the trophy			2
but it seems the @entity7 might be a little sad if @entity10 does n't make an appearance			2
' i know that @entity125 will make us proud in @entity25 , but i would not say no if i was asked , ' he told @entity55			0
' perhaps we could both be on stage , ' added @entity10 , who also revealed his ' dream artist ' to work with would be @entity129			0
