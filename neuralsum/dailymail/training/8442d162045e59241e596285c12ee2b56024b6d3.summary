by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 19:15 est , 16 january 2014 more americans than ever before believe global warming is n't happening , a new study has found			2
the @entity6 study found the number has risen to 23 percent , up 7 percentage points since april 2013			1
the latest survey , taken in november 2013 , finds that the majority of @entity3 — 63 percent — do believe in climate change , and 53 percent are ' somewhat ' or ' very ' worried about the consequences			1
climate change protesters on @entity14 : despite protests , more the number of @entity3 who do not believe in global warming is rising			1
' the great majority of climate scientists have concluded that global warming is happening , mostly human caused and , if left unchecked , will have serious consequences for human societies and the natural world , ' the report 's authors said			1
' yet , over the years , there has been considerable confusion within the @entity3 public about the level of scientific agreement on the subject			0
' the study , conducted in november , found about two in three @entity3 ( 63 % ) believe global warming is happening			1
' relatively few – only 23 percent – believe it is not , ' they said			2
' the proportion who believe global warming is real has remained steady since @entity38			0
' however , the proportion who do not believe global warming is happening has increased 7 percentage points since @entity38			0
' the proportion of @entity3 who say they ' do n’t know ' whether or not global warming is happening has dropped 6 points – from 20 to 14 – since @entity45			0
the researchers also say @entity3 believe that even if it exists , global warming is not their problem			0
' over years of research , we have consistently found that , on average , @entity3 view global warming as a threat distant in space and time – a risk that will affect far away places , other species , or future generations more than people here and now , ' the report says			2
' we still find this same pattern , in which fewer than half of @entity3 ( 38 % ) believe they personally will be harmed a ' moderate amount ' or a ' great deal ' by global warming			0
thick dark clouds hang over @entity68 : 23 % of @entity3 do not believe global warming is happening , it has been revealed ' people who prior said do n’t know are increasingly saying they do n't believe it , ' said @entity73 , who led the study			0
he told @entity76 media coverage surrounding the release of the @entity79 report in september may be the explanation for the shift			1
while the report made a strong case for human - caused climate change , the majority of global media coverage focused on the question of whether there has been a " pause " in global warming			1
' media frames can be really important in shaping the way people interpret the news , ' he said			0
the findings divide @entity3 into six distinct subsets			0
sixteen percent are " alarmed , " sure global warming is happening and concerned about it			2
on the opposite end of the spectrum are the " dismissive , " who comprise about 15 percent of the public and who almost all see global warming as a conspiracy theory or hoax			2
changing either of these two groups ' opinions about climate change is nearly impossible , the report found .			1

research found 63 percent do believe in climate change
53 percent are ' somewhat ' or ' very ' worried about the consequences
