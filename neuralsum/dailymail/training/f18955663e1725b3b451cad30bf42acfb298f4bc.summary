@entity5 is one of the fortunate few - he moved to his semi-detached home in @entity8 in the @entity9 at the age of one , and he is still there now , 85 years on			1
and not only does the 86 - year - old @entity14 veteran live in his parents ' house , but he also uses the same appliances that they were using decades ago			1
stability : @entity5 has lived in the red - brick semi in @entity21 , @entity8 , for 85 of his 86 years houses going up in @entity8 in the 1920s : mr @entity5 's parents were among the first to get a council house mr @entity5 remembers sheltering in the @entity28 shelter during bomb raids - now he uses it as a shed mr @entity5 is still listening to the old wireless that the family heard the outbreak of @entity34 announced on in 1939 , and the @entity35 that they used to shelter in during bombing raids is still in the garden , where it now serves as a shed			1
he said : ' i 'm very attached to this house and i love living here			0
i know lots of people in this community and would hate to move			0
' @entity5 senior never missed a week 's rent for the house , which was originally owned by @entity48 , and nor has his son , who now pays @entity50 a little more than the seven shillings and 11p it cost his father each week			2
the younger mr @entity5 , who has never married , was born half a mile away in @entity53 but moved into the red - brick house in @entity21 in 1928 as a one - year - old baby with his parents , @entity45 and @entity57			1
his father worked on the trams in the 1920s and was one of the first people in @entity8 to apply for a council house there			2
mr @entity5 , who has no children and who keeps fit by cycling 20 miles every day , said : ' i was tempted to get married once , in the 1970s or 80s , but i had mother - in - law trouble			2
staying put : mr @entity5 , a keen amateur photographer , says he can not imagine living anywhere else the house has had additions since mr @entity5 's parents knew in , including an upstairs bathroom and new wiring how it was : open land in the vicinity of where @entity21 was to be built , before construction work started mr @entity5 's house cost @entity48 £ 295 to build in between the wars - it is now worth £ 85,000 ' she and my girlfriend wanted me to move to @entity85 , a few miles away , but i opted against it because i wanted to stay here			1
' i cut it dead - and that was the reason			0
' the house was built by @entity48 at a cost of £ 295 and when mr @entity5 's father applied for it , he was told his references from the local vicar , the tramp depot and the @entity98 in which he had served during the @entity100 , were not enough - he needed a child , too			1
' so i was brought into the world , ' said mr @entity5 junior , ' and my parents were given a tenancy at a new council house in @entity21			1
' he has lived there ever since , apart from five years living in the south when he joined the @entity14 after @entity34 as a driver			2
he said : ' at the time we moved in , it was quite modern and state of the art , although of course we all had coal fires then and the bathroom was downstairs			0
parents : mr @entity5 's mother @entity117 , left , and father @entity45 , moved into the house in 1928 the air raid shelter that mr @entity5 sheltered from night raids in as a boy is still standing in his garden still going strong : the @entity14 veteran who has never married or had children , cycles 20 miles every day ' my earliest memories are of steam trains roaring past our house on the way to @entity132 , which is now @entity133			1
' i was 12 at the outbreak of @entity34 and i vividly remember the night time bombings			2
we spent many a cold night in the @entity28 shelter at the bottom of our garden , which i still use now as a shed			0
' sometimes we used to watch the @entity141 planes flying back in the moonlight over our homes , after they had carried out bombing raids in @entity146			0
' corner shop : the grocery store mr @entity5 remembers visiting as a child is still there , now run by @entity150 mr @entity5 , pictured far right , only left the house when he was serving with the @entity14 after @entity34 history : mr @entity5 's parents were among the first people to apply for a @entity8 council house mr @entity5 's parents died in 1958 but he carried on living there , watching as it was gradually modernised with the addition of an upstairs bathroom , electrical rewiring in the 1980s , and a full renovation as part of the @entity163 introduced in 2000			1
mr @entity5 is still going to the local grocery shop he 's frequented since the 1930s , when it was run by a man named @entity167			0
he said : ' it was an institution because he ran the shop in true @entity171 fashion - everything was precise , he was always well dressed and there would be religious music playing on the radio on sunday evenings			0
' mr @entity5 ’s long life at his home has now been turned into a book - ‘ the home that @entity179 ’ - by @entity50 analyst @entity180 .			0

@entity5 , 86 , moved into the house in @entity21 , @entity8 , in 1928
