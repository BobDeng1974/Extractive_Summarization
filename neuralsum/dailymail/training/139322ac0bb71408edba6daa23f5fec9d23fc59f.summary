defence secretary @entity0 has announced hundreds of @entity2 troops will be sent to @entity3 in a bid to step up the battle against @entity6 hundreds of @entity2 troops are to be sent to @entity3 next month to train locals forces in a bid to step up the battle against @entity11 extremists			1
defence secretary @entity0 said details of the contribution to an international mission were still being finalised , but the additional deployment numbered ' in the low hundreds '			1
mr @entity0 said a small protection contingent of combat - ready @entity2 soldiers would be sent to four @entity20 - led ' safe ' centres			1
the move represents a significant swelling of the 50 - strong @entity2 force presently engaged in preparing @entity3 and @entity25 fighters for a new phase of the fight to retake swathes of territory seized by the jihadis			1
@entity32 planes have been heavily involved for several months in air strikes and reconnaissance missions across @entity3 which have forced is fighters to switch tactics and lay low in towns and villages - requiring a ground offensive , mr @entity0 told the @entity40			1
but with international allies unwilling to countenance a return to ' boots on the ground ' , the focus is on ensuring local forces are sufficiently trained and equipped to mount an effective offensive against the extremists			0
a big element of the @entity2 contribution will be passing on the experience gained during the 13 - year war with the @entity53 in @entity54 in dealing with roadside bombs and other explosive devices , mr @entity0 added			2
' our role now , apart from the air strikes , is increasingly going to be on training , ' he said			0
' in particular , it will mean dealing with car and truck bombs and roadside devices , as well as basic infantry skills			0
' we have not finalised numbers yet - obviously we have got a lot of kit back from @entity54 that we can make available - but we are talking very low hundreds			2
' @entity6 fighters were ' increasingly tucked away in towns and villages ' as a result of the air strikes , he said			0
' that means they have got to be rooted out by ground troops			0
this has to be done by an own - grown army , not by western groups			0
' he stressed that the training centres - one in @entity84 and three near the @entity3 capital @entity86 - were ' not where the fighting is '			2
' they are in safe areas but obviously there 's always a small element of force protection			0
' @entity11 controls large parts of @entity3 and neighbouring @entity95 where they are waging war with the aim of establishing an @entity100 caliphate			0
@entity2 joined air strikes in september and has flown a ' huge number ' , mr @entity0 said - ' second only to the @entity20 , five times as many as @entity104 '			1
the move signals a significant swelling of the 50 - strong @entity2 force presently engaged in preparing @entity3 and @entity25 fighters in the battle to retake swathes of territory seized by @entity6			1
