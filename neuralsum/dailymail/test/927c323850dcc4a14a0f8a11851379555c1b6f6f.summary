yet another scientific study has found no link between autism and the vaccine against measles , mumps and rubella - even among high risk children			1
the findings , in the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , are based on a study of about 95,000 young people			1
all those in the study had older siblings			2
some of the elder children had autism and some did not			2
numerous studies over the last 15 years have ruled out a link between the @entity7 vaccine and autism since autism can run in families , researchers decided to look at whether vaccines could make autism even more likely in children who had siblings with autism			1
they found that vaccines had no effect on autism risk , whether or not a sibling in the family was diagnosed			1
' consistent with studies in other populations , we observed no association between @entity7 vaccination and increased @entity36 risk among privately insured children , ' said the study , led by @entity39 , a doctor in @entity40 , @entity41			2
' we also found no evidence that receipt of either one or two doses of @entity7 vaccination was associated with an increased risk of @entity36 among children who had older siblings with @entity36			1
' autism is on the rise , and affects as many as one in 68 children in the @entity53 , but its causes remain poorly understood			2
fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by @entity59			0
he was later stripped of his medical license fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by @entity59 that purported to find a link between the @entity7 vaccine and autism in 12 children			2
it was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted by the journal that published it			0
as the author , @entity59 was stripped of his medical license			0
but concerns over vaccine safety , particularly in the internet age , have proven difficult to quell			0
' although a substantial body of research over the last 15 years has found no link between the @entity7 vaccine and @entity36 , parents and others continue to associate the vaccine with @entity36 , ' said the @entity10 study			1
' surveys of parents who have children with @entity36 suggest that many believe the @entity7 vaccine was a contributing cause			0
' children who have an older sibling with autism are less likely to get vaccinated , the study found			1
the @entity7 vaccination rate for the children with unaffected siblings was 92 percent by age five			0
in contrast , the @entity7 vaccination rates for children with older siblings with @entity36 was 86 percent by age five			0
an accompanying editorial by @entity99 , a doctor at the @entity100 and @entity101 , said the data is clear			0
' the only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between mmr and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism , ' @entity99 wrote			1
' taken together , some dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of @entity36 does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children , the severity or course of @entity36 does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children , and now the risk of @entity122 in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children			0

the findings , in the @entity10 , are based on a study of about 95,000 young people
some children in the study had elder siblings with autism
but researchers found vaccines had no effect on autism risk , whether or not a sibling in the family was diagnosed
