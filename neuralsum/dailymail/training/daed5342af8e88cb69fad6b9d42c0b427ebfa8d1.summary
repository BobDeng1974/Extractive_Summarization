@entity30 accuse the @entity6 of ‘ putting tax revenues at risk ’ and warned the slip - up ‘ may just be the tip of the iceberg ’			2
the report is published as the taxman is requesting greater powers to take money directly from people ’s bank accounts when it believes tax is owed			1
@entity30 accuse the @entity6 ( headquarters pictured ) of ‘ putting tax revenues at risk ’ and warned the slip - up ‘ may just be the tip of the iceberg ’ but critics said last night that ‘ error - prone ’ @entity6 should not be given more powers until it has proved it can ‘ keep its eye on the ball ’			2
actors , doctors and judges were among those who allegedly tried to shelter £ 1.2billion through @entity12 , making it one of the biggest known tax - avoidance schemes			2

’ @entity76 mp @entity75 , who chairs the committee , said : ‘ @entity6 are missing deadlines as a result of a lack of drive , a lack of staff and a lack of a sense of urgency			0
‘ they believe £ 10 million is peanuts in the grand scheme of things , but that attitude is irresponsible			1
it is also about justice , and they should not be allowed to get away with it			0
‘ the majority of the public pay their fair share so why should some people , just because they are wealthy , treat it as a voluntary activity ? ’ @entity12 is one of many legal tax - avoidance loopholes to have been exposed in recent years , used by celebrities , doctors and judges			2
@entity107 , of the @entity108 ’ @entity106 , said : ‘ the report is right to point the finger at @entity6 but the real villains of the piece are the politicians who have created a tax code so complex that even the taxman ca n’t administer it			2

‘ the committee recognises we have addressed their key comments about tax avoidance			0
