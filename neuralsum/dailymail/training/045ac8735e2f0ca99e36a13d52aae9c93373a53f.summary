researchers from the @entity10 found that when they placed adults in a virtual body of a four - year - old , adults participating in the experiment identified with child - like attributes and began overestimating the size of objects			1
the scientists believe their research , published in @entity21 , could be used to trigger forgotten childhood memories			2
adults in child - like bodies temporarily living in a specially - designed virtual world ( pictured ) , see the world more like they did when they were young , according to @entity8 scientists as reported by @entity28 , to participate in the study , adults donned a motion - capture suit to track their body movements and a special head - mounted display to enable them to move around their new virtual world just as they would normally			1
it is generally accepted that the human brain is ' accommodating of illusory changes ' so if a person moves at the same time as their virtual character , they feel as if they are really traveling through that virtual world			0
@entity42 led the team at the university , which found that participants reacted differently in situations depending on whether they were inhabiting the virtual body of a four - year - old compared to an adult 's body merely scaled down to the same size as a child 's			1
to participate in the study , adults donned a motion - capture suit to track their body movements and a special head - mounted display to enable them to move around their new virtual world just as they would normally while ' embodiment illusions ' are known to make surrounding objects seem larger if a person is placed in a smaller virtual body , the scientists were surprised that those in a child 's body overestimated the sizes of objects to a much larger extent			1
when faced with a choice of two rooms to enter , adults in child - like bodies chose a matching room			2
they were also asked to categorise themselves as having child - like or adult - like attributes			0
those in the child 's virtual body reacted faster to child - like attributes to those in the smaller adult body			1
professor @entity42 told the @entity28 that the illusion of body ownership was responsible for the findings of the study			0
when faced with a choice of two rooms to enter , adults in child - like bodies chose a matching room			0
they were also asked to categorise themselves as having child - like or adult - like attributes ' somehow the brain thinks ' this is my body ' which makes the whole experience consistent			2
you see the world bigger , have more childlike attributes and prefer a child 's environment rather than an adult one			0
' the scientists believe that their findings could be used for therapy or recalling distant childhood memories			0
he said : ' to some extent you could revert people to a child - like experience , so they may be able to remember things from their childhood better or to empathise more with their own children			0
' more research is needed to determine if the experience will have long - term effects			0
