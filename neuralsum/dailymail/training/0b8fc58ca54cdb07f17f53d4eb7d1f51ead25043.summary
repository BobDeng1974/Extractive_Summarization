current treatments are effective at reducing levels of the disease in the bloodstream - but a drug that can ' knock out ' the disease when it lies dormant is thought to be key to a cure			1
tests on eight hiv - positive men found that the drug was highly effective in ' unmasking ' the hidden reservoirs in the body - which the researchers say is a vital step towards eradicating @entity1 from the body			1
‘ this work provides compelling evidence for a new strategy to directly attack and eradicate latent hiv infection , ’ said @entity31 at the @entity32 at @entity33			0
‘ long - term , widespread use of antiretrovirals has personal and public health consequences , including side effects , financial costs , and community resistance , ’ said @entity31 , who led the study			2
‘ we must seek other ways to end the epidemic , and this research provides new hope for a strategy to eradicate @entity1 completely from the body			1
’ the existence of persistent reservoirs of dormant @entity1 in the immune system that are not attacked by @entity57 drugs is believed to be a major reason why infection reemerges once patients stop taking their medication			1
the disruption and clearance of these reservoirs is critical to finding a cure for @entity5			0
researchers from the @entity32 at @entity33 have published pioneering research showing that a drug used to treat certain types of lymphoma was able to dislodge hidden virus in patients receiving treatment for @entity1			2
researchers at @entity32 , working in collaboration with scientists from the @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , and the @entity80 , undertook a series of experiments designed to evaluate the potential of the drug vorinostat , a deacetylase inhibitor that is used to treat some types of lymphoma , to activate and disrupt the dormant virus			0
initially , laboratory experiments measuring active @entity1 levels in @entity91 + t cells , which are specialized white blood cells that the virus uses to replicate , showed that vorinostat unmasked the hidden virus in these cells			2
subsequently , vorinostat was administered to eight @entity1 - infected men who were medically stable on antiretroviral therapy and the levels of active hiv virus were measured and compared to the levels prior to administration			1
those patients receiving vorinostat showed an average 4.5-fold increase in the levels of @entity107 in @entity91 + t cells , evidence that the virus was being unmasked			0
this is the first published study to show the potential for deacetylase inhibitors to attack latency within dormant virus pools in a translational clinical study			0
targeting latency is the first step on a path that may lead to a cure .			0
