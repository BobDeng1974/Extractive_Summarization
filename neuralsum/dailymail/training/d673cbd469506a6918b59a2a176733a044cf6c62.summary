@entity1 's miserable start to his @entity3 career has continued with news that he faces a further two weeks out with injury			1
the @entity7 international must impress manager @entity8 over the course of the season if his big - money loan at @entity12 is to be turned in to a permanent deal at the end of the year			1
however , as @entity3 prepared for a trip to @entity17 on saturday with crippling injury problems across their defensive line , the long - term future of centre forward @entity1 continues to be in doubt			1
@entity1 ( right ) pictured in action for @entity3 against @entity22 in september @entity1 ( left ) was unveiled with @entity23 ( right ) on arrival at @entity12 - both are now injured @entity3 boss @entity26 said last night : ' no , he 's not available			1
he has an injury and that takes time			1
' now it 's four weeks already and next week he shall train with our selection and then he needs two weeks			2
it 's always like that			2
' it 's a pity , but players in football are injured			2
' @entity37 revealed earlier this month that @entity26 already has doubts about @entity1 's ability to withstand a long @entity41 season			1
certainly , statistics that show just one goal and three league starts already go some way to showing why the @entity3 manager is concerned			1
having let @entity48 striker @entity47 go to saturday 's opponents at the end of the summer transfer window , @entity26 knows that decision could come back to embarrass him at the @entity53 but insists he does not regret his decision			2
@entity7 played at @entity55 last friday , and @entity1 was in attendance to watch his team - mates ' he could have also played for @entity3 but we have decided that he could go and he has taken the benefit of it , ' said @entity26			1
' he does very good at @entity17			2
now i shall see him [ play ] and i shall judge him			2
' he has taken all the benefits of playing every week			0
that was always the question mark here			0
' but i do n't think it is so important how i judge him because he is now playing for @entity17			0
' he 's not a @entity3 player anymore so now we have to beat him also			1
he 's not alone , we have to beat @entity17			0
' @entity26 has had better news this week regarding goalkeeper @entity70 who has recovered from a dislocated finger suffered on international duty and will play on saturday			0
@entity8 claimed he is ' always a worried man in @entity73 ' , because of his side 's injury problems @entity70 dislocated his finger on international duty but has recovered in time to face @entity17 on saturday @entity78 injury problems however , @entity3 will be without first choice defenders @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and perhaps @entity85			1
@entity86 international midfielder @entity23 , meanwhile , will not know the extent of his knee injury suffered playing for @entity89 until he removes a brace in 10 days ' time			2
' it 's difficult to say how long because he is still sitting in his brace , ' said @entity26			0
' we will then scan him again			0
' it is not as bad as the doctors thought after the first match but it could still be a long story			0
it is n't six months or so , though			0
' @entity3 winger @entity100 will play at @entity17 after recovering from a knock he picked up playing for @entity102 on tuesday			1
