by @entity0 thought the side boob was bad ? cringed at the concept of a ' bumster ' dress , which exposes your bottom cleavage a la @entity6 ? well , it just got a whole lot worse			1
the latest fashion trend sweeping the red carpet - thanks to @entity6 , @entity11 and @entity12 - is the ' almost naked ' look , which , as the name suggests , exposes acres of flesh			1
@entity11 was the most recent celebrity to embrace the trend when she dressed to shock as she hit the red carpet at the @entity19 in @entity20 on sunday			1
the 18 - year - old reality star chose a white embellished long - sleeved @entity41 gown featuring elaborate embellishment in the form of jewels			2
even her little sister @entity45 , 16 , seemed rather surprised by the daring choice - pointing at it in wonder as the pair posed for photographers ahead of hosting the awards show			2
@entity11 looked nonchalant despite her revealing gown - perhaps due to her experience as a catwalk model			2
indeed , she took to @entity54 later in the evening to share some photos of her daring frock , which she captioned : ' why do one slit when you can do two ! ? # @entity19			0
' would you dare to bare ? @entity6 was the a-lister who took the trend to a whole new level when she arrived at the @entity62 's in a fishnet gown the gown was otherwise gorgeous with its striking silver and gold jewelled detailing on the bodice , all the way down the centre of the outfit as well as along the sleeves			1
and @entity11 is n't alone in her choice of barely - there red carpet style			1
@entity6 , who was named ' @entity75 ' at the recent @entity62 awards , was the centre of attention at the @entity80 event when she stepped out in a daring , totally sheer embellished halter dress which showed off every inch of her slim figure			1
the revealing outfit was custom - made by designer @entity86 and comprised of a total of 216,000 @entity89 crystals			2
trial on trend : supermodel @entity12 has also given the practically naked trend a whirl , a new fashion statement that one stylist says ' worries her ' the singer completed her look with a blinged - out @entity86 headscarf and gloves			0
speaking about @entity11 and @entity6 's fashion statement , @entity101 's @entity100 , who spotted the trend , said : ' the question here is n't just of changing mores , but of taste			1
the red carpet is after all a professional environment rather than say , a strip club			1
by so obviously " going commando " and revealing her hipbones , @entity11 is clearly trying to court controversy			2
' perhaps in a world in which @entity117 works a front wedgie and sideboob is acceptable for the office , such reservations are dated			0
' other celebrities to court the look have included daring @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity12 and , of course , @entity117			1
she 's a fan of it too ! @entity128 and model @entity123 wore a daring slashed gown just like @entity11 's @entity133 's resident fashion expert , @entity132 , said : ' there 's a very fine line between showing too much of yourself and still remaining chic , and unfortunately most celebs get it wrong			1
' if we wanted to see bums , nipples and pokey out hip bones we could all take a trip to our local strip club and watch @entity145 do her thing on a pole			0
' i would go for the naked look , nothing gets the blood pumping more than a bit of skin ! ' - @entity154 , 25 , @entity155 ' i think it ’s really try - hard			0
surely it ’s sexier to wonder what ’s underneath rather than have it thrust in your face from the word go			0
guys like the chase and a bit of mystery			0
it ’s like sex without foreplay			0
' - @entity170 , 25 , @entity155 ' @entity6 took it way too far at the @entity172 in that sheer dress			1
it was classless and cheap ( even though there were thousands of tiny crystals stitched onto it )			0
@entity178 got an eyeful of nipple			0
' there 's ways to show off your body ... @entity185 created sheer panelled dresses that looked exquisite			2
i 'm not a fan of seeing jutting hip bones and an untidy wax			0
cover up a bit ladies ! ' celebrity stylist @entity194 said : ' the " practically naked " trend worries me			0
not only is it becoming a competition on the red carpet as to who can bare more , but it seems to be sticking around for @entity200			1
' the @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 winter catwalk shows were full of long sheer dresses perfect for appearing in public semi-naked			0
' to me there is nothing elegant about this look , it leaves little to the imagination and it does n’t set a very good example to fans of the stars who do n’t have the luxury of stepping out at night surrounded by bodyguards			0
' i 'm hoping this trend does n’t hit the high street and we leave the celebrities to it , as this trend is definitely not for " real people " as we say in the @entity223			2
' famous fans : even the usually demure @entity124 , left , has experimented with the flesh - baring trend while @entity117 , right , is never one to shy away from flashing some skin hitting the high street : the trend is seeping into stores , with this £ 65 fishnet dress by @entity232 for @entity233 bound to cause a stir filtering through : fresh off the catwalks , the near naked trend is hitting online retailers such as @entity238 but will you dare to embrace it ?			1
