an eyewitness who saw the killing of @entity2 at the hands of officer @entity4 has revealed his version of events leading up to the fatal shooting			1
the man , whose name has been withheld , from @entity10 , @entity11 , says that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when @entity4 shot at him , but rather ' out to his sides			1
' he also said @entity2 ' staggered toward @entity4 despite commands to stop ' and that ' the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired			1
and while he would not detail exactly what he told the grand jury when speaking with the @entity41 , he did say the that the ' members seemed fair and asked a lot of questions			2
' another critical piece the man shared was that the officer did not fire until @entity2 turned back toward him			2
he says that @entity2 and his friend were walking down the middle of the street when @entity4 pulled up to them and they exchanged some words , which he could not hear			2
@entity4 then pulled up in front of the boys and then backed up his car , when a ' tussle ' occurred on the passenger side which the witness could not see			1
then a shot was fired - he does not say whether or not is was intentional - and he saw @entity2 run down the street , followed by @entity4 , who was yelling at the 18 - year - old to ' stop ! ' the young man @entity2 was with , @entity63 , ran the other way according to the witness			1
then , after being told to stop a few more times , @entity2 turned around and took a step towards @entity4			2
slogan : some have claimed @entity2 said to the officer , ' hands up do n't shoot , ' which has led many protestors to use that as their chant ( above ) coming out : there have been numerous rallies in the @entity10 area since the august 9 shooting ' when he stepped foot on that street , the officer told him to stop again , and he fired three shots , ' said the witness			1
' when he got hit , he staggered like , " oh , " and his body moved			0
' he added , ' his hands were up like this ( he gestures with arms out to the side and palms upward ) , and he was looking at the officer and was coming toward him trying to keep his feet and stand up			0
the officer took a few steps back and yelled , " stop , " again , and @entity2 was trying to stay on his feet			0
' at this point he says @entity2 was 20 to 25 feet away and staggering			0
' as he was firing those last rounds , @entity2 was on his way down			0
we were thinking , " @entity97 , oh my @entity99 , brother , stop , stop			0
" he was already on his way down when he fired those last shots			0
' the witness also said @entity4 did nâ€™t have to kill @entity2			1
' it went from zero to 100 like that , in the blink of an eye			0
... what transpired to us , in my eyesight , was murder			0
' people claiming to have witnessed the august 9 shooting of @entity2 have given wildly different accounts of what happened , with some saying the young man had his arms raised over his head and that @entity4 shot him while his back was turned and he was running , and the police saying the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun .			1

a witness who testified in front of the grand jury about the shooting of teenager @entity2 says the teen was approaching officer when shot
he also said that @entity2 *'s* hands were ' to the side ' and not raised above his head when the *incident* occurred in @entity135 , @entity11 on august 9
the witness still calls the shooting by officer @entity4 ' outright murder '
