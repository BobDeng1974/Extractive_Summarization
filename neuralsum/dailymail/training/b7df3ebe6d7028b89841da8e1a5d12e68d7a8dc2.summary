by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:48 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 14:27 est , 3 july 2013 @entity3 has imposed £ 5billion worth of new red tape on @entity5 in just two years , a damning new analysis reveals today			1
new laws , regulations and rules form @entity9 have cost the equivalent of £ 9,500 every minute since the start of 2011			1
the revelation sparked claims that @entity5 families were bearing the cost of @entity17 diktats slipped through the ‘ backdoor with little scrutiny ’			2
red tape : regulations from the @entity24 and other @entity3 institutions has lead to the introduction of 75 new directives estimated to cost @entity5 £ 5billion , new figures show around 250 new measures were introduced to @entity5 as a result of rules from @entity9 institutions in 2011 and 2012			1
of these , 74 imposed additional costs of £ 5billion to taxpayers and businesses			2
they included more than £ 800million on green fuels , £ 250million from packaging and recycling demands and £ 800million forcing self - employed drivers to cut the hours they work			1
the biggest single cost was from regulations introduced after the @entity41 banned insurance companies from charging lower premiums for women drivers			2
the amendments to the @entity46 cost an extra £ 923million			1
the @entity47 said the figures do not include the benefits of the regulations or the wider advantages of @entity5 's membership of the @entity53			1
but @entity55 mp @entity54 , who compiled the data , said : ‘ new red tape from @entity9 is strangling @entity5 businesses , placing a significant impact upon our economy and adding huge costs to @entity5 ’s hard - pressed families			1
‘ these rules are being imposed through the backdoor with little scrutiny or opportunities to amend them or scrap them			2
’ environmental permitting regulations 2011 £ 80million waste regulations 2011 £ 81.3million over 10 years @entity73 and merchant shipping regulations 2010 £ 423million over 10 years @entity74 2011 £ 215million over 24 years toys safety regulations 2011 £ 230million over 10 years electricity and gas regulations 2011 £ 184.1million over 21 years @entity79 2011 £ 133million equality act 2010 regulations ( insurance for female drivers ) 2012 £ 923.2 million packaging waste regulations 2012 £ 249.6million over 5 years @entity84 2011 £ 809million over 18 years @entity86 ( working time ) regulations 2012 £ 806million over 10 years control of @entity88 2012 £ 191.5million over 10 years @entity90 ( residence permits for third - country nationals ) £ 103 million restriction of the @entity94 in @entity95 and electronic equipment regulations 2012 £ 768million over 15 years the revelation comes ahead of the first commons debate on @entity55 plans to hold a referendum on @entity5 ’s membership of the @entity53			1
conservative backbencher @entity100 is using a @entity101 to try to legislate for a vote to be held by the end of 2017 , but @entity104 and the @entity105 are opposed to the idea			0
ms @entity54 added : ‘ the @entity5 people are fed up with @entity9 ’s unaccountable bureaucrats and judges meddling in their way of life and expect mps to stand up for the @entity5 interest by voting for a referendum on our membership of the @entity53			1
‘ in advance of the referendum , ministers throughout @entity118 need to do more to stop this country being blackmailed by @entity9 ’s unaccountable bureaucratic elite			2
’ ms @entity54 tabled a series of parliamentary questions asking every government department which regulations they had been forced to introduce by @entity9			1
she then analysed official impact assessments to put a price tag on each measure , which revealed the £ 5billion cost in just two years			1
the order to force self - employed drivers to comply with @entity134 rules was imposed at a cost of £ 806million over 10 years , despite the government admitting ‘ evidence suggest that no problem exists in the @entity5 regarding road safety and self - employed drivers ’			1
a spokesman for the @entity47 said : ' first , the @entity47 only ever proposes legislation where its impact assessment clearly shows that overall benefits – not reflected in ms @entity54 ’s figures - outweigh the cost			1
' the @entity5 supported most of the regulations listed so clearly came to the same conclusion - that benefits outweighed costs			1
' for example , most jurisdictions – @entity5 , @entity53 and worldwide - agree that there should be strong rules on hazardous substances and toy safety , even if it costs manufacturers money to minimise the risk that their products kill or maim children			1
' the @entity5 government ( @entity163 ) has estimated the benefits deriving from the single market alone at up to £ 92billion every year , therefore a huge multiple of ms @entity54 ’s debatable figure for the alleged costs of @entity90			1
' mr @entity169 has promised to renegotiate a ' fresh settlement ' with @entity3 if he is prime minister after the 2015 election , before holding an in - out referendum mr @entity100 's @entity173 , drawn up by @entity174 , says that a referendum ‘ must be held before 31 december 2017 ’ , and says a cabinet minister must bring forward parliament orders which name the date by the end of 2016			1
clash : @entity169 has promised an in - out referendum after reaching a new deal with @entity3 but @entity183 dismissed the @entity55 policy of an ‘ ill - defined process of so - called renegotiation ’ law : @entity55 mp @entity100 will lead a debate on his @entity189 in the @entity190 on friday but a briefing paper by the @entity190 library says it means the legislation as it stands is not legally binding and more parliamentary votes will be needed on ‘ the detailed rules for the poll and the date ’			1
the issue has caused a major coalition row , with the prime minister claiming @entity183 's @entity105 ' have to get off the fence ' and back giving the @entity5 public a say			0
but this week mr @entity183 said that he thought @entity5 was best placed in the @entity53 and the @entity105 are the ‘ the party of in '			0
mean while the @entity207 were ‘ increasingly becoming the party of out ’			0
mr @entity183 claimed the @entity55 position has ‘ swerved around enormously in recent months and years , noting that mr @entity169 ’s ‘ cast - iron pledge ’ to hold a referendum on the @entity210 had not been kept			1
he dismissed mr @entity169 's ‘ ill - defined process of so - called renegotiation ’ , accusing him of plucking the 2017 date out of thin air			2
the coalition had already legislated to ensure that there would be an in - out referendum the next time there was a major @entity219			1
critic : @entity55 mp @entity54 , who compiled the figures , said @entity9 red tape is strangling @entity5 businesses @entity5 ’s national interest is not being served by our current membership of the @entity53			1
this unaccountable and bureaucratic juggernaut , driven by its dogmatic commitment to ‘ ever closer union ’ , has gained an insatiable appetite for crushing national democracies and circumventing democracy			0
throughout the laws which affect hardworking families and business we can see the carnage that @entity9 ’s bureaucrats and judges have caused			0
ridiculous laws have hit our economy hard and are stifling growth and job creation			0
the @entity243 prevents the @entity244 from treating patients			0
green energy rules are adding billions of pounds to energy bills			2
£ 5 billion of new regulatory costs have been burdened on this country in the last two years			2
while we have lost control of our immigration system and been compelled to accept millions of new foreigners and asylum seekers into @entity5 , taxpayers have been forced to stump up £ 19.2 billion a year to fill the @entity53 ’s bloated coffers			2
the @entity53 is not the peace - loving , free trade paradise sold to the @entity5 people in the 1970s			2
it is an organisation desperate to drain more powers from nation states and , as we have seen with the @entity263 crisis , dictate how countries should be run			0
the president of the @entity47 has made no secret of his wish to see @entity9 even more tightly integrated , under the auspices of the @entity47			2
@entity5 can not afford to be dragged more closely into @entity9 ’s orbit it is the responsibility of @entity24 to exercise its sovereignty and facilitate the repatriation of powers through a referendum			0
just as the @entity5 people have been proven to make the right decisions about how they should be governed in the past , they should be trusted to do so in the future			0
they should be able to decide who makes the laws that affect them and be trusted to pass their judgement on the control the @entity53 exerts on our immigration system , farming and fisheries policies			0
now is the time to let the people decide whether they wish to reject membership of the @entity53 and instead reaffirm the principle that @entity5 laws should be made by @entity5 people in @entity5			0
this is why friday ’s vote on in the @entity190 on the @entity189 is so important and has the potential to be a defining moment in the history of @entity5 democracy			0
members of @entity24 have an opportunity to send out a powerful and decisive statement to the public and to the @entity53 about how @entity5 should be governed			0
with a strong turnout in @entity24 and vote in support of the @entity189 , @entity5 will be one step closer to putting to an end four decades of centralisation and power - grabbing by @entity9 ’s political elite			0
but , despite this opportunity to empower the @entity5 people , it is shameful that @entity104 and @entity105 mps are planning to abstain			0
the fact that the two parties who conspired five years ago to deny us the referendum promised on the @entity210 still do not trust the @entity5 people to decide is not surprising			0
but it is astounding that when we live in an era where referendums have become commonplace and are used to decide everything from endorsing a local neighbourhood development plan to changing the @entity328 voting system that @entity104 and @entity105 dub this referendum a ‘ stunt ’ and ‘ gimmick ’			0
only those afraid to put their arguments in favour of the @entity53 to the people would hold them in such contempt			0
as well as facing the disparaging attitude of @entity104 and the @entity105 , those who back a referendum have received a hostile reception from the @entity47 and its president			1
they prefer to scaremonger the public			0
but those in @entity5 and in @entity9 who stand in the way of letting the @entity5 people decide their own destiny are on the wrong side of the argument .			0

study by @entity55 mp @entity54 uncovers 250 new rules in 2011 and 2012
official impact assessments reveal cost equivalent to £ 9,500 - a - minute
revelations come ahead of @entity358 on in - out referendum
@entity47 *insists* benefits of @entity3 are much *higher*
