@entity2 personality and former @entity3 governor @entity0 stunned a @entity5 crowd on saturday by likening the federal government 's treatment of airport passengers to the totalitarian regime of @entity10			1
' my gosh , i 'm beginning to think that there 's more freedom in @entity15 sometimes than there is in the @entity17 , ' he told a partisan crowd at the inaugural @entity5 @entity19			1
' when i go to the airport , i have to get into the surrender position , people put hands all over me , and i have to provide photo id in a couple of different forms to prove that i 'm not going to terrorize the airplane , ' he deadpanned			0
in a speech filled with jokes , @entity0 seemed deadly serious			1
trouble : @entity0 drew a mix of gasps and applause when he suggested that airport security represents a loss of freedom akin to @entity15 's ' more freedom ' : @entity0 compared @entity17 ' treatment in domestic airports to the @entity15 government 's treatment of its people ' surrender position ' : @entity17 airline passengers can expect occasional pat - downs from @entity45 ( @entity45 ) agents before they are allowed into boarding areas @entity17 welcomed additional security measures after the 9/11 terror attacks but have since grown weary of agents who get up close and personal his criticism of the @entity52 was a segue into his objection to the national debate of voter id requirements at the polls			1
' if i want to go vote , i do n't need a thing , ' he said			0
' all i got ta to do is show up and i can give ' em anybody 's name , and that 's okay			2
' the laughs returned when he quipped that ' the president reminded us yesterday that there 's no voter fraud			2
' @entity70 said friday during a speech to @entity75 host @entity74 's @entity73 pressure group that claims of widespread voter fraud – the justification offered by conservatives for laws requiring photo ids at the polls – are ' bogus			1
' ' let 's be clear , ' @entity70 said			2
: ' the real voter fraud is people who try to deny our rights by making bogus arguments about voter fraud			0
' @entity0 is an ordained @entity89 minister and sometimes musician who served as the governor of @entity3 for 11 years and now hosts a weekend variety show on the @entity2			1
he mounted an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2008 , and his name has surfaced again as a possible 2016 @entity96 candidate			1
but even if he never reaches @entity97 , he joked that he might show up there unannounced one day for a tour			0
when the @entity99 asked him for a photo id , he said , he would say , ' i figured if i can vote without one , i ought to be able to come in and look around without one too			0
' conservatives at the inaugural @entity5 @entity19 in @entity103 turned the parking lot into a carnival of political bumper stickers , including this nod to the tea party @entity109 : fresh from his speech at the 2014 @entity5 @entity19 , @entity0 met with reporters for a brief press conference really ? @entity15 communist leader @entity10 presides over one of the world 's most repressive totalitarian regimes , imprisoning millions of his people and restricting economic activity and travel @entity0 complained about having to produce a government - issued @entity119 in order to pass through airport security -- a measure that 's not required when @entity17 visit the polls on @entity125 @entity0 ended a day full of conservative speakers including former house speaker @entity127 , business tycoon @entity128 , and @entity17 senators @entity129 , @entity131 and @entity132			1
nearly everyone took shots at the @entity135 , which has raised @entity137 ' collective blood pressure since news broke 11 months ago that the agency was playing political favorites and targeting right - wing organizations for special scrutiny			2
mercurial : @entity0 's audience knows him as a jovial figure and a sensible television host , but the buzz in @entity5 reflected a consensus that he had gone too far @entity0 scowled at ' the criminal enterprise formerly known as the @entity135 ... that is able to crush any citizen , any organization			1
' ' it is the one type of entity in @entity17 , ' he complained , ' where you are guilty until you can prove yourself to be not guilty			0
' a shift in the law away from income taxes , and toward taxes on sales and consumption – what advocates call the @entity165 – ' would rid us of the @entity135 , ' he said			2
later , @entity0 told @entity167 that he 's serious about doing away with the @entity135 entirely			1
' most states have their own taxing authority and tax auditing capability , ' @entity0 said			1
' it could be handled with the states			0
' ' when i look at what they have become , and threat that they are to the liberty of @entity17 , it 's very frightening to me			2
' ' for them to take personal , confidential information of taxpayers , or groups , and to share that information illegally in a way to try to hurt those individuals and groups ? that 's criminal , ' he added			0
' we should n't be sponsoring , paying for , subsidizing and legislating a criminal enterprise			0
@entity167 asked if there were other federal agencies that he thought should be scrapped			0
' i 'm not a candidate , ' he cautioned			0
' so let me hold off on giving you the full platform			0

@entity0 is a *preacher* , a former @entity3 governor , a @entity2 host and a potential presidential candidate
he brought up the rear in a cattle - call of politicians *angling* for early *momentum* in the 2016 race
he 's known as a *social* - issues *crusader* , but *branched* out into other red - meat conservative issues
the *unusual* comparison with @entity15 lit up *republicans* on @entity215 , with nearly all of them saying he had gone too far
