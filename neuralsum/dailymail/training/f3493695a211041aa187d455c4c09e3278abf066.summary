' ' i hope that they ’ll accept it , ' @entity5 said of the letter			0
@entity5 was nearly executed in 2006 before a late court - ordered reprieve after revelations about problems with the state 's lethal injection practices at that time			1
on tuesday night , the string of terse denials , issued for the high court by justice @entity131 , presumably cleared the way for @entity5 's execution to proceed as scheduled			2
@entity70 was waiting for the school bus on the morning of march 22 , 1989 , when @entity73 and @entity5 , then in their early 20s , drove past in a car they had stolen after a night while binging on crack cocaine			1
one of the men jumped out of the car and grabbed @entity70 , forcing her into the vehicle			0
both have claimed the other did it			0
the men drove to the home of @entity73 's mother			0
@entity70 was forced into the basement and raped — dna testing linked @entity5			1
afraid she would be able to identify them , the men used kitchen knives to stab the girl repeatedly , even as @entity70 begged for her life and offered money if they would let her live			0
she died about 30 minutes later			0
@entity5 and @entity73 put her in the trunk of the stolen car , abandoned the car in a neighborhood then walked away			2
the body was found three days later			0

after their sentences were overturned , they were again sentenced to death in 1994			0
@entity73 is also on death row , but the state has yet to schedule his execution			1
@entity172 , @entity5 's mother , issued a statement with other family members stating @entity5 had great remorse for his crime			1
the family did not want to see @entity5 executed and @entity172 has said that life in prison should have been be sufficient punishment			1
