by @entity1 reporter the archbishop 's remarks will fuel criticism of welfare reforms families have been left ‘ broken and weeping ’ by hunger and debt despite the country ’s economic recovery , the archbishop of @entity7 will say in his @entity15 sermon today			1
in outspoken remarks that will refuel attacks on the government ’s welfare policies , archbishop @entity16 will say many struggling families are ‘ too ashamed ’ to seek help from food banks , which critics claim are increasingly filling a gap created by benefit cuts			1
his sermon in @entity28 follows a letter from 600 religious leaders , including more than 40 @entity32 bishops , urging @entity33 to tackle a ‘ national crisis ’ of rising hunger as the latest figures suggest more than a million @entity37 have used food banks in the past year			1
although the letter was not signed by @entity16 , his remarks will be seen as endorsing its concerns			2
preaching about @entity44 ’s tears after discovering @entity46 ’s empty tomb , the archbishop also refers to the suffering of communities			2
he will say : ‘ with @entity44 there are so many that weep			0
‘ in @entity53 , mothers cry for their children and husbands			0
in the @entity57 , neighbours cry because the future is precarious and dangerous			0
in @entity60 , tears are still shed each day as the horror of genocide is remembered			0
in this country , even as the economy improves , there is weeping in broken families , in people ashamed to seek help from food banks , or frightened by debt			1
asylum seekers weep with loneliness and missing far - away families			0
@entity44 continues to weep across the world			0
’ but the archbishop will go on to say @entity46 ’s resurrection brings hope and joy , which can ‘ exist alongside mental illness , depression , bereavement and fear ’ and that ‘ joy in the huge life of @entity46 is present in the food banks , the credit unions , the practical down - to - earth living that the churches are demonstrating across this country ’ .			1
