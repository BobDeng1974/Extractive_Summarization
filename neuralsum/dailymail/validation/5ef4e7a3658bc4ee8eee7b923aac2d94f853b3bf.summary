at first glance , it looks like any other f - 16 fighter jet - except for one difference			0
@entity5 's new @entity4 is a actually a retired @entity7 air force jet converted into a drone			1
the pilotless plane can be controlled from the ground , and will used for target practice by ' top gun ' pilots			1
126 of the converted planes will be used by the @entity21 as flying targets to train top gun pilots			1
length : 49 ft , 5 in			0
span : 32 ft , 8 in			0
takeoff weight : 37,500 lbs @entity26 : 1,500 mph @entity26 altitude : 50,000 ft plus range : 2,425 mi engine : one 27,000 - lb - thrust @entity31 the first production @entity36 - 16 optionally manned target drone has been delivered to the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , @entity33 bosses have revealed			1
@entity37 arrived at @entity38 ( afb ) in @entity40 on 11 march , ahead of being pressed into service by the @entity42 ( @entity42 )			0
@entity5 has delivered six pre-production @entity43 , and in all , the @entity21 expects to receive 126 qf - 16s			1
the unmanned @entity46 currently used is no longer truly representative of the air - to - air threats @entity21 pilots are likely to encounter on future operations			1
the @entity4 will be able to represent threats in the class of the @entity53 ' @entity53 ' and @entity54 ' , bosses say			1
in tests , two @entity7 @entity21 test pilots in a ground control station at @entity57 remotely flew the @entity36 - 16 , which is a retired f - 16 jet modified to be an aerial target			1
while in the air , the @entity36 - 16 mission included a series of simulated maneuvers , reaching supersonic speeds , returning to base and landing , all without a pilot in the cockpit			0
' it was a little different to see it without anyone in it , but it was a great flight all the way around , ' said @entity7 air force lt. col. @entity75 , commander , @entity42			2
' it 's a replication of current , real world situations and aircraft platforms they can shoot as a target			0
now we have a 9g capable , highly sustainable aerial target			0
' for more than 40 years , the @entity84 has proven itself as the world 's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter , serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world			2
the drones have been adapted from @entity84 jets that have been retired by the @entity21			1
the @entity4 is a retired @entity84 ( pictured ) turned in a remote controlled drone			1
the @entity21 has ordered 126 craft to be used as ' target drones '			1
for more than 40 years , the @entity84 has proven itself as the world 's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter , serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world			2
the @entity84 's most innovative design feature is its ' fly - by - wire ' control system , the first on any aircraft			2
the @entity84 is designed to maneuver at up to nine g 's			2
this allows it to turn tighter than other fighters , a big advantage in a dogfight			0
but at such high g - loadings , the pilot is crushed down into his seat by almost a ton of force , and can barely lift a finger			0
so the @entity84 has a small side - mounted control stick on an armrest			0
instead of moving back and forth , the @entity84 's fixed joystick responds to hand pressure			0
in a tight , high - g turn , an otherwise immobilized f - 16 pilot can literally fly with the twitch of a finger .			0

@entity7 @entity21 has ordered 126 craft to be used as ' target drones '
@entity84 able to offer ' realistic threat ' similar to the @entity53
will be controlled by operators on the ground during simulations
