whether @entity1 ’s reign as the host of @entity4 chat show the @entity5 is a success in the long - run remains to be seen , but his debut last night proved one thing categorically : @entity1 has arrived			1
@entity1 ’s career has already seen him co-star in a @entity13 film with @entity14 and @entity15 and win a @entity16 for his performances on @entity18 beating @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21			2
this made those look like amateur dramatics			0
as major as they are , they were almost incidental			0
the devil was in the detail			0
to say @entity40 were determined to @entity42 ’s arrival and put him on the map is an understatement			0
the president of @entity40 himself , @entity46 , appeared in a segment bestowing upon @entity1 the opportunity of the job in the manner of a @entity53 a la @entity52			2
several big names also made fleeting appearances trying to find it and get the gig too , with such illustrious stars as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , and oscar - winner @entity64 reduced to the status of @entity1 's supporting cast			1
other cameos came from @entity68 , @entity69 as his personal trainer , @entity70 knocking him about a bit , and @entity15 giving him a pep talk using lyrics from @entity74			0
there was probably a celebrity kitchen sink in there too			0
it ’s little wonder @entity1 was overwhelmed			2
so many members of the public and the media have given their opinion over the past few weeks on whether @entity1 will cut it that judging him after only one programme seems almost reasonable			2
but hey that ’s showbiz			0
@entity1 himself has been around long enough to know that			2
welcome : celebrity guests @entity35 and @entity34 were almost incidental in last nights proceedings @entity1 managed to secure an exclusive from actress @entity35 with the news that she had already married @entity94 at 36 he ’s younger than his rivals on other networks and never even presented a chat show before but he ’s been building up to this moment since the days he appeared in a @entity100 ad and an episode of @entity102 15 years ago			1
his first episode presenting the @entity5 must go down as a success			1
besides delivering the likes of @entity34 , @entity15 , and @entity107 , @entity105 secured an exclusive from @entity35 with the news that she had married @entity94 – even though the revelation was probably rehearsed rather than spontaneous			1
the parodies with @entity34 also showed @entity1 in his element – being funny , and clearly having a great time			1
nonetheless , watching @entity1 bounce out on to the set for his much - discussed debut , like a boisterous , @entity117 tigger and nervously tap his question cards while he gabbled to @entity34 and @entity35 , made you worry whether he can add being an @entity4 chat show host to his repertoire			1
opening sketch : @entity1 started the show with a sketch showing him winning the ' golden ticket ' advise : former chat show host @entity70 imparted some words of wisdom to the 36 - year - old father - of - two at the start of the show you even almost felt sorry for him			1
this is a strange thing to say and somewhat ironic , considering the self - confessed “ chunky unit ” from @entity134 is not so much living the @entity135 as fulfilling the fantasy of every ambitious actor , comedian , and tv presenter across the globe			2
you did n’t envy him			0
but you had to admire his courage			0
after all , there are no audiences more demanding or instantly unforgiving than the critics or viewers of @entity4 television			0
and the nightly , late - night , talk show is one of the great staples of @entity4 television – a tradition that made the likes of @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity70 , and @entity156 among the most famous stars in the country , making their weekly @entity117 equivalents @entity159 , @entity160 , and even @entity161 look like part - timers			1
@entity1 represents a risky choice , even without the minor detail that he has never presented a chat show before			1
true , @entity1 is taking over the @entity5 from another relatively obscure @entity167 @entity166 , whose reign lasted an impressive / incredible ten years			1
but as @entity170 found out when he succeeded @entity172 legend @entity171 , these are different times			0
the appointment of an @entity175 star now causes instant controversy with @entity4 audiences and the @entity4 press not to mention jealousy from other comedians or presenters			0
@entity69 was among a host of celebrities making a fleeting appearance in the show @entity186 - winning actress @entity15 assured the @entity117 comic that he was ready for his big break in @entity4 emmy award winning actress @entity189 also gave @entity1 her support in the opening show @entity68 was also on hand to provide some last minutes pearls of wisdom to the @entity117 star fellow @entity167 and oscar - winner @entity64 made a fleeting appearance on the screen @entity1 ’s biggest dilemma is whether he should play safe or whether he needs to be more edgy			1
another issue is how much of a twist @entity1 can give such a well - established format			1
@entity4 ’ fondness for @entity154 , @entity156 , @entity70 , and @entity166 ’s @entity5 has been based on a familiarity established over decades			1
they were essentially the same every night			0
on the other hand , the likes of @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , and @entity210 have thrived thanks to their subversive , satirical , bite and unpredictability			0
so far @entity1 has hedged his bets			2
his version of the @entity5 sticks faithfully to the formula of a house band , smooth comic monologue , and sketches			2
but there have already been rumours that some celebrities and their prs are unhappy with the major change @entity1 and his @entity117 producer have introduced – bringing the guests out on to the sofa at the same time and chatting to them together			1
this was a feature of the @entity230 but faded in favour of giving stars the spotlight , being recently revived in this country by @entity160			0
@entity1 is young , largely unknown , and a novice - prompting several cries on @entity4 forums and social media of ‘ who ? ’ in theory , his position gives him a chance to start from scratch , and make a name for himself as a distinctive original like fellow @entity245 abroad , @entity246 , @entity247 , and @entity248			1
@entity1 paid tribute to his parents who were in the audience of his debut show after travelling over from the @entity117 the problem is , this is not @entity1 ’s style			1
in fact , @entity1 ’s main handicap may be the characteristic that is usually his biggest asset			2
despite his clearly prodigious talents , @entity1 ’s appeal has always been based on his everyday charm , gregarious enthusiasm , and evident excitement at what he ’s doing			2
but it ’s hard to imagine that @entity4 will tolerate any repeats of @entity1 ’s excruciatingly sycophantic interview with @entity267 and star - struck sketches with @entity269			2
during his years presenting @entity274 , the way @entity1 ’s been in awe of cricket star @entity271 and co. hardly bodes well for coping with @entity4 ’s a list			1
after all , the @entity5 is not breakfast television			0
the clue ’s in the name ... it ’s true that his lovable cheek was such a hit in the @entity18 production of one man , two @entity285 that he won a @entity16 , but you doubt his arrival will really be what one @entity40 presenter helpfully hyped as ‘ the next step on the evolution of late night comedy			0
’ for a sketch @entity1 played dress - up with @entity34 as they parodied some of the actor 's best loved movies the sketches gave @entity1 the chance to do what he does best , ' @entity300 it up ' and ' play the fool ' @entity1 ' gave it his all ' during the opening show as he attempted to win over the @entity4 audience big performance : @entity1 ’s appeal has always been based on his everyday charm , gregarious enthusiasm , and evident excitement at what he ’s doing @entity34 and @entity1 finished by singing ‘ @entity313 ’ from the @entity13 movie @entity314 @entity1 will certainly struggle to provide the softly cynical insights and streetwise quips about the workings of celebrity and showbusiness that the likes of @entity156 , @entity70 and their successors @entity208 and @entity322 rely on in their interviews			1
it was hard to believe that @entity4 were going to respond well to the persona of a modest , apologetic @entity167 that @entity1 has presented			2
@entity4 likes its stars to be special not ordinary			0
@entity1 ’s approach has been that of the bumbling , stunned ‘ civilian ’ who ca n’t believe his luck or done anything to earn his ‘ @entity53			0
’ @entity4 audiences are too sophisticated not to see through the mock humility when he says ‘ it ’s almost too much for my tiny brain to take in ’ or ‘ i ’m talking as if i have any authority on this			0
i know nothing ! ’ a much better balance came in @entity1 ’s anecdote about becoming annoyed that a photographer was taking pictures of him dining , only to find they were of @entity35 , who was eating in the same restaurant			1
the way that @entity1 and @entity34 dressed up and parodied the star ’s most famous movies gave @entity1 his chance to do what he does best : ham it up and endearingly play the fool , not least when he put a wig on to be @entity353 from sleepless in @entity355			1
they finished by singing ‘ @entity313 ’ from @entity314			0
the grand finale saw @entity1 take to a grand piano to sing a song about his first night in the @entity4 limelight			0
no one could say he did n’t give it his all			0
@entity1 's version of the @entity5 sticks faithfully to the formula of a house band , smooth comic monologue , and sketches			1

@entity1 makes his debut as the host of the @entity5
taking over from @entity373 @entity166 , whose reign lasted ten years
@entity35 and @entity34 were the @entity117 comedian 's first guests
the 36 - year - old father - of - two has never presented a chat show before
his first stint presenting the *iconic* show ' must go down as a success '
