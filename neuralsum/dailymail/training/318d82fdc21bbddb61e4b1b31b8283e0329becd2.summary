by @entity0 published : 18:08 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 20:48 est , 26 march 2013 countless lives will be endangered by the government ’s ‘ misguided ’ privatisation of land and sea rescue service , critics warned tuesday			1
stranded mountain climbers and sailors on stricken ships will be put at risk by the decision to hand search and rescue ( @entity14 ) operations to a @entity17 company , it was claimed			1
a £ 1.6billion deal , confirmed yesterday , saw ministers wrench responsibility from the @entity22 and @entity21 after 70 years , in favour of @entity25 - based @entity24			1
at risk : rescue helicopter services such as those flown by @entity29 , will now be operated by a private @entity17 company the government pushed ahead with the sale despite objections from @entity29 , a flight lieutenant who commands a @entity14 crew at @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37			1
as ministers announced the plans , the prince was believed to have been at the controls of an @entity22 helicopter that rescued a family stranded by wintry weather on a @entity46 hillside			1
a family of five , including a 16 - month - old baby , were cut off by 10ft snowdrifts and had been forced to burn furniture to keep warm after a power cut			0
they believe the @entity53 , known as flight lieutenant @entity46 when on duty , was flying the @entity56 that plucked them to safety			0
one of those rescued , @entity59 , 22 , a shopworker from @entity60 , near @entity61 , said : ‘ i ’m grateful to the @entity22 , they did a brilliant job			2
’ he said of the privatisation : ‘ if it ai n’t bust , do n’t fix it			0
’ mercy mission : prince @entity29 leaves a @entity56 , which will be replaced as part of the plans @entity24 will also take over civilian @entity14 bases run by the @entity72 ( @entity72 )			2
until 2007 , @entity24 had run rescue missions for the @entity72 for 24 years			1
but concerns have been raised because @entity24 is axing two of the 12 sar bases and reducing the total helicopter fleet from 24 to 22			2
the deal also spells the end for the distinctive yellow @entity56 helicopters , in favour of @entity83 and @entity84 aircraft			2
the @entity85 said that under the new regime rescuers will reach emergencies more swiftly and could cover larger areas of the country			0
but defence analyst @entity91 said privatising such services ‘ brings a lot of dangers ’ , adding : ' going to a @entity93 , which this essentially is , brings a lot of dangers			2
' callouts have gone up 40 per cent since 2005 , this is a big operation , a lot of people 's lives are at risk here			0
' will the private sector operation take on the same sort of risks that the @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity72 do , on the same scale ? i rather doubt they will			1
' @entity24 , the @entity25 firm that won the contract , will use the @entity83 helicopter , which it already uses to transport offshore oil workers in the @entity115 @entity116 , @entity117 defence spokesman , said : ‘ the privatisation of military helicopter search and rescue services is misguided			1
it will end the role of military air crew in these life - saving flights , which is a bad move			0
‘ the public has come to trust and value the military search and rescue service and this privatisation is wrong			1
’ the lucrative ten - year contract , starting in 2015 , will be managed by the @entity72			0
all bases will operate 24 hours a day			0
transport secretary @entity129 said : ‘ our @entity14 helicopter service plays a crucial role			0
‘ the public can have great confidence in @entity24 and its ability to deliver a first - class service			1
’ military personnel involved in @entity14 will be able to apply to leave the service and take a job with the private contractor			0
the changes are not expected to directly impact the @entity53 who is due to finish as a @entity14 pilot later this spring .			0

@entity17 private firm @entity24 will take over helicopter rescue service
