the gcse brand could be scrapped altogether in 2016 to make a clean break with a system first introduced in 1988			2
a single exam board will preside over each subject , bringing an end to competition which mr @entity1 said had encouraged a ‘ corrupt effort to massage up pass rates ’			1
announcing the reforms in the @entity46 , he said : ‘ it is time for the race to the bottom to end			2
it is time to tackle grade inflation and dumbing down			2
it is time to raise aspirations			0
’ ‘ after years of drift , decline and dumbing down , at last we are reforming our examination system to compete with the world ’s best			0
’ the aim of mr @entity1 ’s reforms is to restore o - level - style rigour in a bid to halt the nation ’s slide down the international schools league tables			1
however his ambition to fully replicate the o - level system , in which only the brightest sat the toughest exam , has been shelved following opposition from @entity73			1
the deputy prime minister ’s intervention also delayed the reforms by a year , raising fears @entity78 could try to save gcses if the party wins the next election			0
but education sources last night said the reforms were ‘ unstoppable ’			0

they said : ‘ together we can overcome those forces that have held our children back – the entrenched establishment voices who have become the enemies of promise			0
’ the proposals will see hundreds of thousands of 11 - year - olds , who started secondary school this term , becoming the new ‘ guinea pigs ’ of the education system			1
exam boards have previously been accused of ‘ dumbing down ’ gcses to attract the multi-million pound business from secondary schools			0
but under the reforms , just one will be selected by @entity121 to offer qualifications in each subject in a bid to prevent the ‘ race to the bottom ’			0
@entity127 , a schools minister until this month 's reshuffle , insisted the plans could n't be reversed even if @entity78 won the next general election gcses in other subjects are also being toughened up and are unlikely to keep the ‘ gcse ’ title			0
currently , many gcses have two tiers so pupils can either be entered for the foundation level – the simpler of the two and the maximum grade achievable is a c – or the higher level , where students can get up to an a *			1
under the shake - up , the foundation and higher level will be scrapped in the @entity12 subjects , meaning there will be no cap on how well pupils can achieve			1

teaching unions also condemned the change			0
@entity183 , of the @entity184 , said : ‘ o - levels were abolished 25 years ago for a very good reason : they just tested memory and essay writing , which are not crucial skills for the majority of jobs or life today			2
’ but business welcomed the move			0
@entity195 , director general of the @entity196 , said : ‘ business leaders want a stronger curriculum and more rigorous exams			2
these measures are welcome progress towards delivering that			0
