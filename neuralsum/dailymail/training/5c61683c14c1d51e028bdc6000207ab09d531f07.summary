by @entity0 it was once a gritty stretch of @entity2 known for rail yards , warehouses and aging industrial buildings , so desolate it was dubbed ' @entity7 '			2
now , one of the @entity10 's biggest construction projects is transforming a stretch of @entity2 's west side with 20 new buildings - 17 of them high - rises - so tightly packed that it has earned the nickname : ' @entity17 on the @entity18			1
' when finished in 2024 , the @entity20 area will boast more hotels , as well as an observation deck higher than the @entity23			1
this development and the adjacent $ 4.5bn @entity44 complex comprise the city 's most ambitious private real estate ventures since @entity47 went up in the 1930s			1
when fully completed , the two projects will offer more than 22 million square feet of space , including 6,000 residential units - more footage than the rebuilt @entity53 in lower @entity2			2
construction on @entity44 's first 65 - storey office tower will start after the platform is finished by year 's end			2
how it will look : the planned @entity44 development project on the west side of @entity2 development project : a huge crane by rail tracks used by commuter trains at @entity65 in @entity35 the plan for @entity20 , occupying an area between 30th and 34th streets bordered by @entity69 and the @entity70 , features 16 buildings - 14 of them skyscrapers			1

work also has begun on @entity20 ' tallest building - an 80 - storey skyscraper with an observation deck higher than the @entity23			1
it will be home to the corporate headquarters of @entity88 by 2019			0
the @entity20 project site shows ongoing construction of skyscrapers @entity44 fills the block between @entity93 and @entity95 avenues with three towers - two more than 60 storeys - a public plaza and walkway , shops , garages and a hotel			1

the 16 - storey building is to undergo a $ 200m renovation with glass floor - to - ceiling exteriors by 2016			0
@entity111 urban planner @entity110 says the developments accelerate a shift of the city 's high - end commercial heart away from the traditional stronghold of @entity2 surrounding @entity47			1
