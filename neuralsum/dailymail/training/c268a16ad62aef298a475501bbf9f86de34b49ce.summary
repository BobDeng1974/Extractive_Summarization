by @entity0 last updated at 2:51 pm on 30th august 2011 @entity1 : the conditions of @entity4 waters are ideal for @entity6 sharks @entity4 waters are an ideal hunting ground for great white sharks , who are already ' occasional vagrant visitors ' , claims a shark expert			1
president of the @entity12 said that it is only a matter of time until his theory that the predators visit @entity4 shores is verified			1
mr @entity19 believes he almost proved the presence of a great white in the @entity4 with a photograph of a shark caught off the north - east coast of @entity25			1
he said : ' i sent the photo to some of the world 's leading experts but as soon as they heard it was caught off @entity25 they started looking at what else it could be			1
' ' the real surprise is that we do n't have an established white shark population , because the conditions here mirror those in parts of @entity40 , @entity41 and northern @entity42			1
' the normal range of water temperature for great whites is between @entity46 and @entity47 which fits with @entity4 water in the summer			1
' the shark expert has investigated more than 80 reported sightings of great whites in @entity4 waters over the last 14 years but only seven were found to be credible			1
fishermen in @entity55 have reported great whites sticking their heads out of the water , known as ' spy - hopping ' , and fishermen on three different boats described a sighting of a great white within three weeks of one another			2
mr @entity19 said : ' the reason the evidence is so compelling is that it 's from independent witnesses who do not know each other on different boats			1
' the problem is these things happen in a flash			2
unless the shark jumps right out of the water or is caught , all we 'll see is a dorsal fin sticking out the water			2
' the closest capture of a great white was off @entity80 ( in western @entity81 ) about 200 nautical miles from @entity4 shores which is no distance to them			2
' there have been sightings of other sharks in @entity4 waters over the summer			2
earlier this month fisherman @entity89 spotted a 15ft thresher shark off @entity91 in @entity92 , where they are very rarely seen			2
another fisherman caught a 21 stone porbeagle shark off the coast of @entity97 , @entity98 , last month			2
there have also been two separate sightings of what was believed to have been an oceanic whitetip shark , a species also known to attack humans , in @entity105 , @entity55 , in june			0
mr @entity19 believes it is only a matter of time before proof is found that the species at the top of the marine food chain , the great white shark - carcharodon carcharias - is occasionally present in @entity4 waters			1
he said : ' great whites are highly nomadic in movement around the @entity114 so it 's reasonable to say there 's a good chance they may stray into @entity4 waters			0
expert : but @entity19 's theory is not universally accepted by scientists ' i do suspect we do get the occasional vagrant visitor			1
' global warming may have driven the sharks ' prey further north , added mr @entity19 , which could further entice the great white to @entity4 shores			1
he said : ' the water temperatures around @entity4 are well within the great white 's tolerance range			0
so in theory there 's no reason they should n't be here already without global warming			0
' but what may be happening is that it may affect the distribution of shark 's prey - meaning they may follow that			0
' however dr @entity146 , co-ordinator of the @entity148 project and a senior marine scientist at the @entity150 in @entity151 , said the odds of a great white being found in @entity4 waters were extremely low as the creatures are very rare in the northeast @entity114			0
the @entity148 survey team has spent more than 5,000 hours scanning the seas off southwest @entity158 in the past five years but the only predatory sharks seen have been single blues and threshers			0
@entity162 : a map showing the global distribution of the @entity6 ' the only large shark the public are likely to see is the harmless plankton - feeding basking shark , which can grow to over 10m long and is occasionally seen leaping out of the water , ' he said			0
but dr @entity146 accepted there was a small chance of a great white sighting off the @entity4 coast			0
' it 's certainly not impossible that a great white could be seen or caught in @entity4 waters one day , as we know they occur off southwest @entity180 in very low numbers			0
' spotted : in recent months both thresher ( left ) and porbeagle sharks have been seen around the @entity184 but despite the recent sightings , the opportunity of seeing sharks is decreasing year on year			0
a study by @entity189 in @entity190 , @entity191 , concluded that the @entity114 shark population had declined by more than 50 per cent between 1986 and 2000 due to overfishing			0
mr @entity19 said : ' unless we do something about shark mortality in the @entity114 we wo n't be having this conversation in 50 years time			1
' the @entity6 : an expert claims these predators will soon be spotted in @entity4 waters			0

@entity12 president @entity19 : ' conditions here mirror those in parts of @entity40 , @entity41 and northern @entity42 '
