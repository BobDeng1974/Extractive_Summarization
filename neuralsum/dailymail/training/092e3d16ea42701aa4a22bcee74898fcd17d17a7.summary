the kitchen sink in the flat that suffered the direct hit is filled with the usual pots and pans , sitting in a masses of broken crockery and chunks of plaster that was blown over			2
an upside down kettle lies beneath what looks like a broken part of a kitchen cupboard			2
a fridge lies overturned on its side , covered in rubble			2
