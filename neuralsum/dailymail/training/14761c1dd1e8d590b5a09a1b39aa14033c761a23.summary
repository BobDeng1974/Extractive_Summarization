by @entity0 a 57 - year - old @entity2 woman who visited her doctor complaining of facial pain was found to have a dental implant in her left sinus			1
two years earlier , she 'd had the dental implant – a 2cm long metal screw which is used to hold a false tooth in place - inserted into her upper jaw			1
but a ct scan revealed it had migrated to her sinuses			1
a 57 - year - old woman who visited her doctor with recurrent inflammation of the sinuses and facial pain was found to have a dental implant in her left sinus ( pictured ) at the time , there were no complications but when the woman ’s sinus problems were investigated , the implant was found to be missing from her jaw			1
doctors also discovered that her gum had healed over and there was no sign of the implant			0
it was eventually tracked down in her sinus – a cavity beside the eye - and removed during surgery			2
following the surgery , the 57 - year - old patient found that her symptoms improved rapidly			2
she attended a check - up eight months later and still had no symptoms			0
further tests also showed that her sinus had returned to normal and no lasting damage had been done			2
surgeons used a camera to track down the screw in her sinus ( pictured ) and then removed it			2
once it has been removed , her symptoms rapidly disappeared it is thought the problem may have occurred as a result of the implant being improperly positioned in her jaw			1
study researcher @entity53 , of the @entity54 in @entity2 , told @entity55 that he believes the implant was probably in the woman 's sinus for at least a year , and perhaps even since the surgery two years earlier			1
he added that other cases of dental implants ending up in the sinus have been reported			0
the 2cm metal implant ( pictured ) was implanted into the woman 's upper jaw two years before it was found in her sinus			1
these implants are usually used to stabilise a bridge or false tooth @entity69 , a consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at @entity71 , told @entity72 : ‘ when the implant is inserted , if it does n’t fully integrate , it can migrate either to the surface or to a sinus as it is treated as a foreign body			0
‘ if it does n’t fully integrate then the body sees it as a foreign object and dispels it			0
usually it would dispel it into the mouth			0
’ he went on to explain that the implant would only have been able to migrate if it was not attached to a bridge or false tooth and that this is rare			0
the case was reported in @entity88 .			0

the woman , 57 , went to a doctor in @entity2 with pain and sinus inflammation
a ct scan showed she had a metal screw in her left sinus , near her eye
it had been implanted into her upper jaw two years earlier
surgeons removed the implant from her sinus and her symptoms disappeared
