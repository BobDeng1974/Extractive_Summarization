this transparency includes allowing @entity88 inspectors access to all previously disputed facilities and the providing of all previously requested information about their operation			0
' these are substantial limitations which will help prevent @entity0 from building a nuclear weapon , ' said the president			1
some sanctions will be eased : the deal allows for the relaxing of some sanctions , but only if @entity0 continues to abide by the agreement major progress : president @entity15 speaks saturday in the @entity100 at the @entity22 there will be a multi-step verification process to ensure @entity0 complies with the agreement			1
@entity0 agreed to these steps in exchange for a moderate relief from economic sanctions that have significantly derailed the country 's economy over the past several years			1
' the @entity34 and our friends and allies have agreed to provide @entity0 modest relief , while continuing to apply our toughest sanctions , ' president @entity15 added			1
the relief includes suspending embargoes against gold and precious medals , @entity0 's auto industry and petrochemical exports , which @entity34 officials said will give the country about $ 1.5billion in revenue			0

iranmust prove itself : @entity34 secretary of state @entity43 gestures as he speaks to the media about the deal that has been reached celebration : ( l to @entity56 ) @entity143 foreign policy chief @entity142 , @entity55 foreign minister @entity54 , @entity145 foreign minister @entity144 , @entity0 foreign minister @entity146 and @entity53 foreign minister @entity52 an amazing announcement : @entity0 foreign minister @entity146 ( @entity141 ) reacts next to @entity143 foreign policy chief @entity142 ( c ) as @entity34 secretary of state @entity43 ( 2nd @entity148 ) embraces @entity55 foreign minister @entity54 the president added that this development is proof that diplomacy can work , and that the @entity34 is committed to this course of action			1
speaking from @entity50 , @entity34 secretary of state @entity43 said the deal is ' only the first step , ' but ' a critical first step			1
' he also called the deal ' fail safe ' and said that the president took great risks in coming to the agreement			0
both the president and mr @entity43 were quick to note that no one will take @entity0 's words at face value and that the deal alone is just the beginning , the onus is now on the country to follow up			1
' this would provide @entity0 with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with the wider world based on mutual respect , ' mr @entity15 said			1
' but if @entity0 refuses , it will face growing pressure and isolation			0
' the world 's most powerful countries brought their biggest diplomatic guns , with mr @entity43 flying in saturday as it looked like an agreement was increasingly likely			2
let 's make a deal : @entity34 secretary of state @entity43 ( r ) shakes hands with @entity0 foreign minister @entity146 after the announcement all smiles : @entity0 foreign minister @entity146 ( @entity141 ) and @entity55 foreign minister @entity54 ( r ) enjoy the moment the country has reportedly agreed to stop enriching uranium for the next six months while the details of a more permanent agreement are hammered out			1
mr @entity43 joined the foreign ministers of @entity192 , @entity53 , @entity193 , @entity55 and @entity145 in @entity50 , @entity194 , and his inclusion was seen as a sign a deal was imminent			1
@entity198 , @entity0 's newly - elected moderate president , had previously spoke of hoping to bring to an end the @entity201 sanctions that have crippled his country 's economy the agreement is a ' first - step ' deal , according to @entity206			1
it is binding for six months , but officials are hopeful that economic incentives will entice the previously until the announcement , which came early sunday morning @entity50 time , it was unclear whether the current round of negotiations would produce even a tentative agreement			0
@entity193 's foreign secretary @entity216 spoke previously of ' very difficult negotiations , ' saying ' narrow gaps ' remain on the same issues that blocked agreement at the last round earlier this month			1
' we 're not here because things are necessarily finished , ' @entity216 told reporters			0
' we 're here because they 're difficult , and they remain difficult			0
' @entity43 and his counterparts from @entity53 , @entity193 , @entity55 , @entity192 and @entity145 headed for @entity50 after diplomats said friday that @entity0 foreign minister @entity146 and top @entity143 diplomat @entity142 had made progress on a key sticking point - @entity0 's claim to a right to produce nuclear fuel through uranium enrichment			1
a sense of relief : @entity143 foreign policy chief @entity142 ( 2nd @entity141 ) is embraced by @entity34 secretary of state @entity43 news of the agreement was immediately followed by reports that the @entity34 and @entity0 held secret talks regarding the country 's nuclear program since mr @entity198 was elected president in june			1
the secret meetings were held in @entity247 and other secret locations and kept secret from all @entity34 allies , including @entity251			0
the talks were held in @entity247 after @entity253 volunteered to mediate between the two nations , who have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1979			0
several talks were held prior to august , but little progress was made before then			0
the early meetings have been characterized as exploratory and mainly to see if there was a basis for negotiation			0
details were not previously released but it appeared the two sides were trying to reconcile @entity0 's insistence that it has a right to enrich for peaceful purposes while assuaging fears that @entity7 was secretly trying to build a bomb , a charge the @entity0 deny			0
as the talks entered an intensive phase , @entity274 spokesman @entity273 said the negotiations had reached ' the final moment , ' according to @entity192 's @entity279			0
@entity55 foreign minister @entity54 told reporters he wanted ' a deal - but a solid deal - and i am here to work toward that end			2
' @entity55 's concern that the negotiators were rushing into a flawed deal with @entity0 helped delay an agreement during a session nearly two weeks ago			1
other obstacles include @entity0 's plutonium reactor under construction in @entity77 as well as a formula for providing limited sanctions relief without weakening international leverage against @entity0			1
@entity43 met with @entity53 foreign minister @entity52 as part of the negotiations @entity45 appeared to allude to the toughening of demands after @entity55 's intervention			1
@entity0 's @entity303 news agency quoted him as saying that back then , ' the two sides had agreement on issues but now it has reached a stage that there are various viewpoints and it is somehow difficult			0
' enrichment is a hot - button issue because it can be used both to make reactor fuel and to make nuclear weapons			0
@entity0 argues it is enriching only for power , and scientific and medical purposes , and says it has no interest in nuclear arms			1
@entity318 and its allies point to @entity7 's earlier efforts to hide enrichment and allege it worked on developing such weapons			0
@entity0 has insisted on that right throughout almost a decade of mostly fruitless negotiations			0
but @entity45 last weekend indicated that @entity0 is ready to sign a deal that does not expressly state that claim			2
@entity0 hard - liners have been suspicious of talk of nuclear compromise since moderate president @entity198 took office in september , fearing his team will give not get enough in terms of sanctions relief over the six - months of any first - stage agreement			1
@entity43 was greeted by ambassador @entity335 of the @entity336 in @entity50 ( 2 - r ) , ambassador @entity337 of the @entity194 @entity338 ( 2 - l ) , and @entity34 @entity339 ( @entity141 ) several @entity34 senators - both @entity341 and @entity343 - previously voiced displeasure with the parameters of the potential agreement , arguing that the @entity34 and its partners are offering too much for something short of a full freeze on uranium enrichment			2
on wednesday , @entity0 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity350 , said his country would never compromise on ' red lines			0
' since then @entity7 had even publicly reverted to its original stance - that the six powers must recognize uranium enrichment as @entity0 's right , despite strong opposition by @entity251 and within the @entity358			2
still , comments from @entity0 officials in @entity50 indicated that reverting to tough talk on enrichment may have at least partially been meant for home consumption			0
in @entity50 , a senior @entity0 negotiator said the @entity0 claim to the right to enrich did not need to be explicitly recognized in any initial deal , despite @entity350 's comment , adding that the supreme leader was not planning to intervene in the talks			0
he did suggest , however , that language on that point remained difficult and that there were other differences .			0

@entity0 has agreed to stop enriching uranium above five per cent for six months in exchange for limited *lifting* of sanctions
other *concessions* include neutralizing stockpiles of near 20 per cent uranium , *destroying* several centrifuges and not installing new ones beyond those necessary for nuclear power
secretary of state @entity43 joined the foreign ministers of @entity192 , @entity53 , @entity193 , @entity55 and @entity145 at negotiating table saturday
president @entity15 called it ' the most significant and tangible progress ' since he took office
