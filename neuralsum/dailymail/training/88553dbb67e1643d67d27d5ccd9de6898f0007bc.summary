by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:08 est , 15 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:08 est , 15 february 2014 parents struggling with the spiralling cost of private education are signing deals which give @entity9 ’s leading public schools a share of the family home in return for deferring fee payments			1
the @entity14 can reveal that parents are so desperate to keep their children in top schools , they allow them to take a ‘ charge ’ on the house as a guarantee against unpaid fees			1
it means the school allows the child to remain in education but claims the fees when the family ’s house is eventually sold			1
@entity28 in @entity29 , which charges up to £ 30,385 a year , is one school taking a ' charge ' out of parents ' properties in order to cover fee payments in extreme circumstances , the school could force the sale of the house to recover the debt			1
the headmaster of a leading @entity41 day - school , who did not want to be named , told @entity14 that taking charges on homes had become common practice			2
schools including @entity28 in @entity29 , whose former pupils include @entity48 and model @entity50 , @entity51 , where @entity53 playwright @entity52 and children ’s author @entity54 were educated , and @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , have all agreed deals to take charges over parents ’ properties			1
@entity28 charges up to £ 30,385 a year , @entity63 ’s up to £ 32,235 and @entity56 up to £ 24,420			1
@entity28 has at least one charge over a @entity66 property which is currently for sale at £ 1.3 million			1
bursar @entity68 said : ‘ we understand that school fees are a major financial commitment for parents and that financial situations can change			2
taking a charge on homes is the last resort			0
’ he added that there were no recorded cases in the past five years of the school forcing the sale of a house to recover an unpaid debt			2
@entity84 , a governor at the school , said : ‘ public schools do take out legal charges on occasions but this is only done when parents are in real difficulty			1
‘ it allows the parents to pay the fees later while the school can be content that the parents ca n’t disappear without paying			2
’ @entity93 , bursar at @entity51 , confirmed that the school held charges over several properties			1
at @entity56 , a floating charge against parents ’ property has been enshrined as part of its ‘ affordability packages ’ offered to help parents pay the fees			1
the @entity51 , @entity104 , which charges up to £ 32,235 a year , is also accepting charges			2
they allow the school to take part of the value of a house when it is sold school governor @entity110 said : ‘ we have had this system in place for four or five years and i would say it has been successful			0
we only have a handful of legal charges against property – probably about four or five			0
‘ it all started when a couple of parents got into hardship when the recession hit and we felt it was important to be as fair and flexible as possible			0
‘ we only take out legal charges if the loan is more of a long - term agreement that requires more security , as we give some parents the option to take eight years to pay back the fees			0
‘ it is usually the whole fees amount that parents borrow			0
‘ the middle class have been squeezed over the past five years and i would say that all independent schools are having to look at ways to make it easier for parents to pay the fees			0
‘ i think we have to use all the weapons in our armoury to make paying the fees as flexible as possible for parents who have come to us with problems			0
’ @entity141 , general secretary of the @entity142 , said that it was not known how widespread the practice had become			0
‘ at a time of recession parents will struggle more to pay their fees , so it is only logical to estimate this is happening more often , ’ he said			0
since 2000 , private school fees have more than doubled , with pupil numbers dropping from 514,531 in 2009 to 508,472 in 2012 .			0

private schools are placing ' charges ' on parents homes
charge allows the school to take a portion of sale value to cover fees
in extreme cases schools can force parents to sell the family home
@entity28 , @entity29 , @entity169 , @entity51 , and @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , have all agreed deals with parents
