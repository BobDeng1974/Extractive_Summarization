by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 20 march 2013 this giant chewing gum masterpiece took 4,000 pieces of chewing gum and three months to make			1
with patience and painstaking precision @entity5 artist @entity4 built the complex geometrical structure , which stood at almost two metres and was nearly three metres long			1
the sticks were stacked , piled and assembled with care , but @entity4 deliberately melted a few so that the towers would eventually fall down			2
@entity14 metropolis : the chewing gum sculpture took almost three months to build art in progress : @entity5 artist @entity4 from @entity19 undertook the painstaking work , inspired by house of cards constructions , as something to entertain his art class @entity4 , from @entity19 , explained that he wanted the towers to begin disintegrating , despite all his months of hard work			1
' it represents a sculpture of frustration and that 's why i chose to knock it down by melting a few crucial pieces			0
' after melting a few sticks , the work fell down and collapsed slowly			0
' the 34 - year - old said that it started as a way to interest his art class : ' i was invited to teach a room full of art students and i had to find something that would occupy so many people			0
' i was inspired by the system of matchitecture , where thousands of matches are used to create a sculpture			0
' i 've always been fascinated by the construction of a house of cards and decided to create a sculpture with a material that has n't been used before			0
' spectacular sculpture : the chewing gum artwork started off held together by saliva , but eventually needed glue to help it stay upright as a contemporary artist , @entity4 was looking for an original material that would prove to be challenging to work with			1
he added : ' i wanted to use something that was challenging and the characteristics of chewing gum seemed perfect			2
' chewing gum is unstable and i thought that it would be tough to create a huge sculpture out of this material			1
' the scaffolding - like structures were made into fragile twisting towers and @entity4 artist had to adapt his methods to make sure the sculpture could start off properly upright			2
he said : ' i tried to complete the design by just using saliva , but that was n't strong enough , so i had to use glue to make it secure			0
' inspiration : @entity4 used the principle of geometrical stacking as his starting point all in the detail : the chewing gum sticks were delicately balanced and stacked to make the structure strong enough to stand up elaborate : the complex work of art stood at almost two metres and nearly three metres long ' then , the sculpture was constructed much like a house of cards			1
' the sculptures had a strong resemblance to a city skyline - but @entity4 did not have a particular place in mind			0
he added : ' inevitably , the sculpture makes people think of a city because of the geometrical construction			0
' @entity4 bought the gum from a @entity5 supermarket , before @entity95 stepped in to supply him with the rest			2
falling down : @entity4 melted a few chewing gum pieces so that the city skyline would gradually crumble to the ground deliberate disintegration : @entity4 wanted the skyline to collapse slowly the end : the city towers ended up totally disintegrating , replicating a town that had turned to rubble			1

chewing gum sculpture took almost three months to build and 4,000 sticks of gum
artist @entity4 said he chose the chewing gum as a challenge , *knowing* the structure would be ' unstable '
@entity4 started off trying to just use his saliva , but in the end had to resort to glue to hold it all upright
