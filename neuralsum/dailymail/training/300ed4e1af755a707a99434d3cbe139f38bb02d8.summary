blood oozed from the cut beneath his right eye			2
the wound was so deep that the bright red claret streamed down his protruding right cheek			2
as @entity10 lay sprawled on the touchline receiving treatment after a blow from @entity14 , his leg twitched impatiently , eager to return to the battle as if a few wires had been short - circuited on impact			2
perhaps the most surprising thing when the blood had been wiped away was that raw pink flesh lay beneath the split skin , that it had not uncovered the glinting metal interior of a robot , programmed and primed for combat			0
against @entity35 – against all opponents at this @entity31 – @entity10 's six - foot frame stalked about the pitch mechanically , eyes squinted , trained on his next target ; a goal to aim at , an opponent to tackle , a ball to intercept			1
yet once that final whistle blows in a match , @entity10 is transformed			0
he was the first to console opponents in their defeat throughout the @entity31			1
when the @entity62 crushed @entity63 in their first game he embraced @entity65			1
when they knocked out @entity67 and @entity68 in the later stages he shared a hug with @entity71 and @entity72			0
in the aftermath of the final , late into sunday night , he lay an arm around the shoulders of an exhausted @entity77			0
his off - field persona is surely why he is such an influence , an inspiration , to his team - mates on it			2
in 2011 team - mate @entity83 scored a 25 - minute hat - trick in a @entity86 win against @entity87 , but in testament to the effect @entity10 has on the team his biggest concern post-match was that the central midfielder had gone off with a broken collar bone			1
he may not quite be indestructible , but his absence noticeably shook the team			0
@entity83 said afterwards : ' @entity10 is our midfield motor			2
he dictates the tempo of the game and you could see that we lost our rhythm without him			0
' @entity26 manager @entity44 calls him ' the brain , ' while others have referred to him as the heart and the pulse			1
the chosen one : @entity10 's signature boots that he wore for the @entity106 vintage : the shinpads worn by @entity10 at the @entity31 watching on : @entity10 's girlfriend @entity109 in the stands at the @entity111 overcome : @entity114 team - mates @entity112 and @entity10 have now won it all together all smiles : schweinsteiger celebrating with team - mate @entity117 sealed with a kiss : holding the @entity31 trophy that everybody dreams about @entity121 : posing at the @entity111 ahead of his team - mates @entity124 : a medal - laden @entity10 celebrates with the @entity26 fans but @entity10 was anything but the life - blood of a team until his mid- 20s			1
he was a drifter , looking for the right fit but failing to find it			0
@entity132 is credited as developing the 29 - year - old into a world class central midfielder during his two - year spell at @entity114 from 2009			2
up until then , @entity10 was primarily a winger on the right or left , having played full - back as a youngster , and was used as a utility player			1
but @entity132 had @entity141 and @entity142 to play on either flank and spotted traits in him of a powerful force in the middle of the park ; strong , not afraid to get stuck in , good in the air , an eye for a pass , with potential for the spectacular at any moment			0
it is no wonder that reports have emerged that @entity132 is keen on bringing him to @entity156			0
there are hints of @entity159 about @entity10 in that he has played his entire career at one club and is the nucleus in the centre of midfield , so whether or not he could be prised away from the @entity166 club heading into his 30s is another matter			1
leading the festivities : schweinsteiger at the post-match celebrations party time : schweinsteiger with gilrfriend @entity109 @entity174 : @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity10 enjoying themselves nice touch : but he finds the time to put a consoling arm around beaten finalist @entity77 but there is n't much more he could win there			1
people hail @entity77 's @entity187 record but @entity10 is not far off			0
he has seven @entity166 titles , seven @entity62 cups , two @entity190 and a @entity86 trophy			1
he has been runner up in the ultimate @entity194 club tournament twice			0
one of those finals proved he is only human after all			0
in the 2012 @entity86 final against @entity199 , with the score tied at 3 - 3 in the shootout , he missed the penalty which allowed @entity201 to step up to seal the victory			1
there was shock in @entity26 afterwards when he appeared to refuse to shake the hand of their president @entity206 in the post-match medal ceremony			1
@entity10 insisted it was not an intentional snub , saying : ' after this great disappointment , i noticed nothing around me			0
' the player is wired to win – he struggles to compute what happens when he does n't .			2

schweinsteiger *superb* in midfield as @entity26 win the @entity31
*germans* beat @entity35 1 - 0 in extra time to lift the trophy for the *fourth* time
he was the first to console his beaten opponents following full time
adds @entity31 triumph to seven @entity166 titles , seven @entity62 cups , two @entity190 and a @entity86
