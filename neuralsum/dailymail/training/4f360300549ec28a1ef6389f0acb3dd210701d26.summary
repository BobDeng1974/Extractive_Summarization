by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has a knack for raising eyebrows			1
despite years of outspoken columns in national newspapers , the writer still now never fails to drop a new tit - bit of information that leaves jaws hanging open - most recently the fact that she was into bondage as a teen			1
she has admitted this today in her latest job role as an @entity16 for the revamped loaded magazine , after receiving a letter from a man whose wife - hot under the collar from the new @entity22 film trailer - is demanding they get kinky in the bedroom			1
she said : ' to be perfectly frank , i was into this sort of palaver in a @entity40 way when i was a girl			2
' i was just 17 when i knocked on the door of one of @entity44 ’s most notorious sadists and suggested that he show me what it was all about			2
' my interest in being thrashed lasted into my 30s , whereupon i developed a sense of humour and suddenly could n’t so much as look at a pair of nipple clamps without howling with laughter			1
' she continues : 's & @entity58 , like love - bites and @entity57 , can look lovely on the young and pretty			2
but there ’s few things funnier than a fat middle - aged fetishist			0
' @entity29 then goes on to advise her new pen pal , who is extremely reluctant to get involved in extreme bedrooms antics , to play his wife at her own game by wholeheartedly taking to bondage in one session in an attempt to put her off for life			1
she said : ' there ’s a theory that the reason women are throwing their collective undercrackers at @entity22 is because , in an age of perceived male non-commitment , he is obsessed with @entity78			0
' women are big on being seen as ‘ special ’ and ‘ unique ’ and all that crap , so it ’s not hard to imagine that this is the real appeal – not the fluffy handcuffs and silky bonds			0
@entity85 pictured with her novel @entity22 , which has now been made into a @entity87 movie ' your best bet is to go the whole hog with the aim of putting her off completely			0
' @entity101 out the silk and fluff and bring in the hardware - stick a ball - gag in her mouth , chain her to a chair and beat her intensely for a full five minutes			0
the september issue of @entity103 is out now ' then release her and ask innocently , ' was i doing it hard enough ? ” ' chances are , if she ’s just a masochist manque , she ’ll be desperate to return to vanilla sex with maybe just a tiny bit of swearing on the side			0
' deputy editor of loaded magazine , @entity114 said of their decision to hire @entity29 as an agony aunt : ' there are n't many brave enough to admit they were thrashed about during bondage sessions well into their 30s			1
' that 's one of the many reasons why @entity2 is so brilliant			1
' when loaded first started , @entity126 was the mag 's opinionated feminist ' now , for the relaunch of @entity103 , we 've appointed @entity29 as our resident agony aunt , a huge coup			0
' in the mag 's current issue , as well as bondage , @entity29 also gives her opinion on infidelity , prostitution and global warming			2
' the september issue of the newly revamped @entity103 , featuring interviews with @entity142 and @entity143 , is out now .			0
