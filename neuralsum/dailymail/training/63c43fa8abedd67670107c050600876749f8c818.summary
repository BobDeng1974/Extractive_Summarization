by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 was one of two notable absentees from practice at @entity5 before the fifth @entity6 between @entity7 and @entity8			1
it was thought @entity2 , perhaps wearing a protective mask of some description on the nose which was broken by a @entity14 bouncer in @entity7 's win at @entity16 last week , would be present and correct at nets			2
instead , like @entity8 captain @entity18 when @entity8 held their voluntary practice a few hours earlier , @entity2 was the only member of his team missing on wednesday afternoon			2
@entity2 was at the ground but took no part in training			0
his inaction , according to @entity7 , was ' planned ' and will not impact on his availability when the hosts set out on friday to defend a 2 - 1 lead in the last match of the series			0
it was reported after the victory in @entity48 , where the fast bowler was man of the match , that - despite stitches in his nose - he was expecting to be fit for purpose at @entity5			0
recovery : @entity7 hope that @entity2 will have recovered before the fifth test , which takes place at @entity5 rest : there were rumours @entity18 had gone to the zoo but the official reason for him missing training was rest			1

@entity2 missed training *due* to injury
@entity18 also missed training , but *apparently* he was just resting
@entity7 and @entity8 meet in the fifth test at @entity5 on friday
