by @entity0 a colour blind artist claims he can now ' hear ' colours after having an ' eyeborg ' antenna implanted into his skull			1
@entity7 , 31 , has been wearing an external electronic eye for 10 years which picks up colour frequencies through a camera and transforms them into sound vibrations			1
mr @entity7 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , was born with achromatopsia , a rare condition which means he can only see in black and white			1
but he has now convinced surgeons to implant the chip inside his skull so that he can perceive more intricate colours			1
@entity7 who has the world 's first cyborg antenna - or ' eyeborg '			1
it is composed of a camera on one end and an audio input on the other end the audio input - which is now implanted inside the back of his skull - allows him to receive the visual spectrum captured by his camera via bone vibrations a wifi connector inside the chip allows him to hear images sent from a mobile phone - without even looking at them			1
the cyborg antenna - or ' eyeborg ' - is composed of a camera on one end and an audio input on the other end			0
the audio input - which is now implanted inside the back of his skull - allows him to receive the visual spectrum captured by his camera via bone vibrations			1
every colour has a different vibration , meaning different paintings , images or even faces have a different note or sound			2
this audio input was once worn on the outside of his head , but now it has been implanted inside his skull - much like a cochlear implant - he has a greater depth of colour perception			1
the new wi - fi and bluetooth connectors in the chip also means he will be the first person in the world to experience an image without actually seeing it for himself			2
mr @entity7 had the implant inserted during a series of operations in @entity66 between december and this month , and will be demonstrating it for the first time tomorrow			1
he said : ' this announcement is not the launch of a new product and it is not the presentation of new technology - it is the presentation of a new body part that will allow us to extend our senses in unimaginable ways			0
' every colour has a different vibration , meaning different paintings , images or even faces have a different note or sound project spokesperson @entity84 said : ' the other antenna was attached , but this one is inside			1
' there is now more distinction between the colours - it is much wider and more definite			0
' but the most important new thing is that he can now connect with other devices			0
' he can now not only perceive the colours that are in front of him but also colours that other people are looking at on their phones			0
' potentially , this means , that he could also communicate skull to skull with other people who have the implant , but at the moment he is the only one			1
' how this will exactly work and the details will be revealed by @entity7 during his presentation			1
' mr @entity106 recently used the colour sound system to conduct the world â€™s first ' colour choir '			0
to create the music , @entity7 recorded the colours taken from an image of the @entity113 using an antenna fixed to his forehead			2
these tones were ordered to create a musical score			0
@entity7 taught the musicians which colours matched with which frequencies , using his @entity122 app. when the phone 's camera is held over a colour , the app plays the relevant frequency by capturing pixels from the centre of an image			2
each member played , or sung , notes based only on the colours they saw on the tablet devices in front of them and the tablets were controlled by @entity7			2
he first got the idea for the eyeborg when he heard a talk about cybernetics given by @entity143 at @entity144 in 2003			0
the pair created the device and mr @entity7 memorised the frequencies which related to each colour and decided to permanently attach the eyeborg to his head			2
he has since been trying to find medics who would implant the device into his skull and last year convinced a doctor and an anaplastologist from @entity156 to perform the operations			1
speaking at a conference in 2012 , he said : ' for me the sky is always grey , flowers are always grey and television is black and white			0
' but since the age of 21 instead of seeing colour i can hear colour			0
' so i 've been hearing colour all the time for eight years so i find it completely normal to hear it all the time			2
' at the start is had to memorise the names you have for each colour and the notes but after some time all this information became a perception and i did n't have to think about the notes and after some time this became a feeling			0
' i started to have favourite colours and i started to dream in colour			0
' when i stared to dream in colour is when i felt that the software and my brain had united because in my dream it was my brain creating electronic sounds it was not the software and that 's when i started to feel like a cyborg			0
' it had become an extension of my senses			0
