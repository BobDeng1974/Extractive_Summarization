a teenage girl who went on her first ever sea fishing trip caught a yellow fin tuna weighing 250lb , despite being more interested in sunbathing than catching fish			1
five ft four @entity4 , had only ever been fly fishing for trout on a lake before she hooked the monster fish while visiting her father @entity8 on @entity9 in the @entity10			1
the 16 - year - old was more interested in topping up her tan while on a day trip on a charter boat when she was persuaded to try her hand			1
the giant tuna caught by @entity4 , 16 , off @entity9			1
five ft four @entity4 , had only ever been fly fishing for trout on a lake before she hooked the monster fish but @entity4 , who keeps fit playing rugby , was astounded when she hooked the giant fish within 20 minutes of putting a baited line into the ocean around 400 yards offshore			1
it was then an hour and 15 minutes of hard slog as she battled to reel in her monster catch as the fish fought to get away			1
the tuna was so big that it had to be lifted off the boat at @entity9 capital @entity30 and placed on to a jetty by a @entity33 military crane			1
@entity4 of @entity34 near @entity35 , @entity36 , arranged for the fish to be filleted and divided up into hundreds of portions to be shared out among the islanders			1
she insisted that she had no interest in fishing before she was finally persuaded to take a trip out to sea with her father ’s friends @entity46 and @entity47 , who own a charter boat			2
@entity4 who is on @entity9 with her friend @entity49 , 20 , for a five week summer holiday , said : ' i came out here to see dad for a bit of a break			2
' to be honest we were n’t that interested in fishing			2
we were just on the front of the boat sunbathing when @entity47 started calling and saying that we were going through some fish			0
so we went over and gave it a go			0
five ft four @entity4 , had only ever been fly fishing for trout on a lake before she hooked the monster fish while visiting her father @entity8 on @entity9 in the @entity10 ' there were three rods set up and we got bites on two of them			1
@entity47 tried to reel in one and it cut loose after five minutes			2
' a tiny @entity33 woman took the other rod to reel it in , but she was struggling and wore herself out after a couple of minutes			2
she said it was more difficult than giving birth to two children			0
' i then took over and strapped myself into the harness with the rod in a holster in metal plate in front of me			0
the fish took out around 400m of line and i kept having to heave the rod back and then reel it in when there was a bit of slack			0
' it was the hardest thing i ’ve ever done			0
it took me an hour and 15 minutes to reel it in			1
i ’ve got bruises up my arm from banging against the reel and bruises on my legs from the metal plates			0
' it was quite a struggle and a lot harder than you think			0
@entity47 caught a similar sized one as well but it only took him 15 minutes			1
' finally , i got the fish close enough to the boat for the crew to gaff it and drag it on board			2
' then i finished it off by clubbing it on the head			0
i got quite aggressive with it because i was so exhausted at fighting it for so long			0
' @entity4 who is 5ft 4ins tall and plays as a tight head prop at @entity115 , added : ' i have to keep fit to play rugby and i do a lot of training , so i am quite strong			2
i am sure that helped me			0
the tuna was so big that it had to be lifted off the boat at @entity9 capital @entity30 and placed on to a jetty by a @entity33 military crane ' i ’ve definitely got a taste for it - not normal fishing but definitely charter as i think that ’s a lot more interesting			1
' i ’m coming out again at @entity131 and i ’d like to catch a marlin			0
because this is such a small place and the tuna was so big we were able to give a bag of the meat to almost everyone on the island			2
' @entity4 ’s father @entity8 , who moved to the @entity142 overseas territory last may to work with the local police force after serving as a detective inspector with the @entity145 in @entity146 , added : ' unfortunately i was n’t on the boat at the time			1
' i was feeling quite proud and smug having recently caught a 231lb tuna , but @entity47 tells me that @entity4 made far less of a fuss about the fight than i did and that she ’s a better fisherman all round			1
' @entity4 ’s mother @entity152 who is also on @entity9 said : ' she did incredibly well catching the fish			0
the locals were very excited because two big tuna had been caught by the same boat			1
' everyone here is impressed with her			0
she has appeared in the local newsletter and she is being treated like a celebrity			0
her fish has been spread around freezers all over the island			0
