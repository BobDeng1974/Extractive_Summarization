@entity0 admits @entity2 's supporters are being left short - changed as the club 's sorry season threatens to plunge new depths			1
the 25 - year - old says he is already looking forward to next term given the slump in form which has seen the @entity10 lose five on the spin and score just one goal in eight hours			0
but before this season is out @entity0 and his team - mates will have to endure planned protests with a boycott of sunday 's match against @entity18 set to see thousands stay away from @entity20			1
@entity0 ( left ) says the @entity2 fans deserve more following another disappointing defeat @entity2 lost six in a row at the same stage 12 months ago and the atmosphere inside the ground was toxic during the final home game as fans targeted manager @entity29 and owner @entity30			1
one year on and @entity33 ’s threadbare squad is in real danger of being sucked into a relegation scrap should their ruinous run continue			1
and @entity0 accepts that their current effort is far from the standard required			1
the midfielder was one of the only players who deserves credit this season and put in a shift against @entity44 ‘ this is a huge club which deserves more than it is getting at the moment , ’ said the midfielder , who was part of another lacklustre display during monday ’s 2 - 0 defeat at @entity44			1
‘ it ’s a difficult situation we ’re in – we ’ve not got a lot of players			0
‘ but we ca n’t feel sorry for ourselves			0
we ’ve got to make sure we perform this weekend			0
‘ if we play like we did in spells ( at @entity44 ) then we can pick up the wins we need to get this season out of the way and look to progress next year			1
’ @entity33 says @entity30 has promised him that the squad will undergo major renovation work this summer			2
@entity61 was sent off for a terrible tackle on @entity62 to add to @entity33 's woes the head coach has raised concerns about the character of the players after they lost a fifth straight @entity68 last weekend			1
but @entity0 said : ‘ the character is there in the team , even though we did n’t show it last week ( at @entity73 )			2
‘ we had to show a reaction at @entity44 because last week was nowhere near good enough			2
‘ the minimum we could do is be better than the last game and i thought we were			2
‘ we should have done better with their first goal and it was a shame we took until then to react			0
we created the odd chance			0
‘ the penalty decision ( @entity84 was fouled by @entity85 with the score at 1 - 0 ) was massive , it might have been a different game if we ’d got that			0
nothing seems to be going our way at the moment			0
@entity84 ( centre ) was denied a stonewell penalty by under - fire referee @entity92 in the first half ‘ but we ’re not going to get any sympathy , we ’ve still lost the game			0
’ @entity33 , meanwhile , will turn to @entity96 in a bid to save the season			1
the £ 6million signing was only days away from returning after a five - month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he suffered a collapsed lung in february			0
@entity104 – who has made just one @entity106 start – was expected to miss the remainder of the campaign given that it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem			0
however , the 26 - year - old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for @entity2 ’s reserves when they entertain @entity115 this evening			2
@entity96 is in line to feature for the under - 21 's on wednesday and his return would be a welcome boost			1

@entity0 admits he feels sorry for the @entity2 supporters
@entity33 's side have *n't* won a game since the end of february
@entity2 were *outclassed* by @entity44 on monday night at @entity126
@entity96 could boost the club with his *imminent* return
