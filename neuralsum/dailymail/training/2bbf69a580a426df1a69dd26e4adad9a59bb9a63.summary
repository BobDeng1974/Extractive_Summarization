the @entity0 has been branded a ‘ zombie government ’ after it emerged @entity1 will take a 19 - day break because there are not enough new laws to debate			1
the @entity6 is set to break up early for the @entity7 because there are not enough issues to debate			1
with @entity11 and @entity13 ’s parties at loggerheads on several fronts , mps are preparing to pack their bags on thursday and not return until the @entity7 on june 4			1
the @entity6 is expected to break up on thursday , a week earlier than expected , because mps have run out of laws and issues to debate ministers have been stung by the idea they have run out of policies to debate , with commons leader @entity22 branding the idea a ‘ fantasy ’			1
the @entity25 was due to sit until may 22 , the day of the @entity27 and local elections			0
but mps are likely to be given an extra week off , because there is no more legislation to debate ahead of the prorogation for the @entity7			1
it will fuel suggestions that the @entity7 itself will contain little in the way of major new laws , because the two coalition parties can not agree on their final legislation programme before the general election			1
@entity40 has repeatedly accused the government of running out of ideas , and the latest break will only add to the impression			2
@entity6 leader @entity47 said : ‘ we are likely to rise a week early showing that this is a government that has n't only run out of ideas , it 's run out of steam			0
’ @entity52 mp , @entity40 ’s shadow cabinet office minister , said : ' this is just the latest example of @entity11 's zombie government that simply staggers on despite the fact that ministers have run out of ideas and have nothing left to say			0
' we need positive measures to deal with the cost - of - living crisis which the @entity61 and the @entity62 can not provide			1
' it means @entity1 will not be back in @entity65 until june 4 , when the @entity66 will announce the last package of laws before the general election next year embarrassingly mps have only been back in @entity65 for eight days since they returned from a 17 - day @entity72 recess			1
they also had nine days off in mid-february for a half term break , which came only four and a half weeks after their @entity75 break which last from december 19 to january 6			2
in a debate last week @entity40 mp @entity77 said the government is ‘ obviously grappling with how to fill up the hours of the day and the days of the week ’			2
he called for the spare time to be used to allow backbench mps to pass their own laws			2
leader of the @entity84 dismissed the idea the coalition has run out of ideas as a ' fantasy ' ‘ in that way , @entity89 could become a real debating @entity92 , enabling us to debate the issues that affect ordinary members of this @entity25 rather than being sent into yet another recess because the government have run out of business			1
’ shadow welfare minister @entity98 also raised fears that if @entity89 is prorogued early it can not be recalled to debate emergencies			1
he said : ‘ it will be impossible for this @entity25 to be summoned , even if the prime minister wants it , even if the @entity104 wants it , even if 649 members of this @entity25 write to the speaker and demand it , even if the @entity107 wants it			0
‘ we will not be able to sit for three weeks , and during that time , first , there will be elections in @entity110 , which could well be an important flashpoint for @entity113 troops , let alone anybody else ; and , secondly , the prime minister will have to decide who will be the @entity118 commissioner , and how @entity118 will vote on replacements for mr @entity120 and for the president of the @entity122			0
‘ would it not be better if we did not prorogue until the day before the @entity7 , so that it was available for us to summon the @entity25 if necessary , to hold the government to account ? ’ mr @entity22 insisted no final decision has been made			1
‘ we have no intention of proroguing unless and until all the business that requires to be transacted in this session has been completed , ’ he told @entity1			0
however , when he set out fortchoming business for the @entity6 he gave no details beyond this thursday			0
tuesday 13 may — if necessary , consideration of @entity134 amendments , followed by remaining stages of the @entity136			0
the agenda for this week is hardly packed			0
at 2.30pm on monday they will put questions to defence ministers before considering lords amendments to a @entity142 and the last stages of the @entity144			0
on tuesday @entity13 will face deputy pm 's questions , before a debate on all - party parliamentary groups and any other amendments to laws proposed by the @entity134			2
wednesday will see the last prime minister 's questions of the session , and debates on the @entity155 and more consideration of @entity134 amendments			0
and on thursday itself there is only questions to environment secretary @entity161 and ' if necessary , consideration of @entity134 amendments ' .			0

*tories* and @entity62 order break because they have nothing to debate
