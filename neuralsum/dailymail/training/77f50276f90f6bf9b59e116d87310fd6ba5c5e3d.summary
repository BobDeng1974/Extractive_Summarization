it ’s not likely that many will poo - poo this idea			0
@entity3 uses three billion disposable nappies a year - but now they are set to be turned into roof tiles after a unique recycling plant opened its doors today			1
more than a half a million tonnes of waste from disposable nappies is generated in @entity3 every year going into landfill or incineration			1
and despite going green on other issues , families are still buying disposable nappies over traditional old - style washable ones			1
the average baby uses 6,000 before being potty trained and each one takes around 500 years to decompose			1
nappy days : waste at the @entity20 recycling plant but now a @entity22 company @entity21 is set to recycle 36,000 tonnes of the waste at the first facility of its kind in the @entity27			1
it is hoped the technology will reduce more than 22,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year - the equivalent of taking nearly 7,500 cars off @entity27 roads			1
the plant , which opened in @entity34 , @entity35 , is the first of five sites planned over the next four years			2
as well as nappies , feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products will also be recycled			2
they will be collected from washrooms , hospitals , nursing facilities and child care nurseries			0
@entity46 said that state - of - the - art technology will be used to recycle sterilise and separate the products ( known in the industry as @entity50 ) to recover highly valuable plastic and fibre			0
unique : the @entity21 plant is the first of its kind in @entity3 - but four more will follow cool idea : the plant will help tackle global warming by saving 110,000 tonnes of @entity62 emissions a year these can then be used for making new products , such as roof tiles or plastic components and fibre - based construction and commercial tubes			1
@entity69 , ceo of @entity21 , said : ‘ this first site in @entity34 represents the beginning of a £ 25million overall investment in the @entity27 , that will produce capacity for handling about a fifth of the @entity50 waste stream - equating to a saving of 110,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year			2
‘ in the @entity27 , more than one million tonnes of @entity50 waste is generated annually , much of which is landfilled			0
' a significant proportion of which is produced by the commercial sector and we are proud to be working with some of the @entity84 's and nation 's leading @entity50 collection companies already			0
they are embracing this opportunity			0
‘ we are also developing partnerships with local authorities and their waste contractors to recycle domestic @entity50 waste in the future			0
' our plant here in the @entity96 and those intended for @entity98 , the @entity34 and @entity99 will enable both commercial operators and local authorities to further cut carbon , increase recycling and divert waste from landfill			0
’ big operation : the plant will recycle 36,000 tonnes of waste a year			2
