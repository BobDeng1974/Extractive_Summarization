@entity1 's advisor on child abuse @entity2 said there was a ' chumocracy ' in @entity6 looking to protect itself from paedophile claims @entity1 's advisor on child abuse has lashed out at the @entity6 ' chumocracy ' that has protected itself from allegations of paedophilia			1
@entity14 junior minister @entity2 said @entity15 was full of ' too many people with the same interests and the same out - of - touch sense of entitlement coming together to protect their own '			1
her damning remarks come amid allegations that a paedophile network was operating in @entity6 and was being protected by senior politicians			2
home secretary @entity24 this week launched an inquiry into organisations including churches , the security services and the @entity29			1
a separate review will also examine the failures in @entity6 to properly investigate allegations of sexual abuse			2
it came after it emerged last week that an explosive dossier of papers allegedly naming high - profile child abusers in @entity6 had been handed to the @entity38 in the 1980s - but had since gone missing			0
miss @entity2 , the mp for @entity39 , questioned why it has taken so long to take the allegations seriously			2
writing in her local newspaper @entity42 she said : ' why has it taken so many years for allegations to be believed and action to be taken ? ' part of the problem can be traced , in my view , to the ‘ chumocracy ’ that for too long has been at the heart of the so - called @entity52 , consisting of too many people with the same interests and the same out - of - touch sense of entitlement coming together to protect their own			1
' it is this sort of persistent ‘ otherness ’ that so many of us are determined to change , to make the system more representative , more real and more normal			0
some may say we have not succeeded yet but we will keep on trying			0
' miss @entity2 added : ' the other , and more worrying part of the problem is the way that the voices of victims were ignored for so long – children told to keep quiet , ridiculed , or threatened – with tragically the most vulnerable of all being more likely to be targeted for abuse			1
' that , to me , is the real scandal and we must do all we can to make sure that when victims speak out they are heard and action is taken			0
” home secretary @entity24 last week unveiled two investigations into allegations of historic child abuse miss @entity2 also raised concerns about cyberbullying and online grooming			1
' she said : ' there are not just historic cases to be considered and for many it is the replacement of the ‘ known ’ worries with those that are less quantifiable in the modern world , like cyberbullying or online grooming where children are flattered , cajoled and sometimes threatened into meeting predators online or in the real world with serious and damaging consequences			0
' the new raft of online safety measures and better education of parents and children about cyber dangers will help , but it is a reminder that technology amplifies the threats to children that have existed in the offline world for a very long time			0
