@entity0 has taken a step back from @entity3 duty for the rest of the summer due to injury			1
the 32 - year - old revealed that he has a series of complaints which are hampering his performances and he expects to go under the knife to sort out his achilles during the break			1
' i 'm not doing justice to myself and more importantly the team and that is what matters first and foremost , ' he said			2
' now we have the time , i want to be pro-active about how we deal with it so i imagine that i 'll have an operation			2
' i 've always said as long as i can do my job i will manage the pain and get on with it , but it has now got to the point where i ca n't do my job to the level i expect of myself			0
' prior , who earned the first of 79 @entity3 test caps against the @entity42 in 2007 , acknowledged that the decision could effectively end his international career			1
setback : prior was out in disappointing fashion as @entity3 slumped to defeat against @entity47 ' it is a huge decision and not one i 've taken lightly obviously because i could have played my last game , ' he added			1
the @entity52 wicketkeeper has come under fire during an @entity3 slump which extended to 10 tests without a win on monday as @entity47 triumphed by 95 runs at @entity22 , with prior only managing 12 runs in the second innings as @entity60 tore through @entity3 's middle order			1
prior says he has made the decision for the good of the team and has wished whoever comes in to replace him - likely to be @entity68 's @entity67 - the best of luck			2
' i 've made my decision for the good of the team and whoever comes in i genuinely wish them the best of luck and hope they go well and perform and help the team win			0
that is all i want , ' he said			0
' if that happens and i do n't play again , then that was my lot			0
i 'll be disappointed because there are a few things that i wanted to achieve and thought i would , but i can also look back and know i did some pretty good things			0
