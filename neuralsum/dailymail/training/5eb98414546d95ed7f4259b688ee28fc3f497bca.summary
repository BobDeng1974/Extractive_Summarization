last month @entity13 posted @entity6 pictures showing her posing beside dead animals such as a lion , a leopard and other @entity8 big game that she had allegedly killed			1
@entity13 received death threats and the @entity56 cheerleader 's dad @entity13 demanded the removal of the page ' @entity59 ' that featured posts condemning the huntress as well as a picture of a lion smiling atop a dead hunter			1
the majority of comments on the @entity6 page were supportive of @entity13 , with one fan writing , ' we need more of your kind			1
you are what makes @entity41 strong ' fair game ? a mock facebook page called ' @entity59 ' cropped up in the wake of the controversy over a @entity3 teen college cheerleader 's @entity6 pictures featuring her rare @entity8 trophy kills ' credible threat ' : @entity6 removed this page by thursday despite initial claims from @entity81 's supporters that their calls to have it taken down had been rebuffed in a statement , @entity6 said it removes ' reported content that promotes poaching of endangered species , the sale of animals for organized fight or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse '			1
the decision sparked outrage from @entity13 ' father , who sent to tmz the response he got from @entity6 saying the @entity100 page could stay			1
@entity6 has since removed the page for representing a ' credible threat of violence ' toward the teen			1
it came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging @entity6 ceo @entity109 to take down the photos in which @entity13 smiles proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from extinction			1
removed : @entity6 had taken down this photo of @entity1 , 19 , with a lion that she hunted in @entity118			1
the social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards ' for the sake of all animals , ' the petition against @entity13 reads as it implores animal lovers to sign , ' especially the animals in the @entity8 region ... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal ! ' after starting the social media firestorm , the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife			1
in a typo - laden defense that invoked the safari - loving 26th @entity41 president @entity137 , she claimed killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them			0
' this is a conservation effort to assure [ sic ] that they never do become extinct , ' the teen from @entity14 , @entity3 posted to @entity6			2
gone : @entity6 has also removed this image of her with an elephant			2
it said it removes ' content that promotes poaching of endangered species ... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse ' ' [ @entity137 ] was a hunter too , right ? he killed the same species that hunters now chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure			0
' yet , how can it be possible that someone can love the earth , and take from the @entity163 in the name of conservation ? for some folks , they 'll never understand			0
for the rest of us ... we were born that way			0
@entity171 , ' wrote @entity13			2
@entity13 , whose @entity6 indicates she ' is looking to host a tv show in january 2015 , ' said here is n't always space for threatened species like elephants or lions			2
' controlling the male lion population is important within large fenced areas like these , ' @entity13 writes			0
' funds from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their property			0
' ' this is a conservation effort ! ' : the @entity56 cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them @entity195 5 : @entity13 says her first kill was a rare african white rhino , part of her quest to bag the @entity8 game animals ( rhino , elephant , @entity204 , leopard and lion ) legal : the young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she 's doing is fine , since she pays the governments of @entity8 countries to kill the animals @entity13 ' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras , hugging a dead leopard , and smiling beside elephants she had killed			1
one particular photo , in which she posed alongside an extremely endangered rhinoceros , had her critics especially steaming , but the @entity56 cheerleader says it was alive and well			0
' the vet drew blood , took dna samples , took body and head measurements , treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics			0
i felt very lucky to be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the @entity239 population through conservation , ' she wrote			0
however , @entity13 has in her quest to bag the @entity8 game animals ( lion , elephant , @entity204 , leopard , and @entity246 / black rhinoceros ) shot a white rhino , which number around 20,000			2
because of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her dubious standing as a conservationist , some critics say @entity13 should be banned from hunting in @entity118 completely			2
pride : @entity13 learned how to hunt after she went with her father to @entity118 for his own hunts at age 9 ' cruelty ' : critics say she is not a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures boasts : ' this time i got my leopard , ' she wrote a safari when she was 14			2
' and also took down a hippo ' a second petition , this one on @entity274 and originating from @entity118 , is hoping to do just that			0
' @entity1 is an @entity41 born hunter who has entered the continent and has been hunting @entity8 wildlife under the facade of conservation , ' reads the petition			1
it continues : ' she has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless @entity8 animals as a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms			0
