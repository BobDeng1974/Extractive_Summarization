only 16 - year - old @entity43 still lives at home , while @entity45 , 26 , lives with her husband and two children in a converted barn on the 28 - acre estate			1
he said : ' the house is very special to us and it will be a real wrench for us to leave			0
we began refurbishing the home in 2000 and finally finished it in 2007			2
' it was a real labour of love and no expense was spared			0
i especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar			2
it ’s really unique and we ’ve had some great parties there			0
' when he bought @entity64 in 2004 , mr @entity0 set about doubling the property in size , turning the quaint country house into a sprawling estate			2
the property listing boasts of the space afforded by the 28 - acre estate @entity71 once mooted as a possible base for the @entity74 and @entity75			2
mr @entity0 added : ' we 've had the place for 11 - 12 years and i suppose i like projects , i get itchy feet and want to build something else			1
' i 'm looking for a site where i can create my own house and build the kids ' houses			0
so i 'm looking for a plot of land where i can build four houses and keep the family together			0
' we 've reduced the price because at that level the stamp duty is pretty high , so at that price i 've more or less knocked the stamp duty off it			0
' advertised on his own website @entity98 , the listing reads : ' the house is approached through magnificent wrought iron electric gates opening to a sweeping tree lined driveway to the turning circle to the front of the house and into the walled coach yard to one side			0
' the gardens and grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained with sweeping lawns , glasshouses , stocked borders and hidden pathways through wooded vistas			0

' mr @entity0 founded the cut - price discount store @entity1 in 1990 before selling it a decade later for £ 50million			1
the property listing boasts the ' sweeping walnut staircase ' ( pictured ) leads to a ' galleried landing ' mr @entity0 bought the property a decade ago for £ 2.2million but with only one of his children left at home , wants to move on earlier this week the budget chain made headlines when the @entity130 ruled that it must drop its claim that everything costs £ 1 because it sells cds and dvds for £ 2			1
it was a major blow for the company which has built an empire on the boast that just £ 1 can buy anything in its stores			0
the decision even calls into question whether the budget chain can legitimately continue to call itself ‘ @entity1 ’			1
before the advertising watchdog ’s ruling , @entity1 's website boasted : ‘ everything for £ 1 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we ’re still true to that vision today			1
’ under a heading ‘ our values ’ , it added : ‘ we ’ve grown to be the largest single price value retailer in the @entity154 ... we are very proud to offer you a single £ 1 price , that has n’t changed since we opened our first store			2
’ however , people complained to the @entity130 that these claims were no longer accurate because it was stocking dvds of blockbuster films in a concession partnership with another firm for £ 2 each			0
@entity1 defended the breaking of its normal £ 1 price barrier saying the £ 2 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold			1
what 's your drink ? the bar area , complete with what appears to be a mask of @entity180 fine dining : the kitchen area divides into several parts , including a separate eating area that sits eight arts and entertainment : the bar area comes complete with giant tv , musical instruments and plenty of food and drink , not to mention a fetching chandelier			0
