by @entity0 @entity3 ’s latest @entity2 advertisement is a touching story , showing a young boy staring at his phone ’s screen throughout the whole of his family ’s @entity9			1
although his family think he ’s being ignorant , the twist at the end is that he was using the device to record a @entity9 video all along			1
but , as @entity18 points out , the advert has a fundamental flaw - throughout the advert he is holding the phone vertically , yet when he shows the footage to his family , it has been shot horizontally			1
although his family think he 's being ignorant , the twist at is that he was using the device to record a @entity9 video			2
yet despite the phone being held vertically , pictured , the final video has been shot horizontally the camera on the @entity37 was a significant improvement from the @entity2			1
its @entity40 sensor was 15 per cent larger than on the previous model			0
@entity3 has also increased its light sensitivity by a third			0
the @entity45 camera records video in 1080p			2
it lets users take photos as they film footage , and has enhanced slow - motion editing tools			0
when a video is recorded on an @entity2 held vertically and viewed on a horizontal screen , the image becomes narrow and is blocked out by two black sections on either side			2
a parody video of the advert has even been created , using the original footage , that shows what the video would have actually looked like			2
the shots are cropped and detail is missing			0
the advert proved a hit with viewers , however , with many taking to @entity68 to praise @entity3			0
in the advert for the @entity37 , this is footage shot as part of the young boy 's surprise @entity9 video and played on the family 's tv if the phone had been held vertically during filming , the footage would have looked like this instead			1
what the reports do n't mention , however , is that video footage may have been filmed in vertical and rotated to appear like its been recorded horizontally using video editing software @entity68 user @entity86 said : ‘ @entity3 's new @entity88 advert is just perfect			1
best ad they 've done in years			0
’ while @entity91 added : ’ @entity93 advert			0
is this the first great @entity3 ad of the @entity96 era ? ’ @entity99 , from technology site pocket - lint editor also remarked how the advert does n’t even mention the technical specifications of the phone or the camera , yet is still effective			0
heartwarming : the advert recreates all the classic scenes we associate with the perfect family @entity9 @entity109 fun : it attempts to show how an apparently antisocial activity - phone geekery - can be wholesome @entity112 : the ad eschews the typical gadget hard sell , and at no point even mentions the @entity2 camera specs snow angels : the camera on the @entity37 was in fact a significant improvement from the @entity2 family time : the @entity2 's @entity45 camera can capture your 's in high definition 1080p video the camera on the @entity37 was a significant improvement from the @entity2			1
its @entity40 sensor was 15 per cent larger than on the previous model and increased its light sensitivity by a third			0
the hd camera records video in 1080p , lets users take photos as they film footage , and has enhanced slow - motion editing tools			2
what the reports do n't mention , however , is that video footage can be filmed in vertical and rotated to appear like its been recorded horizontally using video editing software .			1

the advert features a young boy *constantly* staring at his @entity37
although his family think he ’s being ignorant , he ’s actually filming them
he then creates a video using this footage as a surprise present
however , despite the video being filmed vertically , the footage could only have been recorded horizontally
