by @entity0 last updated at 9:58 am on 15th december 2011 @entity1 : @entity2 was overcome by methane gas while 2,300ft underground at @entity4 in june 2006 a judge today ordered @entity7 ’s biggest mining firm to pay £ 1.2 million in fines and costs after he heard how four miners died following safety breaches in four separate incidents			1
@entity13 admitted offences under health and safety laws in relation to the deaths of @entity2 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
mr @entity2 , mr @entity19 and mr @entity20 died following incidents at @entity4 colliery , near @entity24 in 2006 and 2007			1
mr @entity21 died after an incident at the now - closed @entity26 , in @entity27 , in 2007			2
mr @entity28 said at @entity29 he would not impose a penalty so high it would cripple a company suffering real financial problems			1
he said @entity13 would be fined £ 112,500 in relation to each incident and would pay a further £ 187,500 in costs in each case			1
but he urged the families of the dead men to focus on the total combined financial penalty for the firm			1
the judge said : ' these were , of course , dreadful accidents			2
' however , unlike most criminal acts , there was no intention to kill or injure			2
' but the law rightly demands a high duty of care by employers for the safety of their employees and other workers			1
' mining is and will remain a dangerous occupation			2
these accidents all occurred in the depths of the earth			2
' safety breaches : mr @entity2 , mr @entity19 and mr @entity20 died following incidents at @entity4 colliery pictured ' this is not easy work - neither in conception nor in execution			1
but safety is paramount in the modern world			1
' long gone are the days of 60 and more years ago , when men were allowed to die and suffer dreadful injury in pursuit of profits for coal owners			2
' prosecutor @entity74 told an earlier hearing that the miners were in the habit of riding the train rather than taking a long walk to the coal face but management did nothing to stop the practice			1
he said : ' the practice continued because there was no practical alternative given the gruelling nature of the journey which otherwise had to be done on foot			2
' the judge today told the court : ' in each of the cases the death would have been prevented if proper safe systems of working had been in place - and if those systems had been enforced			2
' @entity98 , @entity99 of @entity100 , left said there had been 16 deaths in pits in the last five - and - a - half years and right @entity104 , @entity13 's director of communications but he added : ' i am not sure that that is entirely true in respect of the death of mr @entity2			1
in his case the major cause of death was dereliction of duty by a number of his colleagues who , unbeknown to senior management , unaccountably , and probably unforeseeably , failed in their duties			2
' @entity19 , 45 , a contractor , of @entity121 , @entity119 died after falling off an underground train at @entity4 he was riding on the leading car facing backwards as it reached the surface following the one - in - four climb			1
the driver nearly stalled the train then put on speed which jolted the cars throwing off mr @entity19			2
' he was dislodged and fell to the track and was struck by the train with tragic results , ' said @entity74 , prosecuting			0
@entity2 , 46 , a foreman , was overcome by methane gas while 2,300ft underground at @entity4 in june , 2006			1
@entity20 , 42 , of @entity136 , near @entity137 was killed at @entity4 when he was trapped under a 100 - tonne rock fall			1
changes had been made to the roof of a tunnel and short support bolts used which put stress on the sides			0
previous rock falls had been reported but the information was not passed to the @entity147 until the tragedy			0
two months before his death , a miner received deep cuts to his arm as he leaped clear of a fall			0
mr @entity20 , a contractor , was due to operate a bulldozer but it was under repair so he was switched to a three - man team			0
the others were drilling when the rock fell and buried him			0
despite ' exceptional ' rescue efforts he died			0
a fourth miner @entity21 , 44 , was fatally injured at @entity26 when a shaft gave way trapping him under a rock			0
production on the seam had stopped and a salvaging operation was taking place after a new code of practice had been drawn up			0
mr @entity74 said the code , which provided for temporary roof supports , was ' ignored ' on site			0
the judge said he had a difficult task as @entity13 was suffering financially and had seen its share price fall from £ 5 to 29p in the time since the accidents			1
he also said the firm had made a ' massive investment in safety measures ' since new senior management took over			1
he said there had been an enormous improvement in the defendant ’s safety record			1
the judge said : ' coal mining used to be a part of the fabric of our society - particularly here in @entity195			0
' in spite of the privatisation of the mines and the closure of so many of them in recent years , coal is still needed			0
' @entity13 is an important contributor to the economy of the @entity7			1
' coal mined within the defendant ’s mines makes a significant contribution to the generation of the nation ’s electricity			0
' he said the company was ' trading on the edge of viability '			1
he said : ' it would be in no one ’s interest if the company ceased to trade or if it had to reduce further the scope of its operations			2
' @entity223 the mother of @entity2 said after the hearing : ' our family are relieved that @entity13 has been fined over the tragic deaths of four men but are bitterly disappointed at the outcome of the trial regarding @entity2 ’s death			1
' somebody was to blame			0
we know who they are and they will have to live with this knowledge for the rest of their lives			0
' during sentencing the judge remarked that the cause of mr @entity2 ’ death was ' dereliction of duty ' by a ' number of his colleagues who unbeknown to senior management unaccountably and probably unforseeably failed in their duties			0
' one of those fellow workmen made false recordings of oxygen and methane levels upon which reliance was placed			0
' these dishonestly recorded that he had taken readings when he had not			0
' i know that he lost his job as a consequence			0
another fellow workman a ventilation officer who had all the approriate training and qualifications negligently authorised the use of of a fan which far from improving matters was in fact positioned so as to prevent the circulation of fresh air			0
safety breaches : mr @entity2 , mr @entity19 and mr @entity20 died following incidents at @entity4 colliery pictured ' this was a major contributor to the asphyxiating conditions in which the the unfortunate mr @entity276 found himself			1
' in respect of the other three deaths the judge said risk were taken , codes of practice not enforced and safe systems of working were either ' not in place or were not followed ' , @entity98 , @entity99 of @entity100 said afterwards : ' we are concerned about safety in pits			1
' over the last five - and - a - half years there have been 16 fatalities whereas before @entity2 ’s death there was only one in five years			0
' the series of fatal accidents we have had have caused us great concern and we are putting pressure on the industry to reverse that trend .			0
