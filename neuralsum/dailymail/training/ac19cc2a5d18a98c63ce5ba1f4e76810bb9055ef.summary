living in the shadow of a legend is n't easy ; just ask @entity2 he 's had 70 years to get used to being known as ' the son of ' , but there are still things that rankle - and supposedly long - lost brothers coming out of the woodwork is one of them			1
six months ago @entity8 , who was @entity9 's third wife for just 18 months in the late 60s , claimed in @entity11 magazine that her 26 - year - old son @entity12 - presumed to be her ex-lover @entity14 's son - could ' possibly ' have been fathered by @entity9 who , she said , she ' never really split up from '			1
@entity2 ( left ) with his father @entity15 in the 1960s the story had credence as @entity12 , a blue - eyed journalist and former @entity20 government adviser , looks more like @entity9 than @entity14			1
' no , he 's not my half - brother , ' says @entity23 , whose mother @entity24 was the crooner 's first wife			1
' they were n't in touch ; he was remarried and so was she			2
it was a shock when i heard what @entity8 said but i 've since learned she was being interviewed by somebody she regarded as an idiot and when that person made the suggestion about @entity12 she flippantly said , " oh yes , of course			1
" it was a joke			2
i do n't think @entity12 looks like @entity2 ; he looks like her			1
thank @entity38 for him that he does n't look like @entity14 ! i 've never met him but i 've seen his photo			2
he 's a handsome young man but he 's not @entity2 's son			1
' however , there 's no doubt about @entity23 's parentage ; he 's the image of his father even if he has inherited his mother 's brown eyes rather than @entity9 's famous blue ones			1
@entity2 performing in @entity49 in 2008 for most of his own singing career he tried to step away from his father and make his own music , but in recent years he 's changed his tune			1
he now tours around the world with his jazz band ; his act is @entity56 and he 'll be crooning all the old classics in the @entity58 next week at the @entity59 alongside @entity60 and @entity61			2
' i feel like the audience looks to me to keep @entity2 alive , ' says @entity23 , who always refers to his father by his surname			1
' i 've sung my own songs in the past but no one was interested			2
now people say my voice is just like his			2
if you 're going to be compared to someone , why not the best ? ' @entity23 , whose big sister @entity73 forged a singing career and little sister @entity72 is an actress - turned - tv producer , grew up in @entity75 , where @entity76 was a loving but distant father			1
for @entity23 that became more pronounced when his parents divorced when he was six after @entity2 fell in love with @entity80			1
' we did n't see much of him ; sometimes only once a year			2
he was making movies , recording albums , doing concerts			2
of course it affected us but we had to learn to live with it			2
' it soon became clear @entity23 had a talent for music like his father			1
aged 19 he went on tour with his band and that 's when one of the most traumatic events of his life occurred			1
two drifters , @entity98 and @entity99 , spotted his name on a theatre poster and plotted his kidnapping			2
' they decided the best way to make a great deal of money in a short space of time was to hold a rich man 's kid for a ransom , ' he recalls			1
on the evening of 8 december , 1963 , they knocked on the door of his hotel room			2
' they pretended they were delivering a @entity117 package			2
the next thing i knew this guy had a gun in my face			0
' @entity123 immediately offered $ 1m ( £ 5m today ) , though the not - terribly - bright kidnappers stuck with what they 'd planned and demanded just $ 240,000 ( £ 1m today )			0
six months ago @entity8 claimed in @entity11 magazine that her son @entity12 could ' possibly ' have been fathered by @entity9 ' i thought my life was over , ' says @entity9			1
' i 'd been blindfolded and held in a dirty house			0
it was like being in a movie			0
i knew they were in contact with @entity2 but i had no idea what was going to happen			1
' his ordeal lasted four days ; the money was handed over and @entity23 released			0
the kidnappers were caught when one of them boasted about what he 'd got away with			0
@entity23 was shaken but , in his eyes , worse was to come			0
' the kidnappers made up a story there 'd never been an abduction ; that i 'd planned it as a publicity stunt			0
this was much worse than the crime itself ; i was made out to be a deceitful , despicable person			0
and the whole world thought it was true			0
it 's hard to take when you 've just turned 20			1
' even though his kidnappers were jailed , @entity23 says his reputation was ruined			0
' it definitely affected my career			0
people did n't trust me ; they thought there 's no smoke without fire			1
' ' apparently being frightened of the shadow cast by your father is something people think about ; i do n't			1
my attitude is to be what i am , not try to be what i 'm not ' still , he carried on as a musician and in 1988 his father , who he now saw even more rarely , invited him to be musical director of his tour – a position he held until @entity123 's final performance in 1995 , three years before his death			1
' being his musical director enabled me to spend time in his life , which meant i could give something back to him			0
that gave me a deep personal satisfaction			0
he 'd fed me and clothed me and educated me ; i wanted to know that i could contribute as well as receive			0
' they were closer than ever ; but it did n't mean they suddenly became best buddies			0
' he always had so many people vying for his attention			0
i believed the more invisible i became , the better i was doing my job			0
but it was a happy time and when we came to the @entity58 it was particularly exciting			0
i remember when we got to @entity195 i went into his dressing room at the @entity198 and damn near tripped over sir @entity199 who was seated there with @entity201			0
' when we got to @entity202 was there again and one morning he took me down to a pub on the dockside and he said , " let 's sit down , you can meet some of my friends and let 's have a couple of bottles of ink ( @entity213 )			1
" he got me zonked			0
' @entity9 has his own son now , @entity215 , 27 , who has avoided showbusiness and lives in @entity217			2
he tries to see him regularly			0
meanwhile , he has accepted his legacy			0
' apparently being frightened of the shadow cast by your father is something people think about ; i do n't			1
my attitude is to be what i am , not try to be what i 'm not			0
there 's never going to be anyone like my father again and no one knows that more than me			1
