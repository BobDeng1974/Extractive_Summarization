by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 11:49 est , 14 june 2012 @entity2 's @entity1 has ordered for the country 's parliament to be dissolved after ruling that its election six months ago was unconstitutional			1
the country 's top court said a third of the @entity11 - dominated legislature was elected illegally and new elections will have to be held			1
in it 's ruling , the court said that ' the makeup of the entire chamber is illegal and , consequently , it does not legally stand			1
' the @entity2 parliament has been ordered to be dissolved by the @entity1 there was a heavy military presence outside the court as judges announced that @entity21 could stand for presidential election run - off the explanation was carried by @entity2 's official news agency and confirmed to @entity0 by one of the court 's judges , @entity25			1
the ruling means that new elections for the entire parliament will have to be held			1
the law governing the parliamentary elections , held over a three - month period starting in november , was ruled unconstitutional by a lower court because it breached the principle of equality when it allowed party members to contest a third of seats set aside for independents			2
the remaining two thirds were contested by party slates			0
@entity43 's health has continued to decline since the former dictator was sentenced more than two weeks ago			1
@entity45 was jailed for life for failing to stop the killing of hundreds of demonstrators as his regime crumbled around him during last year 's @entity51			0
security officials said @entity43 's two sons , one - time heir apparent @entity53 and wealthy businessman @entity54 , were by his side at the intensive care ward of @entity60 prison hospital , south of @entity61			1
@entity43 ruled @entity2 for almost 30 years , but his authoritarian regime was overthrown in february last year after tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated in @entity61 's @entity64 and elsewhere			2
demonstrators returned to the square last week after @entity43 was jailed for life but cleared of corruption			2
in a separate ruling , the court said @entity43 's last prime minister , @entity21 , could stay in the presidential race , rejecting a law passed by parliament last month that barred prominent figures from the old regime from running for office			1
@entity21 will go head - to - head on saturday and sunday in a runoff against @entity78 of the @entity79 , the country 's strongest political group			1
the ruling said the legislation was not based on ' objective grounds ' and ' constitutes a violation of the principle of equality , ' leading to discrimination on ' illogical grounds			0
' the @entity79 stands to lose the most by the rulings since it controls just under half of all seats in the legislature and is likely not to do as well in the next election			0
its popularity has declined since the legislative election over its failure to translate its parliamentary domination into real political power and its perception as a power hungry group more preoccupied with its own interests than national ones			0
the legal wrangling adds to the suspense around an election that is supposed to seal a transition to democracy after @entity43 was toppled in an @entity51 uprising last year , but has laid bare deep divisions over how @entity2 should be governed			2
the ruling means that new elections for the entire parliament will have to be held , six months after the first vote @entity21 , former prime minister under @entity43 , is a presidential candidate for the elections the law denying political rights to @entity43 's officials had prompted a state election committee to disqualify @entity21 from the presidential race , but he was let back in on appeal , pending the court ruling			1
the drama is emblematic of the tortuous and messy transition overseen by a council of generals since @entity43 was ousted 16 months ago			2
a first - round presidential vote last month pushed more moderate candidates out of the race and the choice now facing 50 million eligible voters reflects a society torn between desire for change after six decades of military rule and anxiety over the damage wrought on @entity2 by the subsequent political chaos			0
unrest has simmered on the streets of @entity2 's cities throughout the period of military rule , with opponents of the army calling for the removal of ' feloul ' , or @entity43 - era remnants , from politics			2
the demand is far from unanimous			0
' @entity21 is a respectable man			0
we want him as president because we are not ready for @entity2 to return to the @entity150 , ' said @entity21 supporter @entity151			0
' there is no such thing as ' feloul '			0
no to the plot seeking to divide @entity2 , ' read one banner in the capital			0
across the street , @entity21 campaign posters were spray - painted red to obscure his face			0
it was deemed unconstitutional because it breached the principle of equality @entity21 will go head - to - head on saturday and sunday in a runoff against @entity78 of the @entity79 , the country 's strongest political group @entity43 , pictured as he was sentenced , was toppled in an @entity51 uprising last year protests held in @entity61 's @entity64 have become commonplace since the uprising last year			1

ruling by country 's top court means new elections will have to be held
separate ruling allows @entity43 's former *pm* to stand for presidential election
heavy police and military presence outside court for today 's ruling
