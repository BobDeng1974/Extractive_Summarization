the 20 - year - old footballer was forced to abandon his car after it became submerged in the pit in the middle of remote woods around three miles from the nearest main road			1
it is thought the expensive car , which @entity17 has boasted about on social networking sites , became stuck in the 2ft deep , 15ft wide , 30ft long puddle sometime on friday			1
oops : @entity4 's £ 100,000 @entity6 got stuck in a muddy ditch in @entity22 but it was only discovered the following morning when mountain biker @entity24 , came across the empty @entity25 and informed police			1
mr @entity24 , 41 , said : ' i did n't really think much of it when i first saw it			0
i thought whoever it was was unlucky to have done that but i also thought it would be gone by the afternoon			0
' when i came back through the woods a little later with friends it was still there			0
' we were all joking about the poor guy who had managed to get it stuck and how much money it was going to cost them			0
the 20 - year - old footballer was forced to abandon his car after it became submerged in the ditch in woodland how did it end up there ? the car was discovered by a mountain biker in remote woodland submerged : @entity4 's £ 100,000 @entity6 got stuck in this muddy ditch to get to that point he would have to have come through an equally muddy section , i have no idea what he was thinking			1
' i just ca n't believe he could have got that far to begin with , then to submerge it in that puddle			1
' we are miles from any main road and the track does n't go anywhere , it 's just mind boggling how he ended up there			0
nevermind : @entity4 was forced to abandon his car after it became submerged in the ditch ' he would have got so muddy trying to escape it too - there was no way he could have got out without getting covered			1
' the international footballer who plays in defence is currently on loan from @entity76 to @entity77			2
his team play six miles from where the car was discovered close to the @entity81 on the outskirts of the city			2
but his hapless driving did not affect his performance on the pitch after @entity77 pulled off a convincing 3 - 0 win at home to @entity89 on saturday			2
it is unknown how the @entity6 got into the ditch or how @entity4 escaped but the car was later moved by a @entity93 and driven away			1
' i noticed a jeep dragging it away later but it was too dark to look at who it was driving , ' added @entity24			0
' it seemed okay enough , just a bit muddy			0
a neighbour said she saw a very muddy @entity6 driving down the road a little after that , apparently it was emitting a massive cloud of white smoke as it was going			1
' i think it will definitely need a bit of @entity107 in a garage			0
' wisdom was not available for comment today but @entity77 said a @entity112 error had led wisdom into the muddy ditch			0
a club spokesman said : ' @entity4 visited a local shop on the way to saturday 's game against @entity89 and , being new and unfamiliar to the area , he programmed the stadium 's postcode into his @entity112			0
' the route provided took him down a less than traditional road , where conditions were also poor , and ultimately his car got stuck and he , along with the club , made suitable arrangements to ensure he was at @entity130 on time for the game and his car was recovered on saturday evening			2
