saturday 's game is absolutely huge for both teams			2
win and @entity2 go second to put huge pressure on @entity4			1
lose and @entity5 will be nine points behind @entity8 ’s side			1
it ’s a vital match and here ’s where the game can be won and lost			2
@entity16 v @entity14 / @entity13 with no @entity17 , @entity16 will be licking his lips			0
@entity14 and @entity13 are both solid enough but they are nervous in possession and they will miss the experience and physicality of @entity17			0
if @entity25 is fit , i expect him to play , but if not , do n’t be surprised if @entity16 gets on the scoresheet			0
the @entity27 is in excellent form this season but the only question mark against him was does he score enough in the big games ? so far in this campaign , he has scored against @entity33 , @entity4 and @entity5			1
he will want to continue that run on saturday			2
@entity17 ( centre ) misses the trip to @entity2 after getting a three - game ban for stamping on @entity38 @entity14 ( centre ) and @entity13 ( right ) are in contention to replace @entity17 for saturday 's clash whichever defender plays , they are in for a tough afternoon against in - form @entity2 striker @entity16 @entity47 v @entity45 i ’ve lost count of the number of times i have covered @entity2 games and wondered how @entity47 does it			1
it always amazes me that teams do n’t try and get pacey players in and around him more often			0
he ’s never been blessed with speed and playing a high line can cause him problems , but he has a @entity63 medal to his name , so he must be doing something right			0
his partner @entity66 is much more mobile , so a fit - again @entity45 as well as @entity67 and @entity68 will hope to exploit @entity47 ’s side of the defence			0
@entity71 @entity63 - winner @entity47 ( right ) is expected line - up in defence for @entity2 however , @entity47 's lack of pace could be exposed if @entity45 ( right ) is fit to start for @entity5 @entity76 vs @entity77 this time last year if you asked people who they would rather have in their team , it would be @entity76 all day long			1
but @entity77 has come so far it is now a 50 - 50 call			0
these are the midfield marathon men and whoever wins this battle in the engine room should end up on the winning side			0
@entity76 can grab a goal , and @entity5 will have to watch his runs into the box , but @entity77 will press hard and make sure @entity76 and the likes of @entity95 and @entity96 have no room to breathe			1
@entity2 's @entity76 ( left ) midfield battle with @entity5 's @entity77 should prove a close affair			1

@entity2 host @entity5 in the @entity101 on saturday afternoon
*victory* for @entity2 will see the @entity104 move into second in the *league*
defeat for @entity5 will see them trail the @entity104 by nine points
