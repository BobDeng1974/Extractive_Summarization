@entity0 have stepped up their efforts to sign @entity2 by tabling an improved £ 25million offer for the @entity5 midfielder			1
@entity6 is keen to bring the @entity7 international to @entity9 and @entity0 showed their ambition shortly after the end of the @entity13 season with a £ 20million opening bid			1
@entity2 , who is wanted by a number of other @entity13 clubs , has his heart set on a move to @entity0 but negotiations have proven difficult as @entity5 owe 25 per cent of any fee they receive for the 26 - year - old to @entity23			0
the £ 25million @entity0 have tabled is a ' take it or leave it ' and the decision now lies with @entity5 over whether they accept and grant @entity2 his wish or they bring an end to negotiations			2
should the move collapse @entity0 , who remain on the trail of @entity60 left - back @entity59 , would turn their attentions to @entity63 's @entity62 , who they have lined - up as an alternative to @entity2 .			0

@entity0 's first offer of £ 20m was rejected by @entity34 's management
@entity36 is *expected* for a medical on @entity43 after £ 4m offer
it 's *believed* the @entity31 ' £ 25m bid is a take it or leave it *scenario*
@entity2 and @entity36 both featured in @entity7 's 3 - 0 win over @entity39
