by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 11 april 2013 @entity1 has released a new online tool in the @entity3 that will mean that anyone can become a ‘ citizen cartographer ’			0
the @entity6 will allow people to add detailed local knowledge to @entity9 in the @entity3			1
it will enable people to contribute and edit map data as well as drawing and labelling local maps			2
the @entity6 will allow people to add detailed local knowledge to @entity9 in the @entity3 it is hoped that the product will mean that users can improve the quality of maps using their local knowledge of features such as footpaths , forests , parks , and golf courses , as these features have traditionally been less well mapped			1
it will also mean that people can add relevant information that has previously not been present , such as the location of post offices , agricultural details , camping sites , barbeque areas , new bus stations , and even drinking water fountains @entity1 hopes that the @entity6 will enable people to quickly transform a simple map into a more detailed and accurate representation of a city ’s local treasures and that it will make the maps of the @entity3 more comprehensive and accurate than ever before			1
when someone logs in to use the programme they are presented with an interface that allow them to add places , roads , rivers and railways , building outlines or natural features			0
click through options then allow extra detail about features to be added			0
once someone has added to a map the improvement has to be approved before it appears across @entity9 , @entity60 , and @entity9 for @entity61			2
@entity63 s @entity62 was the first place in the @entity3 to have contributions made by people using the programme ( the image shows the map of the area before their contributions were added ) image shows the @entity6 after @entity6 users had added their local knowledge the contributions will be reviewed by fellow users , regional experts and a team of @entity1 reviews who will look for duplications and potential spam			1
@entity1 is launching @entity6 with a workshop at @entity84 ’s @entity62 today – this was the first place in the @entity3 to have contributions made by people using the programme			2
@entity1 ’s ‘ citizen cartographer ’ has been released in the @entity3 at a time when it is known that both @entity88 and @entity89 are investing in rival free mapping programmes			0
it was first released in about 15 countries in 2008 , it was then extended to much of the rest of the world but because of ‘ technical obstacles ’ the company has only just been able to bring the technology to the @entity3 .			0

the @entity6 will allow people to become ' citizen cartographers '
people can add detailed local knowledge to improve @entity9
can add everything from footpaths to fountains and can edit existing maps
