@entity0 is facing a @entity2 revolt over secret plans for a ‘ nanny state ’ crackdown on drinking , smoking and junk food			1
leaked documents obtained by @entity10 show the @entity2 leader is proposing sweeping new laws to force people to live healthier lives if he wins next year ’s general election			2
they include banning cheap beer and wine , flying in the face of mr @entity0 ’s campaign to cut the cost of living			1
and it will mean tough new curbs on food and drinks firms , television and sport – which would lose £ 300 million from the outlawing of alcohol sponsorship			1
labour leader @entity0 is working on the the plan which will dramatically change society by restricting what can be sold in shops the @entity2 leader believes his policies will be a vote - winner in an increasingly health - conscious nation			1
but they have sparked a backlash from @entity2 moderates led by shadow business secretary @entity39 , tipped as mr @entity0 ’s successor			2
supporters of @entity42 mr @entity39 say the plans risk being seen as ‘ anti business and interventionist ’ – and reinforce mr @entity0 ’s left wing ‘ @entity0 ’ image			2
@entity0 wants half of the adult population to take regular exercise within ten years of him becoming prime minister the row follows a similar internal @entity2 dispute over plans by mr @entity0 to cap energy prices and rents			1
‘ issuing diktats on eating and drinking and strangling supermarkets and drinks companies with more regulations is a return to the failed @entity2 approach , ’ said one labour mp			1
‘ it is no more realistic than thinking you can control people ’s gas and electricity bills or how much rent they pay			0
‘ we need to show business we are on their side – and stop meddling in every aspect of people ’s lives			0
’ the @entity2 health blueprint includes : the plans were drawn up by @entity79			2
sources close to the health spokesman say mr @entity0 has vowed to make them a key part of @entity2 ’s manifesto			2
meanwhile , mr @entity79 is said to regard it as a vital way of advancing his own @entity2 leadership ambitions			0
the proposals were backed by mr @entity0 at a meeting with senior shadow cabinet ministers , including @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			0
they are members of one of three secret policy - making groups set up by mr @entity0 to bypass the party ’s official @entity97 , which includes union leaders , activists and mps			0
graphic details of the legally enforced health shake - up are revealed in a report to the ‘ society ’ sub group of the @entity107			0
to stop union leaders and activists finding out about the plans , mr @entity0 gave orders that no minutes were kept			0
but a copy of the proposals obtained by this newspaper show they would lead to one of the most radical attempts in history to use the law to change lifestyles			0
among the most far - reaching aspect of the @entity2 plans is a legal crusade to cut ‘ boozing ’			2
the @entity2 document says : ‘ up to 35 per cent of all @entity128 attendances and ambulance costs may be alcohol related and up to 70 per cent at weekend peak times			2
’ sports fans and participants would be the first to feel the effects			0
it declares : ‘ the promotion of alcohol through the sponsorship of sport should be phased out during the course of the [ five year ] @entity141			2
’ a ban on all sponsorship by drinks companies would cost the sporting world £ 300 million a year , of which £ 50 million goes to grassroots activities			1
a total of 11 @entity150 teams receive money from drinks companies			0
the @entity2 plan would also spell the end for @entity155 ’s sponsorship of the @entity156 , @entity158 ’s branding of the @entity160 rugby tournament and @entity162 ’s support of the @entity163			0
the plan is being opposed moderates in mr @entity0 's shadow cabinet such as @entity39 , who is afraid @entity0 's left - wing image will hurt the party in the election @entity170 scrapped plans last year for a 40p minimum unit price for alcohol after claims that it would hit the poor hardest			1
but mr @entity0 will force it through if he becomes prime minister			0
the leaked @entity2 paper says ‘ minimum unit pricing or an alternative ’ is needed ‘ to reduce the availability of high alcohol , low price “ booze ” used for “ pre-loading ’ ’ ’ – or drinking cheap store - bought alcohol at home before a night on the town			1
mr @entity0 will also decide which shelves are used to display certain products at the supermarket , with discounted alcohol moved to the back of stores			2
‘ the positioning of alcohol retail space in supermarkets should be regulated , for example , being limited to a single defined area physically distant from the doors , ’ it says			0
town hall and police chiefs would be given new powers to force pubs to pay a levy to cover the cost of policing town centres where there is disorder caused by drunks			0
they would also get extra powers to remove licences from landlords accused of running unruly pubs			0
similar sweeping measures , backed by law , are planned to make @entity217 ‘ smoke free ’ , with a target or reducing the number of adults who smoke to one in ten of the population in a decade			1
currently about 22 per cent of adult men and 19 per cent of women are smokers			0
‘ helping them quit is not only good for their health but their finances too : if they smoke 20 a day quitting puts over £ 2,000 back in their pockets each year , ’ the document states mr @entity0 ’s ‘ goal is that children born in 2015 will become the first smoke - free generation for hundreds of years			1
’ to make @entity217 ‘ smoke free ’ he would ban smoking in cars with children and introduce plain standardised cigarette packets			1
and mr @entity0 would treat the tobacco industry as a pariah , refusing to have any contact with it			0
‘ @entity2 should become the country ’s first “ tobacco - free ” political party , rejecting sponsorship or donations from the tobacco industry or their front organisations , ’ says the document			1
mr @entity0 ’s plan to tackle the rise in obesity , in particular among the young , could lead to some well - known products , including breakfast cereals with a high sugar content , being banned , with further curbs on television adverts			1
@entity2 ’s anti-obesity plan states : ‘ in @entity263 , 62 per cent of adults and 28 per cent of children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese , costing the @entity264 more than £ 5 billion a year			1
’ it calls for ‘ regulations to limit the levels of fat , salt and sugar in products marketed substantially to children			1
food marketed to children via television should also be curbed by a 9pm watershed [ for such products ]			1
’ and mr @entity0 would stop supermarkets displaying sweets near tills to stop children pestering their parents into buying them			1
‘ they should not be permitted to stock confectionery and other unhealthy foods adjacent to checkout tills , ’ says the document			0
and mr @entity0 would lead a new drive to force millions of people to get off their backsides and get fit , stating ‘ lack of physical activity and sedentary lifestyles are associated with a wide range of physical and mental health conditions ’			2
however , shadow health secretary @entity79 believes the plan should be central to @entity2 's election manifesto he wants ‘ daily physical activity ’ with ‘ an ambition to get half the population physically active by 2025			1
’ the document adds : ‘ we are currently looking at the best definition of physically active for this purpose ’			0
his get fit plan includes a lottery fund to ‘ finance the construction of skateboard parks , bmx tracks , netball and basketball courts			1
all school pupils will be taught to swim and ride a bike safely			0
’ @entity2 will aim to ensure all children do a minimum of two hours of @entity315 a week			2
