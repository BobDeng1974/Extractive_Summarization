@entity1 @entity0 were today accused of showing ' complete disregard ' for road safety after voting against new rules making it easier to track and punish reckless foreign motorists caught speeding in the @entity7			1
at the moment , foreign drivers caught by a speed camera can not be fined because the police do not have the power to trace people abroad			1
but the @entity13 has backed new measures giving forces the power to send fines and pursue foreign motorists back to their home countries			1
but @entity1 's meps voted against the measure , because it also allows foreign police forces to track @entity7 motorists caught speeding abroad			1
motorists caught by speed cameras abroad face being tracked down and forced to pay a fine , under new @entity29 rules a @entity31 source said @entity1 was showing ' complete disregard ' for road safety in the @entity7			1
shadow transport secretary @entity34 added : ' these new laws will make it easier to catch foreign drivers who commit offences within the @entity7			1
' they will ensure that drivers in foreign - registered vehicles will no longer be able to just flout laws on serious driving offences without facing the consequences			1
it is right that the @entity7 authorities will be able to get the tools they need to identify offenders			2
' why does @entity1 want to let foreigners driving in @entity7 off the hook ? ' motorists can already be traced abroad if they are driving hire cars or given on - the - spot fines			1
but the new rules will allow motorists to be fined for speeding , ignoring a red light , drink and drug driving and driving while using a mobile phone			2
if a driver commits an offence in another country , the police will be able to use their car 's registration number to track them down			0
they will be given the power to send out a letter in the driver 's own language , demanding payment and threatening court action if they do not pay the fine			0
@entity31 's shadow transport secretary @entity34 has slammed @entity79 over @entity1 's failure to back new rules making it easier to catch foreign motorists flouting the law in the @entity7 it means @entity7 police will be able to pursue foreign motorists driving in @entity7 for any traffic and speeding fines they have accumulated in the @entity7			1
the @entity90 will apply to member states from may â€“ but the @entity7 will have two years to enforce the new law			2
the move , which is backed by ministers , has been welcomed by road safety campaigners			0
@entity96 , from the organisation @entity98 , said : ' for a driver who puts lives at risk to escape prosecution because their vehicle is registered in another country is both insulting and incomprehensible for victims			0
illegal driving crosses borders , so enforcement must cross borders too			0
' the @entity110 added : ' it 's not right that foreign drivers have gone unpunished for speeding offences in the @entity7 , and we are pleased this is set to change			1
' but it must n't be easier for @entity7 drivers to be prosecuted abroad than for foreign drivers to be prosecuted in the @entity7			1
we have made this clear from the outset of the negotiations			0
' but , @entity1 transport spokeswoman @entity120 said : ' typically the @entity122 government say they will oppose it in @entity124 while @entity122 @entity0 vote for it in @entity126			0
' @entity1 are completely united in their will that only @entity7 authorities have access to the data about @entity7 drivers			2
the @entity29 harmonisation of legislation means the centralisation of power in @entity126			2
the @entity136 may consent to this but @entity1 never will			0
' this report relates to speeding offences ; the idea is to be able to transfer licence points across @entity142			0
not all member @entity142 are the same ; this could lead to unfair cases of people being banned from driving			0
' @entity136 meps are happy for you to lose your license ...			0
just ask them about it in may			0

currently , drivers caught by speed cameras abroad can not be traced
new measure gives @entity29 police the power to send fines to foreign addresses
however , the *proposals* will also apply to foreign motorists driving in @entity7
@entity0 voted against the rule because it increases @entity29 police powers
