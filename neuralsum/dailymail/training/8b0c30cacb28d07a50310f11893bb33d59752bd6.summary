@entity11 were struggling to cope with @entity2 's passing and movement and they were opened up again in the 16th minute when @entity41 made a powerful run down the left but his cross just evaded @entity45			1
but @entity2 were given a warning a minute later when a free kick from the left dropped invitingly to @entity58 12 yards out and his shot on the turn was blocked by one of the home side 's new signings @entity87			1
former @entity2 midfielder @entity60 shot wide from the edge of the box in the 21st minute but @entity44 had a 20 - yard drive deflected just past a post three minutes later			2

@entity11 went close five minutes later when a @entity96 corner was met by a diving header from @entity56 , but the ball was cleared off the line by @entity34			0
the visitors had come back into the game but @entity2 started the second half strongly with @entity38 fizzing the ball across the six - yard box with no white shirt able to apply a touch			0
the home fans got their first sight of @entity109 's on - loan midfielder @entity43 when he replaced @entity34 in the 53rd minute			1
heated : tempers flare between @entity11 @entity60 ( left ) and @entity2 's @entity39 @entity11 made their first change when @entity63 replaced @entity62 in the 57th minute but it was @entity113 who had the chance to open the scoring when @entity61 crossed from the left , but he headed wide from eight yards			1
some of the fluency had gone from @entity2 's game but an excellent pass from @entity43 released @entity38 down the right and his cross was bundled away before @entity45 could pounce			0
but @entity2 finally broke @entity11 's resistance in the 82nd minute when they broke up the right and @entity38 played the ball inside to @entity17 , who swept a first time shot into the top - left corner from just inside the area			1
@entity11 felt @entity61 had been fouled by @entity38 but they responded impressively and @entity60 had a header saved by @entity37 in stoppage time before @entity58 's shot was cleared off the line by @entity41			0
