there ’s just one problem			0
the room is absolutely freezing			0
you attempt to crank up the heat as far as the hotel will allow it to go - but it still is n’t warm enough			2
but one cunning traveller has found a way to get around the problem using a technique that overrides the hotel ’s thermostat			1
the points , @entity30 and @entity32 blog describes a code that works for all @entity18 thermostats			1
@entity18 systems , created by heating controls group @entity37 , are installed in more than 1,000,000 hotel rooms worldwide including @entity41 hotels			1
to override the thermostat hold down the ‘ display ’ button and at the same time press the ‘ off ’ key			2
release off while continuing to hold down display , and press the ‘ up ’ arrow button			0
then release all the buttons			0
if the screen shows ‘ vip ’ you have successfully overridden the thermostat			1
the vip mode turns off the motion sensor and allows a lower and higher range of the thermostat			1
now you can kick back , enjoy room service and be as toasty or as cool as you want			0
to override the thermostat hold down the ' display ' button and at the same time press the ¿ off ¿ key			2
release off while continuing to hold down display , and press the ' up ' arrow button			0
then release all the buttons			0

the trick allows you to get into the vip mode on an @entity18 thermostat
this overrides its temperature range and turns off the motion sensor
