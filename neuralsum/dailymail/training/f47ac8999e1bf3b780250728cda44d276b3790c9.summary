@entity1 's former mentor @entity0 has no worries about the @entity4 's choice of coaches , insisting he has plenty to learn from ' champion ' @entity7			1
@entity1 's appointment of @entity7 has come under a measure of criticism , ever since the former women 's world no 1 joined forces with him in june			1
former @entity15 no 1 @entity13 recently expressed doubts about whether @entity7 was having the right impact on @entity1 - a feeling exacerbated when the @entity4 's season came to a crushing end in a 6 - 0 6 - 1 loss to @entity22 at the @entity24 finals			1
@entity1 's decision to appoint @entity7 as a coach drew plenty of criticism however , @entity0 , who mentored a 15 - year - old @entity1 at the famed @entity30 - @entity0 academy in @entity31 , feels the partnership with @entity7 , much like the previous one with @entity33 , will be a fruitful one			1
speaking at the academy 's visit to @entity37 , where it delivered a series of performance player , coach , and adult workshops , @entity0 told @entity43 : ' he had @entity33 , now @entity7			1
you can always get something from these champions			2
' it depends on the connection			0
but the important thing is that he is connected with champions			0
' these champions , always you can learn something from them			2
' @entity1 linked up with @entity7 just before @entity56 , where the two are pictured together here in july @entity1 announced that @entity59 ( left ) would leave his backroom team along with @entity61 indeed , it was at the @entity30 - @entity0 academy more than a decade ago that a teenage @entity1 struck up a partnership with @entity65 @entity59 , who later became part of his coaching staff and was highly valued by @entity33			1
@entity68 and @entity1 recently ended their association and @entity0 , a former world no 3 in doubles , hopes this decision is also for the best			1
' they 've been together so long , ' @entity0 said			2
' they are best friends			0
i hope there is nothing wrong between them			0
' sometimes you have to make these decisions to make another step			0
who knows what is happening inside ? ' @entity1 in action for the @entity85 in the @entity86 with @entity87 @entity0 mentored @entity1 for 15 years at the @entity30 - @entity0 academy in @entity31 a recently engaged @entity1 is currently playing for the @entity85 in the inaugural @entity89 , as he looks ahead to the 2015 season			1
@entity0 is already proud of his protege 's achievements , including the @entity94 victories of recent years , even if 2014 has not gone completely to plan for the @entity4			1
should @entity1 ever need another helping hand though , @entity0 is happy to oblige			1
when asked if he would consider ever coaching the 27 - year - old again , @entity0 said : ' we never thought about that ! ' but , of course , to be with him , one of the best players in the world , is great			2
i know him since before juniors			0
' the results he has made already are incredible			0
' even winning @entity56 is so complicated , especially here with the people wanting it , and finally he did it			0
i think he handled the pressure well			0
' @entity0 was speaking at the @entity111 's @entity15 coaching tour , held in conjunction with @entity113			2
