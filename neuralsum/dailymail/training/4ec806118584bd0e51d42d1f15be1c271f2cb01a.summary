@entity0 has described the collapse of @entity3 ’s move as “ unfortunate ” but insisted @entity4 will be sticking by their decision			1
@entity4 had agreed personal terms after triggering a move with £ 8.5million bid for the @entity10 international and had even allocated a squad number for him but , at the last minute , they were forced to pull up stumps on the deal			1
the club have not given a specific reason over why they have chosen such a course of action but @entity0 , speaking after @entity4 had beaten @entity18 1 - 0 at @entity19 in @entity20 , offered his opinion and insisted his sympathies were with @entity3			1
it 's unfortunate for the player			2
we are disappointed for the player but there ’s nothing more to be said and we will move on and look at other targets			1
’ if the news about @entity3 was difficult to take , @entity0 did have a boost on sunday when @entity50 ’s £ 20million switch from @entity51 was confirmed and the manager is hoping @entity50 will fill the void in his back four that has been there since @entity56 retired in may 2013			1
@entity0 said : ‘ he 's right footed so he can play on the right but he prefers to play on the left			2
it will depend what needs must			0
the important thing is that we have got the player and we will use him where we feel he needs to be			2
he ’s a player who can still improve			2
match winner : @entity63 settled @entity4 's @entity65 match with @entity18 after five minutes confirmed : @entity0 was boosted by the completion of @entity50 's £ 20m move from @entity51 ‘ i think @entity50 is a really commanding central defender			1
i said since we lost @entity56 we needed that leadership and he 's a player who will gives us that			0
he 's strong and can play			0
i was impressed by him when he was at @entity70 and he was a big driving force for @entity51			0
’ @entity50 will join up on @entity4 ’s @entity73 tour either in @entity74 or @entity75 after agreeing a five - year contract and @entity0 believes his squad is now taking shape – and he is no longer mourning the sale of @entity80			1
‘ i ’m really pleased with how it 's all coming along , ’ said @entity0 , who should see @entity81 become a @entity4 player in the next 24 hours , having agreed a £ 10million deal with @entity84			1
‘ our @entity87 players have just come back			0
nearly done : @entity4 are close to finalising a £ 10m deal for @entity84 and @entity89 striker @entity81 meet and greet : @entity0 signs autographs for some of @entity4 's @entity73 - based fans as they played @entity18 in @entity20 ‘ we have only just been together as a squad over the last week or so			1
i know the group well and i know those coming in will fit what we 're trying to do			0
when the @entity51 game ( at @entity31 on august 17 ) comes up , we will be ready for that			2
' of the performance against @entity18 , @entity0 added : ‘ i was delighted with the team			1
as pre-season goes well , we will be getting sharper in our movements and passing but , at this time , we are building up the resistance of players and getting minutes under the belt			0
‘ in the first half , our passing was crisp and precise			0
we looked real threat at top end of the field			0
i was also very pleased with how we defended			0
we are in good shape and i am delighted			0
