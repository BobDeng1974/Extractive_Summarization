@entity0 today echoed @entity1 with a stark rallying cry to @entity4 activists to defend @entity6 values from @entity8 extremism			1
the home secretary said the country needed to ‘ face down extremism in all its forms ’ in the wake of the murder of @entity6 hostage @entity15 by a @entity6 - linked @entity18 terrorist			1
she said : ‘ we must stand up for our values			2
because , in the end , as they have done before , those values , our @entity6 values , will win the day , and we will prevail			1
’ the remarks are reminiscent of mrs @entity1 ’s famous address to the @entity4 conference in 1984 after the @entity27 bomb attack			1
she told the @entity39 conference : ' we are fighting , as we have always fought , for the weak as well as for the strong			2
we are fighting for great and good causes			0
' we are fighting to defend them against the power and might of those who rise up to challenge them			0
' this government will not weaken			0
this nation will meet that challenge			0
' mrs may ’s speech today – 30 years after @entity1 ’s – sparked huge cheers in the conference hall			1
she also hit out at stop and search laws and the ‘ outrageous irresponsibility ’ of @entity56 leader @entity56 in blocking greater surveillance powers for the police and security services			2
the home secretary – tipped as a future @entity4 leader – said fundamentalists rejected @entity6 and @entity64 values , including democracy , the rule of law , and equality between citizens			1
she said : ‘ they believe that it is impossible to be a good @entity71 and a good @entity6 citizen			1
and they dismiss anybody who disagrees with them - including other @entity71 - as non-believers			2
the home secretary 's address this afternoon came before the @entity80 mayor @entity79 this afternoon mrs may - famous for her ' kitten heals ' - wore black shoes with a gold pattern on the heel on the third day of @entity4 conference today @entity0 will force through new laws to limit police stop and search powers if officers keep stopping black youngsters illegally			1
the home secretary said abuse of stop and search was ' hugely damaging to public confidence in the police '			1
she said : ‘ it ’s difficult for most of us here in this hall to really appreciate the effects of stop and search			1
you see , most of us are white			0
most of us are of a certain age			0
‘ but imagine walking home , or driving to work one day , and being stopped by the police			1
imagine , having done nothing wrong , you are patted down , you have your pockets turned inside out , and your possessions examined			0
‘ imagine you ask why you ’re being searched and you ’re told it ’s “ just routine ” even though the police need “ reasonable grounds for suspicion ” that you ’ve broken the law			1
‘ imagine growing up and the indignity of this happening to you twenty , thirty , forty , even fifty or sixty times			2
and imagine what it ’s like to feel , deep down , that this is only happening because you ’re young , male and black			2
’ mrs may said it the abuse does not stop should would pass new laws to make it happen			2
‘ this hateful ideology has nothing to do with @entity128 itself			2
and it is rejected by the overwhelming majority of @entity71 in @entity6 and around the world			1
‘ so let the message go out from this hall that the extremists will never succeed in dividing us			0
let the message go out that we know @entity128 is a religion of peace and it has nothing to do with the ideology of our enemies			0
’ mrs may ’s day had begun with controversy over her plans to ban preachers of hate from attending public meetings or spreading their bile on @entity148			2
civil liberties groups accused her of infringing free speech			0
but she shrugged off the criticism to warn of the perils of not confronting @entity128 extremism in the @entity6			1
she said fundamentalists rejected @entity6 and @entity64 values , including democracy , the rule of law , and equality			2
mrs may pledged to ‘ undermine and eliminate extremism in all its forms ’			1
she said : ‘ across the country , there are concerns about the way @entity165 law is being applied , the way women are told to live and the intolerant attitudes shown to people of different beliefs and ways of life			2
‘ we must not sleepwalk into separation , segregation and sectarianism			0
‘ we must be clear to people that the @entity6 is a great place to live			1
we choose to live here , immigrants come to live here , and many dream of building a life here because we have a free society			0
‘ we celebrate different ways of life , we value diversity , and we cherish our freedom to lead our lives as we choose			0
‘ all @entity6 people – including @entity6 muslims – are free to practise their faith , and wear whatever clothes they choose			1
they are free to establish their own faith schools and give their children - including their girls – the best education possible			0
’ but she added : ‘ you do n’t just get the freedom to live how you choose to live			0
you have to respect other people ’s right to do so too			0
‘ and you have to respect @entity6 values and institutions			1
these are the values that make our country what it is			0
there is no place for extremism here			0
’ she said @entity6 was not a ‘ moral vacuum ’ , adding : ‘ we have to stand up for our values as a nation			1
’ mrs may ended her speech with a triumphant declaration that @entity6 values would ' prevail ' against extremists mrs may 's speech clearly resembled the former prime minister 's 1984 address to the @entity39 conference after the 1984 @entity27 bomb ' the nation faces what is probably the most testing crisis of our time , the battle between the extremists and the rest			1
we are fighting , as we have always fought , for the weak as well as for the strong			0
' we are fighting for great and good causes			0
we are fighting to defend them against the power and might of those who rise up to challenge them			0
this government will not weaken			0
this nation will meet that challenge			0
' ' we know the overwhelming majority of @entity6 people want to be free			2
free to practise their religion ... @entity255 to get on with their lives			0
' we must confront segregation and sectarianism			0
we must face down extremism in all its forms			1
we must stand up for our values			0
because , in the end , as they have done before , those values , our @entity6 values , will win the day , and we will prevail			2
' mr may added that the ‘ overwhelming majority of @entity6 people want to be free ’ , adding that the @entity6 must not become a country where this is no longer possible			1
mrs may added : ‘ we must confront segregation and sectarianism			2
we must face down extremism in all its forms			1
‘ we must stand up for our values			0
because , in the end , as they have done before , those values , our @entity6 values , will win the day , and we will prevail			2
’ in 1984 , after the @entity277 attack , mrs @entity1 said the country was in a ' battle to uphold the rule of law '			1
she said this demanded ' the resolve and commitment of the @entity6 people '			2
@entity18 terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons to attack the @entity287 , @entity0 warned today			1
the home secretary said the terror organisation , which has carved out vast swathes of territory in @entity292 and @entity293 , posed a direct threat to @entity6			1
she said : ‘ they have made clear that they want to go on attacking @entity64 targets			0
that is why it ’s right that we are part of the international coalition dedicated to @entity18 ’s destruction			1
’ the home secretary 's address today enhanced her growing reputation within the @entity39 justice secretary @entity306 attacked ' crazy ' human rights judgments , in his set - piece speech at the @entity4 conference today			1
the cabinet minister said reforms to human rights laws would be introduced ‘ shortly ’ , suggesting the plan may be announced by the prime minister tomorrow			0
mr @entity306 had been expected to unveil the @entity4 plan for a @entity6 bill of rights to replace @entity319 ’s human rights act			1
he said : ‘ it is crazy that someone who poses a terrorist threat to this country should be able to claim their human rights to stay here			1
' it is unacceptable that human rights laws should back those who break our immigration and planning rules , and yet all too often ignore the rights of our own people			0
’ he said @entity6 should not be told to give prisoners the vote ‘ by an international court accountable to no one in this country ’			1
mrs may added : ‘ if @entity18 succeed in firmly consolidating their grip on the land they occupy in @entity293 and @entity292 , we will see the world ’s first truly terrorist state established within a few hours flying time of our country			1
‘ we will see terrorists given the space to plot attacks against us , train their men and women , and devise new methods to kill indiscriminately			2
‘ we will see the risk , often prophesied but thank @entity355 not yet fulfilled , that with the capability of a state behind them , the terrorists will acquire chemical , biological or even nuclear weapons to attack us			1
this is not somebody else ’s battle			0
‘ they have made clear their ambitions			0
and they have made us their enemies			0
‘ mr may said enemies should be taken at their word that they want to attack us			0
but she added : ‘ we must not flinch			0
we must not shy away from our responsibility			0
we must not drift towards danger and insecurity			0
while we still have the chance , we must act to destroy @entity18			2
’ the home secretary said ‘ at least ’ 500 @entity6 nationals had gone to @entity293 and @entity292 – including the suspected killers of those who murdered @entity15			1
