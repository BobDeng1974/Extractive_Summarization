by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 05:27 est , 29 october 2013 @entity1 is charging food companies thousands of pounds a year to ensure their products appear at eye level on its shelves			1
a leaked memo has lifted the lid on a ploy believed to be used by most supermarkets to boost their profits at the expense of their suppliers			1
in effect , @entity1 and other retailers are charging food and household products companies for the right to sell their brands through their branches			1
food companies prepared to pay a premium sum will get products placed on the shelves at eye level in @entity1 only those prepared to pay a premium figure will get their products placed on the shelves at eye level , where research shows they are more likely to be seen and purchased			1
however , the net effect of the tactic is that shoppers end up paying more for big - brand items			0
a memo compiled by @entity1 ’s cooking ingredients buying manager , @entity40 , and sent to suppliers was leaked to @entity42 by an angry supplier			2
the memo explained that suppliers would be expected to pay £ 30 a product per store for lines to be stocked on two key eye - level shelves			1
consequently , a company wanting its products on these shelves at 600 @entity1 stores for a full year could be charged £ 18,000			1
there was a charge of £ 15 for products to be stacked on the top shelf or those at waist level , while there was no payment for the bottom shelf			0
the @entity1 email also included a diagram to highlight the benefits of being on the ‘ hottest ’ shelf			0
the shelves at eye level were coloured in red and featured images of the sun wearing sunglasses , while the bottom shelf was blue and included pictures of igloos			2
while the system is a clear money - spinner for @entity1 , it also helps large , well - off brands , which can afford such payments , at the expense of small independent food producers while the system is a clear money - spinner for @entity1 , it also helps large , well - off brands , which can afford such payments , at the expense of small independent food producers			1
there has been controversy in the past about how supermarkets have required manufacturers and farmers to fund special discount promotions by accepting lower prices for their products			0
this has allowed the stores to present themselves as the shopper ’s friend without having to suffer any cut in their profit margin			0
@entity1 insisted that charging suppliers more to put their products on eye - level shelves was not new and common practice among major retailers			1
however , one supplier who received the email described it as a new @entity110 said : ‘ @entity1 are making it increasingly unattractive to do business with them			0
we wo n’t support this			0
‘ and as a leading brand , if we are then positioned on the bottom shelf , how is that serving the needs of the @entity1 customer ? ’ the row is the latest evidence of an increasingly difficult relationship between @entity123 ’s biggest supermarket , which has huge power to make or break brands , and manufacturers			2
@entity1 recently took 70 big brands made by the @entity129 company off its shelves , including @entity129 meat pies , @entity133 soups and @entity135 oils			1
neither company would explain why the two had fallen out			0
however , rival suppliers suggested the dispute may have been over payments demanded by @entity1			2
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ we work closely with our suppliers to build exciting ranges for our customers , and make our ranging decisions based primarily on what we think will work best for customers			2
‘ suppliers often request changes to where their products are placed on shelves , for example to give more prominence to a new product			0
this practice is common across the industry			0
