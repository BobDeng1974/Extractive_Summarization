the nurseries at @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity26 have closed voluntarily while police investigate			2
@entity39 stressed that the arrests relate to a single alleged incident by one person on a single child			1
the child attends one of the nurseries but staff move between the three sites , as do some of the children			2
it is thought that police expect to eliminate some of the men quickly , and there is nothing to suggest a paedophile ring was in operation			1
at a press conference yesterday , superintendent @entity58 said : ‘ we do not suspect a ring of offenders , but we felt it was appropriate to arrest five men			1
allegations : officers from @entity39 swooped on three branches of the privately - run @entity68 in @entity37 , @entity36 and @entity26 ‘ we are seeking only one perpetrator but based on the available information we have now made five arrests			1
‘ we are looking for someone with access to the nurseries , either as an employee or some other association			0
some are staff , others are associates , none are strangers to the nurseries			0
’ he added : ‘ the incident is alleged to have been relatively recent , we were informed last thursday			1
‘ it can be difficult to interview a young victim so officers with special training have been working with the child			1
’ held : five men have been arrested over an allegation of a child being sexually assaulted at a day nursery			2
officers have been searching this premises in @entity37 as well as two others the force said the complainant was a ‘ very young child ’			1
the @entity37 nursery cares for 67 children aged up to five , and the @entity36 site for 36			0

superintendent @entity58 said they were taking the child ’s disclosure ‘ extremely seriously ’			2
he added : ‘ our primary concern is their welfare as well as that of the other children who attend the nurseries			0
‘ we fully understand how concerning this disclosure will be to those people whose children attend @entity68 , as well as the wider community			1
’ parents attending the nurseries were given letters by police officers explaining their activities			1

‘ it makes you feel sick to your stomach			0
i ca n’t believe what has happened			0
’ police said a meeting will be held with parents today to allay fears			0
the @entity18 approach to education was founded by @entity161 , an @entity162 medical graduate who believed in learning through movement			0
