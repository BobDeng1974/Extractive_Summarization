a family of travellers who kept homeless drug addicts and alcoholics as virtual slaves were last night facing years behind bars			1
the @entity7 family owned homes with hot tubs ; a fleet of cars including a @entity12 and a @entity14 saloon ; enjoyed @entity16 cruises and holidays in @entity18 and @entity19 ; and had £ 500,000 in the bank			1
but their fortune came from constructing driveways and patios using a workforce of vulnerable men kept in squalid conditions , paid a pittance , and living in fear of violence			1
some were effectively forced to work for the family for 30 years , and many were beaten , hit with broom handles , belts , a rake and a shovel , and punched and kicked for displeasing their masters			1
one worker had a hosepipe shoved down his throat and the men were often made to strip for a ‘ hosing down ’ with freezing water			1
luxury lifestyle : @entity71 ( or @entity72 ) @entity7 , pictured in @entity19 , lived the high life while forcing vulnerable people to obey their every command they told police they were unable to escape because they had too little money to afford train tickets			1
called ‘ the dossers ’ by their masters , those who did try to slip away were usually soon rounded up			2
yesterday , a jury unanimously convicted @entity71 ‘ @entity84 , 52 , his wife @entity85 , 48 , their sons @entity86 , 29 , and @entity88 , 20 , and their son - in - law @entity89 , 24 , of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour			1
there was such screaming and uproar from relatives in the public gallery at @entity98 that the judge ordered security guards to clear the room			2
police began investigating the defendants – most of whom gave home addresses in @entity105 , @entity106 , with @entity89 being listed as from @entity107 – following the discovery of the decomposed body of worker @entity110 , 40 , in a shed close to a @entity106 caravan site in 2008			2
he had been involved in a serious road accident four years earlier			2
and in 2009 one unnamed worker told detectives he ’d had his identity documents taken and was rarely paid and received little food			1
the specific offence of which the family were found guilty came into law only in april 2010 , which is why the charges against them dated between that month and march 2011 , when police raided sites in @entity105 , @entity126 and @entity127 in @entity128 , rescuing 19 workers			1
the family maintained the men were ‘ free agents ’ , with @entity71 claiming they were ‘ good samaritans ’ providing the homeless with food , work and shelter			1
in practice the men were often given just £ 5 a day for heavy labour and emptying toilet buckets			1
and violence was an ever - present threat			0
prosecutor @entity143 said the violence was ‘ a clear and unequivocal demonstration of control and dominance , of one set , the family , over another ’			1
while their team of workers lived crammed together in just a few squalid caravans , the family had several other spotless caravans , which appeared unlived in – with toilets even used for storing wads of cash			1
cruel : son - in - law @entity89 , left , and @entity71 's sons @entity86 and @entity88 were all involved in the family racket @entity161 picked up the drifters and forced them into hard labour for the benefit of the family police raid : bizarrely , the @entity167 kept money in a toilet at one of their caravans video : @entity43 footage of traveller @entity7 assaulting a worker the family ’s property portfolio is potentially now worth millions of pounds , with holdings including two caravan parks			1
police now plan to seize the family ’s assets under the @entity184 legislation			1
they will also seek to prevent them from tarmacking and paving drives in the future with a @entity189			0
detective chief inspector @entity190 , who led the investigation , said senior detectives were too appalled by the workers ’ conditions to set foot inside their caravans , adding : ‘ i have never seen one group of human beings treat another group so badly for so long just for their financial benefit			2
’ the five family members have been remanded in custody to be sentenced on tuesday			2
cramped : workers were made to live in caravans owned the @entity7 family , who had purchased several sites shocking : the @entity7 reportedly supplied workers , pictured , with cannabis while depriving them of enough food to keep them subservient callous : the slaves travelled around the country working for the @entity7 family business and living in a corner of one of the family 's caravan parks keeping up appearances : @entity218 with the family 's patio company workers at a construction site - but many were being forced into slave labour marketing : a flyer advertising the @entity7 family drive and patio service features a landline telephone number in order to look more professional @entity161 ( pictured below on a cruise ) lived the high life while their workers were treated appallingly , said the detective who led the investigation into the family			1
detective chief inspector @entity190 , of @entity236 , said : ' the @entity7 caravans were beautiful , they were absolutely pristine , they were new , without exception , and in absolutely immaculate condition			1
' in most cases the cookers had never been used , the toilets had never been used			0
they lived a very good life			1
' police plan to launch an investigation into the @entity167 ' wealth and to use @entity184 legislation to seize their assets			0
' they are very wealthy , ' said mr @entity190			0
' [ @entity251 ] has been to @entity19 , @entity252 and to the @entity253			0
this criminal operation is not about getting by and scraping a living			0
' i have never seen one group of human beings treat another group so badly for so long just for their financial benefit			0
' mr @entity190 said even hardened detectives were shocked by the raids in march last year			0
' having observed accounts from people that got away from them , we understood that they would be living in poor conditions			0
' but actually some of the conditions were far worse			0
i brought some of my officers along to see first - hand the conditions that these workers were living in because i knew i was going to find it was impossible to describe			0
' this was a group of very experienced senior detectives and none of them were prepared to set foot inside either of the two caravans and certainly when i did set foot in them i was n't prepared to touch any of the surfaces			2
' mr @entity190 added : ' the evidence that we have heard in court is just a proportion of the information that is available to the police in terms of the treatment that the @entity7 handed out			1
' the two assaults that we did catch on video , one was on a 17 - year - old man with learning difficulties , the other an older gentleman that had been with them for about 11 years			0
' he is currently incapable of living alone and is in supported accommodation and will be for the rest of his life			2
i think that is an example of the @entity167 ' treatment of very vulnerable men			2
' different world : the @entity7 owned £ 170,000 caravan park @entity306 , pictured , and @entity308 , which was bought in july 2007 for £ 390,000 luxury cars : the family had a silver @entity14 saloon , a @entity12 , a red @entity314 convertible , a @entity315 pick up , a @entity316 and a @entity14 van the vulnerable men working for the @entity7 family were forced to live in squalor , carry out menial tasks and work in hard and often freezing conditions			1
they were usually homeless , alcoholics or drug addicts and they were used as cheap labour for the @entity167 ’ paving and patio businesses			2
@entity328 was picked up by @entity89 , @entity71 , pictured below centre with labourers at a construction site , and @entity336 son - in - law , in march 2010 and lived on traveller sites in the @entity334 and in @entity335 , @entity106			1
a recovering alcoholic , he did not want to reveal his full identity , but told @entity338 : ' they were keeping us rock bottom and giving us just enough to survive on , supplying us with alcohol , supplying us with cannabis			2
' not eating enough , the coldness , the emptying of the slop buckets for them ... they never did anything for themselves - it was horrible			0
' it was a low point for me , but when i first met the man he promised me that he could help			0
' @entity328 ’s work was monotonous and unrelenting and he was often controlled by violence			0
' i did actually witness one of them hitting somebody with a shovel , ' he said			0
' maybe he said something wrong to him , maybe he was complaining - that was the treatment you got if you complained			0
' when asked why he and the other workers did not leave , he maintained ' it was a lot harder to do than that '			0
some men who left were rounded up and brought back			0
' i did actually escape myself once , but it is hard to do , ' said @entity328 , who is in his 40s			0
' you do n’t have any money , you ca n’t go to the train station and get a train ticket - you have no money to do anything like that - so the only thing you know is best go back			0
' @entity328 was rescued with four other workers when police raided a traveller site at @entity382 , @entity126 , @entity383 , on march 22 last year and arrested @entity89			0
' slowly but surely it is leaving my head , it is always going to be there , but i ’m starting to live back in a normal life again , ' he said			2
selfish : the family spent their cash on luxury holidays , caravan parks and hot tubs while treating their workers like dogs			1

family of five kept private army of labourers in cramped , squalid caravans
the @entity7 paid the vulnerable drifters as little as £ 5 a day and beat them
the victims were attacked with brooms and rakes to keep them *obedient*
slaves were made to strip and one had hosepipe forced down his throat
many were addicts who were supplied with cannabis to keep them docile
@entity7 , 51 , lived a life of luxury while his workforce suffered
