it is a plan taken straight from the pages of a science fiction novel - and potentially a way to exist forever			2
a @entity4 inventor has revealed plans for a system to upload his brain to a computer			1
he hopes to be able to replicate the human brain as a mechanical system			1
around 85 billion individual neurons make up the human brain			1
each is connected to as many as 10,000 others via branches called axons and dendrites			2
every time a neuron fires , an electrochemical signal jumps from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another , across a synapse between them			2
these signals encode information and enable the brain to process input , form associations , and execute commands			1
the patterns may also hold our memories , emotions , personalities , predilections , even our consciousness , according to some			0
@entity12 says the key to this is the sim - a ' @entity50			1
' by mapping the brain , reducing its activity to computations , and reproducing those computations in code , @entity12 argued , humans could live indefinitely , emulated by silicon			1
' when i say emulation , you should think of it , for example , in the same sense as emulating a @entity63 on a pc , ' he told a recent @entity4 conference			0
' it 's kind of like platform - independent code			0
' the thing that makes all of this possible is a ' @entity50			0
' this , according to @entity12 , is not merely an artificial intelligence , but a human mind downloaded to a computer			1
neuroscientists are 99.9 % percent convinced that the brain is a mechanism , he says			1
it is something that computes , something that carries out functions			0
if you can figure out how it works , you can build a replacement for it			0
' the idea that you can take a small piece of the brain and build a replica for it is very mainstream and well understood , ' he recently told @entity92			2
' why not do that with the whole brain ? and then why not upload that to a computer so that we can process more data and store it better , the way a computer does , organizing thoughts into folders that we can access whenever we choose ? ' according to @entity12 's site , : ' the functions of mind that we experience are originally implemented through neurobiological mechanisms , the neural circuitry of our brains			1
' if the same functions are implemented in a different operating substrate , populated with parameters and operating such that they produce the same results as they would in the brain , then that mind has become substrate - independent			2
' it is a substrate - independent mind ( sim ) by being able to function in different operating substrates			0
the popular term ' mind uploading ' can refer to the process of transfer , moving a specific substrate - independent mind from one operating substrate ( e.g. , the biological brain ) to another			2
he believes that , using his system , we will be able to inhabit other worlds , and even virtual ones			1
' it would be interesting to inhabit a more virtual world			1
' or perhaps bodies that are n't built to survive in this environment , but somewhere else , like space			0
' he has set up an organisation , carboncopies to work on the technical and ethical issues around the project			0
' we support practical approaches toward what we descriptively term â€œ advanced substrate - independent minds ( @entity146 ) , i.e. transferring mind functions from the biological substrate to another substrate on which those functions can be performed , ' it says			0
' @entity154 initially takes a technology agnostic stance			0
we organise workshops and conferences where interested parties can exchange ideas , network with others , and keep updated on the latest developments in the field '			0

@entity12 hopes to replicate the human brain as a mechanical system
would allow *people* to ' upload ' their brain to a computer system
could allow us to inhabit virtual worlds and visit other planets
