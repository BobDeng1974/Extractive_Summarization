held at an ' art gallery ' near @entity4 's @entity3 station , it was one of the most extraordinary and nauseating press conferences of recent times			1
it had been convened at 3pm on thursday by the ' human rights ' organisation @entity11 following the identification of masked killer @entity13 as the @entity15 - born @entity14			1
for three years , the campaign group had been in close contact with and offered support to @entity14 before he left @entity19 to fight in @entity20 in 2012			1
but rather than express an apology – or even a smidgen of regret – for having failed to turn him away from the path to barbarism , what we witnessed was almost an hour of excuses , accusation and invective against @entity19 , @entity19 society and the @entity19 state			1
broadcast live for 52 minutes on the @entity36 and 58 on @entity37 , the men from @entity11 described @entity13 as an ' extremely kind ' and ' beautiful young man '			1
the heavily - bearded @entity46 is a very middle - class radical , who lives with his partner in a £ 500,000 house in suburban @entity58			2
despite these trappings of infidel decadence , he has advocated jihad and the creation of an 8th - century - style @entity63 in @entity19 , similar to that which has been imposed in @entity20 and @entity66 by the terror group is			2
in 2006 , @entity46 was filmed outside the @entity69 embassy in @entity4 addressing a rally organised by the extremist group @entity71			2
he said : ' when we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in @entity76 , @entity66 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , then we know where the example lies			2
' we know that it is incumbent upon all of us , to support the jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the @entity87			2
allahu akbar ! allahu akbar ! ' in a subsequent interview with the @entity92 broadcaster @entity93 , @entity46 supported the imposition of @entity96 law , including the stoning to death of adulterers and other brutal capital punishments			0
this week , his opening harangue at the press conference was followed by @entity11 's ' media officer ' @entity103 , a @entity19 convert to @entity105			1
he railed for another eight minutes about the treatment he had received at the hands of the security services ' in very similar circumstances ' to those of @entity111			0
@entity112 , a 32 - year - old former mental health nurse once married to a @entity15 - born woman , went on the run for two months in 2006 after being placed under a control order when it was suspected he was planning to go to @entity66 to fight for insurgents			0
he was later cleared of breaching the condition by a jury which accepted he had a ' reasonable excuse ' for flouting the order because it was making his life miserable			0
the civil rights organisation @entity124 was sufficiently ' impressed ' by his subsequent campaigning to award him a ' human rights young person of the year ' award in 2011			2
@entity11 's research director @entity46 lives in a £ 500,000 house in @entity58 with his wife , but once took part in a demonstration calling for @entity134 the third member and ' moderator ' of the press conference panel was @entity138 , a former leading activist of the @entity139			1
his position is a good example of how the hard - left has aligned itself with radical @entity105			0
@entity138 is national officer of the @entity143 and presenter on the @entity145 , through which he fostered close links with @entity11			1
the group first appeared in 2003 , when it was known as @entity148			2
it was founded to oppose official @entity151 policy on the ' war on terror ' and to stand up for @entity153 who were arrested , captured or killed in security operations			0
critics say it was – as we witnessed on thursday – a sophisticated organisation that knows how to exploit a democratic system which enshrines free speech and human rights in order to support terrorists			0
this is not a view , though , taken by two of @entity19 's largest left - of - centre charitable foundations , which saw @entity148 as a human rights cause worth supporting and donating hundreds of thousands of pounds to			0
some £ 120,000 was given by the @entity170 , which is run by the @entity174 owner 's husband and their children			0
funds from her estimated £ 100million estate have been given to a range of bodies that ' want to change the world '			0
this definition would seem to include an organisation that wants @entity19 to become a medieval caliphate			0
a further £ 305,000 was given to @entity148 / @entity11 over a period of six years by the @entity186 , a @entity188 - run fund set up by the @entity190 - based chocolate maker and philanthropist			1
quite why the trustees support such a body is a question for their consciences			0
probably , it is also a question for the @entity198 to look into			0
sources at the @entity198 believe officials at the @entity186 may have been ' duped ' when they agreed to make donations to @entity11			1
one said : ' they were conned after it re-branded itself as a human rights group			2
' he said @entity11 ( and its previous entity @entity148 ) had been well - known to the security services for some years because of its support for terrorists			1
@entity11 has also worked closely with two other @entity19 - based organisations that have reported ties to @entity105 extremists – the @entity212 and the @entity213 ( @entity213 )			1
@entity11 came to wider attention in 2006 when @entity216 - born @entity215 joined it as ' outreach director '			1
he had been arrested in @entity219 in 2002 and spent three years at @entity220 where he claimed to have been interrogated 300 times			2
he admitted having visited terror training camps in @entity79 but was awarded £ 1million compensation by the @entity224			0
@entity215 , a former @entity220 detainee , joined @entity11 in 2006 as ' outreach director ' and began campaigning for the release of @entity228 cheerleader @entity227 after his release without charge , he has since become a columnist for the @entity232			1
through @entity215 , @entity11 developed links with the radical preacher and @entity228 cheerleader @entity227 and campaigned for his release from detention in @entity237			1
he was later killed in an @entity69 drone strike			0
in 2010 , @entity215 also spoke of his desire for a @entity63 - style regime in @entity19			0
as for @entity11 , it is a mystery why it has escaped scrutiny for so long			1
significantly in 2010 , a director of the campaign group @entity245 was suspended by the organisation for talking out of turn			2
@entity248 had criticised its close ties with @entity11 – which she described as ' jihadis ' – and with @entity215 , who she called ' @entity19 's most famous supporter of the @entity253 '			1
last year @entity215 was arrested over alleged links to terrorism training and funding in @entity20 , to which he had previously travelled			0
as a result , @entity11 's bank accounts were frozen after intervention from the @entity260			1
although the charges against @entity215 were later dropped , it seems from the organisation 's website that its accounts are still frozen			0
in the meantime , @entity11 asks for donors to send money online to a website more often used for receiving charitable sponsorship – or to send cash by recorded delivery to an address in @entity274 , central @entity4			1
it also advises : ' we can arrange for someone to pick up the cash donation from you			0
' @entity11 continues to have a phlegmatic view of @entity19 jihadis fighting in @entity20			1
one article posted on its website last year was headed ' @entity19 fighters in @entity20 should not concern us ' , which undoubtedly could be seen as encouraging or justifying terrorism			0
indeed , the ' human rights ' outfit described the first @entity19 suicide bomber in @entity20 , @entity290 , from @entity291 , as ' giving his life for a just cause , and it would be shameful of us were we to tarnish him and other @entity20 fighters as terrorists for doing that '			0
@entity297 , a @entity298 citizen who was a detainee at @entity220 , has also been listed as a director of @entity11			1
two of his nephews were killed after travelling from their @entity303 homes to fight in @entity20			0
for their part , @entity19 security services fear the rise of an @entity308 terrorist threat in @entity19 is helped by the sympathetic campaigning of ' human rights ' groups such as @entity11			1
as an eminent former counter terrorism officer says : ' the outlook is very , very gloomy – far worse than it was after 9/11			0
and it is not helped by organisations such as @entity11 being basically apologists for slaughter			2

@entity11 held a press conference yesterday to *discuss* identity of @entity13
the group had been in contact with @entity14 for three years
its *bosses* did not express any regret for failing to prevent his barbarism
instead , they called him an ' extremely kind ' and ' beautiful young man '
