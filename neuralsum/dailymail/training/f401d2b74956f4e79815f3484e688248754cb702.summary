' it 's the last thing you 'd expect to see while walking through an airport and glancing down at your boarding pass			1
indeed the one worse configuration you might see on a plane ticket would be ' @entity7 - luggage '			0
but according to @entity8 , a student at the @entity9 , the confirmation code printed on a boarding pass issued to him by @entity13 read as the anti-gay slur ' @entity0 '			1
' at first i did n’t think i read it right , ' @entity8 told the @entity17			2
' i was worried that another customer might think i somehow picked that code			2
eek : an alleged copy of @entity8 's ' boarding faux pas ' as seen on @entity22 , with the confirmation code ' @entity23 ' highlighted in yellow likeness : the @entity26 was set up by an @entity28 charity organization to support gay marriage and was endorsed by a litany of celebrities , such as @entity32 and @entity33 ( pictured ) ' if i were a gay male , i might have thought that a @entity13 worker purposely gave me that code , and that would have made me extremely uncomfortable			1
' the error occurred on a flight to @entity39 , @entity40 , earlier this month			1
while the pass appears to be a genuine mistake , the lettering raised eyebrows because of its likeness to that of the @entity26 , an @entity28 charity set up to promote equality , specifically to endorse same - sex marriage			1
@entity13 apologized for any ' concern or misunderstanding ' the error occurred , but insisted that the confirmation codes ' are computer - generated and are completely random '			1
' we will make every effort to ensure that a similar combination does not occur in the future , ' added @entity57 , a spokesman for the airline			0
oops : @entity13 apologized for the printing error and for any ' misunderstanding and concern ' it caused however the mistake has raised questions on why the combinations ' gay ' and ' @entity26 ' were n't previously blocked from @entity13 's system			1
@entity8 , an it major , said that @entity13 has surely blocked other letter combinations and could have done so with these words / expressions			1
' what surprises me is that they did n’t block [ the confirmation code ] as a possibility of the string of random numbers and letters in the software they use to generate the code ' , he said			1
' i ’m sure they removed many four - letter words that would be seen as offensive			2
' i ’m surprised that ‘ gays ’ and ‘ @entity26 ’ were n’t blocked as well			0
' the situation is reminiscent of a incident in september , when @entity90 , of @entity91 , @entity92 , opened a bottle of @entity94 and found ' you retard ' written on the inside of the lid			0
@entity98 apologized to the family of an @entity101 woman who was shocked to unscrew a bottle of the companys @entity94 and find the words ' @entity104 ' printed inside the cap			0
to make matters worse , @entity90 has a daughter with @entity109 and @entity110			0
@entity94 's parent company , @entity98 , apologized , saying that retard in @entity112 is ' slow down ' and that was what the bottle was supposed to mean			0
in a separate incident earlier this year , @entity115 , the low - cost @entity116 airline , issued an apology to a passenger who pulled his suitcase from a baggage carousel at @entity122 to find the message ' i am gay ' written on it with stickers			0
the man , a father of two , wrote about the incident in a blog , and said that his suitcase had been the first to appear on the carousel			0
budget @entity116 airline @entity115 launched an investigation into an incident which occurred at @entity122 wherein a passenger retrieved his bag from the carousel only to find it had ' i am gay ' written across it in stickers he said he was ' utterly disgusted ' and saw the eyes of fellow passengers ' look him up and down '			2
' i was taken aback by the slogan but thought i had thick enough skin to ignore the leering , ' he added .			0
