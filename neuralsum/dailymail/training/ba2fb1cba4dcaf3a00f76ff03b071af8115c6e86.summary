by @entity0 an 18 - year - old girl died just a week after a hospital scan failed to pick up signs of deep vein thrombosis			1
@entity5 suffered a cardiac arrest after a hospital missed the blood clots in a scan recommended by her worried gp			1
the teenager from @entity12 , in the @entity13 , collapsed at her home on october 28 last year and was pronounced dead within an hour at @entity15 , @entity16			0
missed chances : @entity5 suffered a cardiac arrest after a scan failed to detect ' massive ' blood clots an inquest heard that the student had been to see her gp , dr @entity24 , seven days before her death after noticing that her left calf was 3cm bigger than her right			1
dr @entity24 sent miss @entity5 for an urgent assessment at the hospital , setting off a chain of events that culminated in the tragedy			1
dr @entity34 , a fellow gp at the practice , said : ' one of the things we would be thinking of was dvt - deep vein thrombosis			0
' it ’s a gp ’s role to highlight the risk			0
as soon as you ’ve highlighted the risk it needs to be assessed in a properly set - up clinic			0
worried : miss @entity5 had been to see her gp after noticing her left calf was 3cm bigger than her right dr @entity49 , a doctor at the @entity50 , who specialises in radiology , said a @entity54 ultrasound scan carried out the next day had not detected blood clots			1
but he admitted : ' i do n’t think there ’s any test that ’s 100 per cent successful in picking up symptoms			0
' he told coroner @entity60 , sitting at @entity61 : ' at any stage it ’s a matter of putting together how the patient presents and the blood tests and examination			2
' we had enough information at that stage to say that there was n’t a thrombus [ blood clot ] within the legs			2
' at a follow - up visit with dr @entity34 on october 23 , @entity76 and the @entity23 accepted the findings of the scan , concluding the pain in her leg must have been caused in a recent accident when she had tripped on some wood			0
but just five days later , on the morning of her death , miss @entity5 visited a @entity86 in @entity16			1
she complained of worsening shortness of breath and a chesty cough - but was sent home with antibiotics and a new inhaler to combat her asthma			0
@entity95 dr @entity94 said miss @entity5 had died of ' massive ' blood clots in both lungs , giving deep vein thrombosis and morbid obesity as underlying factors			1
mr @entity60 ruled death was due to natural causes , declaring that the scan had been concluded satisfactorily			2
but miss @entity5 's mother @entity104 said afterwards : ' how can they say an 18 - year - old girl has died of natural causes when there ’s a blood clot in her lungs ? that ’s not natural			1
' commenting on the inquest , @entity113 , chief executive of the @entity50 , said : ' we would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of @entity5 for their tragic loss			2
' we acknowledge the coroner ’s verdict that , sadly , @entity5 died from natural causes			1
' in some cases of deep vein thrombosis ( @entity125 ) there may be no symptoms , but possible symptoms can include : * pain , swelling and tenderness in one of the legs ( usually the calf ) * a heavy ache in the affected area * warm skin in the area of the clot * redness of the skin , particularly at the back of the leg , below the knee @entity125 usually ( although not always ) affects one leg			0
the pain may be made worse by bending the foot upward towards the knee			0
if @entity125 is not treated , a pulmonary embolism ( a blood clot that has come away from its original site and become lodged in one of the lungs ) may occur			2
this creates more serious symptoms such as : * @entity154 , which may come on gradually or suddenly * chest pain , which may become worse when breathing in * sudden collapse source : @entity159			0

@entity5 went to her gp after noticing her legs were different sizes
was *referred* to the local hospital for a scan by her worried gp

inquest heard she had ' massive ' blood clots on her lungs
coroner *recorded* verdict of death by natural causes
