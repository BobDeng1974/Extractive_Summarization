by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 6 july 2013 a @entity1 599 sits outside a designer clothes store near @entity3 in @entity4			1
these powerful supercars , which go from zero to 60mph in 3.7 seconds and can reach 205mph , are designed to turn heads			1
but this one is a real attention - seeker : its bodywork has been wrapped in black @entity11 you could call it a @entity13			1
as a statement of untrammelled wealth , this motor takes some beating			1
normal 599s start at £ 212,000 , but customised versions cost hundreds of thousands more			1
and when that black velvet gets spattered with dirt or mud , you ca n’t take it to a car - wash			1
instead , every inch needs to be shampooed and hand - brushed by a team of flunkies			2
in recent years , around the time of @entity46 , @entity47 , and the @entity48 , the streets of @entity4 have played host to an extremely modern addition to the time - honoured calendar of the summer social season			2
to those in the know , it ’s called the ‘ @entity56 ’			2
in the weeks before and after the @entity62 holy month of fasting , which this year begins on tuesday , thousands of young and spectacularly wealthy residents of oil - rich @entity59 states flock to our capital , seeking an escape from the oppressive heat and ( whisper it quietly ) conservative laws and social customs of their home countries			2
and unlike other holidaymakers , they do n’t turn up with a couple of suitcases and a carrier bag full of duty free			2
instead , the glamorous ‘ @entity83 ’ charter entire cargo jets to fly over their collection of customised supercars			2
costly : a £ 1 million @entity85 registered @entity84 and an orange @entity86 shimmering : a £ 2 million @entity88 car that has been flown over to @entity4 by rich @entity89 who spend june in @entity4 shopping ahead of @entity29 speedster : a £ 1 million @entity92 this weekend the streets around the luxury hotels of @entity95 and the posh shops of @entity97 will be clogged with bespoke @entity86 , @entity98 , and @entity99 , along with rarer brands of high - octane sports cars with names such as @entity103 , @entity84 and @entity104			1
you can spot the @entity106 from their overseas number - plates , often in @entity109			2
most come from @entity85 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , and are in the @entity113 for just a few weeks at a time ( any foreign vehicle in @entity113 for longer than six months must be registered with the @entity115 in @entity116 , and carry @entity113 plates )			2
their arrival draws supercar enthusiasts from across @entity113 and @entity121 , along with a tribe of photographers and videographers known as the ‘ @entity125 ’ , who run websites carrying footage of the most outrageously - designed vehicles			2
among the extraordinary cars catching the @entity132 ’s eyes this year has been a customised blue - and - white @entity88 from @entity111 worth an estimated £ 1.6 million and known by the nickname @entity134 , or @entity135			1
the ostentatious 250mph vehicle , which was also in @entity4 last year , has bodywork inlaid with delicate , highly polished white porcelain			1
watch for the ticket ! a @entity110 registered @entity88 , the fastest and most expensive production car in the world another world : a £ 1.6 million @entity111 - registered @entity88 take your pick : two @entity85 - registered @entity146 - tuned bmws with a @entity147 sandwiched in the middle also making waves is a @entity150 which is believed to be owned by a twentysomething member of @entity85 ’s ruling @entity154 family			1
the vehicle , which retails for £ 880,000 , is one of a small fleet imported this year by the @entity158 , whose affection for @entity4 appears to be un-dented by a headline - making incident three years ago when their turquoise @entity86 and a @entity103 were clamped outside @entity163			1
yet the @entity89 invasion is n’t good news for everyone			0
as the @entity56 has grown in popularity , so too have tensions between the @entity169 and locals			0
specifically the sheer volume of the roar that visiting supercars make on quiet backstreets — day and night			0
‘ even when they are stationary , revving their engines , we get woken up , ’ complained @entity177 , the chairman of the @entity178 , when we spoke yesterday			0
‘ last night i was woken at 3am			0
i get inundated with complaints from neighbours at this time of year			0
it ’s difficult to live a normal life when you are deprived of sleep for weeks on end			0
’ residents are also concerned by the allegedly dangerous manner in which many ‘ @entity83 ’ drive			0
@entity192 contains clips of , among other things , a @entity147 performing a full - throttle ‘ power slide ’ at speeds of around 80mph , around the corner of a leafy @entity198 street last year			0
in 2010 , another car , also a @entity86 , wrecked four parked cars in @entity202 , @entity203 , after spinning out of control			1
its driver and passenger , both from @entity208 , were arrested			0
‘ at some point , ’ adds @entity177 , ‘ someone is going to get seriously hurt			0
’ hey big spender : a £ 500,000 @entity85 - registered @entity213 ' @entity212 ' colourful : a @entity147 , which was seized on @entity215 in @entity203 by police for being driven illegally without insurance concern over noise and dangerous driving by @entity89 visitors inspired the @entity223 documentary @entity224 earlier this year			1
it raised an interesting conundrum : for while @entity83 provoke criticism , they are increasingly important to @entity4 ’s economy			0
during the @entity56 , roughly 80 per cent of guests at @entity4 ’s top hotels are from @entity89 states			1
they are crucial to the restaurant and nightclub trade , and make a huge contribution to the bottom line of high - end retailers			0
figures from the tax - free shopping firm @entity240 suggest they spend an average of £ 1,000 per transaction , more than visitors from any other region			1
yet no one , however wealthy , is above the law			0
in response to complaints , the @entity247 tells me that officers are instructed to ensure overseas vehicles are insured and carry legal number plates			0
the policy made the news on tuesday when a purple @entity147 from @entity85 — which boasted glow - in - the - dark orange stripes inspired by the film @entity257 — was seized in @entity215 , @entity203 , after it was being driven illegally without insurance			1
it spent 24 hours outside @entity260 , before being returned to its owner , who had presumably paid a hefty fine			0
by thursday night , the vehicle was parked outside a bar in @entity266			0
this time , it got a £ 120 parking ticket			1
but to its lucky owner , that ’s small change			0
green with envy ? a @entity85 - registered £ 350,000 @entity147 costly : a £ 250,000 @entity112 - registered @entity274 gets towed away after not having the correct documentation			1

' @entity277 ' sees a flurry of @entity280 owners *flaunt* their wealth
@entity95 and @entity203 set to be clogged with @entity86 and @entity98 this weekend
@entity88 estimated to be worth £ 1.6m and has a top speed of 250mph
