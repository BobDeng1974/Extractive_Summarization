activists have accused @entity1 of being racist and sexist in their choice of figures to create the firm 's much loved @entity5 for			1
@entity6 , which describes itself as a ' girl - fueled activist movement ' , said its analysis found the majority of @entity1 's doodles were of white males			1
it said the accolade was the modern equivalent of being put on a stamp , and said ' it ’s uncommon for @entity1 to celebrate historical women of color			1
' researchers from @entity6 found 62 % of doodles where of white males - with just 4 % black women in 1998 , before the company was even incorporated , the concept of the doodle was born when @entity1 founders @entity25 and @entity26 played with the corporate logo to indicate their attendance at the @entity30 festival in the @entity32 desert			1
they placed a stick figure drawing behind the 2nd ' o ' in the word , @entity1 , and the revised logo was intended as a comical message to @entity1 users that the founders were ' out of office			2
' while the first doodle was relatively simple , the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable events was born			2
it says its investigation was sparked in january when @entity1 featured author @entity47 on its @entity49 homepage			2
the doodle was a huge success			0
' here ’s a theory : maybe it was special because it ’s one of the few times that the @entity57 saw @entity1 honor a black woman on its front page , ' @entity6 's @entity51 said in a blog post			2
' maybe it was special because it ’s uncommon for @entity1 to celebrate historical women of color			1
' although they began as a way for @entity1 's founders to tell visitors they were visiting the @entity30 festival , they have become an online tradition			2
@entity72 range from drawings and animations to full games that replace the @entity1 logo on holidays or birthdays of historical figures			2
sometimes the doodles are seen worldwide , but mostly they ’re reserved for the country in which the holiday or individual is best known , as was the case with @entity47 — her @entity85 was only visible on @entity1 ’s @entity49 homepage			1
the very first doodle to celebrate an individual appeared in 2001 in honor of @entity90 , but the doodles did n’t start making frequent appearances on @entity1 ’s homepage until around 2010 , ' for a while now , we at @entity95 have noticed that white men get featured on the @entity1 homepage all the time , whereas women of color are rarely honored			1
@entity47 , one of the pre-eminent writers of twentieth - century @entity101 was recently honoured with a @entity102 ' but it was n’t until september 2013 that we set out to find the exact numbers			0
' the team analysed hundreds of @entity107 for months			0
' it turns out that from 2010 - 2013 , @entity1 celebrated 445 individuals on its various homepages throughout the world			2
1 ' 9 were women of color , 54 were white women , 82 were men of color , and an overwhelming 275 were white men			1
' about half of those 19 women of color appeared in 2013 alone , so at least we can say there ’s been some progress			0
' @entity6 also said there has n’t been a single @entity124 , @entity125 , or indigenous woman featured in a @entity126 as of february 2014			0
the organisation today called for @entity1 to take action			1
@entity129 , the @entity130 physician and scientist recognized as a pioneer in the research of yellow fever was also recently the recipient of a @entity102 @entity135 , the @entity136 scientist who explained the aurora borealis was recently honoured ' we ’re demanding that @entity1 make a concerted effort to change such a blatant imbalance			0
' we want them to acknowledge the problem , but we also want more : we want @entity1 to publicly commit to improving these numbers			0
' ' @entity107 may seem lighthearted , especially when accompanied by quirky games and animation , but in reality they have emerged as a new manifestation of who we value as a society , a sign of who “ matters			0
” ' just like statues , stamps , and national holidays , you know that if someone is featured on @entity1 ’s homepage , they ’ve done something important			1
' it called for the doodles to include all races and genders			0
' women , people of color , people with disabilities , queer people , trans people			1
' we ’re asking @entity1 to draw our histories , our achievements , our strength , our heroes , our fighters and foremothers			0
you ca n’t keep ignoring us			0
we ’re here , and we ’ve always been here			0
' @entity1 said it already is working to improve the doodle gender balance			0
@entity182 , @entity183 , told @entity184 : ' women have historically been underrepresented in almost all fields : science , school curricula , business , politics -- and , sadly , doodles			0
' we ’ve been working to fix the imbalance in our doodles -- this year we 're hoping to have women and men equally represented			1
' so far this year we ’ve done doodles for as many women as men , a big shift from figures below 20 % in past years			1
' the organisation launched a campaign today to try and persuade @entity1 to be more diverse with its doodles			1

organisation claims it is ' uncommon for @entity1 to celebrate women of color '
says doodles have become as important as stamps for *recognition* of key people and events
@entity1 *pledges* to represent men and women equally in 2014
