by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity2 champion @entity1 has heavily criticised @entity4 officials for their curious planning which leaves him with a ‘ terrible ’ schedule of three matches in three days			1
the world no 3 beat @entity9 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in their third round match today that was delayed from saturday when rain wiped nearly five hours from play			1
the pair were due to be third on no 1 court but were told their match would be postponed for the weekend despite @entity1 pointing out they could have been fitted onto an outside court , replacing a junior or doubles match , once the weather got better			1
in a hurry : @entity1 beat @entity9 in straight sets to reach the fourth round outclassed : @entity9 was beaten in straight sets by @entity1 he said the referees ’ office claimed it would be a security risk to place his match on a smaller court and suggested officials look after their own interests rather than the players ’			1
@entity1 , 29 , now faces a tiring programme of a fourth round match against either @entity36 or @entity37 on tuesday , before a potential quarter - final clash on wednesday			1
‘ for sure i was disappointed , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ if you look for this week , me or @entity36 or @entity37 have to play three matches in three days			2
it ’s terrible for the body			2
‘ i was expecting them to move matches , move maybe juniors or doubles , to make my match or the @entity49 first on when they started again at 5.00pm or 6.00pm when it stopped raining			0
‘ they played doubles five - set match on saturday on many courts			1
i was surprised because they told us ( their match was suspended ) , but then they start to play all matches			2
it was a perfect day to finish actually and they play so many matches			2
taking a fall : @entity1 took a fall during his game but still managed to carry on and win ‘ they said for security reasons , they did n’t want to put our match on a small court			1
but @entity69 was playing on a small court			2
all the other matches were playing on small courts			2
’ he added : ‘ you can not do anything			0
they do what they want and you just follow			0
they just say what 's going to be the schedule and that 's it			0
even if you want to talk to them , they 're not going to change anything			0
they do n't listen the player			0
they just do what they think is good for them			0
‘ i 'm used to it here			0
they just do what they think is good for them and that 's it			0
normally , if the player starts to talk to the referee , they never change the decision			0
you have to accept it			0
’ all @entity103 officials insisted that ' major marquee players ' - of which @entity1 is one due to his @entity107 success - must be scheduled on show courts as ' expected by paying public and tv audiences alike '			1
scheduling guidelines also state that players with ' a large fan following will usually , by necessity , be scheduled on courts offering the greatest security ' .			1

@entity117 beats @entity9 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 to reach the fourth round
game was postponed over weekend due to rain but @entity1 wanted it to be moved to outside court
officials say ' marquee ' players like @entity1 must play on show courts
