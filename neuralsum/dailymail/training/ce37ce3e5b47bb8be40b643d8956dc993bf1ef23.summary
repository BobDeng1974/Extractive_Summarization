@entity2 flight attendant @entity1 , 28 , was found dead in a car park after falling from a window on the eighth floor in the early hours of monday			1
miss @entity1 apparently ran into the lobby without any shoes on as she sought refuge from a man she believed was following her			1
police in @entity7 are treating her death as an accident , but are continuing to question the last people who saw her alive			2
detectives are also examining why miss @entity1 seemingly pulled the pin out of a dry powder fire extinguisher in a narrow stairwell , which filled the area with a thick black smoke			1
staff at the residential block said they believe she may then have struggled to find her way down the stairs and opened the window , which is 3ft off the floor , to ‘ escape the smoke ’			1
blackened fingerprints were still visible yesterday on the walls and window frames in the stairwell , as well as on a door , which led to a locked ‘ lift mechanics ’ room			2
a newspaper delivery man said miss @entity1 entered the @entity47 building in @entity7 at about 4.15am and appeared ‘ drunk ’ and in distress			1
he also saw a man who miss @entity1 may have feared was following her			1
he said : ' she had no shoes on			2
i got into the elevator to go up to the fourth floor			2
but just as the doors were closing , the woman put her hand in to stop the lift and stepped inside			0
the man did not take the lift			0
‘ she was cowering with fear and it appeared she was being followed by the @entity64 man			0
she kept saying “ someone is trying to kill me ”			0
as she spoke , there was a strong smell of alcohol			0
i told her to call the police or i could do it for her			0
but she said no. ’ miss @entity1 , from @entity71 , @entity72 , reportedly got out on the third floor and headed towards the stairwell , while the delivery man continued to distribute papers to the fourth and fifth floors			1
when he returned to the lobby he told security guard @entity79 , who had been on a break when miss @entity1 arrived , about the incident			1
mr @entity79 , 33 , told the @entity82 : ‘ i searched all the floors and , when i got to the second floor , i heard a loud bang			2
i think now that was miss @entity1 falling			1
’ he searched the building twice but initially did not think to check the eighth floor , which holds a locked rooftop terrace and the mechanics room , because it is usually for ‘ authorised personnel ’ only			1
however , when he failed to find miss @entity1 , he opened the door to the eighth floor stairwell and was shocked to discover it was filled with a black powder			1
he said : ‘ i got very scared for her			0
i thought the powder was smoke , so i thought perhaps there had been a fire			0
miss @entity1 apparently ran into the lobby of the @entity100 ( above ) without any shoes on as she sought refuge from a man she believed was following her ‘ i ran to the watchman ’s flat on the third floor and asked him to check the stairwell because there was smoke , while i went outside			1
’ the watchman discovered an open window and a woman ’s brown handbag on the floor nearby			1
next to the handbag was a pin for the fire extinguisher , which was still hanging on the wall			0
mr @entity79 said : ‘ i think when she used the fire extinguisher she could n’t see anything or anywhere to escape			0
maybe she opened the window and fell or jumped			1
’ he walked around the outside of the building , where he found miss @entity1 ’s body beneath the eighth floor window			1
he made the discovery at 4.37am , around 20 minutes after she entered the building			0
‘ she had already died , ’ he said			0
mr @entity79 , a father - of - one from @entity128 , added : ‘ it is very sad			0
’ miss @entity1 had been working for @entity2 since june and , two days prior to her death , had returned from a six - day working trip to @entity132 and @entity133 he questioned why she had entered the ordinary residential building , saying : ‘ i do n’t know why she was in here at night			1
she was definitely not living here			0
' the air hostesses live in high - class buildings owned by @entity2			1
there is one just up the road			0
but this building is normal , it is not the quality that they are used to			0
’ he said he understood the newspaper delivery man saw an @entity150 man follow miss @entity1 into the building and loiter in the lobby			1
he added : ‘ he did not enter the elevator and he was not a resident here			0
’ the delivery man added : ‘ when i [ returned to ] the lobby , the man was still there and asked me in @entity157 if the woman lived in the building			0
i ignored him and walked away			0
’ it is still unclear what miss @entity1 was doing in the residential @entity7 district , two miles from her flat			2
she is understood to have shared a three - bedroom apartment with fellow air hostesses in a 28 - floor apartment block for @entity2 staff , in the heart of the business district			1
reports suggested she was on a night out with friends and may have gone on to an after - party when @entity7 ’s bars shut at 3am			0
she had been working for @entity2 since june and , two days prior to her death , had returned from a six - day working trip to @entity132 and @entity133			2
her parents @entity176 and @entity177 and brother @entity178 , 23 , are believed to have flown out to @entity7			0
a spokesman for @entity2 said : ‘ our sympathies go out to her family who are currently being supported by our staff			2
’ on a @entity185 tribute page , friends said miss @entity1 had ‘ a heart of gold ’ and ‘ wanted to help everyone in need ’			2
an @entity150 man also reportedly died the same night in @entity7 from falling from a 10th - floor apartment .			2
