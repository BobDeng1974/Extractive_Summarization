voters can not understand why the bankers who oversaw the collapse of @entity4 have not been pursued by prosecutors , @entity0 said last night			1
the business secretary piled pressure on the authorities to bring @entity9 and other former bosses to account			1
a legal report prepared for mr @entity0 is understood to have concluded there was ' prosecutable evidence ' against several of the bank 's executives			1
they steered @entity4 into the biggest corporate disaster in @entity20 history , leaving taxpayers with a £ 45billion bill for its rescue			1
he is now understood to have asked lord advocate @entity34 – @entity32 's chief public prosecutor – why there has been no resolution three years on			2
as well as mr @entity9 , who was stripped of his knighthood in 2012 , it is believed that @entity40 , the former head of @entity4 's investment bank , and a few other directors might also be pursued			1
disqualification , which would ban them from sitting on company boards , could be enacted by the courts or through civil action			2
mr @entity0 told the @entity49 : ' the investigation into the misconduct of directors at @entity4 has been a long and complicated affair			1
' i have spoken to the lord advocate , who is responsible for overseeing the investigation in @entity32 , and he has updated me on the latest progress of the investigation			2
' whilst i fully appreciate the complexity and volume of the materials being investigated , i also have a lot of sympathy with ordinary members of the public who can not understand why it has so far taken three years to look into this			2
accountable : the business secretary piled pressure on the authorities to bring former @entity4 chief executive @entity9 ( pictured in 2009 ) and other former bosses to account ' i will be keeping abreast of any further developments and will continue to press for these investigations to be concluded as speedily as possible			1
' aides stressed that mr @entity0 was not seeking to influence the outcome , but believed voters were angry about the lack of accountability			1
watchdogs who investigated the collapse of @entity4 found that its directors made a number of poor decisions in the run - up to @entity88 's £ 45billion bailout of the bank			1
the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) concluded bosses had aggressively expanded the institution during mr @entity9 's eight - year tenure in charge , culminating in the disastrous acquisition of @entity96 in 2007			1
it found @entity4 had been brought to its knees by ' multiple poor decisions ' and a £ 50billion ' gamble ' on buying the @entity101 bank			1
the @entity90 report detailed the strained relationship between the watchdog and mr @entity9 before 2005 , in particular @entity4 's reluctance to allow its non-executive directors to meet the @entity90 one - to - one			1
' @entity90 supervisory records from 2004 suggest that @entity4 management , and in particular the @entity4 chief executive , had been resistant to what they saw as unnecessary @entity90 interference , ' the watchdog said			1
economic failings : @entity4 bosses steered the company into the biggest corporate disaster in @entity20 history , @entity0 said ( file photo ) the @entity90 said mr @entity9 pushed ahead with the reckless @entity96 deal without ' a sufficient understanding of the risks involved '			1
it added that many would find the idea that no director would face sanctions ' difficult to accept ' , adding : ' surely someone can and should be held responsible			2
' the report also concluded that mr @entity9 's ' robust and assertive ' management style had been flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003			1
the banker won his knighthood under the last government in 2004 , only to see it removed by a @entity137 committee following pressure from prime minister @entity139			2
a @entity31 spokesman said : ' the lord advocate instructed an investigation into allegations involving the @entity32 banking sector			2
' that investigation is being led by the @entity31 and @entity146 and @entity147 , with assistance from expert forensic accountants and banking specialists			2
the investigation is complex and ongoing			0
' the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of @entity20 's biggest mis - selling scandal from making a claim			0
banks have so far paid out £ 17.3billion to those who were wrongly sold @entity159 alongside loans and credit cards			1
if the @entity152 proposals are passed , then victims could be barred from making a claim three years after they first realised the mis - selling had taken place			0
the @entity168 watchdog will announce its plans in the summer , which could involve introducing the deadline , an advertising campaign to alert mis - selling victims who have not yet put in a claim , or other rule changes			0
@entity175 , of @entity176 , said : ' the banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years			0
' to make it work fairly for consumers they 'd need to put out a multi-million pound advertising campaign over the few years before the limit , so people know they have been mis - sold			0
deadline : the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of @entity20 's biggest mis - selling scandal from making a claim ( file photo ) @entity175 ( pictured ) , of @entity176 , said : ' the banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years ' more importantly they 'd need to ensure they stop rejecting people who they know the ombudsman would order them to pay out to , knowing most people wo n't take it this far ... i ca n't see either of those things happening , so a time limit should be a strict no - go			0
' tens of millions of @entity159 policies were sold between 1990 and 2010 to people taking out loans , mortgages and credit cards			0
they were supposed to protect borrowers who fell ill or lost their jobs			0
but banks routinely flogged the cover to customers who could never make a claim because they were ineligible to do so			0
often , victims had no idea they had even been paying for the cover for years			0
since the scandal broke , banks have been inundated with @entity159 complaints			0
although many of these come from actual wronged customers , others are driven by claims from management firms who sign people up by bombarding them with texts and phone calls			0
alongside millions of legitimate claims , banks say they have also spent vast sums wading through vexatious and speculative claims made by these firms			1
the independent @entity235 says it is receiving around 4,000 @entity159 complaints a week , down from a peak of 12,000			0
it finds in the customer 's favour in roughly two - thirds of cases			0
@entity242 , founder of the @entity243 , said : ' i fear that the majority of people who would lose out by a deadline would be those who are vulnerable or elderly			0
the banks had their hands in customers ' pockets for years			0
victims should n't be allowed to be the fall guy a second time around			0

there is ' prosecutable evidence ' against them a legal report has concluded
tax payers paid £ 45billion to rescue @entity264 from ' disaster '
watchdogs investigating @entity4 collapse said directors made poor decisions
