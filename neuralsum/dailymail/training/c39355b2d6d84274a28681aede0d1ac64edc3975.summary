by @entity0 published : 13:25 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 05:56 est , 29 november 2012 he has been left without a buddy since the departure of his best friend @entity4 from the today show			0
and now @entity7 chiefs are keen to find @entity8 a new ' bromance ' on the ailing breakfast show in a desperate bid to increase ratings			1
they want to hark back to the chemistry @entity8 , 54 , found with @entity4 , 64 , who left the show after 15 years as co-host in january 1997			1
ahead of the arrival of @entity5 's new executives @entity18 and @entity19 next week , a source told @entity21 : ' if you look at @entity23 and @entity24 on @entity25 , they are really great friends and that shines through on air - not since @entity8 and @entity4 have we seen chemistry like this on morning tv			1
' frosty : @entity8 and his wife @entity33 at the @entity34 at @entity35 in @entity36 on tuesday night there is no love lost between @entity8 and @entity5 's other senior male presenter @entity39 - who is close friends with @entity41			1
@entity41 , 56 , was unceremoniously axed in june after just a year as today 's co-host , a move that has been blamed on @entity8 , who last night made a rare public appearance with his wife @entity33 at @entity46 's @entity34 in @entity36			1
a senior tv source denied recent rumours that @entity8 - who is on a staggering $ 25 million - a - year - deal - would be axed after @entity25 took over today 's top spot in the ratings			1
the source , close to the today show , said : ' @entity8 is on a huge deal , he 's hugely important to @entity7 - he 's not going anywhere			1
' another source added : ' there is no chance in hell that @entity8 's getting fired			1
' of course , there are huge issues at today and the big problem will be when the affiliates who pay all the money to air today start complaining about ratings - they 're never afraid to call a spade a spade			0
' every ratings point is worth millions in advertising revenue and today knows it 's not going to win its spot back overnight			0
' we 're waiting to see if @entity19 can do something bold			0
the consensus in the corridors at @entity7 is that today desperately needs the right team			0
' they need chemistry and the anchors need people to play with			0
' viewers like to see the presenters connecting , it 's all about connectibility and there 's no - one for @entity8 to banter with			1
' best friends : @entity8 and former today co-host @entity4 veteran : @entity4 and his wife @entity90 joined @entity8 and @entity91 at the @entity34 on tuesday night ' and when push comes to shove , viewers know nothing about @entity95 is super smart , but again , viewers know nothing about her			2
' on @entity25 , people know that @entity24 's getting married , @entity23 talks all the time about his daughter , they 're going through @entity103 ' illness with her and @entity104 just does n't stop talking ! ' in effect , today needs to find its ' secret sauce '			1
@entity7 chiefs are already trying out new talent on air			0
@entity110 has been moved to the 9am slot and is proving popular as a stand - in for @entity8 , while other presenters are being trialled			2

today is down about 15 per cent			0

chemistry : @entity25 's @entity23 and @entity24 on air together last week earlier this month , @entity7 announced today 's long - time executive producer @entity121 - a good friend of @entity8 - was being replaced by veteran news executives to take over the troubled morning programme			1
@entity19 , 47 , a 23 - year veteran of the show , is taking over as executive producer , and will be responsible for all four hours of today			0
he starts on tuesday , and will report to @entity18 , who was promoted to the newly created role of executive in charge of the today show			0
@entity130 , 47 , will continue as executive producer of @entity7 's prime time news programme , @entity133 with @entity134 , which is also struggling and faces the axe , according to tv insiders			2
what 's up @entity39 : today stars @entity95 and @entity8 share a joke with @entity140 this week - but @entity39 does n't look so happy @entity4 , who co-hosted today alongside @entity141 , acknowledged that he is ' best friends ' with @entity8 as he spoke out following @entity41 's departure			1
he spoke out in @entity8 's defence as he told the @entity145 : ' i ’m surprised and disappointed at this idea that @entity41 was a martyr , that she was thrown under the bus			1
' i do n’t know why she ’s being portrayed as a modern - day @entity150			0
in every job , in every walk of life , people are hired to do a job , and if they do n't do it well they are relieved of that job			0
' the outspoken star added : ' it ’s a big - boy business , and when things do n’t work out , people are asked to leave			0
it ’s happened to me ; it ’s happened to almost everyone in this business , ; @entity4 said he does n’t watch today , in keeping with a practice he began during his own run between 1982 and 1997 , adding : ' i ’m not a tv watcher and i ’m not a morning - show watcher			0
' as for @entity95 , @entity4 added : ' @entity8 tells me she ’s a good person , and i believe him			2

tv execs want to rival the chemistry @entity174 rival @entity25 has found between @entity23 and @entity24
