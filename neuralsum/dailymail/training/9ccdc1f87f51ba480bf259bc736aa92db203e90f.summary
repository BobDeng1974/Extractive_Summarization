in the underworld of illegal drug trafficking , identical twins @entity1 and @entity2 rose from middling @entity6 dealers to partners of @entity9 's most notorious cartel lord , eventually building a nearly $ 2 billion franchise that spanned much of @entity11			1
anyone convicted of trafficking a fraction as much cocaine and heroin could normally expect a life sentence			0
but the twins can enter their sentencing hearing tuesday confident of receiving far less			1
because they spilled secrets that led to the indictments of @entity23 ' @entity22 , a half - dozen of his lieutenants and about 40 lower - level traffickers , prosecutors are asking for a remarkably lenient term — around 10 years			1
if credited for six years in protective custody , the pair could go free within a few years			2
' i do n't think you can get bigger than that			0
' details of the twins ' story have been kept under seal for years , but recently opened federal government files , and an @entity55 review of documents in related cases , have lifted some of the secrecy surrounding the two , offering a fuller narrative of their journey from flamboyant teen traffickers to associates of @entity22 , who was captured last year by @entity9 authorities			1
@entity67 authorities portray the twins as among the most valuable drug traffickers who ever became informants			1
@entity6 criminal lawyer @entity71 , who represented several clients indicted on evidence from the twins , put it more starkly : ' they 're some of the most significant rats in @entity67 history			1
' drug - world figures weighed in on their importance , too , in their own way			1
after word spread in mid- 2009 that the twins had turned informants , their father was kidnapped , according to government documents			1
a note left for the twins on the windshield of his abandoned car read , ' shut up or we are going to send you his head			2
' he is presumed dead			0
the twins cooperation with authorities led to the indictments of @entity23 ' @entity22 , above , a half - dozen of his lieutenants and about 40 lower - level traffickers , prosecutors are asking for a remarkably lenient term — around 10 years prosecutors cited his death and the fact that the twins — as well as their mother , wives and children — will live in fear for the rest of their lives as one reason for leniency			1
they also want to use the lighter sentence as an enticement to urge other cartel associates to cooperate			0
the threat of retaliation by cartel members looms over the case			0
since becoming informants , the 33 - year - old siblings have never appeared in public			1
because of the constant danger , the name of their defense attorney has also been kept secret			0
and it 's unclear how the brothers will be protected in prison or after their release			2
the speed with which the 5 - foot - 4 twins ascended the drug - world hierarchy had something to do with location			1
@entity6 's @entity137 neighborhood , where they grew up , is surrounded by major rail lines and highways			0
it 's an aspiring trafficker 's dream — a transportation hub within a city that 's a transportation hub to the nation			0
as dealers in their teens , they had a reputation for being flashy but savvy , said @entity71 , who had some clients from the same neighborhood			0
the twins ' fondness for bling was illustrated by a list of items agents said they would forfeit			2
it included more than $ 400,000 in jewelry			0
only after the brothers fled @entity6 around 2004 for @entity9 , apparently fearing arrest following their indictment in @entity163 , did their trafficking careers soar			1
it 's not clear how they first made contact with the @entity167 , but by mid- 2005 they were summoned by @entity22 himself , according to government filings			0
flown to an airstrip in @entity172 , they were taken to a secret mountain compound to hammer out drug deals with the kingpin			2
from 2004 on , prosecutors say , the brothers ran their entire @entity67 operation from a @entity9 ranch , issuing orders by phone			1
their network stretched from @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity45 , to @entity185 and @entity186 , @entity187			0
strict rules governed the drug shipments			2
@entity22 's people got the drugs across the @entity67 - @entity9 border — sometimes via tunnels — and were responsible until the packages were transferred to @entity2 associates in the @entity67 if the drugs were lost somewhere between that point and @entity6 , the brothers would be on the hook for the full cost			1
court documents say the twins approached @entity67 authorities on their own in the summer of 2008 , offering to cooperate			1
the papers do not explain why , though it happened during bloody conflicts between cartels , and the twins may have feared they would soon fall victim			2
still , they continued to do business with the cartel , now with the aim of gathering evidence			0
according to court documents , they met @entity22 again in his mountain compound in october 2008 , when he made an ominous request of @entity2 : could he obtain rocket and grenade launchers ? they would use them , he was told , to attack a @entity67 or @entity9 government office to send the message that cartel suspects were not to be extradited			1
the pressure on the twins was building			0
then something triggered @entity67 agents ' concern			2
on nov. 30 , 2008 , they gave the brothers two hours ' notice to get out of @entity9			1
they flew to @entity6 with little but the clothing they wore			0
but the brothers ' scheming did not stop immediately			0
in @entity6 , the two sought to squirrel away millions in ill - gotten gains , toying with the idea of burying some of the money , filings say			0
while in custody , they also managed to purchase a $ 100,000 @entity244 as a gift for @entity1 's wife			2
they had to give it up when agents learned what they had done .			0
