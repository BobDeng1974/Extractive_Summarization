by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 12:51 est , 12 december 2012 a neglectful mother abandoned her young children for five days to go on a trip to @entity6 seaside , a court heard			1
the four siblings , aged between one and 10 , were left in filthy conditions and forced to fend for themselves while their 30 - year - old single mother went to ' check on hotel prices '			1
the woman was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison , suspended for two years , at @entity14			1
a beach in @entity6 where the mother claimed she had gone to ' check out hotel prices ' the one - year - old baby had a full nappy and all four children were dressed in shabby clothing when police were called to the family home in @entity24 , on july 20 this year			1
their mother , who did not return until july 24 , left them all in the care of their 15 - year - old cousin , with little but beer , butter and milk in the house , heard			1
' a young boy opened the door to police and told them he was alone with his siblings , ' said prosecutor @entity38			2
' the children were dressed in shabby , dirty clothing and were sharing ice cream out of a mug			1
' the youngest child was wearing a dirty vest and had a full nappy			1
' the cupboards were empty apart from beer , butter and milk for the baby			1
' police contacted the mother who insisted she would be back , but she failed to do so while officers were at the house , resulting in the children being taken into police protection , mr @entity38 added			1
the 30 - year - old , who has previously received a caution for child neglect , handed herself in to police			0
' her excuse was that she went there ( to @entity6 ) to check on hotel prices , ' mr @entity38 added			1
she has since been reunited with her children , although their grandmother is now their primary carer			1
sentencing , judge @entity67 said : ' in july this year you took off to @entity6 and did not return until tuesday			0
judge : ' your reasons and excuses for doing so seem lamentable			0
' ' your reasons and excuses for doing so seem lamentable			0
' how you can conceivably leave a 12 - month old baby and a five - year - old with your nephew , together with a ten and eight - year - old , how that household coped until the police arrived , beggars belief			2
' the position now is the children have been reunited with you and your mother is the main carer , by virtue of an agreement with the local authority			1
' nevertheless , you have access to them			0
it would be punishing them further if i was to deprive you of your liberty			0
' this was a very grave case of neglect and one that merits a custodial sentence , that i am prepared to suspend			2
' judge @entity99 also ordered that the woman should be supervised for 18 months and complete 20 sessions of specified activity programme			0
@entity103 , defending , said the mother suffered from depression and struggled to cope with the pressures of parenthood			2
' she is more than aware of the , to put it mildly , unsatisfactory nature of the care			0
' she did make arrangements , she did n't leave on a whim			0
' she collected her nephew and brought him home			0
' her sister and brother - in - law also reside at the address and she expected them to be there throughout the weekend			0
' she expected at least one adult to be in the property to supervise the children			2
' social services are happy for her to reside at the address although she is not their main carer			0
' the mother admitted four counts of child neglect			2
