by @entity0 since drones became mainstream there has been a constant battle between pilots and law enforcement agencies about where the unmanned crafts can fly			2
data analysts from @entity9 have created a map of the @entity11 that plots where owners can pilot their drones , and where specifically the drones are banned			1
the states with the fewest restrictions are revealed as @entity18 in the northwest and @entity20 in the east , while @entity22 and @entity23 have the most			1
explore the drone map below the @entity25 map of the @entity11 ( pictured ) was created by data analysts @entity27 and @entity28			1
it plots where in the @entity11 owners can pilot their drones , and where specifically the drones are banned in the @entity11 , the @entity34 has a blanket ban on drones flying over restricted airspace including national parks , military bases and within a five mile radius of medium and large airports			1
in 2012 , the @entity34 fined a drone owner $ 10,000 for flying his @entity45 drone over the @entity46			0
he was fined because he had used the drone to record photos he later sold to the university			0
the @entity34 said the flight violated regulations that forbid the use of drones in the @entity11 for commercial reasons			2
following an appeal , judge @entity55 overruled the decision claiming the @entity34 has not issued ‘ an enforceable rule governing model aircraft operation			0
’ he added the agency has also ‘ historically exempted model aircraft from the statutory definitions of ‘ aircraft ’ by relegating model aircraft to voluntary compliance with the [ @entity34 ’s 2007 ] guidelines			0
’ it was the first time a fine had been dismissed			0
drones are also banned from being used for commercial reasons			0
analysts @entity27 and @entity28 plotted the location of these bases across the @entity11 , using @entity75 data , the @entity76 and @entity77			1
they then built the map in @entity80			0
by zooming all the way out , the whole of the @entity11 is revealed			2
red areas mark the no - fly zones and show the shape and size of the region they cover			2
zooming in , and hovering a mouse over these red regions show what kind of restricted airspace it covers , it also reveals the name of the location			1
drones have always been restricted above military bases and airports for security reasons , but the restriction above national parks only came into effect at the start of this month			1
the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) outlawed launching , landing , or operating drones on or over federally operated lands and waters			0
it was signed by director @entity107 on 27 june			0
the @entity76 manages all of the country 's national parks , monuments , and various historical sites			1
individual parks had banned drones prior to this agreement , including @entity115 in @entity23 in may			1
mr @entity107 said : ' we embrace many activities in national parks because they enhance visitor experience with the iconic natural , historic and cultural landscapes in our care			1
in the @entity11 , the @entity34 has a blanket ban on drones flying over restricted airspace including national parks , military bases and within a five mile radius of medium and large airports			1
@entity22 and @entity23 ( pictured ) have the most restrictions due to the large number of parks and bases the states with the fewest restrictions are revealed as @entity18 in the northwest ( pictured left ) and @entity20 in the east ( pictured right )			1
analysts mr @entity27 and ms @entity28 plotted the location of these bases across the @entity11 , using @entity75 data , the @entity76 and @entity77			1
they then built the map in @entity80 ' however , we have serious concerns about the negative impact that flying unmanned aircraft is having in parks , so we are prohibiting their use until we can determine the most appropriate policy that will protect park resources and provide all visitors with a rich experience			2
' the hope is that the ban will eliminate many noise and nuisance complaints and help ensure safety			0
in september , rangers in @entity160 captured a drone that flew over the @entity163 amphitheater in @entity164			0
then in april , visitors to the @entity166 complained about noise from a drone that crashed into the canyon			0
red areas ( pictured ) mark the no - fly zones and show the shape and size of the region it covers			2
zooming in , and hovering a mouse over these red regions show what kind of restricted airspace it covers , it also reveals the name of the location drones ( stock image pictured ) have always been restricted above military bases and airports for security reasons , but the restriction above national parks only came into effect at the start of this month			1
the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) outlawed launching , landing , or operating drones on or over federally operated lands and waters ‘ unmanned drones like quadcopters and fixed - wing aircraft are at the centre of new airspace regulations by the @entity34 , ’ explained mr @entity27			2
‘ while the @entity34 deliberates on rules and regulations , states , cities and other national organisations have implemented their own no - fly zones			2
‘ to help people find safe places to fly , we ’ve mapped established no - fly areas where drones are not permitted			0
‘ there are still many uncertainties around where and how one can fly a remotely operated aircraft			0
this map is a just a start			0

do **n’t** @entity25 map of the @entity11 was created by data analysts @entity27 and @entity28
the states with the fewest restrictions include @entity18 in the northwest and @entity20 in the east
@entity22 and @entity23 have the most restrictions due to the large number of national parks and military bases
drones ca **n’t** be flown over restricted airspace including national parks , military bases and within a five mile radius of medium and large airports
hovering the mouse over a red region reveals what kind of airspace the area cover
