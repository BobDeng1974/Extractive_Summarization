@entity0 have left themselves open to further accusations of corruption after insisting their £ 6million report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity5 would not be published			2
@entity7 officials will await an official explanation from the world governing body before issuing a response			0
but @entity12 , who chairs the adjudicatory chamber of @entity0 ’s ethics committee , has reportedly said he would not be allowing the findings of a 350 - page report - compiled from 200,000 pages of evidence by @entity20 attorney @entity19 – to ever be available to the public			1
@entity19 ( left ) is said to be furious that @entity12 ( right ) will not release the report @entity12 says not even the @entity0 executive committee will be able to read the full report when it is finished @entity12 , a judge in @entity25 , has told the @entity26 that he and his deputy would be the only people to read the report and said that @entity0 ’s rules prohibited him from even showing it to @entity0 president @entity32 and the world governing body ’s 27 - man executive			1
it means the accusations of bribery in the bidding process for the @entity40 will remain unanswered ; at least publicly			0

' it confirms what we have long suspected , that all @entity0 is interested in is burying this whole matter and sweeping the evidence under the carpet			2
’ @entity64 poses with @entity32 while he was @entity7 chairman			0
he said the announcement was ' not surprising ' @entity64 , the former @entity7 chairman who initially led the @entity68 bid to host the 2018 @entity40 until his resignation seven months before the vote , said : ‘ @entity0 has a very long - standing culture of misbehaviour and complete secrecy — omerta is the word that comes to my mind — so in a way it ’s not surprising that they wo n’t reveal the contents of the @entity19 report			1
' but the most clear test of whether @entity0 ever attempts to reform is whether it conducts investigations in a transparent way , publishes the details of the findings and deals with the problems in an equally transparent way			0
' other than that , the culture will simply go on as it has done now for decades			0
’ @entity64 suggested that ' the culture will simply go on as it has done now for decades '			0
