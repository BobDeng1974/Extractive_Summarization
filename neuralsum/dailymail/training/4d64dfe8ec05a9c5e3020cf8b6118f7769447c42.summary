by @entity1 showbusiness correspondent prince @entity2 has been compared to the @entity3 and the @entity4 over his calls for the destruction of the royal ivory collection			1
@entity8 , the longest - serving expert on the @entity9 , claimed the @entity11 ’s proposal was no different to dictatorships that eradicate artworks for political or religious reasons			1
@entity2 said he would like the @entity16 ’s 1,200 ivory artefacts to be destroyed to reinforce his message that trade in the tusk material is immoral			1
criticism : prince @entity2 , pictured left wearing the logo of the wildlife foundation @entity23 , received an open letter from antiques expert @entity8 ( right ) saying ridding the @entity16 of its ivory would make little difference but in an open letter to the prince , 71 - year - old mr @entity8 said the items – some more than 200 years old – should be left untouched to help future generations learn about historic societies			1
the @entity34 star , who works for art auctioneers @entity35 and was previously employed by @entity37 , wrote : ‘ your highness , i have nothing but admiration for your principled stance , your obvious love of wildlife in general and of the elephant in particular , but i really do n’t think that destroying the one will preserve the other			2
’ he said earlier societies ’ creations allow us to ‘ build up a picture of their world ’ , adding : ‘ destroying their works of art erases them from the historical record			0
‘ such iconoclasm has not been much admired by succeeding generations … to witness a few : the @entity59 , the @entity3 , @entity60 , the @entity61 , @entity62 and the @entity4			0
’ the letter , published in the @entity64 , added : ‘ i do not think that this wholesale destruction would move the progress of the campaign one iota			0
’ it was primatologist dame @entity70 who last month revealed prince @entity2 had said he would ‘ like to see all the ivory owned by @entity73 destroyed ’			1
illegal : prince @entity75 and prince @entity2 are show items confiscated by customs officers last year much of the @entity78 was presented to the monarchy by foreign countries , but is now held in trust for the nation			1
@entity2 and was at the @entity83 in @entity84 last month , where his father warned the imminent extinction of some species would have ‘ dire consequences for humanity ’			2
prince @entity75 told international leaders the ‘ appalling ’ illegal ivory trade was ‘ annihilating our threatened wildlife ’			2
the @entity78 includes an ivory throne on which @entity96 @entity95 was photographed when she became @entity97 in 1876			0
one of the oldest artefacts is a leather and ivory fan celebrating the recovery of @entity103 from an illness in 1789			2
it was given to @entity95 on her @entity106 in 1887 and presented to @entity108 in 1911			0
there is also an ivory cup decorated with rubies , emeralds and turquoise , bought by @entity114 in 1823			0
legacy : this ivory throne was presented to @entity96 @entity95 in 1851 and displayed at the @entity117 critics point out prince @entity2 ’s plan also threatens a portrait of his own grandmother – a miniature of the @entity96 as a toddler , painted on ivory in 1928			1
renowned art critic @entity125 last night said he agreed with mr @entity8 , adding : ‘ the prince has been very foolish and not thought this through … destroying the ivory in the @entity78 is not going to have any effect at all			1
’ the idea was also condemned by art broker @entity131 who labelled it ‘ bonkers beyond belief ’			0
dr @entity135 and dr @entity136 , who have conducted studies for charities such as @entity139 , suggested previous attempts to suppress the trade by destroying stockpiles have actually driven up the price of tusks .			0

in open letter @entity8 , 71 , said destroying ivory would *n't* save wildlife
@entity2 said @entity16 *'s* 1,200 artefacts should go to send out a message
much of the collection was presented to @entity154 by foreign nations
