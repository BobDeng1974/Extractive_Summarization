by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 17:10 est , 14 december 2012 @entity3 : 17:12 est , 14 december 2012 home operation : @entity5 carried out the procedure on four - week - old baby @entity7 using only a pair of scissors , forceps and olive oil a nurse has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a four - week - old baby who bled to death after a botched home circumcision			1
@entity7 died the day after @entity5 carried out the procedure without anaesthetic , using only a pair of scissors , forceps and olive oil , a trial at @entity23 heard			1
the 67 - year - old is originally from @entity26 , as are the youngster ’s parents , where the circumcision of newborns is a tradition for @entity34 families , the jury heard			1
@entity5 , who is also a midwife , was paid £ 100 for the operation as @entity7 ’s parents were not aware the procedure was available on the @entity38			1
the @entity40 was just a mile and a half from the family home in @entity44 , near @entity45 , but by the time an ambulance was called the infant could not be saved , the court heard			1
a jury of eight women and four men found @entity5 guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence by a majority verdict of 10 to 2 after deliberating for eight hours and 20 minutes			1
@entity54 , specialist prosecutor in the @entity55 , said : ' @entity7 was a healthy little boy whose tragic death was wholly unnecessary			1
' this case was not about the rights or wrongs of circumcision , but the grossly negligent way in which the procedure was undertaken			0
circumcision is a medical procedure which , like any other , carries very real risks to the patient that must be properly managed			0
this was not done in this case			0
' @entity7 died because the standard of care taken by @entity5 in carrying out the circumcision fell far below the standard that should be applied			1
she also failed to inform his parents of the risks and possible complications , which ultimately led to his tragic death			2
' @entity76 was adjourned for the preparation of pre-sentence reports			0
@entity5 , of @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , was granted bail with conditions			2
the court heard how she botched the procedure by leaving a ' ragged ' wound that bled			0
her post-op care was also described as woefully inadequate			0
@entity90 , opening the case for the prosecution , told the jury : ' the allegation essentially here is that the care she provided in the course of that procedure was so bad that not only did it cause the death of that young baby wholly unnecessarily , but it amounted to gross negligence and a crime			1
' the @entity40 was just a mile and a half from the family home in @entity44 , near @entity45 , but by the time an ambulance was called the child could not be saved mr @entity107 said circumcisions were routinely carried out among @entity34 families in @entity26 who brought the tradition with them to the @entity111 , and the procedure was an ' ancient , well established and widespread ' practice across the world			1
but the court heard that up to three children a month are admitted to the @entity117 due to bleeding after home - based circumcisions - a danger the nurse should have been aware of			1
@entity7 was born on march 22 , 2010 , in @entity122 and died on april 17 , the day after the circumcision , aged 27 days			1
@entity5 was introduced to the family through a friend as she had performed many circumcisions over the years and offered her ' experience and skill '			2
around 5pm on april 16 , @entity7 ’s father , @entity129 , brought @entity5 by car to the family home — and the nurse sent him immediately to get some @entity133 while she and the mother , @entity134 , prepared for the operation			1
once inside , @entity5 told the boy ’s mother to fetch some olive oil and a bowl of warm water and the child was stripped to just his vest			1
@entity5 then brought her ' instruments ' out of her handbag and dipped a pair of scissors into the water in a kidney dish			2
nurse : @entity5 was introduced to @entity7 's family through a friend as she had performed many circumcisions before ' at that point @entity134 closed her eyes , ' mr @entity107 said			1
' @entity7 had had no anaesthetic or local pain relief at this point and that is not how this should be done			2
' by the time @entity134 opened her eyes the operation was over			2
she could see the foreskin between the blades of the scissors			0
' @entity5 then cleaned the wound with cotton wool and applied a bandage			2
the boy was ' crying throughout ' and the wound was bleeding , but @entity5 told the mother this was normal , the court heard			2
the defendant left the house between 30 and 40 minutes after surgery and the £ 100 had been handed over , without any proper checks on the patient after the procedure , it was alleged			1
the parents later found the bandage had come off the wound , which was dripping with blood			0
mr @entity107 said even a small amount of blood loss is dangerous and the loss of just one sixth of a pint of blood can be fatal for a newborn			0
the concerned parents , who had no medical training , called the defendant around two and a half hours later			0
@entity5 told them the bleeding was normal and ' not a problem ' and advised a change of nappy and bandage and to apply olive oil			1
in fact @entity5 should have advised immediate medical attention			2
' to delay and reassure was simply not appropriate , ' the prosecutor told the jury			0
' his parents remained concerned but they had been reassured by the defendant			0
' however , the following morning it was clear something was wrong and at 7.20am an ambulance was called			0
mr @entity107 added : ' i have no doubt there will be much criticism of the parents by their inaction			0
' but can i invite you to consider this			0
one of the hardest things as a parent , especially parents of a young child , is knowing when to be worried and how worried to be			0
' but on the other hand no one wants to make a fuss about nothing			0
' a post-mortem examination found @entity7 died from blood loss after the op. mr @entity107 said : ' his death was wholly unnecessary			1
he bled to death over a period of many hours when medical assistance , which could have saved his life , was minutes away			0

@entity7 died at family home in @entity44 following operation
nurse @entity5 found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence
67 - year - old , originally from @entity26 , also worked as a midwife
paid £ 100 for the operation involving only scissors , forceps and olive oil
@entity55 says death of ' healthy little boy ' was ' wholly unnecessary '
