people could someday be living the high life in this futuristic ' super city ' towering 2,230ft into the clouds			0
the @entity5 project , a 1.7 million square foot metropolis , dwarfs all but one skyscraper in the world - the 2,717ft ( 828 metres ) @entity9			0
it was designed as part of a competition to create a new iconic business district in @entity14 , @entity15 - and the towering design won first prize			1
the high - life : people in @entity14 , @entity15 could someday be living the high life in this futuristic urban community towering 2230ft ( 680 metres ) into the clouds			2
the concept building was designed as part of a competition to create a new iconic business district , scooping first prize the ultra-modern building would use solar and wind power , as well as harvest rainwater , making it efficient for the community			1
@entity31 - based @entity30 and cr - design in @entity14 collaborated with @entity33 in @entity34 on the concept			1
the idea behind the competition was to create an iconic new business district , similar to @entity40 ’s @entity39 or @entity41 in @entity42			1
however , unlike those business districts , cloud citizen is made up of one , huge integrated building			1

however , unlike those business districts , cloud citizen is made up of one , huge integrated building it took a dedicated team of designers around 12 weeks of work to create the plans			1
the design aims to give back to the environment through rainwater harvesting , solar and wind power , and pollutant filters			1
a number of smaller areas within the large structure have been set aside for it - industry , commercial , leisure , and cultural areas			1
each one of these spaces is also connected to a large park , and aims to encourage a sustainable lifestyles			0
@entity80 , international design director for the @entity30 , said their vision was less about grandeur and more focused on giving back to the environment			2
raising expectations : unlike other business districts , @entity87 concept is made up of one , huge integrated building			2
it took a dedicated team of designers around 12 weeks of work to create the plans superstructure : the design aims to give back to the environment through rainwater harvesting , solar and wind power , and pollutant filters			1
a number of smaller areas within the large structure have been set aside for it - industry , commercial , leisure , and cultural areas in the clouds : @entity80 , international design director for the @entity30 , said their vision was less about grandeur and more focused on giving back to the environment ' we were interested in the old @entity115 low - rise courtyard blocks , called @entity116 , and wanted to see if we could use the informal village arrangements of these in a @entity118 setting for increased social interaction , ' he said			1
' our partner , @entity121 , is based in @entity14 and that 's why we decided to work on this project together			2
' @entity14 is changing from manufacturing to service industries , which has been tremendously fast - paced already			0
' the point was to create a project with the capacity to give more to the environment than it takes			0
' we not only tried to create a meaningful public space in the sky , but we also worked on water harvesting , sky gardens and micro generation , for example			0
' inspiration : ' we were interested in the old @entity115 low - rise courtyard blocks , called @entity138 , and wanted to see if we could use the informal village arrangements of these in a @entity118 setting for increased social interaction , ' said the designer , @entity80 construction : ' the point was to create a project with the capacity to give more to the environment than it takes , ' said @entity80 , international design director			2
' we not only tried to create a meaningful public space in the sky , but we also work on water harvesting , sky gardens and micro generation , for example ' while the designs are still a concept , they could someday be built in @entity14 , a major city in the south of @entity15 's @entity156 , situated immediately north of @entity31 ( pictured ) a @entity40 - based architect has been making waves in the design industry with her vision of a stunning home powered by @entity163 's concept , @entity164 , aims to harness the consistent and powerful movement of waves to generate energy a @entity40 - based architect has been making waves in the design industry with her vision of a stunning home powered by hydroelectricity			1
@entity175 's concept , @entity164 , aims to harness the consistent and powerful movement of waves to generate energy			0
ms @entity175 is an avid supporter of renewable energy - previously designing an electric coral reef station and a hydroelectric prison			0
she explained that the construction will be focused around two shells - one inner and one outer			0
made of concrete , the outer shell is designed to keep the house stable and will use solar cells to generate energy for the living section			0
the inner section , which will be made of aluminium , will move in cohesion with the tide			0
the section will float within the external structure as the tide rushes through it			0
as tides are more predictable than solar energy , ms @entity175 has included a two - part turbine , which , reacting with waves , will compress air to create an electrical current - similar to a wind turbine			2
the second part of the turbine uses magnets that move along a copper wire , also generating electrical energy .			0

cloud citizen project , was designed by @entity30 , @entity209 - design and @entity33
the building would use solar and wind power , as well as harvest rainwater , making it efficient for a large community
huge structure won first prize in a competition to create a new iconic business district in @entity14 , @entity15
smaller areas within the large structure have been set aside for it - industry , commercial , leisure , and cultural areas
