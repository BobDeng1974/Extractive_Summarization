by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:24 est , 27 february 2014 two police officers who spent weeks competing to see who could take the most cardboard signs away from homeless people have escaped with just a three day suspension for the cruel prank			1
the action was finally taken nearly two months after the @entity10 learned of the ' game ' , according to findings of the internal affairs investigation obtained by @entity0 through a public records request			1
advocate groups immediately blasted the department 's handling , suggesting that the punishment was n't harsh enough and that the probe should have been made public much earlier , before news organizations started asking about it			2
taking from the poor : two police officers in @entity24 , @entity25 were briefly suspended for playing a game in which they confiscated signs from homeless people			1
above , one of the stolen signs ' the fact that they are making sport out of collecting the personal property of homeless individuals could be seen as them targeting these individuals for discriminatory harassment , ' said @entity39 , an attorney in the @entity41 office of the @entity42			2
' simply holding a sign is absolutely a protected part of our free speech			0
' police chief @entity47 said the actions were an isolated incident in a department of 186 officers and did n't deserve a harsher punishment			1
after the investigation all officers were reminded to respect individual rights and human dignity , he said			0
' we want to respect people , no matter who they are â € ” homeless , whatever , ' @entity47 said			0
' that situation 's been dealt with			0
' the investigation found the two officers , @entity64 and @entity65 , violated the department 's professional standards of conduct			1
there is no law against panhandling in @entity24 , an oil - boom city of more than 110,000 where a recent count put the homeless number at about 300			1
about a quarter of those are transient			0
' i think i was set up ' : a text message conversation obtained by the @entity0 shows the police officers talking about the game after getting caught by their superiors in the department @entity83 , founder of @entity24 's ministry , said the failure by police to disclose the officers ' behavior once discovered made it appear the department was ' pushing it under the carpet			1
' i think that does give the public the wrong message , ' he said			0
asked wednesday about why the investigation was n't made public earlier , city spokeswoman @entity95 said it is not the department 's standard protocol to announce when an internal affairs investigation is completed			2
she said the officers were n't suspended until january because of staffing issues and the winter holidays			2
on a recent afternoon , one group of homeless people could be seen near a trash bin behind a fast - food restaurant and another around an intersection			0
among their signs was one that read : ' anything helps			0
' no right : @entity24 police officers @entity64 and @entity65 confiscated the signs even though panhandling is n't against the law @entity24			1
above , a homeless woman named @entity122 in @entity24 targeted : the homeless population in @entity24 is about 300 , a quarter of whom are transient			2
from left , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 take a break from panhandling on february 24 ' if it was them , i guarantee you they 'd be doing the same thing , ' said @entity127 , who sought donations on a street corner while eating from a package of beef jerky			0
' i think they 're bored			0
' the two officers , who did not appeal their suspensions , have been with the department about two years			1
they both returned emails from the @entity0 declining to be interviewed			0
according to the investigation report , eight signs were found in the trunk of @entity150 's patrol car on nov. 20 and @entity65 had thrown the about 10 signs he had confiscated into a city trash container after @entity150 called him to warn him he had been reprimanded by his superior for having the signs			1
the two told the internal affairs investigator , that they were issuing criminal trespass warnings when they took the signs			0
but according to the report , no homeless people were issued criminal trespass warnings by either officer in 2013			0
most of those warnings in @entity24 are written , but some are verbal			2
some punishment : the two officers were put on suspension for three days without pay two months after the department found out about the game			1
above , another of the confiscated signs desperate : homeless man @entity126 holds up a sign while asking motorists for donations in @entity24 , @entity25 on february 24 the investigation also looked into complaints from within the department that @entity150 and @entity65 failed to log into evidence brass knuckles , a small set of scales and two knives they had obtained during other patrol stops			1
the investigation into the signs began after an officer on patrol with @entity150 when @entity150 obtained the brass knuckles sent an email to his sergeant nov. 18 about @entity150 saying he was n't going to log them in as evidence			1
the signs and the brass knuckles were found in @entity150 's car during a vehicle inspection two days later			1
the contest between @entity150 , 25 , and @entity65 , 26 , was alluded to in text messages on november 21 obtained by the @entity0 it was unclear which of the officers sent each message			1
' my bad man when he first ask me about it he did n't seem mad or anything so i just told him me and u wereaking ( sic ) a game outta it when we 'd trespass them and stuff , ' one text read			0
another read , ' man this is some bs			0
' although @entity83 said he does n't believe the officers ' actions reflect on the whole department , he considered the penalty insufficient			2
' i do n't believe three days gives it justice , ' @entity83 said .			0

@entity24 police officers @entity64 , 25 , and @entity65 , 26 , were suspended for three days without pay two months after being found out
the department found out about the game from another police officer who reported @entity150 not logging confiscated brass knuckles
when they went to search @entity150 's *squad* car , the found the brass knuckles and the confiscated signs
the two officers , who have been with the department for about 2 years , stole the signs even though panhandling is legal
