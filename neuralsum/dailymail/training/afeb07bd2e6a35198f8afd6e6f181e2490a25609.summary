by @entity0 published : 03:22 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 05:02 est , 8 june 2012 a groundbreaking vaccine that could cut cases of @entity4 's disease by half has been discovered			2
the jab developed by scientists in @entity8 could delay the onset of the debilitating illness and be the first step towards finding a cure			2
@entity4 's is the most common form of dementia and attacks nerves , brain cells and neurotransmitters that carry messages to and from the brain			1
new hope : the jab could delay the onset of the debilitating illness and be the first step towards finding a cure ( picture posed by model ) the vaccine , known as @entity27 , helps patients create protective antibodies to defend against deposits that develop in the brain of sufferers			1
researchers from @entity34 in @entity8 and from the @entity8 @entity35 claimed in the @entity37 journal that their discovery could help people with mild to moderate versions of @entity4 's			1
they found no serious side effects during the tests , which took place over three years on people aged between 50 and 80			1
one in 14 people over 65 years old is affected by the disease , according to the @entity47			1
the risks increase with age , with around one in six people over 80 years old developing the condition			1
scientists hope @entity54 can delay the onset of @entity4 ’s disease by five years			2
campaigner : sci - fi author @entity58 suffers from @entity4 's and has fronted tv documentaries on the subject according to the @entity63 , dementia is currently the fastest growing global health epidemic			1
in the @entity66 , 820,000 people have a form of dementia with more than half suffering from @entity4 ’s			1
the figure is set to rise to a million in less than 10 years			2
@entity4 's may be caused by a ' perfect storm ' of minor gene alterations , new research shows			0
a number of inactive or over-active genes - rather than individual severe mutations - may be the origin of neurodegenerative disorders , according to a report in journal @entity79			0
every healthy person has gene varients which express themselves in slightly different ways			0
on their own they have a modest effect , but taken together can lead to problems , said dr @entity88 , of @entity90 's @entity89			0
she added : ' if we can identify the genes linked to a disease that are too active or too dormant , we might be able to define new drug targets and therapies			0
' dr @entity96 , @entity97 at @entity98 , said : ' already half a million people in the @entity66 are living with @entity4 ’s disease , and we urgently need new treatments that can offer hope for the future			1
' for the best chance of success , we need to see many more treatments being trialled in this way , and that means a huge investment in research			0
' long - term , larger scale trials of @entity54 will determine whether it can help people ’s memory and thinking skills , as well as reducing the amount of amyloid in the brain			2
' amyloid begins to build in the brain long before symptoms of @entity4 ’s appear , and it ’s likely that any new treatment will be most effective when given in the early stages of the disease			0
' the researchers found 74 per cent of the people taking @entity54 had increased levels of antibodies in their blood after having the vaccine , suggesting that the vaccine had triggered their immunity			1
the authors called it a ' promising option in the treatment of mild - to - moderate alzheimer ’s disease			0
' in an accompanying article , @entity138 from the @entity139 wrote : ' development of an immunotherapy that can delay @entity4 onset by five years would reduce the prevalence of the disease by half			0
' this new vaccine comes as a promising addition to what will probably be a long road to the ultimate successful immunotherapy			0

@entity153 creates antibodies and has few side effects
dementia affects 820,000 people in the @entity66
