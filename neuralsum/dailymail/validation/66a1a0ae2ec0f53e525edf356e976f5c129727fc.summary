you can search far and wide for the answer to a problem , but sometimes it is right under your nose			0
when @entity6 sent @entity7 on loan to @entity9 in november it looked to be the final nail in the @entity13 's @entity12 career			1
the @entity15 manager admitted as much recently , revealing he was prepared to let the midfielder leave in december			0
@entity12 midfielder @entity7 ( right ) controls the ball during his side 's win against @entity20 the @entity13 wore a protective mask at @entity22 after fracturing his nose against @entity24 @entity7 , pictured challenging @entity25 , has become the @entity15 ' midfield enforcer in recent months but a spate of injuries in midfield saw @entity6 recall @entity7 in december			1
the 23 - year - old has n't looked back			0
he 's grasped his chance to become a key member of @entity12 's midfield with both hands , despite his reluctance to return to @entity12 from @entity9 fearing he 'd simply be warming the bench			1
there 's an argument to suggest he 's the most vital component in @entity6 's plans at the present moment ; the central midfield enforcer they 've been crying out for in recent years			2
just weeks after his @entity12 career looked to be drawing to a close , @entity7 is on the verge of agreeing a new long - term contract to stay at the @entity49			1
@entity6 would like to say @entity7 's emergence has been pre-planned ; a managerial masterstroke that has helped @entity12 turn their stuttering league form around			1
but that is far from the case			0
@entity7 played five games on loan at @entity9 this season but has returned to be a first team regular @entity7 's stint in the first team has earned him a new long - term contract with the @entity15 the @entity13 midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot @entity64 in the pecking order following three substitute appearances after his return from the @entity68 , @entity7 was handed a rare start against @entity70 on december 28 in place of the injured @entity64			1
he has n't looked back			0
his energetic and mature displays alongside @entity73 in central midfield have been a revelation - none more so than in the win at @entity77 in january			0
the concern with @entity7 has always been about his physical stature			0
can his slender frame handle the rough and tumble of @entity83 football ? he 's answered those questions unequivocally in recent weeks			0
having fractured his nose in the recent win over @entity24 , the midfielder insisted upon playing on - only coming off in injury time after taking another blow to the face			0
three days later he was back on the pitch , sporting a protective mask , in the narrow win over @entity20 at @entity22			0
he 's waited so long to prove himself in an @entity12 shirt , @entity7 's wo n't let a broken nose keep him on the sidelines now			1
@entity15 boss @entity6 admitted that he was willing to let @entity7 leave the club before his return @entity6 is still interested in @entity100 's defensive midfielder @entity99 ( left ) @entity7 , pictured in training , still needs to convince @entity6 that he can play for @entity12 long - term the big question is whether @entity7 is the long - term answer to @entity6 's holding midfielder conundrum			1
after failing to sign an enforcer last summer , the @entity15 will be back in the market for a midfield ball winner once more at the end of the season despite @entity7 's emergence			2
@entity99 , for the time being , is favourite to land the role provided @entity12 can strike a deal with @entity100 , who will want at least Â£ 25milliom			1
that would leave @entity7 's regular place in @entity6 's team selections under threat			1
for now @entity7 will be focusing on keeping his place in the team until the end of the season			2
the returns of @entity123 and @entity124 following injury spells will cast further questions over the @entity13 's role			2
but , for now , the shirt is @entity7 's to lose			2
having waited so long for this chance - he 'll be desperate to keep it that way .			0

@entity12 were set to release @entity7 this summer
but he is now on the verge of signing a long - term contract at @entity12
the @entity13 has impressed since returning from a loan at @entity9
@entity6 remains interested in @entity100 's @entity99
@entity7 must prove he can keep his place at @entity12 for years to come
