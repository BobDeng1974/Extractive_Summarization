he was then released to be booked on suspicion of felony evading , theft of a horse , possession of stolen property and reckless driving			2
after the video was broadcast by @entity11 , it sparked outrage on the @entity181 , with many users noting that @entity8 was lying on the ground in a ' surrender ' position when he was beaten by the officers			1
on friday , mr @entity51 told @entity186 that the attack seemed never - ending			0
' this is as bad , if not worse , than what they did to @entity191			1
it kept going and going and going , ' he said			0
@entity191 , who died in 2012 , rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by @entity198 officers following a high - speed car chase in march 1991			1
although four officers were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force , they were later acquitted in a series of verdicts that are thought to have caused the 1992 @entity119 riots			2
' surrendering ' : the suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back			0
the video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch huddled around : as more officers join in , the men huddle in a pack over @entity8 , continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head			1
meanwhile , one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle			0
also friday , @entity55 said an internal investigation is underway into the deputies ' actions in the arrest of @entity8			1
a criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out , he said			0
however , he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid			0
' i 'm asking for some patience while we complete a thorough and fair investigation , ' @entity55 said			0
' i am disturbed and troubled by what i see in the video			0
it does not appear to be in line with our policies and procedures			0
hospitalized : @entity8 ( pictured ) was treated at a nearby hospital for abrasions and bruising ' i assure you , if there is criminal doing on the part of any of our deputy sheriffs or any policy violations we will take action			2
' the deputies were wearing audio recorders , but @entity55 said he had not listened to them and the recordings will be part of the investigation			0
attorneys for @entity8 told @entity270 friday as they left the jail that their client has a badly swollen eye , marks from the beating over his face and body , and is in pain			2
' he remembers being beat , and he remembers that he was n't resisting , that he laid still , he complied immediately			0
he says that he did n't even move a muscle because he did n't want to be continuously beat , yet it still happened , ' said attorney @entity280			0
@entity281 , a use of force expert , said the deputies were clearly frustrated and appeared to take that out on the suspect			0
one , he said , appeared to be striking @entity8 with the taser			2
' it does n't look good			0
it looks like his hands are behind his back even when they 're doing the blows , ' @entity281 said			0
' the justification for using force is to gain compliance from the suspect , and the suspect seems to be complying			0
so what this looks like is those blows are not justified , they 're not necessary and they 're not professional			0
' @entity281 said the officers should be disciplined , retrained to deal with stress especially , and the video should be used for department - wide training			2
he said the officers allowed their emotions and adrenaline to overtake their professionalism			0
but training helps ' inoculate ' officers from responding improperly during high - stress situations			0
' when chasing a fleeing suspect , in high stress , you have to control that			0
it 's your obligation as a professional			0
you can lose it sometimes , ' @entity281 said			0
@entity55 said deputies had previously been called to @entity8 's home in @entity118 , where he had allegedly made threats to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of family members			1
' we were very familiar with his aggressive nature , ' @entity55 said			0
comparison : on friday , @entity8 's attorney , @entity51 , told @entity186 that the attack was ' as bad , if not worse , than what they did to @entity191 '			1
@entity191 ( left , after his beating ) rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by @entity198 officers ( right ) following a high - speed car chase in march 1991 @entity8 's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines , including the killing of @entity346 in @entity347 , @entity348 , last weekend			1
@entity346 , 50 , who was unarmed , was shot dead by 33 - year - old officer @entity349 he ran away from him during a traffic stop			0
@entity349 has since been arrested and charged with murder			0
@entity8 's girlfriend of 13 years , @entity107 , said her long - term boyfriend has had several run - ins with the law			1
however , she insisted that he is a great father who did not deserve the brutal beating			0
' i 'm not going to stand here and say that he 's perfect , because who is ? ' she said			0
' i could n't believe it , ' @entity107 said after seeing the video			2
' the first thing i said was ' they can not do that			0
