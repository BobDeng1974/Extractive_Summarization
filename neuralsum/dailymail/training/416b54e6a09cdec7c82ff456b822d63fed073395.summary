but delve below the surface and beyond the military detritus and you will soon discover a subterranean wonderland			0
ambitious @entity13 spent 12 years converting the bunker into the place he now calls home			2
the former schoolteacher purchased the 37 acre site in 1983 for $ 48,000 , converting one third of the 18,000 square feet silo into a living space for his family			1
when he initially drove out to investigate the area , near his hometown of @entity42 , @entity8 , most of the concrete tunnel labyrinth was flooded with rainwater			2
not put off by what lay below him , mr @entity13 undressed to his shorts , climbed below ground level using a rope ladder and swam in between the different chambers			2

every home should have one , right ? ' a 47 ton door would open and they could back a large semi truck in here with a missile , and then the missile that was lying horizontal here would be drawn upward , erected , and then it would be fueled , ready for launch			0
' the missile was over seven stories tall and ten times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on @entity97			0
' this silo was rated to withstand a single mega ton air burst about a mile from the structure , mr @entity13 said			2
' we do n't feel very worried about tornadoes			0
there 's probably 10 , 15 feet of earth over us here			0
