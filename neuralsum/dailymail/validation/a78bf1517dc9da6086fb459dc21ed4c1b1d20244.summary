look out for @entity1 apes , grins our guide : ' we often get raided , especially in the harvest			1
' @entity5 , aged 72 , finds most things funny			1
he owns a donkey called ' @entity8 ' and tells us that most of his neighbours will live to 105			1
our week in the @entity10 , a mountainous region of @entity11 , follows this pattern - it is full of surprises			1
the tops of the mountains are dusted with snow , and yet , around the bottom , you can buy oranges as big as a baby 's head			1
a rif you 'll want to hear forever : the @entity10 mountains are a beautiful - yet less known - part of @entity11 on @entity5 's country walks we see mountain women wearing wide - brimmed hats festooned with pom - poms			1
one minute we 're clambering through gorgeous terraces of onions and fruit , the next we 're in a paddock of cannabis ( or kif )			2
' just for the farmers , ' says @entity5 airily			2
' the long - haired ones do n't come any more			1
' but strangest of all is our first town , @entity40			2
the old parts are all a bluey - purple , as if the entire medina has been flushed with ink			1
to my daughter @entity45 , aged ten , this is enchanting , and we tour every alley and knobbly passage , poking our heads into all the old caravanserais			2
there are no cars in this beautiful labyrinth of mauve , and in the mornings everyone rushes out to the public taps			2
we stay at the @entity58 , a little bit of the 21st century dropped in among these dreamy scenes			2
it even has a modest swimming pool , in a town where most people think a traffic jam has hooves			2
this is not a place for ordinary shopping			1
we somehow end up with an old pair of slave 's manacles ( £ 7 ) , a large flag ( £ 6 ) and a very battered silver headdress ( £ 30 )			2
most of the time it is enough just to wander			2
from the kasbah ( or citadel ) we can peer down into people 's lives			0
as the day warms , housewives head out to the stream to rinse out their carpets			0
after a few days , we head north			1
country and city : a woman from the @entity87 in traditional dress ( left ) ; the back streets of @entity90 ( right ) the @entity10 may not be @entity11 's tallest range , but it 's thrillingly wild			1
great rivers burst through the boulders , and we can just make out tiny villages perched high up in the valley walls			0
then , suddenly , we tumble out into @entity90			1
this fabulous antique city feels only half - african			1
for a long time , it was ' @entity100 ' ( 1923 - 1956 ) , and @entity101 appeared in droves			1
they left cafes , cannon , art deco , a long corniche and a whole cemetery of kind hearts and baronets			0
some came for the view , and we tour the celebrity roosts			0
there 's still a piano bar at @entity115 ( @entity116 and @entity117 ) , although the @entity118 ( @entity119 ) now has palm trees growing through the roof			0
meanwhile , at @entity123 , you can visit @entity125 's bedroom ( number 35 ) and gaze out at the scenes he painted			0
others came to misbehave , particularly the beat poets			0
it 's fun trying to find their old haunts around the medina			0
although @entity134 was wreathed in dust and padlocks , you can still get a whiff of the @entity138 at @entity139			0
however , for @entity45 , the best moments are when we head for the souk			0
one stall sells huge blocks of nougat ( which have to be chopped with a cleaver ) ; another has only magic charms and musket balls			0
captivating : @entity90 - with its medina to the forefront - has long tempted @entity101 travellers to @entity11 deep in the medina , little alleyways turn into grand @entity158 palaces ( like @entity159 ) , or perhaps the house of @entity161 , once the richest woman in the world			1
my favourite is the old @entity167 legation of 1821			0
from the outside , it looks typically dusty and medieval , but step inside and a glorious @entity172 residence appears			0
such excitement requires a cosy bolthole , and we have @entity176			0
hidden in the ramparts , this tiny hotel has been lovingly restored			0
there are log fires and almond cake for tea , and time seems to have paused at 1956			0
enjoy this mad city , walk everywhere , do everything and then retreat to the hotel 's roof			1
in one direction lies @entity189 ( only eight miles away , across the @entity190 ) and in the other lies the @entity10 , now looking pink and mysterious and deceptively tame			1
@entity191 ( 01993 838 420 , www.audleytravel.com ) offers a ten - night private tour of @entity193 , @entity40 , @entity90 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 , from £ 1,850 per person ( two sharing ) including flights			1
@entity198 is the winner of the @entity200 2012 , with @entity201 : travels on @entity204 's @entity203 ( profile £ 8.99 ) .			0

the @entity10 mountains of @entity11 are a splendid place for a quiet escape
the range rises in the north of the country - and yet is relatively unknown
the peaks are also close to the *swirling* city of @entity90 , with its rich *history*
