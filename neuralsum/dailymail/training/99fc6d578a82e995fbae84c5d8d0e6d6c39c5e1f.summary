@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 ... four great on - screen love stories of our time			0
and each completely platonic because all the men in question are gay			0
but these four fictional pairings between straight women and homosexual men might actually represent the most natural , mutually - beneficial , rewarding , helpful and equal human relationship that can be achieved , according to scientific research			1
especially when it comes to finding a romantic partner			0
characterised by a lack of both competition and ulterior motives in terms of searching for a sexual partner or giving advice , the gay - man - straight - woman relationship is win - win , say psychologists at @entity28 , who published their study in @entity31			1
@entity0 title stars @entity33 and @entity34 , left , and their friends @entity2 and @entity1 , played by @entity36 and @entity37 , right author @entity38 and his colleagues claim the age - old unique relationship between the homosexual male and the heterosexual female serves a ' biologically adaptive function '			0
they say : ' because straight women 's relationships with straight men and other straight women are often tainted by deceptive motives related to mating interest or competition , respectively , we predicted that straight women would perceive mating - relevant information provided by a gay male to be more trustworthy than similar advice provided by a straight male or straight female			1
' similarly , ' the sexual interest and competitive motives that may taint gay men 's friendships with each other are notably absent from their relationships with straight women ' , said @entity65 , reporting the study			1
the teamcarried out two experiments with participants during the study , exploring ' a potential benefit hypothesized to be uniquely available to straight women and gay men in the context of these friendships : trustworthy mating advice '			1
the relationship between straight women and gay men - as seen in sitcom @entity0 between both @entity0 , centre , and @entity2 and @entity1 , ends - is mutually - beneficial experiment one revealed straight women perceive mating advice from gay men as more trustworthy than similar advice offered by a straight man or woman			2
experiment two demonstrated that gay men perceive mating advice offered by a straight woman to be more trustworthy than advice offered by a lesbian woman or another gay man			0
the results provide initial experimental evidence that relationships between gay men and straight women may be characterized by a mutual exchange of mating - relevant benefits in the absence of romantic interest or competition			2
