horrific photographs have emerged of a surfer who was left with staples in his head after he was speared by an out - of - control board when he tried to catch a wave			1
the photograph , which shows a bloody head with deep scars , has raised concerns and the dangers that could put lives at risk among the surfing community			0
the man , who refused to provide his name , went for a swim at one of @entity19 's @entity18 when he was speared in the head by a ' runaway long - board ' on thursday morning			1
@entity25 surf website @entity23 editor @entity22 , who reported the incident , told @entity27 it was only a matter of time before a disaster strikes			1
the unnamed man went for a swim at one of @entity19 's @entity18 when he was speared in the head ' these incidents come around a couple of times a year and it 's met with the same reaction , ' mr @entity22 said			1
' it 's the same reaction time and time again and it 's a disbelief that people continue to not wear leg - ropes - it 's not getting any closer to a solution to convince everyone to wear one			1
' when the same encounter happened to him , mr @entity22 said he was outraged and soon felt motivated to pledge for a law in a bid to ban surfers who avoid using the leg - rope from the water			1
' i have met with a feller from @entity53 and @entity54 but he told me it was an extreme case that 's impossible to sue because there 's no legislation for it , ' he said			2
' unless it 's shown and proven in court that the incident was done deliberately but either that - it 's not possible			2
' it 's a simple issue that could be fixed - i understand that surfers just want to retain that freedom where they do n't wear leg - ropes but it would be good if a majority of them start acting responsibly			1
' just remember that you 're not alone out there in the surf and it 's easy to lose your board - and that could seriously hurt someone			2
' the incident comes after @entity79 was smashed in the head with a wooden board last year ( pictured ) the incident comes three months after a @entity83 surfer was smashed in the head with a wooden 's 1960 's - style @entity86 surfboard when a swimmer refused to wear a leg rope in the water			2
@entity79 was swimming with his children and some friends at @entity93 in october last year when he noticed a long board flying at him ' like a missile '			0
' i noticed the board coming at me like a missile when the guy fell off with no leg rope , ' the 41 - year - old told @entity27			0
' i tried to dodge it and i could have potentially got out of the way if i dived down but the water was too shallow			0
' those old school boards are very heavy and big and they could seriously cause death			0
' i 'm not being a grumpy old man but a classic example is â€“ if my head was one of my kids or someone else 's son or daughter , the outcome would be a lot different			0
' the one that hit me had a reasonable size fin on it and it took a chunk out of my head			0
' the father of two was dragged back to shore by his nine - year - old son @entity124 and was bandaged on the spot by his friend before getting 23 stitches at the hospital .			0
