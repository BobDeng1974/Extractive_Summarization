@entity0 cut the gap on @entity3 leaders @entity4 to three points but it came at a huge cost with star striker @entity7 limping off in tears after sustaining a potentially - serious knee injury near the start of the game			1
@entity7 received sympathetic applause from stunned @entity0 fans as he sadly made his way around the edge of the pitch to the dressing - room after receiving nearly five minutes of treatment			1
his eyes were clearly watery both because of the pain and also the prospect of missing wednesday night 's vital @entity23 clash away to @entity24 that will help define @entity0 's season			1

@entity82 : 45,603 referee : @entity84 5 @entity85 man : @entity53 ratings by @entity87 at the @entity88 click here for all the stats and heat maps from the @entity88 including @entity0 midfielder @entity53 's in a man - of - the - match display ( above ) though @entity0 rallied to win the game with a hotly - disputed @entity28 penalty midway through the first half , manager @entity26 and the club 's supporters will be this morning be hugely concerned by the injury to their 19 - goal striker , particularly with the club needing a result in @entity103 to progress to the last 16 in @entity104			1
they were without captain @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 on saturday while @entity55 had his first 30 minutes action for a month following a calf injury			0
@entity28 is also suspended for another two @entity23 matches			2
@entity26 confirmed : ' @entity7 has a problem with his ligament in his knee			1
it is impossible to know now how long he will be out for but we may know on sunday			0
but probably he will miss the game with @entity24 , it is very difficult to recover from a ligament problem in three days			0
' @entity37 's @entity73 fires his free - kick over the wall - and over the bar - as he tries to get @entity37 back in the game @entity71 looks to beat @entity48 as @entity37 go in search of an equalizer @entity7 , who had scored a hat - trick on his previous appearance at the @entity88 against @entity128 , suffered his injury as he was caught by @entity37 midfielder @entity130 while clambering to his feet at an awkward angle after being clattered from behind by @entity71			1
there were just 75 seconds on the clock			0
the 26 - year - old is not noted for histrionics so as he lay on the pitch in clear agony disconsolately clutching his left knee , you knew it was serious enough for him to have to depart the action			2
mindful that @entity7 's natural replacement @entity55 had n't himself played since november 8 because of a calf injury , @entity26 instead sent on 18 - year - old @entity54 for his third appearance as a substitute in @entity0 's first - team , saving the @entity148 for the last half - hour			1
@entity51 slides in for a crunching tackle on @entity72 @entity28 fights for the ball with @entity64 for the ball as @entity0 and @entity37 battle it out at the @entity88 @entity53 passes the ball under pressure from @entity65 @entity154 miles @entity0 112.8 70.1 @entity52 90 12.7 7.9 @entity53 90 11.5 7.2 @entity28 90 11.2 7.0 @entity37 112.3 69.8 @entity70 90 12.4 7.7 @entity71 90 11.9 7.4 @entity73 88 10.8 6.7 given all the injury problems , @entity26 was delighted with his side 's fighting spirit that helped them take advantage of leaders @entity4 's slip - up at @entity162 earlier in the day			1
' it is not easy to beat a team like @entity37 when you have so many important players not there , ' he said			0
the visitors would counter that the champions also received a big helping hand from referee @entity84			0
@entity37 manager @entity171 thought two @entity0 players @entity47 and @entity51 should both have been sent off for high boots , @entity47 catching @entity72 in the back with a kung - fu style kick and @entity51 making contact with @entity70 's head			1
he was also fuming at the key penalty decision after 24 minutes when @entity52 tumbled as @entity65 ran across which was ruled a deliberate barge by mr @entity84 but a legitimate shoulder - to - shoulder challenge by @entity171			0
' it is part of the game , @entity52 was not even asking for a penalty			2
to say i am disappointed is an understatement , ' said @entity171			0
the visitors surrounded mr @entity84 but @entity0 's captain - for - the day @entity28 struck the ball cleanly past @entity36 even though the @entity37 ' keeper correctly dived to his right			1
from then onwards , it was sheer guts and determination that saw @entity0 through			2
@entity52 has a shot on goal as @entity0 looked to extend their lead over @entity37 @entity7 goes down holding his knee early in the game and was forced to go off @entity0 players gather around @entity7 as he lies on the ground and receives treatment from the @entity0 medical team @entity7 left the field in tears early in the first half after picking up a knee injury @entity7 looked in pain as he hobbled off the field in the first five minutes @entity51 goes in with a high foot on @entity37 's @entity70 during the game at the @entity88 @entity0 's @entity45 shields the ball from @entity73 @entity0 's @entity49 ( left ) and @entity37 's @entity67 battle for the ball ' it was an important win for a lot of reasons , ' said @entity26			1
' @entity4 lost their game so it was important to recover points			1
to be near the leaders			0
' this is a difficult month where we have to play seven games in the @entity3			2
you ca n't win the title in december but it is a key month so you can start the new year close to the leader			0
' @entity0 nearly added a second when @entity54 was denied by a brilliant reflex save from @entity36 as he looked for his first @entity3 goal from @entity52 's neat set - up			1
substitute @entity50 shakes hands with a fan in the stands as he warms up both sets of players gather for a photo as part of the @entity242 campaign to honour the @entity244 day truce of 1914 but there were jitters towards the end as mid-table @entity37 had a late rally			0
their best opening arrived after 82 minutes and @entity75 could n't believe that @entity44 – who is close to signing a new four - and - a - half - year contract at @entity0 – stuck out a strong left hand to his shot and tipped the ball away			1
@entity52 was left dazed in injury - time after getting caught across the back of the head by a flailing elbow from the already - booked @entity70 , whose next caution will make him the first @entity3 player to receive a hundred yellow cards			1
and there was rancour from home fans towards @entity37 sub @entity69 – ironically a @entity0 target - for another theatrical fall			2
but depleted @entity0 somehow held on			2
for @entity26 now , the most immediate priority is @entity104			0
but in @entity3 terms the @entity4 v @entity0 fixture on january 31 , the final weekend of the transfer window as well , is already looking very tasty			1
@entity269 here to @entity272 's facebook page .			0

@entity28 scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot to earn @entity0 all three points
@entity7 left the field in tears after picking up a knee injury early in the game
@entity0 's win means the gap at the top of the @entity3 is just three points after @entity162 beat @entity4
