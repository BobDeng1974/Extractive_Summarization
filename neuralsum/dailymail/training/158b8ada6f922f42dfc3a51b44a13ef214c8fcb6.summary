one of @entity1 's experimental research craft has been spotted on an @entity3 runway amid claims it is being used to create high resolution 3d maps to fight terrorism			1
satellite images confirm the @entity10 aircraft was on an @entity12 military airstrip in eastern @entity13 a few weeks ago			1
however , officials have refused to reveal what it was doing there			2
the @entity10 was spotted by @entity27 satellites at an airfield in @entity29 in september the @entity10 is a mid-wing , long - range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet			1
two crew members are positioned at separate tandem stations in the forward section of the fuselage			2
the pilot station contains all the essential equipment for flying the aircraft while the sensor equipment operator ( @entity41 ) station contains both navigational equipment and controls for the operation of the payloads that are located throughout the aircraft			0
the @entity10 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours , has a range of approximately 2500 miles , and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload			1
a @entity1 official confirmed the sighting			0
' i really ca n't give you any of the details , ' @entity51 , a @entity1 official with the @entity52 , told @entity56			0
' you know , the airplane was there , you see it in the picture			0
but i really ca n't tell you what it was for			0
' according to @entity1 , the @entity66 provides ' unique , high - altitude airborne platforms to @entity69 agencies , academic institutions , and commercial customers in order to support scientific research and advanced technology development and testing at locations around the world			0
' mission examples include atmospheric and earth science , ground mapping , cosmic dust collection , rocket launch support , and test bed operations for future airborne or spaceborne systems			0
@entity86 satellite imagery of the @entity12 military base at @entity88 in @entity29 , dated sept. 20 , depicts @entity1 ’s @entity10 high - altitude aircraft on the recently - expanded auxiliary operations apron			1
' the question is — why ? what purpose does a scientific research plane have in visiting @entity12 ’s main military outpost in @entity13 ? one possible answer is … making maps for commando raids , ' said @entity99 , writing on medium			1
' we know from the @entity102 in @entity103 in june that the @entity105 sensor had already begun mapping territory for @entity107			0
' @entity108 - january 24 , 2014 : @entity86 image of some planes at the @entity108 in @entity111			1
the @entity112 released this image in 2011 to show the kind of maps the @entity116 sensor believed to have been used on the experimental craft can create			2
according to the presentation by the @entity120 ’s @entity119 , the sensor mapped more than 13,500 square kilometers in july and august 2013 - but does not say which aircraft			2
@entity99 says the move could mean the @entity12 is mapping more urban environments to create @entity125 maps to help battle planners			1
' such mapping could prove useful to @entity12 commandos fighting groups like @entity131 ’s @entity130 or @entity132 in @entity133 , ' he says			1
a @entity1 website that tracks the agency 's three @entity135 shows that one of its planes , number 926 , was on a ' foreign deployment ' from july to november this year			0

@entity107 , the @entity12 military 's @entity107 , would only say that ' aircraft from a variety of agencies and nations perform diverse missions from @entity88 in support of @entity12 and allied military peace and security operations in the region , which spans @entity13 and the @entity156			1
' one previous mission was described by @entity158 , the head of the military 's fringe - tech specialists at the @entity161 , to the @entity163 subcommittee on @entity164 earlier this year as a kind of mass , three - dimensional terrain mapping			1
it used a sensor called @entity171 - @entity170			0
the @entity10 can fly for approximately 6.5 hours , has a range of approximately 2500 miles , and can carry up to 8,800 lbs of payload			2
the plane can be fitted with a variety of sensors that could create 3d terrain maps			1
this uses light from a ' pulsed laser ' to create ' precise , three - dimensional information about the shape of the @entity183 and its surface characteristics , ' according to the @entity185			0
' @entity105 provided forces in @entity111 with unprecedented access to high - resolution 3d data , and it collected orders of magnitude faster and from much longer ranges than conventional methods , ' @entity192 said , according to written testimony			2
given 90 days , @entity192 said she was confident the system could 've mapped half the country			0
' at full operational capacity , @entity105 could enable mapping of 50 percent of @entity111 in 90 days			2
' state - of - the - art deployed systems would have required 3 years to accomplish that task , and more conventional systems would have required 30 years			0
' the @entity105 sensor pod was initially integrated onto a @entity10 - 57 aircraft and deployed to @entity111 from november 2010 through august 2011 in a joint effort with the @entity206 ( @entity207 )			1
' ' during this time , over 70,000 square kilometers of terrain data ( about 10 percent of @entity111 ) were collected , reflecting the priorities of operational units , ' @entity192 said according to @entity1 , all three @entity10 - 57s are now back in the @entity12 , with their status listed as ' inactive			1

@entity10 has previously created @entity214 terrain maps in @entity111
was spotted at a @entity12 military airstrip in eastern @entity13 a few weeks ago
*government* officials refuse to say what plane was being used for
claims it was creating maps for @entity12 commandos fighting groups like @entity131 ’s @entity130 or @entity132 in @entity133
