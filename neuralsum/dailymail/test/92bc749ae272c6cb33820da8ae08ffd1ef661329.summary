@entity2 has been ' bullied ' by the conservatives into ruling out a coalition deal between the @entity1 and @entity5 , @entity1 leader @entity0 claimed tonight			1
@entity7 's first minister said the @entity5 leader had allowed himself to be ' kicked around ' by the @entity9 and called on him to be ' tougher ' and ' bolder '			1
with polls suggesting no one party will have a majority after may 7 and support for the @entity1 hitting a record high , the @entity3 have ramped up warnings about a post-election deal between @entity5 and the @entity7 nationalists			1
@entity7 's first minister , appearing on @entity18 tonight , said the @entity5 leader had allowed himself to be ' kicked around ' by the @entity9 and called on him to be ' tougher ' and ' bolder ' she told @entity20 that @entity2 had been ' bullied ' by the conservatives into ruling out a coalition deal labour leader mr @entity2 insisted at the weekend that he is ' not interested in deals ' with the @entity1			1
in the latest of @entity26 's series of leader interviews with @entity20 , ms @entity0 said @entity29 politicians were in danger of being ' insulting ' to @entity7 voters			1
she said : ' i 've not ruled anything out here , i 've always said a coalition with @entity5 is highly unlikely , @entity2 has since said the same because he 's been sort of bullied by the @entity9 to rule these things out			2
' the @entity1 leader said she had not ruled out a confidence and supply deal between the two parties			2
when it was put to her that mr @entity2 had , she said : ' i think what he says the morning after the election will probably be different to what he says now			0
' he 's in an election campaign , he 's trying to cling to the pretence that he is going to get a majority			0
everyone else knows that 's not looking likely			0
' but what i am saying is i think a vote - by - vote arrangement is both most likely and probably the way in which a big team of @entity54 can wield maximum influence for @entity7 's benefit			0
' the @entity1 have soared in the polls to a record 54 per cent - while @entity5 have seen their support cut in half since 2010 @entity5 leader @entity2 delivers a speech at @entity62 in @entity63 today commenting further on mr @entity2 , she added : ' i think he should be a bit tougher in not being kicked around so much by the @entity9			1
' i think he should be bolder in saying that he will respect the wishes of voters because there is a more fundamental point than just how people in @entity7 vote			0
' a @entity73 spokesman said ms @entity0 's interview exposed the threat posed by the @entity1			2
he said : ' @entity0 has confirmed that she now has @entity2 wrapped around her little finger - and will use @entity1 mps to ' wield maximum influence for @entity7 's benefit '			2
that means more debt , higher taxes , unlimited welfare handouts and weaker defence - so we 'll all pay			0
the only way to stop this happening is to vote @entity73 on may 7th			0
