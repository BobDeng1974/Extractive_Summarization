by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 denied that he will be motivated by revenge when @entity3 face @entity4 in the first game of the @entity6 after @entity7 tricked him with a ‘ @entity10 ’ penalty at @entity9			1
the @entity12 playmaker turned the quarter - final penalty shootout on its head when he stepped up to the spot with his side trailing 2 - 1 after @entity17 had missed , while @entity18 and @entity19 had both scored for @entity3			1
@entity7 claimed that seeing @entity1 ‘ doing all sorts on the line ’ encouraged him to dink the ball over @entity1 and straight into the middle of the net , in the style originated by @entity10 for @entity25 against @entity26 in the final of the 1976 @entity28			1
‘ i made my decision right at the last second , when i saw @entity1 , the @entity3 goalie , doing all sorts on his line , ’ @entity7 said in his autobiography			1
‘ as i began my run - up , i still had n’t decided what i was going to do			2
and then he moved and my mind was made up			2
it was all impromptu , not premeditated			0
‘ the only way i could see pushing my chances of scoring close to 100 per cent			0
there was absolutely no showboating about it — that ’s not my style			0
’ @entity1 will come face to face with @entity7 in @entity57 for the first time since that quarter - final in @entity60 which ended in defeat for @entity3			1
although there will be no shootout in @entity3 ’s first group game in @entity65 on june 12 , @entity7 may be favoured by @entity4 to take a spot - kick			1
@entity1 claimed it was not weighing heavy in his mind			2
@entity12 job : @entity7 claimed he only tried the @entity10 after @entity1 's histrionics on the line shock to the system : @entity1 learned humility after being dropped at @entity75 earlier this season ‘ he scored , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i do n’t think he did it to embarrass me			0
he just tried to get it in the net and they won the shootout			0
’ @entity1 said he had learned humility this season after he was dropped at @entity75 in favour of @entity86 for seven @entity88 games and one @entity90 match			1
the 27 - year - old reclaimed his place in @entity94 ’s first xi but said he had learned a lesson which will benefit him in his @entity3 career			1
‘ i have learned a lot this season , that football definitely does not revolve around myself , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ there are other great keepers all over the world			0
i am at a very good club who have three good keepers			0
i am part of an @entity3 squad that have five or six to choose from			2
i just know i have to work hard to get to the best level i can be and be the best option for the manager			0
’ @entity1 is @entity110 ’s first - choice goalkeeper , ahead of @entity112 ’s @entity111 and @entity114 ’s @entity113			2
but he said he would not be taking anything for granted , having been in the @entity6 squad in @entity117 in 2010 when @entity118 lost his place to @entity120			1
@entity118 made a howler in the opening group game to gift the @entity122 a 1 - 1 draw			1
take nothing for granted : @entity118 lost his place at the @entity127 after a howler in 1 - 1 draw with @entity122 waiting in line : @entity111 ( @entity34 ) and @entity113 ( r ) will be @entity3 's reserve keepers at the @entity6 ‘ i ’m not there yet , i ’m still pushing hard , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ we have two great goalkeepers in the squad			0
we have some fantastic talent			0
@entity111 has had a fantastic season and @entity113 has kept clean sheet after clean sheet at @entity114			0
i ’m fully aware of what ’s around me and it ’s an enjoyable position to be in			0
i ’m just fighting to keep it			0
‘ in @entity117 , we were all there working as a unit and we supported @entity146 for the first game			0
he came out and @entity148 went in and we supported @entity148 , that is how it is , it is nothing personal , you have to do your best for @entity3			2
‘ that ’s the same for me , whether i am playing or not playing i will be doing my best for @entity3 .			2

@entity1 is not worried about facing a penalty by @entity7 at the @entity6 in @entity57
the @entity12 fooled him with a cheeky @entity10 when @entity4 beat @entity3 on penalties at @entity9
@entity3 no 1 has learned humility after being dropped by @entity75
@entity1 is taking nothing for granted after seeing @entity118 lose his place at the @entity127 after his howler against @entity122
