@entity1 admitted to ' unacceptable weaknesses ' in its computer systems as around 6.5 million customers - equivalent to 10 % of the @entity103 population - suffered disruption lasting for several weeks in some cases			2

the extraordinary admission a after a string of glitches where millions of debit card cash withdrawals and purchases , some credit card transactions , plus online banking and banking via mobile phone , were blocked			0
@entity1 chief executive @entity118 said the most recent systems failure was ‘ unacceptable ’ , and admitted : ‘ for decades , @entity1 failed to invest properly in its systems			0

’ in 2012 a junior technician in @entity124 was blamed for causing the @entity1 computer meltdown which froze millions of @entity103 bank accounts			1
but it later emerged it came from their @entity129 headquarters			0
they were unable to use online banking facilities or obtain accurate account balances from @entity6			2
mortgage payments were delayed and customers left without cash in foreign countries			2
the issues in summer 2012 stemmed from a botched upgrade to the software that processed updates to customers ' accounts overnight			2
when it noticed problems with the upgrade the bank 's central it function decided to uninstall it without first testing the consequences of that action			2
the bank is investigating the underlying cause of today 's problems , which it said are unrelated to the meltdown of two years ago			1
the it meltdown fine came just days after @entity1 was one of six banks fined £ 2.6billion for rigging the £ 3trillion a day foreign exchange market			1
the bank was hit with a £ 400million penalty by @entity103 and @entity160 regulators , with regulators publishing damning transcripts of its traders bragging about the conspiracy			1
the it failure has raised concerns about the state backed lender ’s creaking computer systems which have continued to let down customers in recent years			0
@entity1 suffered another systems outage in december on the busiest online shopping day of the year , the third time in about 18 months that such a problem had prevented customers from using cards , cash machines and online banking services			1
it says it has been ploughing billions of pounds into bolstering its it systems to help ensure that similar problems do not reoccur			0
the lender recently pledged to invest an extra £ 1billion in its digital and it services as it attempts to persuade more of its customers to bank online and on their mobile phones			1
before the 2008 financial crisis , @entity22 was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world			0
the bank was founded in @entity129 in 1727 , but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the @entity195 too as the @entity103 capital became the world 's leading financial centre			2
@entity1 sealed its place at the top table of @entity103 banking in 2000 when it bought @entity11 , which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the ' @entity204 ' retail banks in the @entity103			0
@entity205 , right , became chief executive of @entity1 the following year and pioneered a gung - ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division			0

with the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil , @entity1 was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations			0
the @entity220 felt it had no option but to step in , and in october 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £ 37billion of new capital			2
as the bank 's losses spiralled and it required even more bail - out money , the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent			1
much of the blame for @entity1 's troubles was attributed to @entity205 , who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004			0
