by @entity1 reporter published : 11:28 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 9 september 2013 most people think of a simple round bowl filled with eggs up in a tree when they think of a bird 's nest , but not all are the same			1
photographer @entity9 set out to catalog these works of art for her book nests			1
calling birds ' nature 's most fastidious architects , ' ms @entity9 wanted to share her fascination with structures created ' in all shapes and sizes using a variety of materials			1
' there are those that build with mud , burrow tunnels , weave hanging pendulous baskets or cups onto branches , stitch leaves , stack sticks , or glue with saliva			1
some just make simple scrapes on the ground , or fill cavities with fur and bones , and others that camouflage their nests with lichen , spiderweb , or moss , ' @entity9 wrote in her book			1
the nests featured in the book are parts of permanent collections at the @entity51 , the @entity52 at @entity53 , and the @entity54			1
many of the nests pictured were collected prior to 1950 , some are over 100 - years - old			1
nest collecting was made illegal in the @entity59 , signed into law in 1918			1
several of the photos are also on display now through may 2014 at the @entity63 , in @entity64 all captions and further descriptions are courtesy of ms @entity67			1
@entity68 ( @entity68 flaviceps ) : collected from @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , 1961 @entity72 the only @entity75 member of the penduline - tit family ( @entity77 ) , these tiny insectivores survive bitter winters and searing summers in the arid forests , scrub lands , and deserts of the @entity83 and @entity71 they manage this year - round residency by building small thorny domes for both breeding and roosting			1
fledglings as young as three months construct their own nests , and in a year a @entity68 may build a dozen solo shelters			1
@entity91 ( @entity91 ) : collected from @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , 1973 the @entity54 @entity95 live in @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98			1
using their sticky saliva , they bond a shallow platform of soft feathers and plant down to the under side of a downward hanging palm leaf			1
if palms are unavailable , they adopt other trees , or even man - made structures			1
when the female produces an egg , she carefully lowers it into the nest platform and glues it in place with saliva			1
both members of a pair incubate the eggs , pressing them tightly against the nest , trading shifts carefully			1
@entity121 ( @entity121 ) : collected from @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , 1970 the @entity54 this cup of moss and lichen was built by a pair of @entity121 in the crown of an @entity130 ? a @entity132 tree			1
the last 4,000 of these small finches are found in the high rainforests of @entity123			1
living above 1,800 feet , these survivors have escaped the mosquito - borne avian pox and malaria that have decimated so many other @entity140 birds since the 1800s when @entity143 trading ships emptied their bilges on the island			1
grazing and feral animals have also destroyed their habitats			1
of 113 endemic species , 71 have been lost			2
of the 42 left , @entity121 are one of the 32 listed as endangered			2
@entity151 ( @entity151 ) : collected from @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 relatives of blackbirds and meadowlarks , @entity156 can be found from the @entity160 to @entity161 , living in year - round territories as life - long pairs			2
it can take the female a month to weave a pendulous nest , which is entered from the top , with a nesting chamber at the bottom			2
in @entity171 , @entity170 are considered a threatened species due to the loss of the native trees of the @entity160 to agriculture and to flood control			2
@entity178 ) @entity177 ) : collected from @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity71 , 1925 the @entity54 brown boobies breed on the islands and atolls of the @entity185 , @entity186 , and @entity188 oceans , and the @entity189			2
the only species of ground - nesting booby that regularly builds a nest , its ritualized construction plays a role in the bonding and breeding partnership			2
made of almost anything available , from grass , sticks , and seaweed , to refuse and plastic , it often includes bones and the bodies of dead @entity207 chicks			2
the male , head and neck stretched high , presents a piece to the female , who accepts with the same posture			2
they both work these offerings into the nest with quivering heads , soft grunts and calls			2
@entity220 ( @entity220 ) : collected from @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , 2003 the @entity224 of @entity225 these colorful songbirds breed in woodlands in western @entity75 ? especially insect - rich land bordering water , filled with cottonwood , sycamore , and willow trees			2
most migrate to @entity71 for the winter			2
usually the female weaves the hanging nest , but her mate may help , the pair working in tandem , one on the inside , the other out			2
horse hair , twine , fibers , grasses , and wool form the outer shell , which is lined with cottonwood or willow cotton , wool , or feathers			0
the blue fibers wrapping this nest are the plastic threads of a construction tarp			0
@entity255 ( @entity255 ) : collected from @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity71 , 1932 the @entity54 found on every continent except @entity262 , @entity260 terns breed near coastal estuaries and lagoons , lakes , reservoirs , and rivers that offer small - to medium - sized fish , the major food source for these diving birds			0
they often return to their former nesting grounds , which might be species - specific colonies , or ones mixed with other species of terns , as well as gulls , plovers , cormorants , stilts , pelicans , and skimmers			0
nest construction is rudimentary , with both sexes scraping a shallow depression in the ground , adding rocks , shells , sticks , seaweed , and other plant material , and relying on the color of their eggs to camouflage them in the open			0
@entity295 ( @entity296 ) : collected from @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , 1988 the @entity54 these winged jewels are common in @entity301 and the @entity298 , with a few found in @entity302			0
like all hummingbirds , nest building and care of the young is the responsibility of the female			0
they attach their nests to supporting forks of a branch in a shrub or vine , frequently in a young coffee plant			1
their well - hidden two - inch cups are made of silky plant fibers and moss bound with spider web , with long trailing grasses and strips of plant bark that disguise its shape , and bits of lichen and bark attached to its exterior			0
@entity328 ( @entity330 bicolor ) : collected from @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity64 , 1995 the @entity224 of vertebrates these iridescent aerialists nest in cavities of older trees and snags , often those created by woodpeckers			1
goose feathers insulate this loose cup of grass and twigs found in one of these natural nesting sites , which have been disappearing over the past 200 years			0
they will readily occupy nest boxes as substitutes if they are placed near sources of insects , the mainstay of their diet			0
two @entity354 ( @entity355 ) : left : collected from @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity64 , 1926 right : collected from @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity258 , 1942 @entity72 disguised as a piece of moving bark , @entity360 circumnavigate tree trunks , consuming a wide variety of insects and bugs			1
the female builds the nest under a flap of bark or in a cavity of a dead or dying tree , or in the excavations of woodpeckers , squirrel drays , even crevices in manmade structures			0
a foundation of twigs , bark , and woodchips bound with spider web and cocoons attached at a couple of anchor points supports a layer of wood fibers , leaf fragments , hair , feathers , grasses , lichens , or moss			0
@entity392 ( @entity392 ) : collected from @entity393 , @entity394 , @entity395 , @entity396 , 1972 the @entity54 striking @entity398 and @entity400 members of the @entity402 family , a mated pair shapes a simple , sturdy cup of plant fibers and leaves , often lining it with the black threads of horsehair fungus			0
it is well hidden , usually in a tree fork or the leaves of a branch			0
they also adopt other protective sites : the fronds of banana plants , cavities in trees , abandoned hanging oropendola nests , and rarely , the cavity of a scavenged honeycomb			1
they are insectivores , but they also eat fruit ; by dispersing the seeds , they regenerate forests and , in turn , their own food supplies			0
@entity429 ( @entity429 ) : collected from @entity430 , @entity431 , @entity258 , 1974 the @entity51 discovered in 1974 , this slice of a limb of a @entity434 holds the first nest of a @entity429 to be found in @entity75 , providing important clues about the nesting habits of these small birds			0
they fly 25 miles or more inland to nest in trees 200 to 2,000 years old , with limbs wide enough for both a landing pad and a nesting platform			0
the nest is a mere depression in the moss or leaf litter			0
the parents share the care of their young , trading shifts before dawn , and fledglings make their first journey to the sea alone			0
@entity456 are disappearing along with the old growth forests that are home to these ancient trees			0
@entity460 ( @entity460 ) : collected from @entity461 , @entity462 , @entity463 , 1991 the @entity54 egret feathers camouflage this grassy dome shaped nest built by a female @entity460			0
recent immigrants to the @entity470 , their range extends to @entity471			0
they attach their nests to bushes , trees , vines , and dead branches , and often over water on tree snags and pilings			1
they also adopt abandoned houses , bridges , signposts , utility poles , and even railroad trestles			0
@entity487 ) : collected from @entity488 , @entity489 , @entity71 , 1968 the @entity54 with large eyes ringed in orange , yellow - spotted chests , and orange legs and feet , @entity491 - thrushes are a striking member of the genus of @entity499 thrushes			0
in spite of these markings , they can be extremely hard to find , staying hidden in the understory of the forests of the @entity398 highlands and the @entity506 , where they feed terrestrially and nest year - round			0
the female builds the nest using moss , lichen , and leaves , binding them with rootlets and grasses to form a deep , thick - walled cup , often woven onto a supporting vertical branch , with trailing foliage to disguise its shape .			0
