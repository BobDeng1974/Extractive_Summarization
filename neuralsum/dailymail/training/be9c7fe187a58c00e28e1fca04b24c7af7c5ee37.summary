by @entity0 the @entity2 squad bid farewell to their @entity5 training base in @entity6 on monday as they travelled to @entity7 for what is essentially a dead rubber against @entity10			1
the mood in the camp looked significantly downbeat , which is all that can be expected after @entity2 's participance at the tournament was ended by narrow defeats to @entity17 and @entity18			2
by contrast , @entity10 have arguably been the surprise package of the tournament after beating both those teams to seal their qualification into the knock out stages			0
bon voyage : @entity26 and @entity27 look reflective as they leave the team hotel in @entity6 dream is over ! @entity31 and @entity32 leave their hotel in @entity34 down and out ! @entity26 and @entity2 are heading home after failing to win their opening two games for the final game , manager @entity39 is expected to give playing time to those who have n't featured in @entity42 yet - with former @entity44 veteran @entity43 set to captain the team on what could be his last international appearance			1
@entity26 will take a place on the bench before reflecting on whether he continues to lead the @entity2 towards the 2016 @entity51			0
meanwhile , @entity52 will leave the @entity5 without experiencing any playing time after a recurrence of the knee injury that has kept him out thus far , while @entity57 has also been ruled out with hamstring injury			0
past and present ? @entity26 's ( @entity59 ) @entity2 days may be over , while @entity60 's are only beginning see you at @entity62 ? @entity63 ( @entity59 ) and @entity64 could be @entity66 teammates next season @entity69 side : @entity10 looked far more relaxed in training after securing their place in the knockout rounds rearguard : both @entity75 ( @entity59 ) and @entity76 are expected to make way for stand - ins in final game uppers and downers : @entity82 looks sombre while @entity27 manages a rare smile as they leave			2

@entity2 will play their final @entity5 2014 *fixture* on *tuesday* after failing to qualify from @entity87
losses against @entity17 and @entity18 meant @entity39 's players will not *progress* to the last 16 in @entity42
the squad looked *miserable* whilst leaving @entity6 for their *clash* against @entity10 *tomorrow*
