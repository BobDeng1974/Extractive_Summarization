taken by @entity12 photographer @entity11 , each frame is shot within the child 's first 20 seconds of life			1

after a long discussion , the pair decided that the best solution would be for @entity35 to join the doctors and nurses in the theatre while the child was being born through c - section			1
the planning needed to undertake the project then took six months , with @entity35 needing training to work in a surgical environment , requests for permission to take photographs in the clinic and requests for permission to take photographs of the mothers			0
he also needed prepare mentally for what he was going to be seeing			0
@entity35 said of the first time he was in surgery to take the photos : ' i thought back to the birth of my son			1
the whole team was there and attentive			0
' the doctor watched me from the corner of his eye , to see how i would react if i was going to faint or run away			0
and i did not even know how i felt			0
' so i hid behind my camera and i did my job			0

it was a big slap in my face			0
i made photographs throughout the duration of the surgery			0
' when everything was over and everything was fine , i went home			0
i drank coffee and waited several days			0
' i knew i was not going to look at the world the same way			0
' after taking the five pictures that the doctor asked for over a period of weeks , @entity35 realised that the photographs they had worked on together provided a unique way of looking at birth			1
since then , he has gone on to photograph more than 40 different babies in the first few seconds outside the womb , which is now being shown at an exhibition in @entity21 called the @entity102 series			1
he said : ' my perspective on the birth has changed			1
i discovered the dangers of birth			1
' it is for this reason that i have decided to show the beginnings of a new human being , during the first seconds of his life			2
i am interested in those first seconds only			2
' and what continues to amaze me is that it never stops			0
with each passing moment , a child is born , from all over the world , all the time , births never stop			2

he said : ' i know there are people who react very badly , who find it disgusting , they tell me that i do not have the right to show the children in the bloodstream , some even told me that it is not real , it is not true			0
' this is absurd , children are not born in cabbages or roses			2
' and there are those who are fascinated , i give them the opportunity to observe in detail the violence of birth			2
' but there are also people like my wife , who encouraged me to do this work , because c is beautiful birth			2
