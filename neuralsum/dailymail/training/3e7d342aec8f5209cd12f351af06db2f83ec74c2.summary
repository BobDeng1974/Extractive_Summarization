@entity9 and @entity10 heard two shots after their six - year - old @entity12 , @entity13 , ran into the backyard of retired police officer @entity16 ' @entity15 , @entity17 home			1
' when i got to her , i knew she was dead , ' @entity18 told @entity20			0
' i lifted up her head and there was nothing			0
it 's like losing a child			0
' but mr @entity16 claims the animal was pestering his pet rabbits and saw he had no choice but to shoot it dead - and police have revealed that the law is on his side			1
' i went to the window and looked and saw and the dog was running round and round and round the cage jumping up on it and clawing it , ' he said			2
when screaming at the dog did make it stop , mr @entity16 grabbed his @entity56 assault rifle and fired a warning shot from his second floor bedroom window before aiming for animal			1
' i shot one round into the dog and killed the dog , ' he said			2
police said that @entity16 called 911 immediately after shooting the dog to report the incident , and initially claimed he did not know the animal			1
killed : the @entity67 believe he shot dead their pet , @entity13 , as revenge for their complaints about his noise scene : but mr @entity16 said the dog was barking at and scaring his rabbits in this outdoor cage but the @entity76 insist he recognised the dog , who ran around their garden in summer			1
they said they think he aimed for the dog as they 've previously complained about @entity16 ' target shooting			1
lt. @entity85 from the @entity86 said : ' [ @entity87 ] probably could have handled it a little bit differently , be more neighbour - like			0
but what he did is not illegal			2
' state law dictates that ' any person may kill a dog that is … out of the care of its owner … worrying , wounding , or killing sheep , lambs , fowl , or other domestic animals '			1
there has been some contention over the exact meaning of the word ' worrying ' and the @entity76 are now calling on lawmakers to scrap it from the law			1
missed : the @entity109 said @entity13 , a six - year - old @entity12 , was like a child to them sadness : @entity9 and @entity10 plan on filing a civil lawsuit against @entity16 and asked for a change in the law in light of the incident , rep. @entity116 said on thursday that he plans to call a meeting with local legislators to see if the law should be changed due to the different interpretation of ' worrying '			1
sen. @entity123 said the term ' worrying ' was included to protect livestock , especially sheep , in situations where they may be chased by dogs , causing them damage while not being attacked			2
' there is a legitimate reason for that terminology , ' he said			0
' it 's not the law that 's wrong , it 's people not behaving			2
' he added : ' this situation just highlights that we have individuals who use no common sense			0
this should have been resolved in a manner of good neighborly relations			0
i 'm sure that dog would have gone back home if it was scolded			0
there was no need to shoot it			0
