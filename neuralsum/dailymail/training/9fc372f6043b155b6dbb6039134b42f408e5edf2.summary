@entity0 cheered jokes about killing the @entity2 and lynching @entity4 cabinet minister @entity3 at a tasteless @entity6 event the @entity7 today tried to disown comments made by a senior backbencher about wanting to ' lynch ' a @entity4 cabinet minister			1
left - winger @entity13 made the offensive remarks about employment minister @entity3 at a tasteless @entity6 event , the @entity12 revealed today			1
he told the audience how a campaign had been launched to kick ms @entity3 out of her seat , but activists were arguing ' why we are sacking her ? why are n't we lynching the b * * * * * * ? '			1
the @entity4 condemned the public call for a ' violent attack ' on a female mp			1
but the @entity7 only tweeted a message in response , stating : ' @entity13 's comments , if accurately reported , do n't represent the views of the @entity7			2
' mr @entity13 said he regarded the ' @entity12 having a go at me ' as a ' badge of honour '			2
he added : ' all i 'm saying is do n't blame me for simply repeating what some of @entity3 's constituents have said at a public meeting			1
' the ' anti-war comedy night ' even featured remarks mocking the ceramic poppies at the @entity39 and killing the @entity2			1
among those attending the event at a club in @entity43 were former shadow minister @entity44 and @entity46 - wing mp @entity45			1
last night , @entity47 faced calls to condemn the mps for taking part in the ' sickening ' event , held as the sacrifices made by our armed forces since the start of the @entity56 100 years ago were honoured across the country			2
but mr @entity45 risked causing further offence by insisting the comedy night – organised as a tribute to labour firebrand and anti-war campaigner @entity61 , who died in march aged 88 – was ' a great event ' that he ' really enjoyed '			1
in his speech , mr @entity13 , the mp for @entity64 and @entity65 , spoke about a visit to miss @entity3 's @entity69 constituency , where the former tv presenter faces a major union - backed campaign to oust her from the marginal seat			1
to applause , he said : ' i was up in @entity76 a fortnight ago where @entity77 , one of our [ union ] organisers , launched the @entity82 @entity81 on her birthday			2
' i spoke at a packed public meeting ... there was a whole group in the audience that completely kicked off quite critical of the whole concept , because they were arguing ' why we are sacking her ? ' why are n't we lynching the b * * * * * * ? ' comedian @entity94 was then loudly cheered and applauded when he said : ' i 'm not a fan of the @entity2 , they are a bunch of parasites			1
' he added : ' there are royalists in [ the audience ] , i can feel the anger			2
' leave them alone '			2
no , kill ' em. ' joke : @entity13 gave a speech joking about employment minister ms @entity3 being lynched while left - winger @entity45 said it was ' a great event ' that he ' really enjoyed ' @entity110 mp @entity44 was also at the event but has refused to comment on the story left - wing activist and blogger @entity113 , who uses the stage name @entity116 , mocked the @entity39 ceramic poppies as ' a river of blood '			1
last night @entity4 @entity0 demanded that mr @entity13 have the @entity110 whip withdrawn until he apologises and withdraws his comments about @entity122			1
defence minister @entity123 said : ' these comments , made on @entity6 of all days , are extremely serious			1
there can be no excuse for a member of parliament to fantasise about someone 's death			2
' @entity47 must remove the whip from @entity13			2
the @entity7 must not be a refuge to those who incite violence			2
' @entity135 chairman @entity134 said : ' it 's sickening that @entity0 chose to mark @entity6 , a hundred years since the outbreak of @entity56 , by making vile death threats against a female mp			1
@entity47 faces calls to condemn the @entity0 for taking part in the ' sickening ' event , held on @entity6 as the rest of country paid tribute to the fallen the ' anti-war comedy night ' even featured remarks mocking the ceramic poppies at the @entity39 ' @entity47 has totally lost control			0
his own frontbench mps are inciting hatred and violence against women			0
@entity13 should be forced to withdraw his disgusting comments , and apologise			0
' the @entity7 , mr @entity13 and miss @entity155 did not respond to requests to comment last night			0

' mp @entity13 ' i was up in @entity76 a fortnight ago where @entity77 , one of our organisers , launched the @entity82 @entity81 on her birthday			1
i spoke at a packed public meeting , it was absolutely packed but there was a whole group in the audience that completely kicked off quite critical of the whole concept because they were arguing , ' why are sacking her , why are n't we lynching the bastard ? ' ' @entity61 [ @entity176 ] always said how you can use a ballot box to change the world			0
but there 's [ another ] way too , which in the old days we called insurrection , now we call it direct action			1
it 's when the government do n't do as you want , you get in the streets or you occupy and you take direct action against them			0
' ' electorally , let 's just learn the lessons from @entity61 , electorally let 's be absolutely clear , in this election in may coming up we 've got to get these b * * * * * * s out			0
we 've got to destroy this government			0
we can not cope with the re-election of a @entity4 @entity198 in whatever coalition form it is , because our society can not cope with it			0
that 's why for those people who are talking about not voting or not mobilising , to be frank that 's a combination of dereliction of duty and cowardice			0
' activist @entity113 ' we need a new politics			0
we need radical change , we 're moving towards a next general election where no one 's got any * * * * * * * hope at all			0
any decent person would want to vote @entity110 , any decent person would , but they 're in * * * * * * * bits			1
@entity47 said they 're going to [ put ] 25p on the minimum wage ... we 've got every single politician standing up and talking about affordable housing			0
it 's the biggest bunch of s * * * ever			0
' ' today is 100 years [ since the start of the @entity56 ] , this is what they 're celebrating with a river of blood coming out of the @entity39 from the royals , from the monarch , and they 're all there today			0
and @entity233 's there today , @entity233 , that 's the @entity7 's gift to the world			0
' comedian @entity94 ' i 'm not a fan of the @entity2 , they are a bunch of parasites			1
