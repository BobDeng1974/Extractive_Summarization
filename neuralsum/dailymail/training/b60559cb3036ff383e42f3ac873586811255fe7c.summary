by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:14 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 09:12 est , 3 october 2013 a @entity3 instructor says her devotion to the fitness classes nearly killed her - after they caused an undetected hole in her heart to grow bigger and bigger			1
@entity9 , 20 , had to have her chest cut open in january to allow doctors to sew up the hole which was ' insignificant ’ when she was born			1
the fitness fanatic from @entity15 , @entity16 , first noticed something was awry when she became tired and breathless , but never suspected it could be something so serious			1
@entity9 , 20 , was diagnosed with a hole in the heart after becoming tired and breathless			1
the @entity3 instructor had probably had the hole since birth but her active lifestyle could have made it worse without major open - heart surgery , ms @entity9 would have been at risk of suffering a severe heart attack or stroke as the hole in her heart caused one side of the vital organ to become enlarged			1
she said : ' i was n’t feeling well at all			0
i was really run down and i was finding teaching difficult			0
' doctors did a series of tests and found an infection , which led them to tell me i had a virus in my liver			2
' i put up with it for a couple of months until i started having trouble breathing and i was admitted to hospital			1
' further tests and an @entity44 revealed ms @entity9 had a heart murmur and an ultrasound soon found the hole in her heart - something that she is likely to have had since birth			1
doctors told her the hole could have been made worse by exercise			1
in january , surgeons at @entity54 performed open - heart surgery on the @entity3 instructor after a keyhole procedure failed			1
surgeons tried to close the hole in ms @entity9 's heart during a keyhole procedure but it failed so she had to have open - heart surgery which involved breaking her sternum after the surgery , ms @entity9 had to sleep sitting up for five weeks and she has to spend six months recovering before returning to @entity63 but in order to operate on her successfully , doctors had to break her sternum			1
this involved making an incision in her abdomen and disjointing the ribs behind her chest			2
to close the wound , medics inserted metal wires to pull ms @entity9 ’s chest back together , for her bone to grow around and heal			1
she said : ' when i woke up , i must have just twitched a tiny amount and the whole top half of my body was in agony			0
ms @entity9 said : ' when i woke up , i must have just twitched a tiny amount and the whole top half of my body was in agony			2
there was a searing pain across my chest and it took my breath away ' ' there was a searing pain across my chest and it took my breath away			0
just the slightest movement made everything hurt			0
' i had to be washed , dressed , showered , and even have my teeth brushed and walking was particularly difficult			0
' i could n’t walk and my arms hanging down by my side was incredibly painful			0
' as well as being forced to sleep sitting upright for the first five weeks , ms @entity9 then faced a six - month recovery period , before she could get back to her active self			1
she said : ' i had to be washed , dressed , showered , and even have my teeth brushed and walking was particularly difficult			0
i could n't walk and my arms handing down by my side was incredibly painful ' she said : ' it was really hard stopping my fitness			0
it was going really well before i found out about the hole in my heart and i was developing a client base who i did n’t want to let down			2
' everything stopped and came to a standstill			0
i was just trying to establish myself when i had to wait until i was better to carry on			0
' she added : ' i did n’t talk about it much while i was ill. it would have been really easy to just mope about and i wanted to stay as positive as possible			0
to correct the hole in ms @entity9 's heart , surgeons had to open up her chest and separate her sternum ' when you ’re told something like that you have to stay strong for self - preservation			1
' it was really hard being in a hospital surrounded by elderly patients but i knew i needed the operation , even though i am so young			0
' ms @entity9 ’s heart condition was not picked up on while she was a baby , she and her parents @entity126 and @entity128 , have since discovered that a simple test could have been done			1
mrs @entity9 , 51 , said : ' @entity9 ’s condition was n’t picked up when she was born because the hole was so small and was n’t causing her obvious symptoms			1
' but now i think back to things that were unexplained and now they make sense			0
i just did n’t want to over-react and panic over the smallest of things			0
' it ’s such a cheap test and most parents would pay out of their own pockets just to be sure if they knew it could potentially save their child in the future			0
' it should be something that is checked as standard			0
' despite still getting aches and pains , ms @entity9 is now back to her active self and she is looking forward to a successful life as a @entity3 instructor with the support of fiancé @entity153			1
she said : ' my family and @entity153 have been so supportive throughout everything and been there for me through all the bad times when i was n’t feeling myself			0
' this is something that is associated with people in their 70s and 80s but people need to realise that it happens to young people like me as well			0
' ms @entity9 ( pictured with her fiancé , @entity153 ) is now hoping to return to work as a @entity3 instructor			1
she also hopes to raise awareness about holes in the heart so people realise they can happen to anyone ms @entity9 is hoping to raise awareness of her experience to help other young adults who may suffer with a hole in their heart that is not detected until later in life			1
she has so far raised £ 500 for @entity179 , a @entity16 - based charity which aims to help patients suffering from heart conditions and offers support to their relatives			2
he mother added : ' @entity179 gave me a room next door to where @entity9 was in the hospital with a bed and a shower			2
it was all free and it was fantastic because i could just be there for her the whole time			0
' @entity196 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity198 , said : ' if there is something wrong with a baby ’s heart at birth they are said to have congenital heart disease			2
ms @entity9 said : ' it was really hard stopping my fitness			2
it was going really well before i found out about the hole in my heart and i was developing a client base who i did n't want to let down ' ' there are many types of congenital heart disease and " hole in the heart " is a rare defect in the wall between two of the heart ’s chambers			2
' some congenital heart problems are now picked up during pregnancy but sometimes they ’re not found until the baby has been born			0
' some conditions may not be discovered until the child is an adult , although a hole in the heart is more commonly spotted in childhood			2
' it ’s vitally important a hole in the heart is picked up as early as possible so children can be monitored and get the right treatment , which is normally heart surgery			1
if you want more information about congenital heart disease , call our @entity240 on 0300 330 3311			0
' holes in the heart are congenital heart defects which change the normal flow of blood through the heart			0
the hole is usually found in the wall between the two different sides of the heart - the septum			1
about eight in every 1,000 babies have a hole in the heart			2
symptoms include fatigue , shortness of breath , a build up of fluid in the lungs and swelling in the ankles , feet , legs and abdomen			0
if the hole is not closed , it can cause heart failure or stroke			1
whether treatment is required depends on the severity of the problem - some people never require treatment for the hole in their heart			1
if the hole is large , surgery if often required to close it			1
