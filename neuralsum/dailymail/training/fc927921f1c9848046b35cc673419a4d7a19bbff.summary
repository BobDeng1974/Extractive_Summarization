charges of sexual assault against college football champion @entity2 from @entity3 that were dropped in december last year are being re-examined once again			2
an independent investigator claims to have found evidence that @entity3 administrators and @entity8 police ' took steps to both hide , and then hinder ' the investigation			0
a reporter for @entity13 has uncovered thousands of pages of documents			0
@entity2 was the target of a rape investigation after a fellow student said he sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated back in december 2012 as a teammate filmed the act			0
police reports were effectively ' sat on ' for almost a year before they were given to state attorney @entity33 , but which point the chance of bringing charges against @entity2 was far weaker			1
@entity13 claims that on november 8 , 2013 , a reporter for the @entity37 contacted @entity8 police to request copies of reports of the alleged rape involving @entity2			2
the @entity8 police forwarded the reports to @entity43 , chief of the @entity44			2
@entity3 officials and campus police then attempted to learn more about the reporter seeking the documents			0
in an e-mail to perry obtained by @entity51 , @entity49 asked , ' do we no ( sic ) if its sports dept ? ' later that morning the @entity8 police records clerk sent an e-mail to @entity43 identifying the reporter who requested the documents			0
the university 's police chief forwarded the reports to a high - ranking administrator in the @entity3 athletic department , and within days they ultimately wound up in the hands of @entity2 's defense attorney there was then some debate over a series of emails as to whether a report had been released into the media			1
four days later on november 12 , a reporter from @entity71 came by to ask for more information over the assault charges			0
this time , @entity74 of the @entity3 police responded : ' i can advise you that @entity2 is not under any investigation by the @entity44 , nor has he been questioned regarding any criminal case by the @entity44			2
i just called the on - duty shift to make sure nothing was breaking right now and they report nothing regarding @entity2 going on			0
thank you for contacting me regarding this rumor – i am glad i can dispel that one			0
' although @entity74 's e-mail was accurate , @entity2 , was the subject of an investigation by the @entity30 , not the university police department @entity90 then sent and email to the @entity92 and @entity93 , associate vice president for integrated marketing and communications saying : ' wow – crazy ! rumor control ! ' two critical witnesses signed affidavits backing @entity2 's version of the incident even before police had spoken to them the following day , on november 13 , @entity33 , @entity103 's state attorney was notified of the allegations against @entity2			1
@entity2 's attorney , @entity105 , had received the police reports days earlier			1
in the days that followed , @entity105 met with @entity2 's teammates @entity109 and @entity111 , who had witnessed some of the sexual encounter between @entity2 and the woman a notary was hired who recorded identical statements by @entity109 and @entity111 swearing that the encounter was consensual before they had even spoken to the police			1
@entity71 then published the first report of the allegations against @entity2 that night , hours after @entity33 had first learned of their existence			0
by this point , it was almost a week after the allegations had been made and key witnesses had been university administrators and @entity2 ’s attorney , @entity105 , had a head start on the state attorney in @entity8 responsible for investigating and prosecuting serious crimes			1
@entity3 administrators , had all the police reports at least four days before state attorney @entity33 was handed the case			1
@entity2 , 20 , won the @entity135 while guiding @entity3 's football team to a national championship , but he has been involved in a number of embarrassing off - field incidents			1

@entity3 's police chief obtained original police reports at least four days before the case was turned over to the local prosecutor responsible for investigating serious crimes and filing criminal charges
the university 's police chief forwarded the reports to a high - ranking administrator in the @entity3 athletic department , and within days they ultimately wound up in the hands of @entity2 's defense attorney
two critical witnesses signed affidavits backing @entity2 's version of the incident even before police had spoken to them
