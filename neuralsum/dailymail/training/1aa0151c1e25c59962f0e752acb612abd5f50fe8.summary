by @entity0 these stunning images may look like abstract works by the likes of @entity4 - but they are actually aerial photographs of the world we live in			1
known as the @entity8 , these incredible views are sometimes experienced naturally by astronauts during spaceflight			0
while orbiting the @entity11 , the astronauts ' perspective changes and they begin to see patterns in the natural and man - made world they just left			0
a website , the @entity19 , is dedicated to this effect - posting daily patterns that can be seen on @entity11 from above using images from satellite company @entity22			2
some of the aerial patterns that can be found using @entity22 's software are well - known wonders such as @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29 , @entity30			1
others are less common - like the cubist effect of @entity34 's streets or the cell - like patterns in some of @entity38 's towns			0
@entity39 , spokeswoman for @entity22 , said the company had recently grown to include five satellites , creating the capacity to collect more than one billion square kilometres of imagery to its archive this year alone			2
' we plan to launch a sixth satellite on august 13 2014 which will enable accurate satellite imaging through haze , fog , dust , smoke and other air - born particulates			1
' a stunning satellite view of @entity26 in @entity27 shows it as it has never before been seen - its perfect rectangular boundaries set among hundreds of buildings the @entity29 in @entity30 ( left ) is an artificial set of islands connected to the @entity30 mainland by monorail and one which looks dazzling , while the obscure village of @entity64 in the @entity65 has found itself photographed alongside some of the biggest landmarks in the world due to its beauty from above @entity70 and @entity71 , in @entity72 , share a car parking site for their baseball and @entity77 teams - the @entity78 and @entity79 the seaweed farms decorating the coast in @entity82 , in @entity83 , create an incredible pattern when seen through crystal clear waters from above it is n't the best seat in the house , but this view has its own appeal			1
it is the @entity92 in @entity27 - the site of many famous @entity95 tennis matches the almost symmetrical design in the @entity97 highlights the extraordinarily disciplined grid patterns used in the construction of the @entity34 suburb the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 , is known as the ' @entity104 ' due to its use as an aircraft and missile maintenance facility this is @entity110 as you 've never seen it before - the island city is famed for its beauty from the ground but is equally stunning when captured from high above this image captures the word ' @entity117 ' on a @entity119 farm , which is famous simply for the landowner 's decision to fell trees in a pattern which revealed his name the @entity126 cemetery , in @entity127 , @entity128 , ( left ) looks dizzying from above			0
it is one of the largest cemeteries in @entity132 with an estimated 5 million buried in it , while pictured right is the district of @entity136 , in @entity137 , which is home to the famous @entity139 @entity140			0
