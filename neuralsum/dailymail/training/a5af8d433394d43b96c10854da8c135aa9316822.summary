@entity0 , 12 , is one of only 82 people in the @entity2 suffering from a rare form of dementia like many girls her age , 12 - year - old @entity0 dreams of being a ballerina			1
she is seldom happier than when she ’s dancing around to her favourite pop star @entity8 , or cuddling up with her mother on the sofa watching a dvd			0
but despite her tender years and lust for life , the smiling schoolgirl is battling the debilitating effects of dementia , a disease more commonly associated with the elderly			0
her very rare neurological condition , @entity20 , is making her old before her time			1
it is gradually robbing her of memory and mobility , and causing her to suffer other indignities such as incontinence and confusion			1
there is currently no cure			0
yesterday her 29 - year - old mother @entity29 , from @entity30 , told of her daughter ’s incredible bravery in a bid to raise awareness of the degenerative condition			1
‘ we do n’t know when this cruel disease will take @entity0			1
' we were told it could be two years or ten			0
@entity0 is 12 and she ’s still fighting			2
she never stops smiling , ’ she said			0
‘ she has big dreams for a wonderful life			0
i just hope a cure is found soon so all her wishes come true			2
’ @entity0 was born seemingly healthy , but at two weeks old she had to go to hospital after developing jaundice and a swollen stomach			2
doctors then tested her for @entity20			2
miss @entity29 said : ‘ the condition is so rare that a skin graft was taken from her arm and sent for analysis to @entity52			1
it was six months before we got the devastating results			0
’ @entity0 was eventually diagnosed as one of only 82 people who currently have the disease in the @entity2 ; there are thought to be just 500 cases worldwide			1
unbeknown to miss @entity29 , both she and @entity0 ’s father @entity60 carried the gene responsible for the disease			1
‘ we were told she may never walk or talk properly and if she did she would lose these skills at an early age			0
rarely do people with @entity67 live into their teens , ’ she said			0
her mother @entity29 , 29 ( pictured left with her daughter now and right when she was six months old ) said she hopes a cure for @entity20 will be found soon ‘ i remember feeling utterly stunned that i might not see my baby girl grow up , but after going through a mix of emotions i decided to get on with life and raise @entity0 as if she had a whole future ahead of her			1
’ the condition causes an excess of cholesterol to build up in cells which affect the brain and other organs			0
but @entity0 defied the odds , learning to talk at 12 months , and walk three months later			2
however , at the age of six she became quite unco - ordinated , had trouble holding a pen and showed frequent signs of confusion			0
@entity0 ( pictured left aged seven and right aged 11 with her brother , seven - year - old @entity89 ) defied the odds by learning to talk and walk but started to become unco - ordinated when she was aged six the young girl joined professional ballet dancers on stage during a day out in 2013 arranged by the @entity94 nevertheless , she still managed to join professional ballet dancers on stage at a rehearsal of @entity98 in @entity99 , during a special day out arranged by the @entity94 in 2009			2
as the disease took hold , @entity0 also developed an associated condition called cartoplexy , which means she collapses to the floor when she laughs			1
@entity0 ’s younger brother @entity89 , seven , has overtaken her in reading , writing and drawing – but miss @entity29 said he tries to help her with the basic skills			1
