@entity1 chiefs have banned staff from using the term ‘ the elderly ’ and suggested ‘ older people ’ as an alternative			1
according to @entity7 , a 31 - page booklet handed out to 5,000 employees at @entity9 in @entity10 , the word elderly is an ‘ unacceptable ’ phrase			1
similarly , an office is not manned but staffed , dinner ladies should be referred to as catering staff , workmen are workers , headmaster is head teacher , chairman is chairperson and a child or youngster is a younger person			2
politically incorrect : ' older people ' have replaced the elderly in @entity22 , @entity10 ( right ) the booklet , produced in @entity24 and @entity25 , told staff : ‘ we should not make assumptions based on someone 's age			1
' being older in the @entity30 carries views of being worn out and of little use , it is also used as a term of abuse			0
' youth can be seen as representing inexperience and unreliability			0
' it added : ' the terms love , dear , pet may be considered offensive by some people , particularly women and should not be used			1
' we should always consider whether it is necessary or appropriate to use labels to describe people and we must be careful not to patronise people by undermining their individuality			2
national stereotypes : staff are told to avoid works like ' @entity51 ' for @entity52			0
the guide says labels should be avoided and adds : ' we must be careful not to patronise people by undermining their individuality ' ' do n't say " some of my friends are gay , " " you 're just like one of the lads , " " i remember when i was young " or " you might not want to do that at your age "			0
also banned are @entity63 or @entity64 for @entity65 , @entity51 for @entity52 and @entity66			0
and instead of saying @entity69 name , staff should say ' first name ' or forename			0
@entity73 of the @entity74 ’ @entity72 said : ‘ @entity22 council need to waste less time and less taxpayers ’ money producing bureaucratic garbage and instead focus on providing services that residents and the elderly rely on ... rather than this ridiculous taxpayer - funded pointless pontificating			1

rule was *revealed* in 31 - page booklet for @entity9 staff
@entity10 authority also says calling people ' love ' or ' pet ' can be offensive
@entity72 : it 's a waste of time and pointless pontificating
