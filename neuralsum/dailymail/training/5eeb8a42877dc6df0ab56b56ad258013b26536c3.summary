it is 3am on wednesday , september 10			0
outside the private terminal of @entity5 airport , a fleet of cars are waiting to take @entity7 ’s weary under - 21 squad home			2
their four - hour flight back from the @entity12 capital @entity13 has just touched down , bringing an end to a tiring six day tour of @entity16 , and as the players file through the small arrivals building , thoughts are centred around climbing back into their own beds			2
but as @entity22 ’s squad enter the car park , something spontaneous happens			1
one by one , the players begin to form a group , focusing back on the door they have just come through , to make sure none of their team - mates have been left behind			1
nobody wants to speed off			0
nobody is left out of this bonding moment before the convoy of disperses to different parts of the country			0
to watch the scene unfold is fascinating			0
such camaraderie is something you would expect from a club team , not an international squad , but the environment @entity22 has created over the last 14 months has allowed this chemistry to build and means these young players are ready for anything			1
‘ it is special , this team spirit we have , and i think the players will look back on this and realise it was special , ’ says @entity22			1
‘ i remember @entity70 and @entity71 saying how close they were as a team in the under - 21s under @entity75 , but i think there is a special bond around now			1
‘ it gives you a real chance as it transmits itself on to the pitch , ’ says @entity32 manager @entity22 ‘ they are really close			1
they all mix with each other and it is quite unique			0
i come down in the mornings and individuals will be sitting with one person one day and another the next at the breakfast table			0
the interaction is brilliant and i believe it is very powerful			0
’ it is also significantly different to how it was for the last under - 21 group that went to the @entity95 in @entity96 18 months ago			2
back then , @entity97 had a number of individuals whose presence was disruptive , distracting and detrimental to @entity7 ’s ability to progress			0
@entity22 , however , picks his squad as much on character as he does talent and being blessed with skill alone will no longer secure a player @entity7 recognition			1
if the balance in the dressing room is right , the potential to win is enhanced			0
‘ it gives you a real chance as it transmits itself on to the pitch , ’ @entity22 continued			1
‘ we have carefully selected players who buy into it and if it gets tough these are the intangibles that help you get results			2
the desire to run that extra five yards for your mate to get a block in that stops a shot			0
’ the willingness to chase lost causes , to fight and battle , was evident in @entity131 on friday night , as @entity7 put themselves on the brink of qualifying for @entity133 , and those qualities will be essential on tuesday when battle resumes with @entity35 in @entity136			1
@entity7 have a 2 - 1 advantage to protect from the first leg but they can expect to be challenged like never before			1
@entity35 will be physical , intimidating and will look to bully @entity22 ’s players ; the crowd , meanwhile , will be partisan , the atmosphere hostile			1
‘ it ’s just about nailing everything down , ’ said @entity7 captain @entity142			2
‘ if we do n’t win , we miss out on a major tournament			2
who knows what ’s going to happen out there ? they ’re not going to make it easy for us			0
so any way i can help or any experience i can pass on , i will			0
’ @entity7 have a 2 - 1 advantage to protect from the first leg but they can definitely expect to be challenged this , more than anything , will be a test of their mental strength as much as their footballing aptitude but it is an examination @entity7 must pass			1
@entity22 is adamant the talent pool of young players in this country is deep but he is aware only positive results will convince a sceptical public			1
‘ we have to play football but we have got to be prepared for what they will throw at us , ’ said @entity22			1
‘ i do n’t suppose @entity35 will come at us from the first minute as they know 1 - 0 will be enough but i believe we will go there and score			1
‘ it would have been easy for them to panic when they went behind on friday			2
we have got brave players			0
i never see them duck out of challenges			0
in order to progress , they need to handle these games			0
they handled it on friday and they have to show they can handle it again			0

@entity22 's @entity32 team *emerged* 2 - 1 winners against @entity35
@entity22 says ‘ i remember @entity70 and @entity71 saying how close they were as a team in the under - 21s under @entity75 '
the @entity36 boss adds he feels there is a ' special bond ' in the camp
