by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 07:02 est , 13 june 2013 a historical mystery has been uncovered at @entity2 after 15 aristocratic bodies disappeared from the crypt			1
in the @entity7 era , the @entity5 built a special chapel to house the bodies of his descendants - but 500 years later , nearly all of them have gone missing			1
the body - snatching whodunnit was only revealed last week , when archaeologists opened up the sealed crypt and found 15 fewer bodies than they had expected			1
he intended the chapel to house him and his descendants after their deaths , and when he died he was buried there			1
the monument to the fourth @entity34 - along with that to his grandson , the sixth @entity34 , who guarded @entity37 - became one of the church 's most famous features			1
more than a dozen of their descendants were also buried in the chapel , as the @entity44 were considered @entity2 's leading family thanks to their status as @entity47			1
investigation : @entity50 rev. @entity49 peers into the entrance buried in the chapel 's floor discovery : workers had to dig deep through the centuries - old floor of the chapel to find the crypt however , by 1809 all but two of the coffins supposed to be in the chapel had vanished , according to antiquarian @entity61 , the last man to visit the crypt before it was sealed in the early 19th century			1
although @entity61 dutifully recorded the loss of the 15 bodies , his discovery seems to have slipped out of the historical record until this year			0
a renovation project began in the cathedral earlier this year , and last week workmen were digging up the floor of the chapel when they came across the entrance to the @entity22 tomb			1
however , when they entered they realised that of the 17 nobles supposed to be buried there , only two remained - the seventh @entity34 , @entity76 , who died in 1616 , and 18th - century aristocrat @entity77			1
powerful : @entity27 , sixth @entity5 , is supposed to be in the crypt of the @entity22 iconic : the monument to the sixth @entity34 , pictured , is one of the most impressive sights in the cathedral the most obvious solution to the puzzle might seem to be grave - snatching , but the fact that the heavy lead coffins are missing as well as the corpses themselves would seem to suggest that this was not the case			1
archaeologists are now exploring the possibility that the crypt harbours a secret wall concealing the true location of the bodies			1
alternatively , the coffins may have been removed from the chapel and taken to a different location			2
cathedral officials are now collaborating with historians from the @entity102 in an effort to crack the mystery and hunt down the bodies			2
@entity106 , the @entity107 , said : ' we will be working closely with our partners at @entity102 to solve this mystery , as one of the missing bodies belongs to one of the most important men in @entity115 - @entity27 , the sixth @entity5			1
' patriarch : @entity27 , the fourth @entity34 , who built the chapel , is commemorated alongside his two wives gone : the fourth @entity34 and 14 of his descendants appear to have vanished from their resting place @entity27 , fourth @entity5 ( d. 1538 ) @entity37 , @entity122 - wife of the fifth @entity34 ( d. 1538 ) @entity123 , marshal of @entity125 - son of the fourth @entity34 ( d. unknown ) @entity127 , fifth @entity5 ( d. 1560 ) @entity129 - infant son of the sixth @entity34 ( d. 1565 ) @entity130 , @entity131 ( d. 1566 ) @entity37 , countess of @entity132 ( d. 1572 ) @entity133 ( d. 1573 ) @entity27 - infant son of the seventh @entity34 ( d. 1577 ) @entity135 , countess of @entity136 ( d. 1581 ) @entity127 , @entity137 ( d. 1582 ) @entity27 , sixth @entity5 ( d. 1590 ) @entity138 ( d. 1594 ) @entity139 - brother of the seventh @entity34 ( d. 1595 ) @entity37 , @entity131 ( d. 1632 ) the @entity27 family , who were ennobled in the 15th century as the @entity5 , owned most of @entity2 and rose to become one of @entity143 's most influential families under the @entity145 dynasty			1
the fourth @entity34 built the @entity22 before his death in 1538 , and in his will ordered a monument to be made featuring him flanked by his two wives , @entity150 and @entity135			0
he married @entity150 when he was just 13 , and the couple had 11 children before she died and he re-married			0
the @entity34 was made lieutenant general of the @entity154 , and once entertained @entity155 as the notorious priest travelled south to face trial for treason			0
in 1536 , he put down the ' @entity159 ' , a popular rebellion against @entity161 's religious policy			0
however , it is his grandson , the sixth @entity34 , who has the largest monument in @entity2 , standing against the chapel 's south wall			1
he was best known for marrying @entity167 , then the richest woman in @entity143 apart from @entity135 , and for guarding @entity37 during her 14 years of imprisonment in @entity2			2
looking after @entity37 , the mother of @entity170 , nearly ruined him financially - and he is said to have suffered emotional turmoil too , having fallen in love with her yet being forced to watch her execution			0

at his funeral , so many townspeople turned out to catch a glimpse of his coffin that two trees were said to have collapsed under the weight of the men who had climbed them to get a better look			0
