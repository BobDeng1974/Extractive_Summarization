by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 17:06 est , 16 march 2013 her oscar - winner husband @entity1 is notorious for immersing himself in his film roles both on and off the set			1
so when @entity5 comes down to breakfast , she can never be sure who will be sitting across from her – a murderous oil tycoon , revered @entity10 president , villainous @entity12 mobster , or even an @entity14 terrorist			1
yet while many would find life as the wife of such an intense ‘ method actor ’ a challenge , novelist @entity15 sees the benefits in such a schizophrenic environment , saying it has enhanced her writing			1
novelist @entity15 says that living with such an intense method actor has enhanced her writing ‘ i think it ’s helped , ’ she insists			2
‘ @entity27 is a lot about creating characters , inhabiting them			0
’ but , she adds , whereas her husband ’s personas are seen by many thousands of filmgoers , hers are ‘ private , and people do n’t get to see ’ the creative process			1
@entity1 recently won his third @entity36 , this time for his leading role in biopic @entity38 indeed , @entity1 , 55 , praised his wife ’s patience as he accepted his @entity36 last month for portraying @entity41 in @entity43 ’s historical drama			2
‘ since we got married 16 years ago my wife @entity44 has lived with some very strange men , ’ he said			0
‘ i mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group			0
but luckily she ’s the versatile one in the family and she ’s been the perfect companion to all of them			0
’ miss @entity5 , 50 , the daughter of playwright @entity54 , admits she has become accustomed to living with her husband ’s film personas			1
‘ all his characters are wonderful to live with , in their own way , ’ she says , adding wryly : ‘ my favourite was @entity61			0
because he filmed away from home , and i did n’t have to live with him			0
’ the couple split their time between @entity65 and @entity12 , living with their two sons , @entity68 , 14 , and @entity69 , ten , and @entity1 ’s 17 - year - old son @entity70 by @entity72 actress @entity71			2
and having the president for a husband and father was undoubtedly easier on the family than sharing their home with @entity79 , the violent oil magnate in @entity1 ’s 2007 drama @entity79			1
day - @entity1 is famous for his method acting , here as a murderous gangster in @entity83 he has confessed : ‘ they did go a little bit crazy living with @entity85 all the time , but the kids thought it was a laugh in the end to have this different bloke as their dad			1
my wife is amazingly tolerant			0
she just believes , like i do , that if you are attempting anything of a creative nature , no rules apply			0
’ miss @entity5 ’s latest novel @entity97 , about an 18th century @entity100 @entity99 merchant who is reincarnated as a housefly in modern - day @entity12 , was published in the @entity10 last week and comes to the @entity104 in may .			2
