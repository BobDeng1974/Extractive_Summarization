@entity1 minority leader @entity0 is certain the @entity4 website 's tech problems wo n't affect the sustainability of the @entity4 , but very few in @entity7 are stepping up to second her motion a startup venture recruiting people for a one - way , 43 million mile trip to live on @entity13 has generated more signatures than all the @entity4 health insurance plans combined			1
just 712 people in @entity17 have enrolled in the state 's new health insurance exchange , despite $ 9 million in outreach , advertising and other @entity23 expenses paid for by the federal government			1
the entire state of @entity26 has yet to register a single person , according to sen. @entity28			0
( ' @entity30 how many people have signed up ? ' asks one cheeky blogger			0
' @entity32 : it 's a round number ! ' ) a @entity35 medical correspondent has found that the online @entity4 system , which was reportedly first tested just days before its oct. 1 launch , is now spontaneously deleting some @entity39 ' passwords			1
the website itself , according to @entity42 , includes pilfered source code but excludes a required copyright notice required by its author			0
with $ 394 million in contracts in the rear - view mirror , the @entity47 administration has an online white elephant on its hands that has n't worked as advertised			1
@entity52 , an @entity53 commentator best known for a series of racy ' naughty @entity56 ' photos that circled the internet in 2010 , confessed on thursday that she was ' embarrassed to admit ' she once worked for the company that created the federal government 's @entity4 website			1
is the @entity4 officially the most dysfunctional and disaster - prone launch in history ? @entity64 , which suddenly has time on its hands after weeks of shutdown and debt - armageddon liars poker , is about to ask some tough questions			1
and in the blue corner sits @entity4 , the much - ballyhooed health - care - for - all project whose official numbers are a closely guarded state secret			2
but unofficial numbers from firms that track the data independently suggest that the nationwide total is somewhere south of the @entity13 colony 's successes			0
the online analytics firm @entity104 released an analysis this week that determined just 36,000 people registered for @entity4 through the federal government 's @entity75 website during its first week of operation			1
( sources inside the @entity111 put that number at 51,000 when they spoke with @entity113			0
) and the 14 states that run their own enrollment websites – 15 if the @entity7 is included – are slowly adding their own figures to the total			0
the @entity118 , a consultancy whose influential @entity120 briefing has provided day - to - day totals , puts that number at 42,000 – although critics point out that it 's incomplete			0
only a few states have published their own totals , and most of those announcements have been full of qualifications and caveats			0
the @entity132 learned wednesday that @entity111 anticipated signing up 500,000 @entity39 per month , beginning in october , although the agency has denied that project , articulated in a departmental memorandum , was a hard target			2
president @entity47 is ' not happy ' with the rollout , @entity1 press secretary @entity137 said thursday in what might be the understatement of the week @entity17 's health insurance exchange has corralled just 712 new customers , despite $ 9 million in @entity23 and outreach expenses designed to attract taxpayers to the new system @entity150 , for instance , a state of 5.88 million people , had processed 1,121 applications as of oct. 11			1
@entity153 's program claims to represent 11,684 people , but that 's only after factoring in ' family members , children and other dependents ' of the actual applicants			0
@entity160 ( 100,000 ) , @entity7 ( 25,000 ) and @entity161 ( 13,000 ) have reported their numbers in a similar fashion , announcing how many people will benefit from newly contracted coverage instead of how many completed applications have been filed			0
families of four , for instance , would inflate those numbers by 400 per cent			0
still - larger states like @entity171 are not publishing definitive numbers at all , instead tweeting web - traffic totals and the number of applications its residents have ' started			0
' @entity17 , with 712 successful @entity4 enrollees as of thursday , according to @entity178 , has another problem to contend with : its website can accept applications , but it 's not capable of collecting any payments			1
gov. @entity183 , the @entity184 's biggest cheerleader , has n't addressed the possibility that even those few @entity17 will change their minds when the bill comes due			2
slow - walking : president @entity47 has n't mentioned his signature legislative achievement since the debt - limit debate reached its crescendo , preferring to look forward to immigration and farm - bill fights instead @entity17 gov. @entity183 is one of several @entity195 pols who were ubiquitous in the run - up to the @entity4 launch date , but hard to find in public since the disappointing numbers started to trickle in an embarrassed @entity52 made an on - air ' confession ' thursday on @entity53 , saying that she had worked for @entity201 , the main contractor behind @entity4 's troubled main website with the @entity47 administration cowering and late - night talk show hosts doing a brisk business in @entity4 jokes ( ' today @entity47 changed his slogan from " yes we can " to " perhaps we could try			1
ca n't promise anything , " ' said @entity210 ) , the @entity1 is saying only that the president is ' not happy			0
' and @entity64 , fresh from its epic debt - limit standoff , has begun to engage			2
@entity1 minority leader @entity0 said thursday that even if the @entity4 insurance exchanges ' enrollment mechanisms continue to be failure - prone through the holidays , the program itself must be allowed to continue without delays			2
' no , no – it has nothing to do with the programmatic part			0
it 's about technology , ' she insisted when asked about the impact of non-functioning websites and frustrated consumers on the public - policy part of @entity4			2
the part that won and lost hundreds of elections			0
but it 's the technology that is making headlines now , including one at the @entity234 that screamed about the @entity111 failing to road - test @entity75 ' until a week before launch			1
' @entity111 secretary @entity236 made time for @entity237 on @entity238 , but his pointed barbs have her scrambling to avoid testifyign before @entity64 about the disastrous @entity4 website ' normally a system this size would need 4 - 6 months of testing and performance tuning , not 4 - 6 days , ' a source on the inside of the project said			1
' the actual system requirements for oct. 1 were changing up until the week before			0
' and a former employee of @entity201 , the company behind the website – the same firm that now has former employee and @entity53 pundit @entity52 ' embarrassed ' – said ' requirements came late ' from the bureaucrats who ' dictated the design , especially the sign - up - before - viewing - plans , and there was absolutely not enough time for testing			1
' @entity201 's parent company was shown the door by health officials in @entity264 in september 2012 , after it missed deadlines in three straight years related to the province ’s online medical registry			2
but the @entity47 administration had already awarded the firm a $ 93.7 million contract in late 2011 to complete work on @entity75			1
and two years later , @entity274 reports , the value of that contract has grown to almost $ 292 million , nearly $ 200 million of which has already been paid			1
all told , according to a @entity277 report published in june , the administration doled out $ 394 million to dozens of companies for work related to setting up the health care exchanges nationwide			1
the @entity281 will likely dig into the administration 's high - tech bungling on october 24 , when it convenes a hearing on the website implementation that bears the ominous title , ' unprepared or @entity287 ? ' @entity111 secretary @entity236 , who said monday on @entity289 that she 's unaware of how many @entity39 have enrolled in @entity4 , has told the committee that she wo n't testify			1
' @entity291 had time for @entity237 , and we expect her to have time for @entity64 , ' countered committee chairman rep. @entity294 , a @entity297 @entity296 , in a statement on thursday			2
' either the administration was not ready for launch , or it was not up to the job , ' @entity294 said			0
' the president and top officials were quick to boast the number of visitors to @entity75 , but they have since gone silent , refusing to disclose even basic enrollment figures			2
' ' the rollout has been a complete mess , beyond the worst case scenario , and yet those administration officials responsible have indicated they will not be available to testify next week			0
