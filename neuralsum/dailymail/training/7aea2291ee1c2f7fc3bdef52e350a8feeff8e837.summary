claim : @entity0 , the chief executive of @entity1 , today said that an @entity3 investigation into energy companies increased the risk of blackouts the boss of @entity9 's largest energy company today warned that the country could face blackouts thanks to an investigation into the @entity14 suppliers			1
@entity0 , chief executive of @entity1 's parent company @entity1 , suggested the probe would deter investment in infrastructure and delay the construction of new power stations			1
his claim was met with a furious response from consumer groups , which accused mr @entity0 of ' unnecessary scaremongering ' and added : ' there 's no immediate prospect of the lights going out			1
' energy secretary @entity28 insisted that more than a dozen new infrastructure projects were in the pipeline and blamed the @entity14 for failing to invest enough in their own power supply resources			0
the regulator today announced that it has asked the competition authority to launch a comprehensive probe into @entity1 and its five main rivals			1
the investigation was prompted by @entity3 's findings that the energy firms have quadrupled their profits in the past four years as customers became reluctant to switch suppliers			1
mr @entity0 told the today programme on @entity45 that the inquiry , projected to take two years , would make companies and investors reluctant to commit to major infrastructure projects , putting @entity9 's energy supply in jeopardy			1
asked if there was a possibility of the lights going out , he said : ‘ we hope they wo n’t but there is an increasing risk			1
' a lot can be done in terms of demand management , but building new gas - fired power stations does take four years and that ’s the time pressure that we are now up against - and we ’ve just added another two years onto this			0
profits : @entity1 , owned by @entity1 , has seen its profits rise over the past few years bills : the cost to customers has risen from £ 1,095 to £ 1,232 over a four - year period ' the concern of this inquiry is that unfortunately , to do it thoroughly , is going to take two years			2
this happens at a time when we ’ve already had five years of uncertainty , from an investment point of view , in terms of putting through electricity market reforms			2
' so the big concern is whether we ’ll have a further two - year period of no investment at a time when @entity9 ’s energy security is a matter of increasing concern			1
’ mr @entity0 expresses fears that the investigation would force @entity1 to split its infrastructure and supply arms , suggesting that the possibility would deter the firm from investing in power generation			1
' it 's an inevitable consequence because the risk of investing in that space – because you might have to divest in a couple of years - has gone up , ' he said			2
the energy boss told @entity101 that @entity9 would be reliant on foreign countries for 70 per cent of its gas by 2020 thanks to the depletion of @entity107 reserves			2
last month , @entity1 chairman @entity108 warned that public opposition to the big energy firms could cause blackouts , saying : ' i think it is immensely damaging , not just for @entity1 , but for the nation - i think the reputation of @entity9 as a place in which to invest is under threat			1
' defence : @entity28 said mr @entity0 was ' absolutely , totally wrong ' and predicted a robust future for energy @entity0 , whose father was chairman of @entity122 , is an @entity123 - educated oil executive who became chief executive of @entity1 in 2006			1
since starting at the firm , which owns @entity1 , his pay packet has risen to nearly £ 5million as @entity1 's profits have soared and customers have seen ever - increasing bills			2
he has been criticised for accepting a series of multi-million - pound bonuses at a time when recession - hit consumers were spending more of their income on gas and electricity			0
mr @entity0 owns three homes - a @entity140 town house , a @entity142 mansion and a holiday flat on the @entity143			0
last year it emerged that he had installed a second swimming pool in the grounds of his @entity148 house , using more energy to heat it than the average family uses in a year			0
he is not the first @entity1 official to threaten blackouts - last week , chairman @entity108 warned that public opposition could prompt the firm to cut back on investment in power generation			2
energy secretary @entity28 hit back at mr @entity0 's claim , blaming @entity1 for under - investing and insisting that other companies were keen to build new energy infrastructure			1
' he is absolutely , totally wrong and i can prove it , ' he told today			1
' we have 14 contracts for power generation over the next 15 years			0
what we are seeing in @entity9 is a big investment in energy			2
' it is true that companies like @entity1 are not investing as much as we might like them to but we are seeing independent energy generation firms like @entity173 coming in in their place			2
' mr @entity28 added : ‘ we ’re seeing record levels of investment in this country , only this week , we saw 14 final bids for our 15 - year contracts to build new power stations – biomass , offshore wind and so on			0
‘ we ’re actually seeing an investment boom			0
it is n’t simply from people like @entity1 , it ’s a lot of independent generators coming			0
' some of the @entity14 have pulled out , @entity0 ’s company pulled out of the @entity190 nuclear project but that ’s going ahead with @entity191			0
they pulled out of an offshore windfarm , @entity194 , but a @entity196 offshore wind company is going to build that			0
’ @entity198 , director of consumer policy at @entity199 , said : ' this is unnecessary scaremongering			1
we have over 10 per cent of gas plants mothballed , and the capacity auctions planned for later this year could help bring these back into use			0
' also , the life of 90 per cent of our nuclear generation fleet has been extended , so , while we will need new generation , there is no immediate prospect of the lights going out			0
' @entity3 claimed that the investigation announced today would ' give people more confidence ' by clarifying the regulatory environment			1
' the current market and political uncertainty is already creating concern among investors , ' a spokesman said			0
' the alternative of waiting to see the impact of our reforms would leave the prospect of a reference as a risk to investment for a longer period			0
chief executive @entity230 added : ' this will provide clarity to make sure the lights stay on for two years , five years , 10 years , even 50 years			0
