@entity0 is hoping his second game in goal for @entity3 turns out to be less traumatic than his first			1
the 25 - year - old , who chose @entity3 over @entity5 when @entity6 accepted bids from both two months ago , is hoping to keep his place at home to @entity10 tonight			1
his bow came last week and just happened to be against @entity5 , whose 3 - 2 victory saw two @entity3 defenders — @entity15 and then , just seconds from the final whistle , @entity17 — put own goals past him			1
@entity0 can only look on as @entity17 turns the ball into his own net to gift @entity5 the win the 25 - year - old keeper has had to wait for his chance at @entity25 , but hopes to keep his place for @entity10 ‘ it ’s a debut i wo n’t be able to forget , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m hoping this game will be more straightforward , a nice 1 - 0 and a clean sheet will do			0
’ those come rarely for struggling @entity3 , whose manager @entity30 spent most of last week engaged in a war of words with @entity33 , the midfielder he had insisted was too fat to be picked			2
‘ the whole team have been focused and it has n’t affected anyone at all , ’ insisted @entity0			2
@entity0 was unfortunate to concede three times on his debut , with @entity15 also scoring an own goal the former @entity6 keeper made a few good saves but was unable to do anything about all three goals that has n’t stopped @entity33 from being the butt of some dressing - room banter			1
‘ we ’ve had a few laughs here and there about it but @entity33 does n’t take anything to heart , ’ he said			0
@entity0 was part of the @entity6 team who were relegated two seasons ago and a return to the @entity58 with @entity3 is already a distinct possibility			2
but the man who was an unused @entity61 squad member in 2013 decided to take that chance instead of rejoining @entity63 , briefly his manager at @entity6			0
‘ a lot of people have asked how i could turn down a @entity68 team , ’ he said			0
‘ it was a tough decision , the toughest i ’ve had to make in football but with myself still being young , the main thing was playing games			0
’ @entity0 claims the issues surrounding @entity33 have not had any influence on the ' focused ' squad			0
