by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 14:31 est , 17 june 2013 @entity1 has urged men to be more open about their health problems in an attempt to tackle cancer			1
the @entity7 star , who is fronting a new charity called one for @entity9 , believes men should talk more about the disease and other illnesses			1
@entity1 , 64 , said : ‘ guys do n't talk about their health issues , unless they 've got a sprained ankle			1
he says he believes men need to be more aware of cancer and of their own bodies for more videos , please go to @entity22 ‘ we 'll talk about our injuries but we wo n't talk about our illnesses , so i think it 's time we do that			1
’ the actor said he was motivated to put his weight behind the charity after he learnt that friends had secretly coped with cancer without telling anybody			1
he said : ‘ when they started talking about it , i realised most guys do n't talk to other guys about what their medical conditions are - especially cancer conditions			1
‘ and most guys think the only cancer guys get is prostate cancer , or they look at tv and see it as basically a woman 's problem , but it 's not			1
‘ so i realised that we do really need to make men aware of the fact that cancer is a very serious thing for guys			1
’ @entity55 was founded by event organiser @entity56 to challenge men 's understanding of cancers and their tendency to have a more laissez - faire approach to their health			1
in recent weeks , @entity63 ( left ) has revealed that she had a double mastectomy to reduce her chance of developing breast cancer and @entity67 ( right ) spoke out about his battle with throat cancer all money raised will go towards the @entity72 in @entity73 to buy new mri scanners which will help with cancer diagnosis			1
in recent weeks , @entity76 has revealed she had a double mastectomy because she has a higher chance of developing breast cancer , and @entity67 has spoken about his throat cancer			2
asked what effect celebrities can have on people 's perception of the disease , @entity1 said : ‘ we 're just people who have interesting jobs , so people tend to look at us , or that fact that you guys [ media ] do shows , or you film us talking , allows people to hear our opinions about things , or sometimes , we 'll just expose stuff about ourselves , and that makes people go , “ oh , that 's sort of like us ”			2
@entity1 says that he tries to keep fit and to eat healthily			2
he also says he uses alternative medicines and visits acupuncturists ‘ i do n't know that what we say has more weight than anything else , but @entity76 's declaration and allowing people to understand that she did that will maybe get some other women or some other person to look at their bodies and go in and go , “ ok , well maybe i do need to do this too , or i need to get checked ”			0
‘ hopefully we have enough credence , or our earnestness about the things we 're talking about will make sense to people , or it reaches a greater number of people because we 're the ones saying it			0
‘ i just want people to be aware and get out there and do something			2
to understand their bodies and understand the quality of life for them and their families if they understand what 's going on , on the inside and the outside , because cancer is not just internal , it 's external too			2
’ @entity1 said he has an exercise and diet regime to make sure he keeps healthy			0
‘ i try and eat a certain way , and i try and exercise , ’ he said			0
‘ i do use alternative medicines , i go to acupuncturists , get massages , but i 'm old , so i need to have those things			0
‘ but the sooner you recognise how to take care of your body , the longer you 'll have that engine driving you , and the more you 'll be able to do for yourself and for other people because you are healthy and you 'll be a healthy example			0
’ he added : ‘ i stretch			0
i do n't necessarily get out and run			0
i ride a stationary bike for an hour , an hour and a half , two or three times a week			0
‘ i get on the big @entity148 ball , i 've got my @entity150 straps to use my own body weight to pull myself around			0
‘ push - ups , pull - ups and stuff like that , so i try to find a way to maintain a specific weight and a specific level of fitness that allows me to have a comfortable lifestyle , and not be achy , and , i guess , kind of old			0
