a quick search of @entity1 reveals there are , on average , more than 11 million photos of rainbows on the image sharing site at any one time			2
but one airline passenger appears to have captured the impossible by taking a shot that looks as if it ’s taken over a rainbow			0
flying through , or above a rainbow , is n’t possible because it is optical trick caused by light reflected and refracted in water droplets - but the effect these images create are still stunning			1
the colourful shots ( pictured ) were taken by @entity19 , 51 , as she flew over the @entity20			1
but ms @entity19 , from @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity21 said she did n’t realise she ’s captured the kaleidoscope of colours until she viewed the images later in the day the three shots were taken by @entity19 , 51 , as she flew over the @entity20			1
but ms @entity19 , from @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity21 said she did n’t realise she ’d captured the kaleidoscope of colours until she viewed the images later in the day			1
ms @entity19 was travelling from @entity27 to @entity28 and spotted an interesting cloud formation below			1
‘ i was passing time on our long flight and looked out the window to see hundreds of these little cotton - like clouds , ’ explained ms @entity19			2
a rainbow forms when light is reflected and refracted in water droplets in the sky , or in other liquids or surfaces			1
they appear as multi-coloured arcs , and are caused when sunlight hits water droplets in a section of sky directly opposite the sun. in one of ms @entity19 ’s images , the sun is seen behind the wing of the plane , opposite where the rainbow colours appear			1
rainbows can be full circles , too , but people typically only seen them as arcs			0
because they are formed by droplets above the ground , centred on a line from the sun to the viewer ’s eye , this means they are visible from a distance			0
this perspective can change depending on where the viewer is stood			0
this means it is not possible to ‘ fly through ’ a rainbow			2
‘ i noticed how shadows were cast on the @entity20 and thought it was such a beautiful scene i had to snap some shots			2
‘ when i saw the " rainbow " in the shot i was stunned - i 'd never experienced anything like it and i doubt i ever will again			0
‘ having not seen the rainbow with my naked eye , it was n't until i reviewed the images later that i saw [ it ]			0
’ ‘ at first i thought maybe it was caused by jet fuel vapour , or perhaps from the polarised window on the plane , but then another photographer friend of mine pointed out that the [ colours ] were beneath the clouds			2
‘ all my uncertainty faded and i knew i 'd captured something special			0

photography expert @entity162 from @entity163 told @entity164 that ms @entity19 ’s images were not a rainbow , and were caused by the polarisation of the airplane ’s window			1
the light from the sky illuminates the landscape and travels through the window , at which point it is partially polarised			0
the extent of polarisation depends on the angle from the sun , and is greatest at 90 °			0
airplane windows additionally have at least one layer of thick plastic , explained @entity182			0
a rainbow forms when light is reflected and refracted in water droplets in the sky			1
white light separates into different wavelengths , when they enter the drop , as red light is refracted by a lesser angle than blue			2
on leaving the drop , the red rays turn through a smaller angle than blue , producing a rainbow the production process , or strains within the window , makes the plastic slightly anisotropic , meaning its properties differ in different directions			0
optically , the window is what 's known as birefringent or double refracting			0
put simply , this means the window splits the light entering it into two rays , which are polarised and refracted at different angles			2
this causes the colours , or wavelengths , within the light to split .			2

shots were taken by @entity19 , 51 , as she flew over the @entity20
she was travelling to @entity28 when she spotted the cloud formation
the 51 - year - old said she did n’t spot the kaleidoscope of colours until later
rainbows are optical tricks caused by light reflected and refracted in water
this means it is impossible to fly through , or over , them
photography expert said colours were caused by polarising plane windows
