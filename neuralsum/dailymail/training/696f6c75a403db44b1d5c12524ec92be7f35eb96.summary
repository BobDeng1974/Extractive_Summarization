@entity2 , 20 , turned up out of the blue in @entity10 a year ago posing as a 17 - year - old who had lived in a forest with his father for years until the man suddenly died			1
' @entity15 ' told the authorities that he had lost his memory after burying his father two weeks earlier			1
he then lived in the city at the taxpayer 's expense for ten months , until he was exposed as a fantasist in june , when his photo was circulated around the world and he was identified by his stepmother from the @entity25			1
@entity26 had vanished from his hometown of @entity28 only days before his arrival in @entity10			2
@entity5 youth authorities confirmed they would sue him for at least £ 20,000 - the cost of his care and searches to find his family			2
@entity10 social services paid for bed and board , clothing and @entity5 lessons for the @entity41 - speaking @entity25			1
they also gave him a staggering £ 200 a month in pocket money			2
however , he has now disappeared again , and has not been seen in nearly three months			2
now neither his stepmother , his ex-girlfriend from @entity28 or the @entity5 or @entity25 police know where he is			1
his stepmother @entity48 told a @entity25 newspaper last week : ' a day after his unmasking he phoned me and asked if he could come home because he needed to rest			1
f course i said yes , you 're welcome			2
' he responded with the words : " i 'll call you tomorrow or the day after			0
" ' but i have heard nothing more			0
' i was assuming that he would show up one day on the pavement outside , but nothing			0
' @entity10 's youth authorities believed he might have taken up with a community of itinerant fruit pickers moving from village to village throughout the summer			2
but that work has come to an end now autumn has arrived			0
his stepmother added : ' i think he is still in @entity3 but i do n't know for sure			0
' there were rumours he was sighted in @entity28 , but @entity2 is smart enough to know that he would have problems if that was the case			1
' friends said @entity70 left home because of ' personal problems ' and to ' start a new life '			2
expensive : ' @entity15 ' was looked after for ten months after he walked into the city claiming to have lost his memory possessions : @entity70 said his mother had died when he was 12 and cut contact with family and friends schoolmates in @entity28 , however , spotted him on the news when the pictures were published around the world			1
his step - mother identified him and asked him to come back home - but she has no clue where he is now the service youth and the police of @entity90 suspect he is hiding in @entity10 and its surroundings			0
a district judge in @entity10 has issued a decree that he has to pay back the money but there is little chance of that happening while he remains on the run			0
' we have no idea where he is , ' said a @entity10 police spokesman			0
@entity105 spokesman @entity104 told @entity106 at the time : ' it was a really frustrating case and took up a lot of time			0
that will have to be paid for and that will eventually end up at his door			0
' accommodation : the tent which @entity15 was apparently using when he was in the woods left without a word : the house of the father of the ' forest boy @entity15 ' in @entity28 , the @entity25 ' it 's no longer a joke			1
if the story is made up then he deliberately took us for fools , and he could be liable for the costs			0

@entity131 said he had been living in a forest with his father @entity133 for five years after his mother , @entity134 , died in a car accident when he was 12 - but he insisted he did not know his last name or where he is from			1
