villagers have branded two council @entity2 trees the worst in @entity4 - ' and possibly the world '			1
the threadbare living firs prompted derision when they were planted in patches of grass in the @entity11 villages of @entity12 and @entity13			1
locals in @entity15 even set up a @entity17 campaign called ' embarrassment of @entity18 ! ' and adorned it with tinsel and baubles themselves			1
it 's just a waste of time			1
unless someone points it out you do n't even notice it ' one poster on the group suggested @entity12 had the ' worst @entity2 tree in the @entity4 / possibly the world '			1
five miles away in @entity13 , that village 's tree still has the only decoration sanctioned by cash - strapped officials - a solitary string of fairy lights			1
@entity54 , which has had to cut £ 142million from its budgets over five years , insisted the trees were a low - cost way of celebrating the festive season			1
the firs will not be ripped from the ground in january and will instead be left to grow , providing the villages with a larger tree each year			2
but that excuse did not prevent a backlash			0
@entity12 hairdresser @entity65 said : ' i thought the tree was a quite appalling			2
it 's normally about 7ft - this one just looks like the top of last year 's tree			2
@entity73 town : at one point , the fairy lights on the tree in @entity13 ( pictured ) did not even work holly insufficient : hairdresser @entity65 ( right ) is one of those who has decorated the tree in @entity15 , pictured left at night before it received a makeover by community - minded residents of the village ' we normally have a lot of flowers in the summer but there has n't been this year			1
i do think it 's nice that people have tried to sort it out a little bit , it 's gone some way making up for the state the tree was in			2
' cleaner @entity98 , 33 , added : ' we have a lot of pride in the area so to get something like this is appalling			0
how 's that for a merry @entity2 ? ' the way things are at the moment people need something to look forward to and that 's nothing to smile about			2
that 's not going to bring people closer together in a good way			2
it 's just going to bring people closer to complain			0
' in @entity13 locals are hoping for some homespun decorations in their village , too			1
@entity32 , 57 , said : ' at the moment the tree 's pathetic and got to be the worst anywhere in the @entity4			1
' it 's absolutely rubbish			0
it 's just a waste of time			1
unless someone points it out you do n't even notice it			0
it 's hiding behind the lamp post			1
' student @entity129 , 19 , added : ' it 's that small i thought somebody would nick it , but it 's not even worth nicking			0
it 's like a twig			0
' not everyone was a fan of the community spirit in @entity15 , however			0
@entity138 , 68 , said : ' they should have left it alone			0
they have made it worse			0
if you ca n't do it properly do n't do it			0
' a spokesman for @entity148 - run @entity54 said the trees were ' sustainable ' and ' designed to provide a tree for many years to come '			1
parish council minutes suggested the living trees cost around £ 1,600 each - compared to £ 2,000 each for temporary trees , a sum which would have to be paid again in full the next year			1
' as is widely accepted local authorities up and down the country are facing huge cuts to their budgets so are continually under pressure to find more innovative ways of working , ' the spokesman added			0
' by providing living trees as a one - off cost the trees can be re-used year - on - year without the additional costs attached to erecting and taking down a new tree every @entity2			1
a @entity54 spokesman said : ' by providing living trees as a one - off cost the trees can be re-used year - on - year without the additional costs attached to erecting and taking down a new tree every @entity2 ' @entity171 : locals decorated the @entity12 tree with their own baubles - but one said it looked even worse ' because they are recently planted they are small , but will obviously grow into @entity2 trees the whole community can enjoy			1
' as an aside community - minded locals have already started dressing the tree in @entity15 , which is bringing the community together at such a special time of year			2
' @entity13 resident @entity182 , 65 , had little time for the excuse			2
' the council should have planted that one and put another one up for this year , ' she said			0
' i have n't seen it lit but i doubt it will make much difference			0
' @entity54 was unable to confirm whether it or parish councils paid for the trees			0
