identical twins who were both diagnosed with breast cancer have become a medical rarity - @entity2 donated skin and fat tissue for her sister @entity5 's reconstruction on tuesday			1
@entity5 , 34 , had already received chemotherapy treatment , surgery to remove her right breast , and radiation previously , but this week her operation involved a second mastectomy , and reconstruction of both breasts			1
he sister , from @entity17 , @entity18 , stepped in and essentially had a ' tummy tuck ' , removing lower abdominal skin and fat tissue , which was transplanted to her twin to create a second new breast			0
@entity2 , left , and @entity5 , right , were both diagnosed with breast cancer within months of each other and have both undergone treatment and reconstruction surgery @entity2 had also already had a double mastectomy previously , recommended because her sister 's cancer was so aggressive , but she did n't need chemotherapy or radiation			1
she had reconstruction with implants after the birth of her second child last march			0
@entity5 was diagnosed first , in december 2011 , with triple - negative breast cancer , a hard - to - treat form of cancer whose growth is not fueled by hormones			1
when she was diagnosed with the cancer , she urged her twin to get tested , too , who was diagnosed with the same disease just a few months later			2
' you just do everything together , do n't you , ' the doctor told @entity2 before delivering the bad news that she , too , had the disease			0
when asked about donating her tissue to her sister , @entity2 said : ' it was n't a question , she did n't have to ask me			0
' @entity2 , left , her husband , @entity56 , their daughter @entity58 , @entity2 's identical twin @entity5 , husband @entity57 , and their son , @entity60 , at @entity5 's mother - in - law 's house in @entity64 , @entity65 @entity2 , left , holding her daughter , @entity67 , and @entity5 as they look at old family photos the college enrollment counselor said : ' having a twin is very like having a child			2
you would do anything for them ... in a heartbeat			0
' the first successful organ transplant was between identical twins in @entity79 in 1954 and involved a kidney			1
since then , identical twins have been involved in many other transplant operations , involving kidneys and other organs , bone marrow , and stem cells			1
but breast reconstruction between identical twins has only been done a handful of times ; @entity2 and @entity5 , a nurse , are among the youngest patients			1
identical twins are ideal donors because their skin , tissue and organs are perfect genetic matches , explained dr. @entity95 , chief of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the @entity98			2
and that eliminates the need for anti-rejection medicine , he said			0
@entity95 performed the twins ' surgeries on tuesday and both fared well			0
@entity5 at her mother - in - law 's house with her niece @entity58 , left , and son , @entity60 typically , breast reconstruction surgery involves implants and / or a woman 's own tissue , sometimes taken from the abdomen , thighs or buttocks			1

since then , identical twins have been involved in many other transplant operations , involving kidneys and other organs , bone marrow , and stem cells			1
but breast reconstruction between identical twins has only been done a handful of times ; @entity2 and @entity5 , a nurse , are among the youngest patients at 34			1
identical twins are ideal donors because their skin , tissue and organs are perfect genetic matches but @entity5 is among women who do n't have enough extra tissue ; plus , radiation treatment damaged tissue near her breasts			1
so @entity2 offered to be a donor			0
@entity5 said her sister 's sacrifice , ' just so i can feel better about myself ... is really humbling			0
' with their blonde bobs , sparkling brown eyes and easy , engaging smiles , the twins are clearly mirror images of each other			0
discovering breast cancer in identical twins is n't unusual because of their exact genetic makeup , @entity95 said			1
with twins , there 's also often a ' mirroring effect ' , with breast cancer developing in the opposite breast , he said			1
that 's what happened with @entity5 and @entity2			0
while their mother died from colon cancer last year , there was no family history of breast cancer			2
@entity5 was nine months pregnant when she was diagnosed and her son was born a week later			2
soon after she started treatment , chemotherapy , surgery to remove her right breast , and radiation			0
@entity2 was diagnosed with a very early - stage cancer in her left breast a few months after her sister			2
' @entity5 was more upset than i was during my diagnosis , and likewise , when she was diagnosed i was a mess , ' @entity2 said			2
the twins have always been extremely close , sometimes speaking in unison or completing each other 's sentences			0
but now , @entity5 said , ' i feel closer			0
her tissue is over my heart			0
