by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the campaign to force the @entity4 to change their name gained a significant victory on wednesday when the @entity7 canceled the team 's federal trademarks because their nickname is ‘ disparaging of @entity12 ’			1
the 2:1 decision by a patent office administrative tribunal follows years of criticism of the @entity17 club by @entity12 and others who say the name is derogatory			2
the ruling does n’t mean the @entity4 have to change their name , but the team – and the @entity22 - now lose their ability to protect the trademark and the decision opens the door for others to legally use the logos and the name			1
’ the case - filed on behalf of five @entity12 - was brought against the team by @entity42 activist @entity41			2
‘ i am extremely happy that the [ board ] ruled in our favor , ’ she said			0
‘ it is a great victory for @entity12 and for all @entity12			0
we filed our petition eight years ago and it has been a tough battle ever since			0
‘ i hope this ruling brings us a step closer to that inevitable day when the name of the @entity17 football team will be changed			0
’ @entity4 owner @entity51 has steadfastly refused to change the team 's name - citing tradition the team will however be allowed to retain trademark protection during an appeal , which can be reviewed by a federal court			1
@entity60 senator @entity59 ( @entity61 ) has lauded wednesday 's result as a ‘ landmark decision			1
’ ' this is not the end of this case , but this is a landmark decision by the @entity7 that says that the @entity22 team here in @entity17 does not have patentable name , and that this is an offensive term not patentable by the patent office , ’ said senator @entity59 , speaking on the @entity75 floor on wednesday			1
' i hope that all the business decisions at the team will be made with the understanding that this is no longer a business case and we will get off of this slur of a name that we need to change			0
' @entity4 owner @entity51 has steadfastly refused to change the team 's name , citing tradition , but there has been growing pressure in recent months including statements from president @entity89 , lawmakers of both parties and civil rights groups			1
as of last month , 50 @entity60 senators had written ‘ scathing ’ letters to @entity22 commissioner @entity95			1
in october , president @entity89 spoke out against the team ’s name : ‘ if i were the owner of the team and i knew that there was a name of my team - even if it had a storied history - that was offending a sizable group of people , i ’d think about changing it			2
’ the decision opens the door for others to legally use the @entity4 ' logos and the name the decision by the @entity35 is similar to one it issued in 1999			1
that ruling was overturned in 2003 in large part on a technicality after the courts decided that the plaintiffs were too old and should have filed their complaint soon after the @entity4 registered their nickname in 1967			2
the new case was launched in 2006 by a younger group of @entity12 , and was heard by the board in march of last year			0
the group argued that the @entity4 should lose their federal trademark protection based on a law that prohibits registered names that are disparaging , scandalous , contemptuous or disreputable			1
one of driving force behind the case is a 69 - year - old grandmother and longtime @entity130 activist named @entity131			0
@entity60 senator @entity59 ( @entity61 ) has lauded the result against the @entity4 as a ' landmark decision ' in high school , she was inspired to fight against what she describes as ‘ racist stereotypes in @entity60 sports ’ because of an @entity140 native @entity60 activist named @entity141			1
‘ he made a personal cause of getting rid of the mascot ' @entity146 ' at the @entity140 , ’ @entity131 told @entity142			0
‘ most of the @entity147 in @entity148 could n't stand ' @entity146 ' and we called him the dancing idiot			0
he was always portrayed by a white guy in @entity12 costume			0
’ @entity146 was eventually banished by @entity140 president @entity153 in 1970			0
according to @entity131 , activists involved in the effort to eliminate @entity130 mascots always viewed the @entity4 football team as ‘ the worst ’ offender .			2

the ruling does n't mean the @entity4 have to change their name , but the team – and the @entity22 - now lose their ability to protect the trademark
