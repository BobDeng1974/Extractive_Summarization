by @entity0 men who read tabloids are more likely to check their testicles for signs of cancer than broadsheet readers , new research shows			2
single men are also less likely to recognise the signs of testicular cancer than men who are in a relationship			1
and , office workers are the least likely to check their testicles for lumps			0
new research shows that two thirds of men do not know the signs of testicular cancer the survey of 3,000 men , carried out for the male cancer charity orchid , aimed to find out how ‘ in touch ’ men are with their testicles			1
it revealed that a worrying two thirds of men in the @entity27 do n’t know how to recognise the signs of testicular cancer			1
it also showed that one in three men would tell their mother or partner if they found a lump , but that they would n’t visit a gp			1
finally , it revealed that men in @entity36 are the least ‘ ball aware ’ of all men in the @entity27			1
orchid chief executive @entity38 said : ‘ awareness of testicular cancer has significantly improved over the past few years , but these findings also illustrate that a large percentage of men are still not taking proactive steps to protect themselves			1
‘ if caught early , testicular cancer can be 98 per cent curable			2
sadly , our findings indicate that men who delay seeking an early diagnosis may risk the disease spreading and a poor response to the treatment			0
men who read tabloids , and those who are in a relationship , are more aware of testicular cancer than single broadsheet readers ‘ we were particularly surprised to find that men working in an office environment with easy access to the internet , social media and a wide range of health information tools were least likely to check themselves			1
‘ we ’re calling on men across the @entity27 to take a few minutes to learn about how to carry out simple self - checks and to recognise the early warning signs and symptoms , regardless of their work obligations and pace of life			1
the earlier they act , the better the outcome			0
’ the most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in one of the testicles			2
other symptoms can include pain in a testicle , a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum , a dull ache in the lower abdomen , fatigue and generally feeling unwell			0
testicular cancer is uncommon and usually only affects men between the ages of 15 and 44			2
it only accounts for one per cent of all cancers that occur in men			0
it is one of the most treatable types of cancer with more than 85 per cent of men with early stage testicular cancer being completely cured			2
even in cases where the cancer has spread outside the testicles , there is about an 80 per cent chance of complete cure			0
to encourage men to be more informed about male cancers , @entity104 is launching its confidential , freephone @entity107 on april 7 , 2014			0
