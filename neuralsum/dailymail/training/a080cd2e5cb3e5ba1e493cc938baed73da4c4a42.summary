by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 07:44 est , 25 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:52 est , 25 december 2013 making rape victims relive their harrowing assault can actually help them come to terms with their ordeal , a new study has found			1
after the so - called ' exposure therapy ' , 83 per cent no longer had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder			1
they fared much better than girls who got only supportive counselling - 54 per cent in that group no longer had ptsd after treatment			2
the results are the first evidence that the same kind of ' exposure ' therapy that helps combat veterans haunted by flashbacks and nightmares also works for traumatised sexually abused teens with similar symptoms , the study authors and other experts said			1
@entity29 , from the @entity30 , said that 83 per cent of those who took part in the study no longer suffered flashbacks and nightmares as a result of the therapy			1
girls who got exposure therapy also had much better scores on measures of depression and daily functioning than girls who got conventional counselling			1
' it 's common to think that offering just comforting words and encouraging traumatized youngsters to forget their ordeals is protecting them , but that 's ' not doing them any favours , ' said @entity30 psychologist @entity29 , the lead author			1
she said that approach can be harmful because it lets symptoms fester			0
@entity53 developed a two - part treatment known as prolonged exposure therapy and has studied its use in treating post-traumatic stress disorder			1
it involves having patients repeatedly tell their awful stories , and then visit safe places that remind them of the trauma , or take part in safe activities they 'd avoided because of painful reminders			2
' many are actually relieved that somebody wants to hear their story , ' @entity53 said			0
the @entity70 health system uses the treatment for vets with @entity15			2
@entity53 's previous research has shown this approach works for adult rape victims , and it is used in some rape crisis centres			0
' exposure therapy ' : victims had to repeatedly tell their stories and then visit safe places that remind them of the trauma her new study was published tuesday in the @entity83			1
sixty - one girls aged 13 - 18 were recruited at a rape crisis centre in @entity86			0
they had been raped or sexually abused , sometimes repeatedly , often by a relative			0
all had been diagnosed with @entity15			0
the researchers provided four days of prolonged exposure training for counsellors at the centre and two days of supportive counselling training			0
the teens were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of counselling or prolonged exposure therapy from the counsellors			1
sessions lasted an hour or 90 minutes			0
at first , most were very upset talking about what had happened			0
but by telling and re-telling their trauma , ' they get a new perspective of what happened , ' @entity53 said			0
the research into ' exposure therapy ' was carried out at the @entity30 ' they get used to thinking and talking about the memory and realizing that it was in the past , that it 's not in the present anymore			1
' eventually , ' the story becomes remote and they get closure , ' she said			0
benefits of the prolonged exposure therapy lasted throughout a one - year follow - up			2
a @entity83 editorial said many therapists are reluctant to try the treatment with kids because of concerns that it might worsen symptoms , but that the study should raise awareness of the benefits			2
the study ' should allay therapist concerns about any potential harmful effects of exposure , ' said editorial author @entity132 , a psychologist at @entity133 in @entity134 and a specialist in ptsd treatment in kids			1
the distress that comes with reliving the trauma usually dissipates within a few sessions , and is essential to recovery , he said .			0

@entity30 psychologist @entity29 carried out the study on young *female* victims of sexual assault
subjects had to repeatedly describe what happened to them and visit places that reminded them of the assault
after ' exposure therapy ' , 83 *%* no longer had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder
it is similar to the treatment given to army veterans suffering from ptsd
