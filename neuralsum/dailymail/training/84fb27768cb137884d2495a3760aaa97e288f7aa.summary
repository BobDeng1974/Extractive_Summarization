by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 ’s biggest reshuffle of his top team was beginning to unravel last night amid a storm of controversy			1
two of his key appointments quickly ran into trouble and there was anger over a plan to compensate ousted ministers with knighthoods or major international jobs			1
with @entity17 claiming ‘ the wheels were coming off ’ , the government scrambled to deal with the apparently unforeseen consequences of the ministerial shake - up			1
furore : @entity3 's controversial reshuffle of his top team has already been hit by a storm of controversy as the backlash intensified , it emerged that : * mr @entity3 ’s candidate to be @entity31 ’s next @entity30 commissioner , lord hill , is to be forced to sell his shares in a lobbying company following warnings his appointment could be vetoed ; * his replacement as leader of the @entity39 , @entity38 , was downgraded below full @entity41 status – to the fury of fellow peers ; * four senior figures who left the government are to be given knighthoods or honours in what @entity17 said was an ‘ abuse ’ of patronage ; * the ousted @entity38 , @entity51 , is being lined up to replace former labour cabinet minister @entity52 in a senior @entity54 post			1
conflict of interest : @entity3 has nominated lord hill to be the @entity31 's next @entity57 commissioner in @entity59 , @entity31 officials said @entity60 would divest himself of what is thought to be a significant shareholding in the lobbying giant @entity63 , which is owned by mr @entity3 ’s @entity65 neighbour and constituency chairman @entity66			1
the move , expected to be confirmed today , follows claims that the firm ’s activities in @entity59 might represent a conflict of interest for @entity60			1
at home , there was uproar in the second chamber after it emerged its new leader , @entity38 , will not be a full member of the @entity41 – unlike predecessors for the last 112 years			1
@entity17 suggested the expected awards for departing ministers indicated mr @entity3 was using the honours system and patronage to reward those who went quietly in tuesday ’s ‘ @entity86 ’ , which saw 11 men leave the government			1
mr @entity51 , who has previously joked that he once told the prime minister he wanted to be made ‘ governor general of @entity91 ’ , is expected to be nominated to succeed @entity52 as the @entity54 ’s under - secretary general for humanitarian affairs			1
the appointment would make mr @entity51 , who was the prime minister ’s boss at the @entity95 , the most senior @entity31 figure at the world body			1
the appointment is made by the @entity54 secretary general , but usually after a signal from a world leader			1
mr @entity3 smoothed the path for @entity52 ’s appointment in 2010			1
sir @entity104 , the former @entity31 ambassador to @entity105 , was appointed to the post on the say - so of @entity107 , who gave him the job as a consolation prize after he declined to appoint him as ambassador to @entity112 or as head of the @entity114			1
ex-ministers who will get knighthoods include @entity117 , who left his post as international development minister , and @entity120 , a @entity114 minister and former @entity122 minister			1
they are in line to be made knights @entity124 and @entity126			2
@entity127 , who was solicitor general , will also be knighted			2
veteran cabinet minister @entity128 , 74 , who also left the government this week , is being chosen for one of the highest honours in the land , becoming a companion of honour			2
this elite order is conferred by the sovereign for service of national importance , independently of @entity139			2
soon to be a sir ? @entity117 recipients include astrophysicist @entity142 , naturalist @entity143 and former prime minister @entity144			2
@entity17 did not question mr @entity128 ’s expected honour , given his service to politics for more than 40 years			2
but @entity148 , the party ’s @entity149 spokesman , said of the other awards : ‘ dishing out hush - hush honours and gongs as golden goodbyes , just to keep his sacked ministers happy , also shows how weak @entity3 is			2
the wheels have all come off @entity3 ’s reshuffle			0
‘ he was so busy organising photo ops that he ’s forgotten to do the real work			0
’ @entity17 mp @entity160 said : ‘ i ’ve nothing against long - service medals , but using honours to sweeten the pill of dismissal is an abuse			0
’ challenged in the @entity167 , mr @entity3 said : ‘ i make no apology for saying that i think in public life we should recognise public service , people who have worked hard , people who have contributed to our nation , contributed to our government			0
that is a good thing to do			0
’ @entity139 refused to confirm any of the expected gongs			0
but a source said : ‘ these sorts of awards have long been conferred for public service			0
in terms of @entity120 , he played an absolutely pivotal role in the @entity122 which was one of the greatest events of modern times			0
’ in 2012 , several ministers who lost their government positions were similarly recommended to the @entity189 for honours and @entity17 made like recommendations while in power			0
she was dubbed the queen of the @entity139 ‘ catwalk ’ after being pictured sashaying to @entity195 in the cabinet reshuffle			0
yesterday , however , employment minister @entity197 chose a rather more practical look as she visited a bicycle factory with @entity3			0
gone were the high heels and glamorous split skirt			0
instead , she and the prime minister showed they were getting straight down to business with matching steel toecapped trainers provided by the @entity208 factory in west @entity209			0
miss @entity197 laughed off any suggestion she was unhappy at being referred to as a catwalk queen in media coverage , telling reporters it was ‘ fine if it inspires girls to go into politics ’ .			0
