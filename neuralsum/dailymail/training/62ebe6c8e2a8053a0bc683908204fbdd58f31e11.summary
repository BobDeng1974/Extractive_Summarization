' the judge said that , had @entity1 applied for a firearms licence , he may well have been granted one because of his background in farming			2
@entity1 , a former joint master of the @entity28 , kept a gun under a bale of hay and was given ammunition by friends so he did n't have to go to a gunsmith to purchase it ' instead , you kept that gun under a bale of hay in an open barn where it could have been discovered and used by anyone for any purpose			1
' the offence is aggravated because , when it was discovered , it was found with 40 rounds of ammunition of the correct calibre for that gun			2
' the ammunition was given to you by people rather than you having to go to a gunsmith to purchase it where you would have had to produce a licence to show you were entitled to possess it			2
' the judge added : ' it could have fallen into the hands of children and one can only imagine what could have happened if they chose to experiment with it			0
' judge @entity34 said that @entity1 , of previous good character , continued to lie to police about owning the gun until his dna was discovered on it			2

mrs @entity14 said : ' first of all , i heard the sound and then i had a horrendous pain in my leg and hip , and i realised what had happened			1
