the tomatoes , which are genetically modified , have been developed by @entity6 scientists but grown in @entity9 , where restrictions on @entity12 products are looser			1
the crop has been produced in an @entity15 glasshouse and is set to yield 2,000 litres of tomato juice , for use in research which could pave the way for it to be sold in shops			0
@entity3 tomato juice with extra health benefits is on the way to @entity6			2
the tomatoes , which are genetically modified , have been developed by @entity6 scientists but grown in @entity9 , where restrictions on @entity12 products are looser the first 1,200 litres will soon be shipped to @entity20 , where scientists from the @entity22 will work on getting authorisation for commercial sale			1
the purple tomatoes have anti-inflammatory effects and were shown to slow down cancer in mice			1
they also have double the shelf life			0
the colour of the tomatoes is derived from high levels of anthocyanins , compounds normally found in blueberries , blackberries and other deeply coloured berries			1
professor @entity39 , from the @entity22 , said : ‘ we want to explore a way for consumers to benefit from our discoveries , as we are finding there is a demand for the added health benefits			0
’ research so far has been funded by the @entity48 and through the @entity22 ’s strategic funding from the @entity50			0

the tomatoes and juice are set to be used to study the effects of a high anthocyanin diet on cancer , cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases			2
other varieties , high in compounds such as resveratrol normally found in red wine , are already being used to develop skin care products in collaboration with @entity83 company @entity82			0
bringing the juice to the food market will require regulatory approval and may be possible in as little as two years in @entity87			0
the @entity22 said tomatoes have been chosen for the trial because they are the world ’s most popular fruit .			0
