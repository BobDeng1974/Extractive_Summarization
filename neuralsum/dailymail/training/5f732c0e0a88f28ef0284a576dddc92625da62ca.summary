by @entity0 a young @entity2 entrepreuner has developed a modular home that can be assembled in just three weeks for as little as £ 59,000			1
the @entity4 was set up by 22 year - old @entity5 , a @entity6 graduate , with help from her father @entity8 , who has been working in the construction industry for over 25 years			1
the homes are constructed as modular timber units at their manufacturing base in @entity13 and then transported to the customer ’s plot of land for completion			1
the houses can be one bedroom or two			2
parents with grown - up children underfoot will be glad to know they can also act as an affordable first home			1
the original inspiration for a @entity32 came from staff accommodation cottages on rural estates			0
ms @entity5 , who lives in a @entity32 herself , said : ' the @entity45 can handle the entire process from applying for planning permission , to the construction of the house , to installation of services , providing the customer with a self build experience for those who do not have the time to actually self build			1
the original inspiration for a @entity32 came from staff accommodation cottages on rural estates the company claims ' @entity32 ' is ideal as a second building on a property for an elderly relative , holiday home or for downsizing living room : unlike prefabs of yesteryear , the home is designed to last ' the construction time of a @entity32 takes only eight weeks , with just three weeks work spent on the customer ’s plot of land			1
with the majority of the construction time spent at their manufacturing base , the whole process is made easy and stress - free for the customer			0

constructed in large numbers in factories , they were then moved to pre-plumbed concrete slabs where they could be put up in less than a day			2
for more than 150,000 homeless , bombed - out families in @entity38 , these two - bedroom prefabs were designed as a temporary solution - though some still exist as permanent residences today			0
