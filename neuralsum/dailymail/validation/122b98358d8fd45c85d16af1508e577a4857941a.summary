@entity0 and @entity1 have reached the point of no return			1
the two @entity3 are making their final journeys from the @entity6 prison where they have been incarcerated for 10 years to a sinister island they have only heard about called nusakambangan			1
there , a firing squad awaits			0
the grim news that there is now no hope of escaping their fates hangs heavily over the family and friends of the two men			0
for @entity0 , 31 , and @entity1 , 34 , leaving the @entity6 prison which has been their home for the last 10 years brings only fear and dread			1
the streets were lined with police and riot officers the ringleaders of the @entity47 heroin drug ring were given a @entity49 blessing ceremony at @entity50 and said their farewells			1
neither man has been outside the walls of @entity29 since shortly after their arrest on april 17 , 2005 , when @entity0 , then a 21 - year - old , was seated on a @entity56 flight which was ready to depart @entity58 airport			0
he was not carrying any drugs			0
@entity1 only enjoyed a few more hours of freedom , his arrest coming later on the same day at the @entity62 in @entity63 along with @entity47 mules @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity67 , who had 11.8 ounces of heroin strapped to their bodies			1
a set of scales were also in the room			0
one way trip : the two condemned men will fly to @entity76 in the central @entity78 town of @entity79 from @entity81 airport which they have not seen for the ten years since the @entity47 were arrested with 8.3kg of heroin in a doomed attempt to smuggle the drugs from @entity86 back to @entity3 the ' bandara ' or airport ( pictured ) in the coastal mining town of @entity89 in central java , which is the port for @entity92 and where two @entity94 military planes carrying @entity95 and @entity1 and an escort of armed police will land today shattered : a devastated @entity98 ( above , right ) leaves @entity29 prison earlier this week after visiting her 34 - year - old son @entity100 as hopes faded for legal appeals to prevent him and @entity0 being executed by firing squad @entity105 , the older brother of death row inmate @entity0 is pictured leaving @entity50 in the @entity6 capital of @entity107 this week ahead of his brother 's transfer to the central @entity110 for execution on ' death island ' all men plus the remaining mules apprehended at the airport with heroin strapped to their bodies were interrogated and taken into custody at the @entity6 police headquarters before being transferred to @entity29			1
@entity0 and @entity1 left the prison never to return , escorted by 22 heavily armed men dressed in black , the members of the @entity123 special police mobile brigade			2
handcuffed and walked by figures with their faces hidden by masks and balaclavas , the pair were placed into armoured personnel carriers , called @entity130 or @entity131 , and driven on the 30 minute trip to @entity58 airport			0
unlikely to have got the chance to see the makeover the airport terminal has undergone since they flew into @entity6 in 2005 , the men were driven across the tarmac to a small prop plane			2
they are being escorted every step of the way by the @entity123 officers			0
after takeoff @entity0 and @entity1 got their last glimpse of @entity81 and @entity50 before the aircraft turned west on its 700km journey			1
the flight , expected to take two hours , took them over the mountainous terrain of eastern @entity39 , with its volcanoes and verdant highlands , then down to the coast and tiny rundown @entity76 in @entity89 , which normally opens only between 7am and 2pm and services mostly flight schools			0
@entity158 territory : this is the port of the coastal town of @entity89 in @entity39 which , in contrast to the @entity49 culture of @entity6 , is @entity158 and broadcasts on loudspeakers the five daily calls to prayer prison officers share a joke outside a shop at @entity171 port in @entity89 as preparations took place for the executions of @entity3 @entity0 and @entity1 at nearby @entity176 island from the air strip to @entity171 , the quay to @entity89 's port , it is a 16km drive through a sprawling industrial city , but the @entity94 police are expected to transfer the @entity3 to nusakambangan in another armoured vehicle			1
although the @entity3 will miss the bustle of @entity89 's streets , which are choked with trucks and hundreds of noisy motorbikes , their transfer into a different culture will become obvious when they hear their first @entity191 call to prayer broadcast on loudspeakers			2
a police vehicle drives onto the deck of the @entity196 , one of the police boats which ferry prisoners , prison guards and family members to nusakambangan 's seven island prisons the police station on @entity92 where @entity0 and @entity1 are due to be taken on wednesday 72 hours ahead of their executions this coming weekend death island : nusakambangan island , as seen on this map , lies off the southern coast of @entity39 , and has been a prison island since the early 1900s with several abandoned facilities among its rubber plantations and rain forest and seven operational jails including @entity217 , to where @entity0 and @entity1 are being transferred this jetty on @entity92 where the @entity3 ' families will be taken to so they can visit before the two men face the firing squad , most likely just after midnight on saturday one of the towers on @entity224 , which is now the point of no return for condemned @entity3 drug smugglers , @entity0 and @entity1 densely overgrown with tropical rainforest , nusakambangan is 121 square kilometres and its seven operating prisons can not be seen from the shore opposite			1
they will then be taken to @entity217 or ' stone ' prison , one of the island 's seven facilities , where prison officers have been preparing special isolation cells to separate @entity0 and @entity1 and others due for execution from the remainder of the prison population			2
family members will have to take the police boat to nusakambangan to visit them			0
the journey takes around 30 minutes and ends at @entity247 dock			0
@entity94 military patrol the waters off nusakambangan island in the security build up in the days leading up to the execution of up to ten drug traffickers , including the @entity3 , a @entity255 woman and men from @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 the steps leading up from the jetty at @entity262 on @entity176 island , where the two @entity3 are due to be taken to today , arriving from @entity89 the entrance to @entity267 's @entity266 prison , the supermax facility on nusakambangan or ' death ' island which lies off @entity39 in @entity86 this is the interior of @entity217 prison , where @entity0 and @entity1 will be housed is isolation cells ahead of their executions just after midnight on saturday night an inmate is pictured in @entity217 prison on nusakambangan , one of the older facilities built during @entity279 colonial times , and which will house the two @entity3 for 72 hours before they face a firing squad this recreation of the firing squad aired on @entity94 television in january just before the execution on @entity285 of foreign drug traffickers			1
' @entity287 ' means death by execution in the @entity94 language this eerie hooded figure , featuring in a tv recreation , is meant to represent the condemned prisoner who has the choice of wearing a blindfold while being executed by firing squad in @entity86 they will then be allowed visits from their families and a minister of religion of their choosing as they are given 72 hours to live before they face the firing squad			1
they will also be asked to make a written final request , which may be in the form of making a statement about their guilt or innocence			0
they will also be allowed to choose whether they are strapped to the execution post when they face the firing squad and whether they wish to be blindfolded or not			0
over on the mainland in @entity89 , @entity0 and @entity1 's relatives will be staying in hotels and accompanied throughout the town by @entity3 embassy staff from @entity321 or @entity81			1
ambulances take the bodies of executed prisoners from ' death island ' to the mainland an ambulance with the body of executed prisoner , @entity279 @entity329 , at @entity89 in january arrives off the police boat from nusakambangan island in central @entity39 to thedock of @entity333 port meanwhile , preparations for the executions are gathering apace , with ambulances due at the @entity338 on friday , where they will be marked in alphabetical order , a to @entity341 , for the ten prisoners due for execution and labelled with the condemned person 's names			1
the ambulances will be loaded each with a coffin and taken to the island			0
at 10pm on saturday , @entity89 mortician @entity349 will board the police boat with the coffins and be ferried to nusakambangan			0
the families of @entity0 and @entity1 may also go to the island if they wish , but mr @entity349 told @entity354 that they would probably remain at @entity247 dock while the executions took place			2
around midnight @entity0 and @entity1 will each be taken to a clearing on the island to face a firing squad of twelve men armed with rifles , nine of which are loaded with blanks and three with live rounds			2
