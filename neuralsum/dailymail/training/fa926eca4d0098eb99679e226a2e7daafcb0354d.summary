by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 02:02 est , 16 may 2013 reaching the peak of @entity2 is the ambition of many an adventurous soul			1
but these daredevils decided that - instead of climbing to the summit of the world 's tallest mountain - they would skydive over it			2
the skydivers were flown to the dizzying height of 18,000ft above sea level before leaping from the helicopter and hurtling towards the @entity14 at stomach - churning speed			1
on top of the world : these daredevils completed a mind blowing skydive over the summit of @entity2 , the world 's highest peak plummet over the summit : the trio of skydivers form a ring as they hurtle towards the earth at astronomical speed only 30 skydivers per year complete the mind - blowing leap , soaring over the mountains before deploying their parachutes and floating back down amid spectacular scenery to the drop zone , located 12,350ft above sea level			1
the thrill - seekers are equipped with specalised military and parachute equipment - including oxygen masks - to complete their high - altitude adventure			1
@entity43 , 35 , from @entity44 , said : ' we do two groups every year with maximum of 12 - 15 members in each group			2
each diver does maximum of three jumps			0
' it takes approximately 30 minutes to complete the whole jump from taking off to landing , ' he said			0
' if we break the whole experience down , it will look somewhat like this : 15 - 25 minutes for flight , 40 - 60 seconds of free fall and 3 - 5 minutes for landing			1
' the jump takes place over the @entity2 region of @entity64 , specifically the @entity66 and @entity67 region			0
' ready to take the leap : a solo jump over the @entity2 summit costs a staggering £ 16,500 leap of faith : the skydivers jump from the mind - boggling height of 18,000ft above sea level the price tag alone is enough to get pulses racing , with a solo jump costing £ 16,500 and tandems a heart - stopping £ 23,000			1
this year marks the 60th anniversary of sir @entity81 becoming the first human to reach the summit of @entity2			2
mr @entity43 added : ' @entity84 has come a long way since the first test operation held in 2008			0
@entity2 adventure : the skydivers were flown by helicopter to a height of 18,000ft above sea level over the summit of the mountain going ... the skydivers are kitted out with specialised military equipment for the risky jump going ... a skydiver teeters on the edge of the helicopter soaring over the snow - capped peaks in the @entity14 gone ... the skydiver leaps from the helicopter to make the stomach - churning jump ' the team 's enormous level of dedication , and the people , has made @entity84 one of the most amazing adventures in the @entity14 today			1
' it gives extreme adventure buffs the opportunity to get their names into the international record books and make history by taking a leap with the @entity84 team			0
' the suits worn by the skydivers during the @entity84 are locally made by a young @entity121 based @entity64 entrepreneur , @entity122			0
@entity123 : only 30 divers per year brave the @entity2 jump scenery : tandem skydivers hurtle towards the earth against the stunning backdrop of the snowy @entity14 dizzying : the skydivers leapt from the helicopter hovering above the summit of the world 's tallest mountain the red , blue and black skydiving suits , which are tailored in a small workshop , help support the local community and create jobs for the local residents			1
in may 2008 , @entity141 and @entity142 made history by being the first people to jump over @entity2			2
. their first two attempts at 6.30am and 8am failed due to the weather which forced the pair to wait another agonising hour before taking off			0
the pair eventually jumped from the stomach churning height of 16,000ft , landing safely at @entity66 and cementing their place in the record books .			0

thrill - seekers plummeted from 18,000ft above sea level over @entity14
