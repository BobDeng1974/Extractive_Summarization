weekend gales in @entity9 have knocked the deathly steel figure parallel to the ground , but mercifully still in his elevated roof - top position with scythe and bail on stumps intact			0
the @entity3 weathervane at @entity1 has been bent almost 90 degrees by high winds the famous weathervane has been at @entity1 since 1926 after it was presented to the @entity20 @entity3 is one of the famous features at @entity1 and staff are working to get it back to normal staff from @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , which owns lord 's , are working with specialists to restore it to its original position as soon as possible			1
lord 's is due to host its first game of the season on sunday , april 12 when @entity35 entertain @entity36 in the @entity37			0

@entity3 was given to @entity20 in 1926 by the architect of the @entity49 , sir @entity50			2
during @entity51 , it was wrenched from its original perch when it became entangled in the steel cable of a barrage balloon			0
staff set about trying to repair and restore @entity3 to it 's original glory @entity3 tweeted to say he had been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment it was reattached to the top of the @entity49 where it sat until 1996 when it was relocated to the @entity5			2
the symbolism of the figure derives from @entity65 ( 3 ) of the @entity66 : ' after the call of @entity3 , the bails shall be removed from both wickets			2
' but he has , as his name indicates , moved with the times - and tweets these days on behalf of @entity1 , including an update on his latest mishap			0
the two posts read : ' news : i 've was felled by high winds last night ! ouch ! ' apologies for my poor grammar in the previous tweet - but i 'm not feeling my best after being damaged last night ! ' @entity3 later tweeted : ' i 've been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment asap			1
