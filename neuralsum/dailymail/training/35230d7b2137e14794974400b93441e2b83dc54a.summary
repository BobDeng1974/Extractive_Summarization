by @entity1 reporter published : 13:11 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 16:53 est , 14 august 2013 three years after an unidentified woman was found abandoned in a hospital waiting room , wearing only an adult diaper and hospital gown , @entity3 authorities have found her name and the person who was supposed to be caring for her			1
unable to speak , and with no identification , @entity11 's history had been a mystery until monday			1
her carers had scant clues to go on - just a cesarean section scar and initials in her dentures			0
however , a tip off finally led authorities to ms @entity11 's carer @entity22 , of @entity23 , @entity24 , who faces charges of claiming more than $ 25,000 in ms @entity11 's social security checks over the past three years			1
named : three years after she was found abandoned , @entity11 has her identity back ' it 's a relief to me			1
it 's been a long , drawn - out process over something that should have never happened , ' @entity31 agent lieutenant @entity30 , who has led the search for ms @entity11 's identity , told @entity38			1
because ms @entity11 , who was named @entity39 by the medical staff who have cared for her since she was found in august 2010 , did not have an identity she was unable to qualify for @entity42			1
the 68 - year - old woman , who had a urinary tract infection , and was dehydrated and malnourished when she was found , has built up medical bills of $ 200,000 in the past three years			1
although she can barely speak and has learning disabilities , ms @entity11 did try to help authorities identify her			2
' she would attempt to write her name and , what 's really sad , is , if you look at the name she was attempting to give the hospitals here in @entity56 , it matches the name and the signature that she would give to the adult day care she stayed at in @entity24 , ' @entity50 district attorney @entity49 said			0
from the start , officers feared someone may still be claiming her social security checks			0
@entity65 , 59 , became the disabled woman 's carer in 2009 and , according to authorities , filled out the necessary paperwork to take charge of ms @entity11 's social security benefits			1
' @entity65 did acknowledge receiving @entity11 's money and using it to obtain goods and services that never went to @entity76 , ' lieutenant @entity30 said			1
' for three years , she has reaped the benefits of those checks			0
' charged : @entity22 , who was @entity11 's carer , is accused of identity theft he added that @entity65 , who has been charged with identity theft , denied being the one who abandoned ms @entity11 , who weighed less than 90lb when she was found at the hospital			1
ms @entity11 was originally cared for by @entity65 's sister until she died , which was when @entity65 took over , according to @entity38			2
the search for ms @entity11 's identity was further hampered because her short blonde hair had been dyed dark and she was wearing large , black - rimmed glasses when she was found , possibly in an attempt to disguise her			1
several newspaper articles and television reports featured her story , and fingerprints and dna were taken in the hope of finding a match in missing persons databases			0
' the @entity101 probably followed over 1,000 to 2,000 leads , ' ms @entity49 told @entity103			0
in 2011 ms @entity11 's new carers spoke to the press again in the hope of finding her relatives , or anyone who knew her			1
although they did not provide immediate leads , her story was carried on various social media sites , which eventually helped identify her			0
after a tip off to @entity112 , a non-profit volunteer group , officials were able to match ms @entity11 with her medical and financial records			2
@entity65 has since been charged and is being held on a $ 50,000 bond			2
ms @entity49 said she now wants to pass @entity115 , which would give more security to those with learning disabilities and help stop others being treated in the same way as ms @entity11 was			2
' we have to do something about this			0
we have to be able to identify these people and we have to make sure the benefits that are provided to them are actually going to them and for them , ' she said			0
ms @entity11 's court - appointed guardian , attorney @entity129 , is thrilled that her identity has been revealed			1
protection : district attorney @entity49 wants to introduce laws to protect patients like ms @entity11 ' a lot of compassion has poured out for this lady			2
many have expressed an interest and concern in finding her identity so she would n't have " @entity143 " on her tombstone			0
that 's not going to happen now , and we 're delighted , ' he said			0
ms @entity11 , who has no living relatives , will remain in her nursing home			0
' our intent is for her to remain in our care until or unless her circumstance changes , ' mr @entity129 said			0
' she will stay with us , but now with her rightful name			0

tip off leads police to @entity11 's carer who is accused of *cashing* $ 25,000 in welfare checks
