by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 12:47 est , 18 october 2012 an motorsport driver has had a miraculous escape after a horrific collision in his ' @entity5 ' race car			1
@entity6 was testing the @entity7 when he went to overtake a driver in his @entity10 race car			1
but the other racer clipped the @entity7 , triggering a high - speed crash			1
the open - top racer was tipped onto its side and then smashed into the tyre wall before landing on its wheels during the the practice session of the 15th annual @entity20 in @entity21			1
however , he is being protected by the car 's roll hoops which held firm - preventing a near - certain catastrophe			2
@entity33 , 30 , emerged from the wreck unscathed and , after a short trip to the hospital , was released having suffered no injuries			0
the impact generated a staggering @entity52 , according to the team 's telemetry system			1
@entity33 later described the incident as " not the best of practice sessions " , after being sent " for a bit of a ride "			0
@entity60 - like : the @entity61 can travel up to 185mph he added : " luckily , the guys built a very strong car			2
while the damage looks to be bad in photographs , the car took the impact quite well			0
" we have all the spare parts to fix it and we have an excellent crew that got to work straight away and had the car stripped down remarkably quickly			0
" the @entity7 has been dubbed the @entity5 because of its unconventional design looks and stealthy paintjob			0
as the vehicle flips over , t he driver is put at risk - but while the accident is unfortunate , it is a good real - world safety test @entity6 throws his hands up in the air after the accident , which began and finished in the space of a few seconds the accident happened at this point , as @entity6 and a competing @entity10 collided ( just off camera ) it is fitted with a tiny 1.6 - litre turbocharged engine which develops 300bhp - giving the lightweight vehicle blistering performance			1
before the crash , the @entity7 was 4/10ths of a second slower than the fastest @entity94 car in sixth place on the timesheet for the afternoon session			0
it had set a fastest time of 1 minute , 13.686 seconds for the 2.54 - mile @entity21 circuit			1
@entity99 , @entity7 director , said : " the most important thing is that @entity6 is ok after a very nasty accident			1
" the guys are working very hard and will do everything they can to get back on track tomorrow			2
" what i am most pleased about is that while the car obviously passed all the virtual and actual @entity109 crash tests prior to running at @entity20 , we 've unfortunately tested the car in real world incidents twice now and in both cases the car has done its job in protecting the driver			0
" we 'd rather not do it again but we 've certainly shown the concept works and it is very safe			0
" the @entity20 , which takes place between october 17 -20 , is a 1,000km endurance race with 42 entries taking part			2

@entity6 experienced @entity52 of force as his helmet was dragged across the ground at race - track in @entity21
