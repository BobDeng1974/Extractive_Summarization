this was the moment a rare and unique echidna breeding ritual was caught on camera at @entity3 in @entity4			1
these super cute five echidnas , also known as spiny anteaters , were captured taking part in what is known as ' trailing '			1
female echidna @entity9 released a hormone called pheromone that attracted her boyfriend @entity13 along with his other friends @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity23 keeper @entity22 told @entity33 says once the echidnas mate there is a 90 per cent chance of pregnancy			2
he said : ' we are hoping @entity9 might have laid an egg because she has gone underground			2
' this behaviour is also very rare and i believe we might have been the first zoo to capture the footage in the world			0
' keepers at @entity3 in @entity46 have high hopes for @entity9 because the last puggle to be born and survive was @entity49 and she was born in 1987			1
mr @entity22 said @entity50 did give birth to a puggle two years ago but it sadly died very young			2
if @entity9 does fall pregnant it will take her 21 days after mating to lay an egg and she will push the egg into the pouch			1
experts do n't know why the echidnas follow one another in the ' bumper to bumper style ' in the wild , female echidnas can have up to 10 male echidnas following behind them in the breeding process it will take another 10 days till the egg breaks and the baby will lick on the mum 's rich secreted milk			1
despite being an @entity73 icon mystery still surrounds why the echindas when it comes to their unique mating rituals			0
once the females release their hormone the male echidnas suddenly start trailing behind the female bumper - to - bumper style , all in a line			1
mr @entity22 says the zoo keepers call it ' echinda train ' where the group follow one another round nose to bum trying to mate with the female			1
' it 's a mystery why echidna females find their mate by taking them on an arduous journey through the bush			0
they 're a bit of an enigma			0
these echidnas , also known as spiny anteaters , were captured taking part in what is known as ' trailing ' ' one theory is that the males trail the female until she eventually grows tired and stops walking			1
' she will then accept the first male in line as a mate			0
' another thought is that the female recognises the compatibility of the male through smell			0
it 's possible that she is waiting for the right male to be directly behind her			0
' it 's not necessarily the strongest but the smartest who wins the opportunity to breed			0
' in the wild , female echidnas can have up to 10 male echidnas following behind them			1
taronga zoo echinda keeper @entity22 said : ' they 're a bit of an enigma ' @entity22 currently has four females and five males involved in a breeding program			2
the echindas , which live on average to about 40 years old , only breed during winter - june to september - and their breeding intensifies on the winter soltace on june 21 , according to mr @entity22 who has worked with them for 12 years			0
he added : ' it is notoriously hard to breed echidna offspring in human care , with only approximately 25 echidnas ever bred , and nearly all of those were in the last 10 years			2
' they have grabbed me , they are intelligent , fascinating and a pleasure to work with , @entity50 is my favourite			0
' a zoo spokesman said : ' echidnas are not endangered in the wild , however loss of habitat has contributed to reduce the distribution of echidnas in @entity73			0
' it 's important that keepers continue to try to breed echidnas in the event that numbers in the wild become critically low			2

five echidnas were filmed *partaking* in the breeding ritual called ' trailing '
the female releases a hormone which attracts males in the area
experts do n't know why the echidnas follow one another round for up to 10 hours a day in a ' bumper to bumper style '
the ritual went on for a week and a half before @entity9 finally mated with @entity13
@entity4 's @entity3 have high hopes for the breeding programme and think @entity9 could be pregnant with a puggle
