by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 11:39 est , 5 october 2012 free birth control dramatically lowers rates of abortions and teen births , a large study has revealed			1
only 6.3 teenagers in every 1,000 given their choice of contraception get pregnant , compared with 34 per 1,000 nationwide , @entity7 researchers found			1
if birth control options were free , one abortion in 79 to 137 could be prevented , said scientists in @entity14 , @entity15			1
new outlook : the rate of teen pregnancies was found to drop dramatically if women were given access to free contraception ( picture posed by model ) more than 9,000 women in the city were given their choice of contraceptive at no charge			1
when cost was not an issue , women flocked to the most effective contraceptives - the implanted options , which typically cost hundreds of dollars			1
the women , many of them poor or uninsured , experienced far fewer unintended pregnancies , reported dr @entity37 of @entity38 in @entity14			2
there were much lower rates of abortion , too , with 4.4 to 7.5 abortions per 1,000 women in the study , compared with 13.4 to 17 abortions per 1,000 women in the @entity14 region and 20 per 1,000 women nationally			0
the findings of the study published in the journal @entity49 come as millions of @entity7 women are beginning to get access to contraception without copayment under president @entity57 's health care law			1
sound investment : women given their choice on contraception gravitate towards the most effective methods , researchers found women 's health specialists said the study , which ran from 2008 to 2010 , foreshadows that policy 's potential impact			1
@entity68 , director of women 's health policy at the @entity70 , said : ' as a society , we want to reduce unintended pregnancies and abortion rates			2
' this study has demonstrated that having access to no - cost contraception helps us get to that goal			2
' dr. @entity78 , president of the @entity79 , described the results as an ' amazing improvement '			0
' i would think if you were against abortions , you would be 100 per cent for contraception access , ' he added			0
the law requires that contraceptives be available for free for women enrolled in most workplace insurance plans from january 1			2
controversial issue : millions of women are beginning to get access to free contraception under president @entity57 's new healthcare plans the policy is among the law 's most contentious provisions because it exempts churches that oppose contraception but requires religious - affiliated organisations , such as colleges or hospitals , to provide the coverage for their workers			1
the @entity104 and many conservative groups say that violates religious freedom , and @entity109 presidential nominee @entity108 has voiced similar criticism			0
this week , a federal judge in @entity14 dismissed a lawsuit challenging the contraception mandate			0
nearly three dozen similar suits have been filed around the country			0
@entity116 of the conservative @entity117 suggested contraceptive use can encourage riskier sexual behaviour			0
' @entity57 administration 's contraception mandate may ultimately cause more unplanned pregnancies since it mandates that all health plans cover contraceptives , including those that the study 's authors claim are less effective , ' she said			1
nearly half of the nation 's six million - plus pregnancies each year are unintended			1
an estimated 43 per cent of them end in abortion , with low - income women far more likely to have an unplanned pregnancy than their wealthier counterparts			0
' we should n't have , in my view , a tiered system where the women with money can get family planning and the women without can not , ' said dr @entity37 , noting that 39 per cent of the women in his study had trouble paying basic expenses			0
about half of unplanned pregnancies occur in women who use no contraception			2
as for the other half , condoms can fail and so can birth control pills or other shorter - acting methods if the woman forgets to use them or ca n't afford a refill			1
@entity159 is an implant inserted under the skin of the arm that prevents pregnancy for three years			0
an @entity164 , a tiny t - shaped device inserted into the uterus , can last for five to 10 years , depending on the brand , although it can be removed			0
only about five per cent of @entity7 women use long - acting contraceptives , far fewer than in other developed countries			1
dr @entity37 believes this is because insurance has not always covered the higher upfront cost to insert them and because doctors do not always mention these methods			0
three - quarters of his study participants chose an @entity164 or @entity159 , and a year later 85 per cent were sticking that choice - compared to about half who had initially chosen the pill , patch or other shorter - acting method .			2
