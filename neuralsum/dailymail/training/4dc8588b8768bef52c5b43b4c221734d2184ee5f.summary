the team behind the latest awareness campaign from breast cancer charity @entity2 ! were forced to find billboards away from roads - to make sure drivers were n't distracted by bare chests on show			1
the images , which will also appear in magazines and shop changing rooms , feature ' real ' women who posed topless in support of the new # whatnormalfeelslike campaign			1
but sites for the billboards , unveiled today at sites in @entity20 and @entity21 , had to be carefully chosen in order to make sure they did n't breach advertising rules - or cause car crashes			1
above , a woman in @entity20 photographs the image prominent : the photographs , seen above on a massive high - resolution screen in @entity20 , show the bare breasts of 24 ' real ' women			1
each image is printed with a word the women used to describe their chest the photographs , which are broadcast on massive high - resolution screens , show the bare breasts of 24 ' real ' women			1

guidelines set by industry watchdog the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) say that bare breasts should not be published in a sexualised manner			1
they should also not be published in a way that might offend children , or someone 's religious beliefs			1
as it was not an advert , the @entity2 ! campaign fell into a ' grey area ' when it comes to the code , explained @entity60 , executive creative director at advertising agency @entity61 that worked on the project			2
according to codes set by the @entity65 ( @entity46 ) , advertisements must not contain anything that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence			2
this includes publishing adverts that may be deemed ' overly sexual ' , and those which may offend someone for religious reasons			2
particular attention is paid to children , and the code urges advertisers to consider whether their publication exposes children to ' irresponsible sexual imagery '			2
while there is no set definition as to what this means , examples given by the @entity81 - the body that enforces the @entity46 code - include images of posing seductively in lingerie or skimpy swimwear			2
in addition to these rules , charities are also given rules to stop them taking advantage of people 's kindness and impulse to give to charity			1
but the team still had to work to minimise the offense it could potentially cause - and therefore the risk of the advert being removed			2
ms @entity60 told @entity104 : ' the challenge here is that outdoor advertising is a broadcast medium so it is difficult to restrict who will see a particular billboard site so the risk was that the level of nudity could be deemed unsuitable for children or cause offense on religious grounds			1
' it therefore became a careful balancing act between avoiding causing offense but getting the important empowerment message to our audience			0
' the conflict led the team to seek out locations in three shopping centres , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity131 - which launches next month			0
based on data provided by media company @entity133 , the team found the spots had high footfall of their target audience , young women , and were visited by very few children			0
crucially , the locations are all also away from the road so they avoid distracting drivers			0
the billboards are the second phase in a nationwide campaign			1
the first set , launched last october , featured seven bare - chested women , photographed by @entity148 photographer @entity147			0
while the first campaign received @entity46 approval , the team were cautioned in featuring images of bare breasts across billboards			1
it is not yet known whether the @entity158 received any complaints relating to the new billboards			0
founders : @entity162 and @entity163 , pictured last year , who founded @entity2 ! after @entity162 was diagnosed with breast cancer breast cancer awareness charity @entity2 ! was founded by 28 - year - old identical twins @entity162 and @entity163 , after their lives were turned upside down in 2009			1
that year , when the girls were just 23 , @entity162 was diagnosed with breast cancer - eight months after first going to her gp with concerns about lumps she was finding in her painful chest			1
dismissed as ' hormones ' and told she was far too young to have the disease , the cancer went undiagnosed for so long that it spread to her spine , only finally diagnosed when the twins ' no - nonsense mother marched @entity162 to the doctor and demanded to be taken seriously			0
raising awareness : @entity162 , left , and @entity163 at a @entity2 ! flash mob organised in @entity131 in 2012 @entity162 was – and remains – at stage four , the most advanced type of cancer			2
there is no stage five			0
straight away , @entity162 was thrown into a routine of radiotherapy , five months of chemotherapy , and yet more radiotherapy			0
she made it her mission to encourage other young people to get to know their breasts so that they might be able to detect any lumps early			0
@entity162 and @entity163 founded @entity2 ! just one month after @entity162 ' diagnosis			0
@entity162 is not cancer free – and perhaps never will be			0
but she ’s keeping as well as she can , being treated at the hospital each month .			0
