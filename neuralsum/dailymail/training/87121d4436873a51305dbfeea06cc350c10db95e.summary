@entity0 : encounters with twentieth century legends by @entity3 the cast list of this collection is sumptuous — great film stars in their glory days , legends of the boxing ring , disc jockeys , racing jockeys , writers of plays and unforgettable songs , and a few unclassifiable men who became as rich as @entity17 and @entity18			1
what they had in common was being interviewed by the renowned journalist @entity3 , who explains that his boyhood in a one - horse town in @entity24 was lit up each week by a trip to the cinema , or ‘ bioscope ’ as it was called			1
it gave him a hunger to get among the @entity32 stars , and so he did — treating them as equals			1
by then he was in showbusiness , too , as a lyric writer of albums and musicals			2
with many hits to his credit , he finally struck gold by writing the @entity43 lyrics to @entity44			2
the renowned journalist @entity3 had a hunger to get among the @entity32 stars , and so he did — treating them as equals some interviews are short , but his mere brush with @entity49 in his mean old age is enough to set the nerves jangling with dislike			1
so does the immature ignorance of a youthful @entity54 , who had toured @entity24 without noticing that apartheid was a problem			1
‘ the coloured servants do n’t really mind it			2
they get their food and board — why should they mind ? ’ he says			2
as @entity3 observes , ‘ an image caught on the run can reveal more than a studio portrait ’			1
it is not only what his subjects say but the way @entity3 frames the snapshot that is revealing			1
many of the interviews were done in the @entity71			2
in that period , he and i saw each other most weekday nights during theatre intervals , as rival reviewers for @entity78 newspapers			0
@entity3 had a brush with @entity54 who toured @entity24 without acknowledging that apartheid was a problem we never discussed the show we were seeing — an unbreakable convention among critics , although actors believe that we conspire			1
so i have reason to respect @entity3 ’s shrewdness of eye and humorous sharpness of prose			1
in those days , before tape recorders , we interviewed using the @entity94 — a notebook and pencil , an observant eye and a good memory			2
nowadays , especially on tv , interviewers are noisy , interrupting , pestering people with questions — drawing attention to themselves			2
a good interviewer gets past the persona that stars always have ready - prepared			1
he is looking for ore , and once he ’s scented it , knows when to wait — giving his subjects confidence , to the point where they ’ll confess what they usually keep hidden			2
a stunningly brilliant example of this is @entity3 ’s session with the notoriously hard nut to crack , @entity118			1
invited to take a ride in @entity120 in @entity118 ’s @entity121 , @entity3 notes how ‘ indestructibly boyish ’ the star looks in his 50s			1
but why did he walk out on so many wives ? at one point @entity118 says mysteriously : ‘ we spend our time getting away from mother only to return to mother			1
’ @entity3 notes this opening			1
@entity118 is given to ‘ @entity131 ’			1
he says that even the most dedicated mother does not return love consistently			0
‘ there are periods of rejection , so the child grows up afraid of love			0
’ @entity3 notes : ‘ he seemed to be talking about himself			1
’ @entity118 goes on : ‘ eventually you ’re afraid to give yourself fully to the beautiful blast of love			1
when love walks in , most people walk out			0
’ @entity3 lights a cigarette and waits			1
@entity118 continues : ‘ i would n’t let myself feel love , and because of that i could n’t give it			1
every man ’s first love is his mother			0
my own mother was brunette so i used to marry blondes			0
’ @entity118 was a notoriously hard nut for @entity3 to crack these reflections are interrupted by the park - keeper tapping on the window : ‘ lady asks if she can take yer snap			1
’ go ahead , says @entity118 — the lady was blonde			1
the ageless boy of 56 and the boy from the @entity24 bush sit on companionably			1
@entity118 says he thinks he ’s broken the patterns of blondes and failure			1
he drops @entity3 off at his home			1
‘ i ’m going to @entity163 to see my mother			0
in parting he adds : ‘ i ’m really getting to enjoy my mother ’s company ’ , and glides away in his car			0
there are plenty more nuggets , often in a brief flash			0
@entity18 talks ‘ in a slow solemn undertone , like a family doctor preparing to give bad news to the relatives ’			0
on the frequency of his divorces , he told @entity3 : ‘ a rich man ’s wife begins to feel useless			1
servants do all the work			0
and i could n’t spare women a lot of time			0
’ @entity184 , too , found women dispensable			0
‘ they now want total independence , yet they still want to be taken care of , do n’t they ? they insist on careers but i do n’t find career women particularly happy , do you ? they ’re taking on pressures they are not built to withstand			0
soon they ’ll be dying sooner than we do ! ’ at this mr @entity184 ‘ chortled into his iced drink ’			0
@entity196 would probably have agreed			0
‘ men are stronger characters than women , not so muddled in their thinking			0
i have a brain more male than female , ’ she told @entity3			2
ever - genial @entity202 , when asked if there was anything he disliked about himself , studied his nails and said : ‘ i know exactly what i dislike			2
i am too busy trying to get everybody to like me			0
so i am thought shallow and artificial			0
’ he studied his nails some more			0
and shallow , ’ he repeated softly , leaving us to wonder — was he ? ever - genial @entity202 , when asked if there was anything he disliked about himself , studied his nails and said : ‘ i know exactly what i dislike			2
i am too busy trying to get everybody to like me			0
so i am thought shallow and artificial			0
’ perhaps the saddest piece is on @entity214 , the master impersonator			0
@entity215 , who knew him , ‘ or rather did n’t know him ’ , for 20 years , says : ‘ he saw himself as an unfinished man who had been denied a definable personality			0
people wanted more from him than he could give , and nothing — and nobody — satisfied him for long			2
’ throughout , @entity3 remains a courteous , self - effacing observer of the games others play			1
i wo n’t say his book is unputdownable			0
its attraction is that it is putdownable			0
it should be savoured a brandy glassful at a time — ideal for sipping at the bedside .			2
