@entity0 believes he is playing behind the best three strikers in world football at @entity3			1
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 all scored for their respective countries over the weekend			1
@entity6 scored on his first start for @entity10 in a year , while @entity4 grabbed @entity12 's winner against @entity13 and @entity14 was on target for @entity16 against @entity17			1
' i want to try to score more goals			0
it 's very important for the midfielders , ' he told the november issue of @entity38			2
' i like assists as well and i think we have maybe the best three strikers in the world here in @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6			0
' @entity51 [ @entity52 ] , @entity50 [ @entity49 ] , @entity47 [ @entity48 ] , @entity45 [ @entity46 ] , fletch [ @entity44 ] and me are all going to help them try to score , and if i score of course i 'll be very happy			0
' @entity0 has scored twice for @entity3 , including in the 4 - 0 win over @entity56 last month @entity0 is currently out injured having fractured his rib in @entity3 's win over @entity59 last month @entity3 may have three gems in @entity4 , @entity14 and @entity6 but they will have to go some to match the original @entity30 - @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 - in @entity3 fans ' affections			1
@entity0 has no set return date yet as he continues his recovery but is keen to figure in forthcoming games against @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
' the @entity72 is a great league , ' he says			0
' it 's a very quick league , non-stop and great spectacle for the fans			0
that 's good because sometimes in other countries there are more teams that try to keep the ball in their end of the pitch but in the @entity72 you will see a lot of goals			2
' it 's a difficult league , there are tough games against @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity70 and @entity92 ; it 's a great challenge			0
