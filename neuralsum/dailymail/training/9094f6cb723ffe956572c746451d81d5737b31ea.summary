@entity1 health officials on tuesday released a draft of long - awaited federal guidelines on circumcision , saying medical evidence supports having the procedure done and health insurers should pay for it			1
the @entity10 guidelines stop short of telling parent to get their newborn sons circumcised			2
that is a personal decision that may involve religious or cultural preferences , said the @entity10 's dr. @entity17			2
but ' the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks , ' added @entity17 , who oversees the agency 's programs on @entity23 and other sexually transmitted diseases			1
new evidence : the @entity10 guidelines stop short of telling parent to get their newborn sons circumcised these are the first federal guidelines on circumcision , a brief medical procedure that involves cutting away the foreskin around the tip of the penis			1
germs can grow underneath the foreskin , and @entity10 officials say the procedure can lower a male 's risk of sexually - transmitted diseases , penile cancer and even urinary tract infections			1
the @entity10 started working on the guidelines about seven years ago , when a cluster of influential studies in @entity47 indicated circumcision might help stop spread of the @entity50 virus			1
' the benefits of male circumcision have become more and more clear over the last ten years , ' said dr. @entity53 , a @entity54 researcher involved in one of the african studies			0
but the guidelines are important , because the rates of newborn male circumcision have been dropping , he added			2
the guidelines are being published in the federal register tuesday			0
for the next 45 days , the @entity10 will receive public comment before finalizing them next year			0
they are likely to draw intense opposition from anti-circumcision advocacy groups , said dr. @entity65 , a @entity66 physician who worked on a circumcision policy statement issued by the @entity68 in 2012			1
' this is a passionate issue for them and they feel strongly that circumcision is wrong , ' said @entity65 , a professor of pediatrics at the @entity74			0
the @entity10 guidelines largely mirror the pediatrician group 's statement , but the @entity10 's document incorporates more research and comes from an organization that many may see as more neutral on the topic , @entity65 said			1
the thinking on circumcision has swung wildly over the years			0
it 's been practiced by @entity85 and @entity86 for thousands of years , but did n't become common in this country until the 20th century			0
by one estimate , only 25per cent of @entity1 male newborns were circumcised in 1900			0
it gradually became the cultural norm , and in the 1950s and 1960s surpassed 80per cent			0
but then the trend reversed			0
part of it had to do with changing demographics , as the @entity1 population grew to include larger numbers of @entity100 and other ethnic groups that did n't traditionally circumcise their children			0
controversial : the new guidelines , which state how the procedure can cut risk for @entity23 , stds and penile cancer , are expected to draw intense opposition from anti-circumcision advocacy groups also , opposition to the procedure grew from advocates who decried the pain , bleeding and risk of infections to newborns			1
their message was aided by the @entity119 and by the neutral stance of physicians groups - including , for a time , the @entity68			0
a wave of state medicaid programs stopped paying for newborn circumcisions , which cost roughly $ 150 to $ 200			2
the list eventually rose to 18 states , according to @entity10 numbers			0
by 2010 the newborn circumcision rate was down to about 58per cent , according to one @entity10 estimate			2
but even as the circumcision rate dropped , more medical evidence came in supporting it - particularly three rigorous and influential studies in @entity47 that looked at the spread of @entity23 and other sexually transmitted diseases in circumcised and uncircumcised men and their partners			1
in the new guidelines , the @entity10 says there is now strong evidence that male circumcision can : studies have not shown that circumcision will reduce an @entity23 - infected man 's chances of spreading the @entity50 virus to women			1
and research has not found circumcision to be a help in stopping spread of @entity23 during gay sex			2
the guidelines say circumcision is safer for newborns and infants than for older males , noting the complication rate rises from 0.5per cent in newborns to nine per cent in children ages one to nine , according to the @entity10			1
minor bleeding and pain are the most common problems , experts say			0
@entity10 officials are recommending doctors tell parents of baby boys of the benefits and risks of circumcision			1
@entity17 did not say how that information should be presented			0
because circumcision can be beneficial to men as well , the @entity10 says information about the procedure also should be given to sexually active uncircumcised men - especially men considered to be at higher risk of catching @entity23 , the guidelines say .			1
