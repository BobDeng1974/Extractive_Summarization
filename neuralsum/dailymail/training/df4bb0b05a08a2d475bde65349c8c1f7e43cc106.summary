by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:11 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 15:13 est , 6 september 2012 if this nine - year - old boy 's reaction is anything to go by , the @entity3 's plan to allow homeowners to build small extensions or conservatories without needing planning permission is an absolute stinker			1
@entity13 @entity12 appeared to stare with disbelief as @entity15 announced the policy - and his partner in crime @entity18 did n't look that interested either			1
today the prime minister and his deputy were at a new housing development in @entity23 , @entity24 , to announce they would sweep away planning rules and bureaucracy so homes , shops , offices and industrial units will be allowed to expand with no need to ask their local authority			1
perhaps realising he needed more convincing , the prime minister and @entity18 then popped for a cup of tea with @entity12 and his mother to explain their planning reforms further			1
however , it will also mean residents no longer have a right to challenge thousands of construction schemes on neighbouring properties , even if they believe it will have an adverse impact on them			1
in other plans , the government is to offer up to £ 10billion in state - backed guarantees to encourage housing developments , a move which ministers believe could mean 100,000 homes being built over three years			1
rules on how many affordable homes must be included in a development may also be relaxed			2
cuppa : @entity15 and @entity18 then had some tea with @entity12 and his mum @entity70 in their new home and explained their planning reforms there will be help for 16,500 first - time buyers , who will be offered equity loans of up to 20 per cent of the property value that can be used as a deposit			1
new ‘ permitted development rights ’ will be introduced to allow a change of use from commercial to residential purposes – although local authorities will be able to seek exemptions where they believe there will be a negative economic impact the move will mean residents no longer have a right to challenge thousands of construction schemes it means disused offices or light industrial premises will be able to switch to residential developments with no need for planning permission			1
currently , homeowners need planning permission to make any change that extends more than a few feet from their property ’s rear wall , requiring them to fill in complicated application forms that typically take eight weeks or more to be considered			0
ministers say this adds unnecessary cost and delays to people ’s improvement plans			0
under the new system , the size of extensions allowed without permission , therefore , will be doubled to about 20 feet for terraced properties and 26 feet for detatched			2
the change will not apply in protected areas , including conservation areas , @entity123 , the @entity124 and areas of outstanding natural beauty , where development rights are already more limited			0
under changes , businesses will be able to expand premises by 100 square metres and industrial units by 200 square metres , and shops and offices will be permitted to develop up to the boundary of the premises			0
every year there are more than 400,000 planning applications processed , with almost 200,000 for residential improvements , many of which are for changes such as conservatories or extensions			2
ministers say the changes will provide a crucial and immediate stimulus to the construction sector			2
there will be a month - long consultation on the measures before they are implemented later in the year			0
‘ this government means business in delivering plans to help people build new homes and kick - start the economy , ' the prime minister and deputy prime minister will say			0
‘ we ’re determined to cut through the bureaucracy that holds us back			0
yep , this one should protect me from booing crowds : chancellor of the exchequer @entity162 points at at a @entity164 vehicle during a visit to defence contractor @entity168 ' facility in @entity169 today you could record your @entity172 speech with one of those : the chancellor was accompanied on his tour by chief executive of @entity168 @entity178 ( right ) ‘ that starts with getting the planners off our backs , getting behind the businesses that have the ambition to expand , and meeting the aspirations of families that want to buy or improve a home			0
’ a government source added : ‘ we want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements : not just to cut red tape and strengthen individual homeowners ’ rights , but also to help generate economic activity which will support small traders in particular			0

the @entity199 and @entity200 were in @entity23 , @entity24 , to launch the policy but young @entity12 appeared less than impressed
the move is designed to encourage conservatories , loft extensions or garage conversions
will also mean residents no longer have a right to challenge thousands of construction schemes
