by @entity0 published : 12:43 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:55 est , 17 february 2014 as this old photograph from @entity6 shows , it used to be water under the bridge			1
but that was in the 1960s , when the river was regularly dredged			2
now , as the residents of @entity16 are all too aware , the width of this stretch of the @entity14 has practically halved			1
the way we were : in the 1960s , a wide expanse flowed along the @entity14 in @entity16 , @entity6 ticking clock : but as this recent photo shows , years of poor dredging caused earth to build up on the banks doom : so when the rains kept coming , the water had no way out other than to burst the banks as a result it regularly bursts its banks , flowing over and around the bridge instead			1
in startling contrast to today 's scenario , the picture , taken five decades ago , shows a wide expanse of water passing through @entity16 with plenty of room for water levels to rise			1
a matching image taken shortly before the recent floods reveals how silt and debris have gradually built up and extended towards the centre of the river			1
the overflow holes in the sides of the bridge which were once above the water line now sit redundantly in the side of the banks , surrounded by grass and mud			2
critics blame the @entity57 - which took over responsibility for river maintenance around 20 years ago - for failing to dredge regularly			1
@entity60 , 38 , a founding member of the @entity61 on the @entity62 ( @entity63 ) , from the drenched village of @entity65 , said : ' the photo speaks for itself really			0
end of the line : some of the overspill from the @entity14 on the @entity69 , causing mayhem ' it shows the massive build - up that you get when you do n't dredge			2
' looking at that photo is looking right at the problem			0
' it shows perfectly the scale of neglect by the @entity57 , and shows what we have been saying all along			0
' the mother - of - two added : ' we have got to have dredging and it has got to be done properly			0
' parts of @entity16 and its surrounding villages have been under water since the start of the year			2
the rivers were once managed by the @entity92 who regularly cleared silt and debris from the waterways , until responsibility passed to the @entity57			0
torrent : pumps are in full flow at @entity101 , @entity6 , removing water from the @entity104 drain and back into the @entity14 , but there are still millions of litres to clear as the risk of disease grows hard at work : @entity110 engineers install the remaining pumps at @entity101 , near @entity112 in @entity6 the flag group has obtained rainfall records for the area around the @entity14 and @entity116 for the last 20 years			1
they reveal between december 1993 and february 1994 around 20 inches of rain fell - five inches less than during the same time this year			0
a spokesman for the group said : ' so roughly the same rainfall but far more flooding now			0
' what has changed ? dredging seems to be the biggest obvious difference between then and now			0

wide expanse flowed through @entity16 on @entity14 in @entity6
but without regular dredging , earth built up along banks and *clogged* them
the *government* agency took over river maintenance 20 years ago
