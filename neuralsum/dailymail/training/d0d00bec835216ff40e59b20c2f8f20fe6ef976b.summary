ministers will also use existing powers to enforce secondary legislation needed to stop ‘ abuse ’ of the tax and benefits system			1
however , government sources say the details are yet to be fleshed out , and the flagship @entity35 is unlikely to be published in full until the autumn			0
the moves will be seen as a reaction to the electoral threat posed by the @entity6 @entity40 , which rocked the political establishment this week by taking votes and council seats from all the main parties			0
@entity40 leader @entity45 focussed on the impact of immigration , and how membership of the @entity49 stopped @entity6 acting to limit it , during much of the local election campaign			0
deputy prime minister @entity2 today signalled that the days of @entity6 ’s benefits ‘ free - for - all ’ for foreigners were over			1
he said : ‘ we have been very clear that we totally get that there ’s a heightened level of public anxiety about immigration			0
‘ we should stamp out abuse and make sure our public services and benefits are not simply a free - for - all , there needs to be some relation between what you put in and what you get out , ’ he told @entity59			1
ministers will use the @entity69 , passed in the last year , to close a loophole that allowed migrants who no longer have a right to work here to carry on claiming benefits			0
the test that decides who can access benefits will also be tightened			2
migrants from the @entity79 will be told that they can only receive @entity80 if they are genuinely looking for a job			0
it will include a tougher test to ensure they can speak @entity85 properly			0
the @entity86 will be given more powers to recoup costs for treating people from overseas while access to benefits from @entity92 will be curbed if migrants can not speak @entity85 migrants will be given only six months to find a job before benefits stop , unless they can prove they are close to getting a job			1
@entity99 responded to fears about the appeal of @entity6 's benefits system in drawing immigrants to @entity6			1
he put immigration minister @entity104 in charge of a @entity107 committee examining the ' pull factors ' which needed to be addressed			0
it also included ministers for health , housing , legal aid and welfare			1
ministers are in talks with other @entity49 countries about whether jobless migrants can be the responsibility of their home country before they start claiming benefits in the @entity6			0
@entity6 would also like to curb the £ 36million paid every year in child benefit to 24,000 families who do live in the @entity6			0
the government also wants to end the idea that the @entity86 is a ‘ free international health service ’			1
efforts will be stepped up to recoup costs from migrants who use the @entity86 , through charging or requiring private medical insurance			2
@entity99 used a major speech on immigration in march to insist housing , benefits and healthcare should not be available free of charge to anyone arriving in @entity6 one in ten new rentals of social homes goes to a foreign national			1

illegal immigrants will also face tougher checks to stop them getting driving licences , credit cards , personal loans or a council house			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ this government will take further measures to ensure that , yes , of course we should be a welcoming , generous country to those people who want to come here and make a contribution			1
‘ but people who want to come here – worst of all illegally – or want to come here and sort of abuse our generosity and use our benefits and public services when they ’re not really properly entitled to do so , yes , we need to clamp down on that , ’ he told @entity165 ’s @entity164			1
‘ so , yes , to a sort of open and tolerant @entity6 , but no to abuse of the immigration system and that ’s what we will make sure happens			2
’ the immigration bill expected in tomorrow 's @entity21 will implement the major legal changes which can not be made using secondary legislation			2
mr @entity99 has promised to ‘ fight back very robustly ’ against any attempts by the courts or the @entity49 to block @entity6 curbs on benefits for migrants			0
in a speech in march , mr the next stage of reform is to say , ‘ let ’s not just reform the immigration system			2
let ’s make sure the housing system , the welfare system , the legal aid system , all of these things actually fit in – the health system – fit in with our immigration policy , ’ sending a very clear message that people can come and work , but they ca n’t come for the wrong reasons .			1
