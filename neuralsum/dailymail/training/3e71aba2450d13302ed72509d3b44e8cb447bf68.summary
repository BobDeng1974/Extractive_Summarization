@entity1 backbenchers have accused ‘ teenage spin doctors ’ in @entity6 of pressurising ministers to retract ‘ truthful ’ comments on immigration			1
it comes after defence secretary @entity8 was apparently slapped down for remarks he made on immigration during a tv interview			1
he said some communities felt ‘ swamped ’ and ‘ under siege ’ by @entity15 migrants			0
but hours after making the comments on sunday he retracted them – seemingly following an intervention from @entity19			1
defence secretary @entity8 ( left ) and skills minister @entity20 ( right ) both retracted outspoken comments they made about immigration - something which has been criticised by @entity1 backbenchers and on tuesday , skills minister @entity20 suggested that @entity25 would never have full control over its borders so long as we are a member of the @entity30			1
he also told @entity31 that @entity25 need to get used to the fact that there will be a ‘ very large amount of immigration every year ’			0
later he also sent out a retraction , saying he did not believe the @entity25 can not seek to change the way immigration works within the @entity39			2
@entity6 sources insisted that the ministers had decided themselves to issue their own clarifications , but some conservative backbenchers remained unconvinced			1
@entity44 , mp for @entity45 , tweeted : ‘ @entity46 absolutely right to use the word “ swamped ” about “ some ” immigration hotspots despite what teenage spin doctors at @entity19 might say			1
’ yesterday , mr @entity44 said : ‘ i think it was unfair on @entity8 because there are significant parts of the country where people are feeling what he said			1
‘ it was poor form to cut the legs from under him in hours over one word			0
he spoke the truth and it was unnecessary for them to exacerbate the situation by undermining him			0
’ he added : ‘ the public do n’t want to be told what the problem is – they want to be told the solution			0
‘ the reason the public is impatient on immigration is that they keep being told the problems but not the solutions			0
i think the solution is leaving the @entity30 if we ca n’t get control of our borders back			0
’ @entity82 , mp for @entity83 , said : ‘ what @entity20 said was n’t anything controversial – he was merely stating a fact			1
the prime minister knows that well – that ’s why the immigration figures are so high			2
why he has been slapped down for telling the truth is beyond me			2
‘ if number 10 think these retractions will prove anything to the public , then they ’re living in cloud cuckoo land			2
’ he added : ‘ this has now happened to two ministers			0
after the debacle of making @entity8 issue a retraction after making sensible comments , you ’d have thought they would have learned their lesson – but what happened to @entity20 shows they have n’t			1
’ several hours after mr @entity8 told @entity107 that he believed some communities were ‘ swamped ’ by @entity15 migrants , a government ‘ source ’ sent round a quote saying : ‘ he accepts he should have chosen his words better			1
he should have said under pressure			0
’ and mr @entity20 ’ retraction read : ‘ i do not believe and did not say that we can not seek changes to the way immigration works within the @entity30			2
quite the contrary , i think it is essential that we do so			0
