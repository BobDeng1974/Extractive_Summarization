by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 05:39 est , 8 march 2013 all good sportsmen know to keep their eye on the ball - and spectators would often do well to follow the same advice			0
one fan watching @entity9 's cricket team struggle against their @entity11 hosts learned that the hard way when he was hit on the head by the ball as it was smashed for a six			1
he had been chatting to his friend when @entity18 opener @entity16 managed the only six of the game , and did n't notice as the ball flew towards him			1
scroll down to watch the video unsuspecting : the fan is seen chatting to friends just before the ball hits him ' look out , son ! ' : the fan is in pain , but he is not seriously injured by the ball howzat ? the fan looks bemused after being caught off guard on the grass verge the commentator says ' oh no , it 's a @entity35 ! ' when he sees the spectator get injured - @entity38 slang for when someone is hit on the head by a ball			1
the term 's name derives from rugby league player @entity44			2
he was struck on the head when the ball was passed to him while @entity46 had briefly stopped paying attention during a rugby match			2
@entity38 tv programme @entity49 , which @entity46 had a weekly slot on , began awarding the @entity52 for similar mishaps			0
the term quickly became popular and was shortened to ' @entity35 '			0
it is now often applied to any incident when an object hits someone on the head			0
the commentator audibly winces as he sees the accident , saying : ' look out , son ! ' then , using an @entity38 slang term for an incident where someone is struck on the head with a ball , he adds : ' oh , it 's a @entity35 ! oh , it 's a painful one too			2
' he was looking the other way and he 's copped it ! ' it was a dream test debut for @entity16 - but a nightmare for the spectator			1
@entity74 hit : @entity16 launches his shot towards the boundary at @entity77 incoming : the ball ( circled ) is watched by the whole crowd - except for one - as it heads for a six ' ow ... zat hurt ! the fan clasps his head after being hit having skittled @entity9 out for a pitiful 167 , @entity11 finished the second day of the @entity82 131 - 0			1
hopefully the injured fan was a @entity18 fan - otherwise his day would have been made even worse			0
there was one good bit of news for him though - he was not seriously injured ... and he 'll be able to watch his famous accident for years			0
