and to mark @entity0 winning the accolade , we take a look at his life and times as a player and coach			0
@entity2 boss @entity0 has scooped the @entity21 award 1			0
@entity0 the player is probably best remembered for that moment at @entity24 in 1992 when his drilled free - kick through the @entity27 wall ended @entity29 's long wait for the @entity30			1
with @entity29 wearing an all - orange strip , it was fitting that a @entity6 should step up to settle a goalless contest that was drifting towards penalties			1
@entity0 's strike earned him a special place in @entity29 's history as they won a @entity30 final at the third time of asking and a footnote in history as the last goalscorer in the competition before it became the @entity30			1

this was the most significant of his 88 goals for @entity29 , an incredible scoring record for a defender			1
his ability to hit powerful right - footed free - kicks proved a real weapon and many will remember the one in a 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity64 at the @entity65 in 1994			1
signed from @entity66 in 1988 , he joined compatriot @entity68 's ' @entity67 ' , playing alongside superstars like @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1

loved by the @entity29 fans , he was given the nicknames ' @entity89 ' , because of his resemblance to @entity93 's fictional character , and dressed up as the adventurer ( complete with dog ' @entity95 ' ) for a photoshoot during his time at the club			2
his pale complexion also led to @entity0 being called @entity101 after the albino gorilla in @entity103 that lived from 1964 to 2003			0
@entity0 earned the nickname @entity89 because of his likeness to the popular cartoon character 4			0
@entity0 started out at @entity6 club @entity107 as a teenager and quickly established that reputation of a goalscoring centre half			2
in his first season there , he found the net on 15 occasions in the league and it was n't long before @entity117 signed him			0

@entity117 boss @entity122 had reservations about his ability and the constant scrutiny almost prompted him to quit the game altogether			0

led by @entity134 , who encouraged @entity0 's attacking gifts , they won three @entity6 titles in a row between 1987 and 1989 and the @entity30 in 1988			1
that season proved a real highlight for @entity0 , who scored a remarkable 26 goals			2
@entity142 fans will also remember @entity0 for a certain incident in a @entity146 94 @entity145 qualifier			0
in the 57th minute of a make - or - break qualifier between @entity149 and @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity147 was dragged down by @entity0 on the edge of the area			1
@entity0 probably should have gone but @entity155 referee @entity154 issued only a free - kick and a yellow card			1
the defender compounded the sense of injustice four minutes later , chipping in a free - kick to send @entity150 spiralling out			1
the @entity163 documentary crew filming do i not like that recorded @entity167 's reaction as he told the linesman : ' the referee 's got me the sack , thank him ever so much for that wo n't you			2
' @entity0 later admitted : ' i expected the red card			0
