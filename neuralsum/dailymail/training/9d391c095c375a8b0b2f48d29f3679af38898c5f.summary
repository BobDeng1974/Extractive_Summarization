@entity1 regulators have ordered @entity2 to clarify its new privacy policy and make it easier for users to opt out of it			1
@entity8 ’s @entity7 led a @entity1 investigation into @entity2 ’s new unified policy , which replaced 60 individual policies for its search , email and other services and regulates how it uses the personal data it collects			1
today it said the @entity18 company had ' months ' to make changes			2
@entity2 responded that it is reviewing the commission ’s report but that it believes its policy respects @entity1 law			0
' we have received the report and are reviewing it now , ' said @entity39 , its global privacy counsel			0
' our new privacy policy demonstrates our long - standing commitment to protecting our users ' information and creating great products			0
' we are confident that our privacy notices respect @entity1 law			0
' the commission said today that it has three main concerns about the policy : it ’s not clear enough in explaining to users what data is collected and how it will be used ; it ’s too difficult for users to opt out of data collection ; and @entity2 does n’t say how long it will hold onto data			1
the concerns were made in a letter to the @entity18 internet company , which was seen by @entity59			0
the letter , which stopped short of declaring @entity2 's approach to collecting user data illegal , follows an investigation led by @entity8 's @entity64 ( @entity27 ) that began in february			1
leading the inquiry on behalf of @entity1 , @entity8 's data protection watchdog had already questioned the legality and fairness of @entity2 's new privacy policy , introduced in march			1
the current row revolves around @entity2 's decision to pool of anonymous user data across @entity2 services			2
for @entity2 , this is a big advantage when selling online ads. @entity2 and other large internet groups like @entity77 provide free services to consumers and earn money from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than traditional tv or radio campaigns			0
this consolidated 60 privacy policies into one and pooled data collected on individual users across its services , including @entity91 , @entity92 and its social network @entity94			1
users can not opt out			2
the regulators ' letter said : ' combining personal data on such a large scale creates high risks to the privacy of users			1
' ' therefore , @entity2 should modify its practices when combining data across services for these purposes , ' the letter said			2
it was signed by 24 of @entity109 's 27 data regulators plus those of @entity111 and @entity112			1
in the past , the company has said the changes would allow it to tailor search results more accurately and improve services for consumers			2
@entity2 has also said previously it is confident that its privacy policy does not run foul of @entity1 law			0
in the letter , the regulators listed 12 ' practical recommendations ' for @entity2 to bring its privacy policy into line			0
the first five cover how @entity2 tells people about how their personal information and browsing records will be used , highlighting location data and credit card data in particular			1
the regulators also want @entity2 to spell out its intentions and methods for combining data collected from its various services			1
they want the web search giant to ask users for explicit consent when bundling data together , the letter said			1
the pooling of anonymous user data across @entity2 services , is a big advantage when selling online ads. the news comes as @entity150 regulators in the @entity18 are believed to be moving closer to suing @entity2 over allegations that the company has abused its dominance of internet search to stifle competition and drive up online advertising prices			1
several news outlets reported that staff members at the @entity24 are preparing to recommend that the agency file an antitrust lawsuit against the search giant			1
a majority of the five @entity24 commissioners would have to approve a suit before legal action could proceed			1
the reports from the @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity59 cited unnamed people briefed on the @entity24 's investigation			1
@entity24 spokesman @entity171 declined to comment			2
the agency has been investigating @entity2 's business practices			0
the probe was triggered by complaints that @entity2 has been highlighting its peripheral services in its influential search results and relegating offerings from its rivals to the back pages			0
the @entity24 also has been looking into whether @entity2 has rigged its results in a way that has prodded websites to pay more to promote their services through @entity2 's advertising network			2
in a statement friday , @entity2 said , ' we are happy to answer any questions that regulators have about our business			0
' @entity2 and other large internet groups like @entity77 provide free services to consumers and earn money from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than traditional tv or radio campaigns			0
@entity200 , a lawyer at @entity201 , said : ' @entity2 is being very aggressive and are playing for high stakes because these ( privacy policy ) changes are very valuable to their advertising business			0
' they may be prepared to test the legal position in @entity1 to see what they can get away with			0
' the tussle with the @entity109 over data privacy comes at a delicate time for @entity2			0
@entity1 's antitrust authorities are also examining the company 's business model to see if it uses its clout in search advertising to favour its own services over competitors ' offerings			2
the firm has been in negotiations with the @entity223 for several months solutions to its alleged anti-competitive behaviour by promoting its own products ahead of rivals ' in search results			0
the search giant has faced repeated questions over its privacy and competition policies			1
