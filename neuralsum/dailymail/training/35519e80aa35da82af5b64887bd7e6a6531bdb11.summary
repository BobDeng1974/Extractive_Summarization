for the second year running a charity dedicated to supporting returned servicemen and women has enlisted the help of dozens of celebrities for a unique campaign			1
but for @entity8 country singer @entity7 , the take a seat for @entity11 initiative holds a very special significance			1
while performing for the troops in @entity14 with her two sisters @entity17 and @entity18 as their band @entity16 , @entity7 had the experience of a lifetime , as well as a little extra something else she had n't quite bargained for			1
' being the captain of the plane he actually invited the singers up to the front , he was pulling all the moves out , ' the singer told @entity42			0
over the 20 - day tour of @entity14 , where the trio played a concert every day or two , @entity7 got to know many of the troops well , but she had a special connection with wing commander @entity24			1
@entity24 is executive officer of number 84 wing , a pilot who flies the @entity48			2
' we actually did n't meet up until about eight months later , and then once we did it was kind of like - that was it ! ' @entity7 said			2
' i was down in @entity53 and he took me on a date and we were pretty much inseparable after that			0
this year @entity7 is involved in the @entity11 campaign , and has decorated her own chair which will be auctioned off this week the three sisters spent 20 days performing in @entity14 at the end of 2006 ' it 's kinda crazy that we met all these people and soon they 'd be in our circle of friends and then coming to our wedding ! ' the country singer revealed			1
speaking of her own experience in the war - torn region in 2006 , @entity7 said as she was only 21 at the time so the seriousness of the situation did n't really sink in until she was back home			0
' you 're wearing camo and bullet proof vests and helmets ... but you block it out so you can have a good time , and you want them to have a good time while you 're there as well , ' she said speaking of the troops			0
@entity7 also revealed how her time travelling @entity14 helped her put things in perspective			1
' they 're going through this every day , we only had to do it for 20 , ' she said			0
' it 's a pretty full - on experience , and bombs do go off there ... but you put them out of your mind			0
' the @entity16 have also returned overseas for more performances in @entity97 since then @entity24 ( right ) and @entity7 will get married in @entity98 later this year the @entity100 winner also said that what she saw improved her relationship with @entity24 infinitely			1
' i think it helped our relationship down the track as he 's had to go back on deployment			0
but he 's currently at home ahead of their wedding in @entity98 later this year			1
' it actually put my mind at ease ... i think if you do n't have any picture in your mind at all you always think the absolute worst , ' @entity7 said			0
plus their busy careers which often take both of them around the world mean they 're used to being apart			0
' you would n't think that a pilot and country singer would be compatible , ' @entity7 laughed			1
@entity127 campaign , devised by homewares company @entity128 , enlists the help of 40 personalities from around @entity8 and asks them to decorate a chair , which is then auctioned off with all proceeds going back into the charity			1
legacy is particularly close to @entity7 's heart , and she said she wanted to do ' anything i can to help bring awareness ' , but joked that the process of designing the piece of furniture helped her realise that she should ' stick to singing and playing guitar '			2
this is the chair @entity7 created , which will be auctioned off along with 39 others over the next week chairs designed by a range of @entity8 such as @entity150 star @entity149 , journalist @entity151 and food stylist @entity152 are being auctioned off online until thursday october 30th ' i think the last time i used glue was in primary school , ' the singer laughed			1
the chair , which is ' all covered in music paper , like a decollage ' has a lot of @entity16 in it , with three red ribbons wound across the back to represent the trio of band members			2
' for a touch of glamour we put a pair of red high heels on the seat ' , @entity7 revealed			2
since 2006 , the singer has taken more trips to perform for the troops with her sisters , and said some of the men and women they met overseas still travel to their shows			0
' you kind of have that connection forever really , cause you have experienced what these men and women experience every day , ' @entity7 said			0
