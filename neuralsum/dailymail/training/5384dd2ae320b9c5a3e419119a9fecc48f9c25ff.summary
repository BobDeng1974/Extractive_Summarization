by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 has been banned from paying bankers bonuses worth twice their salaries by the government			1
the @entity6 said the huge payouts could not be made while the troubled lender was still part - owned by the taxpayer			2
but staff at @entity2 will still receive bonuses worth an entire year ’s pay , and 77 people will be paid more than £ 1million			1
@entity2 has been blocked from doubling bonuses by the @entity16 government under new @entity19 rules , banks can pay staff bonuses worth 100 per cent of salary			1
but to increase it to 200 per cent they must get the agreement of shareholders			0
in the case of part - nationalised @entity2 , the taxpayer is the largest shareholder , and the @entity29 , which manages the @entity6 stake , has blocked the increase			2
the troubled bank reignited the row over pay in february when it revealed plans for huge bonuses , including £ 237million for its investment bankers , despite slumping into the red with an £ 8.2billion loss			1
at the time deputy prime minister @entity42 warned : ' a loss - making bank that is basically on the kind of life support system because of the generosity of @entity16 taxpayers should n’t be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses and , you know , it needs to continue to come down			1
’ @entity53 '' s @entity6 said it could not back bigger bonuses at @entity2 while it is still ' in recovery ' now @entity2 has warned that not being able to pay bigger bonuses will put it at a competitive disadvantage because staff could be lured to rival firms with the promise of bigger pay deals			1
it said : the board believes the best commercial solution for @entity2 is to have the flexibility on variable to fixed pay ratios that is now emerging as the sector norm			0
‘ this would also allow @entity2 to maintain the maximum amount of compensation that could be subject to performance conditions including clawback for conduct issues that may emerge in future			0
this position was understood during consultation with institutional shareholders			0
’ however a @entity6 spokesman insisted there could be no rise in the bonus cap at @entity2 because the bank has not yet completed its restructuring and remains majority public - owned			1
the @entity6 will not oppose a 2:1 bonus ratio at @entity85 , in which it still has a 25 per cent stake , because the bank has largely completed its restructuring			2
it added that @entity2 's pay policies mean that the firm will remain a back - marker in its overall remuneration compared with other banks			2
the spokesman added : ‘ we have made clear there will be no rise in the bonus cap for an @entity2 still in recovery , but a bonus cap at @entity85 that reflects the progress it has made in getting money back for taxpayers			0
‘ a few years ago , bonuses were out of control , banks needed bailing out and the economy was shrinking			0
‘ under this government 's long - term economic plan bonuses are down , the banks are recovering and the economy is growing			0
’ the losses of the taxpayer - backed lender , which is just over 80 per cent owned by the government , have widened significantly from £ 5.3billion in 2012			0
it includes £ 3.8billion set aside for a string of scandal - related charges and a £ 4.8billion hit for the creation of an internal ‘ bad bank ’			2
the @entity122 bonus rules , which came into force on january 1 , limit annual payouts for 2014 onwards to 100 % of annual salary , or a maximum of 200 % with shareholder approval			1
despite using the rules to block bigger bonuses at @entity2 , the @entity16 government officially opposes the policy			0
it claims the plan will not support stronger and safer banks and has launched a challenge to the rules in the @entity137			0
@entity138 yesterday won the support of shareholders for payments of up to 200 per cent of salary , while also introducing new role - based pay awards that mean staff can still pick up bumper handouts .			1

@entity6 *refuses* to *sanction* pay - outs worth 200 % of annual salary
warns bank is still ' in recovery ' and not yet performing well enough
but under @entity122 rules bank can still pay bonuses worth 100 % of pay
77 staff will earn £ 1million for last year , down from *95* a year ago
