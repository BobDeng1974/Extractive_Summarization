search teams , which included distraught locals , covered thousands of acres of rugged land , forests and deep river water in a desperate attempt to find april since she went missing on october 1 from outside her home in @entity10 , mid @entity11			1
but after searches of all key areas were completed , april 's parents were given the heartbreaking news that they may never get to say goodbye to their daughter			1
the effort to return april to her family , code named @entity188 , lasted almost eight months and involved 17 police teams scouring 32sq km of @entity11 countryside			1
the terrain of winding rivers , mountainous valleys and deep mine shafts and caves , made it a ' unique challenge ' , the officer who led @entity195 said			2
around 16,000 officer search days were dedicated to finding april , involving police from 47 forces across the @entity5 , and volunteers from around the world			1
he said it was the largest deployment of @entity5 officers since the @entity212 disaster			0
@entity213 : a team walk the banks of a river during the eight month search , the biggest in @entity5 history inspector @entity219 , the search coordinator for @entity220 , said : ' the driving force for us has always been to find april and reunite her with her family			2
' that was the priority right from the start and that 's what was motivating all those officers who came to help from all over the country and further afield			2
' he said due to the fact that @entity30 painted himself as an ' @entity233 or @entity234 wannabe ' that meant he could have had intimate knowledge of area , making every cave , stream , mineshaft , ditch and quarry a search area			0
mr @entity219 said it was with ' immense disappointment ' that the search was concluded last month			0
' during the course of the search i honestly believed that we would find april , it 's an immense disappointment that we have been unable to return april to her family , ' he added			2
' we ca n't think of any worst case scenario			0
' the search began on the night of october 1 last year with a handful of concerned neighbours on the @entity258 - y - @entity257 estate , soon joined by hundreds of members of the public who came from far and wide as word spread on social and news media			0
no avail : this group of volunteer kayakers and mountain rescue experts joined the search upstream from @entity10 town water : a hovercraft search and rescue team on the @entity38 estuary as they were not sure if april may have been swept out to sea after being dumped in a river the realisation , following @entity14 's arrest , that april would not be found alive was shattering news for all involved			1
detective superintendent @entity278 , the senior investigating officer , said : ' there was a feeling of extreme disappointment because everybody approached the investigation from the outset in the hope that we were going to find april safe and well			2
' describing the reaction of april 's parents , @entity287 and @entity288 , he added : ' obviously , on receiving that terrible , terrible news they were extremely traumatised			1
' they needed a huge amount of support			0
' the vast majority of people could never begin to imagine what they have had to go through and continue to go through because , as we all know they still have n't had their daughter or their daughter 's remains returned to them			0
' emotion en masse : hundreds take to the streets of @entity10 on their way to a church service for missing five - year - old @entity14 in the days after she disappeared mr @entity278 said police have not given up hope that one day april 's remains will be recovered			1
' my message to @entity14 is quite clear , he needs to tell @entity287 and @entity316 , and the family of april what he has done with their daughter , ' he said			1
mr @entity219 added : ' as soon as we have any more intelligence or information we will recommence the search			0
' like any other little girl april @entity2 loved to play out with her friends			0
and on the night she was snatched by child killer @entity14 , april had thrown a ' tantrum ' so she could do just that			1
her father , @entity2 , had told her she could not go out to play			0
but april @entity2 cried and kept asking to be allowed outside â€“ so eventually @entity287 and his wife @entity288 gave in			0
brave : @entity287 and @entity316 , the parents of @entity14 arrive at @entity49 , where they have been every day during their daughter 's killer 's murder trial less than 20 minutes later she was gone , never to be seen again			1
@entity316 said she and her husband had both told april it was too late to go outside on her little pink bike.in her statement to police , mrs @entity316 said : ' she kept on and on and had a little bit of a tantrum			1
' ' we eventually gave in			0
i zipped up her coat and she went off to play outside with her friend			0
i told her i did n't want her to be long			0
i think that was around 7pm			0
this was the last time i saw her			0
' mrs @entity316 said that at about 7.20pm it was getting dark and colder , and she wanted april to come back inside			0
tragic : @entity353 @entity352 with april @entity2 ' bike ( right ) and a bike that was being ridden by her best friend ( left ) on the night she went missing he father said she was pleading to be allowed out to play with her best friend after watching the film but they told her it was too late			2
' she had a little paddy , ' he said			0
' i suppose we just gave in and she was told she could only go out for a short while , ' he added			0
the couple said april knew about ' stranger danger ' and would never have got into a car with someone she did not know			0
mr @entity2 said he had known @entity30 since about 1992 when the defendant was dating the sister of his then girlfriend			0
he said : ' i ca n't think of any reason why @entity14 would take april , he is a father too			1
i do n't understand why he would do this to her			0
' despite the family 's anguish , @entity30 has continued to refuse to ease their suffering by telling them what he did with their daughter 's body .			1
