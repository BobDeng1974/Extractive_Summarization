@entity0 has insisted the main priority for @entity2 this season must be to qualify for the @entity4 despite monday night 's @entity6 quarter - final against @entity7 offering their best chance of a trophy this season			1
@entity11 is under strict orders from his bosses to restore @entity2 to @entity16 football 's elite after last season 's seventh - place finish under @entity19 saw them miss out			1
@entity2 have n't won the @entity6 since 2004 and landed any silverware since sir @entity21 left but the @entity22 says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the primary objective of the campaign			1
@entity0 feels it is more important that @entity28 get back into @entity29 than win the @entity6 @entity11 agrees with @entity7 manager @entity30 that a top four finish is akin to winning a trophy @entity33 scored a late winner as @entity2 beat @entity35 in the @entity36 on wednesday ' i always want to get the goals what we have set			1
and the goals we have set is the top four , ' said @entity0			2
' a title is fantastic			0
when you win the @entity6 you are not in the @entity4 which is important for the club , but you have won a title			2
so for the players it is fantastic , for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the @entity4			0
' @entity7 manager @entity30 has said that finishing in the top four was effectively winning a trophy and @entity11 agrees			1
' yes , i think that he is right			0
i think that @entity30 is saying always the right things			0
i think that for a club the @entity4 is the highest level and that 's why he is saying that			0
' to finish in the first four is a fantastic result , i think			0
and for us , @entity2 , more i think			0
' @entity11 is still expected to put a strong team out against @entity7			1
@entity62 in particular wants to add the only major club medal missing from his cv			0
the @entity2 boss , who has had to endure heavy criticism for the team 's style of play despite a run of only two defeats in 22 matches , believes the result of the cup tie could also have a pyschological effect on the run - in for the all - important top four			1
' every match you play has an influence in the next match			0
so we are in a ' rat race ' in the @entity36 and the club who wins the @entity6 match has a very good feeling for the next matches , ' he said			2
' it could be damaging for the team that loses , but you can also react			0
' @entity11 has been tetchy mood in the build - up to monday night 's game , feeling he has been misrepresented over claims that he has the best team in the @entity36 , lacks a 20 - goal - a - season striker and has a bad relationship with assistant @entity101 , who sat stony - faced when @entity2 scored their last - minute winner at @entity35 on wednesday night			1
@entity11 ( right ) adamantly rejected talk of a rift with his assistant @entity101 after the @entity35 game @entity107 has been substituted early in @entity2 's last two games due to poor performances midfielder @entity110 ( left ) could be set to start his first game for @entity2 since january 23 among the problems @entity0 has to face is the poor form of Â£ 60million record signing @entity107 who has been substituted early in @entity2 's last two games and the lack of goals from @entity118 whose loan spell is unlikely to be renewed at the end of the season without a dramatic change in fortunes			1
the crowd reaction to the @entity2 manager on monday will be interesting to see			2
so far , he has received little warmth from the fans whose cries of ' attack , attack , attack ' are a sign of frustration against @entity0 's possession - based game			1
one piece of good news is that @entity110 may be able to start his first game since january 23 following a muscle rapture			0
@entity2 's best results this season have come when @entity110 has played .			2

@entity0 's main priority is to get @entity2 back into @entity29
@entity2 occupy fourth in the @entity36 table despite shaky *displays*
