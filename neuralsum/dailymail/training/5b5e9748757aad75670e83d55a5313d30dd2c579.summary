by @entity0 published : 14:18 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 02:27 est , 18 december 2012 a middle - aged woman claimed cash benefits for two male relatives , both of whom were dead , a jury heard today			1
@entity7 did not reveal either man ’s death when claiming the money and managed to accrue almost £ 20,000 pounds illegally , according to the prosecution			1
today the 62 - year - old woman faced charges of fraud and failure to disclose information in relation to the two dead men - one of whom was her father and the other her cousin			1
@entity21 where @entity7 's trial is being heard by mr @entity23 @entity7 continued to receive her cousin ’s housing benefit and her father ’s pension even after the former moved out and then after both men had died , the jury heard			1
she also did not tell her local council of her cousin @entity33 ’ departure or his death , it was claimed			2
nor did she inform the @entity36 that her father , @entity37 , had died			2
instead she contacted them to insist he had not died and that his pension should continue			0
@entity41 , prosecuting at @entity21 , told the seven men and five women on the jury : ' what we say in this case is that the defendant , mrs @entity7 , has both given false information and also failed to give information and in both respects we say she did that in order to receive or to continue to receive the benefit that should not have been coming to her			1
' we also say that in doing that , she was dishonest			0
' he added : ' an important point is that both of the people who were entitled to the benefit are now dead			2
' he said on the forms filled in by mr @entity33 and mrs @entity7 when he first moved into the home she shared with husband @entity64 , in 2005 , both falsely stated that they were not related to each other			2
after being assessed she began to receive payments from @entity69 direct to her bank account for £ 75 pounds per week , to cover his rent			1
when he then moved out of her home , in @entity75 , @entity76 , she did not tell the council and continued to receive the money			2
even after he died , on march 25 , 2009 , she still did not let on			0
mr @entity41 said : ' the second person is the defendant ’s father , @entity37 , and it was to him the pension was due			1
' both sets were paid directly to the defendant			0
in the case of mr @entity33 it was because she was acting as his landlady			0
in the case of mr @entity37 it was because she was acting as an appointee , handling his affairs			0
' the @entity36 was initially informed about the death of mr @entity37 but then there was a phone call from someone calling themselves @entity7 , the daughter of mr @entity37 , in effect retracting the statement , that the circumstances had changed , and that the pension should continue			1
' mr @entity37 had passed away on february 2 , 2009			0
@entity104 , the then manager of the @entity105 in @entity106 , said mr @entity33 had been a client there and had given his previous address as @entity109			0
they got him to apply for housing benefit to cover his time with them and it was a routine audit some time later by @entity115 and @entity116 that exposed the duplicate applications			1
it was during the same audit that investigators realised mr @entity33 had actually died			0
mrs @entity104 , appearing in the witness box at @entity21 , admitted under cross-examination by defence counsel @entity123 that she did not know of @entity7 ’s existence at the time			1
she also acknowledged she could not see how @entity7 would have known that mr @entity33 was living at the hostel			2
@entity7 denies fraud by dishonestly furnishing a document , by failing to give prompt notification of a change of circumstances , and three further counts by failing to disclose information			1
when interviewed by investigators from @entity69 , @entity7 told them she had had “ a bit of a nervous breakdown ” because of her father dying			2
as a result she had left her job with @entity139 , @entity76			0
she also told them that her cousin , @entity33 , had come to live with her because he had been deported from @entity142			0
describing him as “ an alcoholic ” and “ a nomad ” , she said she would never know where he was and that sometimes he would come back and leave the house in a mess			0
“ he was family ” , she explained as her reason for putting him up			0
when the council uncovered the over-payments she told them she had tried to contact them on a number of occasions to let them know about mr @entity33 ’ death but that she had never received a reply			0
so she put all of the housing benefit income into an old account held in her son ’s name , she said , and did not touch it			1
@entity164 , principal investigator in the case , said the total overpaid in housing benefit was £ 13,800 pounds			1
she told the court that when the situation with @entity37 was revealed , @entity7 flatly denied continuing to receive his pension payments			1
she also said it had not been her who called the @entity36 to request that the payments continue , even after her father ’s death had been registered			1
the trial , before mr @entity23 , continues			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
