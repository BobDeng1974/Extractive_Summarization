by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the @entity2 begins in @entity3 on saturday with @entity5 hopes firmly resting on the shoulders of @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity7 is aiming to defend the overall winner 's yellow jersey - or maillot jaune - having triumphed in the 100th edition of the race last year , while @entity8 is targeting regaining the green points jersey , awarded to the best sprinter , which he won in 2011			1
here @entity16 takes a look at the main competitors for the yellow , green , polka dot ( @entity22 ) and white ( best young rider ) jerseys			1
ready : sky employees from @entity26 unveil the world 's biggest jersey ahead of the @entity29 geared up : @entity3 will host the @entity30 , with @entity7 looking to retain his yellow jersey yellow jersey ( general classification winner ) contenders @entity7 ( @entity35 , 10 - 11 favourite ) speculation surrounded whether or not 2012 winner @entity38 would feature in @entity35 's squad for the @entity2 in the build - up to the race but he has been left out and ' @entity42 ' has the nine men he wants to mount his bid for glory			1
@entity7 is odds - on to deliver his second - and @entity35 's third - yellow jersey on the spin , with his all - round ability placing him ahead of the pack			1
the 29 - year - old 's versatility on the climbs and in the time - trial stages should give him the edge but , although he won the @entity55 for the second consecutive year , he has suffered from injuries and illness recently that could wreck his chances			1
favourite : @entity35 's @entity5 rider @entity7 has a great chance of retaining his yellow jersey versatile : @entity7 ( in yellow ) is strong at climbing as well as time trials , which should give him the edge mentor : @entity7 ( right ) with @entity35 team principal @entity66 during the @entity2 absent : 2012 @entity2 winner @entity38 ( centre ) was not selected by @entity35 @entity71 ( @entity70 , 6 - 4 ) two - time @entity2 winner @entity71 finished fourth in last year 's edition following a return from a two - year drugs ban but he has won both the @entity75 and the @entity76 already this season			1
the @entity78 will surely be @entity7 's main challenger and will push him hard in the mountains			1
threat : @entity81 's @entity71 is @entity7 's most likely challenger in this year 's @entity2 @entity82 ( @entity83 , 10 - 1 ) the 29 - year - old @entity84 is an accomplished climber and , with @entity87 victories in the @entity88 ( 2013 ) and @entity89 ( 2010 ) already under his belt , @entity82 is experienced			1
a win here would give @entity82 a full set of @entity87 wins and he will have to perform exceptionally well in the mountains to deliver that			0
experienced : @entity84 @entity82 is looking to complete his set of @entity87 wins @entity99 ( @entity100 , 14 - 1 ) the @entity102 champion has returned to form in recent months and the unusually versatile @entity78 - he is a strong sprinter as well as a strong climber - could spring a surprise			0
form : @entity100 's @entity81 rider @entity99 has been getting back to his best recently @entity106 ( @entity107 , 33 - 1 ) @entity108 won the young rider classification white jersey in 2013 and has followed that up with a @entity112 victory this year			2
it is probably too soon for the 25 - year - old but he is a dark horse for this year 's race			2
outsider : @entity118 rider @entity106 of @entity119 is a dark horse for the general classification green jersey ( points classification winner ) contenders @entity125 ( @entity126 , 8 - 15 favourite ) the @entity128 has competed in two tours and won the green jersey on each occasion so it is hard to look past the 24 - year - old			1
he is not just a pure sprinter but is very strong on long stages and can climb a bit too , meaning he is always there or thereabouts when it comes to collecting points on a stage			2
always in green : @entity128 @entity125 is looking to win his third straight points classification @entity147 ( @entity146 , 9 - 2 ) @entity148 won the most stages last season and the @entity151 looks to be the new sprint sensation			2
he is an out - and - out sprinter though so will have to rely on stage wins if he is to take home green			2
raw pace : @entity151 sprint sensation @entity147 won the most stages during last year 's tour @entity8 ( @entity158 , 5 - 1 ) the same applies for @entity8 who will need to gather as many stages as possible - starting with the @entity30 on saturday in @entity3 which could see him wear yellow for the first time ever too - if he is to regain the jersey he won in 2011			1
@entity8 out - sprinted @entity147 in the @entity163 earlier this year but they have barely competed aside from that so it will be interesting to see if there are any psychological scars left over from last year			2
the 29 - year - old @entity169 rider has a team built to deliver him stage wins so @entity8 could upset the odds and walk away with green			1
regain : manxman @entity8 is hoping to win the green jersey he first claimed in 2011 rivalry : @entity8 ( left ) and @entity148 ( right ) will be competing for sprint stage wins this year @entity178 king : after struggling a little last year , @entity8 is hoping to return to the top of the charts @entity182 ( @entity181 , 14 - 1 ) the @entity151 leads the stage victory rankings for 2014 with 11 already this year but is often overshadowed by @entity8 and @entity148			1
he will struggle to hold off his most consistent competitors			0
quick : @entity151 @entity182 has already won 11 stages so far this year and could claim the sprinter 's jersey @entity189 ( @entity190 , 16 - 1 ) not a sprinter but more a stage rider			1
he had a brilliant spring , dominating the classics , but tends to come into his own after long , arduous stages with sprints at the end			0
difficult to see the @entity197 gaining enough points			0
unusual : @entity197 @entity189 is more of a stage rider than a sprinter in reality polka dot jersey ( @entity22 ) contenders @entity71 ( @entity70 , 7 - 2 favourite ) @entity7 ( @entity35 , 4 - 1 ) rivalry : @entity7 ( right ) or @entity71 ( left ) will likely claim the @entity206 of the @entity208 jersey as well @entity210 ( @entity209 , 9 - 2 ) @entity210 seems the most likely to claim the polka dot jersey outside of the big two			1
the @entity213 won the white jersey in 2011 and he claimed the 19th stage of that race at the summit of @entity218 , highlighting his climbing credentials			2
@entity220 ( @entity190 , 6 - 1 ) his climbing prowess has brought him ten @entity87 stage victories , as well as the mountains classification in the @entity224			0
at 35 he may be starting to show signs of aging but he is still capable of claiming the stage wins necessary to bolster his chances			0
@entity229 ( @entity209 , 12 - 1 ) @entity230 have two riders more than capable of claiming the @entity22 jersey			0
@entity233 won this jersey in 2012 and always performs well at his home race so he could deliver once more			0
pride : @entity213 @entity229 is hoping to claim polka dot jersey glory for his home nation white jersey ( best young rider winner ) contenders @entity242 ( @entity243 ) a disastrous end to last year 's tour seems to have fuelled the @entity213 and if he shows his true form he should claim the white jersey			1
prone to an implosion though , so by no means guaranteed			0
@entity250 ( @entity251 ) stage wins may be more likely for this strong climber but , as another @entity213 hope , the home crowd will be cheering him towards a high general classification finish			0
second fiddle : pole @entity258 will ride for @entity70 's leader @entity71 at the tour @entity258 ( @entity70 ) the @entity259 led his team at the @entity88 this year and finished in white there and could do so again			2
however , he may have to sacrifice his own position for team leader @entity71 and that may cost him			0
@entity267 ( @entity158 ) another pole with big ambitions but his form has let him down			0
@entity267 seriously struggled in the @entity272 and will need to find some extra pace from somewhere if he is to challenge			0
@entity274 ( @entity100 ) an extreme outside shot to win , but @entity274 will hope to follow @entity99 and possibly shoot up the rankings alongside his fellow spaniard by doing his donkey work in the mountains			0
unlikely : @entity78 @entity274 is an extreme outside shot to win but could claim the white jersey			0
