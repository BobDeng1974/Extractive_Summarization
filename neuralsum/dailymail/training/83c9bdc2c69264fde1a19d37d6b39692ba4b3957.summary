video : scroll down to see @entity1 's post-match conference retort : @entity1 told @entity28 1 that @entity2 's ' specialist in failure ' comments were ' embarrassing for @entity23 ' advancing : @entity1 saw his team beat @entity14 2 - 1 at the @entity33 ‘ am i afraid of failure ? he is a specialist in failure			1
so if one supposes he ’s right and i ’m afraid of failure , it ’s because i do n’t fail many times			2
' so maybe he ’s right			2
i ’m not used to failing			2
but the reality is he ’s a specialist because , eight years without a piece of silverware , that ’s failure			1
‘ if i did that in @entity23 i ’d leave and not come back to @entity45			1
i do n’t fear anything in football			0
’ @entity1 said : ‘ i am embarrassed for him honestly			2
i am more disappointed for @entity23 than for me			2
’ @entity1 had claimed on friday morning that ‘ fear of failure ’ was the reason @entity51 managers were ruling their teams out of the title race			1
that prompted @entity2 ’s extraordinary response on friday and he stirred things up again on saturday when he claimed @entity1 ’s comments were unprovoked			1
‘ i do n’t accept that one is always @entity61 and the other one is always the bad guy , ’ he said			0
the @entity7 manager also confirmed that disciplinary action would be taken against @entity65 after he apologised for taking a female companion back to the team hotel			1
limp : @entity23 were dumped out of the @entity12 by @entity68 after failing to register a shot on target married @entity65 had consistently denied taking a girl to the @entity72 in @entity73 the night before the 2 - 0 victory over @entity75 on february 2			1
@entity1 added : ‘ it is an internal matter but i do not want to comment publicly because i respect his privacy			1
’ @entity65 came on as a second half substitute for @entity7 yesterday and will face @entity81 ’s side on the weekend of march 8			1
denied : @entity82 failed to give @entity14 a second penalty after @entity84 was clearly fouled reflecting on sunday 's win over @entity14 , which tees up a home last - eight meeting with @entity88 , @entity1 added : ' i 'm very proud of the way we responded to the huge defeat we had last week , and that was the most pleasing thing			1
' to win makes you stronger , and that was important today			0
' the @entity12 is always interesting , and now we have another big tie here			2
it will be an interesting game			0
' @entity14 boss @entity99 felt his side were wrongly denied a certain penalty kick which could well have changed the outcome of the game			1
definite : @entity17 was second to the ball and brought down the @entity105 striker the visitors were awarded one penalty when @entity18 tripped @entity84 and @entity108 converted , but it was another incident in the area that became the focus of much of the post-match analysis			0
referee @entity82 ruled @entity17 committed no foul when he went in hard on @entity84 , although replays suggested otherwise			0
@entity84 's amateur dramatics did him no favours , but @entity99 nevertheless felt there was only one decision			2
' it was a blatant penalty			0
i do n’t know why @entity82 did n’t give it but maybe it came too close to the first penalty			0
it should have been an easy decision , ' @entity99 said			0
' the second one is clear			0
i 'm not sure if it was just after [ the first one being awarded ] , but it was a clear penalty			0
@entity84 got a touch on the ball and young @entity17 has taken him out			0
bitterly disappointed : @entity14 boss @entity99 was angry that the penalty was not awarded ' it was a strange decision			1
it was a penalty ... and it was a clear one			0
' reflecting on the game overall , @entity99 added : ' i thought the best team lost			0
the very least we deserved was a replay			0
' we 're disappointed with the goals , apart from that we were a threat , we played with real confidence and belief			0
