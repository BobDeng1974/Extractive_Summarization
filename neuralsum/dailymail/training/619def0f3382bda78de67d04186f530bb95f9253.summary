@entity0 and @entity1 launched a double assault on the @entity3 yesterday , saying their addiction to borrowing and refusal to cut welfare would cripple the economy			1
in separate speeches , the chancellor and the prime minister warned that the party would always put off difficult decisions on @entity16 's debts – with mr @entity0 accusing them of taking a ' manana ' approach			1
mr @entity1 painted a bleak picture of @entity16 under @entity3 , saying its plans would cause ' utter chaos … the chaos of higher taxes , fleeing businesses , jobs lost , an economy stagnating ... the chaos of public services that ca n't meet demand and are creaking under pressure '			1
speaking in @entity32 , his chancellor said @entity3 's plans would allow it to go on piling up debts to dangerous levels			1
mr @entity1 painted a bleak picture of @entity16 under @entity3 , saying its plans would cause ' utter chaos ' but their attack on @entity3 's economic credibility suffered a setback last night when @entity43 's party said it would sign up to the @entity45 's new charter of @entity46 , which will require the next government to start bringing day - to - day spending under control			1
the chancellor added that a @entity52 government would also start paying down @entity16 's towering debts by 2019 – a pledge that @entity3 and the @entity55 have refused to match the chancellor added that a @entity52 government would also start paying down @entity16 's towering debts by 2019 – a pledge that @entity3 and the @entity55 have refused to match			1
he added : ' if after seven years of growth we do n't start reducing our debt , round the world people will ask , ' if not now , then when ? ' @entity64 is not a credible fiscal plan			0
' the @entity67 phrase ' manana ' refers to putting off a difficult task until tomorrow			0
mr @entity1 sought to drive the message home with a warning that @entity3 's plans represented a ' massive gamble ' with the economy			1
he said the @entity75 would take a further £ 12billion out of welfare spending , while @entity3 would not cut benefits by a single penny			2
in a speech in @entity80 , he went on : ' every pound you do n't save on welfare is a pound you might have to take out of the services we need , like the @entity86 and schools			0
if we do n't make these savings now , it would be a lot worse later			0
' he told reporters there were still ' signs of excess ' in the welfare budget despite a string of cuts , all of which have been opposed by @entity3			2
but mr @entity0 was left licking his wounds last night when the intended trap for @entity3 backfired			1
the chancellor hoped the party would refuse to back the new @entity106 – thereby creating a clear dividing line on the economy ahead of the election			1
but , in a surprise move , the shadow chancellor @entity110 said @entity3 would support the plans to balance the government 's day - to - day spending by 2018 – even though he previously rejected setting a target date			1
the @entity75 said the move effectively committed @entity3 to matching its goal of finding £ 30billion of savings			2
but @entity3 claimed the new law – which mps will vote on before the election – was broadly in line with its own plans			2
mr @entity110 said : ' this charter is consistent with our position			0
' in fact , conservative aims go much further than the charter requires			0
the @entity75 have pledged to balance the whole budget by 2019 , including the £ 28billion spent on capital projects , such as new roads			0
they also plan to run a budget surplus of £ 23billion by 2020			0
however @entity3 has described the cuts required to achieve this as ' extreme and ideological '			2
and a @entity136 poll for the @entity137 last night suggested the public was sceptical about the idea			0
the survey found that 30 per cent of people want to balance the budget even if it means deep cuts to services , while 66 per cent oppose the idea .			0
