' i was made to feel like i was being an over-protective and silly mum			2
' i would urge any parent in the same situation when they know in their heart that something is wrong with their child to trust their instincts and go to @entity52			1
' mrs @entity16 , who lives in @entity53 , @entity54 , with @entity9 , her husband @entity30 , and their other children @entity56 , 24 , @entity59 , 23 , and @entity60 , 21 , said : ' we first noticed that @entity9 was n’t eating properly even though he had never been a fussy eater			1

he was being sick as soon as he woke up and then he was being sick at school as well and they would ring me to tell me			0
' i saw four different doctors at the same surgery but i felt they had all spoken to each other beforehand as before i had even spoken , they seemed to have made their mind up that there was nothing wrong with @entity9			1

mrs @entity16 , said : ' it was another week before @entity9 had the @entity116 scan and by this time , he was pretty lifeless			1

' we were in tears			0
we were terrified but also felt relief that someone was finally listening to us			0
