by @entity0 a council has been accused of painting @entity3 ’s most pointless double yellow lines which measure just 18in - too small to fit a single tyre			1
residents were stunned when the lines appeared in @entity7 , south west @entity8 , curved around a corner kerb at a three - way junction - but barely big enough for a toy car or a unicycle			1
the lines were today criticised by the @entity14 , which said it appeared to be ‘ another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test ’			1
no parking here : local resident @entity21 with the double yellow lines behind the @entity23 and @entity24 on @entity25 in @entity7 , south - west @entity8 corner : the @entity14 said it appeared to be ' another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test ' motorcyclist @entity30 , who spotted the lines , said : ‘ i think it 's stupid and a bit pointless			1
the way they 've made the access road look pedestrian is very dangerous for pedestrians and motorcyclists			0
‘ the pavement feels slippery underfoot and it is n't immediately obvious that it is still a road			0
’ another @entity7 resident said : ‘ those lines are just stupid			1
not even a unicycle could park there			0
what a waste of time			2
my daughter ’s little toy car could n’t even fit on that tiny bit of kerb			0
’ the double yellow lines cover a curved area of kerb which is 18in long			1
the outer yellow line curve is around 30in			0
the lines were spotted behind @entity23 and the @entity24 pub on @entity25			0
the yellow lines would fit a standard - size shoebox or carving knife , which are both around 15in long			1
it could also fit a normal roller blade , which measures slightly less , but would be much too short for a skateboard , which measures around 31in on average			0
dangerous ? the lines are behind @entity23 and the @entity24 in @entity7 town centre wider view : this photograph of the whole junction helps to put the double yellow lines in context comparisons : the lines could fit a normal roller blade ( left ) but would be much too short for a skateboard ( right ) @entity76 from the @entity14 said : ‘ the nice flagstones make it clear you are entering a pedestrian area			1
' but since you can paint double yellow lines on tarmac , someone has decided they must - no matter how small a section is			1
' another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test ' @entity14 ' the road signs do n't seem to be pointing in the right direction to inform any lost drivers , so the area does not provide a lot more clarity over what is legal and what is n't			1
' a @entity100 spokesman told @entity101 : ' the short lines simply mark the end of the " no parking " zone indicated by the lines on either side of the road			0
' until recently they extended along the street which has been newly paved by developers as shared space ( pedestrians and vehicles )			0
' without the markings at the corner drivers might assume that they could park there , blocking access to the car park and the shared space			0
' the shortest double lines in the @entity3 were painted last august between a taxi rank and parking bays in @entity8 , measuring just over 9in ( right )			2
@entity125 said it was a mistake made by a contractor , and would be corrected			0
earlier last year , double yellow lines stretching for just 13in were discovered on a street in @entity130			2
@entity131 described the lines as ' common practice '			0
a spokesman said : ' the yellow lines are at either end of a disabled parking bay and are there to prevent vehicles parked either side from encroaching on the disabled bay '			2
council bosses also laid down 18in double yellow lines on parking bays in @entity145 , north @entity8 , in 2007			1
in 2012 , double yellow lines measuring just 21in also appeared in @entity147 , @entity148 ( right ) .			2

curved around corner kerb at three - way junction in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity14 : a ' strict application of regulations failing the common sense test '
local residents label the lines ' stupid ' , ' pointless ' and ' a waste of time '
yellow lines are so small that they could only just fit half a skateboard
