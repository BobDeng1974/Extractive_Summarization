a video showing what is thought to be first ever 3d - printed bullet being fired has appeared on @entity3			1
in the video , from user @entity7 , three bullets of different weights and shapes are fired at various targets using a @entity12 shotgun			1
according to the video , each plastic pellet has been 3d - printed			1
a small lead shot was then added to give the bullet weight			1
in the @entity3 video , uploaded by @entity19 , three different 3d - printed bullets are fired at various targets			1
the first bullet , pictured , weighed four tenths of an ounce			2
a small lead shot was added to each bullet to give it weight as it travels through the air each of the three 3d - printed bullets were loaded into shotgun casing and fired using a @entity12 gun			1
in this screenshot , the shooter - @entity3 user @entity34 - is shown loading the bullets into the gun earlier this week a working plastic gun , printed using a self - assembled 3d printer , a nail and some household screws , successfully fired nine shots			1
the gun , based on blueprints made available online by @entity46 last month , cost just $ 25 ( £ 16 ) to make and fired the .38 caliber shots by the @entity49 engineer who built it			0
up until now , the blueprints for the ' liberator ' gun have been mainly printed using industrial - grade 3d printers that cost around £ 5,250 ( $ 8,000 )			1
this latest gun is one of the first to be @entity57 printed using the much cheaper @entity59 - 101 3d printer - a printer that can be bought online , assembled at home and costs £ 1,136 ( $ 1,725 )			1
because the gun is made entirely from plastic it makes it possible to carry the gun through airport security metal detectors , for example , without being found out			0
earlier this month , the @entity70 tested this theory by smuggling a version of the @entity53 gun onto a @entity74 train			0
in the video , @entity19 is heard saying : ' you 've heard of a 3d - printed gun ? how about 3d - printed bullets			1
' he goes on to explain that @entity3 user @entity80 printed a ' couple of shotgun pellets ' with the first weighing about four tenths of an ounce			2
@entity19 adds that a small piece of lead shot is added to the casing to give the bullet enough weight to travel and pierce the target			2
each pellet took an hour to print and is fitted into a traditional shotgun case			0
in the video , @entity3 user @entity34 is shown firing the first bullet using a @entity12 shotgun aimed at a dartboard , perched above a wooden table in a field			1
the bullet goes through the dartboard , and through the plastic cans its resting on			0
in a second experiment the pair are shown firing another bullet , this time weighing five tenths of an ounce , at a block of wood with a target on it			2
the second bullet fired in the @entity3 video weighed five tenths of an ounce			2
it also had a small lead shot added and was fitted to a shotgun casing			0
this bullet was nicknamed the @entity119 the @entity121 - printed bullet was fired at a target attached to a plank of wood			1
the wood was rested up against a wooden table			0
the bullet appeared to bounce off the plank , yet when the @entity19 inspected the wood he discovered it not only pierced the plank , ( pictured ) it also pierced the wooden table behind it this second bullet , nicknamed in the video as the @entity119 , had a honeycomb - design with strips of plastic			2
in the video , the bullet hits the target but does n't appear to pierce it , instead it looks as if the bullet bounces off			0
@entity19 goes on to explain the reason the @entity119 did n't pierce the wood is because of the ' stability problem that 's common with a bullet not shot through a rifle barrel			0
' adding ' it goes on the path of least resistance , and this path is usually sideways ' and this is known however , when @entity19 examines the piece of wood he finds that the bullet not only pierced the plank of wood , but it also pierced the wooden table holding the plank of wood upright			0
he 's heard saying : ' that 's amazing			0
i did n't expect that			0
' even though it hit sideways , it still went through			0
' a third bullet with three points on the end , nicknamed the ' tri-factor round ' , is then shown being fired at a polystyrene mannequin head on the wooden table			2
the bullet hits the top of the head , knocking it off the table , but then ricochets off behind			0
the third 3d - printed bullet , nicknamed the tri-factor because it has three points on the end , was fired in the @entity3 video at a polystyrene mannequin head the @entity180 bullet performed the weakest of the three 3d - printed bullets			1
it hit the polystyrene mannequin target before bouncing off sideways			0
this may have been because the head was knocked off the table , due to its light weight , before the bullet could penetrate earlier this week a working plastic gun , printed using a self - assembled 3d printer , a nail and some household screws , successfully fired nine shots			1
the gun , based on blueprints made available online by @entity46 last month , cost just $ 25 ( £ 16 ) to make and fired the .38 caliber shots by the @entity49 engineer who built it			0
up until now , the blueprints for the ' liberator ' gun have been mainly printed using industrial - grade 3d printers that cost around £ 5,250 ( $ 8,000 )			2

earlier this month , the @entity70 tested this theory by smuggling a version of the @entity53 gun onto a @entity74 train			0
as a result , 3d - printed plastic bullets could also be smuggled			1
video : you 've seen the 3d - printed gun			1
now meet the 3d - printed bullets			1

three 3d - printed guns are shown being fired from a @entity12 shotgun
each bullet is a different weight and shape and is fired at targets of various *thickness*
