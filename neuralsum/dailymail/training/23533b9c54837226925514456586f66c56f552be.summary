archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a @entity3 carriage and two horses that appear to have been buried upright professor @entity18 of the @entity19 at the @entity20 , who led the dig , said : ' the find is unique , it is not resembling any other carriage dating from the @entity3 era ever uncovered in @entity10			1
' according to @entity28 , the discovery of the carriage was unexpected as treasure hunters have plundered many of the ancient mounds found in the region in a bid to find gold , despite a @entity36 ban of this activity			1
the particular mound where the carriage was discovered , is adjacent to the well known mound of @entity10 @entity41 , where the same research team uncovered a hoard of gold last year			0
the chariot and horse skeletons are 2,500 - years - old and were discovered in the village of @entity9 in north - east @entity10 a @entity49 chariot complete with a seat and boot was unearthed along with two buried horses in the village of @entity54 in @entity10 in 2010 , which shows similarities to the new find , despite being younger in age			1
