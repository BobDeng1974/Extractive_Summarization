‘ i owe @entity19 a lot , ’ she said after the 400m hurdles final			1
taking a gold medal back to @entity22 , to go alongside the silver she won at the @entity25 , is a fine demonstration of gratitude to the elder sister who first coached her over the obstacles as a 10 - year - old			1
child described her vitory as a ‘ complete relief			2
’ it was the first major championships final where she was expected to win , as the fastest qualifier and by being the best in @entity39 this year			2
celebration : @entity2 celebrates winning the women 's 400m hurdles at the @entity43 ‘ i was feeling the pressure , ’ she said , ‘ anything other than winning it and i ’d have been disappointed			1
i was quite nervous but i managed to calm myself and did what i had to do			0
’ the 27 - year - old started strongly , clearing the second hurdle easily and putting her foot down to move away from the field with four hurdles left			1
she began to tire coming off the final hurdle but dipped to cross the line in 54.48sec , holding off the fast finishing @entity57 , @entity56			0
‘ i just tried to get to that line as quickly as possible , ’ said @entity2 , ‘ my legs were dying all of a sudden and i was about five metres out and everybody came alongside me			2
i did n’t really know what had happened when i crossed the line			0
obviously the @entity63 meant a lot because it was at home but to actually have my own title now and be @entity68 champion is the best feeling ever			0
’ finish : child crosses the line ahead of the @entity72 's @entity71 winner : @entity74 said her sister had first taught her to hurdle child , who was a part - time pe teacher at @entity78 until 2011 , praised her coach , @entity79 , for helping get her mentally ready after the hype of being the @entity82 2014 poster girl			1
now she hopes to be given a place in today ’s 4x400m final after the team of @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 advanced third quickest			0

@entity96 , 24 , led until the final 60m when the @entity101 , who beat her own personal best by more than a second , charged past			0
number one : child reacts after winning the 400m hurdles in @entity14 afterwards , she collapsed into the arms of her mother , @entity110			1

’ @entity96 has adopted a new confident , front - running style			0
she said : ‘ i knew i had a fast race in me but that ’s the most uncomfortable way to race , running scared the whole way and i knew in that field someone was coming — it was slightly suicidal			0
’ there was no fairytale double for @entity124 , the 40 - year - old mother of two who won the 10,000m title this week			1
