rather than burning her bra , an entrepreneur fed up with ' sexualised ' underwear in stores was inspired to design her own range that suited her feminist ideals			0
@entity6 used her life 's savings to found @entity11 lingerie brand @entity9 to provide stylish underwear for women of all shapes and sizes			1
the first collection , called @entity17 offers simple , sporty - looking sets which are free from cleavage - boosting padding or wiring			1
designer @entity6 raised money on a fundraising website to start her own feminist lingerie line ( modelled here by two real women ) in her images , @entity6 was determined to use real women , posing naturally and not catering to the male gaze the lingerie - which comes in chartreuse , orange and black - is made from sustainable bamboo fabric rather than lace and satin because it moulds to the wearer ’s body , and has antibacterial properties			1
on her fundraising kickstarter page @entity6 wrote : ‘ not everything is about being sexy or being objectified for the male gaze			2
' explaining why she felt driven to design the line , she said : ‘ i found it difficult to find a lingerie brand that shared the same ethos as myself : empowerment , body confidence and the non-objectification of women			1
’ ‘ so instead of succumbing to the body - shaming , sexualised and objectifying lingerie on the market , i used my frustration to start my own brand , @entity9 , with the support of @entity55			1
’ after being accepted on to the charity 's year - long enterprise program , @entity6 received mentorship and professional advice for free to develop her product			2
in the brand 's promotional imagery , the two models certainly seem empowered lounging around the house in @entity9 underwear			2
the underwear sets are n't underwired or padded and are made with anti-bacterial , soft bamboo fibre the women look smiling and healthy and sport natural bodies , rather than catwalk models ' ultra-slimline shape			0
@entity6 named each of the underwear styles with ' francophile sounding words , calling them : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 !			0
she said : ' they are really vibrant and fun words to pronounce , which works well with the vibrant colours of the bras and knickers			0
' the entrepreneur launched a @entity87 campaign for @entity9 , which ends on 10 april , and has already exceeded the original £ 5,000 target , with 165 backers			0
@entity6 explains the brand 's story in the accompanying video with lingering detail shots panning over her creations , a behind - the - scenes look at the promotional shoot , and girls pledging their support to her campaign			0
she said : ‘ i am absolutely elated with the result			0
i genuinely could n’t fathom reaching the £ 5,000 goal with 18 days left ! ’ @entity6 wanted to design lingerie that was n't about objectifying women ‘ i have been so blessed by the support received from women , men , transgender and non-binary people ’s generosity ! ’ ‘ the amount of press created , and also @entity112 sharing an article on @entity9 on her facebook ( to close to six million followers ) added to such a viral buzz about @entity9 ’s @entity87			1
‘ all extra money funded beyond £ 5,000 will go into producing more lingerie for the “ @entity17 ” collection in order to sell directly online			1
' she added that there 's a deeper significance to raising money so quickly for her concept			0
‘ [ it ] just goes to show that people do not agree with the sexualisation and objectification of girls within the lingerie industry			0
' @entity9 is ' revolutionising ' the underwear world by being ' a body - positive , feminist lingerie brand , ’ she added			1
@entity9 underwear is available in size small ( @entity11 eight to ten ) , medium ( @entity11 ten to 12 ) and large ( 12 to 14 ) through the @entity87 campaign images for @entity9 included real women who even showed off their armpit hair in pictures			2
