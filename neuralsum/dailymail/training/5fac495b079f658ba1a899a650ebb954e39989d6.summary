by @entity0 a company is selling t - shirts with the slogan ' @entity4 ' emblazoned across the chest on @entity6			1
the online clothing store , @entity7 , sells the short - sleeved t - shirts for between £ 15 and £ 17 on the warehouse website			1
but potential customers are clearly not willing to buy the deeply offensive t - shirts , slamming both @entity6 and the clothes shop , which has its headquarters in the @entity14			1
speaks for itself : @entity6 users are furious that the product is being sold and called the tops ' disgusting ' @entity6 were attacked for allowing the t shirts to be sold , with many saying the message is offensive users branded the shop and its message ' disgusting ' and ' disturbing '			1
but on @entity7 's @entity26 page , someone wrote under the company name that they had ' no idea ' that the message was printed and said it had been computer generated			1
on the same @entity26 page , it shows people who appear to be employees , apparently hand - printing other t - shirts - although it is unclear whether this is the process for every shirt			1
they posted a variety of responses to @entity26 users , saying they had deleted the product and saying that the message had been generated from the dictionary			2
@entity46 wrote : ' i 'm disgusted by this product , and can think of no good reason for such a slogan			0
that someone thought it was a good idea disturbs me somewhat			0
' @entity54 wrote : ' you guys are kidding with this shirt 's slogan , right ? in what universe is that shirt remotely acceptable in civilized society ? gross			0
' the solid gold bomb facebook page claimed a computer programme had generated the offensive slogan the website said they were deleting the tshirts and said they appreciated everyone 's ' understanding ' of the mistake @entity72 demanded answers from both the creators and @entity6 : ' in what society is this even acceptable ? and why is @entity6 listing these ? there is no possible justification including a misplaced sense of irony for wearing a tshirt with this message on it			1
' @entity83 wrote : ' i am sick and tired of the perpetuation of rape culture			0
can you not think for one second about how assault victims feel when seeing something like this ' rape them ' t - shirt ? can you not see how this contributes to the view that it 's okay to rape other people ! ? this is not the kind of product i expect to see on @entity6			2
' @entity99 said : ' that 's advocation of abuse and criminal behaviour			0
do you really want to get shut down that badly ? ! i am ashamed of you , @entity6 ! how dare you exploit a felonious , heinous act			2
take that damnable thing down before someone brings the law against you ! if i do not see it removed , i shall boycott and spread the word			0
' others were outraged that @entity6 would allow such a product to be sold , and told them to ' pay their taxes ' - a reference to the probe into the sprawling business ' tax payments , which came under scrutiny last year			2
someone claiming to represent the firm initially wrote on the @entity26 page : ' these ' keep @entity123 ' shirts were computer generated and we did n't even know we had a shirt that says that ... as soon as we realised this , we immediately deleted them			1
' it takes time for them to be deleted			0
' i was the person responsible for running the script that generated the t - shirt , not the company , not any other individuals			2
' i appreciate everyone 's comments but please , accept this as a mistake as we certainly do not condone " rape " ... ' @entity142 users vented their fury that the t - shirts ' promote rape ' and also poke fun at the serious sexual assault			1
angry users urged others to email the clothes shop and @entity6 to express their disgust and demands that it be removed from sale			1
@entity6 reveiwers flooded the ' feedback ' panel with comments expressing their thoughts on the ' awful ' product @entity6 customers quickly rounded on the company and the seller , saying that the people who wore the branded shirts are ' scum ' the brightly - coloured tops ' message are a twist on the ' @entity170 ' morale - boosting slogan used in @entity171 by the @entity172			1
the message has experienced a boom in popularity in recent years , and sparked a trend in shops producing products such as tea - towels , posters and cushions , bearing the slogan , or a play on it			2
@entity7 , who produce the t - shirts , was created and launched from @entity186 , @entity187 , and describes itself as a ' small global t - shirt company '			1
they write on their website about their range : ' we managed to list our @entity170 parody series on the site			0
' @entity195 , beat on and @entity197 are @entity196 ! rock on ! ' @entity6 's sale policies say that in terms of offensive material : ' @entity6 reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of listings posted to our site			0
