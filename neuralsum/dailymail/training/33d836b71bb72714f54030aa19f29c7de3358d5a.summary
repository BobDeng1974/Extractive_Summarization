a @entity1 woman has attempted to sue her former lawyers for professional negligence claiming they failed to properly explain to her that getting a divorce would end her marriage			2
@entity7 claimed that , alongside a number of other allegations , her solicitors failed to advise her that finalising divorce proceedings would officially end her marriage			0
the @entity12 argued that the lawyers should have clearly explained that a divorce would terminate her marriage			2
the woman claims lawyers failed to advise that finalising divorce proceedings would officially end her marriage she claimed lawyers failed to take into account her faith and should have recommended judicial separation - a step away from full divorce - as an alternative course of action , the @entity17 reported			1
her claims , which were made against two separate firms of solicitors , had already been rejected by the court , but ms @entity7 sunbequently appealed against the dismissal of certain aspects of the case			2
thrown out : judge @entity33 dismissed the case the presiding judge , @entity33 said : ' the most striking of mrs @entity7 's many allegations of negligence against her solicitors was that , having regard to her @entity12 faith , mrs @entity38 had failed to give her the advice which was requisite in view of her firmly held belief in the sanctity of marriage ... ' ... either in terms of the alternative of judicial separation , or about the impossibility of pursuing divorce proceedings to a clean break settlement , without thereby inevitably bringing about the final termination of her marriage , which she wished to avoid			1
' her case was rejected by the court			0
the curious case follows another bizarre divorce proceeding - a woman who is splitting from her husband over peas			1
