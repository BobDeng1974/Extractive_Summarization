when @entity2 @entity4 speaker @entity3 , a @entity5 , jolted @entity6 this week by inviting @entity8 prime minister @entity7 to address @entity9 , his office said it had been done ' on behalf of the bipartisan leadership			1
' in reality , it was among the most partisan moves so far by @entity2 's newly @entity5 - controlled @entity9			2
officials told @entity8 newspaper @entity15 the @entity8 leader had ' spat ' in president @entity19 's face			1
' we thought we 've seen everything , ' the newspaper quoted an unnamed senior @entity2 official as saying			0
' but @entity7 managed to surprise even us			0
furious : the @entity24 is said to be outraged over prime minister @entity7 ’s plan to speak before @entity9 in march — a move he failed to coordinate with the administration ' there are things you simply do n't do			1
he spat in our face publicly and that 's no way to behave			0
@entity7 ought to remember that president @entity19 has a year and a half left to his presidency , and that there will be a price , ' he said			1
fuming @entity42 leaders in @entity9 have said they were not consulted , raising questions over whether @entity3 had accurately characterized the nature of his invitation			0
the invitation was worded that way , a @entity3 spokesman said on friday , because ' @entity3 is the speaker of the whole @entity24 , elected by the whole @entity24			0
' @entity3 was re-elected as the chamber 's leader on jan. 6 with 216 votes , all from @entity5 , out of the 435 voting members of the @entity4			0
@entity54 , the @entity42 leader in the @entity56 , and @entity57 , his counterpart in the @entity24 , said they had not been told in advance of @entity3 's plan to invite @entity7			2
unwavering : in his address the @entity8 leader is expected to speak about stalled @entity2 - led nuclear negotiations with @entity64 , and to urge lawmakers to slap @entity66 with a new round of tougher sanctions the @entity24 also said that president @entity19 , a @entity69 , had not been told ahead of time and were said to be ' completely blindsided '			1
' the @entity71 has awesome power			0
i 've been there , ' @entity57 told her weekly news conference on thursday			0
' the fact , though , is that power is not to be squandered			0
' in announcing the invitation on wednesday , @entity3 called @entity7 ' a great friend of our country			0
' ' in this time of challenge , i am asking the prime minister to address @entity9 on the grave threats radical @entity87 and @entity64 pose to our security and way of life , ' he said			1
@entity42 congressional staffers called @entity3 's action a blatant political ploy			0
@entity7 is expected to back @entity5 moves to pressure @entity19 to take a tougher line in talks on a nuclear deal with @entity64			1
the prime minister is due to address @entity9 two weeks before @entity8 's general election on march 17 in which he is vying for a fourth term			1
@entity19 and other world leaders negotiating with @entity64 over its nuclear program have firmly argued against a sanctions bill from @entity9 , which they say would unravel a delicate international coalition and tank negotiations			1
' we asked the @entity8 in private and public to sit tight and the president made clear if a deal was n't reached he would be the first in line advocating for more sanctions , ' the official said			2
that 's what makes @entity7 's decision to address @entity9 a ' pretty big deal , ' the official added			1
the flap added to a growing perception that @entity7 's government has become a partisan @entity5 player in @entity2 politics , despite historically close ties to lawmakers in both parties			2
own agenda ? house speaker @entity3 invited @entity7 to speak to @entity9 without consulting the @entity19 administration @entity7 's continued expansion of @entity134 settlements in @entity135 has angered @entity2 officials , prompting one senior @entity24 official to call @entity138 a ' chicken * * * * ' @entity141 @entity5 @entity140 said the party was giving @entity19 a taste of his own medicine			1
in a hallway interview at the @entity146 , he termed the invitation ' a great idea ' after @entity19 's announcement that he would push ahead on policy without waiting to compromise with @entity9			2
' he basically said , ' i 'm going to do my thing , you do your thing			0
' we got it , we got the message , ' @entity140 said			0
the @entity24 announced that @entity19 wo n't meet with @entity7 during his visit because of the proximity to @entity8 elections			1
the visit could play well for @entity7 at home as he presents himself as the best protector of @entity8 's security			2
' the last thing we want to do is hurt @entity8 , but if he is able to stiff the @entity2 president like that and we still offer him a meeting -- that invites him and anyone else to do that over and over , ' a senior administration official told @entity173 .			2

administration has said it is **unhappy** with @entity8 prime minister @entity7 's plans to address @entity9
@entity8 leader **unhappy** with @entity2 stance on @entity64 's nuclear program
@entity7 was n't invited by president @entity19 and there was no coordination with the @entity24
@entity24 officials say @entity7 ' will *pay* price ' for the spat
@entity19 said to have asked him to tone down *pro-sanctions* *rhetoric*
