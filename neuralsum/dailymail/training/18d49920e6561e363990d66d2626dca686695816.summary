by @entity0 there were three main bands at @entity3 in 1974			1
there was @entity5 , who were studious types , and two vaguely political units known as @entity8 and @entity9			2
attend any left - leaning party or banner - filled occupation of a university building and it would be announced that the @entity8 or the @entity9 were about to entertain			1
all of them had a few numbers they ’d written themselves , so i had a crack at this caper and discovered it was harder than i ’d imagined			2
in a fortnight my song catalogue had only three entries — a weak , twinkly thing called @entity23 , a challenging rant called @entity25 and a fey and ineffectual dirge called i ’m @entity8 ( and you are the @entity28 )			2
rockin ' politico : @entity30 ( left ) and his friend @entity31 outside the @entity32 in @entity33 in 1972			1
mr @entity30 is showiong his bohemian side by eschewing shoes for one sparkling moment i thought they were classics and saw myself performing them in a halo of soft lighting , but when i tried one out on the @entity42 commune they suggested i stick to the bass			1
but the best possible thing happened : an old school friend called @entity47 dropped by to say he ’d formed a band that wanted to play covers and they had n’t got a bass guitarist			1
he had a beard and a mop of blond , shaggy hair and something shy and shrugging about him			2
‘ what are you called ? ’ i wondered			2
‘ @entity61 , ’ he shrugged			1
‘ why ? ’ ‘ because			2
’ and he gave me a quizzical look as if my knowledge of rock ’s outer reaches fell shamefully short of the mark ‘			2
because if you hold the cover of the @entity76 ’s from the @entity78 album upside - down in a mirror , the shapes in the stars spell the words “ @entity65 ”			2
so we ’re ugly rumors , ’ he shrugged , ‘ but in @entity68			2
’ loose band rehearsals took place in somebody ’s flat			1
@entity47 played rhythm guitar and brought some @entity87 lager			2
@entity88 played the drums and had a fur coat and a chipped front tooth and never surfaced till ‘ @entity92 ’			2
@entity93 was the frontman , a proper lead guitarist with a knotted scarf , studded biker jacket and a flailing curtain of hennaed hair			2
he lived in @entity98 , off @entity99 , which he referred to as @entity100			0
they never lose it : @entity30 plays the guitar with pupil @entity104 ( right ) , 15 , on saxophone on a visit to @entity107 we all had @entity110 - heeled cowboy boots and spent a rackety afternoon trying to master @entity111 by @entity113 weed - enthusiasts the @entity114 and @entity115			1
within a month we ’d cobbled together a set and played a couple of parties but nobody fancied singing			0
we took it in turns but this demanding activity interfered with the main point of being in any group which was posing expansively , waving at girls and wedging lighted ciggies under the top of your guitar strings like @entity131			0
ugly rumours needed someone out front			0
my friend @entity134 had an old mate at @entity137 called @entity30 , who ’d managed a band and appeared in revue shows , so we asked him to audition			1
‘ @entity145 ’ was pitching it a bit high and the moment he arrived , wearing the same boots as we had , he ’d effectively got the job			0
he had a folk - rock look — long hair with a fringe — and was keen , organised , quite posh , very funny and started a lot of sentences with the word ‘ guys ’			0
we ’d sent him the set - list so he ’d been up half the night with his ear pressed to a speaker transcribing the words and breezed in waving sheaves of handwritten lyrics			0
‘ guys , ’ he said , ‘ great selection ! where ’s the name from , @entity61 ? ’ docked four points : imagine not knowing that			1
there was some tutting and @entity47 had to fill him in			0
‘ any chance of doing @entity167 by @entity169 ? ’ @entity30 wondered			1
this was impressive : only the most insanely confident singer of a college rock band would dare suggest a ballad , let alone an obscure one			1
the audition got under way , two acoustic guitars , an unamplified bass , an upturned wastepaper basket and @entity30 emoting into a microphone that was n’t plugged in			1
he sang in high , fruity tones with the odd @entity183 move thrown in			0
we signed him up and charged off to @entity186 pub in @entity187 to drink to our glorious future			0
the five - piece @entity61 began appearing on the party circuit , @entity93 perfecting his gale - force solos and @entity30 adopting a courageous hoop - necked top that revealed several square inches of bare torso			1
the only tensions were the do - you - tuck - your - flares - into - your - cowboy - boots debates seconds before showtime , and the irritating sight of pretty girls gathered round the central mike - stand			0
’ @entity30 called us together after one show			1
‘ we ’re ok and everything but we could be so much better if we rehearsed ! ’ his level of enthusiasm was high even by my standards , and this was exceptionally keen			0
we played at a ball organised for the satirical @entity210			0
nobody threw anything , radical folk in suede shoes and military jackets clapped quite loudly and this whole ball business clearly got to @entity30			1
‘ listen , guys , you know these college balls that are 20 guineas a pop and have funfairs and slightly second - rate groups like @entity227 , right ? why do n’t we do an alternative one ? pints of beer , quid to get in , @entity61 top of the bill ? ’ the @entity230 was held on a cloudless june evening			1
@entity134 ( @entity231 who went on to become @entity30 ’s office ‘ gatekeeper ’ in @entity234 ) wore a billowy blue frock and a felt hat			1
@entity30 's gatekeeper : @entity231			1
she had an old mate at @entity240 called @entity30 , who ¿ d managed a band and appeared in revue shows , so he was asked him to audition the ticket included three bands , tins of lager , wine from bottles with plastic stoppers and saucers of @entity253 and @entity254			1
in an attempt to be ‘ far out ’ we ’d booked a string quartet to open the show — long - haired girls in flowing dresses — then a trad jazz band of old duffers in their 40s wearing straw hats and striped blazers			1
the idea was you could watch this cheesy , toe - tapping fare from the terrace while gearing up for the white heat of @entity61			1
two minutes ’ exposure to these brass - edged stompers and they were hurling themselves about in riotous abandon , blokes in @entity279 shirts jiving uncontrollably and girls cantering down the little paths among the flower - beds			0
they were going to be a hard act to follow			0
musical mates : @entity30 and @entity286 lead singer @entity285 my heart was pounding as we stood and watched			1
i looked at the five of us , a great heap of split - ends and fag ash in our skinny t - shirts and giant trousers			0
apart from @entity88 , we all had bare feet			0
we padded out nervously into the setting sun , squashing burning @entity298 into our guitar necks and placing bottles of warm @entity301 on the top of our amps			0
the cowbell started up for @entity305			0
we cranked up the riff and gave @entity30 the nod and he burst from behind a hedge doing his now fairly polished @entity183 impression — low - slung flares , bare midriff , one hand on a hip , the other wagging a cautionary finger , elbows flapping like a chicken			1
a couple of camp handclaps above his head and he pulled the microphone from its stand			0
‘ @entity323 awwwrright @entity230 , how are ya ? ’ they were fine , thanks , but a bit danced - out by the jazz band			1
‘ are you ready for some rock ’ n ’ roll ? ’ possibly , but they had to get their breath back first			0
and that beer was n’t going to drink itself			0
we gave it our best shot but the moment had passed			0
no matter how much @entity93 threw his hair about , or @entity30 said ‘ @entity339 ! ’ , or @entity88 whacked his cowbell while looking cool and distant , or @entity47 grinned bashfully and stamped on his effects pedals , we could n’t fill the lawn like the boater - sporting jazzers			1
@entity30 knew it , too , and made an announcement i do n’t remember discussing in the pre-gig huddle			1
‘ guys , we ’re going to try something different , ok ? ’ the crowd lowered their lager cans			0
‘ we ’re going to bring on the string quartet for a jam			0
and let ’s have a big hand for our brilliant jazz band , too			2
come on back up , guys ! ’ @entity359 jubilant shrieks of delight			0
what the hell was this ? in the interests of creating an ‘ alternative happening ’ , we were now lumbered with six pensionable goons in cricket blazers who were far better musicians than we were			0
it ’s after events like that , in the long sleepless hours of dawn , that even the most deluded would - be rock god in a college covers act tends to take a long , hard look at himself and ask some tough but quite reasonable questions			0
such as this : if i was the least talented member of the fourth - best covers group at a university , how was i ever going to make it as a musician ? whatever uncertain paths lay ahead of the five of us , they would n’t involve being in rock bands .			2

the real truth behind @entity61 , @entity30 's university band
invited to audition by @entity231 , who later worked for him at @entity392
wanted to sing a ballad and an obscure one at that
