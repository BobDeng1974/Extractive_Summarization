by @entity0 @entity2 vets have saved the sight of a blind lemur after conducting a first - of - its - kind operation on the animal to remove cataracts			1
keepers at @entity9 in @entity10 first noticed @entity11 , a four - year - old red - fronted brown lemur , had inflamed eyes in january - and within weeks he had been blinded by cataracts in both eyes			1
the normally social animal was left unable to interact with his troupe and had to use his memory to navigate round his cage , until he became trapped up a tree and had to be rescued			1
in the first operation of its kind on a lemur , vets @entity27 and @entity45 flew from the mainland and spent two hours painstakingly removing the cataracts last month			1
just six weeks later , @entity11 has made a remarkable recovery and is once again socialising with other primates at the animal park , including his parents @entity55 and @entity57			1
senior keeper @entity58 said : ' one morning we noticed he had a swollen eye and the pupil was massively dilated			2
' we monitored him and sent for help but over the next couple of weeks we were literally watching him going blind , which was very upsetting			0
examination : the vets had to put @entity11 under general anaesthetic to examine his eye so he would remain still pioneering : the vets work on the lemur during the surgery six weeks ago , from which he has now recovered back to normal : at one point @entity11 had to be locked in his enclosure after getting stuck up a tree endangered : lemurs are native only to @entity78 and are at increasing risk of extinction through habitat loss ' he was trying to use his memory to negotiate his way round the cage and eventually he got stuck up a tree , so we had to help him down and lock him in his enclosure to keep him safe			1
' at first we did n't know what was happening to him because he was so young - lemurs live for 25 years , and almost all documented cases happen in much older lemurs			2
' up and about : @entity11 the lemur after recovery with some similarities to cataract surgery on humans , the vets had to look through a microscope to carry out the operation using tiny instruments			1
they made a 3mm incision into the lemur 's eyes and cut out a small piece of the outside skin of the lens in each one , before liquifying it and ' sucking ' it out using ultrasound , the surgeons said			0
@entity27 , head of ophthalmology at the @entity38 , said : ' there is nothing quite like the feeling of restoring sight to an animal - especially witnessing them see again for the first time			1
it really is the best job in the world			0
' we were all quite nervous before the surgery and it was really important we got it right			0
' @entity126 , @entity127 â€™s head veterinarian , added : ' we approached @entity27 and @entity45 of the @entity38 as they specialise in animal ophthalmology and have considerable expertise in this very specific type of surgery			2
' the @entity38 also provided the specialist equipment required for the surgery including a phacoemulsification machine and operating microscope			0
' @entity127 has been working with the striking - looking primates for at least 50 years			2
they are native only to @entity78 where they are at risk of extinction in some areas due to habitat destruction , hunting and trapping for food and the pet trade			0
there are 106 known species of lemur , but 90 are classified as being near extinction because their numbers are so small			0
despite being a national symbol to many , the animals are the most hunted in @entity78 .			0

four - year - old animal @entity11 lost his sight at @entity9 , @entity10
two @entity2 vets flew from mainland to help in first operation of its kind
the same vets have helped elephants , bears , lions and eagles see again
