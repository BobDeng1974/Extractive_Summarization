' ' there 's a message in it which i 'm not happy about but it still suggests there 's a reason they are being targeted			0
' there 's never an endorsement of the attack but nothing else on the day can be considered even slightly violent			0
' ' i do n't even think it 's right to apologise for these individuals because every protest that you watch , there will be an obligatory that one idiot will smash a shop window			1
