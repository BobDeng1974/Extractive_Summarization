by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 5 august 2013 @entity2 paleontologists have discovered a new species of prehistoric shark , complete with devilish horns and sinfully sharp teeth			2
the shark , named @entity8 or @entity9 , was extracted from a piece of limestone in @entity12 , @entity13			1
scientists at @entity15 believe it was an incredibly tough species that survived the @entity20 @entity19 extinction - the world 's largest extinction event			2
a simple reconstruction of @entity8 or @entity9 that was extracted from a piece of limestone in @entity12 , @entity13 in this event , commonly known as ' the @entity26 ' a staggering 96 per cent of life on @entity28 was wiped out			1
as the name might suggest , the @entity31 shark had incredibly sharp teeth as well as hook - shaped spikes on its head , which are thought to have evolved for defense of even sexual selection			0
the spikes could have evolved to catch the eye of devil tooth sharks of the opposite sex , just as some animals use them to find a mate today			0
the fearsome creature was plucked from the @entity47 in @entity13 and details of the fossil were published in the @entity50 and @entity51 , @entity52 reported			0
the scientists believe the fish lived 260 million years ago and was a hybodont , or hump - toothed shark			1
@entity8 had incredibly sharp teeth ( its rear teeth are pictured ) as well as spikes on its head , which are thought to have evolved for defense of even sexual selection			0
the spikes could have evolved to catch the eye of devil tooth sharks of the opposite sex , just as some animals use them to find a mate today this group of sharks is now extinct but were close ancestors of modern sharks , according to @entity15 post-graduate @entity71 , who was lead author of the study			2
' hybodont sharks evolved during the late @entity75 - approximately 300 million years ago - and miraculously survived the @entity20 @entity19 extinction event into the @entity77 , ' he said			1
the @entity31 shark terrorised the seas for around 50 million years and lived into the ' age of reptiles ' 252 million years ago			1
as well as the hook - like horns on its head , the fish sported spines on the front and back of its fins as well as the asymmetric tail associated with most modern sharks			1
mr @entity71 describe the shark 's teeth as advanced and said they were : ' well developed pointed cusps with slight cutting edges , a feature which was not seen until later hybodonts during the beginning of the @entity77			0
' judging by the size of its teeth , the @entity8 tooth shark was around three - and - a - half feet long - slightly smaller than a leopard shark ( pictured )			0
mr @entity71 believes the predator 's hunting style might have been similar too as it is thought @entity8 searched for small fish and soft - bodied marine creature to eat judging by the size of its teeth , the well - equipped predator was around three - and - a - half feet long , which is slightly smaller than a leopard shark			1
mr @entity71 believes that the creature 's hunting style might have been similar to its modern spotty cousin as it is thought @entity8 sharks searched for small fish and soft - bodied marine creature to eat as well as possibly extra sea life living in coastal waters midway to the surface			1
the plains where the fossil was found were once a shallow sea that bordered a great desert some 270 million years ago			2
@entity71 said : ' at this time the ancestors of modern sharks were just starting to diversify , but remained small			0
' however on dry land , reptiles , dinosaurs , birds and mammals were diversifying at a greater pace .			0

@entity2 *archaeologists* discovered @entity8 or @entity9 in the @entity47 of @entity131 , @entity13
scientists at @entity15 believe the *3.5* ft fish survived ' the @entity26 ' , which wiped out 96 *%* of life on @entity28
the creature lived 260 million years ago and was a hump - toothed shark with a *distinctive* asymmetric fin similar to modern sharks
