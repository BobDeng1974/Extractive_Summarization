‘ around 10,000 people have already had to wait longer than the recommended 62 days to start their treatment this year			1
‘ furthermore , there has been a ten-fold increase over the last year in the number of hospital trusts where patients with suspected cancer are waiting longer than two weeks to be seen by a specialist			1
‘ this shows that the current system simply is n’t working and people with cancer are being badly let down			0

' over the last five years we have seen a 51 per cent increase in the number of patients referred within two weeks for suspected cancer symptoms , which is good news for improving early diagnosis and survival			1
‘ we continue to treat the vast majority of patients within a month of deciding treatment is needed and it is imperative that we focus on maintaining waiting times standards as demand for care increases			0
