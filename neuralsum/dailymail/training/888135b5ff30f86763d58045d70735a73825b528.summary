by @entity0 it is bad news for budding athletes - all the practice in the world will not make you a world class sprinter if you are n't quick to begin with			2
researchers say the best sprinters in the world were exceptionally fast prior to beginning formal training			1
the finding contradicts the popular theory that 10,000 hours practice can make you an expert in anything - including sports			1
researchers say sprinters such as @entity19 ( pictured ) are exceptionally fast even before they begin formal training			1
the popular ' practice ' model of expertise has been championed by social scientists including @entity24			2
according to this model , there is no such thing as innate talent			0
instead , 10 years of deliberate practice ( roughly 10,000 hours ) are necessary and sufficient for anyone to become an expert in any field , including sports			1
the researchers say they hope their work will ' finally put an end to the debate ' and prove the theory is wrong - for sports , at least			2
published in the online journal @entity42 , @entity40 researchers studied biographies of 26 world - class sprinters , including 15 olympic gold medalists and the eight fastest men in @entity48 history			1
the research , conducted by @entity50 , professor of biology , and @entity52 , associate professor of psychology , shows that the developmental histories of elite sprinters contradict the popular ' practice ' model of expertise championed by @entity24			2
according to this model , there is no such thing as innate talent			0
instead , 10 years of deliberate practice ( roughly 10,000 hours ) are necessary and sufficient for anyone to become an expert in any field , including sports			1
the researchers studied biographies of 26 world - class sprinters , including 15 olympic gold medalists and the eight fastest men in @entity48 history			1
the first major finding was that every expert sprinter , male or female , was recognized as exceptionally fast prior to beginning formal training			1
this contradicts the deliberate practice model , which assumes that initial performance and final performance in a domain will be unrelated			2
a second key finding was that , contrary to the 10 - year rule , most sprinters achieved world class performances in less than five years , and more than half of the @entity45 champions reached this level in three years or fewer			1
' we expected that most sprint champions ’ biographies would indicate that they were always the fastest kid in their neighborhood , even before they did any formal training or received any coaching , ' said @entity50			2
' but the consistency of the pattern was surprising – from @entity94 , a 1936 @entity95 , to @entity19 , there were no exceptions			0
' gathering the data systematically allowed us to see how strong the patterns were			0
' it also allowed us to test and rule out alternative explanations			0
' researchers studied 26 world - class sprinters , including 15 olympic gold medalists and the eight fastest men in @entity48 history			1
in addition , @entity50 and @entity52 surveyed 64 sprinters and throwers ( i.e. , shot put , javelin , discus ) who qualified for the 2012 @entity113 collegiate track and field outdoor championships			0
sprinters recalled being faster as children , while throwers recalled greater strength and overhand throwing ability			0
another key finding was that the collegiate sprinters ’ best performances in their first season of high school competition , generally the beginning of formal training or deliberate practice , were consistently faster than 95 - 99 percent of their peers			1
' our results wo n’t come as a surprise to most biologists , sports scientists , or coaches — all of the previous data pointed to this conclusion , ' said @entity52			0
' but our results are important because the deliberate practice model and its ‘ 10 - year rule ’ remains enormously popular among many social scientists and intellectuals			0
' our results are clear - cut and should require no scientific training to understand			0
' so we hope they will finally put an end to the debate			0
' in sports , innate talent is required too .			0

contradicts theory that 10,000 hours practice can make you an expert in anything
researchers studied 26 world - class sprinters , including 15 olympic gold medalists and the eight fastest men in @entity48 history
all were exceptionally fast prior to beginning formal training
were able to reach @entity45 level within three years in some cases
