it would be difficult to argue that @entity1 has got the most out of his @entity3 squad after spending Â£ 150million on new players last summer			2
@entity6 boss @entity5 criticised @entity3 's long - ball style following sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity9 , a game in which @entity11 rescued a point for the visitors in added time			1
@entity3 have looked unbalanced at times this season , while @entity18 's decision to drop @entity19 into midfield as @entity22 and @entity23 struggle continues to confuse			1
so with @entity3 coming under pressure to find the right formula , @entity25 's experts have picked the starting xis they believe would be most effective , regardless of injuries or suspensions			2
@entity3 captain @entity19 has been used in midfield for much of this season @entity1 defended his tactics against @entity6 in his pre-match press conference on tuesday @entity33 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ; @entity42 , @entity19 ; @entity43 the back four here contains the squad 's two natural full - backs and its two best nuts and bolts central defenders			1
@entity39 needs a chance in midfield and his selection allows @entity19 to be pushed further up the field			0
@entity43 is on borrowed time but remains @entity3 's best finisher			2
striker @entity22 , pictured scoring against @entity57 , has struggled to hit top form this season @entity39 , pictured coming on for @entity59 , has made just six @entity60 starts this season @entity61 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) @entity34 ; @entity62 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity11 , @entity40 ; @entity63 , @entity42 , @entity64 ; @entity19 @entity18 will spend 90 minutes with his hands over his eyes whatever defence he picks , but at least @entity37 looks increasingly solid			1
blind looks decent in the centre and @entity40 can keep things ticking over alongside him in the engine room			0
@entity11 , pictured celebrating against @entity6 , has been a calming influence in @entity3 's midfield this team relies on the attacking value sand principles of the club , turning to wingers - @entity63 and @entity64 - and create from both sides			1
then it 's up to @entity19 to score the goals			0
@entity43 and @entity23 can wait for it all to go wrong on the bench before @entity18 throws them on in desperation			2
@entity64 ( left ) tussles with @entity6 's @entity86 during @entity3 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity9 @entity88 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity34 ; @entity89 , @entity62 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity40 , @entity41 ; @entity63 , @entity19 , @entity42 ; @entity43			1
a flat back - four ( ideally with a new right - sided centre - back sooner rather than later ) , @entity19 in a more advanced role , the right pegs in the right holes			0
former @entity94 midfielder @entity63 has found himself in and out of @entity18 's starting xi this season @entity59 , pictured celebrating against @entity96 in september , has struggled for form after a fine start @entity99 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity40 , @entity41 ; @entity42 , @entity100 , @entity63 ; @entity19 @entity101 of all @entity19 needs to play in his best position as a central striker , given that @entity23 and @entity22 are in wretched form			1
@entity100 's height and physical strength would be effective against @entity109 's direct probing , not to mention being useful at the other end of the pitch			0
@entity63 is an excellent player and deserves a chance ahead of @entity39			0
@entity111 midfielder @entity100 ( left ) has been used as an impact substitute by @entity18 at times @entity114 , pictured making a save against @entity6 , is the undoubted no 1 goalkeeper at @entity3 @entity117 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity62 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity118 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity19 , @entity43 it 's flawed but it 's balanced and in a straightforward system that everyone should understand			1
there 's pace out wide , control in the centre and two goal scorers up front with the intelligence to react if an extra body is required in midfield			0
ideally , it would be stronger at the back and there fouls be more energy in the centre but the squad is off kilter			0
@entity118 ( right ) has admitted struggling with the defensive duties given to him by @entity18 this season @entity38 ( right ) , pictured tackling @entity140 's @entity139 , is included in each of @entity25 's @entity141 @entity142 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity19 ; @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity23 i desperately tried to fit @entity42 , @entity19 , @entity23 and @entity43 into the team - and i think i 've managed it			1
i 've slotted @entity19 into midfield - but with the license to push forward when @entity3 are in possession			2
the balance of this side is probably all wrong , it would concede goals			0
but they 'd score a few , too			0
on - loan striker @entity23 celebrates a rare goal against @entity57 at @entity155 in january @entity40 ( second from left ) has been one of @entity3 's top performers under the tutelage of @entity18			1

@entity1 has defended his style after criticism from @entity5
@entity3 struggled to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity6 on sunday
@entity19 has been playing in central midfield , while strikers @entity23 and @entity22 are out of form
@entity18 has used a variety of formations and players so far this season
