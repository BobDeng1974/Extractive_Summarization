with @entity12 soldiers away in @entity16 , war - hit families were issued with an urgent plea to invite their @entity10 colleagues to share their @entity20 celebrations			1
faced with the prospect of their guests bringing extra food with them , families jumped at the chance to welcome the @entity10 into their homes , with some 50 invitations being offered for every gi , or @entity28			1
festive cheer : with @entity12 soldiers away in @entity16 , war - hit families were issued with an urgent plea to invite their @entity10 colleagues to share their @entity20 celebrations celebrations : @entity20 hands out toys and games , including a set of building bricks , to children at a home for evacuees in @entity40 - on - @entity41 for troops serving in a foreign land , far away from home , @entity20 was a difficult time			1
around 60,000 had reached @entity45 by december , with the majority being stationed in @entity47 , where they had been tasked with building airfields for @entity10 planes			0
as many soldiers and airmen as possible were given the day off , and advised to spend the day with @entity12 families , ' filling the chairs left empty by @entity12 fighting men '			2
posters were put up around bases bearing the message : ' gis spend your @entity20 at home with a @entity12 family '			1
the soldiers who took up the invitations were given special ration packs to share with their guests , containing sought - after items such as fruit juice , evaporated milk , bacon , coffee sugar , rice , peas and lard			1
partying gift : a reveller says goodbye to a crew of @entity58 after a 1942 @entity77 thrown in their honour far from home : @entity10 troops settling into their accommodation hut in southern @entity82 time to relax : two @entity12 - based gis kick back with a well - earned beer war and rationing had brought many changes to familiar festive rituals in @entity45 , and @entity20 celebrations often had to be scaled down or adjusted as restrictions and shortages took hold			1
as even the most basic foods were scarce , festive luxuries were hard to come by			0
gifts were often homemade and practical and childrenâ € ™ s toys often made from recycled materials			0
with the extra food on offer , perhaps it was not a surprise when so many invitations were extended that in 1942 a @entity10 camp commander revealed ' the ration is estimated at 50 invitations for every one soldier available			2
' party time : @entity10 soldiers dancing at @entity110 , the @entity111 club for @entity10 troops in @entity113 all aboard : @entity10 soldiers driving through the streets of @entity113 in 1942			1
their average salaries were more than five times that paid to @entity12 soldiers he urged more gis about to spend their first @entity20 in @entity45 to come forward ' and accept some more of those invitations '			1
one @entity28 recalled in historian @entity123 's book @entity124 , @entity125 , and @entity126 : the @entity10 gi in @entity45 , how he was invited to spend @entity20 at the home of a woman in the @entity129			1
he had arrived on a bicycle , laden down with his rations of spam , powdered coffee , chocolate and soap , along with other items from his camp stores			0
' we all sat down to a @entity20 dinner and scene that might have made @entity142 the only true recorder ' , he said			0
new friends : @entity12 major general @entity144 plays ' oranges and lemons ' with @entity113 children at a party for @entity10 soldiers in 1942 determined : the threat of bombs did not stop the crowds doing their @entity20 shopping in the famous @entity153 , @entity113 during the war ' i donâ € ™ t recall what we had for dinner , but at long last the plum pudding was served â € “ and i gained the silver sixpence			1
' along with their rations the @entity58 were also responsible for bringing many festive traditions into @entity12 homes , including @entity20 crackers , while in exchange the @entity166 introduced their guests to @entity170 calenders and @entity170 candles			2
as in peacetime , a prominent feature of a war - time @entity20 was singing songs and carols , and from 1939 onwards the @entity173 's special @entity77 radio programming would include a speech by the @entity180 , an event which became an annual ritual and continues to this day			2
the @entity10 would also help @entity12 families to forget their wartime woes by throwing lavish parties at their @entity187 and @entity188 bases , inviting local school children to join in their festivities			1
war orphans were the guests of honour when the @entity187 soldiers of the @entity194 held a party for the children at the @entity198 @entity197 at @entity200 's estate at @entity201 , @entity202			2
party time : for many young children away from home @entity20 was a difficult time , especially for these evacuees who were cheered up by a visit from @entity20 for these young children @entity20 could be a particularly difficult time , as they were not only spending the holidays away from home , but they had also lost a parent - either in action , or as a result of enemy bombing raids			2
one former guest of a party in @entity218 recalled how a @entity20 party was thrown for school children in the @entity221 and the youngsters each given a gift from @entity224 - who had an @entity10 accent			2
' the @entity58 had decorated the interior with lots of flags , @entity226 , together with tinsel and paper chains , ' he said			0
' they served an immense amount of food , not only the cakes , jellies and blancmange but many sweet dishes that we had n't seen for ages due to rationing			0
' keen to decorate their vast bases , the @entity58 would hang ' chaff ' , strips of metallic foil thrown from their aircraft to confuse @entity247 radar , from trees , as well as more traditional items like coloured lights and streamers			0
lasting legacy : @entity28 brides and their babies get ready to fly to @entity10 for christmas 1946			0
unfortunately , their flight was turned back because of bad weather			0
these women and their children had to wait for another opportunity to reach their new home			0
when the @entity58 arrived on @entity12 shores in 1942 , bringing with them sought - after @entity4 , cigarettes , chewing gum and nylons there was initially distrust between the @entity166 and the @entity58			0
their average salaries were more than five times that paid to @entity12 soldiers and their generosity made them particularly attractive to women			0
around 70,000 @entity12 women became @entity28 brides , although it was estimated that around 9,000 war babies were born out of wedlock as a result of the @entity58 liaisons			0
after the war the @entity12 gi wives were offered a free passage by the @entity187 to start their new lives in @entity10 , although the journey was not so simple for the group of women preparing to fly across the @entity284 for christmas 1946			1
four years after the first gis found themselves far from home in the @entity12 , the @entity12 women found themselves in the same predicament as their flight was turned back because of bad weather , and they had to wait for another opportunity to reach their new home			0
by the time the war was over around three million @entity10 soldiers had spent time in @entity45 , and were frequently described as being ' overpaid , oversexed and over here ' .			1

@entity10 soldiers were *encouraged* to spend @entity20 with brits who saw them as @entity296 come latelys to war
