four - year - old @entity0 was bitten up to 25 times in a vicious dog attack a mother has slammed police who refused to investigate a vicious dog attack after the animal jumped into her car and attacked her four - year - old daughter			1
@entity10 , 38 , was driving along a country lane in @entity12 , @entity13 , when she saw a @entity15 terrier in the @entity16 and got out to shoo it to safety			1
but as she did , it leapt in through her door and daughter @entity21 was frantically bitten 25 times on her arms , legs and face , as her terrified 12 - year - old brother @entity26 looked on in shock			1
the mother - of - four , from @entity29 in @entity13 , was able to get the dog out of the car and reported the incident to the police but claims she was told it was her ' responsibility ' for letting the dog in			1
it was only after mrs @entity37 sent letters , photographs and then lodged an official complaint against @entity42 that police even recorded the crime			1
she said : ' the dog was on top of her , mauling her , and she was just screaming			0
' when i managed to get her out the car and into my arms he was jumping up and with every jump he bit her again and again			0
' at one point the dog was actually hanging off her bottom and i had to punch it to unlock its jaw			0
' how can they say that a dog mauling a four - year - old girl is not a case ? i 've lost all faith in the police			2
' she added that the dog initially seemed friendly and she had left it in the car while she went to knock on a nearby door to find the owner			2
it was while she was walking back to the car that she heard blood - curdling screams and sprinted to the vehicle to find the dog attacking her four - year - old daughter			2
@entity21 was in her mother 's car when the @entity15 jumped in through the door and started biting her ' my heart just dropped , ' she said			1
' she was screaming , i was screaming , and @entity26 was just in complete shock			0
' it went on for about three to four minutes with the dog just biting her while i tried to hold her above my chest , but it felt like a lifetime			0
it bit her , i would say , 20 to 25 times			0
' the dog eventually stopped when another driver arrived on the scene and used a belt to restrain the pet , and hunted for the owner			0
mrs @entity37 , who was also bitten , and @entity21 were taken to @entity98 for tetanus injections and antibiotics , and medics steri - stripped her wounds			1
but while taking her husband , @entity103 , home she claims officers told the 40 - year - old electrician there was no case to answer - before officially interviewing anyone involved			2
she sustained injuries to her face , legs ( left ) , hip ( right ) and arms before she was rushed to @entity98 for tetanus injections and antibiotics			0
medics had to steri - strip her wounds ' he said first of all once a dog got into my car that was my responsibility , ' she said			2
' i told him ' i do n't think so '			2
' then after he said he would look into it he said to me " we do n't know what happened in that car , you daughter could have been teasing it , there 's no case "			0
' i said " excuse me , have you asked my daughter ? no. she 's still in bits "			0
' it was absolutely awful and the fact i had to lodge an official complaint to get it investigated is disgusting			1
' after more than two weeks of apparently ignored emails to officers , mrs @entity37 lodged an official complaint and a senior inspector took on the case			1
@entity10 , right , with her daughter			1
she had got out her car to help shoo the dog to safety when it jumped in and began attacking @entity21 , while her terrified 12 - year - old brother watched on in shock gamekeeper @entity150 , 50 , was eventually charged and he pleaded guilty to two counts of owning a dog which caused injury while dangerously out of control			1
the court ordered the @entity15 terrier , called @entity157 , should be destroyed and he was told to pay £ 2,000 compensation to the family			1
that included £ 1,500 to traumatised @entity21 , £ 300 to mrs @entity37 and £ 200 to @entity26			2
a spokesman from @entity42 said : ' when this incident was first reported to police , the initial assessment of the officer who attended was that no criminal offences had taken place			0
' a subsequent review of the circumstances found that the case warranted further police investigation , and as a result the owner of the dog was reported for a summons to court			0
' we hope that the victims are happy with the outcome of the court hearing and regret any distress caused over the initial handling of this case , which is currently being reviewed			0
