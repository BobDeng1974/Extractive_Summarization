but now @entity16 @entity15 has finally found somewhere to spend his perk – a six - bedroom £ 3million property			1
expensive taste : the designer kitchen renting : @entity15 and @entity21 the landlords have spent £ 1million transforming a semi-detached house from three flats into a single luxury dwelling			1

the master bedroom suite is laid out over 600sq ft and includes a huge dressing room and a marble bathroom with his - and - hers sinks			0
downstairs , the designer kitchen has sliding doors leading out to the garden and a spiral staircase and cellar			0
for mr @entity15 , who has four daughters , the fact that the house also has five bathrooms was surely a clincher			1
the property has no air - conditioning – a bête noire of eco-conscious mr and mrs @entity21			0
there is even an adjoining flat with its own entrance that can be used as guest accomodation			0
luxury : one of the five bathrooms in the @entity7 mansion the @entity61 , both 48 , have not moved into the house yet			2

after tax , it works out as £ 11,041 a month towards his rent which is believed to be nearly £ 15,000 per month			2
last night @entity80 mp @entity79 , a member of the treasury select committee , said : ‘ it ’s extraordinary that we are paying for him to have this big house			2
ordinary people who have to fund their own rent out of their own wages will wonder why they have to pay his rent as well			0
he is leading the charge for wage austerity in public and the private sector , and this makes people think he is from a different world			0
’ light and airy : the master bedroom also boasts a huge dressing room @entity99 , of the @entity100 ’ @entity98 , added : ‘ most people have to pay the rent from their own salary so mr @entity15 ’s taxpayer - funded mansion is sure to raise eyebrows			1
politicians must hold him and his pay package to account so taxpayers judge for themselves whether he is worth all this money			0
’ but leading @entity111 peer @entity110 said : ‘ my view is , if he sorts the economy out , it ’s worth every penny			0
