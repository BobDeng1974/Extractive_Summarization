on the heels of an announcement that @entity3 would offer a standalone version of its streaming service , @entity0 announced it was rolling out its own			0
the network launched @entity7 on thursday , offering live and on - demand shows that can be streamed through apps and on the @entity0 website			1
though @entity11 hails the move as the tv industry weaning itself off of cable providers , @entity0 says it considers the @entity7 service a supplement to what the network offers on tv			2
demand : @entity0 says its @entity7 service is for the ' super-fans ' who want more content , not to challenge cable providers like @entity24 ' it â€™s about super-fans being able to get a lot more of our content , ' said @entity0 ceo @entity30			2
the service is similar to what @entity32 already offers current subscribers of the premium cable channel			0
@entity0 @entity7 customers will be able to watch on - demand episodes of shows like @entity39 or stream shows at the same time they air on television			1
there are also comparisons to @entity44 , the streaming service airing network television without paying programming fees , that was sued into near non-existence by the networks			0
the biggest difference between what customers get on tv and what they get on their @entity54 is that @entity7 will not stream @entity55 on @entity0 coverage because it does not have a deal with the league			1
customers will also need to be within one of the 14 cities where @entity0 owns a local station , limiting the service mainly to metropolitan areas like @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
good deal ? @entity0 announced customers of @entity70 would be able to stream live and on - demand shows like @entity72 through its $ 6 a month service for those who hate television ads , @entity0 says that the $ 6 - a - month service will stream older on - demand shows ad free and has cut down the frequency of ads 25 percent on newer shows			1
it 's not a given that the service will pull in a significant share of customers looking to pay for @entity0 shows when they air for free or come bundled with cable subscriptions			0
the @entity0 audience is currently older than that of other networks , which means they watch most of their live television on the television			0
recode notes @entity95 , which airs @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 shows on - demand , has 6 million subscribers , though that subscription also offers basic cable programming such as @entity102 .			0
