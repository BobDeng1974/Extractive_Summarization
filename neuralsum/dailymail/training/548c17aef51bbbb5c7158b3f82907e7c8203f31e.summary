by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:35 am on 20th december 2011 a woman is facing a race against time to lose four stone - in order to become pregnant before her husband dies			2
@entity7 , 24 hopes to have a child with her husband @entity9 , 28 , who suffers from chronic organ failure			1
doctors have told former shop worker mr @entity12 he only has five months to live			2
final wish : terminally ill @entity12 , hopes his wife @entity15 will have started @entity17 treatment before he dies however , the couple have a million - to - one chance of conceiving naturally , as @entity15 has polycystic ovaries and @entity9 ’s sperm count has been reduced by years of daily medication and operations			1
childcare assistant @entity15 , from @entity24 , has lost a stone - and - a - half so far through joining a slimming club and exercising			2
she said : ' the news was devastating , but we ’re concentrating on fulfilling the dreams we have together			0
' i ’ve already lost more than a stone through @entity32 , but i still have three and a half stone to go			2
' i want to get the weight lost by march next year , which will hopefully give @entity9 time to realise that the procedures have worked and he ’s on his way to becoming a dad			1
' @entity9 has been through a series of operations throughout his life to correct @entity42 , a condition which has left his heart unable to pump blood properly			1
he married @entity15 in february 2007 - and underwent a double transplant to replace his faulty heart and lungs a month later			0
but last month he was given the tragic news that his body is now rejecting the organs - giving him just six months to live			0
becoming a father is at the top of @entity9 's ' bucket list ' - a wishlist of experiences he 'd like to have before he dies			1
@entity9 and @entity7 on their wedding day in february 2007 : he underwent a double transplant a month later but his body is now rejecting the new heart and lungs he said : ' we have been thinking about having a baby for around three years , but with everything else going on , we just have n’t been able to concentrate on it properly			1
' now there is more need to get the @entity17 underway as soon as @entity69 i may not be around to hold my child , as long as i know the @entity17 has started and @entity15 is alright , it will mean the world to me			2
' couples need to meet strict criteria to be considered for @entity17 and at 19 - and - a - half stone @entity15 was judged to be too overweight			0
the national @entity17 success rate is around 30 per cent - meaning @entity15 and @entity9 face a daunting challenge even if she does manage to slim to 14 - and - half stone			1
she has already lost a stone and a half , taking her weight to 18 stone , but must lose at least three and a half more to qualify for the treatment			2
' these past five years have been the best			0
@entity9 is the most wonderful person i have ever met and he ’s changed my life , ' @entity15 said			1
' if it was n’t for the transplant , we would not have had this time together			0
now i have the most powerful incentive imaginable to lose weight			0
' @entity9 has also joined in @entity15 ’s diet to help give her encouragement			1
he said : ' i ’m doing all the things a normal supportive husband would do			2
i ’m eating what she ’s eating , which makes it easier for her			0
' whenever i catch her reaching for sweet treats , i give her a little smack on the hand			0
' it ’s been helpful to concentrate on achieving this together			0
it ’s been nice to have something to occupy our minds			0
' @entity9 drew up his bucket list earlier this year as his condition worsened			1
he also hopes to swim with sharks , visit the set of @entity111 and meet hero @entity112			0
but he added : ' having a son or daughter would be a wonderful thing to leave to our families - it would be a part of me which would continue living after i ’m gone			0
' @entity9 and @entity15 are hoping that their plight will help inspire others to sign up for the organ donor register			1
