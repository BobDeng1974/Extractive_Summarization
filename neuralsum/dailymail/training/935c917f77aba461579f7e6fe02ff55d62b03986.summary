by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 expresses the point succinctly			2
the @entity4 defender , who takes on @entity5 and @entity6 on monday , knows there is a degree of impatience in @entity10 as @entity12 ’s national team begin their @entity14 campaign in @entity15			1
in recent tournaments , @entity10 have been playing the unfamiliar role of eager young hopefuls			1
in 2006 , as host nation , they feared they would be chronically embarrassed at their own party , yet they ended up heroic losers in an epic semi-final with @entity27			2
in 2010 , the young team that ripped apart @entity29 in @entity30 , with @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 to the fore , was full of @entity14 debutants who were stopped only by the irresistible @entity39 , again in the semi-final			2
holding court : per @entity1 addresses his @entity43 team - mates during training last week crunch : @entity1 ( right ) challenges @entity46 during @entity10 's 6 - 1 win over @entity48 young guns : @entity32 jumps on @entity31 as @entity10 beat @entity29 in @entity50 in 2010 today ’s players have no such mitigation should they fail			1
they are no longer a team for the future ; this generation have to deliver now			2
‘ we finished the last two @entity57 in third position and that is really consistent , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ what we need in @entity10 after all these years is a title as well			1
we ’re talking all about titles and trophies			2
it is 1996 since they last delivered a trophy , winning the @entity67 at @entity68			2
granted , in the intervening years they have reached the @entity14 final in 2002 and semis in 2006 and 2010 , as well as reaching the @entity73 final and @entity74 semi-final			1
what @entity29 would give for failure on that scale ? nevertheless , this team are now experienced tournament players , many of them @entity81 winners			1
‘ the level of this team is really high and that comes with experience , ’ says @entity82 , @entity1 ’s @entity4 team - mate			1
in 2006 , levels of expectation were n’t so high			0
other teams look at us differently			0
in 2006 and 2010 we were the hunters ; now we ’re the hunted			0
’ confident : @entity4 team - mates @entity82 ( left ) and @entity1 believe @entity10 can do well the captain remains the unflappable @entity92 , who has been transformed from a full - back into an outstanding holding midfielder under @entity94 at @entity95			1
‘ i like the fact that expectations are so high , ’ says @entity92			0
‘ firstly , it ’s normal : we ’ve had two third - place finishes and we have to try to improve on that in @entity102			1
this team have been together for a long time , we have come very far			0
‘ of course they want us to win the @entity14 back home			0
maybe it would be easier for us if there were no expectations , if we were able to play with a sense of freedom			0
but that ’s not our reality			0
i ’d much rather be considered one of the favourites than one of the underdogs			0
’ @entity95 boys : @entity92 and @entity119 ( right ) are part of strong @entity95 contingent in the @entity10 squad @entity92 is part of the core of @entity95 players , which includes @entity32 , @entity126 and , more recently , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity119 , who were gaining a reputation as gallant losers			1
with their country they lost the @entity73 final , 2010 @entity14 and @entity74 semis ; with their club they had been defeated in the 2010 and 2012 @entity81 finals			0
when the big games came , @entity95 ’s @entity10 players seemed to be serial losers			1
so the all - @entity43 2013 @entity81 final between @entity95 and @entity141 at @entity68 was hugely significant			2
@entity95 ’s players ended their losing run and @entity1 agrees that @entity10 ’s rise in prowess in the @entity81 has made a considerable difference to the national team			1
‘ @entity148 achieved by reaching three finals in four years is adorable , ’ he adds			0
‘ five or 10 years ago there was a massive gap between @entity10 and the leading @entity81 countries			1
’ defining moment : @entity95 celebrate beating @entity141 to win the 2013 @entity81 final as well @entity6 and @entity155 , @entity10 also face the @entity156 , now coached by @entity157 , their former manager			1
@entity157 gave mertesacker his debut and recruited @entity12 as no 2 , pushing his assistant to take his job when he left			1
mertesacker adds : ‘ for those who were together with @entity157 over a couple of years , it ’s going to be a very special game			0
he gave us our confidence back			0
this @entity43 side needed @entity157 when he started in 2004 and then in 2006			2
‘ a lot of memories will come back when we face him			0
i am looking forward to it			0
everyone is grateful that we spent time with him			0
