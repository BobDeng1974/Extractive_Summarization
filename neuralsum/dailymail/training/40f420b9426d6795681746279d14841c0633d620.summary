by @entity0 last updated at 1:21 am on 5th february 2012 the rift in the @entity2 over the prosecution of former energy secretary @entity4 was laid bare last night as his ex-wife @entity5 welcomed ‘ @entity7 ’ guests to a party held annually at the couple ’s home			1
the party , which was co-hosted by the couple until their split in 2010 , highlighted how their mutual friends have been forced to choose which ‘ camp ’ to join – an issue of divided loyalties that will be thrown into sharp relief by the upcoming court case			1
@entity21 - born @entity20 , 57 , shrugged off her worries to welcome high - profile allies to her £ 2.5 million townhouse in @entity25 , @entity26			1
divided : the party came a day after @entity20 ( left ) and mr @entity4 ( right ) were charged with perverting the course of justice the party came just a day after mr @entity4 , 57 , and @entity20 were both charged with perverting the course of justice over claims that he had used her name to escape speeding penalty points			2
he strongly denies the charges			0
more than 100 guests had received invites with their @entity42 cards to the annual ‘ post-davos ’ celebration			0
miss @entity5 , a high - flying economist , has numerous friends who attend the meeting of the political and business elite in the @entity49 resort at the end of january			1
most of the couple ’s mutual friends sided with @entity20 in the immediate aftermath of the split because they felt she had been badly treated by mr @entity4 when he left her for his assistant @entity55 , 45			1
allies : @entity58 's wife @entity57 ( left ) offered support to @entity20 while @entity60 ( right ) is also supporting @entity4 's ex-wife however , miss @entity5 ’s subsequent actions , including making claims about the speeding offence , have reportedly led some of them to moderate their support			1

’ points : how the @entity4 speeding case has been reported business secretary @entity84 and mr @entity4 ’s replacement as energy secretary , @entity86 , are also regarded as supporters			0
‘ @entity92 ’ is less colourful and less numerous – reflecting the former cabinet minister ’s reputation for having few friends in politics			2
apart from ms @entity55 , 57 , mr @entity4 can count on @entity2 president and ally @entity93 , who this weekend described him as ‘ the grit in the oyster ’ in the @entity97			0
mr @entity93 said : ‘ the reason why he was on the negotiating team at the formation of the @entity97 , i was told by someone who shall remain unnamed , was because “ @entity4 is a thug ” and that he is someone who could go into the room and just negotiate a position and get the best possible outcome			0
‘ i hope he ’ll be proved innocent			0
i hope he comes back very quickly			0
’ mr @entity4 can also rely on home office minister @entity106 – who chaired his leadership campaign in 2007 – pensions minister @entity108 and controversial @entity110 mp @entity109			0
