by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:42 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 4 november 2013 president @entity2 has largely dismissed the disastrous launch of healthcare.gov by insisting that consumers can also apply for health insurance on the telephone or via paper applications , but internal notes revealed today show the @entity10 knew paper applications would be ' stuck in the same queue			1
' according to notes from inside an @entity10 ' war room ' set up to troubleshoot the website in its calamitous first days , stakeholders were told on october 11 that ' [ t ] he paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provides another option ; at the end of the day , we are all stuck in the same queue			1
' the notes were released monday by the @entity25 , which obtained them from the @entity27 , a website contractor , not from the @entity2 administration			2
the @entity10 war room ' learned two weeks ago that paper @entity31 applications were ' stuck in the same queue ' with attempts to visit @entity34 the main @entity31 website highlights four methods for applying for health insurance under the @entity31 , but they all rely on the dysfunctional website to determine who 's eligible for government subsidies the committee has subpoenaed @entity10 for documents like these , since it has so far ignored more polite requests			1
contractors for the @entity46 have to manually enter data from paper applications into the same website that consumers use â€“ the hapless and error - prone site that has been down nearly as much as it 's been up since its october 1 launch			2
@entity1 signing up for @entity31 coverage on the telephone , or with the help of ' navigators ' tasked with providing community - level assistance , face the same problem : both methods rely on healthcare.gov			0
and when the site is offline , no one 's application gets through			0
' the same portal is used to determine eligibility [ for government subsidies ] no matter how the application is submitted ( paper , online ) , ' reads another section of the war room notes			1
on the same day the @entity10 war room was advised to tell navigator groups to stop using the @entity31 website and use paper applications , the president emphasized the hand - written approach in a @entity80 speech on oct.15 the war room heard that ' [ n ] avigators are seeing people very frustrated and walking away , so they are turning to paper applications to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help , even though paper applications will not have a quicker result necessarily			1
' by october 21 , the navigators were reporting enough problems accessing the website that healthcare.gov team leaders were given marching orders to tell them to stop using it			0
' [ @entity99 ] e are to instruct @entity100 to use paper applications rather than go through the call center , ' that day 's notes read			0
on that shat same day , president @entity2 said during a @entity80 speech about the problems with @entity34 told @entity1 they could use paper applications			0
@entity1 representative @entity106 , a @entity108 @entity107 , chairs the @entity25 , and has been the most active investigator digging into @entity31 's failures ' we updated the website 's home page to offer more information about the other avenues to enroll in affordable health care until the online option works for everybody , ' the president said			2
' so you 'll find information about how to talk to a specialist who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable application you can fill out yourself and mail in			0
' excerpts from the same war room meetings held earlier in october showed that @entity10 only enrolled six people in new @entity31 insurance plans on the first day healthcare.gov was open , and fewer than 250 on the second day			1
but by october 21 , one of the contractors tasked with hand - entering information from paper applications reported that it had received 3,000 such requests for health insurance coverage			2
the @entity2 administration needs to recruit 7 million new applicants by the end of march , or about 38,500 per day .			0

at a ' war room ' meeting on oct. 21 , website contractors learned that paper applications would be entered into the problematic website
there are four ways to apply for @entity31 insurance , but they all rely on the disastrous website
using healthcare.gov is the only means to find out if an applicant is eligible for government subsidies for their *medical* insurance
the documents were released by the @entity25 , which had to go to a contractor to obtain the documents since @entity10 is *n't* talking
