by @entity0 last updated at 9:25 am on 14th february 2012 after five years of watching vehicles speed through his village at up to 98mph , @entity1 decided something had to be done			1
exasperated at the council ’s failure to lower the speed limit or install a speed camera , he built a dummy camera on his land – and within a fortnight traffic speeds dropped			1
but the same council has now told the father of four he could be blamed if drivers crash while trying to slow down to avoid being ‘ flashed ’ by the fake device			0
convincing : after the council refused a request to install a real speed camera in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity1 spent £ 250 making his own it has warned him he could be sued if anyone claimed they were ‘ distracted or influenced by the “ camera ”			1
’ mr @entity1 , 50 , said : ‘ i ’ve been told if someone causes an accident by obeying the legal speed limit through the village , then it ’s my fault			1
’ the interior designer , who had a welder friend make the £ 250 device out of scrap metal , said : ‘ it ’s just the job			1
’ villagers in @entity18 , @entity19 , have been campaigning for a 30mph speed limit ever since it was first cut from 60mph to 40mph six years ago			1
@entity37 has refused on the grounds that the village – a scattering of around 20 properties along the main @entity42 to @entity44 road – does not meet its criteria for the lower limit			1
reprimanded : now the district council has told mr @entity1 that he will be responsible for any accidents caused by the fake camera two temporary ‘ interactive ’ speed signs have been placed there since the limit was originally lowered			1
mr @entity1 said villagers had in the past been on a police speed watch course , where they were taught how to use a speed gun			2
‘ once we caught somebody coming through the village at 98mph and we regularly have cars and bikes coming through at 60 to 70mph			0
‘ you can tell when somebody ’s sticking to the limit because they look so slow			0
fear : mr @entity1 claims that getting out of his drive is like ' taking your life in your hands ' while his wife @entity71 almost crashed into a lorry going 60mph not working : the speed limit through @entity18 was cut from 60mph to 40mph six years ago , but attempts to get that lowered to 30 have failed ‘ the speed of the traffic makes it extremely difficult to get out of my house and on to the main roads in the morning – most think nothing of doing 60 or 70mph			1
’ matters came to a head recently when wife @entity71 , 52 , who helps run their design business , was almost hit by a speeding hgv as she turned out of their track			0
mr @entity1 added : ‘ we have a problem with speeding through this village and it ’s not going to be long before it kills someone			2
’ the council sent an official to see the ‘ camera ’ , who asked him to remove it			0
but because the replica is on his own land , the authority is powerless to force him			0
mr @entity1 said the letter from @entity37 then arrived			2
in it , the district highways manager wrote : ‘ i fully appreciate your reluctance to remove the “ camera ”			0
however i must reiterate that if an accident occurred and anyone claimed they were distracted or influenced by the “ camera ” i believe you would be liable for civil action			0
’ councillor @entity112 , the county council ’s cabinet member for transport and highways , said : ‘ we agree that the camera is having an effect on reducing speed			2
‘ however , we do have concerns that , without the correct warning signs , it is a potential hazard as it is causing motorists to brake suddenly			0
’ he said speed cameras had to be properly positioned with correct warning signs , and added : ‘ we fully understand the concerns of residents in @entity18 ... and we are hoping to put in a permanent interactive speed sign in the near future			0

@entity1 built £ 250 camera after driver did 98mph in 40 zone
