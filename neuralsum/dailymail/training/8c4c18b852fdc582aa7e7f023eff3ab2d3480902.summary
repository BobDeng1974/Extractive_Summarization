by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 08:44 est , 17 april 2012 officials seized three pairs of shoes left outside a practising @entity5 ’s council flat because they posed a fire hazard			1
@entity7 thought his two pairs of trainers and work shoes had been stolen when he opened his front door to find them gone from the communal hallway			1
but the 35 - year - old , who keeps his shoes outside for religious reasons , was stunned after a neighbour told him a council housing officer had removed them			1
@entity7 ( pictured ) thought his two pairs of trainers and work shoes had been stolen when he opened his front door to find them gone from the communal hallway he was even more shocked after he called the local authority and was told the footwear could have presented an obstacle to people in the event of a fire			1
they then charged him a £ 25 fee to get his property back			1
hygiene is very important to practising @entity33 who generally take their shoes off when entering mosques and homes to keep the areas clean and as a mark of respect			2
mr @entity7 , a security guard at his local magistrates ’ court , had to go to work wearing flip - flops and was given a ticking off by his boss			1
he believes his shoes - which included a pair of @entity47 and @entity48 trainers - were taken by the officious council worker minutes before he was due to leave for work			1
mr @entity7 , who is @entity51 but now lives in @entity52 , @entity53 , said : ' i was ready to go to work and dressed in my uniform and went to put my shoes on and realised they had gone			1
' i thought they had been stolen but then somebody told me a council officer had taken them			1
' i was due to leave for work at 10.30am so the officer must have taken them up to 90 minutes beforehand			2
' why they could n’t have just knocked on my door to tell me there was a problem i do n’t know			0
' i had to go to work wearing my black flip - flops and was told off by my manager for not wearing proper shoes			1
' i called the council later and was told that you ca n’t have any items in the communal area in case of a fire			2
' they did n’t think that by taking my shoes that might stop me leaving my flat if there was a fire			2
' i told them that there was a doormat outside my flat and the guy from the council told me that i needed that , but i did n’t need my shoes ? i does n’t make sense			2
' the council told me they did n’t have to give me any warning and that it was part of my tenancy agreement not to have any objects blocking the hallway			2
' by that i thought they meant an old fridge or bicycle			0
' it was just completely unnecessary			0
' he said : ' for religious reasons we can not take shoes inside the house			0
' people are sick outside or spit on the floor and there is also dog mess			0
we leave shoes because we pray inside			0
' he said a council officer inspected the communal areas of the block of flats two weeks ago and nothing was mentioned then , although a neighbour had to remove a pot plant			0
a spokesman for @entity122 said the tenancy agreement forbids tenants from storing personal items in communal areas			0
he added : ' we appreciate that it is customary in the @entity33 faith to have a space allocated for footwear in the property before entering the private area			0
' in this case it is understood to be the entrance hallway of the flat itself			0
' the flat effectively ends at the communal hallway which , for fire evacuation purposes , must be kept completely clear			0

@entity7 was charged £ 25 to get his shoes back after the council said they were a fire hazard
he thought his shoes had been stolen and had to go to work in his flip - flops
