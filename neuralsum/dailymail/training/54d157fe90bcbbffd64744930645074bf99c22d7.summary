@entity0 : 13:10 est , 1 december 2011 predictions that rising sea levels will swallow up low lying islands are a ' false alarm ' , an expert has claimed			1
apocalyptic warnings that islands such as the @entity8 will sink beneath the waves are far - fetched , said @entity10 , former head of the @entity11 and @entity13 department at @entity14			0
he says that any rise in sea levels is to do with natural historic fluctuations			1
opening this year 's @entity17 , president of the @entity8 , warned this his country was ' an island nation that may slip beneath the waves if all this talk on climate does not lead to action soon '			2
while , in his briefing to the convention , @entity24 , head of the @entity25 , outlined the dangers science anticipates unless carbon emissions are curbed			0
@entity17 , president of the @entity8 ( pictured ) said that he leads , ' an island nation that may slip beneath the waves if all this talk on climate does not lead to action soon			2
' he said that coastal areas and islands are threatened with inundation by global warming			0
but in a provocative article in the spectator , @entity10 says : ' i have conducted six field trips to the @entity8			0
i can report that while such regions do have problems , they need not fear rising sea levels			1
' @entity10 said that cycles from the 18th and 17th century proved that current rises were not related to global @entity50 said that the @entity25 's views on sea - level rises were invalid			1
. ' @entity54 rises are affected by a great many factors , such as the speed at which the earth rotates			2
they rose in the order of 10cm to 11cm between 1850 and 1940			0
' ' it is clear that sea levels rise and fall entirely independently of so - called ' climate change ' , ' he said			1
@entity64 claims that data from satellites has been ' tilted ' to distort figures - and that a member of the @entity25 admitted to him , ' we had to do so otherwise there would be no new trend			1
' @entity72 , 13 , speaks at the @entity74 talks in @entity75 @entity24 's claims also included that within a decade , up to 250million more people will face the stress of scarce water			1
increasingly frequent weather disasters have imposed heavy financial burdens , with some poor countries running up 90 perc ent of their national debt to deal with the aftermath of storms , droughts and floods , he said			0
' developed countries as a whole are not taking climate change seriously as a global issue , ' @entity89 , of @entity90 , said			2
' look at the @entity95 we use and we welcome their leadership on democracy , on access to markets , on human rights issues			0
we would want to have the same leadership to tackle climate change , because for us in the developing world the biggest threat , the biggest enemy , is climate change.â €			0

satellite data ' tilted to distort figures '
historical data *suggests* sea rises and fall naturally
@entity74 ' expert ' admits ' we had to *adjust* data , otherwise there would be no new trend '
climate expert describes sea levels as ' artificial *crisis* '
