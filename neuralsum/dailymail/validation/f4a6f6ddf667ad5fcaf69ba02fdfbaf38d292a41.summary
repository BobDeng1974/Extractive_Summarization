scientists have developed a necklace dubbed the ‘ diet choker ’ that monitors everything that goes down your throat - and sends you an alert if you overeat			1
@entity7 is a metal ring that goes around your neck and has a sensor which uses the vibrations in your throat to tell when you are eating and drinking			1
the researchers behind the device have linked it up to a smartphone app which buzzes if you go over your daily calorie limit			1
scientists have combined @entity7 , a metal ring that goes around the neck ( above ) to monitor eating , with a smartphone app which counts calories it also lets you know if you eat too much of the wrong kind of food			1
the device was developed by engineers at the @entity33 , @entity34 and so far the tests on 30 people show that the it does work			1
but the reaction elsewhere has been mixed reaction and some tech websites likened it to a choke collar , though it does not contract if you eat too much			2
another website , @entity45 , dubbed it the ‘ weirdest ( tech ) wearable we have seen to date ’			2
the @entity33 team said the @entity7 works because each food makes a distinctive pattern of vibrations in the neck so the device is able to work out what it is you are consuming using a piezoelectric sensor , which measures changes in pressure or force			1
in tests with a limited menu it has guessed with 90 per cent accuracy the difference between solid and liquid foods - and even the difference between hot or cold drinks			2
it could also distinguish between hard and soft foods about 75 per cent of the time , the findings in the journal @entity71 said			0
@entity7 co-founder @entity74 said : ‘ many nutrition methods are based on writing down what you eat			1
‘ but this method has low compliance so we wanted to overcome these issues and wanted to do something that a pedometer does for activity ’			0
scientists are hopeful the technology will also tell users when they are eating the wrong types of food ( file image ) in a demonstration posted on @entity93 , the device asks for the user ’s age , height , weight and their goal such as to lose weight or stay the same			1
it will then tell them what they have eaten , how fast they eat their food and gives them advice such as if you miss a meal it mentions how it could leave you fatigued			0
the @entity33 researchers said that other applications they could see for the device included tracking when somebody takes a pill to ensure they take their daily medicine			0
it could also remotely monitor breathing patterns of transplant patients as abnormal breathing may be an early indicator that the organ is being rejected			0
even smokers who are trying to quit could benefit from the device as it could potentially tell when they are puffing away from the movement in their neck			0
the @entity7 is the latest example of the growing industry of wearable tech and comes on the day that @entity131 is due to release details of its long - awaited smart watch			1
major tech companies are banking on consumers taking to the wave of wristbands , watches and eyewear that augments the functions of their smartphone			2
last year @entity144 launched its range of @entity146 which includes a watch which allows you to check your email or send a text , meaning you do n’t have to reach into your pocket for your phone			0
the latest update to @entity131 ’s operating system for its @entity156 includes a ‘ health ’ app which monitors how many steps a person takes each day like a pedometer			2
not all wearable tech has been a success however and @entity144 ’s controversial eyewear , @entity164 , was axed in the @entity165 after less than a year of limited release			0
@entity144 closed it @entity169 programme , which gave select people the chance to buy @entity164 for £ 990 , after a privacy backlash and because consumers did not take to the futuristic design			0
@entity164 , which @entity131 priced at £ 990 , was axed in the @entity165 after less than a year of limited release			0
