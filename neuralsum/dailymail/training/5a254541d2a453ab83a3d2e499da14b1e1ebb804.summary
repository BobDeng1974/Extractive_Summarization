monarch butterflies are famous for migrating from the @entity1 and @entity2 to @entity3 for the winter			1
however , researchers have been baffled by how the tiny insects can manage such a feat. now , a new dna analysis say specially adapted muscles are the key			1
the 3,000 - mile ( 4,800 - km ) mass migration of monarch butterflies in @entity19 is one of the insect world 's fantastic feats			1
millions embarking on the arduous journey from as far north as @entity2 down into @entity3 and the @entity27 coast each autumn			2
the number of migrating monarchs has plummeted in recent years			1
researchers said while an estimated one billion monarch butterflies migrated to @entity3 in 1996 , that number stood at about 35 million this past winter			0
threats to them include habitat loss due to human activities , pesticides that kill milkweed and climate change , experts say			0
monarch butterflies living east of the @entity41 spend their winters in @entity3 to escape the cold weather while those west of the @entity41 spend winters on the @entity27 coast before returning home in the spring			0
scientists say their orange color tells potential predators they taste awful and are toxic to eat thanks to chemicals from the milkweed plants that nourish them in their larval state			0
the study also suggests the species itself also started out in @entity19 some 2 million years ago			1
dna from 80 monarchs sampled from the @entity61 and as far away as @entity62 and @entity63 points to a @entity19 origin , maybe in the @entity65 or northern @entity3			1
researcher @entity66 of the @entity67 said monarchs were widely thought to have evolved in @entity65 or @entity69 instead			2
but @entity66 also said scientists had thought the monarch arose from a non-migrating ancestor			0
but the new study concludes the ancestor did migrate			2
researchers pinpointed a single gene related to flight muscle efficiency that plays a major role in the monarch butterfly 's migration			1
their study , published in the journal nature , also identified the gene behind the butterfly 's striking orange - and - black coloration			1
' i find it amazing that these little butterflies live for months and fly thousands of miles to perform this annual migration , ' said one the researchers , @entity67 professor of ecology and evolution @entity66			1
' our study shows that monarchs have been doing this every year for millions of years			1
there is nothing else like this on the planet , ' @entity66 added			0
the number of migrating monarchs has plummeted in recent years			2
@entity66 said while an estimated one billion monarch butterflies migrated to @entity3 in 1996 , that number stood at about 35 million this past winter			0
migrating @entity13 on a @entity106 : a gene related to collagen , the main ingredient in connective tissue , is essential for flight muscle function			2
threats to them include habitat loss due to human activities , pesticides that kill milkweed and climate change , experts say			0
while mainly a @entity19 species , monarch populations also can be found in @entity69 , @entity121 and elsewhere			1
those outside @entity19 do not migrate			1
the researchers carried out genome sequences on 92 monarch butterflies from around the world including non-migratory ones as well as on nine butterflies from closely related species			2
to study the genetic basis for migration , they compared the genetic blueprint of migratory monarchs to those that do not migrate			1
' one gene really stood out from everything else in the genome , ' @entity66 said			0
it was a gene related to collagen , the main ingredient in connective tissue , that was essential for flight muscle function			2
the researchers were surprised to find the gene was less active , not more active , in migratory butterflies			0
so rather than making them big , powerful fliers the gene favored enhanced flight efficiency			2
' an analogy might be the difference between marathon runners ( migrating butterflies ) and sprinters , ' @entity66 said			0
@entity155 , a biologist at the @entity156 , said the study determined that the species originated in @entity19 , contradicting the hypothesis that monarchs evolved from tropical ancestors			1
adult monarch butterflies boast wings that are orange with black veins and white spots along the outside edges			0
their wingspan is about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) and their bodies are black			0
scientists say their orange color tells potential predators they taste awful and are toxic to eat thanks to chemicals from the milkweed plants that nourish them in their larval state			0
@entity66 said monarch butterflies living east of the @entity41 spend their winters in @entity3 to escape the cold weather while those west of the @entity41 spend winters on the @entity27 coast before returning home in the spring .			0

dna from 80 monarchs points to a @entity19 origin for the species
insects famous for their 3,000 - mile ( 4,800 - km ) mass migration
study also *revealed* the muscle efficiency that allows the butterfly to fly so far
