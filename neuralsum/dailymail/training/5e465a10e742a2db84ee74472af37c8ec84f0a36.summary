when @entity10 's parents reported the bite marks on their disabled daughter to her special needs school in @entity14 , the school tried to blame the attack on @entity10 's sister			1
her parents have rejected claims that the attack happened in their own home , questioning how @entity21 's attack went unnoticed in the special needs classroom of @entity23			2
victim : cerebral palsy sufferer @entity10 is covered in bite marks but she can not name her attacker brutal attack : human bite marks can be clearly seen on the disabled teenager 's back and shoulder ' they gon na try and pass the buck , say it happened here			1
no way , impossible , ' her father , @entity36 , said			0
@entity10 's family believe the attack happened in school on may 1 , telling @entity42 they first noticed the marks two days later			1
the teenager , who has been confined to a wheelchair for most of her life and is unable to communicate clearly , had four human bite marks and other marks along her shoulder and back			0
' it 's brutal ! it is brutal , ' mr @entity36 said			2
' there 's no way possible that no one 's seen the incident occur			0
' he claims that after reporting the attack to her school , a male teacher told them that one of @entity10 's classmates was responsible			1
mr @entity36 added that the teacher suggested one of the other pupils who has special needs had been attacking other students			0
silenced : @entity36 with his daughter @entity10 , who is unable to communicate and name her attacker the school rejects this claim however , saying that when the teachers were interviewed they denied seeing the attack			2
@entity76 , a spokesman for the school district , said : ' it could not have happened at school , and if it could have -- if for some reason something happened -- someone would have seen it			0
' @entity10 , whose suffers from a neurological disorder that affects muscle movements , shares a special needs classroom with six other children and seven adult supervisors			0
while many toddlers go through a phase of biting , it is also often seen in older children who have development problems or disabilities			0
the school reported the injuries to @entity14 's @entity99 , which is investigating the case as possible child abuse			1
blame game : @entity10 's parents say the attack happened at @entity23 , but teachers deny this mr @entity36 said the department interviewed him and his wife about the possibility that @entity10 's 17 - year - old sister had bitten her			1
cerebral palsy is one of the most common disabilities affecting muscle movement in the @entity116 @entity115 estimates that one in every 303 @entity116 eight - year - olds are affected by it			1
after research in 2006 , the center concluded that families and sufferers were in need of improved health , education and intervention services			0
cerebral palsy sufferers can be affected to differing degrees			1
while some , like @entity21 , are confined to wheelchairs and lack the ability to speak clearly , others may be only slightly affected and will need little assistance over their lives			0
and while there is no cure , researchers say that with early intervention for physical and occupational therapy , many sufferers are able to lead regular lives			0
but in @entity10 's case , with no clear way to tell her parents or teachers who caused her wounds , her attacker remains unnamed			2
investigators from the @entity99 are due to return to the family 's home next week to check on the welfare of the @entity36 children .			2
