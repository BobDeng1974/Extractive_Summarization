by @entity0 @entity1 was on the brink of death when a group of nine strangers at her gym staged an intervention for the 23 - year - old anorexic graduate student three years ago			1
five - foot - four @entity1 weighed just 79 pounds the morning the group stopped her in the parking lot of the @entity11 in @entity12 and took her to @entity13 for help			1
in a phone interview with @entity16 , @entity1 confessed that she struggled with the eating disorder for more than a decade , and had been hospitalized a dozen or more times			1
but it was that much needed ' wake - up call ' by the group of mere acquaintances that led her to finally get healthy			1
graduate student @entity1 was saved from near - certain death after a group of strangers at her @entity11 staged an intervention when they noticed how dangerously thin she was getting			1
above , @entity1 ( in blue ) reunited with some of her ' @entity29 ' @entity30 and his wife @entity31 were two of the @entity11 members involved in the intervention , and had noticed the girl working out religiously - sometimes multiple times a day - at the gym for quite sometime			1
before they learned her name , they called her ' that girl ' in conversations until they finally got the courage to say something			0
suffering : @entity1 hit rock bottom in august 2011 , when she stepped on the scale and saw that she was just 79 pounds mrs @entity45 was the first to make the move			1
on a monday morning , she approached @entity47 as she was walking from the upstairs workout area to a downstairs weight machine			0
' i know we do n't know each other , ' mrs @entity45 recalled to the @entity53			0
' i have to tell you that i would like to get you some help			0
i believe that you have an eating disorder , and i really want to do something to help you			0
' @entity1 rebuffed mrs @entity45 's concerns , saying she was ok and had received counseling			2
little did she know that @entity1 had with @entity60 since elementary school when a popular girl asked her how much she weighed at the age of 10			1
by the time @entity1 was in the seventh - grade she had to be admitted to a inpatient program , and had to seek treatment again when she was a freshman at the @entity67			1
she hit her rock bottom weight in august 2011 after moving to @entity69 to attend graduate school at @entity71 and the members at her gym decided to voice their concerns			1
' it was just a struggle to even work out 30 minutes less or to make myself eat a teaspoon of almond butter more , ' @entity1 said			2
the day after mrs @entity45 's initial conversation with @entity1 , the members started getting more serious about their intervention			1
they found out @entity1 's first name from someone at the front desk , and another member was already a friend of @entity1 's on @entity86			2
stopped : after unsuccessfully offering help , a group of nine staged an intervention in the parking lot of the @entity11 , before @entity1 could go in for her morning @entity91 then proceeded to take her to the hospital for emergency treatment in a good place : @entity1 , pictured with her father above , went into treatment for 11 months after the intervention and is now at a healthy weight - though she does n't step on the scale anymore or count calories from there they were able to track down @entity1 's father on the social networking site , and the very next day mrs @entity45 and gym - member @entity104 called up @entity47 to voice their concerns			1
friends forever : though she does n't live in @entity12 anymore , @entity1 reunited with her ' angels ' ever time she 's in town and they are planning a party to celebrate her graduation in may on wednesday morning , the @entity112 and @entity104 banded together with @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 to arrive at the gym early before @entity1 started her workout			2
the group persuaded @entity1 to go with them to @entity13 and she nearly talked her way out of being admitted			2
however , her @entity124 called ahead warning the hospital staff that his daughter would not cooperate			0
' we could n't help her , ' said @entity47 said			0
' we were so close to it for so long			0
we had just been to @entity12 three weeks before the intervention			0
we came to @entity12 the last week of july and really got in the car and cried on the way home			0
we did n't know if she was going to make it			0
' had the strangers decided to not say anything to @entity1 , she probably would n't be alive today			2
@entity1 spent three days in intensive care and three and a half weeks in a cardiac unit because her heart beat had slowed down to such dangerous levels doctors were considering surgery to install a pacemaker			0
but @entity1 recovered , though she spent nearly a year in treatment working towards a healthy weight			1
she spent most of the 11 months at a treatment center in @entity147 , aided by the long - distance support of her cheerleaders back at the @entity11			0
@entity1 says she received constant letters , emails and @entity86 messages from the group which really helped her stick with treatment			1
three years later , @entity1 says she no longer pays attention to her weight and does n't count calories			0
and though she no longer lives in @entity12 , she remains close to the nine ' angels ' who stepped up to save her life			0
. the group reunited nearly every time she is in town , and they are planning a party to celebrate @entity1 's graduation from @entity71 in may			2
' i consider them some of my greatest friends in @entity12 ... i think our hearts kind of bonded through that experience , ' @entity1 told @entity16			0
