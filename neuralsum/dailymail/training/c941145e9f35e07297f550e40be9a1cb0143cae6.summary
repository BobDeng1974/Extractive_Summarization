the final recording took place in a crowded restaurant in @entity24 's picturesque @entity60 in hopes of getting him to confirm her suspicions about the death of his son			2
‘ i led him to believe our marriage had a chance if he came clean , ’ @entity1 said in a recent hearing , the husband she is now in the process of divorcing sitting in prison orange just a few feet away			2
‘ i told him he could trust me			0
’ the wire picked up @entity20 telling @entity1 how he 'd removed his truck 's front tires and raised it on a single jack before asking @entity32 to repair the brake and transmission lines			1
‘ it was so wobbly , ’ @entity1 said , according to a recording of the conversation , heard against the backdrop of restaurant noise , played recently in court			2
tell the truth , @entity1 implored			2
‘ it was never meant to be , ’ he said			0
‘ it was never planned from @entity93 to ever go that way			0

district attorney @entity126 calls them crucial to the case			0
in an interview with @entity130 of @entity131 a month after his arrest , @entity1 said his ex-wife 's death , his son 's death and even a 2002 fire at his @entity22 farm that killed his @entity141 draft horses , for which he collected $ 80,000 ( £ 50,000 ) in insurance money , were all just coincidences			1
but @entity144 , @entity38 's father , told @entity145 from his @entity146 , @entity34 , home that he did n't think bad luck had anything to do with it			0
‘ i think it 's a very greedy man with a very cold heart , ’ said @entity144 , who has long suspected that his son - in - law and former business partner was responsible for his 30 - year - old daughter 's death			0
