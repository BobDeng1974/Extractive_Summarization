sitting on long wooden benches in a dimly - lit hall , rows of men - scruffy and unwashed - look grimly at the camera as they ready for another night in the shelter			1
every one of them has paid one penny - roughly 32p today - for a space on the bench or on the floor			2
their night will be spent sitting up , or leaning against a cold , dank wall			2
this shelter in @entity14 , @entity15 , was set up by the @entity16 in the early 1890s - one of a number of places that provided temporary housing to thousands who were poor or homeless			1
the bleak scene is just one of the images included in an upcoming museum exhibition that seeks to explore the places inhabited by @entity15 's most deprived at the turn of the last century			1
while today the term can describe @entity51 who live comfortably , 110 years ago it covered the men , women and children who only had a few pennies to their name - if any			2
but despite their poverty , their experiences were not always the desperate tales immortalised in dickensian novels , explained @entity62 , a curator at @entity48			2
your fate depended on who you were , where you stayed - and how much you could scrape together			2
beginning in the 1840s , the exhibition charts how , as the century wore on , the problems of accommodating @entity15 ’s poor became more acute			1
slum clearance and the demolition of housing to make way for the railways pushed the poor into ever decreasing areas			2
rents soared and living conditions plummeted			2
the exhibition starts with the street , looking at where the homeless slept rough in the city			2
this , said @entity62 , drew some interesting comparisons to the present - day , with many of the same ' hotspots ' for homelessness remaining today			1
it then looks at where the destitute , or those who were able to make only a precarious living might seek shelter			2
' @entity98 beds ' : these cramped bunks were n't particularly comfortable , but they did offer visitors a dry and clean place to sleep while popular accounts of the shelters and workhouses , often by middle - class observers , make them seem bleak and uninhabitable , they are often seen in a more favourable light by their lower - class visitors			1
one of the sketches in the collection , for example , illustrates a group of men settling in for a night in so - called ' coffin boxes ' - wooden bunks that were barely long enough to fit a body			2
this scene shows life inside @entity119 , in the former @entity15 borough of @entity121			1
the establishment opened in 1893 and , by the early 1900s , attracted hundreds of men hoping to secure a stay in one of the 450 bunks			0
while the cramped and uncomfortable conditions might provoke shock in middle - class @entity131 and modern - day viewers , the ' coffin beds ' - clean , dry and sheltered from the elements - were a welcome sight for most homeless @entity131			1
and a meal in one of these shelters - captured in another depressing image that shows men sat side - by - side at long tables - meant food and a roof over their heads			1
sleeping rough : this painting , titled ' @entity146 on a @entity147 ' , by @entity148 shows a poor @entity15 boy on the streets a night at one of these shelters , which were often run by charitable or philanthropic organisations , would cost one penny			1
visitors also had the option of completing a work task to earn their keep			0
but shelters were n't meant as long - term solutions , said @entity62 , so those who ran them had to keep them from feeling too inviting			1
she said : ' they did n't want to be seen to be encouraging homelessness so they implemented things like mandatory washing with shared bathwater when you entered			0
' those who had slightly more money - perhaps earned from intermittent work - could pay threepence for a room in a common lodging			2
these simply - furnished rooms , situated in houses owned by private landlords , would include not much more than a simple bedframe , but they did offer more privacy than a shelter or workhouse			0
for sixpence , one could afford a bed in a model lodging house - with private rooms and slightly more luxury			0
the dirty and cramped conditions in these lodging houses excited both sympathy and disapproval from contemporary observers			0
scraping a living : @entity198 's painting , the pinch of @entity196 , shows a young girl selling bunches of flowers on the street later in the century more efforts were made to provide housing for the poor , for families and for single men living by themselves , as well as specialist accommodation for children			1
experiences also varied greatly on whether you were a man , woman or child , explained @entity62			1
records of meals and sleeping arrangements reveal that slightly more care was given to the most vulnerable - ' invalids ' , women and children - while fit , working - aged men often had the worst deals			0
while our way of measuring - and handling - poverty and homelessness might have changed since the @entity15 era , the issue remains a contemporary one			1
that is why a parallel exhibition will run along side @entity232 , one that engages with contemporary homelessness in @entity15			1
homes of the @entity46 : seeking shelter in @entity15 opens at the @entity48 , @entity15 24 march - 12 july now the main measure used by the government to define poverty in the @entity51 today is whether or not the household income is below 60 per cent of the median income			1
this is calculated before @entity242 ( @entity243 ) such as council tax and rent are taken into consideration			0
the @entity51 's average salary , as of january 2014 , is £ 26,500			0
the latest figures on poverty from 2012/2013 , released by the @entity250 in july this year , shows the average household income before @entity242 is £ 440 per week			0
based on that figure , the report found 15 per cent ( 9.7m ) of @entity51 are living in poverty			0
there have also been other types of poverty introduced which are recognised by the government			0
these include fuel poverty and material deprivation , the latter of which refers to the ' self - reported inability of individuals or households to afford particular goods and activities that are typical in society at a given point in time '			0
the government also recognises ' persistent poverty ' , seen as those living in households where income is less than 60 per cent of median household , for at least three out of the last four years			0
in 2011 , each person 's disposable income in the @entity51 was around £ 14,000			0
the 60 per cent measure is criticised because it is relative to the current economic state of the country - meaning there could effectively be ' less people ' living in poverty during a recession			1
then during the 1800s , a great proportion of @entity288 lived in terrible poverty			0
@entity15 cities were overcrowded , filthy and bleak			1
but it was often not known exactly how many were ' poor ' - and how they should be classed			1
@entity294 , a successful businessman , thought social reformers had exaggerated @entity15 's poverty levels , which were said to be about a quarter			1
in 1886 , he decided to find out the truth			0
as part of his research @entity294 lived with working - class families for several weeks at a time			1
it revealed the level of want was even worse than generally thought : as many as one third of @entity288 lived in poverty			0
he took into account a wide variety of subjects including working conditions , education , wage levels , workhouses , religion , and police			0
@entity294 's work was instrumental in establishing the old age pension , an idea which had been around since @entity319 's @entity318 in 1791			0
the first pensions were paid on 1 jan 1909 ( 2 january in @entity321 )			0
the census also provided some information on the country 's most deprived			0

upcoming museum exhibition explores the varied experiences of those living on the streets in @entity15
photographs , paintings and first - hand accounts bring dank shelters and *over-crowded* workhouses to life
look into lives of those who sometimes struggled lived day - to - day shows viewers what it really meant to be poor
