by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 kidnapper @entity2 committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell , two corrections consultants concluded following a review of his death released on tuesday			1
the conclusion rejected earlier suggestions that he may have died accidentally while seeking a sexual thrill			0
@entity2 's september 3 death was likely not the result of auto - erotic asphyxiation , an act in which individuals seek a thrill by choking themselves into unconsciousness , according to the report by the nationally regarded consultants			1
@entity2 breaks down during his trial for the abduction of three girls he kept locked in his @entity3 home for a decade			1
@entity2 , 53 , later committed suicide in his prison cell a review by the state prisons agency earlier this fall suggested that possibility			1
the report said all available evidence pointed to suicide , including a shrine - like arrangement of family pictures and a @entity35 in @entity2 's cell , an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment			1
subsequent reviews by the @entity46 and the @entity48 coroner reached the same conclusion , the report said			0
' in conclusion , based upon the fact that this inmate was going to remain in prison for the rest of his natural life under the probability of continued perceived harassment and threats to his safety , his death was not predictable on september 3 , 2013 , but his suicide was not surprising and perhaps inevitable , ' the report said			2
the consultants said it was likely @entity2 was harassed by guards , based on interviews with inmates who said they had heard such harassment			2
@entity2 was serving a life sentence plus 1,000 years when he committed suicide none of the multiple health assessments that @entity2 received indicated anything that would have required suicide - prevention measures , the consultants said			1
the @entity76 is committed to following recommendations in the report , spokeswoman @entity75 said in a statement			0
those recommendations include beefing up staff training on suicide prevention and ending the use of online training			0
@entity2 , 53 , was found kneeling in his cell with his pants down and hanging from a sheet attached to a window hinge , according to an earlier prison report			1
he had just begun serving a sentence of life plus 1,000 years			1
he pleaded guilty in august to imprisoning three women in his @entity3 home for a decade while repeatedly raping and assaulting them			2
he fathered a girl with one of the victims			0
some inmates - who had not seen @entity2 - suggested his pants slipped because of his 10 - pound weight loss since entering prison , the report said			1
but one nurse interviewed by the consultants said @entity2 was completely naked , while a supervisor said it was not uncommon for @entity2 to be naked in his cell , according to the report			2
two prison guards were placed on paid administrative leave during the state 's investigation into @entity2 's death			1
the @entity76 alleged the two falsified logs documenting the number of times guards checked on @entity2 before he died			0
house of horrors : the house in @entity3 , @entity116 where @entity2 held @entity2 , @entity2 , @entity2 and the daughter he fathered with her captive for years the consultants ' report criticized the falsification but said it did n't contribute to @entity2 's death since he was seen alive minutes before he hanged himself in a check that met prison standards			1
the union representing prison guards says the state is scapegoating front - line employees for supervisory failures			0
@entity2 abducted the women from the streets of @entity3 from 2002 to 2004 when they were 14 , 16 and 20			2
he periodically kept them chained in rooms , sometimes in the basement , and restricted access to food and toilets			0
