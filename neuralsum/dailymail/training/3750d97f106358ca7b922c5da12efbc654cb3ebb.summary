plus - size trendsetter @entity0 has finally launched a second collection for swimsuits for all today , filled with retro - style bikinis , tankinis , and maillot styles that come in brightly - colored prints			1
the designs follow the 26 - year - old writer ’s inaugural design outing for the online retailer , which left fans disappointed when the collection sold out in less than 48 hours last may			1
much like her first swimsuit range , miss @entity0 ’s new designs are offered in sizes 10 through 24 and hark back to the @entity17 with high - waist ruched bottoms and full - coverage underwire tops			2
they are presently available for pre-sale and will ship after april 16			0
styling : following the success of ms @entity0 's blog , @entity26 , she has designed a range of sellout swimwear for plus - size women ( pictured in one of her designs ) miss @entity0 ’s second batch of designs for swimsuits for all range in price from $ 43.50 for a bikini , to $ 58.50 for a ruffled tankini			1
these prices reflect the 25per cent promotional discount that @entity34 is currently offering site - wide			0
miss @entity0 , a size 18 herself , has named the collection after her blogging alter - ego @entity26			2
she rose to acclaim last year after posting a call to action on her blog for plus - size readers to send photos of themselves wearing swimsuits			0
thirty - one women responded to the call , and were featured on miss @entity0 ’s site in a photo gallery which she titled ‘ @entity55 ’			0
shortly after , miss @entity0 signed a deal with @entity34 , telling fans of the collection on her site : ‘ i 'm super passionate about plus size women wearing great swimsuits unapologetically			1
retro designs : miss @entity0 's designs accentuate a woman 's curves with nostalgic , 1950s - inspired silhouettes many sized : miss @entity0 's collection comes in sizes 10 to 24 ‘ after all of the excitement surrounding last year 's @entity55 , i thought designing a few of my own would be a wonderful way to continue the movement			1
’ upon the collection ’s online release last may , she told refinery 29 of the designs : ‘ i think swimsuit shopping can be horrendous if you 're going to stores that do n't offer your size , but finding a stylish option that fits you well can actually make you feel great ! ’ miss @entity0 ’s outlook on swimwear resonated so strongly with fans that the collection sold out in just hours			1
bright patters : each of the suits come in bright patterns , and are priced between $ 43 and $ 58 hundreds of consumers who had placed orders for the designs were left disappointed when they received notice that their orders could not be filled			0
one , a shopper named @entity96 , commented on miss @entity0 ’s @entity98 account : ' i ordered mine 9am may 15th after waiting over a month for the release to get a call today that my order was cancelled because they ran out			0
' @entity34 is looking to avoid this disappointment with their current pre-sale of miss @entity0 ’s collection – which will help the site gauge how many suits should be produced .			2
