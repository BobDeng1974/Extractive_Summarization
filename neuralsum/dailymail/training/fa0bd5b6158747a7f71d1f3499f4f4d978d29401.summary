the working class are being squeezed out of high - end resort towns as @entity3 's rich - poor divide worsens , according to a new report			1
indeed , @entity5 , 49 , told the @entity6 that she was forced to move to a mobile home park 23 miles west of @entity8 after getting married because she could n't property in the luxury ski spot , dominated by millionaires			1
as a result of the grueling commute , she gave up her hotel job and took on lower - paying work closer to home			2
many low income workers are said to be facing similar situations			2
' it 's hard to live here , ' @entity19 said of residing in @entity8 , where the average property sale is now $ 5 million			1
@entity24 - poor divide : @entity5 , 49 , was forced to move to a mobile home park 23 miles west of @entity8 because she could n't afford property in the luxury ski spot dominated by billionaires the city dramatically demonstrates an unnerving trend : across the country , the rich are getting richer while the rest of the country is essentially treading water			1
from 2009 to 2012 , inflation - adjusted income for the wealthiest one per cent of @entity3 households surged 31per cent , according to economist @entity39 of the @entity40			1
for everyone else , income inched up just 0.4per cent			1
in @entity8 , the division is especially stark because it goes beyond mere money			1
the wealth gap is also a geographic divide			2
the people who clean the vacation homes , maintain the mansions ' gardens and work in the hotels must find housing in mobile home parks or subdivisions squeezed into the few acres of developable space dozens of miles to the west			0
a lucky few - about half of @entity8 's year - round population of 6,700 - are able to score units in the town 's unusual affordable housing program that , on the open market , would sell for millions of dollars			1
meanwhile , residents who struggle to find affordable real estate watch an increasing number of houses in town become rarely inhabited vacation properties			0
' it 's a mirror image of @entity71 , where wealth , not poverty , is driving population down , ' said @entity75 , a former three - term @entity8 mayor			1
@entity8 's dilemma is similar to that of other resort towns , from @entity79 , @entity80 , to @entity81 , @entity82 , especially those nestled in the jagged terrain of the western @entity3			1
in the @entity88 , vast tracts of public land and sheer mountain faces prevent the easy development of suburbs to house workers , pushing clusters of more affordable housing many miles away			0
the jobs in these communities are largely in the lower - paying service industry , yet the resort towns are a destination for the global upper class , said @entity100 , author of @entity101 in @entity102 , a book on resort towns			2
' in @entity106 , you can house your resort workers in the @entity108 or @entity109			0
but in @entity8 , they 're in @entity111 , ( about 70 ) miles down an icy mountain road , ' @entity100 said			2
' that 's the problem any resort community faces			0
it has no middle - income base to build on			2
' @entity8 's median family income of $ 71,000 is higher than the state average			1
but the further ' down - valley , ' or to the west , you drive , the more incomes drop until you hit @entity123 , 51 miles west , where the median family income of $ 54,000 is below average and carpenters , plumbers and other laborers regularly spend hours commuting to @entity8			1
the situation would be worse had @entity8 not gone to extraordinary lengths to try to avoid being hollowed out by the departure of middle - class and working - class residents			1
financed by a 1.5per cent charge on real estate sales and a mandate that any new projects include affordable housing , the city and county run a 40 - year - old program that allows people who have worked for one year or longer in @entity8 to rent , or buy , cheap residences			1
growing concern : resort towns like @entity8 dramatically demonstrate an unnerving trend : across the country , the rich are getting richer while the rest of the country is essentially treading water some of these properties are in prime position , like one - bedroom ski - in , ski - out units at the base of the lifts downtown , added to a new development to comply with the city 's regulations			1
the properties are allocated in an online lottery			0
before the internet age , the whole town was riveted by suspense over who would win a cherished affordable home			0
names were drawn out of a hopper , and the event was broadcast live on the local radio station			0
doctors and lawyers , as priced out of most homes here as carpenters and bartenders , take advantage of the program			0
everyone in town praises the program for maintaining a critical mass of year - round families that give @entity8 a more lived - in feel than many of its competitors			1
' most ski towns are 20 and drunk , and 75 and retired , ' said @entity187 , 47 , an @entity8 city councilman , father of two and former banker who was able to buy a house outside the affordable housing program - what 's referred to as a ' free market ' property			1
the housing program has helped maintain part of @entity8 's legend , a place where ski bums and teachers rubbed shoulders with rock stars and millionaires in the 1960s and 1970s - and today with billionaires and hedge fund titans			1
but many in town grumble about inequality			0
the mordant joke is that the billionaires are pushing out the millionaires			0
cheaper eateries frequented by locals are relentlessly replaced by upscale restaurants and high - end shops , and even the @entity8 realtor 's association office was pushed out of town because it could n't afford to pay the skyrocketing rents			1
@entity187 said he does n't feel the town has changed , just income inequality nationally , which shows up here in a concentrated form			2
' in the 1970s , that upper , upper , upper echelon , they were making ten times more than the $ 40,000 - a - year teacher , ' @entity187 said			2
' that same group that shows up here , they are 100 times wealthier than the painter , than the teacher , than the ski bum , than they were in the ' 80s			0
the homes are bigger , the jets are bigger			0
' @entity234 , however , warned that @entity8 's feel is different than a decade or two ago , when year - round residents lived in all parts of town			1
' when i moved to town , you could rent a room one of those houses on the west end , and the owner would come out for the music festival in the summer , ' said @entity75 , who arrived in 1979			2
' now the guy does n't need your $ 400 - a - month and does n't want you trampling on the carpet			0
' some here say living amid rampant inequality is just the price one pays for residing in what locals sometimes call ' @entity253 for adults			0
' @entity255 , a former official in president @entity257 's administration who writes a blog critical of @entity8 's political establishment , said she has grown tired of complaints			2
' there 's that sense that , my @entity265 , their lives would have been so much better if they lived in @entity267 , ' she said			0
' @entity8 ca n't exist without high - end tourists			1
they signed up for that			0
' that 's why @entity272 moved to these mountains from @entity274			0
the 25 - year - old construction worker ca n't afford the prices in town and lives dozens of miles away in a mobile home park			0
but he does n't resent the wealthy			0
' the company where i work builds houses for rich people , and because of that it pays well , ' @entity272 said			0
' one way or another , we help each other out			0

from 2009 to 2012 , inflation - adjusted income for the wealthiest one per cent of @entity3 households surged 31per cent , according to economist @entity39 of the @entity40
for everyone else , income inched up just 0.4per cent
