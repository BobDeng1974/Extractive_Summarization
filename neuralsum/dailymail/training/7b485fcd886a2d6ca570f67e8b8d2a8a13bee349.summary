@entity1 's big beasts were last night at war over @entity4 ’s controversial election campaign tactics			1
lord @entity5 reacted with fury after two former @entity8 colleagues questioned their leader ’s relentless focus on the health service , rather than the economic legacy of @entity1			1
the former deputy prime minister branded @entity14 and @entity17 ‘ @entity16 collaborators ’			1
and mr @entity4 came under further pressure over claims that he said privately he is aiming to ‘ weaponise ’ the @entity20 as a campaign tool			2
‘ they have worked harder to distance themselves from @entity1 than to defend its record , ’ the two former ministers said in a joint article for the @entity35			1
‘ this hands the @entity16 a needless advantage			1
if @entity1 is to win in may , the two eds need to set the record straight and reclaim ground foolishly bequeathed to their opponents			0
’ on tuesday – the day of a big @entity20 campaign launch by mr @entity4 and shadow health secretary @entity46 – mr @entity17 warned @entity1 was making a fatal mistake if it positioned itself as the party that would put more money into the health service , without saying how it would introduce further reforms			1
‘ you ’ve got a pale imitation actually of the 1992 general election campaign			0
maybe it will have the same outcome , i do n’t know , ’ he added			0
and @entity14 said : ‘ we should avoid a re-run [ of 1992 ]			2
we can win the next election , we ought to win the next election			0
but we should n’t imagine that there are n’t some really difficult , hard choices to be made , not just about the economy , but also about the future shape of public services			0
‘ @entity1 has got to talk about the economy and have a message about what it will do to keep the economy moving ahead			2
’ @entity4 came under further pressure over claims that he said privately he is aiming to ‘ weaponise ’ the @entity20 as a campaign tool yesterday lord @entity5 raged : ‘ i see those @entity16 collaborators @entity17 and @entity14 are attacking @entity1 ’s brilliant @entity20 plan			1
’ in a reference to consultancy jobs undertaken by the pair since leaving office , the former deputy prime minister added : ‘ go back to advising @entity79 and the nuclear industry			2
’ but even some shadow ministers fear @entity1 is losing the battle on the economy – with latest figures showing the @entity85 is now pole position to be the strongest growing country in the developed world			2
@entity89 ‘ the very simple choice that people have in this next 24 hours is this			0
it is 24 hours to save our @entity20 ’ - april 1997 @entity95 ‘ i warn you not to be ordinary			0
i warn you not to be young			0
i warn you not to fall ill. i warn you not to get old			0
’ - june 1983 @entity97 ‘ now what they are apparently considering is the dismantlement of the health service itself , and the destruction of the essential socialist principles on which that health service was founded			1
well , we will fight them on all those matters with every power ’			0
- september 1982 @entity4 ‘ i make absolutely no apologies for the fact that i ’m really concerned about what ’s happening to our @entity20 ... ’ - two weeks ago @entity1 ’s plans suffered a further blow as @entity89 ’s former senior adviser on health warned its plans to use a mansion tax on expensive homes to fund more @entity20 staff would take two years to come fully on stream			1
professor @entity121 also claimed mr @entity46 is planning his own ‘ top - down re-organisation ’ by shifting responsibility for commissioning @entity20 services to ‘ health and well - being boards ’			2
mr @entity46 insisted professor @entity121 had ‘ misunderstood ’ his proposals			0
in a bruising interview with @entity130 , mr @entity46 came under pressure over @entity1 ’s claim that the use of private sector firms to provide free @entity20 services would mean ‘ the end of the health service as we know it ’			1
he was confronted by official figures showing less than six per cent of the @entity20 budget is outsourced to private and not - for - profit sectors – a small rise on the 4.4 per cent that involved such providers under @entity1			0
he repeatedly refused to say by how much @entity1 intended to reduce the involvement of alternative providers for free care if the party returns to power			0
the interventions by senior blairites are said to be part of campaign to prevent mr @entity46 becoming @entity1 leader if mr @entity4 loses the election and is ousted			0
in the @entity156 , mr @entity4 insisted the @entity20 was in ‘ crisis ’ , despite figures from the @entity160 survey showing dissatisfaction with the health service is at a record low			1
the prime minister said mr @entity4 was ‘ in a desperate mess ’ over the @entity20 and said @entity1 had wrecked services in @entity166 , where it is in government			1
he repeatedly called on the @entity1 leader to withdraw ‘ disgraceful ’ remarks he reportedly made in a briefing to @entity130 executives about ‘ weaponising ’ the @entity20 as an election issue			1
@entity1 ’s health plans include bringing in an extra 20,000 nurses and 8,000 gps , as well as guaranteeing gp appointments in 48 hours .			2

@entity17 condemned by @entity5 for attacking @entity1 's strategy
former deputy *pm* branded @entity14 and @entity17 ‘ @entity16 collaborators ’
it came after @entity14 and @entity17 questioned focus on health service
