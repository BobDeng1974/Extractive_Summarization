by @entity1 reporter published : 13:06 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 18 october 2013 both candidates vying to become the next @entity4 mayor have announced they support added vacation days for @entity7 public school students			1
@entity8 and frontrunner @entity9 said wednesday that it ’s only fair to give religious holidays off for the city @entity7 students just as they do for @entity15 and @entity16			1
his @entity18 opponent @entity17 agreed and said he ’s supported such a revision of the public school schedule throughout his candidacy			2
‘ we 'll have to extend the school days by those two days			0
but nonetheless those who are @entity7 will be allowed to have that day off to celebrate their holidays			0
’ ' those who are @entity7 will be allowed to have that day off ' : @entity9 's @entity18 rival @entity17 said wednesday that he 's supported @entity7 holidays in @entity4 schools throughout his campaign both candidates support days off for @entity4 ’s nearly 150,000 @entity7 public school students on the two most holy days of the @entity7 calendar , @entity41 and @entity42			1
‘ the origins of this nation , people of many different faiths coming together , ’ said @entity9			0
‘ that 's why we have to respect @entity7 faiths by providing the @entity41 school holidays for children in our school system			1
’ @entity52 pointed out that , like @entity54 or @entity55 , these @entity7 fall on different days each year , which can force students to choose between education and faith			2
‘ a child who has an exam on a day that right now is one of the @entity41 holidays , they 're either respecting their religious obligation or they 're doing what their education requires of them			0
they ca n't do both under our current system , ’ de @entity9 said wednesday at an event in @entity25 for @entity24			0
in 2006 , an @entity41 holiday fell on a day of required state - wide tests			0
arguments for and against the instatement of @entity7 school holidays have been echoing around @entity4 for years , but three - term mayor @entity80 has continued to oppose them			1
‘ everybody would like to be recognized , but the truth of the matter is we need more school days , not less , ’ the mayor said in 2009			2
unfair ? while both @entity16 and @entity15 students see their holy days observed with days off from school , the city 's nearly 150,000 @entity7 students get none of their holidays off from school two more holidays would bring the number of days off per year for @entity4 students to 15			1
currently , none of those days are for @entity7 holidays , though around 13 percent of public school children in the city are believed to practice @entity103			1
state law requires all schools be open for 183 total days , but does not stipulate which days specifically			0
the issue is one on which the two starkly different candidates can actually agree			0
at a televised debate tuesday , they disagreed on issues ranging from tax hikes to public safety to their baseball allegiances , each presenting themselves as the most qualified choice to lead a city preparing to take its first steps beyond the 12 - year reign of mayor @entity80			1
@entity4 will cast their vote and despite between the two starkly different candidates november 5			0
' everybody would like to be recognized ' : @entity124 , seen here greeting cardinal @entity125 , has remained a vocal opponent to @entity7 school holidays during his campaign			2

both candidates say the city schools should observe the @entity7 holy days of @entity41 and @entity42
around 13 percent of @entity4 public school students practice @entity103
' everybody would like to be recognized ' : mayor @entity80 has *staunchly* opposed the added days off
