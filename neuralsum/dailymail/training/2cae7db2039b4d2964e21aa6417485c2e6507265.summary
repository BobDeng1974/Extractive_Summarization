@entity0 is the leading contender to replace sacked @entity1 with @entity2 keen to make an appointment by the weekend			1
the former @entity5 head coach came close to landing the @entity7 job last summer but talks collapsed over wages and @entity0 ’s desire to bring in assistants @entity11 and @entity13			2
those hurdles could be overcome on this occasion with the futures of current assistants @entity18 and @entity19 uncertain			0
@entity1 has been sacked as manager of @entity2 after a difficult start to the season former @entity5 boss @entity0 is the early favourite to take over at the @entity2 ' the individual progress of our players such as @entity27 and @entity28 are testament to that			1
' but sadly that simply has not translated into results and they remain the ultimate currency of @entity1 's position			0
' securing a sixth season in the @entity36 is the over-riding target and sometimes unpleasant decisions have to be taken to serve that imperative			0
@entity1 's team have been on a bad run and they were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity41 in the @entity36 on sunday the pair will take charge of @entity2 for the clash with @entity45 on @entity46 ’ s day but a club statement announcing @entity49 ’s sacking failed to guarantee their futures			1
@entity52 is also in the frame but it is unclear how he would work within @entity2 ’s continental structure where head coach leaves transfers to the technical director , in this case @entity60			2
the club announced @entity1 's departure with immediate effect on monday night with the @entity64 being placed on gardening leave			2
' we appointed @entity1 in the summer convinced that we had taken on one of the foremost coaches in the @entity69 and nothing that has happened since then has altered our view , ' technical director @entity60 said			0
' @entity1 has impressed everyone with his manner , dedication and diligence but he knows that results have simply not been good enough			0
' we place on record our gratitude for his efforts and hold nothing but good wishes for his future endeavours			0
this was a decision taken with regret but sadly driven by necessity			0
' defender @entity86 looks dejected after @entity2 concededed the second goal to @entity41 on sunday chairman @entity88 , who fired both @entity89 and @entity90 last season , had been keen to make the summer appointment of @entity49 work and knows the players have been fully behind his methods			1
but after travelling fans subjected @entity49 to a barrage of abuse at the end of sunday 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity41 , the 56 - year - old 's time at the @entity7 has come to an end			1
@entity1 has overseen a dismal run of results that have seen @entity2 win just once in the last nine @entity36 games , leaving the club one point above the relegation zone .			1

@entity2 have only won once in their last nine @entity36 games
@entity1 was subjected to barrage of abuse after 2 - 0 defeat by @entity41
