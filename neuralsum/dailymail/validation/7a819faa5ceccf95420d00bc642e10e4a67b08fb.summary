@entity0 faces one of the toughest challenges of his unbeaten career as he takes on perhaps the most decorated @entity5 jiu jitsu practitioner ever to grace the @entity6 in @entity7			1
@entity8 proved against welterweight title challenger @entity9 last year that once he takes control from the top , there is no way out			2
but while @entity16 @entity15 acknowledges the tough test that lies ahead , he believes he will hold the advantage in the striking and wrestling departments			1
@entity0 will be hoping to make it 12 from 12 when he takes on @entity7 at @entity22 fight night 62 @entity23 kicks his opponent @entity24 during their bout at @entity26 in @entity27 veteran fighter @entity8 ( left ) , pictured fighting @entity29 , will pose a real threat to @entity23 's record ' the guy is one of the top guys in the world , you know , of course he 's good , ' he told @entity37			1
' i 'm just a little better			0
i think that his striking is maybe a little more basic for me			0
' i think i have a little bit more of an awkward , outside of the box approach to it and i think that that 's something i can use			0
a lot of his wrestling is pretty basic and i 've been wrestling my whole life , so that 's another thing i can use			2
' having been out of action for nearly a year after being struck down with a bone infection last august , @entity8 is reporting a clean bill of health ahead of the contest and the submission specialist is looking to impress his countrymen in @entity56			1
' i am very proud to be here in @entity5 again , ' he said			2
' i 'm very happy with the opportunity the @entity22 has given me , to fight a main event here in @entity56 , a city i love - especially returning from an injury			0
i am 100 per cent now , i feel much stronger than i felt in my past camps			0
' @entity8 poses duriong the @entity22 @entity64 weigh ins at @entity66 earlier on friday and when it comes to @entity23 's 11 - 0 record , which includes four consecutive wins under the @entity22 banner , @entity8 knows that he will have to be on top form to put the first blemish on the @entity75 's clean record			1
' i will need to want to win the fight a lot more than he wants to , ' he added			0
' because i know he has a lot of will power , but i need to have more than him			0
' despite other fighters citing their reluctance to face off against a @entity5 opponent on their home turf , @entity23 believes that the crowd will offer @entity8 no advantage once the @entity6 door shuts			1
' i do n't think it makes any difference to me			0
once the @entity6 doors are shut , it 's just me and him in the cage , ' he said			2
' some people could think differently but , for me , it 's just me and him â€“ just another day in the office			0
' the @entity5 @entity64 's co-main event packs a huge punch as well , as spectacular striker @entity102 faces off against polarizing @entity22 veteran @entity103			1
stepping in as a late replacement for @entity106 , this is a must - win situation for ' @entity103 ' who is currently on four - fight losing streak in the @entity22			2
@entity103 , pictured here in 2012 against @entity110 , is looking to arrest his losing streak @entity102 ( left ) punches @entity112 in their welterweight bout during the @entity22 @entity64 in 2013			1

@entity116 has *arguably* never fought anyone on @entity7 's level
the @entity5 is one of the most decorated jiu jitsu practitioners to grace the @entity6
but @entity123 believes he holds the advantage in the wrestling and striking departments
@entity8 is looking to end @entity23 's unbeaten run with a finish in front of his countrymen
@entity103 needs a win against spectacular striker @entity102 in the co-main event
