for the @entity1 , a wedding photo album is so passé			0
instead , @entity3 's brides are purchasing 3d dolls which are exact replicas of themselves as they appear on their special day			1
the @entity5 in @entity6 creates versions of real people and even pets			0
the high - tech process involves multiple digital slr cameras taking photos of a person ’s or animal ’s head from different angles , computers stitching the pictures and data together and a special 3d printer using layers of plaster and ink to mould the 3d sculptures			1
uncanny : the clones are printed using layers of ink which harden in the plaster priced at £ 932 ( 138,000 @entity1 yen ) , the lifelike 3d - printed dolls are unbelievably detailed and immortalise the model			0
though the outcome is somewhat eerie , the cloning service is especially popular among @entity1 women looking to preserve a special moment in life such as their wedding day			2
they clone their hair , make - up and even the dress they wore for the complete look			2
the factory advises people from abroad who fancy owning a clone of themselves to book their session a few days in advance of their trip , as the factory needs this time to prepare			2
@entity1 blogger @entity50 , who runs the @entity52 website , went down to the factory to try out the machine and report on the process of being ' cloned '			1
at the start of the clone doll creation process , @entity50 was instructed to sit still in a chair in the middle of the room is surrounded by digital slr cameras - with even some on the ceiling			1
multiple cameras then began looping around his head and rays started taking ' slices of measurements '			1
this process lasted only a few seconds			2
write caption here cloning their hair style , make - up and clothes ( not forgetting face ) , @entity1 women are big customers once all the data was prepared , his clone was printed with a @entity78 650 using layers of ink which harden in a tray of plaster where the clone is born			0
when the process is complete , the tray of plaster remains completely unchanged on the surface			0
the final product is then covered in a top coat for protection			0
@entity50 ( left ) and his immortal clone doll on the body of a @entity93 character ( right ) the cloning product is called @entity95 ( 自分さん ) - which roughly translated as ' me '			1
the surface of the printed objects can be slightly rough due to the limitations of the printer			0
smoother surfaces can be achieved by using more expensive printers such as one called @entity104 , which prints baby smooth surfaces			0
a few days after the production process , @entity50 's clone was ready for collection and as requested , embodies his head atop a @entity111 figurine			1
@entity50 was to sit still in a chair in the middle of the room is surrounded by digital slr cameras a 3d model of his head is created from all the stats taken in the data capturing process the clone is printed using layers of ink hardening in plaster			1
afterwards , the tray of plaster remains unchanged next to the printer is another machine which removes excess plaster			0
a jet of air aids the cleaning of @entity50 's clone @entity50 takes the opportunity for a quick snap with the @entity134 before heading off other clones in the office include the chap in gold , who is famous @entity1 pop star @entity139 pictured is the boss of @entity142 together with his clone			2
