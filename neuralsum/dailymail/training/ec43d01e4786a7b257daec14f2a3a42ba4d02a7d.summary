by @entity0 last updated at 2:00 am on 29th january 2012 guilty : music teacher @entity1 admitted telling police that she was the victim of three armed robberies - when in fact she had launched the knife attacks on herself a piano teacher ’s reputation lay in ruins yesterday after she was unmasked as a hoaxer who triggered a massive police manhunt by falsely claiming she was being stalked by a crazed ' psycho slasher '			1
@entity1 , 41 , mutilated her own hands with a kitchen knife and slapped herself in the face - then wrongly alleged her injuries were caused by a sinister assailant who attacked her three times in 12 weeks at her music shop and farmhouse home			1
@entity1 also sent herself poison pen text messages and abusive @entity26 cards reading : ' it ’s your last b * * * * ' and ' you ’re dead b * * * * ' and helped officers create an e-fit of the fictitious assailant			1
@entity1 ’s husband @entity32 , also a musician , was so worried about the terror campaign he went onto the internet and bought his wife a stab - proof vest and a stun gun for protection			1
@entity39 staged a major operation to track down the stalker , gave @entity43 police protection when she left work , and referred their inquiries onto murder squad detectives			1
they even scrambled the force helicopter to search for suspects			0
police eventually arrested an innocent man , held him for 18 hours and forced him to take part in an @entity53 parade before releasing him without charge			1
officers finally became suspicious of @entity1 ’s account when inquiries drew a blank and she later confessed she had made it up - claiming she was ' in a dark place ' following a minor bust up with a customer at her sheet music store in @entity63 , @entity64			1
she claimed she was due to carry out a fourth and fatal attack upon herself			1
the self - mutilation damaged the tendons in @entity43 's left thumb , and may affect her piano playing for the rest of her life			1
the bill for the police operation came to £ 10,000 in total			1
@entity1 broke down and wept at @entity75 as she admitted three charges of perverting the course of justice			0

she was also ordered to complete a three year community order during which she will seek help for her problems			0
poisonous : these images show the inside of the @entity26 cards and sympathy cards @entity1 sent to herself , pretending they were hate mail from a would - be attacker sympathy cards : the ' poison pen ' cards @entity1 sent herself were retained by the @entity95 as evidence of her guilt judge @entity98 told @entity99 : ' you are an educated woman , hardworking and a talented music teacher			1
' there ’s no explanation why a woman of 41 years old should embark on such a series of lies and exaggerations with serious consequences to you and everyone else			1
' it is a bizarre case , one of the most bizarre cases i ’ve come across as a judge , and it does not fall into the normal categories			0
usually the case is that is made against a named individual to false rape or the like and if a person lies like this they go to prison			0
' but i think there is some deep - seated problem in your character that caused you to behave like this			1
no good would come of imprisoning you and it might well be enough to stop you again given people will now know the lengths you went to			0
' @entity1 , who also teaches violin and guitar , spent years building up her music career			2
according to her website she was approached by @entity138 @entity137 to act as a demonstrator for their keyboards , and she played alongside husband @entity32 in a @entity143 tribute band called @entity144			2
the pair later set up their own music school together			0

mr @entity158 , prosecuting , said she had a 3cm wound on her forearm and was said to be ' visibly upset '			0
complete fiction : @entity1 helped @entity39 compile an e-fit of her non-existent attacker , and appealed to the public for help in catching the ' psychopath ' as well as handing in a blood - stained top and black headband to the police , she compiled an e-fit of one of her assailants and asked police to issue the picture and make a public appeal for information			1
the following month , @entity1 claimed she was by her vehicle in a car park when an @entity180 man stabbed and tried to rob her , saying , ' no f.			1
king white bitch is going to humiliate me			0
' mr @entity158 said : ' she was taken in the ambulance to the hospital and photos were taken in relation to the injury			0
the tendons on her left thumb were severed and a further operation was performed			0
' he added : ' the defendant had gone to @entity198 and bought a pay as you go mobile telephone , but police discovered that the phone had only been used to contact the defendant herself			1
' she claimed she had silent phone calls and another @entity26 card saying ' you ’re dead b * * * * '			1
police fully investigated the complaints			2
' the following january @entity99 reported a third attack at her home , saying that while she was putting the bins out a man had put a rope around her neck and slashed her with a knife			2
she claimed she had shot him with the stun gun and that she was also wearing the stab vest she had purchased			1
she had bruises to the right side of her face and a three inch deep wound which required seven stitches at hospital			0
at the time of the attacks @entity1 , who has been teaching piano , keyboard , guitar and violin for 11 years , claimed she was afraid to be in the shop alone after dark and gave an interview to her local newspaper about her ordeal			2
police later arrested an @entity180 man in @entity243 in relation to the alleged offences , and he was on bail for three days before officers told him no further action would be taken			1
@entity1 was arrested in march last year after police began to suspect the robberies had not actually happened			2
scene of the invented crime : the police investigation began in october 2010 when @entity1 claimed she had been attacked with a knife outside her @entity150 in @entity63 mr @entity158 said : ' because of the continued nature of the attacks police went down to try to safeguard the local area and the investigation cost police resources £ 10,000			1
' officers thought she had a potential stalker , and a considerable area of the community was affected			2
the allegations involved a racist element , police were very careful to investigate and it did n’t help race relations in the area			2
' a police helicopter was sent out as well as dog patrols and the police had to ensure officers were present when she left work			2
police had to refer the incident to the major incident team			2
' @entity1 initially denied any wrongdoing before breaking down and confessing to fabricating her ordeal			0
she also admitted illegal possession of the stun gun			1
in mitigation , defence lawyer @entity282 handed in testimonials from her pupils and husband , who is believed to be standing by her			0
mr @entity282 said : ' this was a bizarre series of actions			0
it was out of character for @entity1			0
she is a hard worker trying to make a success of two businesses , she is educated a talented musician trying to bring out the best in youngsters			0
' what occurred and her behaviour was more than attention - seeking			0
she was in a dark place - there is no psychiatric explanation , but there was a trigger			0
and the response to this trigger led to unforeseeable enactment , almost an acting out of a series of attacks , playing both the victim and the attacker			0
' by the time the police got involved seeing her as a suspect she had planned a final attack , and she would have taken her own life			0
even to this day she ca n’t explain these bizarre attacks			0
' after the case @entity318 @entity317 of @entity39 said : ' @entity1 falsely claimed she was a victim of three very serious offences and we put a significant amount of resources into investigating her claims			0
' this was a significant drain on police resources and whilst we would always urge all genuine victims to come forward and report incidents to the police , anyone making malicious claims will be dealt with robustly and brought to justice			0

claimed she was attacked three times in 12 weeks by crazed stalker
sent herself abusive @entity26 cards reading : ' it ’s your last b * * * * ' and ' you ’re dead b * * * * '
