by @entity0 late one night , lying in bed , i was on the verge of dropping off to sleep when my @entity5 suddenly vibrated on the bedside table beside me			1
who could possibly be texting at this hour ? for a fleeting moment i wondered whether to just leave it			2
but with a teenage daughter 70 miles away at boarding school , a mother 's instinct made me reach for the phone			1
what i saw in that moment seemed , on the surface , innocuous enough			2
but it was to signal the start of a five - day rollercoaster of eye - popping revelations and enough parental angst to turn every hair on my head permanently grey			2
@entity40 ! did you really escape last night ? your ( sic ) mad			2
. what time did you go into town ? ' then , before i had a chance to digest what i was seeing , a reply			2
' 2am ! it was cool			2
' by now , i was wide awake			2
for one tiny , lovely second i convinced myself i had experienced the equivalent of an old - fashioned crossed line - that the texts i 'd received were meant for someone else 's errant child			1
but there was no denying the name on the top of this delightful exchange ; that of my 13 - year - old daughter , @entity34			1
you may wonder - as did i - why i was suddenly receiving all her text messages			1
the following morning , my husband @entity63 got to the bottom of what was going on			2
a few days earlier we had upgraded @entity34 's old mobile to an iphone 4s			1
as anybody with an @entity72 device will know , there is this wonderful creation called @entity28 , which can sync together @entity72 products			2
right to read ? @entity0 could n't resist when @entity34 's messages were sent to her mobile because of this , @entity34 's mobile number was automatically logged in my settings menu as the account holder and also ticked , unbeknown to me , under the messages option			1
i defy any responsible parent not to consider this a serendipitous turn of events			2
no mother wants to stoop so low as having to secretly spy on their daughter 's online activity , but , deep down , we all wish we knew what they were up to when they have no idea we can see			1
but it only took 24 hours before i was reminded of that old adage : be careful what you wish for			2
because later that evening , long after lights - out at her all - girls boarding house , the texts started up again			2
the first was from a charming chap called @entity106			2
' shame your ( sic ) not going to the party on saturday night coz @entity109 woz gon na bring my condoms			2
' then one back from @entity34 : ' @entity111			1
your ( sic ) too kind but @entity112 ? ' speechless , i handed the phone over to @entity63 to read and watched as his face went puce			2
then , in a moment of breathtaking innocence , he turned to me and asked : ' what does @entity109 mean ? ' for those who do n't have the time to decipher teenage acronyms , @entity109 means ' to be honest '			2
@entity112 means ' what the f * * * '			2
a suitably comforting response , i felt , from my daughter			1
but things were about to get a lot worse			0
' @entity129 ? ' sent from @entity106			0
at this point everything was telling me i should turn the phone off and remain in blissful ignorance			0
@entity63 , echoing my thoughts , said : ' this is really bad			1
we should stop looking now			0
' ' r u a dirty smoker ? ' @entity106 asked			0
by now i had my hands over my face , peeping through my fingers			0
two seconds later @entity34 pinged back : ' pahaha			1
not dirty , just normal			0
' it 's hard to know how , to react when faced with a side to your daughter you never thought you would see			1
of all our four children , @entity34 has always seemed the easiest			1
happy - go - lucky , sports - mad , not in the least bit rebellious			0
if i was to take this communication at face value , my lovely girl had morphed into a swearing , smoking , sex - mad escapologist with incredibly poor grammar			1
as usual when it comes to parenting matters , @entity63 's reaction differed to mine			1
my gut feeling was to call the school , haul @entity34 out and interrogate her			1
he argued the texts could be teenage bravado			0
we 'd brought this dilemma on ourselves			0
do nothing and we risked never knowing what she was really up to			1
confront @entity34 and we could alienate her			1
insight : teen texting is a world of poor grammar , swearing and sexual innuendo ( posed by model ) i 'm sure there are many parents reading this and leaping to judge our duplicitous actions			1
but let me ask you this			0
what is worse ? seizing a rare opportunity to get a glimpse into your child 's life , or sticking your parental head in the ground ? friends were firm advocates of the latter			1
' i 'd rather not know , ' one mother told me			0
' frankly , it 's the stuff of nightmares			1
' by day three , i was inclined to agree			0
the world of teenage instant messaging is one you enter at your peril			0
for starters every other word is interjected with ' ahaha ' or ' pahaha ' - a demonstration of laughter			0
then there 's the endless boy - girl banter			1
i suppose i should n't have been surprised			0
except i naively assumed she did n't know any boys			1
' u r fit , ' one boy texted her			0
' @entity212 babe , ' she replied with all the insouciance of a seasoned flirt			0
in another text she asked a boy called @entity217 : ' do you like me ? ' i had just enough time to think : ' well , that â€™s sweet , ' before he pinged back : ' yer , i 'd do u. ' throughout all this @entity63 was , i sensed , in paternal turmoil			0
personally , i had no moral issue with what we were doing			0
we were , after all , paying for the phone			0
he , on the other hand , worried if @entity34 found out she would never trust us again			1
my concerns felt more fundamental			0
what was keeping me awake at night , clutching my phone , was the concern that my daughter was turning into a tart and veering spectacularly off the rails			1
text mania 145 billion texts were sent in the @entity237 in 2013 luckily , a weekend home from boarding school was approaching			0
as you can imagine , i was desperate to see @entity34 , but if her texts were anything to go by the feeling was n't reciprocated			1
' have to go home this weekend ( sad face )			0
' this was a slap in the face but , probably , served me right			0
after all , what you do n't know ca n't hurt you			0
things came to a head that following weekend			0
@entity34 's face went from shock , through to horror , through to outrage as the penny slowly dropped			1
' are you smoking and who are @entity217 , @entity106 and @entity38 ? ' i ranted as she cried			0
i stopped short of asking her if she was having sex - the very notion of it being a possibility was so horrendous i just could n't form the words			0
she made a breathtakingly brazen attempt to protest along the lines that what we had done was wholly unacceptable			0
she even tried to argue about privacy rights - something which caused @entity63 to take her phone and shove it in a drawer			0
too much information : @entity0 wo n't be looking at her daughter 's messages again ( posed by model ) afterwards , feeling frazzled , we went for a long dog - walk			1
' it 's just banter and teenage stuff @entity279 , ' she told me			1
i know , ultimately , that @entity34 is a great girl with a sensible head on her shoulders			1
which , i suppose , just begs the question - what did all this achieve ? perhaps it is better to simply trust and leave things there			0
teenagers will always behave differently with their peers			0
it 's just , in my day , my mother luckily never knew anything about it			1
so @entity34 has her phone back with a stern lecture on online behaviour			1
and i have unticked her number in my settings ,			1
i did this with a huge sense of relief because my week as a tourist in the land of adolescent acronyms and hormonal repartee was such hell i never want to go back there again .			0

@entity34 's messages came through to @entity0 's mobile by *accident*
she was shocked by number of boys contacting her daughter
messages were full of swearing , sexual *references* and bad grammar
was @entity324 better off not knowing about the exchanges ?
