a @entity1 fan who bears an uncanny resemblance to @entity3 is begging his fellow supporters to leave him alone after continually being mistaken for the star striker			1
the @entity7 man , who has not been named , is such a dead ringer for @entity9 he is constantly pestered by fans demanding photos and autographs			1
things came to a head last weekend when he flew in to watch @entity1 take on @entity15 and struggled to get anyway near @entity16 because he was being mobbed by supporters			1
he said : ' when i was in the @entity34 everyone , even the children , said , " this is @entity3 " – the whole street			0
' and i always say , ‘ i ’m not @entity3			0
' people there are crazy and i have to keep saying " i ’m not @entity3 , please do n’t touch me "			0
' the man , who has not been named , says he is being constantly pestered by @entity1 fans asking for photos and autographs the @entity7 @entity3 was pictured watching @entity1 play @entity15 by the @entity30 tv channel who later filmed an hilarious video which has become a @entity44 hit goal : the @entity7 @entity3 now says he wants to meet the striker and have his picture taken with him but if anything the video only appears to have made the problem worse after being viewed almost 90,000 times on @entity44			1
and the doppelganger managed to complicate the issue even further when he posed for pictures with @entity3 's @entity1 strike partner @entity55			2
it is not clear whether @entity55 himself was fooled by the resemblance			0
the @entity7 @entity3 says he now wants to meet the famous striker claims so he can pose for a picture .			2
