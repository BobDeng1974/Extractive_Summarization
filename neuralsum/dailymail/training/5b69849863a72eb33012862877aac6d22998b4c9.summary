there are times when you watch @entity3 and wonder how the @entity5 winger is supposed to cope with all this attention			1
he does not seek fame , is rarely pictured outside of a football stadium and behaves impeccably when he is wearing @entity5 colours			1
instead @entity3 pays a heavy price for those dancing feet because whenever he steps on to a football pitch he is kicked all over it			1
@entity3 was fouled a remarkable nine times during @entity5 's clash with @entity16 @entity17 goes in with studs showing during @entity16 's @entity20 clash with @entity5 how was @entity21 not sent off for this ? the @entity24 midfielder went in with two feet against hazard here in @entity27 , in this @entity20 clash against @entity16 , he was fouled more times than any other player so far this season in the competition			1
nine free - kicks borders on vendetta status and it is not a record @entity37 ’s side should be proud of after this filthy first leg			2
this is the list of @entity16 players who nailed @entity3 in @entity41 and it does not make for good reading			1
this is grim : @entity17 ( 3 ) , @entity49 ( 2 ) , @entity48 ( 1 ) , @entity47 ( 1 ) , @entity46 ( 1 ) , @entity45 ( 1 )			1
hang your heads in shame , guys , because this is not the way god meant this great game to be played			0
they took it in turns here to put the reducer on @entity5 ’s left winger , queuing up whenever - and sadly , wherever - he was in possession			1
this nothing to be proud of at @entity16			2
to think that the @entity66 once coveted hazard , before he signed his new super-contract last week , this had the stench of retribution for ignoring their passionate advances			0
he was kicked all over the place			0
@entity5 defender @entity73 heads in the opening goal of the game late in the first half @entity77 , who has often been in @entity48 's shadow at @entity16 celebrates scoring the equaliser @entity17 was easily the worst culprit , slicing through him on a night when @entity82 referee @entity81 should have shown far more than two yellow cards to @entity16 ’s players			1
the @entity16 midfielder covered more ground - most of it spent chasing @entity3 around the field - than any other player on the pitch in this first leg			1
this guy needs to have a look at his game			0
@entity95 made a bee - line for him afterwards , pointing out the hatchet man in this @entity16 team after a series of assaults on the @entity5 forward			1
‘ in @entity102 you like to bring up some other discussions , but this point is important because of what happened today , ’ declared @entity95			0
‘ for example , what happened with @entity17			2
if it is another player , they will stay on the floor , they will roll on the grass and scream - these kids will ask for cards			0
‘ this kid hazard is pure			0
when he goes to the floor it is for a reason and there were nine fouls on him			0
in the @entity122 it is exactly the same , but it is only now that you ask this question			0
’ quite how the @entity5 forward keeps his composure , keeping his mouth shut when the temptation was to complain to the referee is a skill in itself			2
is this how we want the modern game to be played , to watch the artists taken out by the cloggers waiting their turn to mug him in midfield ? is he supposed to put up with this because he is paid £ 200,000 - a - week , that somehow the cash is a cushion for some of the crash landings ? @entity21 fouled hazard three times on tuesday night , more than any other player @entity48 races away from @entity151 midfielder @entity149 during the first half on tuesday night if there is an argument that he goes down too softly it is because every time he dips his shoulder , there was a threat that some bully in a @entity16 shirt would try to take him out			1
there is no finer sight in football than watching @entity3 on the ball as he glides across some of the best defences in the game before picking out a killer pass			2
despite the thunderous challenges , his appetite is undiminished			0
‘ it happens game after game , ’ added @entity95			0
‘ give cards to the opponents , follow the rules of the game and it is was simple as that			0
’ these latest attacks are no accident , they are not a freak of football because the trend and temptation to rough him up in the @entity122 is also too much for some			0
this season , according to the analysts @entity194 , the @entity192 winger has been fouled a staggering 74 times , more than any other player in the country			1
@entity95 called it right here , demanding protection for @entity3 after another night when he was an obvious target for another savaging			2
he survived , emerging unscathed as this first leg threatened to boil over following @entity205 ’s clever second half equaliser			0
back at @entity206 this weekend , when @entity5 take on @entity207 , @entity95 will get another chance to cry foul			2
hazard shouts out in pain after being fouled at the @entity27 @entity211 was beaten in the air by the @entity213 forward for the goal early in the second half @entity95 issues instructions to his team during the second half in @entity41			1

@entity5 drew 1 - 1 with @entity16 at the @entity27
@entity73 opened the scoring before @entity77 equalised
@entity3 was fouled nine times by @entity16 's players
@entity17 in particular targeted the @entity192 winger
