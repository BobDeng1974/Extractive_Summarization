@entity1 head coach @entity0 has distanced himself from the club ’s recruitment policy and denounced the lack of quality in his side			1
the @entity8 ’s latest dig at the club hierarchy — led by sporting director @entity10 — comes just days before the @entity11			1
after five draws from their last six matches , @entity0 has confessed that he does not enjoy watching the team play			1
and he insists that the responsibility for bringing in players to lift the ‘ boredom ’ is not in his remit			2
‘ that is down to recruitment			1
i am a head coach			2
i am not going to be a head coach when it suits people and a manager when it does n’t			2
that side of it is down to recruitment			2
‘ so , if you ever get the chance to speak to anyone on the recruitment side and ask them about it ( signing players ) , you are lucky			2
if you do n’t , do n’t ask me			0
‘ if we do n’t get more quality there is going to be more games like that ( saturday ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity22 )			1
it will be 38 games and 38 points			2
if we lose two or three everyone will start panicking and having heart attacks			0
’ the @entity1 are 15th in the @entity26 , two points above the relegation zone			1
they have won just twice all season and have 10 draws — including five 0 - 0s			1
@entity66 netted a penalty for the hosts before @entity23 equalised but the @entity1 struggled @entity69 missed an easy chance on saturday and has n't scored a league goal for a year ‘ we are passing the ball as well as we can , given the quality of our players , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ when we get into the last third the delivery needs to be better			0
the finishing needs to be better			0
heading needs to be better			0
‘ the shot needs to be in the right time			0
maybe take a touch and make space before shooting			0
hit the target , not a body in front of you			0
do i think i ’ll get it ? i do n’t know			0
’ @entity0 wants to make a renewed approach for former loanee @entity97			1
@entity98 accepted a £ 14million bid during the summer but the @entity101 forward chose to remain at @entity102			0
@entity1 ’s transfer team , however , do not want to go back in for @entity97 and that could further upset the head coach			1
@entity0 , when asked when he will replace his misfiring strikers , said : ‘ when i have got another one			1
‘ i would love to play with wingers and two strikers			0
our wingers have got some ability , they can do certain things , but they can not defend or run the quantity they need to run			0
’ @entity0 wants to make a renewed bid for @entity97 - the striker was on loan at @entity1 last season @entity1 had a £ 14million bid for @entity97 ( left ) accepted in the summer , but he opted to stay at @entity98			1

@entity1 have only won two league games this season , drawing 10
after the draw with @entity22 @entity0 said he was n't enjoying himself
