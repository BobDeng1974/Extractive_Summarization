this time last season there was sudden hope for @entity3 , too			1
from the mist of poor football and modest results emerged a 3 - 0 home win against @entity8 in the @entity9			0
glimpses of what we presumed was the real @entity3 were seen once more			1
a win at @entity14 followed in the @entity15 but then the opposition hardened			1
@entity17 arrived at @entity18 and took another huge chunk out of @entity3 ’s credibility			1
it was a crushing loss for @entity3 from which they , and manager @entity22 , never recovered			1
@entity3 manager @entity23 pictured during his press conference on friday @entity25 recognises the rivalry between @entity3 and @entity27 is among the most fierce in football once again this weekend , @entity3 will attempt to build on something they hope will prove to be of substance			1
last weekend ’s surprising 3 - 0 dismantling of @entity32 has lifted spirits for @entity23 and his team , but once again opposition of real calibre threatens to cast a shadow across @entity3 ’s new dawn			1
and this time it is the greatest foe of all			2
the very mention of their name is enough to harden a @entity45 stare			0
‘ they will always be our greatest rivals , ’ sir @entity46 used to say			0
at @entity49 on sunday , @entity27 and @entity3 begin in earnest a fight not for a @entity9 title or @entity54 eminence but for respectability			1
a scuffle for a top - four place is one motivated certainly by money but more by old - fashioned pride			0
for @entity3 , to finish outside the @entity9 places once again is unthinkable			1
if they really are to find the form they will need to see them through an uncomfortable run of fixtures between now and the season ’s end , one feels it really needs to start here			0
@entity70 ( centre ) and his @entity3 team - mates train ahead of the trip to @entity27 on sunday @entity25 revealed that the @entity3 team chef has been helping his side prepare for their @entity15 clash @entity78 and @entity79 battle for the ball during training on friday ahead of @entity27 ‘ the win ( against @entity32 ) means nothing if you lose the next one and @entity27 is not a ground where this club has won a lot , ’ said @entity25			1
‘ if we show that form again in @entity27 then we are little bit further along			1
for our fans , it ’s the enemy and it ’s very important			0
‘ but the last time they lost in the league was against us			1
it was a long time ago so this will be very difficult			0
’ @entity27 have issues of their own to deal with between now and mid-may			1
@entity100 ’s contract stand - off will worry them while @entity103 ’s farewell from the club this summer needs to be handled properly			0
on the field , though , @entity27 have the better form			2
monday night ’s win at @entity108 was a little fortuitous but @entity27 are now unbeaten in 21 domestic matches and if that ’s not daunting enough , they play exactly the kind of football the modern @entity3 hate			1
‘ i have played their system , ’ said @entity25			0
‘ it ’s not new			0
’ @entity118 scores against @entity27 during their 3 - 0 pummelling at @entity18 in december the last time @entity27 lost in the @entity15 was at @entity18 against @entity3 back in december @entity118 ( from left to right ) , @entity121 and @entity70 celebrate during their 3 - 0 win over @entity27 @entity124 celebrates scoring against @entity27 and @entity3 will hope they can do the same at @entity49 nevertheless , while his own side currently tends to play football by numbers — methodical and at times predictable — @entity27 are more instinctive			1
ironically , that was evident the last time @entity27 lost in the league , at @entity18 back in december			1
the score was 3 - 0 to @entity3 that day but it was totally unrepresentative of the match pattern as their opponents began to use a three - man defensive line which manager @entity135 has stuck with ever since			2
‘ i was impressed that day , ’ said @entity135			0
‘ the result was n’t great and we had criticism because we lost but i was pleased with how dynamic the team looked			2
‘ we looked fast again			0
that gave me the real confidence			0
i knew i needed to be radical because we were so far off from where we wanted to be			0
it ’s about putting in place something the players can fully believe in			0
’ @entity3 manager @entity25 will have to be on guard against an in - form @entity27 unbeaten in 2015 in the league @entity27 play quickly and love to go on the counter-attack , which @entity25 will have to prepare his team for @entity27 , as we know , play quickly , love to counter and have the kind of midfield runners who trouble earnest but limited defensive midfield players such as @entity3 ’s @entity153			1
if @entity3 are to profit on sunday they must hope to take their opportunities and defend resolutely			1
it can be done , of course			0
for all @entity27 ’s attacking prowess , they can have days when they hit brick walls , days when the timing is out			2
@entity135 still has not fathomed a @entity160 and it ’s worth noting that for all the plaudits which followed @entity27 ’s recent win at home to @entity17 , both goals came from distance			2
@entity3 do generally defend well and their goalkeeper remains on form			2
the save @entity170 produced from @entity171 towards the end of @entity3 ’s @entity174 defeat at home to @entity176 11 days ago was testimony to that			2
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity170 has been in fine form for @entity25 in the @entity15 this year @entity27 must find their way past an in - form @entity181 if they are to get revenge for their 3 - 0 defeat a year ago , good goalkeeping was not enough to help @entity3 mask their deficiencies			1
as it turned out , their victory over @entity8 was little more than a shaft of light during a season that resembled a nine - month eclipse			0
this time we still do n’t know which way they are heading			0
on friday night , @entity25 suggested sunday will not be definitive			0
‘ the fight will last until the end , ’ he said			0
if it does , given their fixture list , the @entity3 manager will have done very well indeed .			2
