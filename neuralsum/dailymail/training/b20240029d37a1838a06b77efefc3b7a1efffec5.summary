a radical new weapon that can fire a shell at seven times the speed of sound has been shown off in public for the first time			1
described as ' @entity8 technology ' by researchers , the railgun can fire shells at seven times speed of sound , and penetrate concrete 100 miles away			1
two prototypes of the weapon have been developed for the @entity28 – one by @entity32 arms manufacturer @entity30 and the second by a @entity35 firm			1
the @entity30 version was shown off this week			2
rear admiral @entity37 , head of @entity35 @entity38 , said the futuristic electromagnetic railgun – so called because it fires from two parallel rails – had already undergone extensive testing on land			1
it will be mounted on high - speed vessel the @entity45 for sea trials in 2016			1
' it 's now reality and it 's not science fiction , ' admiral @entity37 said			2
an electromagnetic railgun is a gun that uses just electricity – no gun powder – and … can shoot a projectile well over 100 miles at @entity57			1
energetic weapons , such as @entity60 railguns , are the future of naval combat			0
' electromagnetic launchers were one of the areas researched by @entity66 's @entity8 , nicknamed ' @entity8 ' after the science fiction film franchise			0
rear admiral @entity37 , head of @entity35 @entity38 , said the futuristic electromagnetic railgun – so called because it fires from two parallel rails – had already undergone extensive testing on land admiral @entity37 added : ' it will help us in air defence , it will help us in cruise missile defence , it will help us in ballistic missile defence … we 're also talking about a gun that 's going to shoot a projectile that 's about one one - hundredth of the cost of an existing missile system today			1
' it … will give our adversaries a huge moment of pause to go , ' do i even want to go engage a naval ship ? '			0
' the weapon uses speed rather than explosives to destroy its target and comes equipped with the menacing @entity93 motto ' i , who am speed , eradicate ' warships can carry dozens of conventional missiles , which cost around £ 600,000 each , but could be loaded with hundreds of railgun projectiles , at only £ 15,000 each			1
the projectiles , @entity100 , are also under developemtn by @entity30			2
it is a next - generation , guided projectile capable of completing multiple missions for the @entity105 , as well as existing 5 - inch and 155 - mm gun systems			0
' the @entity100 takes the next evolutionary step in providing an affordable , precise , multi-mission capability for multiple gun platforms , ' said @entity110 , vice president and general manager of @entity112 at @entity30			0
' we look forward to applying our expertise and technologies to this important program			0
' the @entity100 is designed to provide lethality and performance enhancements to current and future gun systems			0
the objective of the first phase is to produce a concept design and development roadmap towards fully guided flight demonstrations			0
the weapon uses speed rather than explosives to destroy its target and comes equipped with the menacing @entity93 motto ' i , who am speed , eradicate '			1
using an electromagnetic force known as the @entity134 , the gun accelerates a projectile between two rails that conduct electricity , before launching it at ferocious speed			2
this means the railgun can fire further than conventional guns and maintain enough kinetic energy to inflict tremendous damage			1
railguns were first conceived of nearly a century ago and patented by @entity147 inventor @entity146			0
@entity148 took up the research during the @entity150 to adapt its anti-aircraft guns			0
the first sea trials of the new railguns will take place in 2016 aboard high - speed vessel the @entity45 ( artist 's impression above )			2

technology fires a shell weighing 10kg at up to 5,400mph over 100 miles
warships can carry dozens of conventional missiles , costing around £ 600,000 each , but could be loaded with hundreds of railgun projectiles , at only £ 15,000 each
weapon uses speed rather than explosives to destroy its target and comes equipped with menacing @entity93 motto ' i , who am speed , eradicate '
