way , a serial entrepreneur who started his first business aged 15 , made $ 33 million by 17 and lost it all by 21 only to build his wealth again , intentionally does n't reveal whether he 's a man or a woman until half way down the article , so readers hear him out before offering judgement			1

couple : the @entity30 - born 33 - year - old met his younger ex , shown with him above , after moving to the states he writes that while his ex promised it 'd never happen again , ' it did happen again and again , life was never the same after that for me			1
' but the repeated abuse came to a head about a week ago , he says			2
way had temporarily moved out of their home because he ' just could no longer live in a constantly aggressive environment ' but had moved back in as his partner was staying with her mother			0
one night , he says the woman stumbled back to the house allegedly drunk and screamed for him to let her in			0
' my heart got the better of me and i opened the door , ' @entity2 writes in the piece			2
' when you started to get aggressive i told you i wanted to leave			0

when things began turning violent , and it was clear her screaming would bring the police , @entity2 says he pulled out his iphone and started video recording , ' so that whatever happened i knew at least somebody would believe my story			2
' ' as you repeatedly tried to grab at my phone i recorded you beating , kicking me and ripping at my genitals , by the time i had managed to barricade myself in the bedroom the police finally arrived , ' he writes			2
beatings : in one exchange , she allegedly told him ' i should of slapped u harder ... ' ' at this point i could have easily had you arrested , but given that i loved you so much i hid the bruises and cuts across my body from the police and told them you were just shouting at me			0
' according to @entity2 , the @entity3 police officers did believe his story , but only escorted his girlfriend out of the house that night			2

he says he eventually had to call one of his girlfriend 's friends to come get her so he could leave his own house			0
way told @entity21 that writing the article was ' tremendously difficult ' but he wanted to go public to help other men trapped in similarly violent relationships who may be worried or embarrassed to speak out			1

@entity2 claims she also used his fear of being a foreigner against him			1
' it 's scary being an immigrant in the @entity166 , i 've tried to avoid all issues with the police and she would use that against me constantly			0
she would say " if you do n't do as you say i 'm going to call the police and tell them you beat me or raped me			0
" ' in the end , it took the police getting involved to realize how bad things had got			0
' more than 30 men have got in touch with @entity2 since he shared his story , confessing to have experienced relationships where a woman used ' the perception of vulnerability to abuse and bully ' them			1
@entity2 says he 's also been overwhelmed with support from friends and family since opening up and hopes that his experience will help society accept that the man is not always the abuser			2
he adds in the article : ' i 'm a strong , successful man , i deal with bullies and super stressful situations everyday , i 'm not whining because some girl slapped me or trying to get back at her for doing so			2
' i just want society to realize that neither partner should be able to behave like this , somebody who you have let into your heart needs to behave in a responsible way with it regardless of sex			0
' way also insists his former partner is not a bad person , signing off his account , ' for my ex girlfriend : i still love you , and i always will , maybe over time you will change enough for us to be back together , but for now please just learn from our experience together			2
