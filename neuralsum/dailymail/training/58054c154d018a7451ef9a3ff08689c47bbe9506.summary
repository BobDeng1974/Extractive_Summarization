@entity0 and @entity1 , pictured , used a controversial tax - avoidance scheme to reduce the amount of inheritance tax they owed @entity6 was forced to defend his own tax affairs yesterday after being accused of benefiting from a controversial tax - avoidance scheme			1
the @entity10 leader has spent the week lambasting ‘ tax dodgers ’ in the wake of the @entity14 scandal , but he now faces questions over his own family ’s practices			1
mr @entity1 and his family used a ‘ deed of variation ’ to divide the ownership of the family home in @entity21			1
these legal documents – which change the terms of someone ’s will after they have died – are used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance			1
deeds of variation were described as ‘ tax abuse ’ by @entity34 when he was @entity36			1
last night , mr @entity1 was urged to ‘ come clean ’ and answer ‘ serious questions ’ over the deal , which could have potentially saved the @entity10 leader and his brother @entity40 thousands of pounds			1
both brothers deny any wrongdoing and say they have paid all the tax owed			0
but the row is a major embarrassment to @entity6 in a week in which he has attacked the conservatives over tax avoidance as the row over the @entity14 tax scandal deepened			1
at an event at his old school , @entity53 in @entity21 , mr @entity1 was forced to defend his own complex arrangements			2
asked if he thought it was ‘ dodgy to use what ’s called in the trade a deed of variation , to leave your house to your children that avoids tax ’ , the @entity10 leader said : ‘ the deed of variation issue is something directed at me personally , it ’s something that my mother did 20 years ago , that was a decision she made			1
‘ let me just say this : i paid tax as a result of that transaction , i ’ve avoided no tax in that			0
no doubt the @entity73 wants to smear mud today but frankly it ’s not going to work			0
the story has been written before and i have paid tax on that money			0
’ after the death of @entity81 in 1994 , his will was changed to make @entity0 , @entity40 and their mother @entity83 part - owners of the family home			1
it meant that , in the event of their mother ’s death , part of the estate would already be in the hands of her sons			2
this would mean inheritance tax would be levied on only 60 per cent of the value of the home , reducing the bill			2
in 1994 , mr @entity34 included the scheme among ‘ tax abuses ’ which he promised to stop if @entity10 was elected			2
the @entity1 brothers are believed to have used a ' deed of variation ' after the death of their father @entity105 in 1994 which would have reduced the level of tax payable in the event of their mother @entity83 's death conservative mp @entity110 said last night : ‘ @entity1 needs to come clean and publish this deed of variation			1
there are still a number of very serious questions he needs to answer about his own tax arrangements			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity6 is trying to stand on what he thinks is the moral high ground , but it looks increasingly swampy			0
one can only presume he entered into it on the advice of some accountants that this was the best thing to do			0
he needs to come clean on the reasons for that			0
’ the @entity125 ’ deal centres on a four - storey @entity127 terrace house in fashionable @entity128 , @entity21 – now thought to be worth about £ 2.4 million			0
when @entity81 died in 1994 aged 70 , he left ‘ most ’ of his estate , valued at £ 349,000 not including the house , to his wife			0
@entity83 , @entity0 and @entity40 agreed on a ‘ deed of variation ’ which transferred 40 per cent of the equity of the home to the sons , who were each given a 20 per cent share			1
it is understood @entity83 sought professional advice before doing so			2
accountants say this type of agreement is almost always drawn up to reduce a family ’s total death duty bill			2
they can be drawn up at any time up to two years after the death of the parent			0
this meant that when mrs @entity150 dies , a slice of the estate is already in the hands of her sons and thus inheritance tax would be levied on only 60 per cent of the value of the home , potentially saving the brothers thousands			2
the main reason for a deed of variation , according to a government website , is to ‘ reduce the amount of inheritance or capital gains tax payable ’			1
the @entity1 brothers may not have been party to the deed of variation , as rules state it must only be ‘ signed by all the people who would lose out because of it ’			1
under current rules , a deed of variation must contain a statement confirming if the signatories ‘ intend ’ it to impact on ‘ inheritance tax and / or capital gains tax ’			1
in the event , @entity1 later bought his brother ’s and mother ’s share of the property			1
@entity182 documents show he paid £ 800,000 in august 2004 and it became home for him , his wife @entity185 and their two sons			0
the property was reportedly independently valued to ensure @entity0 and @entity83 received a fair deal			1
it meant @entity6 would have received £ 200,000 for his 20 per cent share , on which he paid capital gains tax			0
@entity6 , left , photographed with his father @entity105 , right in @entity194 , @entity21 around 1989 a @entity10 spokesman : ‘ @entity0 paid 40 per cent of capital gains tax when the house was sold in 2004 - 5			1
it ca n’t be tax avoidance if no tax was avoided			2
’ the house is now being rented out following @entity1 ’s move to @entity201 in 2013			2
the average property value in the area is £ 2,121,591 , according to @entity204			0
five years ago , @entity6 had to insist he was not a tax dodger over his other properties – when it emerged his name was absent from the title deeds of his £ 1.6 million home			0
the @entity211 townhouse where the @entity10 leader lives with his wife and their sons was bought in 2009 solely by @entity216 when she was his girlfriend			0
analysts claimed he and miss @entity216 could have legitimately avoided tens of thousands of pounds in capital gains tax , thanks to being unmarried at the time , over the sale of their previous flats before moving in together			0
@entity223 , a tax partner at accountants @entity225 who specialises in high net worth individuals and families , said of deeds of variation : ‘ before 2007 they would have largely been used to reduce the tax bill … to make the will more tax efficient than it otherwise would have been			0
‘ you have to say that a deed of variation can be beneficial for tax purposes , but it does have a real economic effect on the family			1
it can have a tax advantage , but i have seen just as many cases to sort out family rows , so it serves two purposes equally			0

@entity1 family used a a tax - avoidance scheme follow their father 's death
the family home was split between @entity0 and @entity40 and their mother @entity83
they used a controversial tax *loophole* called a ' deed of variation '
