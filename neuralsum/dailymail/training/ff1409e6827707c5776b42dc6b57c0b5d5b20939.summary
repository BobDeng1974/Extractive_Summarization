by @entity1 reporter published : 12:23 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 17:25 est , 13 january 2014 @entity3 has put its biggest - selling pickup truck on a radical diet before launching it today - stripping more than 700lbs from it compared to previous versions			1
the f - 150 - one of which sold every 41 seconds during 2013 making a $ 7.6 billion profit in the @entity11 alone - is almost entirely made from lightweight aluminum			1
the redesign is an attempt to improve the trucks fuel economy after the @entity11 government ordered manufacturers to make cars and trucks with a combined 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025			1
the use of light alloys in 97 per cent of the construction is a revolutionary change for a vehicle known for its heft and an industry still heavily reliant on steel			1
the truck is @entity3 's response to small - business owners ' desire for a more fuel - efficient and nimble truck - and stricter government requirements on fuel economy			1
and it sprang from a challenge by @entity3 's ceo to move beyond the traditional design for a full - size pickup			1
unveiling : @entity46 vice president @entity45 introduces the new f - 150 pickup truck at the @entity23 at the @entity24 in @entity25 , today chief executive @entity48 said : ' you 're either moving ahead and you 're improving and you 're making it more valuable and more useful to the customer or you 're not			2
' @entity53 trucks - which include the @entity53 and heavier duty models like the @entity53 - have been the best - selling vehicles in the @entity11 for the last 32 years			1
but while the construction techniques and material are ground - breaking , the @entity53 still bears a striking resemblance to previous models which date bake to 1948			1
the key question for @entity3 , and the people who sell its trucks , is : will customers embrace such a radical change ? dealers who have seen the new @entity53 say they expect to encounter some skepticism , but the change had to be made			1
' we 're aggressive , stretching the envelope , ' said @entity72 , owner of four @entity3 dealerships in the @entity76 - @entity75 area			1
' i think you have to do that			0
if you do n't , then you get into that predicament of being a " me too " vehicle			0
' still , it 's a big risk			0
@entity3 makes an estimated $ 10,000 profit on every @entity53 truck it sells , making trucks a $ 7.6 billion profit center in the @entity11 alone last year			1
drawing a crowd : journalists surround the new @entity53 with a body built almost entirely out of aluminum at the @entity23 in @entity25 , today and the company has had some quality issues with recent vehicle launches , adding to dealers ' worries			1
the 2013 escape small @entity96 has been the subject of seven recalls			0
the 2015 @entity53 goes on sale late this year			1
while aluminum is more expensive that steel , @entity3 truck marketing chief @entity100 says the @entity53 will stay within the current price range			1
@entity53 trucks now range from a starting price of $ 24,445 for a base model to $ 50,405 for a top - of - the - line @entity106			1
it 's difficult to calculate how much more aluminum costs , since there are different grades of aluminum and steel			0
@entity113 , the @entity53 's chief engineer , said @entity3 expects to make up the premium by reducing its recycling costs , since there will be less metal to recycle , and by slimming down the engine and other components , since they wo n't have to move so much weight			1
launch : a @entity3 2015 f - 150 truck is seen outside the @entity124 in the @entity126 borough of @entity127 , today refinement : @entity3 has redesigned the @entity53 range under pressure from the government to improve their fuel efficiency aluminum was used on cars even before the first @entity53 went on sale in 1948			1
it 's widely used on sporty , low - volume cars now , like the @entity138 electric sedan and the @entity139			2
@entity141 trucks are also made of aluminum			2
@entity3 has spent decades researching the metal			2
twenty years ago , the company built a fleet of 20 all - aluminum experimental sedans			2
later , it used aluminum on exotic cars from @entity149 and @entity150 , brands it used to own			0
but up to now , @entity3 limited the aluminum on its trucks to the hoods and used steel for the rest			2
new government fuel economy requirements , which mandate that automakers ' cars and trucks get a combined 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 , are speeding the switch to aluminum			1
@entity165 's @entity164 is currently the most fuel - efficient pickup , getting 25 mpg on the highway			2
the current @entity53 gets as much as 23 mpg			0
@entity3 wo n't say what the new truck 's fuel economy will be , but says it will trump the competition			1
success story : @entity3 unveils the new f - 150 with a body built almost entirely out of aluminum which it hopes will win over a new legion of customers profit : 2009 @entity180 is part of the @entity53 range which has helped the company book considerable profits that could be an especially important incentive for landscapers , carpenters and other small business owners focused on their bottom line			1
' i think that 's going to outweigh the aluminum part of it , ' said @entity194 , a @entity3 dealer in @entity196 , @entity197 , who has n't yet seen the new truck			2
improvements in aluminum are also driving the change			0
three years ago , for example , @entity206 - one of @entity3 's suppliers for the @entity53 - figured out a way to pretreat aluminum so it would be more durable when parts are bonded together			1
changing with the times : the latest @entity53 still takes some of its styling from previous models , such as this 1980 @entity212 style : @entity3 sold an @entity53 truck every 41 seconds last year and has been producing the model for decades			1
pictured is a 1987 @entity212 carmakers can now use three or four rivets to piece together parts that would have needed 10 rivets before , @entity206 spokesman @entity217 said			0
and @entity3 is able to take more risks			0
when the @entity53 was last redesigned , in the mid- 2000s , @entity3 was losing billions each year and resources were spread thin			1
but by 2010 , when the company gave the green light to an all - aluminum truck , @entity3 was making money again			1
ceo @entity48 , a former @entity228 executive who joined @entity3 in 2006 , encouraged his team to think bigger			0
after all , it was @entity48 who led early development of @entity228 's @entity233 , which replaced aluminum with even lighter - weight plastics to be more efficient and fly further			0
' everything becomes more efficient once you take the weight out , ' @entity48 says			0
he expects aluminum to be used across @entity3 's model lineup in the future			2
in the genes : the @entity53 trucks have been one of @entity3 's most profitable models , including this 1967 @entity53 design classic : since being launched 66 years ago , @entity3 has redesigned the @entity53 pickup , of which a 1957 f - 100 model is pictured , 12 times @entity3 is convinced truck buyers will accept the change			1
the company says the new truck will tow more and haul more , since the engine does n't have to account for so much weight			2
it can also accelerate and stop more quickly			0
aluminum does n't rust , @entity3 says , and it 's more resistant to dents			0
@entity113 says the company planted prototype f - 150s with three companies - in mining , construction and power - for two years without revealing they were aluminum			2
the companies did n't notice a difference			0
@entity48 says @entity3 's customers have already shown a willingness to adopt new technology			0
forty percent of the @entity53 trucks sold last year had @entity3 's more efficient @entity273 engines , for example , which were introduced just three years ago			1
and @entity48 says owners trust @entity3			0
@entity3 will still have a tough time wresting customers from the competition , mainly @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity164 , says @entity281 , an independent auto industry consultant in @entity283			0
' movement between brands in the full - size truck segment is extremely minimal , ' @entity281 says			0
' it 's the strongest loyalty of any segment			0
' hit : the @entity53 trucks , a 1948 f - 1 model pictured , has been a hit with @entity11 customers since it was launched 66 years ago still , about 20 per cent of pickup buyers traditionally are open to jumping from brand to brand based on features or price , @entity281 said			1
the company with the newest , most advanced truck has the advantage in getting those customers , plus those who are new to the market , @entity281 says			0
some steel remains on the truck			0
the frame beneath it is built primarily of high - strength steel , which @entity3 says will make it tougher and stiffer than the current frame			2
there 's also steel in the front dashboard , because @entity3 thought steel was better at dampening nose from the engine			0
in all , a four - door @entity53 has 660 pounds of aluminum , or nearly double the average use of aluminum per vehicle used now , according to @entity320 , an aluminum industry web site			1
if the @entity3 truck is a success , use of aluminum could expand rapidly at the expense of steel			2
' people are beginning to truly understand the value that aluminum can bring to the table , ' @entity217 said			0
@entity3 is expecting some issues with the design or the manufacturing as it makes the change , @entity48 said			2
but the company is working hard to troubleshoot			0
' i think the attitude is , expect the unexpected and expect to deal with it , ' he says			0
' sometimes i think our core competency is scrambling			0
that 's not unique to @entity3			0

vehicle is 97 per cent made from the light weight metal

car company sold one @entity53 model every 41 seconds last year
