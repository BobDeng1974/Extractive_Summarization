dangerous : this lazy terrapin decided to catch a ride across a pond - on the back of a deadly alligator the father - of - two said : ' i was looking out on the pond and noticed this particular alligator with the red - eared terrapin on his back			2
he was swimming around the pond slowly and the turtle was simply hitching a ride			2
' then as they began to go under this branch , seen in the picture , the terrapin tried stretching to grab the piece of moss hanging down from the branch			1
i had my camera ready and was lucky enough to get this frame			2
he added : ' of course this is not normal behaviour for these two animals , but i think since they live in the same pond year round that they must have become very accustomed to each other and considered it no big deal to share the same space			0
' the earliest known turtles date from 220million years ago , making them one of the oldest reptile groups and even more ancient than lizards , snakes or crocodiles			0
there are two living alligator species : the @entity62 alligator and the @entity64 alligator			0
alligators first appeared about 37million years ago			0
large male alligators are solitary territorial animals while smaller alligators can often be found in large numbers close to each other .			0
