the manager of @entity3 ( yes , that 's really her team name ) scoops the second £ 1,000 weekly prize after a weekend performance inspired by @entity19 and @entity20 players which saw her earn a whopping 283 @entity6 points			1
like @entity0 , the winner on @entity23 , mrs @entity2 will now have to wait until the january transfer window before she can replenish her side after using all 16 transfers last weekend to secure the prize			1
@entity29 featured three different goalkeepers - @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 - over the weekend			1
and selecting @entity20 frontmen @entity35 and @entity36 up front on monday proved decisive			1
here , mrs @entity2 , who is 52 and supports @entity38 , explains her strategy : ' before i started playing towards the second week competition i looked at the entire round of fixtures			1
i made a prediction of all 10 games			0
prize pair : @entity35 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) starred for @entity20 in their 3 - 1 win over @entity48 ' i wanted to make sure i get at least 30 points from saturday excluding other bonuses ( such as goals , assists etc )			1
' i constructed a bench consisting of cheap players playing on sunday			2
i picked a @entity19 bench featuring @entity55 ( £ 5.5m ) as i knew that he will come as a sub and bring bonus points for a win			2
i had @entity59 as he was very cheap and also playing on sunday			0
' i played cheap bench so that i can accommodate players from @entity20 ( who are the most expensive in the game )			2
in other words , i was thinking about the final game on monday when i started building my team			0
' i predicted a comfortable win for @entity68 so i started with @entity68 's almost entire team and some other cheap players , such as @entity71 ( i expected @entity72 to win ) , @entity66 is in starting the @entity73 and @entity74 ( who paid off for his price with a goal ) , around them			2
' on sunday i focused @entity79 as @entity81 's record at @entity82 is poor and they have just recruited new defenders who need time to gel together			0
@entity84 have new coach while @entity87 - @entity86 was unpredictable and that is why i ignored these two fixtures			0
the winning formula : mrs @entity2 's winning side on monday after using all her 16 transfers ' as for monday , @entity48 did not play well in the game last week against @entity95 so i predicted @entity20 's win			1
having said that i accommodated nine @entity20 players in order to collect around 27 points only for a win			1
' check out mrs @entity2 's winning team ( above ) and remember , it 's not too late for you to enter a team and go for the £ 1,000 weekly prize - you have 36 more week 's to claim a prize ! all you have to do is be the top manager on one of the 38 @entity110 game weeks to be crowned a grand master			1
cumulative points over the season do not count towards the weekly prize			0
there 's £ 60,000 in total in this season 's prize fund , which includes a £ 10,000 top prize for the overall best manager			0
there 's also a £ 5,000 special prize for the chairman who manages the top - performing mini-league			0
it 's all to play for and it 's completely free to enter			0
so , what are you waiting for ? click here to start picking your fantasy team now ! @entity131 changes : @entity29 's three different line ups over the past weekend as 16 transfers were made			0
