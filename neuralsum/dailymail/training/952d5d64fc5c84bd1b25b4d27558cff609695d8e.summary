by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 09:58 est , 31 october 2012 @entity2 's owners had always found his puppy dog eyes impossible to resist			2
and as a result the lovable cocker spaniel was forever eating scraps from their plates , naughty treats and sweet snacks - as well as munching through four meals of actual dog food a day			1
but @entity12 and @entity13 from @entity14 , @entity15 , realised things had got out of hand when six - year - old @entity2 became so fat he could n't jump onto the sofa , and walking for just five minutes left him gasping for breath			1
supersize spaniel : @entity2 the cocker spaniel when he weighed over 23kg before his crash diet and new fitness regime gave him a new lease of life at 23.5kg ( 52lbs ) - and with the average weight of a healthy cocker spaniel being between six and 17kg ( 15 and 37lbs ) - @entity2 had been pampered into obesity			1
when @entity12 , 68 , noticed her beloved pet could no longer climb onto the sofa because of his growing bulge she enrolled him in a special pet fit club			2
and six months later @entity2 has shed 6.9kg ( 15lbs ) , now weighing in at a trim 16.6kg ( 36.5lbs ) and regularly breezes through four - mile walks			2
@entity12 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , said : ' @entity2 is a different dog			1
he runs all over the place , we walk him four times a day and he loves it			0
' before , he could n’t do anything , he could n't jump on the bed , or the sofa and after five minutes out walking he would be out of breath			0
he was like an old man of about 90			0
' we just did n't realise that giving in to his puppy dog eyes was so bad for his waistline			0
' fit as a fiddle : @entity50 nurse @entity49 checks @entity2 the cocker spaniel 's new svelte waistline following his six - month diet plan @entity2 was found wondering the streets in @entity55 , @entity14 , as an 11 - week - old puppy by a member of the public and handed into the police			1
he was taken in by @entity12 and @entity13 who spent five years feeding him an excessive diet of tinned dog food , supplemented with sweet snacks and treats from the dinner table			1
but last november @entity12 , a retired nursery worker , noticed a decline in @entity2 ’s health and enrolled him at a special fit club run by the @entity68 for @entity69 at @entity70 hospital			1
proud owners : @entity13 and @entity72 with slimming @entity2 the dieting spaniel big fella : ' before , he couldn ¿ t do anything , he could n't jump on the bed , or the sofa and after five minutes out walking he would be out of breath - he was like an old man of about 90 ' vets weighed the unfit pooch and were astonished to find that @entity2 was 34 per cent heavier than the recommended weight for a dog of his size and breed			1
@entity12 , a grandmother of six , said : ' @entity2 would get everything - left - overs , treats or a piece of cake on someone 's birthday			1
he could eat all day			0
' we loved him to bits but we did n't realise what damage we were doing			0
' @entity2 was put on a special diet of dried dog food and after just four mouths weighed 18kg ( 39.6lbs )			2
he went on to lose more weight and is now fitter than ever			0
puppy love : @entity2 the super-slimming dog as a rescue puppy , when he was taken in by @entity12 and @entity103 @entity12 added : ' the @entity50 have done wonders with him			1
getting @entity2 to stick to the diet was something of a challenge at the start as human food had become a much loved part of his life			0
' but now he 's a new dog			0
he really is marvellous and great with the grandkids			0
we walk him four times a day and then on a weekend we do about four miles around the park			0
' @entity2 runs around without getting out of breath and is generally happier in everything he does			0
' @entity119 , senior vet at @entity120 hospital , said : ' this is a great success story for all concerned , and @entity12 has clearly done a wonderful job in managing @entity2 ’s food intake and safely increasing his activity levels			1
' @entity125 : @entity2 before his diet , during which his owners were taught that dogs should stick to food that is designed for them , not for humans handsome boy : finally @entity2 , pictured with owners @entity13 and @entity72 , is able to enjoy running about like his canine companions			2
