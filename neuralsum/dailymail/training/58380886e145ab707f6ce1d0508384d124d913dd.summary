by @entity0 freed from the pressure of maintaining a remarkable podium streak , @entity1 has vowed to take the race to brother @entity5 in thursday ’s triathlon			1
between 2010 and may 2014 , the 24 - year - old finished in the top three in every race , winning @entity11 bronze and the world title in 2012			1
but in back - to - back @entity14 races in @entity16 and @entity17 , he could finish only fifth			1
@entity24 , left , won bronze and @entity5 gold chasing @entity27 : @entity24 finished third in @entity28 , while his brother @entity5 won the event it was a blow but also a blessing			1
@entity1 goes into the @entity33 on the back of finishing third in @entity28 earlier this month and he is ready to throw everything into trying to beat @entity11 champion @entity5			1
‘ in a way , i quite like not having a podium streak , because it was playing on my mind , ’ he said			0
‘ it was a lot of pressure			0
i stood on the start - line and there were lots of other people who did n’t have anything to lose , whereas i had a podium streak to lose			2
’ @entity1 started the season in decent form but was well beaten by @entity50 rival @entity49 in both @entity51 and @entity52 , before the two fifth - place finishes left him questioning everything in his training and preparation			2
siblings : @entity5 , left , won the @entity14 round in @entity28 , with @entity24 , right , third ‘ i think i over-trained a little bit in the winter and then lacked that real top - end training , ’ he said			1
‘ not having @entity5 training with me definitely affected that			0
’ @entity5 was recovering from his now customary early - season injury problems but , as usual , the older sibling appears to have timed things right , winning the @entity68 and the race in @entity28			2
‘ @entity5 ’s very fit , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ this course definitely suits him			0
it ’s a very hard bike and it suits his aggressive racing , but i ’ll try my best			0
‘ in training we ’ve been very similar so all i can do is try — again			0
’ @entity74 ready for 2014 @entity19			0

@entity1 recently finished outside podium places in @entity16 and @entity17 - having come in top three in every race between 2010 and may 2014
with the pressure of keeping that streak going off , he is intent on pushing his brother all the way on thursday
@entity1 won bronze at @entity86 when @entity5 took home the gold medal
