are you better off than you were five years ago ? this will be one of the central questions of the general election			0
@entity6 politicians on both sides hope to recreate the powerful attack that @entity9 famously launched against @entity10 in the 1980 us presidential election , when he asked if voters if they felt their incomes had improved over four years			2
@entity14 yesterday boasted that this year families will be £ 900 better off than in 2010 , while @entity16 claims workers are £ 1,600 worse off			1
the @entity32 ' focus on real household disposable income takes into account the effect of tax and benefit changes , and suggests incomes overtaking 2010 levels by the end of 2015 chancellor @entity14 argues that families will be better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 one of the big surprises of the budget yesterday was @entity14 's announcement that incomes this year would be higher in real terms than in 2010			1
after years of austerity and slow growth , many @entity32 had given up hope being able to go into the election with voters feeling the benefits of the recovery			1
the chancellor told @entity55 : ' to the question of whether people are better off at the end of this @entity60 than they were five years ago we can give the resounding answer ' yes '			0
' you can measure it by gdp per capita , and the answer is yes – up by 5 per cent			0
' or you can use the most up - to - date and comprehensive measure of living standards which is @entity68			2
' in other words , how much money families have to spend after inflation and tax			2
' it is the living standards measure used by the @entity76 and by the @entity77			0
' on that measure i can confirm , on the latest @entity81 data today , living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010			2
' and it confirms they are set to grow strongly every year for the rest of the decade			0
' the @entity6 people for years paid the heavy price of the great recession			0
' now , the facts show households on average will be around £ 900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 – and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis anymore , but is instead growing and creating jobs			1
' @entity16 's @entity98 claims wages are worth £ 1,600 less in real terms than they were in 2010 @entity16 has long argued that wages outstripped by inflation have left workers feeling poorer			1
they argue that average weekly earnings have fallen in real terms from £ 453 in 2010 to £ 418 in april 2014			1
the attack is based on the claim that austerity choked off the recovery in 2010 , leaving employers unable to give pay rises			1
each year that prices rose faster than wages , workers saw that they cash did not go as far each month as it used to			1
in the @entity116 today , @entity98 declared : ' for all the chancellor 's hubris , yesterday 's @entity117 has changed nothing for working people in our country			1
' the chancellor spent an hour telling people they have never had it so good but working people are still gbp1 , 600 a year worse off on average after five years of the @entity32			1
' ' even on his own measure , people are worse off than they were in 2010			2
' this is the first @entity60 since the early 1920s when the average person in work will be worse - off at the end of a parliament than they were at the beginning			0
' the fact is in answer to the famous @entity9 question - ' are you better off than you were five years ago ? ' the answer is a resounding no. ' they both are			0
much of the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the @entity32 and @entity16 are using different figures and different time scales			0
@entity14 used @entity68 , which is the amount of money a family has after tax and benefit changes take effect			1
figures published by the @entity81 show that @entity68 is lower than in 2010 in every year until the end of 2015 , before rising annually towards 2019			1
technically it means that incomes will not be above 2010 levels until the end of this year , not before the election			1
@entity98 uses gross weekly earnings , which is the amount workers are paid before tax and benefit changes take effect			1
@entity16 's figures also only cover the period up to april 2014 , compared to mr @entity14 's date at the end of 2015			1
@entity170 , director of the @entity171 , said : ' average household incomes have just about regained their pre-recession levels			1
they are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010 , and possibly higher than their 2009 peak			2
' but that still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history			2
having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration			2
' as ever there is much truth in both numbers			0
real earnings have fallen , as mr @entity191 says			0
real incomes should be above their 2010 level as mr @entity14 says			1
' we are for sure much worse off on average than we could reasonably have expected to be back in 2007 or indeed back in 2010			0
' whether or not voters feel they are better off - and crucially will get better off in the future - will be key to deciding who is in @entity199 after the election when voters go to the polls in 49 days , both sides will keep repeating their claims			0
neither of which will reflect the true state of family finances on may 7			0
@entity16 is still looking back a year , while the @entity32 are looking ahead seven months , based on a forecast			0
in truth , most people do not really know if they are actually better off than they were five years ago , when inflation , tax and benefits are taken into account			0
being told you 're better off will alienate those who are struggling , but after years of austerity voters also want a bit of optimism			0
even if they do not yet feel like the good times are back , they will want to believe @entity14 when he says : ' the sun is starting to shine			2
' and for the first time in five years he has some figures to prove it .			0

@entity14 claimed in @entity117 that families will be better off in 2015
figures are based on @entity68 after tax
@entity98 says workers were £ 1,600 worse off in april 2014 than in 2010
real terms fall caused by prices rising faster than wages for years
but a year on , with the economy growing , wages are now starting to rise
@entity171 says such a slow recovery in incomes is no cause for celebration
