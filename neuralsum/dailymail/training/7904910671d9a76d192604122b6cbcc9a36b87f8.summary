industry chiefs insist the bill for converting parking meters , vending machines and phone boxes to accept the new £ 1 coin could be more than £ 200million			1
the 12 - sided coin , which resembles a classic threepenny bit , was announced as a way to fight a surge in the number of £ 1 in circulation - a racket that costs the economy some £ 45million a year			1
but roughly 1.2million machines on the market will have to be re-calibrated to fit the new piece , which is set to be introduced in 2017 , according to one industry expert			1
and the government will embed luminescent particles that will show up under a particular light - making fakes easier to spot upgrade : payphones , parking metres , betting shop fruit machines , launderette washing machines and supermarket self - service check - outs are among the roughly £ 1.2million machines that will need to be re-fitted payphones , parking metres , betting shop fruit machines , launderette washing machines and supermarket trolleys are among the devices that will need to be upgraded			1
earlier this year , the @entity38 suggested that the cost of converting these machines would be around £ 20million			1
but company chiefs have today disputed the amount - calculating that it could me more than five times as much			2
@entity45 , ceo of the @entity46 , estimated that forgeries make up some 3.03 per cent of the more than 1.5billion £ 1 coins in circulation			2
he said that increasingly sophisticated technology meant that coins were easier to fake - and that 50 per cent of these counterfeit coins successfully passed through vending machines			2
the new coin will be made from two types of metal , like the current £ 2 coin			2
out with the old : the present £ 1 coin , left , will be replaced to allay concerns about counterfeiting			2
its replacement will be a reworking of the old - fashioned threepenny bit , which last circulated in 1971 and the government will imbed tiny luminescent particles in the coin that will show up under a particular light - making fakes easier to spot			2
mr @entity45 said that , while the @entity46 agrees with the principle of introducing a new £ 1 coin , it also believes that the government needs to do more to cover the cost of converting the machines			1
he told @entity75 that it will cost £ 72.8million to adapt 450,000 coffee , snack and drink machines across the country			1
he added : ' we need a categorical assurance that there will be no upgrade of the 20p or 50p coins in the forseeable future ' , explaining that the move would lead to crippling costs for some			0
costly : earlier this year , it was estimated that the cost of re-calibrating each parking machine is £ 500 a time , which means converting every one across the @entity92 would add up to £ 50million @entity93 , the body that represents the amusement industry , said that it will cost £ 100million to adapt 350,000 gaming machines			1
chief executive @entity97 said : ' this cost can not be passed on to customers because of strict rules governing the relationship between stakes and winnings			0
' the industry is faced with a number of challenges already and our members , many of whom are small independent businesses , can not afford this additional cost			0
' earlier this year , it was estimated that the cost of re-calibrating each parking machine is £ 500 a time , which means converting every one across the @entity92 would add up to £ 50million			1
the @entity115 , whose members run car parks and on - street parking machines for councils and private firms estimated that the bills will be much higher			1
the @entity115 has estimated that about 80,000 parking machines - 10,000 of which dispense change			1
in a statement it said : ' it is estimated that the simplest software upgrade on a pay and display machine will cost in the region of £ 90 to £ 130 per machine			1
if the validator requires changing , this can often also require new fixing brackets for the new validator and would cost in the region of £ 250 to £ 350 per machine			0
' on machines providing change , it will be considerably more			0
' however , the association said that one benefit of the change will be to stop around 40million counterfeit coins going in to parking machines each year , which would offset the cost			1
the @entity145 told @entity75 today that it was working with the @entity38 and the @entity146 on the project to ensure that there was a ' fair and sufficient implementation period '			0
a spokesman said that self - service check - outs , tills and weighting machines in the back office were among those that would need an upgrade			0
but he said that it was difficult to estimate a final total cost without receiving the final specifications			0
a spokesman for the @entity146 said : ' after thirty year ’s loyal service , the time is right to replace the current £ 1 coin with a new , more secure coin that will reduce the costs of counterfeiting to our economy			2
' it is the small and medium businesses that feel the costs the most and ultimately , the costs of bringing in the new coin could never compare to the price we ’d pay in the event that confidence in the £ 1 coin deteriorated			0
' that ’s why the government is acting now , to stay several steps ahead of the counterfeiters			0
in doing that , we are committed to arriving at a final specification of the coin that maximises the benefits to the @entity92 and to introducing the new coin in a manageable way for industry			0
' that is why we have been undertaking a full consultation with all interested parties , which will determine the final specification of the coin			0
' in september , @entity194 launched a competition for members of the public to design what goes on the tails of the new 12 - sided £ 1 coin			1
this unique opportunity will put a design on millions of new £ 1 coins while the winner will receive a £ 10,000 fee in exchange for the right to use it			0
but the contest , which is now closed , sparked the creation of a number of spoof coins - with pranksters posting designs using mr @entity214 , @entity215 and the @entity216 to @entity217			0
voldermort : one designer thought that the evil @entity221 character would be perfect on the new coin source : @entity224			0

the 12 - sided coin will be introduced in 2017 to tackle surge in counterfeits
roughly 1.2million machines on the market will have to be re-calibrated
@entity38 estimated this year that this would cost around £ 20million
but industry experts said it could be more than five times as much
