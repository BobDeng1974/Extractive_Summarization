by @entity0 published : 13:12 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 13:46 est , 11 february 2013 the debate over @entity3 's future within the @entity4 entered a new phase today , with the publication of two major reports about the impact of independence			1
economic experts at the @entity11 - set up by @entity3 first minister @entity12 - argued that keeping the pound in the event of a yes vote in 2014 would be both ' sensible ' and an attractive choice for the rest of the @entity4			1
the group was established to provide advice on the economic challenges and opportunities the country would face after independence			0
its first report , published by the @entity24 , stated : ' on day one of independence , the members of the @entity26 agree that retaining sterling would be a sensible currency choice that would be attractive both to @entity3 and the @entity4			1
' economic experts at the @entity11 argued that keeping the pound in the event of a yes vote in 2014 would be an attractive choice for the rest of the @entity4			1
@entity32 , @entity33 and @entity3 's first minister @entity12 , sign a referendum agreement during a meeting in @entity37 last october but @entity38 , the chair of the @entity11 , said more talks were needed , as ' nobody has agreed to anything yet '			1
meanwhile , a report by legal experts at @entity45 - made public at the same time as @entity11 's - warned @entity3 would not continue to hold the same rights and powers in the event of independence			1
the @entity50 published work by @entity52 , @entity53 at the @entity54 , and @entity55 , professor of public international law at the @entity57			0
they argued the most likely outcome of a vote for independence would be the rest of the @entity4 would retain its current international status , while a new state of @entity3 would also be created			2
the @entity24 's claim that @entity3 would remain a member of existing international organisations such as the @entity66 , the @entity67 and , crucially , the @entity68 ' can be dismissed as , at best , inconclusive ' , according to the expert analysis			1
@entity3 secretary @entity70 also said that , while an independent @entity3 would not inherit the @entity4 's existing rights under international treaties , it would inherit a share of the @entity4 national debt			1
' we would need to have an equitable distribution of the liabilities , ' the @entity4 government minister stated			0
@entity11 was established by @entity12 ( above ) to provide advice on the economic challenges and opportunities the country would face after independence mr @entity70 stressed : ' personally , i think the best deal for @entity3 is that we stay in the @entity4 , and therefore i will be arguing very strongly for that in the next 18 months			1
' @entity3 deputy first minister @entity88 declared the @entity4 @entity24 's position was ' hugely arrogant '			1
she added : ' a legal opinion is just that - there are opinions from other legal experts that say the opposite that @entity3 would be a co-equal successor state			0
international law is not settled - the reality is these matters would be settled by negotiations			0
' in its report the @entity11 - which includes @entity102 - winning economists professor @entity100 and professor sir @entity104 - concluded independence would ' provide @entity3 with the opportunity to capture and deliver faster sustainable economic growth '			2
mr @entity38 also insisted : ' @entity3 has the clear potential to be a successful independent nation			0
' @entity112 deputy leader @entity111 welcomed ' this new phase in the debate about @entity3 's future as we move from assertion and spin to evidence and fact '			2
he added : ' the analysis produced by the @entity50 highlights the strong ties that bind @entity3 to the @entity4 and the positive ways in which we work together in the interests of all the people of these islands			2
it makes it clear that severing these links and going it alone would be a bad deal for @entity3			0
' the publication of both these reports brings a real focus to the stark choice that face the people of @entity3			0
' @entity3 @entity138 leader @entity137 said the @entity50 report ' shatters the myth peddled by @entity12 that independence would be a smooth process without any major upheaval for the people of @entity3 '			0
she claimed : ' the onus is now on the @entity145 and others wanting to take @entity3 out of the @entity4 to set out the evidence and facts to support their position			2
' meanwhile @entity152 leader @entity151 said the export economists ' could n't make the @entity155 sums add up '			0
he hit out : ' between @entity158 's promise that there would be no increases in personal tax and the @entity145 's suggestion that they will spend billions of pounds more on public services , it does n't take a @entity102 winning economist to note there is a substantial black hole in the @entity145 's independence economic plans			0

report by @entity11 , set up by @entity3 first minister
*separate* study by @entity45 *lawyers* : @entity3 remaining member of @entity66 , @entity68 and @entity67 after yes vote ' can be dismissed as , at best , inconclusive '
