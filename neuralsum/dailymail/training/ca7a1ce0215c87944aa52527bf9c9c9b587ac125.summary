warm and nurturing : @entity0 is wonderful , and i want her to continue for ever do we really want more ancient women on tv ? and if so , perhaps we should examine why exactly ? my feeling is that people of both sexes over the age of 60 should be doing different things			1
@entity10 gets more irascible as time goes on , while sir @entity13 's show on @entity14 is positively painful to watch – i have to study him closely because i 'm afraid that he has stopped breathing			2
as with most things , it depends on how long the person in question can keep going in their career			2
@entity0 is wonderful , and i want her to continue for ever			1
but with their loud cries for comebacks , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , who surely landed their tv careers due to their good looks ( and , in the case of @entity25 , great legs ) , remind me why this particular sort of older woman is a turn - off			1
@entity34 is warm , nurturing and , occasionally , slightly stern , while women such as @entity26 want to continue asking probing , important questions , which , once you are post-menopausal , turns you into a mad , impatient and slightly batty combatant			1
i know this because this is what i 'm like : i fly off the handle , i moan , i have no patience with men or with younger women , and i am intolerant to the point of wanting to punch staff in @entity48 's who ask me if i have a @entity51 card			1
i nearly had a fight the other day with a young male waiter who asked me to move along one stool at the bar of a swanky restaurant because that would allow another couple to sit down			2
comebacks : @entity25 , left , and @entity26 , right , remind me why this sort of older woman is a turn - off an older man would have said ' ok , old chap ' and not turned a hair ( if he still had hair , that is )			1
but an older woman immediately thinks this is a personal attack on the fact she does n't have a husband , and is not attractive enough to act as a siren to passing trade			1
so we become unreasonable , which is ok if you are making cupcakes , but not if you are addressing @entity76			2
prickly is n't good either – even @entity77 dusts his dourness with flashes of wry humour			2
take @entity81 , up against the good people of @entity83 on tv last week			1
when she found she was unwelcome , she was nearly in tears , forgetting that for most of the time she is a patronising bossy - boots			0
or take @entity89 presenter @entity88 , who peers over her spectacles as you take your seat opposite her in the studio , with barely a smiled hello – an effect that is terrifying when you are a guest			0
she comes across as a woman with a short fuse , only sympathetic when it comes to cancer or abuse victims , which is when you feel , as a listener , you are being licked by a labrador			1
women who ask difficult questions have to do so with a sort of oleaginous charm ( as practised by the doe - eyed @entity108 ) , but that 's a tad more difficult to pull off when you are a mere desiccated husk			1
so , really , what we as a nation have a stomach for is sweet old ladies only , and women who have kept their looks , such as @entity119			1
it seems they have to be in kitchen settings , too			0
and i suppose my final point is that looks do matter – or at least grooming			0
i would listen far more closely to what @entity126 has to say if only she could find her comb			0
i admire @entity0 and @entity129 for their hard work and intelligence , but also for the fact they are soignee			1
neither is a great beauty , but both show me they are where they are due to perseverance and modesty			0
two great qualities , at any age			0
@entity144 it seems for animal - lovers sorely disappointed by @entity146 ( not by one centimetre did he increase the size of a battery hen 's cage ) and @entity150 ( his manifesto was the most animal - friendly of all , which is why i voted for him , but he has backtracked wildly ) , that @entity154 might be the way forward			0
in response to a letter asking for his party 's stance on animal welfare , an adviser to @entity163 , @entity154 's spokesman on agriculture and welfare , sent this : ' the intention is to oppose live animal exports			0
' we are concerned that , as the @entity172 expands , many of the countries joining have little or no interest in animal welfare and they will have a growing interest over @entity172 policy on this subject			0
bad hair day : i would listen far more closely to what @entity126 has to say if she could only find a comb ' we have seen this indifference to animal welfare crop up in regard to the @entity172 's ban on battery cages and on sow stalls and tethers			0
' many countries have been very slow to react despite long periods of warning			0
rest assured , mr @entity163 will continue to speak out on these issues			2
' they 've got my vote .			0

do we want more ancient women on tv ? if so we should examine why ?
@entity0 is warm and wonderful and i want her to continue for ever
@entity26 reminds me why this sort of older woman is a turn off
