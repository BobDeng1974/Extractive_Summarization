by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam click here for all facts , stats and graphics from the the @entity6 at the end of a week in which @entity9 questioned @entity12 ’s continued absence from the @entity6 , two @entity7 gave @entity13 their third win in three and another proved his sublime traits do n’t always come saddled with the ridiculous			1
for this was not just about @entity19 ’s numerous mistakes and three well - taken goals from @entity21 and @entity22 , the first of which came inside two minutes and the second was quite brilliant			1
this was also about @entity26 , so dynamic in his bursts from deep positions , but all too often a victim of his seemingly insatiable desire to over-complicate @entity31 weekend , against @entity32 , he followed a 50 - yard pass with a simpler one straight into touch			1
here , he got the balance right			0

if that caveat leaves too much room for doubt , @entity12 could at least justify the mileage by watching the two @entity117 wingers who tore @entity19 apart			1
@entity118 , the best of the lot , is injured for the next three weeks			0
a modicum of perspective ought to be given to how poor @entity19 played			1
winless in three with two draws , this was often poor , occasionally inept			0
for each goal , they could have done so much better			0
the first can be chalked to bad luck , such was the calamity of timing that led @entity88 to slip at precisely the wrong moment			0
@entity77 and @entity21 had exchanged passes before the latter played in @entity75 , who backheeled the ball ahead of @entity21			1
@entity88 had a decent headstart and was shepherding the ball towards @entity41 but then he slipped			0
@entity21 went through , rounded @entity41 and scored his second goal in successive @entity49 games			1
@entity21 is one of the players @entity138 is known to think should have drawn attention from @entity141 ’s manager			1
his goal 22 minutes later owed more to technical brilliance than good fortune , but once more @entity19 did little to help themselves			2
they were placed under far too much pressure by a careless pass from @entity95 , who was stationed in his own area and rolled the ball straight to @entity75			0
@entity75 ’s cross was met by @entity87 but his weak header went straight to @entity22 on the edge of the area			2
the ball bounced high but the execution of @entity22 ’s half volley was perfect , the goal stunning			2
enough mistakes ? evidently not			0
bang : @entity22 unleashes a vicious shot that finds its way towards the top - right corner of the goal and cements @entity13 's lead over @entity19 incredible : @entity22 's 24th - minute goal sailed past @entity19 goalkeeper @entity41 and doubled the home side 's advantage on saturday afternoon unbelievable : @entity22 turns in celebration alongside @entity77 after scoring his brilliant half - volleyed strike to give @entity13 a 2 - 0 lead congrats : @entity77 approaches @entity22 after the 29 - year - old scored a goal to remember against @entity19 at the @entity6 on saturday afternoon @entity22 doubled @entity13 's lead with an incredible strike			1
click here for @entity60 's brilliant match zone how it happened : @entity22 's strike was full of technique and gave @entity13 a 2 - 0 lead after just 24 minutes against a poor @entity19 outfit mins @entity182 @entity13 total 107.8 67.0 @entity75 90 11.9 7.4 @entity73 90 11.6 7.2 @entity69 90 10.7 6.6 @entity19 total 106.2 66.0 @entity93 90 10.8 6.7 @entity94 90 10.8 6.7 @entity97 90 10.4 6.5 data courtesy of the @entity184 , the @entity185 of the @entity49 @entity88 headed against his own crossbar after 31 minutes and it was a further nine before they had a meaningful chance , @entity97 shotting straight at @entity68			1
even without the problems of a weak defence , the touches were sloppy , the attacks predictable			0
had @entity22 ’s next half volley , arguably an even better strike than the first , gone into the top corner after 43 minutes , it would have been game over			1
he looked annoyed to have missed but he need not have been			0
@entity19 had nothing to offer			2
when @entity97 shot in the 69th minute , it went out for a throw - in			2
by then @entity19 were lucky to have avoided a penalty when @entity202 handled a shot from @entity77 on the line			2
it was only a temporary escape			0
with 19 minutes still to play , @entity21 put the boot in			2
@entity69 found @entity75 and he created his third of the afternoon with a perfect pass for @entity21			0
the winger went through , no marker close enough , and slid a low shot past @entity41			0
the @entity212 is a long road and @entity13 sits near the end of it			0
it ’s surely worth a trip for @entity12 at some point			0
excellent : @entity26 deserves higher consideration when playing in an attacking role as he did against @entity19 , but will @entity141 manager @entity12 take note ? fiery : @entity19 's @entity93 and @entity13 's @entity75 square up during the intense clash between the two @entity49 sides strike : @entity21 bags his brace against @entity19 in the home tie with a shot in the 71st minute to make it 3 - 0 to @entity13 two : @entity21 reminds the crowd how many he 's scored during the well - earned victory for @entity13 on saturday as they emerge with three important points			1

two goals from @entity21 in the second and 71st minute earn @entity13 *emphatic* win over @entity19
incredible strike from @entity22 doubled @entity13 's advantage at @entity6 as home side win 3 - 0
two *englishmen* help @entity9 win third match after @entity49 victories over @entity32 and @entity244
excellent @entity26 performance *reiterates* @entity138 's calls for @entity141 manager @entity12 to notice @entity249 stars
