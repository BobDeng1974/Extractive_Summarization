close to the ear : cancer scientists want a full investigation into the risks of using a mobile a scientific conference starting in @entity6 today will urge governments across the world to support independent research into the possibility that using mobile phones encourages the growth of head cancers			1
the children with @entity16 conference will highlight figures just published by the @entity18 , which show a 50 per cent increase in frontal and temporal lobe tumours between 1999 and 2009			1
the @entity18 figures show that the incident rate has risen from two to three per 100,000 people since 1999 , while figures from @entity25 show a one to two per cent annual increase in brain cancers in children			1
scientists and academics have long argued over the suggestion that radiation from mobile phones causes cancers			1
those who believe there is a link say that - with five billion mobile phones being used worldwide - urgent research must be carried out to establish the risk			1
while governments , phone companies , and health agencies give precautionary advice about minimising mobile phone use , the @entity41 is likely to conclude in a report due on thursday that the only established risk when using a mobile is crashing a car due to being distracted by a call or text			1
professor @entity53 , emeritus professor of human radiation effects at @entity55 , is opening the three - day conference in @entity57 today			2
he has previously advocated cigarette - style warnings on mobile phone packets and urges more independent research			1
professor @entity53 said : ' vast numbers of people are using mobile phones and they could be a time bomb of health problems - not just brain tumours , but also fertility , which would be a serious public health issue			1
' the health effects of smoking alcohol and air pollution are well known and well talked about , and it 's entirely reasonable we should be openly discussing the evidence for this , but it is not happening			0
' we want to close the door before the horse has bolted			0
' keeping track : there has been an increase in the number of child brain cancer sufferers , and the @entity18 has also spotted a rise in brain tumours the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) rang alarm bells last year when it classified mobile phones as ' possibly carginogenic '			1
professor @entity90 , of the @entity91 in @entity92 , said : ' for the first time a very prominent evaluation report states it so openly and clearly : @entity97 - @entity96 [ radio frequency electromagnetic field ] is possibly carcinogenic to humans			2
speaker dr @entity104 , from the epidemiology for @entity103 unit at @entity25 , will highlight the one to two per cent annual increase in brain cancers in children			1
she has concerns over the effect of radiation on children 's brains			0
she said : ' if the penetration of the electromagnetic waves goes for four centimetres into the brain , four centimetres into the adult brain is just the temporal lobe			2
' there are not too many important functions in the temporal lobe - but in a child the more central brain structures are going to be exposed			2
' in addition kids have a skull which is thinner , less protective , they have a higher content of water in the brain , so there are many reasons that they absorb more of the same radiation			2
' speaking to the @entity133 about the rise in brain cancer in children , she said : ' it ’s not age , it ’s too fast to be genetic , and it is n’t all down to lifestyle , so what in the environment can it be ? '' we now live in an electro - smog and people are exposed to wireless devices that we have shown in the lab to have a biological impact			1
' it is totally unethical that experimental studies are not being done very fast , in big numbers , by independently funded scientists			2
' the industry is just doing their job , i am more preoccupied with the so called independent scientists and institutions saying there is no problem			2
' ' one has to remember that @entity87 monographs are considered as " gold standard " in evaluation of carcinogenicity of physical and chemical agents			0
' if @entity87 says it so clearly then there must be sufficient scientific reason for it , or @entity87 would not put its reputation behind such claim			0
' however not everyone believes there is a significant risk from mobile phone radiation			1
@entity173 , professor of bio-engineering at the @entity175 , downplayed the @entity87 's classification			0
he is quoted on @entity177 as saying : ' saying that something is a " possible carcinogen " is a bit like saying that someone is a " possible shoplifter " because he was in the store when the watch was stolen			0
' the real question is what is the evidence that cell phones actually cause cancer , and the answer is - none that would persuade a health agency			2
' the @entity133 said the research is split almost 50:50 on whether mobile phones pose a health hazard or not , but pointed out research from @entity196 , director of the @entity197 and @entity198 at the @entity199 , who said that the balance changes if funding sources are considered , with around three quarters of studies implying no health risks being funded by the mobile phone industry			1
he told the paper : ' the mantra that " we need more research " is true , but there is already enough evidence to warrant better safety information , tighter regulation , mass public education and independently funded research carried out by teams of specialists who are not beholden to industry			0
conflicting views : ' this is the largest technological experiment in the history of our species and we ’re trying to bury our head in sand about the potential risks - risk we still know next to nothing about			1
' - @entity196 , @entity199 ' even if the risk is still only one in a million , with 5 billion phone users it means a lot of extra brain cancers			1
' - professor @entity53 ' saying that something is a " possible carcinogen " is a bit like saying that someone is a " possible shoplifter " because he was in the store when the watch was stolen			0
' - professor @entity173 ' this is the largest technological experiment in the history of our species and we ’re trying to bury our head in sand about the potential risks to cells , organs , reproduction , the immune system , behaviour , risks we still know next to nothing about			1
' governments and mobile phone companies often play down the risks and the @entity259 's @entity258 says there is ' no credible evidence of adverse health effects '			1
the @entity263 says : ' as a precaution children should only use mobile phones for essential purposes and keep all calls short			0
we keep all scientific evidence under review			0
' the @entity270 also advises children under 16 to minimise their use of mobile phones			0
the @entity274 , @entity275 's smartphone which popularised mobile computing , comes with the advice that you should keep your phone at least 15mm away from your body at all times - which may come as a surprise to those who keep the phone in their pockets at all times			1
the guide that comes with the phone warns : ' when using the @entity274 near your body for voice calls or wireless data transmissions over a cellular network , keep it at least 15mm away from the body , and only use carrying cases , belt clips or holders that do not have metal parts and that maintain at least 15mm separation between @entity274 and the body			0
' other guides , such as the one that comes with a @entity302 , have similar warnings			0
the @entity302 guide suggests that users , particularly pregnant women and teenagers , keep their phone 25mm from their body			0
a study held in @entity310 last october compared medical records against phone records of around 358,000 people			0
they correlated the data to see how long people owned their phones , and how many of these people developed brain cancer			1
some users had owned mobile phones for more than 20 years			0
in total , the group had owned their phones for ' 3.8 million years ' , and suffered 10,729 cases of tumours			0
when compared to the average population , they found no indication of ' dose - response ' relation either by years since first subscription for a mobile phone or by anatomical location of the tumour - that is , in regions of the brain closest to where the handset is usually held to the head			1
they concluded ' there were no increased risks of tumours of the central nervous system , providing little evidence for a causal association '			0
even the @entity274 manual states that people should keep their phone away from close body contact the guide , almost ironically , also suggest that users ' reduce the amount of time spent on calls '			0
professor @entity90 will use the conference to urge for a stronger @entity87 classification - ' probably carginogenic '			2
he told the @entity133 : ' since 2001 i have continuously spoken about the need for precautionary measures , especially for children			0
we have had enough evidence to call for that for a long time			0
' the conference will also discuss other reasons for childhood cancer , such as chemical toxins in the air , food and water , and infection and genetic effects			2
but the main message coming from the @entity378 conference is : more independent research is needed			1
professor @entity53 told the @entity133 : ' the public have a right to know this information			0
' we can not and do not say there is a causal link between brain cancer and mobile phones , but we are right to consider them as one possible explanation for the increase and the public have the right to expect that this is properly investigated			1
' even if the risk is still only one in a million , with 5 billion phone users , it means a lot of extra brain cancers			2

scientists at @entity6 conference call for independent research into potential links between using a mobile phone and brain cancer
figures from @entity18 show 50 per cent increase in brain tumours since 1999
studies ' are split 50/50 ' in conclusions , leaving the issue open for debate
but believers fear fall - out from the ' biggest technological experiment in the history of our species '
the conference can be *streamed* online at @entity422
