by @entity0 a @entity2 toddler who developed huge life - threatening tumors pressing against his neck and chest while in the womb is now living life as a regular child after undergoing a rare and extremely risky delivery procedure			1
second - time mom @entity11 was 34 weeks pregnant when she was told her son - who her and husband @entity14 named @entity12 - had masses on his tiny body that were ' like airplane pillows but cut in half and then under his arm '			1
while the tumors were likely blocking @entity12 's airway passages , he remained protected in utero because his blood was oxygenated through the umbilical cord			1
but , once delivered , doctors did not believe @entity12 would be capable of breathing on his own			1
success : @entity27 underwent a life - saving surgery seconds after being born with his umbilical cord still attached to remove tumors on his neck and chest , which would have prevented him breathing to save @entity12 , doctors performed a rare and risky surgery during the delivery called the exit procedure , which involves operating on the infant when they are out of the uterus but before the umbilical cord has been clamped happy mom : @entity11 was not able to hold her son @entity12 until he was two - months - old ' i could n't stop crying , ' @entity11 told @entity43 of receiving the news			1
' i would just sit in our nursery and cry			0
( but ) i knew when he was in me , he was safe			0
' in order to save @entity12 , doctors prepared to perform a unique surgery known as the exit procedure , standing for @entity52 , whereby the infant is operated on as soon as they are out of the uterus but before the umbilical cord has been clamped			1
dr. @entity56 , a perinatologist at the @entity58 @entity57 who treated @entity11 , said there were serious risks involved in the surgery			1
' when you look at the literature in every single case , the mortality is high , ' said dr. @entity67			0
more than 40 medical personnel used two operating rooms to practice the procedure			1
@entity11 said she spent the weeks leading up to the surgery in ' depressed mode ' , but calmed down after talking to dr. @entity73			0
' you 're going to wake up to beautiful baby boy , ' @entity11 recalled dr. @entity73 telling her as she entered the operating room			0
' do n't be sad , this is a not a day to be sad			0
this is a day to be happy			0
' despite the tracheotomy tube and ventilator , @entity12 continued to grow and develop happy and healthily , his parents said then , just nine days before his first birthday , @entity12 ripped out his tube one night and , surprisingly , was able to breath on his own perfectly fine once @entity11 was under anesthesia , doctors had to figure out how to keep her body from naturally going into delivery , which could compromise @entity12 's health if doctors had not established an airway in time			1
to trick her body , doctors flushed warm saline in @entity11 's uterus			0
@entity73 said doctors partially delivered @entity12 , gave him a sedative and then intubated him to establish an airway in about 15 minutes			1
they then delivered @entity12 and cut the umbilical cord normally before whisking him to the neonatal intensive care unit			1
' all i remember [ after the surgery ] is seeing my husband and asking if my baby was here , ' @entity11 said			2
' [ he said ] he 's here and he 's beautiful and he 's doing great			0
' although doctors were able to establish an airway , @entity12 was n't given the all - clear			2
the large tumors were not cancerous , but they were filled with fluid that could not be easily drained and were pressing on his lungs			2
it took nearly three months before doctors were able to try an experimental medication that could diminish the tumors			2
@entity11 and her husband were n't able to hold their son until he was two months old			0
for his first birthday , @entity27 got to go home with mom @entity11 and dad @entity14 without being attached to a ventilator for the first time in his life @entity27 now looks like any other toddler , save for a small amount of excess skin at the bottom of his face and top of his neck at three months , the @entity11 family were finally able to take @entity12 home , although the infant had a tracheotomy tube that required he be on a ventilator at all times			1
then nine days before his first birthday , @entity12 pulled out his tracheotomy tube in the middle of the night , potentially leaving him unable to breathe			2
@entity11 said she almost panicked and called 911 , but resisted because @entity12 appeared to be fine			2
after ending up back at the @entity58 @entity57 , doctors decided not to put the tracheotomy back in since the tracheotomy hole had nearly closed and @entity12 was breathing fine on his own			1
for his first birthday , @entity12 got to go home without being attached to a ventilator for the first time in his life			2
' this kid goes to the beat of his own drum , ' @entity11 said			0
all smiles : in a few months @entity12 will turn two , having come a long way from his initial prognosis ' he 's a little miracle and we [ could n't ] believe that for his first birthday he 's running around talking			0
' earlier this month , the @entity11 family reunited with some of the doctors and nurses that helped deliver and treat @entity12 as a newborn			2
dr. @entity73 said that seeing @entity12 recovery was remarkable knowing how extensive his tumors were at birth			1
' you totally would n't be able to tell if you saw him , ' she said			0
' seeing him grow through that whole procedure and treatment afterwards ... it 's awesome			0
it really exemplifies why we 're doing this			0

doctors discovered tumors pressing against the neck and chest of @entity27 while he was in utero
the baby was developing fine but would have likely been unable to breath on his own after birth
over 40 medical personnel at the @entity58 @entity180 prepared for a surgery known as the exit procedure
the operation took place as soon as @entity12 was born but before the umbilical cord was cut
after *subsequent* treatments to further remove the tumors , @entity12 is almost two and *thriving*
