sometimes all you need in life , as suggested by legendary @entity4 slacker @entity2 , is the bare necessities			2
this brown bear appears to follow the lead of her idol , as she scratches her back against a tree , mimicking the much - loved cartoon bear			1
although in this case , the bear with an itch is far from @entity17 's @entity16 , enjoying a self - made grooming session in a forest in northern @entity20			1
bare necessities : the female brown bear enjoys a self - made back - scratch with the help of a tree after using the tree - trunk , the female bear uses a giant branch to scratch , and she looks the spitting image of @entity2 from the famous scene in the @entity17 inspired @entity4 movie			1
@entity32 , from @entity33 , spotted the bear during a trip to northern @entity20 , while watching the bears activity discreetly from an armoured hide			1
he said : ' it was like a scene straight out of @entity40 with @entity2 scratching himself on the tree			2
' although this was a different species of bear , they all seem to love a good tree scratch			1
' mr @entity32 spent hours covertly covering the trees in honey in a bid to attract the bears			0
hello there ! the bear appears to be waving to the photographer from her spot the woods in northern @entity20 look - a - like : the bear resembled everyone 's favourite @entity4 bear - @entity2 from the @entity40 that 's why a bear can rest at ease : the brown bear grabs hold of a young tree for a scratching session the original : @entity2 , voiced by @entity66 , uses a palm tree in the 1967 @entity4 animation of the classic book by @entity17 he then retreated to the camouflaged hide around 30ft away where he patiently waited , finally capturing the bears in action three hours later			1
mr @entity32 added : ' i was at the mercy of the bears			0
i was alone in this hide , which the bears could very easily dismantle if they wanted to			0
' there were several precautions i had to undertake to make sure there were no traces of honey left on my hands which could attract the bears			0
' they absolutely love honey and nothing will get in their way when they smell it , so it was very important not to have a single trace of the stuff on me			0
scratching an itch : the female bear made sure she sharpened her claws on the tree - trunk as well @entity96 : photographer @entity32 , from @entity33 , spotted the bear during a trip to northern @entity20 @entity99 : mr @entity32 admitted to spending hours covering the trees in honey in order to attract the bears ' but i was still on edge			1

' mr @entity32 says he honed the techniques he used to capture these intimate images during repeated trips to the remote @entity20 forest			1
he said : ' i have visited this area for three years in a row and had many great encounters			0
' basically the area is run by a wilderness centre in the north of @entity20			2
you trek into the forest away from any civilisation , they then lock you in a hide and leave you			2
' you live among the bears for a night			0
