the father of two was wearing a basic buoyancy aid instead of a self - inflating lifejacket at the time			2

coroner @entity106 recorded that the tee - total father ’s death was a ' terrible and tragic accident			1

however , the former @entity131 aviator admitted to having ' concerns ' after he noticed mr @entity11 's footwear			2
' it was the shoes he was wearing			0
he was wearing black trainers but they were not deck shoes as far as i was aware			0
they did n’t have a non-slip sole on them			0
' there was just something niggling in the back of my head - it was the shoes and the lifejacket and all the kit he had was brand new			2
' it was shiny and had n’t been used			0
it was not scuffed - it was brand new stuff			2
' however , he said mr @entity11 had assured him he was a @entity128 and he left him to set sail after he had given his buyer a ' comprehensive brief ' of the boat			1

it still had its engine running as it crashed into the shore			0
ms @entity25 said she had arranged to call her husband at midday and every two hours to check his progress but had struggled to get through			0

' as soon as i heard this guy say he was the coastguard i knew something awful had happened			0
' he said the boat had been found off the @entity22 but @entity11 was not on it			1
it ’s all a bit of a blur from there			0
' ms @entity25 , who said she met her husband while they worked for pharmaceutical company @entity198 in 1997 , was co-director in their it consultancy firm which they set up in 2000			2
she said they had joined @entity204 in @entity13 in september 2011 , and planned to travel together			0

it ’s something he had discussed for quite a while , ' she told the inquest			0
