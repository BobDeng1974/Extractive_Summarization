the 22 - year - old soldier wrote about the horror of war and the life - changing injuries he sustained during enemy action in @entity18			1
@entity7 has had his poems published 68 years after he wrote them on the battlefields of @entity18 ' the @entity22 of @entity1 ' : @entity7 was 22 when he was sent to war in northern @entity24 he even ripped pages from his book and sent copies home to his mother in @entity29 , @entity30 , so his work would survive if he died in battle			1
now @entity7 has finally made it into print after a researcher at @entity36 , read his collection of poems			1
@entity39 , who lectures on propaganda and the use of information in war , described @entity7 as the ' @entity22 of @entity1 '			1
he discovered the poems while writing a book on @entity7 ’s father @entity46 , who worked as a spy and wrote espionage novels			1
recognition : @entity7 was offered the publishing deal after a researcher found his poems in his mother 's papers dedicated : @entity7 learned to write with his left hand after being injured , and continues to write today @entity7 joined the @entity55 in 1941 as a lance bombardier but was sent to @entity18 with the 1st @entity57 , the black watch			1
he was in @entity59 , @entity24 , for 21 days , during which time he witnessed horrific scenes that still haunt him to this day			2
injured in shelling , he returned to @entity62 with a broken right arm , damaged hip and ripped bladder			2
the anthology of 125 poems ' covers profound human experiences and is drawn from a life spanning 92 years ' but @entity7 refused to give up poetry and continued to work from his hospital bed after learning to write with his left hand			1
@entity7 , who now lives in @entity29 , says : ' i have read poetry all my life and was gripped by poets such as @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 at school			1
' i lived my teenage years talking in couplets and felt compelled to write down my thoughts in the form of poems			2
discovery : senior lecturer @entity39 found the poems ' i wrote my first poem at the age of 16			1
it was about @entity89 and how the young men who gave their lives should never be forgotten			0
' that turned out to be the first of many , as i continued write throughout the war and even today			0
' many people think war is a continuous horror but you do n’t face a continual barrage of bullets			0
' there were quiet times in the trenches , when i was just sitting and waiting			0
' it was at times like this that i pulled out my pocket book and wrote about the irony and tragedy of war as i saw it			1
' i was not writing for an audience but did hope my poems would be published one day			2
' i sent them to my mum to look after because i knew there was a risk i would fail to make it home			0
' @entity7 describes his work as ' the reflections of an ordinary soldier , of any nationality , temporarily withdrawn from the front line to an area of comparative peace , in any of the wars to which unwilling @entity124 has been subjected by the ambitions , greed or stupidity of his rulers '			1
what has war done to the @entity131 ? it has trained him ; mentally to be alert always , and to think swiftly ; physically to endure without food , without sleep , and often without hope			0
it has taught him to gaze on the friend who fell beside him in battle , with less compassion and anger than inward relief : relief that the bullet found a heart other than his own ; but relief followed instantly by guilt that will never go away			0
it has taught him to think of the enemy framed in the sights of his rifle without pity , but with only the kill - or - be - killed instincts of the jungle ; and not as a man like himself , with an anxious wife and children ; with a small house , and a garden in which to rest on summer ev’nings : as a man who cares as little for the purpose of the war as he does himself , and is even now thinking longingly of home ... @entity162 has made him incurably restless , in a world grown madly impatient ; it has caused him to seek any form of gaudy entertainment promising forgetfulness			2
it had shown him there is nothing so mean , so lacking - in - glory as war ; and the common peoples of the earth desire only friendship and peace ; but there always will be war , because their rulers and mentors lead them away from peace			2
it has taught him that the common peoples must unite and destroy the causes of war before their rulers fail again , and they perish with the whole of the species of @entity124 he hopes readers will reflect on the ' horrors ' of war , ' i do n’t think for one minute that my poems will stop people fighting but i do hope they will make people pause for a moment and think			2
' some of what i witnessed was so horrific it still pains me to talk about it			0
i only talk about those experiences with people who were there			0
' on my final day on the frontline , we became surrounded by @entity208 and i was hit by shells as we tried to make our escape			2
' i was in agony and initially thought i was going to lose my arm			0
' but i later realised i had been lucky and it was one of the happiest days of my life because it proved to be my ticket out of there			0
' @entity7 dedicated one poem to a nurse who cared for him as he recovered from his injuries			1
he says he is ' delighted ' to have secured a publishing deal ' because it shows my work has a commercial value			2
' it is now being read by more people , who can learn about the horrors of war			0
' it is an honour to be mentioned in the same breath as poets like @entity22			0
' @entity7 was posted to @entity233 after he was discharged from hospital , having fully recovered			1
there he met his barmaid wife @entity236 , with whom he had two children			0
on leaving the army @entity7 secured a job with the @entity240 , where he worked until his retirement			1
@entity236 died 12 years ago			0
senior lecturer @entity39 says ' @entity7 is devoted to literature and poetry and his own collection of poems is a treasure trove			1
' he has a wonderful technique , which he combines with feeling and insight to produce something very special			0
' he captures the despair , fear and sadness of war like the poetic greats of @entity256 , such as @entity22 and @entity257			0
' i was very moved by his work and believed his work deserved a wider audience			0
it is now selling very well			0
