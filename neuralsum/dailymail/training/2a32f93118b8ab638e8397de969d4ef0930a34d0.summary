elephants in the @entity2 bush are being trained to use their super-strength sense of smell to sniff out explosives and poachers			1
the project , supported by the @entity8 , was inspired after elephants in @entity10 were observed using their trunks to help them avoid areas full of land mines left over from decades of civil war			1
@entity16 , operator of @entity19 ranch in @entity2 , said : ' an elephant 's nose is amazing			2
think about mammoths , which had to find food through the ice			0
' elephants in the @entity2 bush are being trained to use their super-strength sense of smell to sniff out explosives and poachers during tests , a 17 - year - old male elephant named @entity28 was walked past a row of buckets - once of which would have a swab laced with @entity35 scent stapled to the bottom of one			1
sticking his trunk into each bucket , he was taught to stop and raise a front leg when he came across the one with the swab			2
he got the bucket right each time			0
and like a sniffer dog , he was rewarded with his favourite treat : the marula fruit			0
@entity47 army researchers , who have been involved in the project for five years , say there will be no elephants on the field but robotic drones could collect material for them to test			1

despite their super-strength senses of smell , the jury is still out on who has the better nose : dogs or elephants			2
but mr @entity76 did say there was some truth in the old adage that an elephant never forgets			0
' dogs require constant training while the elephants seem to understand and remember the scent without the need for constant training , ' he said			0
mr @entity16 had previously trained a dozen elephants for anti-poaching patrols in @entity95			0
after his family lost their three farms to president @entity100 's land seizures in 2002 , he moved to @entity2 to continue his work .			1

elephants in @entity2 are being taught to sniff out explosives in project
inspired by *animals* in wild avoiding land mines left over from civil war
they wo *n't* be used in field but will test scents brought by robotic drones
