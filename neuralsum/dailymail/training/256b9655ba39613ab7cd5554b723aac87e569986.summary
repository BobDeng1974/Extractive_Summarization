a stunning late , long - range strike by @entity1 earned 10 - man @entity2 a 1 - 1 draw against @entity5 in a pulsating clash at @entity7			1
@entity8 gave the visitors an early lead before @entity11 was shown a red card for a high tackle on @entity14			1
@entity2 felt the visitors should also have been reduced for 10 men , but @entity17 was shown just a yellow after he pulled down @entity19 when through on goal			1
however @entity2 kept fighting and @entity1 levelled two minutes before full - time			1
@entity1 celebrates in front of the @entity2 fans after scoring a late equaliser it was a slow start from @entity2 as @entity5 snapped into the early tackles and denied them any time on the ball			1
the pressure soon told and home goalkeeper @entity30 had to act swiftly to gather a @entity32 corner just as @entity33 was about to pounce			0
the opening goal arrived on 11 minutes			0
@entity35 launched a long throw into the box and @entity17 rose well and flicked on at the near post before @entity8 placed his header expertly beyond @entity30			2
just two minutes later and the same tactic almost worked again			0
@entity35 's throw into the danger zone was half - cleared and @entity8 fizzed a right - footed half - volley narrowly over from 20 - yards			1
the @entity44 pressed forward but rarely troubled @entity45 in the @entity5 goal			2
@entity11 , @entity2 's pacey winger , had some joy down the right against @entity49 but when he wriggled free and powered towards the box his cross was well intercepted by @entity52			1
@entity11 protests his innocence after being shown a red card for his tackle on @entity14 @entity2 : @entity30 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity11 , @entity63 , @entity64			1
subs : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72			0
@entity5 : @entity45 , @entity73 , @entity17 , @entity52 , @entity49 , @entity35 , @entity8 , @entity32 , @entity14 , @entity74 , @entity33			1
subs : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82			0
referee : @entity84 ( @entity85 ) it was @entity11 's final contribution			2
on 32 minutes his ill - timed tackle on @entity14 was late and high			0
@entity14 crumpled to the floor in agony and referee @entity84 quickly flashed his red card			0
@entity2 responded well and created their best chance of the game on 38 minutes			1
@entity61 played a clever ball into the box and @entity2 's @entity96 striker @entity19 fired in a powerful near post volley that @entity45 was forced to beat away for a corner			2
the hosts created the first opening of the second half on 52 minutes			0
@entity102 picked - out @entity60 in the box who turned well but shot straight at @entity45			0
@entity2 , playing with 10 - men , continued to press			1
the impressive @entity1 whipped in a corner and @entity19 's near post flick rattled the outside of @entity45 's post			0
@entity32 holds off @entity2 's @entity63 during a strong first half for @entity5 then came the controversy			1
on 63 minutes @entity17 , the @entity5 defender , hauled down @entity19 who was through on goal			2
this crowd chanted for a red but the referee issued a relieved looking @entity17 a yellow			0
to add to the agony , @entity1 cracked the post from the resultant free kick			0
@entity45 then denied @entity1 with a fine save on 70 minutes before @entity17 cleared off the line after @entity19 's close - range flick from @entity125 's shot had beaten @entity45			2
however @entity2 gave it one last push and with two minutes left were rewarded			2
@entity1 picked up the ball 30 - yards out and for once @entity5 's defence failed to get tight			1
the @entity130 took aim and lashed home a superb left - footed effort into the top corner			0
and it could have been even worse for @entity5 had @entity68 not skied an effort way over the bar when he was clean through on goal with the very last kick of the game			0
@entity141 looks on as his @entity5 side relinquished a lead against 10 men on @entity145			1

@entity8 puts @entity5 ahead in 12th minute at @entity7
@entity2 reduced to 10 men when @entity11 is sent off after half hour
@entity1 equalises with two minutes to play
