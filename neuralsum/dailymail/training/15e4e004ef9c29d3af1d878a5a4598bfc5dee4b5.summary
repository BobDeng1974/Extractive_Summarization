@entity1 head coach @entity0 dismissed suggestions that he is taking @entity3 lightly by selecting virtually a second - string side for the @entity6 clash			1
the @entity1 boss has made 13 changes to the team who defeated @entity11 24 - 21 at @entity12 last weekend , with captain @entity13 retained but wearing the no 6 jersey for the first time in what will be his 137th match for his country			1
@entity0 surprised many with his selection despite the return of superstar stand - off @entity22 , who is making his first international start in a year following injury			1
all @entity1 coach @entity26 ( left ) chats with @entity13 ahead of saturday 's game at @entity6 ‘ we ’re taking @entity3 very seriously , ’ insisted the @entity29 coach			1
‘ we ’ve already said that it ’s a loseable game if we do n’t prepare well and get our feet on the floor really quickly after last week			2
‘ we have a lot of respect for @entity3 rugby but we ’ve got our own plans and our own agenda that we ’ve got to live by			2
i think people are totally misreading the situation if they think we are not respecting them			2
‘ we know they always bring a really physical game to the park but what we ’ve seen of late is that they are trying to change their game , trying to play a fast game			0
and when teams do that and are successful at it , they score points			0
’ @entity3 coach @entity54 is expecting a ferocious @entity1 challenge despite their personnel changes asked why he thought @entity1 had dominated the fixture , with 27 wins and two draws in 29 previous meetings going back more than 100 years , he said : ‘ i ’m not sure why they have n’t managed it			1
a lot of it might be self - belief			1
‘ success breeds success and the opposite can be said about losing			0
‘ what i do know is that if we leave them in the competition for a large part of the game , then they will grow another arm and leg and become really dangerous			0
so we have to start well and put points on the board			0
’ @entity0 does not fear any insight his fellow @entity29 coach @entity54 might bring to the @entity3 camp , however			1
@entity1 fly half @entity22 fires out a pass during a training drill at @entity85 in @entity86 ‘ well , he has never coached the @entity1 and he has been out of the country for eight years , ’ he said			1
‘ so i ’m not sure how much insight he has really got			0
’ @entity54 , for his part , also insisted that the tourists were not being disrespectful with their team selection — and that they were determined to maintain their undefeated run against the @entity94			2
‘ even during the @entity98 tournament in @entity99 , the @entity1 players were overhead talking amongst themselves how they did not want to be the first team to lose to @entity3 at any level , be it under - 20 , sevens and certainly not at @entity1 level , ’ said the @entity3 boss			1
‘ that is why they are comfortable with the team they have selected to play us			2
their coaching staff know those players will give it absolutely everything and they will be all the more dangerous for it			0
’ @entity54 added that he did not think the changes — with the likes of @entity117 winners @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 being left out of the squad completely — would disrupt the @entity1			1
‘ what they do is their business , ’ he said			0
‘ these players who take us on , you may say , have less experience but will not be lesser players for @entity1			1
‘ we are anticipating a very enthusiastic and dangerous team			2
’ the difference in approach to the match could not be more marked			0
while @entity0 has rung the changes , @entity54 , as exclusively revealed by @entity135 , has shown faith in the same starting xv that defeated @entity138 last saturday			1
‘ logic will say we have no chance of winning this , ’ he said			0
‘ reasonable people will say we have no chance but our players have big hearts and want to give this a crack			0
‘ we are focusing on what we can do and how we can stay in there and be competitive right to the end			0
