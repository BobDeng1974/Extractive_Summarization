by @entity0 when the @entity6 premier visited @entity7 this week he was greeted with an honour guard , a @entity2 reception and a meeting with the @entity4			1
but one aspect of @entity11 ’s welcome fell somewhat short in the eyes of @entity6 officials – the red carpet rolled out for his arrival at @entity16			1
after plans for mr @entity11 ’s visit were shown to the @entity21 government , aides complained that the carpet leading from the steps of his plane was not long enough			1
on his arrival at @entity16 he is said to have complained the red carpet was too short ‘ they saw a diagram of the arrangements at @entity16 and complained that the carpet was three metres too short , ’ said one of the visit organisers			1
the objection was raised with @entity38 , the prime minister ’s chief of staff , but he is said to have told the @entity6 official he had other things to worry about			0
‘ he said that he was sure the carpet would meet their requirements , ’ the visit organiser told the @entity43			2
mr @entity11 is said to have demanded to meet the @entity4 , who welcomed him to @entity46 , despite the fact that it is relatively unusual for her to receive world leaders who are not heads of state			1
during the visit , she welcomed him to @entity46 where they were joined by the @entity52 in the @entity53			0
later he went to @entity2 for lunch with the prime minister and business leaders where he was served a @entity6 - themed menu including claypot chicken in a savoury sauce with shiitake mushrooms			0
during the visit , the @entity4 welcomed him to @entity46 where they were joined by the @entity52 in the @entity53 one of @entity6 ’s @entity64 - controlled newspapers was said to be so angry about the furore about whether mr @entity11 would be hosted by the @entity4 that it wrote an editorial in which it called @entity69 an ‘ old , declining empire ’ that resorts to ‘ eccentric acts ’ to cover its waning importance			1
@entity6 ’s @entity73 yesterday played down the diplomatic row over the length of the red carpet			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity69 side closely co-ordinated with the @entity6 side in the reception organisation and visit results , took the initiative in making considerate arrangements and made great efforts to ensure the full success of premier @entity11 ’s visit			2
the @entity6 side expresses its appreciation			0
’ the demanding requirement was perhaps surprising considering in december 2012 the current @entity6 administration banned red carpets , welcome banners , floral arrangements and grand receptions for @entity6 officials travelling domestically on official business			0
regulations introduced also told officials travelling overseas to restrict the size of their delegations and avoid large receptions at the airport on their arrival .			0

aides complained the carpet leading from the steps of his plane was *n't* long enough
said to have been three metres short after seeing a diagram
