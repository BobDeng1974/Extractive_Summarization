the first ' hard evidence ' that other universes exist has been found by scientists			1
cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the @entity8 spacecraft have concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes			1
the map shows radiation from the @entity15 13.8billion years ago that is still detectable in the universe - known as cosmic microwave radiation			0
scientists had predicted that it should be evenly distributed , but the map shows a stronger concentration in the south half of the sky and a ' cold spot ' that can not be explained by current understanding of physics			0
@entity28 , theoretical physicist at the @entity30 at @entity31 , and @entity32 , professor at @entity33 , predicted that anomalies in radiation existed and were caused by the pull from other universes in 2005			2
now that she has studied the @entity8 data , dr @entity28 believes her hypothesis has been proven			2
her findings imply there could be an infinite number of universes outside of our own			0
she said : ' these anomalies were caused by other universes pulling on our universe as it formed during the @entity15			2
' they are the first hard evidence for the existence of other universes that we have seen			0
' last year , scientists were able to create a map of light from when the universe was just 380,000 years old better quality : previous maps of radiation ( left ) were not as detailed as the recent @entity8 map ( right ) although some scientists remain sceptical about the theory of other universes , these findings may be a step towards changing views on physics			1
the @entity69 , which runs the £ 515million @entity8 telescope , said : ' because precision of @entity8 ’s map is so high , it made it possible to reveal some peculiar unexplained features that may well require new physics to be understood			1
' @entity77 professor of theoretical physics @entity78 told the @entity80 that the findings could be real evidence of the existence of other universes			1
while @entity85 , professor of astrophysics at the university , told the newspaper : ' such ideas may sound wacky now , just like the @entity90 did three generations ago			0
but then we got evidence and now it has changed the whole way we think about the universe			0

scientists studied radiation data gathered by @entity8 telescope
claim anomalies show gravitational pull from other universes
could be the first real evidence to support *controversial* theory
