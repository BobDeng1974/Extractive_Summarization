by @entity0 information about an undercover operation to get information from a suspect in the murder of @entity7 , pictured , was leaked by one of the handlers , it emerged today an undercover police operation to target a suspect in the @entity7 murder inquiry was thrown into turmoil after a leak by their handler , it emerged today			1
two police officers , a man and a woman , moved into a house next door to one of the prime suspects , posing as a couple , and set out to befriend the suspect , who was seen as a potential weak link , in a top - secret sting			1
but the safety of the officers , who lived in the property for several years , passing on useful intelligence to detectives , was compromised when one of their welfare officers told a friend about the covert operation			1
the leak only came to light when the friend , who had no connection to @entity41 ( @entity41 ) force , which supplied the covert officers , was spoken to by police about an affair she had with a @entity41 officer not linked to the @entity7 sting			1
the handler was removed from the unit for leaking confidential information , but police bosses decided not to stop the operation , according to a tip passed on to the @entity54			0
the undercover operation , which is thought to have begun in 2002 , nearly a decade after the black teenager was killed , continued , with the couple often wired up to relay live conversations with the suspect			2
it involved two officers from @entity62 posing as a couple who had just moved down to @entity64 from the north , as police believed using officers from @entity64 would be too obvious			0
only a handful of the top officers at @entity41 knew about the sting , and a back - up team of 20 officers was on standby in case the couple 's cover was blown , placing their lives in danger			2
the suspect targeted by the sting - one of five men suspected of murdering the 18 - year - old - has not been named			1
@entity41 had been asked to provide officers to go undercover as it was thought too obvious to use @entity64 officers			0
but the officers were not involved in the operation by @entity87 's disgraced @entity86 , an ultra-secret wing of @entity89 which is now the subject of a public inquiry			0
earlier this month , a report into the @entity86 unit revealed that it had placed a spy in the camp of the family of the teenager , who was stabbed to death in south - east @entity64 in april 1993			1
@entity7 , 38 , left , and @entity7 , 37 , right , were both convicted of murdering @entity7 one senior source with surveillance expertise , said : ' i would be surprised if my officers were left undercover if their safety had been compromised by such a monumental leak of information			2
' the @entity105 and @entity41 would have no guarantee of knowing who else the woman had gossiped to about the operation			0
' assistant chief constable @entity110 , of @entity41 , said : ' @entity41 does not normally confirm or deny information about undercover police deployments unless it has become public knowledge as part of criminal proceedings			0
' the position is necessary to protect the identity of those officers who carry out , or have carried out , undercover work			0
