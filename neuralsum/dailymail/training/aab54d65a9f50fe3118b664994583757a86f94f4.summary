by @entity0 published : 21:13 est , 15 september 2012 updated : 07:15 est , 2 october 2012 sorrow : author @entity1 , pictured with his wife @entity2 , has revealed his sons do n't talk to him in the books of award - winning @entity1 , reconciliation is a recurring theme			1
the author of the worldwide bestseller @entity8 , he has woven emotive tales of tearful reunions into several of his most successful novels			1
so it is perhaps poignant that he is estranged from his own two grown - up sons , a fact revealed in a recent biography of his chequered life by @entity17			1
@entity1 is deeply troubled by the family fallout but now , for the first time , it can be revealed how his alienation from his sons @entity23 , 49 , and @entity24 , 46 , is a tragic reflection of his own troubled youthful relationship with his stepfather @entity27			1
he also admits to subsequently having an aching desire to know his real father , actor @entity29 , about whom his mother never spoke			1
@entity1 , 68 , who married young after falling in love when just 19 , says he spent too little time with his sons and that perhaps , like his own stepfather , he could be difficult to live with			1
‘ it is a difficulty but we all have our own sadness and i long for reconciliation , ’ he says wistfully			2
‘ it is to do with my own shortcomings as a parent and it is a constant theme in my books			1
i believe in concord rather than fight			2
most fights are a waste of energy and anger is very bad for us			2
’ @entity23 , an @entity49 teacher who lives in @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity24 , a writer who lives in @entity53 , have never explained the rift with their father			1
and @entity1 , too , remains silent on the subject			1
previously , he has only confessed that his remorse over the ongoing deadlock between them ‘ lasts longer than any kind of pleasure that comes from success ’			2
‘ i was too young to deal with it all			2
i do n’t think i had really grown out of being a child myself , ’ he told his biographer			2
today , he adds : ‘ now i have grown older , more mature and can relax into who i am , so although i am not that much wiser i am a better grandfather than i was a father			1
’ heartbreaking story : @entity1 's tale seems all the more sad after the joy he brought to children and adults with his popular book and film @entity8 there have been some clues about the reasons for the rift			1
the author also has an adopted daughter , @entity81 , who did contribute to the biography			1
recently , she has suggested that her brothers ’ schooling could have been a factor			2
when @entity1 was a teacher he became so disenchanted with private schools that he vowed never to work in one again			1
yet despite this , he sent his sons to a private boarding school			0
‘ being sent away to school did put a distance between us and our parents , ’ @entity81 has said			0
it has also been suggested that @entity1 ’s insistence on helping other children may have had a detrimental influence on his relationship with his sons			1
the biography describes the early years of the children ’s charity he set up , @entity103 , and how it took up much of his time			1
indeed , in the book , @entity1 admits as much , saying that time ‘ hitherto lavished on our own children ’ was now spent on ‘ hordes of total strangers ’			1
@entity1 and his own stepfather were never close			1
‘ my stepfather was a demanding and domineering man			0
the author was estranged from his own father @entity29 , pictured , but they were reconciled in later life ‘ my father had wanted my older brother @entity119 and me to keep his name but my stepfather insisted we all have the same name			1
‘ although we were one family we were not one big happy family and i felt , as adopted children often do , that i did n’t belong			2
i knew better than to mention my father and he never contacted us			2
’ the young @entity1 was just two years old when his natural father @entity126 returned from the @entity127 to discover his wife @entity128 had fallen in love with soldier - turned - publisher @entity27 , and wanted to marry him			1
@entity130 bowed out and the next time @entity1 saw his father , astonishingly , was on television			1
‘ it was christmas eve 1961 and i was watching a television adaptation of @entity136 ’ @entity135 with @entity128			0
‘ @entity137 was making his way through the graveyard at dusk , when up from behind a gravestone reared the terrifying figure of @entity143 , the escaped convict , his face hideous and eyes glaring			0
‘ @entity128 , sitting beside me , let out a cry , “ @entity148			0
’ ’ it was the first time his name had been spoken in public			0
i had no idea until then what he looked like			0
’ he eventually met him a few years after seeing him on the small screen			0
‘ my mother and stepfather insisted i call them by their first names , which was trendy in the @entity163 , so it was lovely to find someone i could call @entity166			0
‘ i was more at ease with him than my stepfather and we really loved each other			0
it was equally wonderful to discover things about each other			0
@entity166 , who had married again and had two more children , was such a sympathetic person and so interested in my life			2
he came over a couple of times a year to see me and the grandchildren and often stayed with us for the weekend			0
‘ sadly , he died eight years ago , aged 87			0
he was the last of my parents to die and when it happened i thought , “ i am now an orphan			0
’ ’ i have felt more vulnerable and aware of my mortality ever since			0
’ @entity1 's masterpiece , @entity8 , has become a wildly popular film and play enjoyed across the world			1
pictured , the @entity187 in @entity188 but while @entity1 is , it seems , estranged from his sons , who refused to co-operate with the recent biography , he is a doting grandfather			1
he has seven grandchildren , aged from seven to 25			0
‘ you see some grandchildren frequently , some less frequently , ’ he confides			0
‘ because you do n’t see them every day it is not so intense as it is with your own children and that makes the times you have with them special			2
’ ‘ yes , ’ he then adds tellingly , ‘ i think not being there all the time is the key			0
but it is happily intense when they are			0
i used to read a lot to them when they were younger			2
’ rejection has been another recurring theme in @entity1 ’s life			1
when he was dating his wife @entity218 , her millionaire father , the late sir @entity215 , founder of @entity217 , considered him an unworthy suitor			2
fortunately , the @entity221 ’ marriage has been exceedingly happy and is , he believes , the rock upon which his successful career has been built			0
they met while both on holiday in @entity227 when he was 19 and she a year older			0
she became pregnant soon afterwards and sir @entity215 insisted @entity1 do the decent thing			1
‘ it was a shotgun wedding in a register office with just both sets of parents there , ’ he recalls			0
‘ he thought i was a gold digger and she could do much better , which is completely understandable			0
fortunately before he died of cancer in 1970 , i visited him in hospital and he made it clear , although not in so many words , that he was now ok about our marriage			0

writer was also estranged from his father , but they later reconciled
@entity1 's troubled story was revealed in recent biography
the heartbreaking tales seem all the more poignant because of his popularity with children across the world who have read his books
