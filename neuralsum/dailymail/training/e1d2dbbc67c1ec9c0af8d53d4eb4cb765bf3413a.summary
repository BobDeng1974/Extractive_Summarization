by @entity1 reporter published : 12:12 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 16:48 est , 13 september 2012 @entity3 's @entity2 opened up a new , experimental front in the war on obesity thursday , passing a rule banning sales of big sodas and other sugary drinks at restaurants , concession stands , and other eateries			1
the regulation , which was proposed in the spring by mayor @entity15 and approved by a panel of health experts after several months of review , puts a 16 - ounce size limit on cups and bottles of non-diet soda , sweetened teas , and other calorie - packed beverages			1
the ban will apply in fast - food joints , movie houses and @entity30 theatres , workplace cafeterias , and most other places selling prepared food			2
the restaurant and beverage industries have assailed that the plan is misguided			0
they say the city 's health experts are exaggerating the role sugary beverages have played in making @entity57 fat			1
should @entity3 put a 16 - ounce size limit on sugary sodas ? one board member , dr @entity60 , abstained from voting			1
the other 8 board members voted yes			0
' i am still sceptical			0
this is not comprehensive enough , ' @entity60 said			0
some @entity3 have also ridiculed the rule as a gross government intrusion and tens of thousands signed a petition , circulated by the industry , voicing their opposition			0
too sweet : in war on obesity , the city 's attack on sugary beverages , started last spring , concluded on thursday with a unanimous vote to ban those over 16 ounces growing : recently called @entity81 over the mayor 's efforts to closer monitor its residents ' health and wellbeing , his office released graphs like this one , showing how the size of @entity90 has grown the unprecedented regulation would follow other ambitious health moves on @entity15 's watch			1
some have proven to be national pacesetters , such as making chain restaurants post calorie counts prominently on their menus ; @entity36 's announced on wednesday that it would start displaying the information nationwide next week , before a federal requirement that could force all major chains to do so next year			2
@entity3 also has barred artificial trans fats from restaurant food and taken aggressive steps to discourage smoking			0
starting this month , dozens of city hospitals are asking mothers of newborns to listen to talks about why they should breast - feed instead of using formula			2
upset : @entity111 of @entity3 , protests the soda - ban while holding a @entity113 , one of the few exceptions to the ban due to the store considered a grocery and convenience store still here : a @entity120 is pictured , the largest of 20 to 50 ounce beverages sold at @entity113 stores with the @entity120 when filled with @entity90 supplying 600 calories @entity15 and other advocates for the soda plan — who include a roster of doctors and such food figures as chef @entity129 — see it as another pioneering step for public health			1
they say the proposal strikes at a leading cause of obesity simply by giving people a built - in reason to stop at 16 ounces : 200 calories , if it 's a regular @entity90 , compared to 240 in a 20 - ounce size			1
for someone who drinks a soda a day , the difference amounts to 14,600 calories a year , or the equivalent of 70 @entity147 bars , enough to add about four pounds of fat to a person 's body			2
beyond the numbers , some doctors and nutrition experts say the proposal starts a conversation that could change attitudes toward overeating			0
while there are many factors in obesity , ' ultimately it does come down to culture , and it comes down to taking some first steps , ' said dr @entity164 , a @entity166 professor who has studied the effect of government regulation on the obesity epidemic			0
soda makers and sellers say the plan unfairly singles out soft drinks as culprits for the nation 's fat problem , represents an overweening government effort to regulate behaviour and is so patchy as to be pointless			2
because of the web of who regulates what , it would affect a belly - buster regular soda sold at a sports arena but not a @entity113 , for instance			2
an average @entity3 goes to the movies about four times per year and buys concessions only twice , said @entity189 , a spokeswoman for the @entity192 chain			0
arguments : critics say the city 's health experts working with the mayor , pictured , are exaggerating the role sugary beverages have played in making @entity57 fat challenge : dr @entity202 , a researcher on portion sizes , speaks in support of the ban in front of the @entity2 at the @entity207 and @entity208 though thursday 's vote is unlikely to go unchallenged ' we firmly believe the choices made during the other 363 days have a much greater impact on public health , ' she said in a statement			1
thursday 's vote is unlikely to be the final word on the proposal			1
a soft - drink industry sponsored group called @entity220 — which says it has gathered more than 250,000 signatures on petitions opposing the soda plan — is considering a lawsuit and exploring legislative options for challenging the plan if it passes , spokesman @entity217 said			0
it 's not clear what legislative routes there may be : city council speaker @entity231 said wednesday she 's not interested in trying to block the expected health board vote , though she has said she is n't a fan of the soda idea			1
the rule would n't apply to lower - calorie drinks , such as water or diet soda , or to alcoholic beverages or drinks that are more than half milk or 70 per cent juice			1
enforcement would be conducted by an existing corps of city restaurant inspectors			0
a violation would lead to a $ 200 fine .			0

vote by city 's @entity2 will *prohibit* the sale of sodas and other sugary drinks over 16 - ounces at restaurants and concession stands
large beverages sold at grocery stores and select convenience stores are an exception
thursday 's vote is unlikely to be the final word on the proposal
