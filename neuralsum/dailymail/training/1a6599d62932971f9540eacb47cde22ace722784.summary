a mother in @entity1 has made history by giving birth to two sets of identical twins in one day			1

with identical twins , a single egg splits just before it implants in the uterus , @entity64 , a spokesperson for the @entity65 of obstetricians and @entity67 told @entity70			1
he said : ' in the case of this couple however , two eggs were fertilised by the sperm and then both decided to split before they were implanted , the odds of which are roughly around one in 70 million			1
' in terms of the risks , because identical twins can share an amniotic sac and a placenta , they are at risk of becoming tangled in each others ’ umbilical cords and suffer twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome — a rare placental disease that results in one twin getting less blood than the other			1
the quadruplets @entity93 , @entity40 , @entity94 and @entity95 were delivered at 31 weeks by caesarean section at the @entity97 of @entity1			1
' we tried to stick to the @entity100 theme when naming them , ' said mrs @entity6			2

' around two per cent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins , when a fertilised egg splits into two embryos			1
the @entity97 of @entity1 said the odds of delivering two sets of naturally identical twins is somewhere in the range of one in 70 million			1
but the @entity130 ’ pregnancy was completely natural			0

with identical twins , a single egg splits just before it implants in the uterus , @entity64 , a spokesperson for the @entity65 of obstetricians and @entity67 told @entity70			2
he said : ' in the case of this couple , two eggs were fertilised by the sperm and then both decided to split before they were implanted , the odds of which are indeed somewhere in the region of one in 70 million			1
' brotherly love : @entity151 holds his 2 - year - old son , @entity17 , as he looks at new arrival ace @entity95 , weighing 3 pounds , 6 ounces , came a minute after the first set of twins were born at the @entity156 of @entity1 @entity157 : @entity6 and @entity151 defied the odds of one in 70 million to have the boys mrs @entity6 and her husband thought they were having twins until their doctor detected more heartbeats not finished yet : but while they now have five boys to look after , they say they still want a little girl not done yet : @entity170 and husband @entity12 , seen here with oldest son @entity17 still hope to have a daughter precious : the quadruplets were born at @entity174 of @entity1 he added that the process has nothing to do with @entity55 ; multiple births from that tend to occur due to more than one egg being artificially inseminated , rather than an egg splitting			1
