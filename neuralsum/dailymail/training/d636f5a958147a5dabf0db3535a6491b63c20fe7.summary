@entity2 's ageing @entity1 has just two peers under the age of 40 , but 29 members who have turned 90 , new analysis reveals			1
amid fresh debate over whether peers should be axed in favour of an elected chamber , new figures show more than half of its members are over 70			1
@entity15 peer lord @entity14 , who is 73 , said it was proof @entity17 is being used as ' @entity19 's best day centre for the elderly ' with ' mediocre ' people clocking in for £ 300 - a - day , tax free			1
the average age for men in the @entity2 is 38 and women 40 , according to the @entity37			1
but the average age in the @entity1 is well over 70			1
it means that half the population is aged under 40 , and not represented in the upper house of @entity17			1
just 16 per cent of people in the @entity2 is aged over 65 , but more than half of the @entity1 are over 70			1
the figures were compiled by @entity14 , a former @entity15 mp and supporter for @entity47			1
writing for @entity48 , he warned : ' @entity1 gets bigger , staler and less legitimate with each passing day			1
' while some peers worked hard to improve the nation 's law - making , ' there are also quite a lot of mediocre people picking up £ 300 a day ( tax - free ! ) just for turning up and shuffling off , ' he claimed			2
' no amount of flummery about what ' noble ' lords they are makes up for it and for a century liberals have been attempting to stop the rot			0
' the oldest peer is former @entity65 chancellor @entity64 ( 97 ) and the youngest is @entity68 's @entity67 tsar @entity66 ( 37 ) businesswoman and @entity70 star @entity69 , aged 45 , joined the @entity1 as a @entity72 peer this month labour leader @entity73 this month unveiled his own plans to abolish the upper chamber and replace it with an elected senate			2
he said that he wants to ensure the new body properly represents all the towns , cities , regions and nations that make up the @entity2			2
but the plans drew an angry response from the @entity15 who bitterly accused @entity65 of joining with conservative mps to wreck their plans to reform the @entity1 two years ago			1
the @entity15 argue the coalition committed to @entity47 when it was formed in 2010 , but the @entity72 failed to deliver			2
according to the figures , there are no peers in their twenties and just two in their thirties			2
the youngest peer is conservative @entity66 , 37 , a former adviser to @entity68 who championed the @entity67			0
the oldest is @entity64 , the former @entity94 and deputy leader , who turned 97 in august			0
labour leader @entity73 this month called for reform of the @entity1 , but is accused of blocking a previous attempt to replace it with an elected senate the largest group are the peers in their seventies , numbering 290 in total , followed by the sixty - somethings ( 249 ) and those in their eighties ( 136 )			2
@entity65 has said that it would summon a constitutional convention early in the next parliament to consider how an elected senate would be established - including whether it could have specific regional representation functions			0
each region of @entity110 , as well as the devolved administrations of @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 , would hold meetings before the convention where people would be asked for views on the functions of the new body , as well as the most appropriate form of election			0
but lord @entity14 accused mr @entity73 of forgetting that ' it was he who played party games with right - wing @entity72 mps to torpedo ' plans for reform			1
' without his shameless , spineless partisanship in 2012 , @entity2 citizens would be preparing to choose the first elected members of the @entity1 in just seven months ' time , ' lord @entity14 added			1
@entity15 peer lord @entity14 warned that the @entity1 gets bigger , staler and less legitimate with each passing day statisticians have discovered one sliver of society in which octogenarians substantially outnumber those in their forties			1
it 's one half of @entity17 and @entity19 's best day centre for the elderly – the @entity1			1
an appointment to the @entity1 is a job - for - life given disproportionately to those who live long and well			2
the result : the average age remains stubbornly over 70			1
even with 183 new appointments since 2010 , and a stonking 408 under @entity150 and @entity151 , there are only 32 members of the @entity1 under fifty , but still 165 over eighty			2
29 of them are in their nineties while only two are a day under forty ! plenty of peers seriously decide whether or not to challenge the government in close votes based on whether doing so will affect their plans for dinner			2
of course there are a lot good people working very hard : i know many of them			0
but there are also quite a lot of mediocre people picking up £ 300 a day ( tax - free ! ) just for turning up and shuffling off			0
no amount of flummery about what ' noble ' lords they are makes up for it and for a century liberals have been attempting to stop the rot			0
yet @entity73 burst out of his paper bag last week to discover the urgency of reform as though he stood at the very beginning of history , with nothing behind him			0
he wants the @entity1 to be ' truly a @entity184 of the @entity185 and @entity186 of our whole country			2
' what a good idea ! the @entity190 proposed exactly that in a @entity191 just two years ago			0
@entity73 seems to have forgotten that it was he who played party games with right - wing @entity72 mps to torpedo it			0
no more able to lead his party than a rat could herd cats , he decided to take a cheap shot at @entity201 – the one thing @entity195 all agree they like doing			0
knowing he would sink the best chance of democracy for decades , @entity73 piously claimed to support reform ' in principle ' but refused outright to back any timetable motion to get it through the @entity209			0
without his shameless , spineless partisanship in 2012 , @entity2 citizens would be preparing to choose the first elected members of the @entity1 in just seven months ' time			1
why should anyone believe he is serious now ? @entity65 promised democracy for the @entity1 again and again in their manifestos in 1997 , 2001 and 2005			0
with big red @entity65 single - party majorities of 179 , 167 and 66 – over thirteen long years – all they produced was bookshelves full of committee and commission reports			0
@entity73 could list his manifold failings in the dust they all gathered			0
@entity1 gets bigger , staler and less legitimate with each passing day			1
yet when it comes to the crunch , @entity65 leaders always choose their right to plonk pensionable donors and trade unionists into @entity17 over the right of the people to choose their legislators			0
@entity73 has already shown that for him , as for his predecessors , patronage trumps principle			0
given half a chance , he will again			0
@entity14 is @entity243 in the @entity1			1

more than half of members of the @entity1 are over 70 , figures show
the average age for men in the @entity2 as a whole is 38 and for women is 40
analysis shows just two peers are under 40 , but 29 are aged 90 or over
@entity15 lord @entity14 says it gets ' bigger , staler , less legitimate ' by the day
