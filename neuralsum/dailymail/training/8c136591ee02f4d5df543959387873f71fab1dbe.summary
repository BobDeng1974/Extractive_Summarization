she was very angry and she would say " i want him to go down "			0
' but she felt like no one was helping her and that she was not getting help from anyone other than her friends			0
' it seemed the authorities could have done better in helping her - it was only her friends who were there for her			0
she was really scared about it all and she thought he would come after her if he got let off			2
she thought he would kill her			2
' it had been really hard for her to testify and i think that 's why she drank more because she was so scared			1
she became against all men - and she was very traumatised by it all			0
' i just felt helpless because it seemed there was nothing i could do given what she had gone through			0
the authorities should have given her a lot more help and guidance			0

she told officers she had been walking to her home in @entity39 when a car stopped and the driver offered her a lift home before attacking her inside the vehicle			2

' many , many rape victims say that the court process is as traumatic as their original ordeal			2
' this ca n't go on - a root and branch review of how victims and witnesses are treated is urgently needed			1
' a chain of vulnerability exists from the moment someone reports an incident to police - and it can break at any point			0
we need to ensure that victims and witnesses are surrounded by support from when they report to police , throughout the investigation , the court process and - critically - after trial is over , whether the accused is found guilty or innocent			1
' we need to ensure the right services are engaged , be they mental health or psychological counselling			0
