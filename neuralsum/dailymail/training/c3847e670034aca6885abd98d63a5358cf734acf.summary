@entity1 's early strike and lively first - half performance was enough for @entity3 to escape the @entity4 with all three points			1
here , @entity6 runs through how the players performed			1
@entity8 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity9 - 5.5 kicking suspect yet again and does little to instil confidence in his defence			1
@entity14 - 5 a disaster at times , giving ball away and failing to get forward			2
@entity18 - 5.5 could not handle movement and trickery of @entity3 frontline and was run ragged			2
very lucky not to concede early penalty			1
@entity23 - 6 tried his best to lead backline but was himself at sixes and sevens			2
@entity9 manages to divert @entity3 striker @entity27 away from goal at the @entity4 @entity29 - 5.5 got forward when possible but lacked quality and was also caught dithering once or twice at other end			2
@entity32 - 5 saw enough of ball and broke things up , but was simply outclassed and was needlessly sent off despite soft nature of second booking			1
@entity38 - 6 not enough flair or invention when his side needed it in first half but was much improved after break and cracked bar with one vicious drive			2
@entity46 - 5 @entity47 throughout and slowed things up far too much when he did come into possession			2
@entity51 attempts to keep the ball from @entity3 defender @entity53 on saturday @entity54 - 6 way below standards he has set this season but was doing the job of two men after @entity61 dismissal			0
@entity51 - 5.5 the odd flash of creativity but off the pace against fitter and stronger opponents			0
@entity66 - 5.5 not afforded a kick in the first half but was hardly helped by poor supply - line			0
substitutes @entity71 ( on 77 ) - 5.5 @entity72 ( on 77 ) - 6 @entity32 receives his marching orders after picking up a second yellow card against @entity3 @entity3 ( 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 ) @entity75 - 6 a spectator in the first - half but did what he had to with minimum fuss after break			1
@entity81 - 6.5 strong when he had to be , although that was n’t often			0
@entity83 - 7 strolled through and used his passing range to prise open @entity8 defence from deep before moving into midfield and again impressing second - half			1
@entity1 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity3 team mates after scoring the opener in the first - half @entity53 - 6.5 like the rest of his defensive comrades he enjoyed an easy 90 minutes			1
@entity1 - 7.5 should have won a penalty before his clever opener and was close to spectacular second			1
beginning to shine after slow start			0
@entity98 - 7 barely had to break sweat but kept the ball well and anchored midfield with authority			0
@entity3 captain @entity103 celebrates in front of the away fans after his side took a first - half lead @entity108 - 7.5 never wasted a ball and teased passes around the park			0
took the armband second half			0
@entity114 - 6.5 saw the weakness in @entity14 and supported attack at every opportunity			0
@entity103 - 7 was in the mood for goals and went close three times in first half before departing at interval			1
@entity123 - 8 outstanding , so easy on the eye and terrorised hosts with his cunning runs			0
@entity108 lets fire but his long range effort flew high and wide over the @entity8 goal @entity27 - 7 he was more graft than craft and did not allow home defence a moment ’s rest			1
substitutes @entity139 ( on 46 ) - 6.5 rash booking was first contribution but steadied and was comfortable			0
@entity142 ( on 66 ) - 6 frustrated team - mates at times with poor decision - making but picked up where @entity27 left off with work - rate			0
@entity3 striker @entity27 failed to score from this promising position before being substituted in the second - half @entity151 striker @entity142 , passing @entity18 , came off the bench in the second - half against @entity8			1
