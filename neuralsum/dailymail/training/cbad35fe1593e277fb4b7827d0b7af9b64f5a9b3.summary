one of @entity1 's least wanted dogs has finally been rehomed - after almost seven years in kennels			1
@entity4 the lurcher was taken in as a four - month - old puppy in 2007 , but instead of quickly settling into a new home , @entity4 spent the next 50 dog years at the rescue centre as he was overlooked by around 17,000 potential suitors			1
then , just before @entity14 , following a @entity13 appeal , @entity10 and @entity11 came forward to give the dog a new home			2

' if dogs can have a sense of humour then @entity4 certainly has one , he is already very attached to my wife and i and he likes to be with us all of the time			2
' his new favourite trick involves moving his duvet in front of the door and falling asleep so that we ca n't leave the room			0
' he thoroughly enjoyed his first @entity14 as part of the family , especially his favourite roasted bone from the butchers			0

@entity4 the lurcher was taken in by the @entity18 as a young puppy in 2007
staff *believed* the four - month - old puppy would be quickly rehomed
but two *people* *decided* that @entity4 was far too energetic and returned him
@entity10 from @entity27 , @entity28 rehomed the lucky lurcher
