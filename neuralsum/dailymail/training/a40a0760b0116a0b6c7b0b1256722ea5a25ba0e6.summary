by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 a suspected gun factory which used a state - of - the - art 3d printer was uncovered by police yesterday			2
stunned officers believe a gang were using the machine to make deadly firearms			1
they recovered a freshly - made plastic magazine and trigger during a raid in @entity14 , @entity15 , which could be used to create a handgun			1
’ det insp @entity32 , of @entity20 , told @entity33 : ‘ these could be the next generation of firearms			1
’ the discovery is believed to be the first of its kind in @entity41 and confirms the worst fears of security chiefs			2
they warned just a few weeks ago that criminals were attempting to use 3d printing technology to manufacture guns			1
police fear terrorists and criminals could use the machines and plans that are readily available to download online to circumvent gun controls			0
parts : officers found a number of components which could have been used to make a handgun , including a trigger ministers have also been warned that the plastic parts may not be detected by x-ray machines and other airport security checks			1
the seized parts , which were found near an industrial 3d printing machine , were being examined by forensic experts last night			2
a police spokesman said a man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of making gunpowder			0
in the @entity72 , several guns have already been produced using the technology , with varying degrees of success			1
one of the latest models , which includes a rifled barrel to ensure deadly accuracy , is said to have been made with just £ 15 of materials			2
the latest generation of 3d printers work by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects			1
the guns are assembled from separate printed components made from plastic , with only the firing pin and a few bolts made from metal			1
the @entity93 said it will not be possible to ban 3d printers , so officials are working on alternative strategies			0
bullets : officers believed this piece of plastic was a freshly - made shell magazine in may , blueprints for the first - ever plastic gun produced on a 3 - d printer were downloaded over 100,000 times in the first four days after they were uploaded			1
designs for the ' liberator ' pistol were posted online by the @entity72 company @entity110 the @entity111 ordered the website to take down the blueprints , on the basis that the plans could violate export regulations			0
the blueprints , that could be produced on @entity117 printers costing as little as £ 600 were seen as a breakthrough because no one had previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition and could pass through security scanners without detection			1
the first plastic gun to be assembled in this way cost just £ 16 and was built using the state - of - the - art machine , some nails and some household screws			1
the engineeer was able to fire nine .38 caliber bullets			0
these could include stiff jail sentences for possession of the weapons and making it illegal to download the plans			0
officials believe that other criminal groups have attempted to construct weapons prior to the @entity15 discovery			0
a new strategy document by the @entity143 warned : ‘ we need to develop counter-measures for the imminent risk that @entity117 will facilitate the manufacture of weapons or part of weapons ’			0
in the @entity72 , more than 100,000 plans for a plastic gun known as the ‘ liberator ’ were downloaded within hours			2
the explosion of interest provoked the government into ordering the @entity157 - based company who produced them to take them down			2
it used a 3d printer that cost £ 5,140 from the online auction site @entity163 to make the parts which , when assembled , create a working handgun			1
police have also warned of the danger of guns being ordered over the internet from the @entity72 in @entity171 , police tracked the delivery of a handgun to 15 - year - old boy after it was ordered online			1
the @entity15 raid took place as part of a huge operation to tackle organised criminals linked to drugs , guns and money laundering			1
more than £ 330,000 worth of drugs , counterfeit goods worth £ 2m , £ 25,000 cash and weapons including a taser and a baton have been recovered			0
deadly : what appears to be a sniper rifle equipped with along - sighted lens was recovered during the operation @entity192 : officers also found rifles during the operation			1
at least 100 raids were carried out around the city handgun : pistols and air - rifles were also discovered as police looked to clamp down on organised crime manufacturing : they also found glue , labels and a collection of tools which are alleged to have been used to produce counterfeit goods there are currently more than 160 known organised criminal gangs in @entity15 , costing the local economy between £ 850 million and £ 1.7 billion each year			1
chief constable @entity211 said that 3d printer guns are ‘ a new phenomenon ’			0
he said : ‘ we will really need to look at this new development			0
certainly we feel that we are having success - and the important thing is not to be defeatist about this			0
‘ it is not to think that we ’ll never win that these people are cleverer than us , they are not , they are just more violent than us			0
’ detective @entity32 added : ' this is a really significant discovery for @entity20			1
caught : @entity20 raided a warehouse filled with what are allegedly counterfeit goods ' if what we have seized is proven to be viable components capable of constructing a genuine firearm , then it demonstrates that organised crime groups are acquiring technology that can be bought on the high street to produce the next generation of weapons			1
' in theory , the technology essentially allows offenders to produce their own guns in the privacy of their own home , which they can then supply to the criminal gangs who are causing such misery in our communities			1
' because they are also plastic and can avoid x-ray detection , it makes them easy to conceal and smuggle			2
' these could be the next generation of firearms and a lot more work needs to be done to understand the technology and the scale of the problem			1
' if what we have seized today can , as we suspect , be used to make a genuine firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against this next generation of homemade weapons			2
' i would strongly urge anyone who has information about the whereabouts of a gun in their community to call us			0
' finished product : a fully - assembled plastic gun made by a printer would look similar to this intricate : each of the components would have been made individually in the machine before being put together using nails and household screws risk : in may , @entity280 reporter @entity279 was able to get one of the weapons through security checks and onto the @entity284 the world 's first gun made with 3d printer technology was successfully fired in the @entity72 earlier this year			1
the controversial group who manufactured the gun , @entity288 , group spent a year trying to create the firearm , which was successfully tested at a firing range south of @entity293 , @entity157			0
according to the group 's website @entity288 is a ' non-profit corporation in the state of @entity157 , organised and operated exclusively for charitable and literary purposes '			0
the group says their main aims are : ' to defend the civil liberty of popular access to arms as guaranteed by the @entity302 and affirmed by the @entity303 , through facilitating global access to , and the collaborative production of , information and knowledge related to the 3d printing of arms ; and to publish and distribute , at no cost to the public , such information and knowledge in promotion of the public interest			0
' the gun was made on a 3d printer that cost £ 5,140 from the online auction site @entity319 was assembled from separate printed components made from plastic - only the firing pin was made from metal			1
@entity288 is headed by @entity323 , a 25 - year - old law student at the @entity324 this year mr @entity323 told the @entity325 : ' i think a lot of people were n't expecting that this could be done			0
' mr @entity323 , who describes himself as a crypto - anarchist , said his plans to make the design available were ' about liberty '			2
he told the @entity325 : ' there is a demand of guns - there just is			2
there are states all over the world that say you ca n't own firearms - and that 's not true any more			2
' i 'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want			0
it 's not up to the political players any more			0
" asked if he felt any sense of responsibility about whose hands the gun might fall into , he told the @entity325 : " i recognise the tool might be used to harm other people - that 's what the tool is - it 's a gun			0
' but i do n't think that 's a reason to not do it - or a reason not to put it out there			0
' 3d printing has been hailed as the future of manufacturing			0
