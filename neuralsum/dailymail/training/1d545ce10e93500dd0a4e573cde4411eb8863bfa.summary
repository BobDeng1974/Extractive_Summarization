@entity292 , @entity293 , 3 days ago completely average - that photo was taken in @entity13			2
open an astronomy book and learn what that sky looks like from the southern hemisphere ! @entity299 , surin thailand , 4 days ago bill torbitt , windhoek , 20/9/2013 20:27 @entity302 @entity12 , @entity303 , @entity28 , 4 days ago as the guy who took the winning photo and the @entity276 photo , i always find it amusing to read all the " photoshop fake " comments			1
in fact i think it 's really the biggest compliment that a small minority of people think that images like these would not be possible without photoshop			0
sure there are fakes out there done with photoshop and that really annoys me , but not any of these ones			0
i 'm pretty sure the expert judging panel who selected theses images knows that too			0
as for the guy who thinks he takes better astro photos but does n't have a real understanding of the way the moon looks outside of the @entity48 , i suggest you go have a look at the blog i wrote on a short film i made a month before i actually shot the winning @entity276 image above			0
it has a good explanation on how one goes about getting a shot like this , and some links in there to explain how the moon does look different in other parts of the world			0
since i ca n't post a link , google : full moon silhouettes blog @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity259 , 4 days ago what a beautiful @entity113 we live in ... shame about some of the beings that live in it			0
@entity357 , @entity358 , @entity259 , 4 days ago i have been a ( very ) amateur astronomer for a number of years and to those who doubt the authenticity of the photographs - you need to get out more			0
take a look through a telescope and you will see many of the objects in the photos ; i have			0
i simply lack the skill to do what these photographers have done			0
amazing work , well done to them all			0
@entity374 , @entity375 , @entity259 , 4 days ago far better than a @entity376 ! ! ! bill torbitt , windhoek , 4 days ago a load of over-photoshopped false colour fakes @entity382 , @entity381 , @entity383 , 4 days ago @entity384 ! just @entity384 ! @entity385 , @entity386 , @entity259 , 4 days ago stunning indeed ! congratulations to all the winners and please keep snapping because i love all these photos ! @entity391 , @entity392 , 4 days ago that aurora picture would be even better in @entity394 , and meteors would look good that way too			0
you 'd need two cameras a few miles apart and two people operating them who know what they 're about			0
i wonder who will be first to start doing this ... the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity409			0
