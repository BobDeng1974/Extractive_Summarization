@entity7 said today that @entity8 ' thrilled me to death ' with a solid performance at her @entity13 debut in dressage - an ancient equestrian sport that has been thrust into the political spotlight thanks to mrs @entity7 's partial ownership in the horse			1
the 15 - year - old , @entity19 - bred mare has been the source of political jokes and @entity24 ads questioning how @entity4 @entity26 presidential candidate @entity25 can presume to know the problems of ordinary @entity4 when he inhabits the rarefied world of dressage			2
proud owners : @entity7 , @entity31 and @entity32 applaud after @entity8 's performance in the equestrian dressage competition in @entity35 mrs @entity7 was in the vip section of the equestrian stadium at @entity38 for @entity8 's competition , watching literally from the edge of her seat as the mare completed the 7 - minute @entity44 test			1
she and @entity8 's other two owners gave horse and rider @entity47 a rousing standing ovation and a wave as they left the arena			1
their score of 70.243 per cent put them in 13th place with half the 50 competitors still to go			1
' she was consistent and elegant , ' mrs @entity7 told the @entity0 ' she did not disappoint			1
she thrilled me to death			0

ride on : @entity47 from @entity4 rides @entity8 in the equestrian dressage competition ' she felt really strong and is peaking at the right time , ' he said			1
' she was amped up , a little stronger than usual			0
the trick is to manage that			0
' he said he had n't spoken to mrs @entity7 before the competition - he never does - but said her final words of advice to him were to ' do what you know ( how ) to do , and do what you do best			1
' ' it was a good score			0
overall it was great , ' he said			0
' knowing my three ladies , they 're probably in tears right now , ' he said of mrs @entity7 and co-owners @entity80 and @entity82 , his wife			1
at the halfway point in the first phase of the team dressage competition , @entity83 and @entity19 were vying for gold and the @entity88 and @entity89 for bronze			1

horseman : @entity47 , seen here riding @entity8 , is the husband of the horse 's co-owner @entity82 @entity100 of @entity88 , who won the individual gold in the past three olympic games , trailed in fifth with 73.343 on @entity103 , her partner in 2004 and 2008 and now considered somewhat past his prime but still a solid team horse			1
' the only thing i want now is a good team score , ' said @entity109			0
' i 'm not here for myself but for the team			0
' all 50 riders perform the @entity44 dressage test - half each on thursday and friday			1
they return to perform the harder @entity44 special test on august 7 to determine team medals			1
the highest scoring riders will then move forward to the freestyle competition aug. 9 to decide individual medals			2
the sport is the equine equivalent of ballet			2
a rider , clad in top hat and tails , takes the horse through a series of steps that look like the horse is dancing : twirling pirouettes , prancing trots and the crowd - pleasing ' flying change , ' which looks like the horse is skipping			2
in addition to @entity8 , another athlete grabbed attention at @entity38 on thursday : @entity138 's @entity137 , who became the oldest competitor at the @entity140 when he and his horse @entity141 cantered into the ring			1
the 71 - year - old @entity137 was also the oldest competitor at the @entity144			0
an even greater feat may be that it 's been 48 years since his first @entity13 appearance			1
he competed in equestrian show jumping at the 1964 @entity149			2
' the biggest motivation i have to keep competing is that i feel i am improving , ' @entity150 is currently the second - oldest olympian ever			0
@entity137 will have to wait until 2016 to catch the record - holder - @entity154 of @entity89 - who won a silver medal in shooting in 1920 at age 72			0

the issue has become a campaign sore spot given the tough economic times in the @entity4			0
he is worth as much as $ 250million			0
a topflight dressage horse can cost more than six figures			1
upkeep runs a few thousand dollars a month and transport and competition fees cost tens of thousands			2
the @entity169 own several horses ; @entity7 rides as part of her therapy for multiple sclerosis			2
yet while horse owners may need deep pockets to maintain their dancing steeds , the riders very often come from more modest means			2
@entity47 emigrated from @entity19 in 1984 hoping to find greater financial and professional opportunities in the @entity4 than he could at home			0
that said , the sport does have an aristocratic background			0
