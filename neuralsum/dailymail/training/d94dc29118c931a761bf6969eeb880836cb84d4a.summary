cardinal @entity0 made the comments just a week after @entity2 , the @entity3 , resigned after a succession of affairs promiscuity is wrecking the chances of young people having happy marriages in later life , @entity7 ’s most senior @entity6 said yesterday			1
cardinal @entity0 , the archbishop of @entity13 , said that ‘ casual relationships ’ were wrong because they potentially involved sexual intercourse with a person ’s future spouse			1
they helped to destroy the concept of marriage as a ‘ permanent faithful commitment ’ , the @entity23 said , making it harder for couples to stick together through the bad times as well as the good			1
‘ i do n’t doubt that most young people aspire to having their own family , ’ said @entity0 , who is in @entity27 for the @entity28 on the family , convened by @entity30 to discuss the growing challenges to marriage and family life			1
young people , he continued , seek to have their own family ‘ within the context of a stable relationship between husband and wife , having the family with a sense of permanence and a permanent faithful commitment ’			2
but such aspirations were thwarted by the onset of premature sexual activity , such as casual sex and cohabitation , the @entity23 argued , suggesting that such practices were a direct cause of marital infidelity in later life			1
‘ nobody wants a wife or a husband who is unfaithful , ’ he said , ‘ so what we have to get across to people is that casual relationships before marriage is actually being casual with somebody ’s future husband or wife			1
’ the comments of @entity0 , the leader of the @entity66 , were made during an interview with @entity68 , a @entity69 - based news agency which was filmed and later posted on @entity70			1
but they come at an embarrassing time for the @entity66 in @entity7 as they were made just a week after the @entity30 accepted the resignation of @entity2 , the @entity3 , after a succession of affairs , including one allegedly with a married mother - of - two			1
the woman ’s husband , who hired a private detective to spy on the couple , is threatening to sue the church because he claims it must have known about the bishop ’s affairs but did not act to stop him			1
the @entity23 ’s views are supported however by sociological studies which found that many people who embark on a colourful sexual career were often unable to either find a spouse or sustain a marriage for life			1
they include research from @entity94 which revealed earlier this year that 47 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men aged 20 will never marry			2
research from @entity94 which revealed earlier this year that 47 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men aged 20 will never marry the findings showed a contemporary generational shift away from marriage as couples increasingly cohabit without ever taking the decision to commit			2
@entity103 , however , account for just 19 per cent of parents but 50 per cent of all family breakdown , with just seven per cent of cohabiting couples staying together until a child reaches 15 years			2
such trends reflect a dramatic change in lifestyles compared to the baby - boomer generation , which has seen 87 per cent of men and 92 per cent of women having married at some stage			2
in 1970 , the peak year for marriage , 564,818 men and women aged 25 got married			0
in 2010 , just 56,598 tied the knot , a fall of 90 per cent			0
@entity119 , the sociologist who coined the phrase ‘ marriage lite ’ for cohabitation , said @entity0 was right in his analysis			0
she said that studies from @entity69 have repeatedly shown that people who postpone sexual activity until maturity , or until they at least know their partner well , were more capable of a lasting relationship than those who did not			0
she blamed the propensity to plunge ‘ straight into sex ’ on contraceptive - based sex education and that in the ‘ long run ’ such relationships were comparatively unsuccessful			1
‘ we have abandoned courtship , ’ she continued			0
‘ sex education tells us that it ’s the children ’s choice when they become “ active ” , like a volcano blowing up			1
we have got rid of the rules , all of the rules			0
’ dr @entity119 said it would be better to encourage restraint and said it was also vital that young people were taught about the many distinctions between marriage and cohabitation			0
‘ people increasingly have a series “ shack - ups ” , ’ she said , which were unstable , meaning that women in particular were increasingly leaving it too late to have children			0
‘ some are very upset about it , ’ she added			1
@entity159 , author of @entity160 explained : a guide for parents and children , said that the views of @entity0 were increasingly supported by science			0
she said : ‘ the social and medical sciences can now quantify some of the ways in which pre-marital sexual experiences detract from later marriage			0
‘ through brain scan technology , for instance , we know that sexual experience is such a powerful thing that it alters the physical makeup of the brain for life			2
this is designed to “ glue ” us to our partner			0
’ research by @entity184 of the @entity69 @entity185 put this into perspective , she said			0
‘ a woman who has only ever had one sexual partner has an 80 per cent chance of a successful marriage , ’ said mrs @entity159			0
‘ add in one extra partner , and it falls to 54 per cent , add a second and it drops to 44 per cent			0
’ she added : ‘ one also of course runs the risk of damage to fertility from stds and the use of contraception			2

@entity23 said casual sex meant *sleeping* with a person *'s* future spouse
added that engaging in casual sex made infidelity more likely in later life
