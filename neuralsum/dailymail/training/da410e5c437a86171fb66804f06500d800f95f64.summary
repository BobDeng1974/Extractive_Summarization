the pair , believed to be @entity11 nationals , were detained while trying to enter @entity12 at @entity13			1
mr @entity5 was one of four @entity4 who died when @entity15 gunmen stormed the @entity17 consulate last month			1
remains of the consulate : two @entity11 nationals have been arrested in @entity7 in connection with the attack on the @entity4 consulate in @entity17 ( pictured ) a member of the foreign service and two former @entity27 bodyguards were also killed after terrorists overran the consulate and set fire to it			1
mr @entity5 was the first @entity4 ambassador to die in the line of duty since 1979			2
@entity12 broadcaster @entity34 reported the arrests on its website today			0
the two suspected are believed to have tried to enter the country using fake passports			0
police in @entity7 have declined to comment on the report			0
the terrorist plot stunned @entity4 on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on @entity46 and @entity47 [ caption the consulate , located in the city of @entity17 , was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack , which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the september 11 terror attacks			1
the @entity54 is currently conducting an internal investigation into the @entity17 attack			1
president @entity57 has ordered both the @entity58 and the @entity59 to hunt down the terrorists who attacked the consulate			0
it is unclear what the president plans to do once the perpetrators of the assault in @entity17 are found , but he has mobilised the military 's @entity66 ( @entity66 ) to help carry out the mission			2
@entity66 and the @entity58 teamed up to send @entity27 commandos into @entity70 in 2011 for a raid that killed @entity72			0
the @entity73 plans for retaliation come after it was revealed that security officials missed key signs that the consulate and @entity4 ambassador @entity5 were in danger			1
the @entity80 reported that various whistleblowers have come forward since the attack to testify about prior attacks and a series of threats , which are described in a letter from @entity87 and rep @entity88 to secretary of state @entity90			0
the letter , obtained by the site , says that both the consulate and @entity5 were prime terror targets because threats had been made against both on @entity97			0
one such post mentioned the route that mr @entity5 took on his morning jog , prompting the diplomat to briefly stop running for his own safety the letter also mentions two separate bombings on the consulate - one on april 6 ( when two former security guards hurled improvised explosives at the building ) and another on june 6			2
neither attack resulted in deaths or injuries			0
meanwhile it has been alleged that the @entity54 denied a request from the security team at the @entity4 embassy in @entity6 to retain the services of a @entity118 airplane in the country once commercial flights to the country had been reinstated			1
the information was apparently contained in an email seen by @entity124 - which was copied to mr @entity5			0
it is understood that the plane was used to get staff around @entity6 , not just in and out of the country			0
but the allegation will raise further questions about the level of security support provided to diplomatic staff in @entity6			1
destruction : a man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four @entity4 lives the revelations came as the @entity73 announced it was pulling all @entity4 personnel out of @entity17 , @entity6 's second - largest city			1
@entity54 spokeswoman @entity142 told the @entity143 : ' everybody who was in @entity17 and posted there has been withdrawn			2
' new evidence has suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was involved in the attack , despite initial claims by officials that it was a protest gone wrong			0
mr @entity5 and three other @entity4 - @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 - perished in the assault .			2

@entity11 nationals detained at @entity13 in @entity7
@entity5 was one of four @entity4 killed in attack on @entity4 consulate in @entity17 last month
