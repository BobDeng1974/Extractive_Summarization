by @entity0 published : 03:56 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 15:09 est , 5 july 2013 for more than three - quarters of a century , a four - fingered chocolate bar meant you were eating a @entity4			1
but shoppers could now be offered an alternative after a legal battle over whether the shape of the snack is a trademark			2
@entity11 wanted to register the four - finger @entity4 design in a bid that was resisted by @entity14			1
iconic design : but @entity11 has lost an attempt to trademark the four - fingered shape in the @entity19 however the @entity20 ruled against the @entity22 firm on the grounds that consumers identified @entity4 primarily by their bright red packaging			1
it said the reason the chocolate - covered wafers were divided into fingers was to make them easier to break up and eat , making it a technical issue , rather than one of branding			0
furthermore , the ruling pointed out that the four - finger shape was covered up by the wrapper so any imitator would not confuse consumers			0
this means @entity14 or another competitor could introduce a rival to the @entity4 , first made as the @entity4 in 1935			1
but the ruling is complicated by the fact that @entity11 does have protection for the four - finger design at @entity47 level after defeating another challenge by @entity14			2
a @entity11 spokesman said the firm was considering whether to appeal against the @entity20 decision			0
rival firm @entity14 , maker of @entity52 , said it welcomed the ruling by the @entity20 he said : ‘ @entity4 was launched over 75 years ago and is one of the most iconic shapes of any chocolate bar , recognised around the world			1
' in december last year , @entity11 won a @entity59 ruling on the validity of their @entity59 wide trademark registration for the four - finger @entity4 shape so we are perplexed and disappointed with this national decision by the @entity19 @entity20			1
’ ‘ the @entity19 is the birthplace of @entity4 and we are assessing whether to appeal			1
’ @entity65 , the new name of @entity14 ’s @entity68 owners , welcomed the ruling but said they had no ‘ immediate ’ plans to launch a similar product in the @entity19			1
have a break ... @entity4 was initially called @entity4 and was launched in @entity73 in 1935 initially called @entity4 , the four - fingered wafer crisp was launched in @entity73 and the @entity75 in september 1935			0
renamed @entity77 two years later , it became @entity4 after the @entity78			0
@entity79 is sure where the name @entity4 came from , but its thought @entity73 's famous @entity83 ( aka @entity4 ) club of the 1920s may have been an influence			2
within two years of launch , @entity4 was @entity89 's leading product , a position that has remained unchanged			2
during the @entity78 it was marketed as a valuable wartime food with the slogan ' @entity94 '			0
kitkats have been produced in a red and white wrapper for most of their history apart from a brief spell from 1945 - 47 when it was covered in plain rather than milk chocolate because of a shortage of milk after the war - it then came in a blue wrapper			0
it was first advertised on television in 1957 and the famous ' dancing panda ' advertisement came 30 years later in 1987 , followed by the ' have a break ' series of advertisements in the 1990s			0
the two - fingered @entity4 was launched at the same time as the four - fingered one , and the @entity113 was launched in 1999 .			0

@entity115 rules that the bar 's *distinctive* shape can not be trademarked in @entity19
decision leaves the way clear for @entity14 to launch similar chocolate bar
@entity4 shape already trademarked in the @entity59 , leaving *tricky* legal situation
