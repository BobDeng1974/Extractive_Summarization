the ' @entity0 ' , an ancient human ancestor , donned clothes and may have been an expert fire - builder			1
scientists have built up a remarkable account of what life was like for the early human , who existed between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago			1
they have been studying the @entity9 cave where the @entity0 fossils were first discovered in 1923			1
scientists have re-excavated the cave in the village of @entity14 , near @entity15 , where fossils of early humans , dubbed the @entity0 , were initially found the famous @entity0 skull went missing after in 1941 when it was being transported to the @entity19 from @entity9 during @entity20			1
scientists have revisited the site to discover more details about our ancient ancestor the re-excavation , in the village of @entity14 , near @entity15 , has unearthed fascinating details proving our ancestors were more advanced than previously believed			2
the @entity0 was outfitted , wearing animal hides that had been softened using stone tools			2
belonging to the species @entity31 , the @entity0 was able to make fire , work wood and bizarrely drilled holed in objects for as yet unknown reasons			2
discoveries : a bust of the @entity0 at the @entity39 , @entity15 using powerful microscopes , the scientists are examining tools used by the @entity0 to gain more details about their use			1
scientists from the @entity46 said that a 3,000 - year - old living room , or ' activity floor ' , had been discovered in the cave , containing what could be a fireplace			1
@entity52 , a curator at the @entity53 and a special member of the academy , said that it was also likely the species had attached stone points to sticks , creating spears			0
the discovery could be significant as it shows the @entity0 potentially joining two materials to form a tool			0
the @entity9 cave system is one of the most important palaeolithic sites ever discovered			1
archaeologists unearthed thousands of stone tools and hundreds of fragmentary remains from about 40 early humans as they worked on the site between 1921 and 1966			1
the human remains discovered in the cave were later assigned to the species homo erectus			2
the original fossils of the @entity0 vanished in 1941 as they were being transported to @entity19 at the peak of @entity20 a number of techniques have attempted to accurately date the remains numerous times over the years but have failed to find a definitive answer			1
early discovery : scientists originally found the fossilised remains of the @entity0 in 1923 but only now are they establishing details , such as that the homo erectus species may have been able to build and master fire likeness : scientists at the @entity90 putting muscles on a cast of the @entity0 's face scientists believe the discoveries at the @entity14 cave may finally prove that the @entity0 could control fire despite the low temperatures of northern @entity9			1
the team also believes that the @entity0 was working wood , with the possibility that they were creating wooden tools			2
while the exact details of the dig have not been finalised , the initial findings will fascinate scientists			0
the fossils revealed that the ancestors drilled holes but scientists have no idea what purpose this activity fulfilled			0
the findings may also be significant because of their timing with scientists in @entity118 recently discovered that another early human ancestor was making spears 500,000 years ago			1
similarities : a modern human ( @entity123 ) skull , left , compared with the @entity0 skull ( @entity31 ) , right @entity127 scientist @entity126 and @entity19 colleague @entity128 first arrived in @entity14 in 1921 where they were directed to the site by quarrymen			0
upon arrival at the cave @entity126 announced : ' here is primitive man , now all we have to do is find him			0
' the confidence was well - founded as the scientists had just discovered what would become one of the most important paleontological sites in the world			0
@entity143 found human molars at the site but it was @entity148 scientist @entity147 who made some of the most significant discoveries , despite his initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the world			0
around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the @entity160 invasion			0
fossils were placed in the @entity162 of the @entity163 for safe - keeping , before being packed up for the @entity19 in 1941			0
but the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern @entity9			2
it is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on @entity160 ship the @entity170 in 1945			0
@entity19 financier @entity171 appealed for information on their whereabouts in 1972 , promising a reward of $ 5,000			0
one woman made contact , demanding $ 500,000 , but this failed to materialise			0
the @entity9 government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of @entity20 .			1

scientists are re-excavating @entity9 cave to examine ancient human tools
the @entity0 was first discovered in the cave in 1923 - and lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago
but crucial fossils were lost during @entity20 so new details are *emerging*
revealed the early humans may have mastered fire and built spears
