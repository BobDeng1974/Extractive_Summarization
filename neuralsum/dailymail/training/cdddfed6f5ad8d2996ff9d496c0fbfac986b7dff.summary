by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's @entity2 was forced to settle for a silver medal in the women 's squash final at the @entity7 in @entity8 after a dominant display by @entity11 world number one @entity12			1
@entity2 , who was crowned world champion earlier this year after @entity14 had been beaten in the semi-final on the other side of the draw , rued a missed opportunity at game point in the opener as @entity14 ran out a 12 - 10 11 - 2 11 - 5 winner			1
the 30 - year - old @entity2 had made a strong start , building an 8 - 4 lead in the opener before @entity14 hit back , and the favourite surged through the second set with the minimum of difficulty			1
gold : @entity12 ( left ) celebrates at match point as she beats @entity2 there was more pain in the third set for @entity2 , who needed treatment after being accidentally hit by a @entity14 back - swing when she trailed 4 - 3			1
@entity14 , who has won seven of the last nine world titles and reigned as world number one for 99 months , took a stroke which put her 5 - 3 up and it was a lead the @entity11 never looked like relinquishing as she completed a successful defence of her title			2
second : @entity2 was forced to settle for a silver medal in the women 's squash final @entity2 said : ' i think @entity12 was better			1
obviously she was - she won and i did n't			2
' i definitely think the first game was the most crucial and i was disappointed not to convert that game ball that i had			0
things like that can turn matches			0
after that she settled down very well and it was always going to be difficult then			0
' physically and mentally she 's tough to break down			2
you 've got no chance if you 're not playing the best you could and i would n't say i was at my best today ( monday )			0
it was 3 - 0 and it was n't really close after the first game			2
ultimately my goal was to try and get a medal and i never put a colour on it			0
a silver is probably about what i deserved			0
i 'm number two in the world and that performance was n't good enough for the gold			0
' beaten : @entity2 plays a shot during her defeat by @entity14 in the women 's gold medal match			1
