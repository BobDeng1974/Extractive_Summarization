you had to be impressed by @entity2 ’s performance at @entity3 on wednesday night			1
their intent was clear from the start and they finally began to look like a team with authority in @entity10			2
i ’ve questioned why they persist with two up front in @entity10 games			2
although they were forced into the change , with @entity18 injured , they looked much better with @entity19 and @entity20 sitting in midfield and just one up front			0
it was just what was needed for that game			0
@entity26 ( left ) started up front on his own in @entity2 's 2 - 0 @entity30 win at @entity3 @entity31 was outstanding			1
sometimes he does n’t dominate games but with @entity18 and @entity33 not playing and @entity34 not starting , he rose to the challenge			0
maybe he feels a little bit in the shadow of those players but he played like a leader			2
it was a wonderful performance and @entity41 must be delighted			0
now they ’re in the last 16 of the @entity30 , they ’ll have confidence to grow and progress			1
and at least they ca n’t get @entity47 in the next round			0
@entity31 ( centre ) starred for @entity2 , scoring the opener in wednesday 's win at the @entity52 read more from @entity53 on @entity54			1

@entity2 won 2 - 0 at @entity3 in the @entity30 on wednesday
result means @entity2 *qualified* for the last 16 of the *competition*
city played *brilliant* in a 4 - 5 - 1 formation at the @entity52
