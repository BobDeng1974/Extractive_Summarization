a high - altitude research facility that became the coldest of @entity3 relics has opened to curious tourists after decades of secrecy			0
the massive @entity6 was designed under the direction of bouncing bomb inventor sir @entity8 in 1946			1
researchers used the unique laboratory to test aircraft in frigid conditions experienced at 70,000ft – the target altitude for a new supersonic plane designed by sir @entity8			1
the massive @entity6 was designed under the direction of bouncing bomb inventor sir @entity8 in 1946 a large refrigeration plant supplied extremely cold methane liquid to ‘ coolers ’ at the four corners of each of the air circulation ducts @entity24 researchers prepare to test a jet aircraft inside the @entity6 at @entity26 in this undated photo the 50ft long research facility was large enough to hold the fuselage and cockpit of a large plane or a helicopter while replicating temperatures as low as -60c and an air density one - twentieth of that at ground level			1
it was even used to find out how cold weather affects naval guns and tanks			1
in the 1960s researchers performed extreme weather testing on pressure cabins for the @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 passenger airliners before they came into service			0
researchers used the unique laboratory to test sir @entity8 ' designs for new supersonic aircraft in frigid conditions experienced at 70,000ft the 25ft wide chamber was also used for testing @entity57 fishing trawlers while reproducing some of the coldest temperatures on @entity59 the 50ft long research facility replicated temperatures as low as -60c and was even used to find out how cold weather affects naval guns and the test subjects went beyond aircraft			1
at one point the 25ft wide chamber was used for testing @entity57 fishing trawlers while reproducing some of the coldest temperatures on @entity59			2
researchers recreated blizzards to help find out why so many of the vessels sunk in @entity72 conditions			0
according to the museum , a large refrigeration plant supplied extremely cold methane liquid to ‘ coolers ’ at the four corners of each of the air circulation ducts			0
the 340 - ton secretive structure was in operation until 1980 and then mothballed at the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 thanks to a £ 120,000 grant bosses at the museum have overhauled the chamber and opened it up to the public for the first time the 340 - ton secretive structure was in operation until 1980 and then mothballed at the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 , where sir @entity8 oversaw the @entity93			1
but thanks to a £ 120,000 grant from the @entity99 ’s @entity98 , bosses at the museum have overhauled the chamber and opened it up to the public for the first time			0
in the 1960s researchers performed extreme weather testing on pressure cabins for the @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 passenger airliners a sea cat missile launcher ( left ) was tested inside the chamber , which was connected to a labyrinth of refrigeration pipes ( right ) this diagram shows the individual components of the @entity6 constructed from the hull of a nuclear submarine visitors can also get a look inside the extraordinary facility ’s elevated control room and refrigeration / vacuum plant			2
@entity119 , director of the museum , said : ‘ until now the museum has not had the resources to restore and properly interpret this unique research facility			0
‘ this restoration and the finished exhibition is wonderful tribute not only to our staff and volunteers but also to @entity8 and his team who created and utilised this extraordinary chamber			2

@entity6 was designed under the direction of bouncing bomb inventor sir @entity8 in 1946
research used the laboratory to test aircraft in frigid conditions experienced at 70,000ft
it was also used to study *effects* of cold weather on naval guns , tanks and fishing trawlers
