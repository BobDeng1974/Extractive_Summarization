by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 15:10 est , 28 february 2013 it could be a scene from multimillion dollar @entity3 blockbuster @entity2 , with daredevil pilots flying in the face of danger and fierce explosions			2
but these scorching snaps were not taken on a film set , they were captured at the @entity12 , where crowds were left feeling the heat by the red hot stunts being performed in the skies above them			1
in a sight reminiscent of the @entity21 epic , when @entity23 jets leave a trail of flames behind them as they dose the jungle with napalm , the dynamic @entity18 aerobatics display team packed a real punch with its state - of - the - art pyrotechnics			1
the breathtaking act at @entity57 near @entity58 in @entity59 involved multiple head on passes and up to a dozen explosions , and was performed in the country for the first time yesterday			1
ms @entity51 , who flies a brightly painted edge 540 and was the youngest ever woman to be part of the @entity49 unlimited aerobatics team , said : ' the show is a mix of precision aerobatics , head on sequences and tight passes , all while surrounded by smoke and balls of fire			1
' the feeling when the race finishes at the end and @entity50 and i cross as the wall of fire goes off is pretty tough to compare to anything else on earth			2
if the audience is having half the fun that we are having , then they are going to go home wanting more			0
' ' i love the smell of napalm in the morning ' : the scene from @entity2 when @entity49 jets leave a trail of flames behind as they cover the jungle with napalm breathtaking : the aerobatics at @entity57 involved head on passes and up to a dozen explosions , and was performed in the country for the first time yesterday top team : @entity106 comprises @entity49 stunt pilots @entity50 and @entity51 , along with the pyrotechnic wizardry of @entity53 airshow organisers also arranged for the @entity110 to show off one of its newest planes by staging a mid-air refueling demonstration			1

@entity124 pilot , flying officer @entity127 , explained how the @entity129 links to a ' basket ' at the end of a hose being dragged along by the tanker			0
he said it is the most demanding skill in non-combat flying			0
he told @entity135 : ' it 's the other extreme of fighter flying			2
it ’s a really slow deliberate process , obviously you want to be really smooth around the tanker not to make anyone nervous and get into the basket nice and safely			0
military might : a @entity124 comes within a few metres of the @entity146 @entity145 's @entity144 multi-role tanker ahead of an impressive refueling demonstration @entity148 for heights : the refueling exercise happened 15,000ft in the air , with one flying officer explaining how it is the most demanding skill in non-combat flying ' it ’s the one role we ca n’t train for in the simulator so the only way we get better is spending more time behind the basket			1
