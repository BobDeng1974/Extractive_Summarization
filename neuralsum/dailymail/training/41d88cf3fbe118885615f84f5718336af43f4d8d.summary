a district attorney has today decided not to file criminal charges against a man who fatally shot his 7 - year - old son outside a western @entity5 gun store			1
@entity7 district attorney @entity6 announced he would n't charge @entity8 , 44 , of @entity9 , with carrying a firearm without a license			1
@entity6 said he considered the charge , a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison , because @entity8 's gun was loaded when he put it in his truck moments before the gun fired on december 8 , killing his son , @entity17			1
the boy had been buckling himself into his safety seat in his father 's truck when the handgun , which was placed on the truck 's console , fired as @entity8 got into the front seat , police said			1
tragic : a @entity5 father accidentally shot his 7 - year - old son , @entity17 , while he got into his truck in the parking lot of a western @entity5 gun store			1
he discovered he will not face charges today accident : @entity34 , 44 , shot the boy in the chest			1
all charges against him were dropped today @entity8 had removed the magazine from the pistol but did n't realize there was still a round in the chamber when he tried to sell the 9mm pistol at @entity46 's @entity45 in @entity47 , about 60 miles northwest of @entity48 , police said			1
when the sale did n't go through , @entity8 brought the gun back to the truck , where it accidentally fired			1
@entity6 said in a statement that the evidence " shows that mr. @entity8 recognized that he could not carry a loaded firearm in his vehicle and believed he unloaded the firearm at home before taking it to the dealer to attempt to sell it and another weapon			2
" only people with a license to carry a concealed weapon may keep a loaded gun in their vehicle , said the statement			2
@entity6 said his investigation determined that @entity8 stored the gun at home in a locked location , separate from the magazine , from which @entity8 unloaded the bullets before taking the gun with him to sell that day			2
@entity8 had stored the gun that way since he last shot it over the summer			2
sorrow : ' i know that little kid was everything to him , ' a friend of the father 's told a local paper about the dad 's relationship with his 7 - year - old son , @entity17 , pictured , at the time unthinkable : @entity8 was questioned by state police about the shooting death of his son , @entity17 , pictured			1
police said the father was cooperative and distraught and all charges were dropped today @entity8 " only owned the weapon for the past two years and rarely practiced with it , " @entity6 said tuesday in the statement			1
" he had failed to clear the chamber of the cartridge that caused his son 's death the last time he had fired the pistol and did not do so when he picked it up months later and took it to sell			0
" @entity6 said he still could have filed the unlicensed firearm charge because of @entity108 's " lack of understanding , practice and / or training " about how he should have properly stored the firearm , but he decided not to because @entity8 " had a mistaken but good faith belief that he had properly secured and stored the firearm unloaded in his home and his belief was the proximate cause of the death of his son and not that he was carrying the firearm in his vehicle			1
" @entity8 does not have a listed home telephone number and did not immediately return a call to a cellphone number obtained wednesday by @entity122			0
@entity6 declined to comment beyond his statement , which stressed his belief in a constitutional right to own firearms			0
' i own a number myself , ' the statement said			0
' further , with the reduction of public safety forces firearms ownership may be becoming more necessary			0
' persons who make the decision to own a firearm for personal protection must realize that their primary purpose in owning the firearm is to kill someone or something			0
they have an obligation to know how the firearm works not just on the day they purchase it but on every occasion that they touch it and always remembering its purpose			0
' @entity8 and @entity17 ’s mother were divorced and the 44 - year - old father had custody of the child over the weekend			2
' i know that little kid was everything to him , ' @entity150 , a friend and co-worker of @entity8 ’s at @entity152 in @entity153 , told the @entity157 at the time			0
' he was a wonderful little kid			0
he was full of life , a lot of fun , ' @entity150 said			0
