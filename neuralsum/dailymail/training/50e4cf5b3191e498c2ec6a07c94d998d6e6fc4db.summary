the incident has harmed relations between @entity4 and the @entity2 and ' all efforts have to be done to avoid such incident in the future ' , @entity9 said on thursday , warning it also had hurt the trust @entity4 had in foreign forces			1
the night - time killings in @entity92 on sunday have raised questions about @entity82 strategy in @entity4 and intensified calls for the withdrawal of foreign combat troops			1
the @entity20 decision to suspend the talks was a blow to @entity11 hopes of a negotiated settlement to the war , which has cost the @entity2 $ 510 billion and the lives of over 1,900 soldiers			1
@entity7 left @entity4 shortly after his meeting with @entity9 following his two day visit the attempted suicide bomber apparently stole a truck from a @entity39 soldier after injuring the soldier in a struggle , then drove onto the runway			1
he crashed into a ditch , then seems to have set himself on fire and fought with @entity11 troops , who managed to tackle him and put out the fire			0
the incident has raised disturbing questions over security at the base			0

what 's the big deal ? secretary @entity7 wore a big smile as he set foot at @entity56 the man then drove to the runway at around the same time as mr @entity7 was landing in an @entity142 aeroplane			2
after his truck crashed , he jumped out of the vehicle and appeared to be on fire - although , contrary to earlier reports , the car did not blow up , nor was there any sign of explosives on board			2
' for reasons that are totally unknown to us at this time , our personnel discovered that he was ablaze , ' @entity152 spokesman @entity151 said			0
the man was carrying lighter fluid and matches inside the vehicle , according to @entity159 , suggesting that he may have deliberately set himself alight			0
despite being on fire , the man fought with @entity2 soldiers and even jumped on to the side of their vehicle			2
@entity165 ? the blast came as @entity2 mr @entity7 ( second right ) was arriving at @entity56 meeting : mr @entity7 addresses coalition troops at @entity56 soon after the apparent attack mr @entity151 added : ' base personnel put the fire out and he was immediately treated for burn injuries and is still being treated			1
he sustained considerable burn wounds			0
' mr @entity7 and his entourage were unharmed , although their plane was diverted to another runway to unload - and @entity152 officials said they had no evidence that the timing of the apparent attack was linked to the defense secretary 's visit			1
' we do n't have any indication right now that this was meant as a threat to the secretary ' , said a spokesman			0
' as a fact we do n't have any indication that the driver knew who was coming in on that aircraft			0
' a @entity56 spokesman added : ' procedures were put in place to account for the whereabouts of all military and civilian personnel and , to achieve this , movement within @entity56 was restricted			0
' arrival : mr @entity7 touches down in @entity4 after his plane was diverted to another runway departure : major @entity206 shields himself from rotor wash from mr @entity7 's helicopters @entity211 police patrolled roads inside the base today in the wake of the incident			1
flights and movements in and out were restricted throughout the afternoon while it was investigated and were lifted later on			0
former @entity2 vice president @entity219 cancelled a @entity221 speaking appearance because of security concerns sparked by demonstrations during a visit he made to @entity226 last year			2
mr @entity219 was scheduled to talk about his experiences in office and the current @entity2 political situation at the @entity230 on april 24			2
but @entity231 of @entity232 said on monday that mr @entity219 and his daughter @entity233 had cancelled through their agent			0
' after speaking with their security advisers , they changed their mind on coming to the event , ' mr @entity231 said			0
he added they had ' decided it was better for their personal safety they stay out of @entity221			0
' last september 26 , mr @entity219 was forced to stay holed up in the @entity246 for seven hours before it was deemed safe for him to leave			0
demonstrators blocked the entrances and at one point scuffled with police			0
critics of mr @entity219 take issue with his endorsement of water boarding and sleep deprivation against detainees while serving in former president @entity259 's administration			0
@entity260 is home to a large contingent of @entity2 troops as well as @entity39 forces			2
the blast came as mr @entity7 meet with troops , commanders and @entity4 government officials			1
in a highly unusual move , earlier today around 200 @entity2 @entity269 were told to leave their weapons outside a tent where @entity2 defence secretary @entity7 was set to give a talk			1
officials said the order was because there were two dozen unarmed @entity4 soldiers in attendance and everyone should be treated the same			2
they also denied it was related to sunday 's shooting			0
' you 've got one of the most important people in the world in the room , ' maj. gen. @entity282 told reporters at @entity289			0
' this is not a big deal			0
' the move was unusual as in combat zones marines are usually instructed to have their weapons within close range			0
one military official in @entity297 told @entity298 ' it sends the wrong message ' that marines ca n't be trusted in the presence of the secretary of defense			0
mr @entity7 's visit was planned months ago , long before the weekend slaughter by a rogue @entity2 soldier that claimed the lives of 16 villagers , including women and children			1
it also comes on the same day it emerged the @entity2 soldier who massacred 16 @entity4 civilians was caught on surveillance video â€“ showing him walking up to his base , laying down his weapon and raising his arms in surrender			1
an @entity4 official said that the @entity2 showed @entity4 authorities the surveillance video to prove that only one perpetrator was involved in the sunday shootings , an account which has been disputed			1
the trip propels mr @entity7 into the centre of escalating @entity327 anger and sets the stage for some difficult discussions with @entity4 leaders			1
mr @entity7 , who has said the rogue soldier could face the death penalty , told @entity4 officials that recent violence will not deter the @entity2 from carrying out its mission in @entity4			1
the trip is the first significant visit from a @entity2 dignitary since the killings , which many had worried would spark another wave of deadly riots like those that followed the burning of @entity346 at a @entity2 base last month			2
nearly a week of violent demonstrations and attacks left more than 30 dead , including six @entity2 soldiers killed apparent reprisal attacks			2
six @entity39 soldiers also died last week when their armoured vehicle was blown up attack : the incident happened at the main @entity39 base in @entity4 , @entity56 disbelief : two grief - stricken @entity4 men look into the van where the body of a badly burned child is wrapped in a blue blanket following the shooting last weekend military commanders have yet to release their final investigation on the @entity346 burnings , which @entity2 officials say was a mistake			1
five @entity2 service members could face disciplinary action in connection with the incident			2

' when it comes to the protection of civilian populations , i have been very vocal here and all around the world , not only in @entity4 , ' @entity380 told a group of reporters			2
' we will continue to urge all authorities and military personnel who are engaging in these operations to pay extreme and utmost care to protect the civilian population			0
