a revitalised @entity0 owes his eventful @entity2 career to a stand - out performance at @entity4 – the ground he returns to on sunday carrying the @entity6 hopes of @entity7 on his broad shoulders			1
@entity0 was a 20 - year - old with @entity9 when his outstanding display against @entity11 in a 2008 @entity6 qualifier persuaded @entity13 to buy him 19 days later for a club record £ 15million			1
he became a cult hero at @entity16 for the next five years before signing for @entity7 in 2013			1
now in his second season at @entity18 and used mainly as a striker by @entity20 , he is in the best form of his @entity7 career and scored and made an assist in last weekend 's 3 - 0 victory against @entity25			1
@entity0 fired @entity7 into the lead against @entity25 with a smart finish the @entity29 trains ahead of @entity7 's crucial clash with @entity31 on sunday , where he is sure to be involved @entity0 has grown from a bit - part player last season to become a vital member of @entity20 's squad @entity37 , assistant - manager to @entity38 at @entity13 and @entity7 and who worked with @entity0 at both clubs , recounts how it all began			1
' @entity0 had been on @entity13 's radar for a while			1
his ability to play in different positions was attractive because the club did n't have the money to pay big fees on several players , ' explains @entity37			0
' @entity38 asked me to go and watch him play @entity31 at @entity4 and he was very impressive			1
a lot of players would have been dominated in midfield by someone like @entity11 in his own stadium but @entity0 competed and gave as good as he got			1
he was n't overawed and you could see he had ability			0
' when @entity38 asked my opinion , it was positive and the club signed him in what was a big deal for them given their finances at the time			1
' former @entity13 assistant @entity37 watched @entity0 play against @entity31 for former club @entity9 @entity37 gave the midfielder a glowing reference to @entity38 who sanctioned a £ 15m deal to sign him @entity0 became one of the most instantly - recognisable figures in the @entity72 game with his huge hair making him appear even bigger than his 6ft4ins frame			1
he became a fearsome threat in the air though opponents often felt he was too aggressive with his elbows and it has to be pointed out the @entity29 has received 56 yellow cards and two reds since he moved to @entity82			2
having worked closely with @entity0 , @entity37 says there is far more to his game than the 27 - year - old is given credit for			2
' he is technically very good , he may not have the same range of passing as @entity11 but he rarely gives the ball away			2
and his chest control is as good as anyone i 've seen in the game			0
he can play three positions well ; holding midfield , number 10 or up top , where we used him with @entity97 in the season we reached the @entity100 final			0
i think he is best in a more advanced position where he has more freedom and not as much defensive responsibilities			0
@entity104 ( left ) was assistant to @entity38 at @entity13 and then @entity7 @entity0 became a cult hero at @entity16 , where he spent five seasons ' @entity0 can hold the ball up and bring others into play and i can see why @entity110 enjoyed playing with him , in a similar way that @entity112 benefitted from @entity114 's physical presence for @entity82			1
' a protracted transfer from @entity13 to @entity7 was finally completed in the summer of 2013 for £ 27million after @entity38 and @entity37 had been appointed at @entity18 to begin the @entity118 @entity117 era			1
' i remember @entity119 warning us that @entity7 can take some getting used to for new signings			2
he sited the example of @entity123 who turned out to be a great player for the club			0
@entity119 said he was taken off after 45 minutes of his debut against @entity128 because it was such a culture shock			0
' @entity0 is a humorous guy , always able to take fun out of himself			2
but i guess being the only signing of that transfer window brought its own pressure and looking back maybe he was a bit quieter at the beginning than he was at @entity13			2
but that 's also natural when you are joining a new club with players who have been successful			0
' @entity0 followed @entity38 to @entity7 , but was considered a figure of fun after the disappointing season under the former @entity13 boss @entity0 starred in the 3 - 0 win over @entity31 at @entity18 in december , and offers @entity145 an alternative after a nightmare first season in which @entity7 finisehd seventh , @entity38 was sacked and @entity37 left too			1
@entity0 stayed but was regarded at that time as a figure of fun			2
@entity104 is not surprised he has been able to turn his fortunes around			0
' i always thought he would show people what he could do at @entity7			2
it 's like @entity119 said , it can take a few months for a new signing to be comfortable			0
he has always worked hard in training , he does n't hide when things are n't going well			0
' it 's hard to say what will happen at @entity7 next			0
the pressure is always on to win matches and you do n't know what the manager will do in the summer			0
but @entity0 has shown this season he is an asset to @entity7			1
' and at lunchtime on sunday , he will hope to show that at @entity4 , the ground where it all started for him			0
the only thing he 'd like to change is the result – seven years ago , @entity31 edged @entity9 1 - 0 with an injury - time winner from @entity177 .			0

@entity0 joined @entity13 from @entity9 in 2008 for £ 15m
a performance against @entity11 convinced the @entity13 to buy him
@entity0 followed @entity38 to @entity7 in 2013
the @entity29 has become a *key* player for @entity7 this season
