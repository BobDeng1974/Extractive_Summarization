@entity16 's ( right ) 11 - year - old daughter @entity17 ( left ) was fined $ 50 for using the bathroom students at @entity9 in @entity10 , south - west @entity11 , have been punished for using the bathroom during lesson time ' i found out about it a couple of weeks ago via a @entity32 parents @entity30 site , ' ms @entity16 told @entity33			1
' there were a huge number of parents in uproar			0
' the school has been fully aware of this for quite some time now			2
' ms @entity16 said children had been wetting themselves in class and had to be sent home for changes of clothes , while others had to record their bathroom breaks on class whiteboards			1
' when kids are that age they like to do the right thing , so if a teacher says they ca n't go they 're going to hold and hold and hold , ' she said			0
' i have n't had to worry about [ my daughter ] having an accident , she 's 11 , but my worry is she 's going to end up with a urinary tract infection or something along those lines			0
' she has to write up the time she went to toilet and what time she came in , so her name goes up on whiteboard for 29 other children to see			2
parents have expressed their outrage after learning that students were fined and kept in during recess if they went to the toilet during class ' each child 's toileting record is up for public display - i 'd love to see how an adult would react to that in the workplace			1
' ms @entity16 said a parent who was also a school council member agreed to raise the issue at a meeting more than a week ago , but says it was ' brushed off '			0
' a number of parents went to individual classroom teachers who again have brushed it off , ' she said			0

' of course , our students are free to go to the toilet whenever they need â€” and we would never stop a child from going to the toilet during class time , or penalise them for doing so , ' ms @entity94 told the @entity104 ' a small number of classes have deducted points earned in the ' earn and learn ' system as a way to discourage children from using the toilet during class time			2
' as this does not fit in with our positive approach , this no longer occurs at our school			0
