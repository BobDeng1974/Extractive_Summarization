by @entity1 reporter published : 18:14 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 03:27 est , 11 may 2012 two in five new mothers have struggled to cope with the demands of parenting during the first few weeks after birth , with a similar amount admitting getting ' angry ' with their baby , according to a poll			2
a further one in five were frequently very upset at their child 's crying during the first eight weeks , a survey by the @entity11 has found			1
almost three - quarters ( 72 per cent ) of new mothers wanted more professional advice before their baby was born , on subjects such as how to deal with anxiety , fear and depression , the effects of their own sleep deprivation and how to cope with their baby 's crying and sleeplessness			2
struggle : two in five new mothers have struggled to cope in the weeks following their child 's birth , with a similar amount admitting getting ' angry ' with their baby ( picture posed by model ) two in five of the mothers polled by @entity37 on behalf of the charity either find it fairly difficult or very difficult to cope with the demands of looking after their newborn baby			2
there was also a marked difference between the number of ante - natal classes attended by well - off parents compared with those from a more disadvantaged background			2
the @entity11 called on the government to ensure sufficient resources are available to ' provide the services babies and their families need '			1
mothers need better support in dealing with the ' emotional turmoil ' of looking after a young child , according to @entity57 , the charity 's head of strategy and development for children under one			0
' currently much of the focus of antenatal education is on physical health , such as the choice of pain relief during labour , ' he said			0
the @entity11 study found that women from better backgrounds were more likely to attend antenatal classes ' however , we want both mothers and fathers to have access to high - quality antenatal education on the practicalities of caring for a baby that prepares parents for the emotional challenges they will face			1
' this will help them cope with the impact it will have on their life , their relationships and their own well - being and assist them in being the best parents they can be			0
' we appreciate times are tough financially but failing to provide vital support to new mums is a false economy			1
damage done at this stage of their lives can prevent them reaching their full potential which also has a knock - on effect on society as a whole			0
' babies who are not well cared for are more likely to struggle at school and to have behavioural and relationship problems in later life			1
' the online poll of 516 women with babies aged under one finds that around three - fifths ( 57 per cent ) ' felt isolated with no one to turn to '			1
while two - thirds of new mothers from well - off families attended antenatal classes , less than two - fifths of less well - off mums had done so			1
@entity125 , founder of the @entity127 parenting website , said the first few weeks of a baby 's life are vital for their development but ' can turn a mother 's life upside down '			0
' lack of sleep , isolation and loneliness and the fear they are not mothering in the right way can combine to make new mums feel distraught , ' she said			0
' many women who have been cared for throughout pregnancy can feel abandoned after the initial euphoria of the birth has worn off			0
but this is often the time they need most support			0
