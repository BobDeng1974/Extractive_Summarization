behind bars : speaking today , recorder @entity191 said @entity2 ( pictured ) had targeted at least two of his victims for their vulnerability ' clearly he was convicted in the name of @entity37 and tried to make a fresh start and so the opportunity to move on again and forward is going to be the rug pulled from underneath his feet			2
' it ’s all very unhappily part and parcel of the same course of conduct			0
these were individuals who came across the defendant in his line of work			0
the defendant was dealing with these individuals as part and parcel of his job			0
' this is not someone who has been trawling the internet			0
this is someone who in a very privileged role as a police officer , came into contact with these individuals			0
' sentencing @entity2 , recorder @entity191 said at least two of the former policeman 's victims had been targeted for their vulnerability			2
he told @entity226 : ' you targeted them and preyed upon them knowing they were highly vulnerable individuals			0
you used your uniform and police car to give authority to your presence			1
' he added : ' the vast majority of us are taught from an early age that if you are in danger , difficulty or in trouble , we should turn to a police officer to go and get help			0
' policing is conducted by consent and that consent depends entirely on trust			0
it ’s your conduct and conduct of this type that drives a complete coach and horses through that trust , destroying the relationship between police and the people they seek to serve			0
' speaking after the case , @entity8 detective superintendent @entity256 said @entity2 ' abused the trust that was placed in him as a police officer ' by committing ' a number of very serious offences '			1
