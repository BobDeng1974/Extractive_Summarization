details have emerged of a regime of ' enforced happiness ' at @entity3 , where staff earning little more than the minimum wage are monitored to ensure they are relentlessly cheerful behind the counter			1
the bizarre ' emotional labour ' rules mean employees of the popular sandwich chain are expected to be ' charming ' , to ' have presence ' , and to ' care about other people 's happiness ' , and should never be ' moody ' , or ' just here for the money '			1
mystery shoppers visit branches every week to ensure all staff are displaying ' @entity22 ' behaviour			1
@entity3 perfect ! the ideal employee ' cares about other people 's happiness ' and is not ' just here for the money ' , according to a list of @entity3 ' behaviours ' that has been removed from the chain 's website while ' friendly ' and tactile employees who high - five colleagues as encouragement and ' create a sense of fun ' would be welcomed by the chain , @entity3 does not want to see a team - member who does n't interact with others or ' minces words '			1
the firm 's chief executive , @entity42 , has previously said that whenever he visits a @entity3 branch the first thing he checks is whether staff are touching one another , declaring : ' i can almost predict sales on body language alone '			2
ceo : @entity42 has said he checks to see whether staff are touching each other when he visits @entity3 branches if staff at a @entity3 branch get a positive report after a visit from a mystery shopper , the whole team gets a bonus			1
but should the visitor encounter an employee who is insufficiently ' enthusiastic ' , or worse , ' bad - tempered ' , everybody misses out			1
details of the chain 's list of ' @entity3 perfect ' behaviours emerged online after an essay in the @entity70 exposed its reliance on ' affective ' or emotional labour , a term used to describe work carried out with the aim of producing a - usually positive - emotional response in a person			2
it flagged up the list of more than 50 ' behaviours ' drawn up by the chain as part of its efforts to ensure its staff make customers feel good when they visit a store			2
it appears the list , which included 17 things @entity3 ' do n't want to see ' , 18 they ' want to see ' , and 17 under the heading ' @entity3 perfect ! ' , has since been taken down from the firm 's website			0
@entity3 said its guidelines are for internal use only			0
a spokesman for @entity3 said : ' the reason guidelines are not published on the website is that they are for internal use for staff and the website is an external facing platform for communications with customers			2
' @entity3 's policy also raised eyebrows in the @entity110 , where another blog post on @entity112 said of the list : ' @entity3 does n't merely want its employees to lend their minds and bodies ; it wants their souls too			0
' @entity3 came under scrutiny after an employee who was sacked from the branch at @entity121 , near @entity122 , towards the end of last year , for making homophobic comments towards a colleague			0
@entity126 appealed , claiming the real reason he was fired was because he had spearheaded the establishment of an independent union for @entity3 workers			0
' this member of staff was dismissed for bullying and homophobic behaviour , ' said @entity3 spokesman @entity135			0
' he went through the appeals process and it was decided in @entity3 's favour			0
' mr @entity135 pointed out that the independent union for @entity3 workers , @entity140 , had fewer than ten members , and added that employees were free to join any union they chose			0
he said the practice of sending mystery shoppers to visit @entity3 branches was well - established			1
' they send people to go into each shop and make sure that customers are being looked after , ' he said			0
he added that it was a way of giving @entity3 staff cash incentives to provide good customer service .			1
