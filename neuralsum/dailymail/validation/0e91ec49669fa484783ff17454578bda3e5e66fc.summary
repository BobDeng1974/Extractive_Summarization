here 's the scene : my husband @entity1 is desperately ill and i 'm sitting by his hospital bed			1
he 's been sick for weeks and at one stage i was told he was expected to die			1
he 's now out of a coma and no longer , thank @entity6 , one of the ten sickest people in the vast teaching hospital			1
but still no one knows what 's wrong with him			1
he 's been moved from the intensive care unit into a small room when suddenly a consultant descends			1
@entity14 says that while with her sick husband @entity1 in hospital a consultant with hostile body language came crashing in and started talking down to them as she gave the diagnosis she crashes through the door , followed by half a dozen of her juniors , who crowd round the bed and wait for her to speak			1
no one 's in any doubt who 's in charge			1
she talks not at us , but down to us , like some reincarnation of the monstrous sir @entity31 ( played by @entity33 ) from the @entity31 films			1
except this is n't funny			1
@entity1 has been in hospital for more than a month , but how or why he got ill so suddenly no one really knows			1
one minute i was wondering whether he just had man flu ; the next he was delirious with fever and dreadful abdominal pains , and being rushed to hospital in an ambulance			1
just 48 hours later , he was in a drug - induced coma with sepsis , a life - threatening condition triggered by an infection , his organs shutting down one by one			1
when he was admitted , his symptoms suggested pancreatitis - where the pancreas becomes inflamed			1
i want to know if the doctors are any the wiser about what caused his body to go into free fall			1
@entity14 accompanied @entity1 as he was rushed to hospital in an ambulance , and shortly after was in a drug - induced coma with sepsis so , looking up at the sea of faces , i ask : ' was it pancreatitis that started this ? ' i remain sitting , because if i stand , @entity1 - who is unable to speak for himself as he has a tube in his windpipe - will feel even more helpless			1
' yes , ' the consultant declares haughtily , ' he presented with similar symptoms			1
' ' but was it actually pancreatitis ? ' she repeats herself impatiently : ' yes , he presented with similar symptoms			1
' her hostile body language is telling me to shut up and know my place			1
i try again , but still she answers like a politician , repeating the same refrain			1
then she shuffles her notes and says that another consultant is coming to discuss a kidney tumour that showed up on a scan			1
' no one mentioned a tumour			2
' ' yes , they did			2
' ' no , they did n't			2
' ' yes , they did			2
' for a moment we are in panto territory with someone whose life is hanging by a thread lying terrified between us			2
i 'm torn between bursting into tears and storming into the corridor to tell those junior doctors that if they learn one thing today , it 's how not to talk to the sick and their loved ones			1
patient 's relative meets doctors : it 's a scene repeated daily in hospitals all over the country			2
you can guarantee the next of kin are frightened and exhausted			2
life and death are routine for medical staff , but for the rest of us they are , well , life and death			2
doctors will argue they are appallingly busy , would love to give people more attention , but do n't have the time			2
or that to do their job properly they need the emotional distance			2
but here 's another story from the same hospital			2
same patient , different consultant , working under exactly the same pressure and constraints as the others			1
and his approach was so full of kindness and compassion that i wonder whether the disparity between those who have a good bedside manner and those who do n't is about individuals rather than the pressure of the job			1
this man became our rock when @entity1 's illness - whatever caused the sepsis in the first place was never identified - sparked off a chain reaction that had doctors chasing problems around his body for a year after he was admitted in march 2006			1
one serious ailment would be contained , only for another to present			2
there was massive internal damage from the sepsis to be repaired surgically , but also an aortic aneurysm ( a swelling of the main blood vessel leading from the heart ) to be bypassed and more infections to be cured			2
not to mention that cancerous kidney tumour to be dealt with when he was well enough			2
' roller - coaster ' does n't come near the ride he was on			2
much of his care fell to this one particular specialist , a urologist , who , to my astonishment , gave me his mobile phone number and told me to call if i had concerns			2
one sunday night , eight months into this medical odyssey , @entity1 was nauseous , with his temperature rising and his remaining strength draining fast			2
so i rang this doctor at home at 9pm			0
he wanted to admit @entity178 immediately for intravenous antibiotics			0
i pleaded for a reprieve			0
it was @entity182 night and i imagined the hospital would be busy dealing with fireworks related accidents			0
she had barely slept for weeks and was extremely anxious , so needed kindness and support plus we had a three - year - old son and he 'd be thrown into turmoil			1
would it be possible , i suggested , for me to give my husband more antibiotics at home and bring him into hospital in the morning ? the doctor agreed , but then warned me : ' @entity1 may deteriorate very quickly			1
and if he does , i want you to call			0
i do n't care if it 's 4am			0
' four in the morning ? for the second time that awful year a doctor 's words reduced me to tears			0
but on this occasion i was overwhelmed by kindness far beyond the call of duty			1
after a further set of operations , including a ten - hour marathon to reconstruct parts of his insides that had been destroyed by infection , this doctor would phone us at home and see how my husband was			1
a five - minute phone call could spare us so much distress			0
and if things were not good , he would tell us to come in and he 'd arrange for a room to see us in			0
and this was not because we had private health to fall back on			0
both doctors were working in the same private healthcare system			0
when i look back at my bedside encounter with that @entity227 of a consultant , if i 'm being rational , i can see that whether i knew the precise name of my husband 's illness or had been forewarned about his tumour was irrelevant			1
it would not make any difference to the prognosis			0
but what she did not have was the nous ( or compassion ) to grasp that a patient 's loved ones are rarely at their most rational			0
i 'd barely slept for weeks and was extremely anxious			0
and , like all relatives , i needed kindness and support because i was going to play a crucial role in my husband 's care			1
doctors prescribe a pill , but it is those of us with a bedside seat who have to sugar it			0
the nearest and dearest have to explain , encourage and display the morale - boosting love and concern that can speed recovery			0
anyone who 's been a hospital patient knows what a comfort it is to have an advocate focusing just on them and making sure they get what they need			0
and the better informed the relative is by the doctors , the sooner they can take the patient home and free up the hospital bed			0
@entity14 wonders some doctors so understanding and others less so relatives are also essential if there is bad news			1
@entity1 still remembers lying in a ward early one morning groggy from an operation when a young man in a bed opposite was visited by the doctors			0
the curtains were pulled round , then ten minutes later swished back			0
once the doctors had gone , the young man - who was no older than 19 - was left on his own			0
he called out : ' they 've just told me the operation did n't work			0
i 'll be dead in six months			0
' my husband was too sick to help or even respond			1
but what has always troubled him is why that young man had been left on his own when a death sentence was passed			0
could n't someone have thought to wait until his parents arrived to tell him the bad news ? why are some doctors so understanding and others less so ? however much you try , you ca n't legislate for compassion			0
human relations are composed of too many subtleties			0
my husband came through his ordeal , though he still bears the scars of six operations within a year , has bits of plastic inside him keeping him alive - stents to bypass the aneurysm , another for a blood clot - and is on a strict , life - long regimen of medication			1
the tumour was treated successfully , and the only lasting side - effect is a pain in his leg - the result of a blood clot after one lengthy operation			0
i know he is fortunate to be alive			0
but they were hard times and i have all too vivid memories of how some doctors were a blessing from on high , but others were the complete opposite , erecting a cordon sanitaire between them and their patient			0
they were too wrapped up , i fear , in their own self - importance			0
over the years we have had to meet many more doctors			0
some are gentle and understanding			0
i ca n't help thinking it 's their decision			0
as with all of us , how we relate to others is our choice			0
i still regret that , on that miserable day , i did n't rush out after the junior doctors and demand to know : what sort of doctor do you want to be remembered as ? a saint ? or a @entity227 ? @entity14 's new novel fragments ( @entity347 , Â£ 19.99 ) .			1

@entity14 says a consultant talked down at she and her sick husband
her ' hostile body language ' was ' telling me to shut up and know my place '
says that like all relatives , what she needed was kindness and support
