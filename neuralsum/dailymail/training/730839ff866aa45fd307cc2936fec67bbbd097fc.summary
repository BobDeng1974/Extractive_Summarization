@entity6 was tested for the deadly virus on her return from @entity9 where she was volunteering with the @entity10 in the fight against @entity3			1
there were fears the 57 - year - old , from @entity15 , was suffering from the illness she was helping to treat after she reported feeling a fever at 1pm @entity19 on thursday			1
ms @entity6 was put under observation and quarantined at @entity21			1
chief health officer dr @entity22 stated on friday morning that initial tests taken have returned a negative result			2
' this is a necessary precaution given the patient has been to @entity35 and has had a fever within the incubation period of 21 days			0
for the sake of her health and to follow due diligence , we want to be sure she is clear of ebola virus disease as well as any other disease			1
' dr @entity38 said regardless of the outcome of the tests , the broader community was not at risk of contracting @entity3			2
ms @entity6 just returned to @entity57 on tuesday after a month volunteering for the @entity10 in the @entity35 nation			1
@entity10 @entity57 confirmed one of their aid workers was under observation for the deadly virus			1
' our heartfelt thoughts are with the @entity10 aid worker and her family			2
we will do everything we can to support her at this difficult time , ' the organisation 's head of international program @entity70 said in a statement to the @entity75			0
mr @entity70 later told @entity76 : ' [ ms @entity6 's ] well , i 've spoken with her recently			1
' we just have to play a bit of a waiting game			0
' she 's in good spirits - she 's feeling good at the moment			1
' ms @entity6 decked out in medical gear during her stint in the @entity35 nation dr @entity22 broke the news at a press conference on thursday afternoon a friend of ms @entity6 's , @entity88 , told @entity90 's @entity89 the volunteer nurse was ' popular ' and ' well - known ' in the @entity15 medical community , and her situation had sparked an outpouring of support from her colleagues at the north @entity2 hospital			1
ms @entity88 said her friend of 25 years was used to working in the tough conditions of @entity35 nations			0
' she wants to help people , she 's incredibly compassionate and she 's selfless like not many people on earth , ' ms @entity88 said			2
' a bunch of the nurses [ at @entity107 ] have gone down to @entity108 [ department ] to offer to nurse @entity6 , which is really brave			1
' they 're upset and they want to help			0
' but ms @entity6 's humanitarian efforts have been slammed by outspoken @entity115 mp @entity114			1
the member for @entity117 - whose electorate takes in the southern area of @entity15 and the town 's airport - said her volunteering pursuits had put the nation at risk			1
mr @entity114 said it was ' unbelievable and incomprehensive ' how a person could get into @entity57 from an @entity3 - infected country			1
' there can not be any compromise with this , ' mr @entity114 said			2
' if you want to go to one of these countries , however laudable your motivation , i am sorry but when you return to @entity57 , you must be quarantined for three weeks - not home quarantined			2
' mr @entity114 said @entity57 aid workers travelling to @entity35 , including ms @entity6 , were putting @entity57 at risk			1
' we love these people , and we honour these @entity57 for being self - sacrificing , but compared to the risk they create for our country , it is not remotely comparable			1
one person 's moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to @entity57 , ' he said			2
but @entity2 's chief medical officer dr @entity22 praised ms @entity6 's efforts and said she had acted appropriately when raising the alarm to health authorities			1
' i think she 's an amazing lady to go to @entity35 and provide that service , ' dr @entity38 said			0
she added : ' she has done everything appropriately			0
' ms @entity6 has been in isolation since she returned home as is the protocol for medical workers who have treated @entity3 patients overseas			1
dr @entity38 said ms @entity6 had been testing herself in the ' isolation ' of her own home and had not been into the @entity15 community since she returned on tuesday			1
' this morning she rang up as part of [ national health ] protocol because she developed a low - grade fever of 37.6 degrees @entity167			2
' but we felt it important that she come into @entity21 for ebola virus disease			2
' ms @entity6 is originally from @entity171 , @entity172 but is living in @entity15 , @entity2 @entity21 where the 57 - year - old is under observation and quarantined dr @entity38 stressed it was almost impossible that ms @entity6 to have infected other people , including her housemate who is showing no symptoms or passengers on her flight , as she did not develop symptoms until thursday morning			1
doctors awaited the results of a blood test and received the results early friday morning as the sample had been sent to @entity187 for testing on thursday afternoon			0
dr @entity38 said the actual blood testing process took about four hours			0
a federal @entity189 spokeswoman told @entity191 any health care worker who comes back from an affected country needs to monitor their health - including taking their temperature twice a day - and can not return to work for 21 days			2
health minister @entity198 has moved to reassure the public that talking to people arriving from ebola - hit countries is still the best method of screening for the deadly disease			0
he said doctors still backed the process to identify and contact people arriving into the country who may have been exposed to the disease			0
' i think that 's the more effective screening process at the moment , but these things evolve , ' he told the @entity90			0
mr @entity198 said introducing a screening in arrivals halls could be problematic			0
' it provides a sort of air of complacency if you like , ' he told the @entity90			0
' so people come through , they feel unwell a couple of days later and they think " no , no , i 've just been through that screening process and i was n't picked up , i 'm ok "			0
' mr @entity198 reiterated the @entity226 had not asked @entity57 for on - the - ground health workers in the stricken @entity35 countries			2
but he said that advice may change over time			0
@entity57 will send help if a case presents in the region , for example in @entity235 , the minister says			0
' we would be expected within our region to rapidly respond , and we have the capacity to do that with a team out of @entity241 ... and resources within @entity243 , ' mr @entity198 said			0
before she left for @entity9 , ms @entity6 spoke to media about her journey , and was actively keeping her friends and family up to date on @entity32			1
' i 'm a little bit nervous , a little bit anxious but healthily anxious i think , ' she told local newspaper @entity250			0
in an interview with the @entity90 last month , she said it was her responsibility to help those in need			0
' i care about humanity and if i have what people need , i would like to use these skills			0
' why me ? well , if not me then who ? ' ms @entity6 said			1
except for the fever , dr @entity38 said ms @entity6 was ' perfectly well ' but because of the circumstances : ' i am treating it as if it was ( @entity3 ) '			1
she said there was no risk to fellow passengers on ms @entity6 's flights home			1
' she did not have any symptoms at all when she was on those flights , so there is no risk at all , ' she said			0
' the ebola virus is very difficult to transmit			2
' it 's not transmitted through the air - you need to be exposed to secretions : vomit , diarrhoea , blood			0
' she does n't have any symptoms producing those secretions			0
' ms @entity6 is expected to find out on friday morning whether or not she has the deadly virus ms @entity6 recently shared happy snaps of her in @entity9 , dressed in quarantine uniforms and being sprayed by decontamination hoses			1
on september 23 , she wrote : ' big day ... have taken our first bloods from our first ebola survivor at the ( @entity10 ) treatment centre			2
it was not the first time ms @entity6 had travelled overseas to help those in need			1
she had previously worked with the @entity10 in war - torn @entity295 and had volunteered in @entity9 in 2002			1
