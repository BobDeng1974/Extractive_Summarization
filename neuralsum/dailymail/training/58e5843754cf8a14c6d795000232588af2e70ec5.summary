he did his best to save what belongings he could , but the fate of his tent was already sealed			0
a herd of four - tonne female elephant seals belly - flopped across the ice and parked themselves squarely on his temporary home , crushing it beyond recognition			1
after some 15 minutes they got bored of the prank and finally rolled off , grunting and yelping , to rejoin their herd			1
the seals launched the surprise attack as the team , from @entity47 - based film company @entity46 , filmed emperor penguins on @entity49 , a remote and rugged @entity51 island between @entity52 and @entity5			1
@entity53 , the film ’s producer , said : ' the crew were camped out for months on @entity49 to get the amazing story of a young @entity57 , and each day they set off to film in different locations around “ @entity60 ” where up to a million penguins live			2
ent - icing : though one of the most remote places on earth , the island is also home to one of @entity70 's most feverish breeding grounds not an ice thing to do : the seals launched the surprise attack as the team , from @entity47 - based film company @entity46 , filmed emperor penguins on @entity49 , a remote and rugged @entity51 island between @entity52 and @entity5 ' while they were busy concentrating on getting the tale of our hero @entity57 in the can , what they did n’t see was that back at the camp a herd of massive slephant seals were busy wallowing all over the tents			1
' they had to double up on the accommodation that night - and it just shows that film making is n’t always glamorous especially with stars like the ones we have in our film			0

@entity102 : earlier , one of the younger seals tried to make off with one of the crew 's walkie talkies but they saved it in the nick of time mister or missus ? males ' harems can contain several dozen females , which are somewhat lighter on their feet being a fifth of the males ¿ size and therefore able to get up to more mischief it 's perhaps a good job these southern elephant seals were only females ; males are the largest living carnivore and can grow up to 16ft and weigh 8,800lb			2
their harems can contain several dozen females , which are somewhat lighter on their feet being a fifth of the males ’ size and therefore able to get up to mischief with the many unattached males which hang around hoping for an illicit affair			0
while the male bull seals are promiscuous , the king penguins with whom they share the island are renowned for their monogamy , as the male shares care of the egg equally with the female			2
the clip is from the making of a feature film @entity146 , which is being released on 6th december 2013 in theatres and on @entity149 in the @entity150 , with @entity151 the @entity57 voiced by @entity152 , best known for being @entity153 in the @entity155 movies			0
