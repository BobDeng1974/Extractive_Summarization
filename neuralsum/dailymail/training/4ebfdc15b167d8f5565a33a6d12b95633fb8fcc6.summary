by @entity0 published : 06:09 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 03:54 est , 18 september 2013 meet @entity1 , who , at 62 , is the @entity2 's oldest glamour model and cites @entity3 as her inspiration			1
@entity1 , who is a slim size 10 and 5ft 7 " , has carved out an unusual niche for herself , combining regular modelling work with the ' odd light glamour one ' and frequent appearances in naturist publications			1
and although happily married to husband @entity14 , 66 , for more than 40 years , the @entity13 model says she still gets plenty of attention from admiring younger men			1
stunning at 60 : @entity1 , 62 , from @entity13 , is still a size 10 and hopes to model for years to come no change : @entity1 seen in a bikini shot taken in her 20s ( left ) and posing in a similar shot taken at the age of 62 ' girls ask me for pictures for their granddads and i get 20 - something men calling me gorgeous , ' she told last week 's closer magazine			1
' they like that i 'm an old lady with a younger body			2
' luckily for husband @entity14 , @entity1 has no plans to trade him in for a younger model			1
' he enjoys having a younger looking lady on his arm , ' she reveals , adding : ' i 'm hoping i 'll still be modelling for years to come			2
' @entity1 , who took to the catwalk for the first time at the age of 10 , modelled throughout her 20s and 30s but gave it up following a debilitating bout of glandular fever in her 40s			1
but after a 20 - year hiatus , she decided to relaunch her career after seeing a photo of actress @entity3 - who is five years older - looking wonderful in a bikini			0
' i missed modelling but did n't consider going back to it until i saw @entity3 on the beach , ' she revealed			0
' i thought , " i 'm 57 and my body is as good as hers "			0
' creative : @entity1 does lots of fantasy themed shoots and also works for naturist publications age - defying : @entity1 shows off her trim figure , honed by regular walks and healthy eating , in these photographs glamorous : @entity1 looks many years younger than she really is and rarely wears make - up but to begin with , things did n't go to plan and @entity1 was turned down by an agency because she did n't have the grandmotherly appearance they were looking for			1
' about six years ago one model agency i approached said that i did n't have the " granny " look for my age , ' @entity1 told @entity67			1
' they missed the whole point - a woman looking young for her age			0
thankfully , i have since been taken on my a another model agency which does realise my potential as a younger - looking model			2
' and it seems that her move has paid off , as @entity1 reveals : ' i am doing a lot of fashion shoots at the moment and the odd light glamour one			1
' ' modelling is my passion , ' she adds			0
' it may look glamorous but actually it is hard work if you want to get to the top of the profession			0
' keeping a level head has helped			0
parts of the modelling industry can be a tad egotistical			0
' @entity1 , who has done almost 1,000 shoots , including some ' fantasy shoots - like dressing up as a warrior in my undies ' says she keeps her face and figure looking good by eating well and eschewing make - up			2
she avoids sunbathing , enjoys regular facials and keeps fit by taking her dog for regular walks along the beach			1
but of all her anti-ageing tricks , the most important one , she says , is to keep smiling			0
' radiate joy and people will smile back , making one 's day a happier experience , ' says @entity1			2
' i honestly think people these days do n't smile enough , i smile at everyone , even animals			0

@entity1 , 62 , is the @entity2 's oldest glamour model and is a slim size 10
she stays youthful by eating healthily and going for regular walks
the @entity123 model says she gets lots of attention from younger men
