a design flaw has left a fighter jet that 's part of the @entity3 's most expensive project ever incapable of carrying the military 's most highly advanced bombs			1
the @entity7 's internal weapons bay is too small for a @entity9 ( @entity9 ) load , according to an @entity11 report			1
the fighter jet is the centerpiece of the @entity16 's new aircraft carrier - based fleet , and dozens have already been ordered			1
trouble in the skies : the @entity7 's internal weapons bay is too small for a @entity9 ( @entity9 ) load ( file photo ) the @entity21 has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned @entity25 aircraft carriers - the @entity26 and the @entity28 @entity27			1
though it 's mandated that an @entity7 jet , designed by @entity31 , hold eight @entity32 in the bay , only four reportedly fit			1
the problem will not affect the @entity16 's consignment of @entity36 , however , as its aircraft are to carry different weapons			1
the f - 35 program will reportedly cost more than £ 2.5billion over the next decade			1
the @entity7 is one of three variants of the f - 35 program - and it 's proved the most expensive and most troublesome to get off the ground			1
the @entity7 features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings - like a helicopter			2
the @entity49 in general - and the @entity7 in particular - has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays			2

the ship will be launched for sea trials in 2016 the @entity21 has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned @entity25 aircraft carriers - the @entity26 ( pictured ) and the @entity28 @entity27 since work began in 2007 , an estimated 10,000 shipyard workers and engineers have been employed in building the ship which will employ a crew of fewer than 700 once complete artists impressions of the ship 's flight deck released before construction was underway			1
when completed the vessel will have enough room for dozens of aircraft @entity73 , a spokesman for the @entity42 , said in an @entity11 interview last week that changes are being made to the jet so it can be released on schedule			0
@entity79 also said that @entity31 will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015			0
' this is not a new issue to us , ' @entity79 told @entity11			0
' we 've been working with the @entity9 program office and their contractors since 2007			0
' the fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support @entity9 that have already been incorporated into production f - 35 aircraft			1
' these minor or remaining changes were put on hold until the aircraft reached a sufficient level of maturity to ensure that the needed changes would not adversely impact any ongoing @entity9 [ ii ] developments			0
' inside @entity11 reported that the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external @entity32 are in fact meant to go on the @entity7			1
an @entity21 spokesman said : ' the @entity9 is not part of the @entity25 's planned weapon inventory for the @entity49 the programme to integrate weapons from the @entity25 inventory onto @entity49 is on track to deliver initial operating capability as planned in december 2018			2
' bombs away : the @entity9 can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared , laser , and radar homing - to hit targets , defense contractor @entity115 says defense contractor @entity115 is behind the @entity9 bomb			2
the company proclaims on its website ' @entity9 can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets , reducing aircrews ' time in harm 's way			0
' the weapon 's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous , larger weapons that required multiple jets			0
' @entity9 's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers , as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions			0
' the @entity9 can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared , laser , and radar homing - to hit targets , the company says			0
the @entity9 weapons system is fully accommodated by both the @entity49 - the @entity146 version - and @entity148 - the @entity150 version , company executive @entity147 told @entity11			2
@entity147 told the news outlet ' i think it 's just the @entity156 when we did our fit checks on the @entity49 , the @entity151 and the @entity152 basically had the same bay			0
' 353 f - @entity160 are being bought by the @entity161 , @entity11 reported			0
according to the news outlet , approximately 17,000 weapons will come from the @entity146 's @entity9 program .			2

@entity7 is *slated* to be used by the @entity16 on @entity26
fighter jet 's internal weapons bay is too small for a proper bomb load
@entity7 is supposed to hold eight @entity9 bombs in the bay , but only four can fit
a program spokesman has said changes are being made to the jet
@entity16 's version is not intended to carry @entity9 bombs
f - 35 program will cost an estimated £ 2.5billion over the next decade
