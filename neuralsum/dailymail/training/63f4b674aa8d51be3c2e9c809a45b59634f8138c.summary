@entity0 , 5 , suffered from @entity1 which caused his skin to blister and peel away a little boy is lucky to be alive after suffering a painful rash that caused 99 per cent of the skin on his body to scald and peel away			1
five year - old @entity0 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , spent three weeks in intensive care after eventually being diagnosed with @entity1 scalded skin syndrome ( @entity1 ) – a condition where bacteria causes the outer layer of skin to shed			1
but doctors misdiagnosed his condition twice , at first prescribing antibiotics as they thought it was tonsillitis			1
then , as the rash got worse , they misdiagnosed him with another rare condition			2
believing he had @entity22 - a severe allergic reaction to antibiotics - they took him off the drugs in the hope the rash would go down			1
but after 18 hours off medication , the rash was getting worse			1
a new doctor instantly recognised the condition as @entity1 and screamed that @entity0 should be put back on antibiotics instantly			1
but it was too late by then , and @entity0 's mother , @entity33 , 38 , had to watch helplessly while her little boy spent three weeks in intensive care at the burns unit at @entity37 in @entity38 and lost 99 per cent of his skin			1
now recovering at home , he has been left with scarring , has difficulty sleeping and has to walk on his tiptoes as the skin on the back of his legs is so tight			1
ms @entity33 , a cleaner , said she felt powerless being unable to comfort her son while he was in pain			0
she said : ' he was covered head to toe in bandages , like a mummy			0
' you feel totally helpless , it 's a feeling you only know if your child has been sick			0
i 'm not religious but i prayed for @entity0			2
' i could n't even give him a cuddle because he 'd be left in agony			0
' @entity0 's symptoms first appeared as a red rash around his mouth , and then some spots across his body			1
at first ms @entity33 did n't think it was anything to worry about			0
@entity0 's mother @entity33 , 38 , had to watch helplessly while her son spent three weeks in intensive care			2
' i could n't even give him a cuddle because he 'd be left in agony ' she said @entity0 's rash , initially around his mouth and with a few spots on his chest , got worse and his entire body began to blister			1
eventually he lost 99 per cent of his skin ( his face is pictured left and his leg pictured right ) initially doctors said @entity0 had tonsillitis ( right ) but after the rash got worse he was eventually sent to intensive care			1
he has been left with scarring and has to sometimes walk on tiptoes as his skin is so tight she said : ' i called the @entity85 line , but he seemed fine in himself still - he even went out for a bounce on the trampoline			1
' that was at nine in the morning , but by three in the afternoon he was lying on the sofa poorly			0
' i tried to take him to bed and he screamed in pain			0
she took @entity0 to @entity93 in @entity94 , where he was misdiagnosed with tonsillitis and sent away with antibiotics			1
@entity98 scalded skin syndrome is a widespread painful rash caused by bacteria			1
this germ produces a toxin that causes the outer layer of the skin to be shed			1
the toxin is removed by the immune system and the kidneys			0
if either is not working properly the toxin can circulate in the blood and can then affect most of the body ’s surface			0
in young children , especially newborns , the immune system and kidneys are not fully developed , and this explains why they are most commonly affected			0
the original infection may be relatively minor , for example an infected graze or a red sticky eye			0
after a few days a widespread patchy red rash appears and rapidly joins up to cover most of the skin surface			2
unlike most rashes it is painful and affected children are miserable and feverish and may not want to be held or touched			0
soon there is loosening of skin , which can detach from the underlying layers , sometimes with easily - torn , fluid - filled blisters			0
if large areas of skin are shed , body fluid and salts can be lost causing dehydration , and further infection may get through into the bloodstream			0
the infection is treated with oral antibiotics , which in severe cases may be given through a vein			0
the skin needs gentle cleansing and soothing creams or dressings , which may include antibiotics or antiseptics			0
special medical care is needed if fluid or salt balance is affected , or if there is a blood infection			0
source : @entity152 of @entity153 hours later his rash had spread and was starting to blister so ms @entity33 rushed him back to the hospital			2
there , @entity0 was once again misdiagnosed , this time with @entity22 , an allergic reaction to antibiotics or epilepsy medicine which can cause a rash			1
doctors took him off antibiotics , but in the morning , a new doctor - who instantly recognised it was n't @entity22 but staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome - and shouted that he needed to be put back on medication immediately , ms @entity33 claims			1
in most cases , @entity1 can be completely cured if antibiotics are given in the early stages , but if large areas of skin are shed , body fluid and salts can be lost causing dehydration , and further infection may get through into the bloodstream			2
after being off antibiotics overnight , @entity0 now had to be sent to a specialist burns unit for treatment			1
ms @entity33 said : ' @entity0 was off medication for about 18 hours			1
' when the ward doctor came round the next morning he knew straight away what it was and screamed to get @entity0 back on antibiotics			2
' by then it was too late and they had to decide whether he should go to @entity187 or a specialist burns unit			1
' @entity0 was transferred to the burns unit at @entity37 in @entity38			1
he spent three weeks in intensive care and a week on the general ward before being allowed home			0
ms @entity33 said her son is still suffering and they expect he will have scars for life			0
she said : ' @entity0 is still really itchy at night and it stops him sleeping and makes him tired for school			0
it 's a nuisance for him			0
' he was first diagnosed with @entity1 at the end of june and he 's still suffering now			2
' the bacteria got past the epidermal layer on his legs so he 's still recovering and we expect there will be some scarring			2
' he has to walk on his tip toes sometimes because the skin on the back of his legs is so tight			2
it 's like he has really bad sunburn			0
