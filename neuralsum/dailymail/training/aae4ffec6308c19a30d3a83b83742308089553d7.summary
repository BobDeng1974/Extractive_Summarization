hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box			1
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity10 vs @entity12 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			1
and that means fewer goals in the @entity16			1
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			2
it 's time to end that			0
so join us in our campaign to say @entity24 to players and referees			2
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			1
@entity31 has launched a campaign to stop exponents of the penalty box dark arts getting away with blatant cheating			1
hands off in @entity38 aims to put an end to the increasing amount of wrestling , grappling and shirt pulling that goes on throughout the @entity16			1
those who commit these offences are quite simply denying the football - watching public more goals			0
and although this has been going on for years in the @entity16 , the sight of @entity10 's @entity49 and @entity50 manhandling @entity12 's @entity52 and @entity53 on sunday was a new low			1
it was more reminiscent of a wrestling match than a top - flight football game as the @entity12 duo were grappled to the ground with a combination of headlocks and pull downs			2
more astonishing was the fact that referee @entity65 did nothing to stop them , waving away claims to what seemed to everyone else to be an obvious penalty			1
now , the key point here is that @entity10 are no worse than any other team for committing these offences , it 's just that sunday 's grappling was so high profile			2
@entity31 has decided that enough is enough			1
you can back our campaign by printing out our downloadable @entity83 logo and proudly displaying it at matches			1
you can also back our appeal on @entity88 by tweeting your support along with the hashtag # @entity91			1
by tweeting this hashtag you will automatically be entered into our competition to win an @entity95 shirt signed by @entity31 columnists @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
@entity53 wrestles with @entity49 ( left ) while on the right , @entity52 grapples @entity50 @entity101 's @entity100 ( right ) did concede a penalty for this grapple with @entity105 's @entity104 last week @entity107 's @entity106 ( centre ) has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking and holding the @entity113 campaign logo that you can download ( link above ) and take to games @entity52 , @entity12 captain ‘ me and @entity53 were double headlocked at every corner			1
’ @entity117 , @entity107 assistant manager ‘ grappling			2
that is the new word is it ? it is the referees ’ interpretation and we ’ll leave it to them			0
that ’s what the referees and the officials are paid for			0
so whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it ’s in their hands really			2
did i do it as player ? no , i was a winger and did n’t have to mark anyone			0
’ ian wright @entity140 striker ‘ there should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set - pieces			2
it was like @entity147 in the @entity10 area			0
’ @entity149 , former top referee ‘ hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned			0
once fans , managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			0
’ @entity98 , @entity140 defender ‘ defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place			1
’ @entity164 , @entity165 manager ‘ in a congested area how can you judge if someone ’s been blocked ? it ’s part of the game and some people are good at it			0
a local @entity185 referee came in and he was asking me about it			0
“ can you show me some blocking techniques ? ” that was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it			0
the confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free - kicks , but the same wo n’t be given as penalties			0
there has to be consistency			0
’ and the readers of @entity191 ... ‘ it ’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves			0
it ’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players			0
’ @entity199 , @entity200 ‘ to those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop			0
i ’ve been watching football since the @entity210 and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst i ’ve ever seen			2
’ sir @entity213 , @entity215 win an @entity95 shirt signed by @entity97 ( left ) , @entity96 ( right ) and @entity98 ( below ) @entity98 ( centre ) in action for @entity95 against @entity219 in 1998			1
