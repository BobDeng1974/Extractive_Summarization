by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:26 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 10:00 est , 17 october 2012 on may 15th 2012 , @entity2 asked people around the world to pick up their cameras and take a photograph			1
what returned was an extraordinary collection of images - from the simple image of a mother feeding her baby in @entity13 , to the lonely image of an @entity16 fishing in @entity17			1
the images will be published online and in a book ( well , 1,000 of them ) - and also locked in a copper mine in @entity21 , giving future historians a glimpse of just one day on our planet			1
my 12 - year - old son , @entity39 , is quizzing my eight - year - old daughter , @entity40 , on this week 's spelling list			1
in between words , he debugs the video game he 's writing on his @entity45 ' photo : @entity46 09:54 : this is my partner @entity47 with the dogs near the @entity50 base on @entity51			1
they are gentle but untamed and spend the entire year outdoors			1
we plan our route by first dropping supplies by plane or boat			1
photo : @entity60 16:45pm : 42 @entity61 , @entity62 : the youngest members of the @entity64 rehearsing @entity62 folk songs for a forthcoming concert			1
they are playing single - row accordions with two bells , called @entity69 after the city			1
at the piano is the ensemble director , @entity72			1
the boys are aged between five and seven and have been playing for a year			1
photo : @entity76 15:19 : @entity77 has worked for 15 years at the @entity78 in @entity79 , selling okporoko ( stockfish ) caught in the creeks and rivers that flow down through southern @entity79 to the @entity83			1
the dried fish ' red snapper and more ' are a popular feature of @entity79 cuisine , prepared by soaking and softening in stew			1
photo : @entity90 from the 100,000 photographs taken and submitted , from 165 countries , 1,000 of the best have been selected to appear in an astonishing new book - a day in the @entity94 - published this week , documenting quite how extraordinary one seemingly regular day can be			1
organisers say the @entity98 project is the ' largest collaborative structured photographic event ' ever undertaken , supported by many of the world ’s leading public figures , including archbishop @entity103 , deputy secretary general of the @entity106 @entity105 , former president of finland @entity107 and entrepreneur @entity109			1
the photographs convey sharp juxtapositions between different geographical regions and economic positions – one image pictures a @entity116 man , comfortably tucked up in bed with his tablet computer and smartphone , whilst another shows homeless men asleep on the pavements of @entity123 , a sad consequence of rapid population growth			1
similarly , many people chose to take pictures of the food they consumed on may 15th , showing the diverse range in diet around the world , from health food to fast food and surplus to scarcity			1
it is also possible to compare different styles of architecture globally – affected by wealth , population size and culture – from the sky - scraping @entity142 in central @entity144 , to colourful , old wooden houses in @entity146 in @entity62 , to the shanty settlements of @entity148			1
' some of my friends are travellers and occasionally i look after their horses			1
' this pony is @entity154 , who was lent to us four months ago			1
' i have tried not to fall in love with her since the owner might sell her some day , but she ’s captured my heart			1
' photo : @entity161 ' my breakfast and the pug that coveted it			1
the dog ’s name is @entity167 , and ' she belongs to my boyfriend ’s cousin , @entity168			2
@entity167 was right there , wanting my breakfast			2
' i do n’t think that @entity172 and a bagel with strawberry cream cheese particularly whet a dog ’s appetite			2
' photo : @entity178 12:58 : when the @entity181 ran aground on 13 january 2012 , the tiny island of @entity180 suddenly found itself at the centre of a crisis			2
the islanders rose to the challenge , helping to rescue people at sea , then taking drenched and terrified survivors into their homes			2
perhaps their kindness counterbalanced the infamy of the ship 's captain , @entity191 , who faces trial on charges of multiple manslaughter , causing a shipwreck , and abandoning ship			2
of the 4,252 passengers on the cruise ship , 32 died			2
somewhat uncomfortably , @entity180 now finds itself a focus for disaster tourism			2
photo : @entity205 16:14 : 38 @entity206 , @entity21 : ' me and my boyfriend @entity208 went out for a walk and laid down on a football field			1
he told me i should upload a picture of when we kissed each other , and so i did			2
' the two , who are 18 and study sciences together at school , were best friends for two years before they started dating a month ago			2
@entity208 lives in @entity218 , a @entity206 suburb			2
photo : @entity220 19:37 : @entity221 , @entity222 : ' the place was filled with tourists enjoying the evening and alongside the joyful crowd i found these two sorrowful faces in the sea of celebration			2
she is @entity231 , 43 years old and from southern @entity232			2
@entity233 is not a regular on the street			0
@entity231 moved to @entity221 three years ago , right after her parents died			0
she thinks she might have a brother in @entity221			0
when i met @entity231 again , she did not know where @entity233 had gone			0
@entity231 is one of those people who live in the street , sunrise to sunset			0
when their bodies are almost giving up from the day 's challenges , a shaded corner will be a resting place			0
i will be back in that same place where i found them			0
' photo : @entity251 alongside each photograph featured in a day in @entity253 are relevant details , including the name of the photographer , a description of what the picture is showing and its geographical location			0
the photography shows a great variety of situations and subject matter , as well as technical specifics - from small pictures snapped on mobile phones , to larger , more professional compositions - all with their own sincere poignancy and resonance			0
celebrity participants in the project , run by a @entity21 charity , include @entity274 boss @entity109 , former @entity276 president @entity275 and @entity278 archbishop @entity103 , who said the photos would help people connect with one another and ' transcend the barriers of language , age , gender and culture '			1
22:28 : @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity116 : ' this is in the basement bedroom of my parents ' house , where my boyfriend has been living for the past year			0
i sleep in my own bedroom two floors above , since we are @entity297 are in our mid- 20s and have been a couple since we were 17 , living with parents to save money for our first home			0
my parents are devout @entity303 , but neither my boyfriend nor i are			0
under their roof , i usually respect their rules ¿ however , most nights we still get to spend time in private before i go upstairs to sleep			1
here , he has just gotten out of the shower			0
he is a basketball player and has been working out since he was a teenager			0
contrary to his fit physique , another one of his night - time routines is to eat half a bag of chips or a huge bowl of ice cream			1
when i had the camera out , he was a bit shy			0
in general he hates getting his picture taken but he is proud to show off his muscles			0
i think this photo captures our living situation right now : elusive , almost sec 09:38 : 6			0
@entity326 , @entity13 , @entity222 : ' i look like i just rolled out of bed			0
but mornings consist of getting the babe 's oatmeal out of the fridge and the pureed prunes from the freezer to defrost a bit			0
@entity335 likes his oatmeal cold			0
at least he does n't seem to mind it			0
i think that with teething ( he just popped two teeth ) it feels good on his gums			0
he 's such a good eater			0
15:30 : an @entity346 fisherman is navigating through the icy waters of @entity348 , @entity17 12:13pm : @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 : a passion for cricket is something that unites @entity351 , whether rich or poor			0
a lack of proper facilities and equipment has never stopped children from practising the sports they love			0
these enthusiastic players are the children of dairy farmers , imitating their sporting heroes , such as fellow @entity363 and legendary cricketer , @entity366 photo : @entity367			0

images will be published on the @entity370 , compiled into a book and buried down a @entity21 *cooper* mine as a time *capsule* for future generations
