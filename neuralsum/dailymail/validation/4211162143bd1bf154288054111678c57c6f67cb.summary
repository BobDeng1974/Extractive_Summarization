the rumbling discontent among @entity2 fans towards manager @entity3 is gathering momentum after wednesday night 's dismal 2 - 0 defeat at @entity6 left last season 's @entity8 challengers just six points above the relegation zone			1
after one win in 12 games and only one clean sheet away from @entity16 since september , it is becoming common to hear fans complain that the @entity18 is ' turning us into @entity20 '			0
the statistics actually bear out their worst fears			0
in @entity3 's last season at @entity20 , he had 30 points from 30 games – and went down			2
@entity2 currently have 28 points from 28 matches			2
@entity2 manager @entity3 and his team look lost in the @entity31 of late @entity2 's underperforming stars now just sit six points above the relegation zone in the @entity31 @entity34 ( left ) scored in @entity6 's 2 - 0 win over @entity2 at the @entity36 on wednesday night the @entity37 , the source of so much pride earlier in the season , is now looking like an unwanted distraction			1
@entity2 face @entity42 at @entity16 on thursday before their now - crucial next league match against @entity44 on sunday			2
the following week they have to contend with a 3,000 - mile round trip to @entity46 for the second leg			0
the players may not get into their beds until 4am on the friday morning , just 60 hours before they take to the pitch at @entity52 for what , inconceivably , could be billed a relegation six - pointer against @entity55			0
so what has gone wrong at @entity2 – a club who finished fifth last season and were tipped to be fighting it out with @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 at the top			0
here are eight reasons why @entity2 are fighting to stay in the top flight , where they 've been since 1954			0
the £ 28million non-talisman in retrospect , @entity69 was foolish to declare he wanted to become the world 's best player when he hit a purple patch on loan last season			1
@entity2 smashed their transfer record to make a £ 28million move from @entity60 permanent in the summer , a deal that now makes @entity78 look a genius			0
@entity69 has scored just seven @entity31 goals , fewer than @entity82 's @entity81 who cost less than a quarter that amount			1
@entity69 's notorious first touch looks as if it is getting worse , not better , and he has complained @entity2 's style is not direct enough to get the best out of him			1
@entity69 declared he wanted to be the world 's best player last season but he has been far from it @entity3 must be desperate to find a way to help re-find his £ 28million centre forward 's best form @entity69 's first touch has always had a bad reputation but it has proved even more of a problem this season @entity96 @entity3 believes in filling his players with confidence and it makes him look a great man - manager when things are going well			1
but salty old professionals like @entity105 , with whom he has fallen out , @entity102 and @entity103 have been around long enough to realise that a good old - fashioned rollocking is needed at times			0
@entity107 was n't always popular with the @entity2 players but @entity3 could do with handing out a few home truths like the @entity110 did			2
@entity102 ( left ) and @entity103 ( right ) have been at @entity2 for years and understand the way things work @entity3 has fallen out with @entity105 but the defender knows that on occasion players need a rollocking the disappearing @entity117 valued at £ 60million not so long ago and feted by @entity3 as potentially the best @entity120 player of all time , 21 - year - old @entity117 has started just over half of the club 's @entity31 games this season , 15 of 28			1
at @entity6 when @entity3 had one last substitution to use to try and salvage a result , he turned to @entity127 , rather than the supposed heir to @entity129			2
@entity117 has played in so many different positions this season – holding midfield , out wide , @entity133 – he looks confused			0
@entity117 was left on the bench on wednesday night , even when @entity2 were searching for a goal @entity117 was lauded by @entity3 as potentially the best @entity120 player of all - time but he has n't progressed injuries one of the reasons @entity2 are ultimately likely to get out of trouble is that important members of the old guard are heading back			1
@entity142 tasted his first @entity31 action since early december on wednesday night after a serious foot injury and his knowhow will be vital			1
even more importantly , @entity146 – the best left back in the @entity31 – is pencilled in to face @entity44 having missed six games with a knee injury			0
@entity149 and @entity150 are also out while @entity152 's midweek appearance was his first @entity31 start for nearly two years			0
@entity146 - the best left back in the @entity31 - will be a huge boost on return from injury @entity142 is also returning to the first - team fold and could be a key man in @entity2 's run - in @entity160 traditionally , @entity3 has one of the best records in the loan market			1
@entity163 enjoyed the best spell of his career at @entity20 and last season @entity166 and @entity69 were big hits at @entity16			2
but the @entity169 seems to have deserted him			0
@entity170 has hardly had a kick since he joined from @entity60 and @entity172 was woeful and substituted after an hour at @entity6			0
@entity163 ( left ) was well managed by @entity3 during his loan spell at @entity20 which saw him hit top form by contrast , @entity170 has hardly had a kick since signing a season - long loan deal from @entity60 @entity172 came in on loan from @entity179 but he was woeful at the @entity36 on wednesday it 's all attack , and no defence @entity3 earned a reputation for concentrating too much on his attacking play at @entity20 and history is in danger of repeating itself at @entity2			1
despite inheriting a strong back - five from @entity107 , @entity2 have looked less and less certain at the back , and the collywobbles have effected goalkeeper @entity190 , who has gone from @entity192 superstar to dodgy keeper this season			2
the repetitive defensive drills under @entity107 were boring but they did serve a purpose			0
@entity190 was brilliant at the @entity192 but he has had troubles in the @entity2 goal this season @entity107 employed repetitive defensive drills at @entity2 - but they did the trick for his side @entity202 getting the balance right between @entity204 and the @entity31 has foxed a lot of managers over the years			1
@entity3 seemed to be on a winner earlier in the season with his fondness for team rotation helping the club qualify for the knock - out stages in @entity204 while holding head above water in the league			0
but the regular changes have affected rhythm in recent weeks and the league form has dropped alarmingly			0
@entity2 were flying high when they won away in @entity219 but the rotation for @entity204 has had an effect @entity222 @entity166 has been one of the @entity31 's most consistent midfield players over the last 15 years but at the age of 34 , he is becoming to look a liability			1
@entity2 decided to sign him on a permanent basis last summer but his most notable contribution this season is to have broken the all - time @entity31 record for yellow cards			1
his caution at @entity6 on wednesday – number 106 – has earned him a two - match ban and that might prove a blessing in disguise			2
@entity166 has been a consistent performer for 15 years but now looks like a liability in midfield @entity166 's caution on wednesday night was his 106th in the @entity31 - an all - time record for any player			1

@entity2 are just six points above relegation in the @entity31
they lost 2 - 0 to @entity6 at the @entity36 on wednesday night
@entity3 has incurred the wrath of the fans for their decline
@entity69 has looked nothing like the on - loan player of last year
@entity117 is barely in the @entity2 side and has been overlooked
members of @entity2 's old guard have had injury problems
@entity166 is looking like a liability in the heart of the midfield
