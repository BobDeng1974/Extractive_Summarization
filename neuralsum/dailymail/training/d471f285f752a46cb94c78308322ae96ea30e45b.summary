@entity0 admitted throwing her six - day - old baby girl down a bin chute but had denied her intention had been to kill her a mother tried to kill her newborn daughter by dropping her more than 40ft down a tower block rubbish chute , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity0 is alleged to have ‘ completely swaddled ’ the baby , put her in the chute , then tidied up her fifth - floor flat			1
the girl was found – apparently lifeless – by her father later that day			0
she had suffered severe head and brain injuries , including several skull fractures			1
during her fall , she had struck a metal deflector plate placed at the foot of the chute to slow items of rubbish			2
pieces of a broken moses basket were found in a bin at the bottom of the chute and bits of wood were discovered inside the flat , @entity22 @entity21 heard			1
@entity31 initially told police that the six - day - old girl had been kidnapped by strangers , the jury heard			0
the 25 - year - old , from @entity36 , denies attempted murder , causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm			1
but prosecutor @entity41 said it was expected that @entity31 would accept during the hearing that she put the baby , who can not be named for legal reasons , into the chute			1
the jury would hear evidence from two psychiatrists who had assessed her in recent weeks , he said			2
‘ the prosecution contend that @entity31 knew what she was doing when she carried the baby from the flat and dropped her those five floors down the chute , ’ mr @entity52 said			2
the defendant ’s ‘ reason or capacity ’ to understand the consequences of her actions had not been removed by any mental illness at the time of the incident , he added			2
@entity22 @entity21 heard that when the baby hit a metal plate at the bottom of the chute it was travelling at around 32mph			1
miraculously it survived but suffered severe brain injuries including several skull fractures the court was shown computer - generated images as mr @entity52 outlined how a crash test dummy had been used to reconstruct the baby ’s fall , which took 2.2 seconds			1
prosecutors said they believe @entity31 knew what she was doing and intended to kill the baby he told the jury : ‘ as the police investigation developed , an expert in accident reconstruction was instructed to examine how she fell and what type of forces would have been involved			0
’ experiments with a dummy of a nine - month - old child revealed the vertical drop of 44ft produced an estimated impact speed with the metal plate of 32mph			0
‘ in summary , the expert who carried out these tests was able to conclude that the force with which the baby would have struck the metal deflector was comparable to having been in a 30mph car crash without wearing a seat - belt , ’ mr @entity52 said			0
‘ the reason why she decided to place her daughter in the rubbish chute may never be known or understood			0
‘ however , the prosecution say that her intention can be clearly identified from her actions on that september afternoon last year			0
there is unlikely to be any dispute that @entity31 did cause undoubtedly serious injuries			0
‘ the focus , the prosecution anticipates , will be on the defendant ’s state of mind in those crucial minutes			0
‘ the prosecution anticipates that the key issue for you in this case will be what did @entity0 intend , if anything , when she put her into the rubbish chute			1
the prosecution submits in this case that her intention was to kill			0
