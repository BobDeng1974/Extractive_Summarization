by @entity0 published : 15:07 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 11:04 est , 19 october 2012 as a proud hunter who enjoys the outdoor lifestyle , @entity2 's appeal to the base of the @entity4 is thought to have been one of the main reasons why @entity9 chose the self - styled action man for his presidential ticket			1
so when the @entity13 congressman was photographed in @entity14 yesterday buying his 10 - year - old daughter camouflage gear for a hunting expedition this fall to go along with the rifle he got her last @entity18 , the outrage from liberal 's condemning the father - daughter trip was all too predictable			1
but the backlash against father - of - three @entity2 has been met with a remarkable counter-backlash from gun enthusiasts across the country who have taken to @entity28 to post pictures of their little girls posing with rifles , automatic weapons and hand guns supporting the @entity4 politicians right to introduce his daughter to firearms			1
@entity40 's daughter with a @entity42 rifle @entity43 took to @entity28 after @entity44 tweeted in support of @entity2 shopping for hunting gear for his daughter the small army of support began when @entity51 contributor @entity44 spoke up in favour of @entity2 and tweeted that she had taken her 12 - year daughter shooting for her birthday and that ' self - defence is one of the best gifts you can give a girl			1
' this invited hundreds of dads , mothers and supporters of the @entity42 to come forward to share their memories and pictures of learning to shoot from their father or of teaching their girl to fire a gun			2
one proud parent with the @entity28 name @ @entity72 uploaded a picture of his 13 - year - old daughter with her @entity76 shotgun and the 20 - pound turkey that she had just killed and that she was going to eat before heading off to the mall to buy some shoes			1
@entity44 's tweet that started the whole backlash against the backlash is replied to by @entity84 who also tweeted his daughter at the shooting range on her 16th birthday @entity84 's daughter spent her 16th birthday at the firing range and tweeted this picture in support of @entity2 @entity92 's 12 - year - old daughter still needs to work on her grip according to the tweet he posted supporting @entity2 some of the tweets from individuals were in defence of their constitutional rights , with @entity102 putting pictures on the social networking site of his two girls with semi-automatic weapons stating , ' it 's not only my right , but my duty to share and teach the love of shooting with my daughters			1
' one father , @entity112 , decided to put a sweet picture of his little girl holding a rifle almost as tall as her onto @entity28 , stating that ' this is my daughter age 10 learning gun safety			1
' in addition to dads standing up for @entity2 , daughters got in on the act too			2
@entity123 tweeted , ' my @entity124 bought me my first shotgun , a @entity126 1100 with a full choke barrell when i was twelve			0
got first buck with it			0
' standing with a gun almost as tall as her , @entity112 's daughter is ten - year - old - the same age as @entity133 @entity102 claimed it was his duty to support his daughters learning how to shoot - just like like @entity2 an avid hunter and outdoorsman , @entity2 somewhat expectedly found himself under attack when he took a break from a bus tour through @entity141 to shop at @entity142 for 15 minutes to buy his 10 - year - old ddaughter @entity143 camouflage gear			1
he told the reporters who followed him that he is going to take her deer hunting this fall in @entity13 and @entity148 , which is where his wife 's family lives			2
' she 's going to get to go hunting this year for the first time , ' said @entity2 , who has previously told the press that he bought his daughter a @entity156 700			1
243 junior model rifle last @entity18			0
' she 's 10 - years - old , so she can hunt starting at 10			1
' she 's been getting ready , she 's been practicing			0
' i just need to get her some clothes			0
' the controversy started after @entity2 was seen to buy his ten - year - old daughter hunting gear while he took a break from campaigning in @entity141 buying his girl gloves and a jacket for $ 101.14 , @entity2 has spoken at length in the past about his love of @entity170 outdoor pursuits			1
he has pointedly said ' hey , i 'm a @entity171 deer hunter			0
i am happy to be clinging to my guns and my religion ' , which is a dig at president @entity176 who made a campaign speech in @entity179 in 2008 in which he said some voters , ' cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who are n't like them			0
' but in comparison to his boss , @entity2 is a big - game hunter comparable to @entity190			2
' i 'm not a big - game hunter			0
i 've made that very clear			0
i 've always been a rodent and rabbit hunter			0
small varmints , if you will , ' said @entity9 in 2008 , during his first unsuccessful tilt at the @entity170 presidency			0
@entity4 vice presidential @entity2 waves as he walks with his ( @entity200 ) son @entity199 , daughter @entity143 , wife @entity202 , son @entity199 and mother @entity204 after accepting the nomination during the third session of the @entity207 @entity2 has described himself as a @entity171 deer hunter who is happy to cling to his guns and religion the support for @entity2 , 42 , followed the initial backlash his shopping trip for his daughter first provoked			1
one @entity28 user , @entity215 took to the site to post the message that ' aww ! there 's nothing sweeter than a @entity124 and a daughter bonding over the body of a dead animal they probably wo n't eat			2
' another user called @ nschim posted : ' @entity2 gets daughter a rifle ? ? ? maybe its for her shotgun wedding if she is not allowed to use birth control			1
' according to an interview with @entity232 magazine , @entity2 ' shoots a @entity234 compound and loves the thrill of bow - hunting , but also enjoys firearms			2
' ' my daughter she 's been hunting with me for years , watching me , but she 's old enough this year to hunt on her own			2
' she 's really looking forward to it			0
' an earlier version of this article carried a caption that suggested the girl in the first image was holding a military grade assault rifle			0
we are happy to clarify that this is not the case .			0
