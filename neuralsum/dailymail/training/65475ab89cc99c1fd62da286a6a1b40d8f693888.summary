a drama about comedian @entity2 's life , set to air tomorrow , has appalled his daughter @entity3 who has branded the film ' all lies '			1
the film titled not like that , like this , will be shown on @entity9 tomorrow from 9pm and will feature actors including @entity11 , of shameless fame , @entity15 actress @entity14 and @entity16 star @entity13			2
but the day before the film , which will expose @entity2 as an abuser and a drunk , is set to be watched by millions across the country , ms @entity3 has said that her father would be ' disgusted '			1
@entity3 was 17 at the time of the picture			2
she said that her father would be ' disgusted ' by the @entity9 drama which is set to air tomorrow the timing of the film will tie in with the 30th anniversary of the comedian 's death but , far from a tribute to one of the @entity41 's favourite performers , it will claim that mr @entity2 was a drunk and a domestic abuser			1
@entity2 died of a heart attack live on stage in front of millions of viewers , during a performance on the @entity50 variety show at @entity51 in 1984 , aged just 63			2
the two - hour production focuses almost entirely on his affair with his assistant @entity54 known as @entity54			2
his daughter has criticised @entity9 for not allowing her to have a full input in the production process			2
she told the @entity58 that she wanted to meet the producers but that she was barred from discussions about the script			0
the claims come after its writer @entity63 said that ms @entity3 had approved of the script			1
he said : ‘ we were anxious , but she was very nice about it			0
’ ms @entity3 argues that her father would not have been such a well - respected and adored figure if the film 's content was true			1
a trailer of the @entity9 drama , see below , shows @entity2 drinking heavily and hitting his wife after she confronts him about an affair			1
another scene shows ms fieldhouse with a bruised cheek , but the comedian 's daughter said that she never saw her father ' lay a finger on anyone ' - although she admitted that her father had a ' terrible temper '			1

she said the house was a place of cherished memories			0
the film suggests that @entity2 's wife @entity104 knew about the affair with ms fieldhouse			1
his daughter said that the depiction is inaccurate because her mother only found out about the affair once ms @entity54 's book @entity111 was published in 1986			1
in the film , @entity104 also smokes , which ms @entity3 has said is another error because her mother stopped smoking when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was left with one lung			1

writer , @entity63 has defended the drama , refuting claims that it is a disrespectful portrayal of the late @entity2			2
he said it was fair to include the domestic violence scenes because they were ' on record ' but he added that ' i hope that we did it in a delicate way			0
' he added : ' you do n’t want people who do n’t know @entity146 ’s comedy to go away thinking he was a wife - beater			0
' but he was physical , and he was physical with his wife , who gave as good as she got			0
' the flaws in @entity2 's character were first revealed in 2011 when extracts from the diaries of @entity2 ’s agent @entity152 were published			1

in 1973 , @entity152 wrote : ‘ she is divorcing him			0
