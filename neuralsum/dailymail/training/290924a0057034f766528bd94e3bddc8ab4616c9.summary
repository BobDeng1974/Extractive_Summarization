a mother - of - two has been jailed for making two false rape claims against men she was dating after one , who she had met online , failed to show up for a liaison			2
@entity5 , 23 , from @entity6 , was jailed for eight months after telling police she had been raped in a @entity9 car in a supermarket car park			1
the victim of her slur @entity13 spent 14 hours in a police cell and suffered the indignity of an intimate medical examination while the police spent 90 hours investigating before finally concluding it was a hoax			1
jailed : @entity5 made a false claim of rape against @entity13 , a man she had met online , after he failed to show up for a liaison @entity6 @entity22 heard @entity23 , 23 , was given a community penalty in 2007 after a similar false allegation against a former boyfriend			1
jailing her judge @entity27 said : ' rape is such a terrible , diabolical offence that it is always treated very seriously in these courts			2
it is a dreadful thing for a person to be raped			1
it is a most serious allegation for one person to make against another			2
it is truly awful if it is untrue			0
' @entity23 , of @entity39 , @entity6 admitted perverting the course of justice by making a false rape allegation			0
@entity43 , prosecuting , said a man rang the police saying @entity23 had been raped in the car at a @entity6 supermarket ten minutes beforehand by a man called @entity13			1
an incident team swung into action and police traced the car driver within 20 minutes			1
officers went to his address but found the car engine cold in the driveway and a dry patch where the car was standing although it had been raining heavily			1
despite their suspicions about the allegation police arrested mr @entity13 and as well as being kept in a cell for 14 hours and being examined by a doctor his car was thoroughly searched			1
@entity23 was taken to the police station and also examined by a doctor but refused to take part in a video interview			1
ms @entity43 said it took a month for six police officers and a detective inspector to finally ascertain that the allegation was groundless			1
mr @entity13 told police he met @entity23 on a dating site and for him it was a purely sexual relationship but she wanted something more and they would often exchange texts and arrange to meet up			1
second offence : @entity6 @entity22 heard @entity23 , 23 , was given a community penalty in 2007 after a similar false allegation against a former boyfriend on july 16 , 2010 they exchanged texts about 9pm			1
he walked his dog an hour later and swapped more texts with her			0
she wanted to meet him and he said he would but had no intention of doing so			0
he went to bed and the next thing he knew was when officers arrived at his home			0
he said in a victim impact statement read in court that he was ' terrified ' of the medical examination but went through with it because he was innocent			1
when he asked for a glass of water in his prison cell an officer gave him a look as of he was ' scum ' which he said would haunt him for the rest of his life			0
he had been forced to take time off work as a school caretaker with stress and it was as if ' his entire life had fallen apart			0
' @entity23 was then arrested			2
she admitted she had an affair with mr @entity13 but on the night in question she was pressurised by other people she was with to report him to the police			2
in the previous allegation which was made in 2006 her ex-boyfriend was arrested and interviewed by police but @entity23 then undertook a video interview before police concluded she was lying			1
@entity122 , for @entity23 , said she lived in supported council rented accommodation and had suffered with learning difficulties			0
' the offence was unsophisticated and it was obvious to the police from the outset that there were suspicions about the allegation , ' she said			2
she was a ' vulnerable young woman ' in the company of ' less desirable ' people who bullied her into making the allegation and it was not her who initially reported the complaint			0
given her lack of co-operation with the police it was hard for her to admit she had lied and her refusal to give a video interview was an acceptance that ' what she was doing was wrong and she no longer wished to pursue the matter			2
' by june last year she freely admitted the matter			0
she had difficulty in managing her everyday life and her two sons aged one and three lived with her mother			0
there was a real likelihood she would lose her home and children if jailed			0
but judge @entity27 said the false allegation , the ' shame and degradation ' suffered by mr @entity13 through his false arrest and her previous conviction for a similar offence made jail inevitable			0
' it is important that people understand that a false allegation of rape is a wicked thing to do , ' he told her .			0
