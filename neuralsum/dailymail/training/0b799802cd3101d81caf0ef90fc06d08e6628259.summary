@entity1 boss @entity0 believes his side 's victory over @entity4 can act as a calling card for their @entity7 credentials			1
the @entity1 ' top - flight return went without a win for the first 10 games of the season but , just as questions were being asked about whether it might stay that way until may , they turned over the @entity16 before the international break			1
@entity0 is too pragmatic a coach to get carried away , especially with his side still propping up the rest of the division , but he is content that the 1 - 0 success shows @entity1 are not out of their depth among the elite			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 said the club set down a marker with their first @entity7 win of the season ' one win is n't like we 've won the @entity31 , one win is us laying a marker down and now we 're looking to move it forward , ' he said			1
' you get that first win and everybody feels a bit better about life			2
' that 's all we were looking for , that first marker to say we 're in the @entity7 and we 're in here for a reason			0
' the players have had a lot of exposure for the wrong reasons this season , with this talk of " could they win a game , when would they win a game ? " @entity1 's @entity53 celebrates after netting the only goal of the game against @entity4 ' it 's all so heavily covered that players can get influenced by that over time			1
i do n't think mine have but they could be			0
' having had a fortnight to reflect on their winning effort at @entity64 , @entity0 takes his side to ninth - placed @entity66 on saturday			1
and he is clear about that fact that the first win of the campaign represents the start of the job , not an end in itself			0
' it 's only one win and we need a lot more , ' he said			0
' we 're bottom of the pile , so we 've got to achieve things beyond what we 've done so far			0
@entity53 gives the @entity4 keeper no chance with a towering header from @entity85 's cross ' we 're not thinking we 're going to roll into town and pick up three points every week but we feel we can be competitive and that win reinforces our beliefs			2
' @entity0 hopes to have a strong squad to call on at the @entity91 , though striker @entity92 is still working his way back from a knee injury that has kept him out since march			1
@entity92 is back in first - team training but not yet match ready , but there is better news elsewhere			0
' we 're not defining when @entity92 will be back but he 's going well , ' said @entity0			2
' @entity98 is back to what you 'd consider full fitness and @entity102 had a knock with the @entity104 but we do n't think that 's too serious			0
' @entity106 is back too after a hamstring injury , so the squad is coming back to full health			0

@entity1 got their first win of the season against @entity4 , beating them 1 - 0
@entity0 said everybody at the club now ' feels better about life '
@entity1 travel to the @entity91 next to face @entity66
