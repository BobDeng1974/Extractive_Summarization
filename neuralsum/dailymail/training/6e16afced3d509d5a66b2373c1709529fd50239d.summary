after being stolen from her eight years ago , single mother @entity0 had come to terms with that fact that she would never see her @entity3 again			2
the dog was taken from her @entity5 , @entity6 home when it was just two years old , and ms @entity0 has since moved halfway across the country - all the way to @entity9 , @entity10			1
so it is safe to say she was a little shocked when she received a phone call , telling her @entity13 had been found dumped by the roadside in @entity5 , @entity15			1
reunited : recent pictures of @entity13 , who has been returned to her owner eight years after being stolen even once ms @entity0 , 34 , had heard the incredible news , it looked like they might never be reunited - as making the near 3,000 mile round trip looked an impossible task			1
as a working single mother she was not able to drive the mammoth trip , and because of the condition @entity13 was in , putting in her a crate in the hold of a plane would have been too much stress for her to take			0
as soon as the amazing story had begun , it looked as if it might end tragically , and ms @entity0 was faced with the horrifying call of having her long - lost dog put down			1
it was only by complete chance that a worker at the shelter @entity13 had been taken to happened to have a friend moving to @entity10 , and they said they would drive the dog there and reunite her with her overjoyed owner			1
great to be back : @entity0 and @entity13 were overjoyed to be brought back together ' i stopped in the driveway entrance of the lot and ran over to her , ' she told @entity49			2
' i ca n't really put into words the feelings because i just kept saying thank you , thank you , thank you so much			0
i never thought i would see her again â€” in came the tears and boo - hooing			0
' she said @entity13 rolled over onto her back to have her tummy scratched when they were reunited , and then rode home with her in the front seat , head flopped in her lap. she wrote on her @entity61 page , set up to get donations to help pay for the dog 's veterinary care : ' @entity66 is n't the word ... i cried like a baby at hearing she was found			2
but , of course , i knew if someone had turned her in , it was because they were done with her			0
' when @entity13 was found she was in awful condition - she had tumours , periodontal disease and heartworms , along with other conditions			2
she couple who found her had taken her to the vets , but could not afford to pay for the treatment			0
and it was only when she was taken to a shelter , where her microchip was scanned , that @entity13 was linked back to ms @entity0			1
bark to the future : @entity13 at ms @entity0 ' home when she was just two years old , before she was stolen rare : the all - while @entity3 's puppies would have been worth around $ 4,000 each to the thieves it is believed that whoever had stolen @entity13 had used her to breed puppies , and dumped her when she became too ill to be useful			1
' i ca n't see someone having a dog for that long and not creating some attachment to it , ' ms @entity0 told @entity100			1
' apparently she was just a puppy mill for him and when she could no longer be used , they dumped her			0
' what are the chances of us four crossing paths in this manner ? this was n't supposed to happen and it did			0
' white bulldogs are very rare , and @entity3 's puppies could have made as much as $ 4,000 each for the people who took her			0
now that the miracle is complete ms @entity0 is doing her best to give her the best possible end to her traumatic life			2
she has set up a @entity118 page called ' @entity120 ' to try to raise the $ 5,000 she needs to pay for her veterinary care			0
' she 's had a hard life and i just want to make her as comfortable as possible while she 's home , ' she said			0
ms @entity0 said that her 14 - year - old son , who was just eight when the pet disappeared , was delighted to see her again .			1

@entity13 was stolen from @entity0 ' @entity129 home
after giving up on finding her , she moved *1,500* to @entity9 , @entity10
got a call from a shelter saying that the dog had been handed in
had been found by a couple on the roadside in @entity5 , @entity15
ms @entity0 could not go to *collect* @entity13 , and the dog was too ill to *fly*
was faced with the awful *decision* of having her long - lost pet put down
but a good @entity143 from @entity5 who was moving to @entity10 *offered* to drive her back , completing the miracle
