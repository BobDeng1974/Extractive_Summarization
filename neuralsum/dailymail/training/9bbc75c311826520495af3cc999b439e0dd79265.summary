councillor @entity0 who pressed the for button when he meant to vote against a 260 housing development it was a simple but crucial action to determine if a quiet market town would be changed forever by an estate of 260 new homes			1
just a push of a button on a motion he had proposed himself would register the strong opposition of councillor @entity0			1
but he made a basic and far - reaching error , pressing the wrong button – ‘ for ’ instead of ‘ against ’			1
this left the vote tied and the chairman then used his casting vote to over-ride fierce local resistance and back the controversial scheme			2
previously mr @entity0 , 75 , had said the new homes on a field at @entity24 , @entity25 , would ‘ stick out like a sore thumb ’			1
news of the @entity29 district councillor ’s blunder has infuriated residents as much as the housing development			1
fellow councillor @entity32 said : ‘ it is a scandal and the decision should not have been approved			1
‘ it calls the whole democratic process into question			2
it ’s an absolute disgrace that these plans have gone through on the back of a human error			1
’ @entity42 mayor @entity41 said : ‘ i ’m furious that this application has gone through as a result of what would seem to be a mistake and that this beautiful part of @entity48 , just outside our town , is going to be built on			1
’ @entity51 , 83 , a retired electrical engineer who objected to the scheme , said he was ‘ appalled ’ at the councillor ’s error on the electronic voting system			1
‘ this is so clumsy , ’ he said			2
‘ the future of this small town hangs on what he did			0
it ’s going to be terrible			0
anybody can make a mistake , but i am surprised it ca n’t be rectified			2
’ another objector @entity64 said : ‘ it ’s disgraceful			0
he has been a councillor for many years			2
i am appalled by what ’s happened and he has no excuses			0
’ mr @entity0 did not ask for the vote to be taken again during the meeting but apologised later			1
‘ i pressed the wrong button , that ’s all that went wrong and i would rather it had n’t happened , ’ he said			0
‘ i am disappointed really , i am sorry that ’s what happened			0
’ his blunder was raised at the planning meeting immediately after the result was announced			0
chairman @entity77 commented : ‘ he has pressed the wrong button then			0
’ the planned controversial housing estate on a green site in @entity80 is now going ahead in a major blow for campaigners who believe the development is too big and out of place , mr @entity77 added : ‘ that stands , that ca n’t be undone			1
’ @entity87 received more than 51 letters of objection from residents and the local town council also wanted the housing estate to be blocked			0
the plans to build 210 houses and 50 flats on a farmer ’s field will drastically increase the town ’s population from its current figure of under 3,000			1
in june , the same committee rejected a similar application from the same company , @entity102			2
however , the plans were revised to take account of objections and this time planning officials had recommended that councillors approve the venture			2
there are three buttons for councillors during meetings marked ‘ for ’ , ‘ against ’ and ‘ abstain ’			0
@entity24 residents ptotest at the site where 260 new houses are planned a spokesman for the district council said there were no written procedures covering mistakes in using the system			1
he added that it would have been left to the chairman ’s discretion on how to respond to the error			0
‘ members were given training two years ago on how to use the system , ’ said the spokesman			0
‘ we have had no problems with the system to this date			0
’ after winning backing for its plans for the homes estimated to have a sales value of £ 25 - £ 50million , @entity131 confirmed that it will market the scheme to builders			1
the firm said it was unlikely work will start before the middle of next year but declined to comment any further .			0

voted for the application giving the go - ahead to build 260 homes on *farmland*
@entity151 says decision could not be *overturned* without making a *revocation* order , which could give rise to a *costly* *compensation* *payment*
plans ' are too big and outside @entity24 *'s* development limits '
