with the @entity1 voting on plans that would see all washing - up gloves rigorously tested — meaning prices will rise by 20 per cent — should you stock up on before it ’s too late ? @entity6 rolled up her sleeves to find out			1
the original — and best ? @entity9 by @entity10 @entity11 , £ 2.50 , @entity12 the glove : thick yellow latex , with roll - top cuffs			1
@entity16 - lined for comfort			1
the test : rubber gloves were created in 1889 by a surgeon to protect the hands of medical staff , with the first marigolds made in 1947 for domestic use			1
@entity25 road - test them on a two - day - old lasagne dish that is encrusted with burnt cheese and mince			1
although the water is scaldingly hot , i do n’t feel the heat and even use my rubber - covered fingers to chip away stubborn bits of food			1
@entity35 @entity36 , £ 2.99 , lakeland.co.uk the glove : certified to eliminate bacteria such as e-coli , salmonella , listeria and @entity41			0
also recommended for skin that ’s sensitive to latex or nitrile ( a type of rubber )			1
the test : according to @entity48 , 6 per cent of us have a rubber latex allergy			1
but adding an anti-bacterial element seems excessive			0
surely you are protecting yourself from harmful bacteria by wearing a glove in the first place ? but they fit well and unlike others , these are n’t too thick — my fingers easily pick up the smallest of teaspoons from the sink			0
a killer pair insulated @entity64 , £ 23.99 , wayfair.co.uk insulated @entity64 , £ 23.99 , wayfair.co.uk the glove : protects your hands when handling hot food			0
the test : as well as being very expensive , these are thick , heavy and an ominous dark , shiny grey			1
my husband walks into the kitchen and asks : ‘ have you killed someone ? ’ — and they do look like something a criminal would wear to clean up a murder ! i cook chicken nuggets to perform a heat test			1
i try to scoop them from the baking sheet , but have to concentrate jolly hard because the gloves are so padded with insulation that dexterity is limited			1
but i do n’t sustain any heat - related injuries , which is the point ( they only withstand temperatures of up to 120c , though )			1
when washing up , you ca n’t feel hot water , but it ’s tricky picking up small objects ( or even plates for that matter )			1
fails the @entity96 true @entity98 , @entity97 , £ 9.99 , lakeland.co.uk the glove : thick and latex - free			1
extremely resistant to strong household cleaners			0
the test : a very thick glove , and they feel cumbersome on			2
they keep my hands safe in very hot water , but the loose fit means that it ’s not very easy to pick up a teaspoon			2
they ’re also machine washable			0
after cleaning the downstairs loo , i pop them in a wash with tea towels			0
the next morning , they still are n’t dry , however , so i ’m not sure i ’d recommend it			0
@entity118 , 59p , @entity119 @entity120 @entity118 , 59p , @entity119 the glove : non-slip grip moulded in			0
the test : look and feel like the cheap option			2
my six - year - old says the inside ‘ smells disgusting ’			2
they ’re much thinner than the others , and in hot water my hands are sticky and warm after a few minutes			0
i ’d recommend more expensive gloves			2
super @entity132 @entity133 , £ 2.40 , bizzybee.co.uk the glove : one glove has a non-scratch scouring palm ; the other is left plain for easy handling			0
the test : i often make bacon sandwiches and hot chocolate on a saturday morning			2
this means somebody ( me ) has to wash up a greasy pan and a milky pan afterwards			0
the gloves have scouring pads running up the fingers and over the top of the finger on the right hand so you can get to tricky corners			2
they are absolutely brilliant — except for left - handers			2
@entity155 while you scrub ! @entity157 , £ 3 , bizzybee.co.uk the glove : latex free , with luxury lining			0
the test : the inside is so soft it feels like you ’re wearing cashmere ( to clean the house — how posh ! )			2
they look elegant and are comfy , too , while my dexterity with them on is excellent			0
after washing up , the plates are sparkling and my hands are so soft it ’s as if i had a housekeeper do the work for me			1
@entity172 @entity174 wonders @entity175 , £ 2.59 , ocado.com the glove : heavy - duty rubber with extra-comfy cotton lining			0
the test : i do n’t really ‘ do ’ stuff outside , but i decide to wash my car , which is encrusted in mud			0
sure enough , the heavy - duty rubber means my hands do n’t get dried out from repeated dipping in the hot water			0
as an extra test , i tidy up a load of leaves with my hands , which is very easy in these gloves .			1
