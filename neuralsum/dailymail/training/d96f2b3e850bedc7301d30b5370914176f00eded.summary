by @entity0 on the run : dangerous armed robber @entity2 has walked out of @entity3 - the second time he has gone on the run in two years an open prison has a staggering 90 inmates on the run , it emerged last night			1
they include at least one murderer , burglars , firearms criminals and fraudsters – some of whom absconded from jail years ago			2
the revelations about @entity3 in @entity19 will intensify the row over whether the wrong convicts are being sent to open conditions to ease pressure on @entity25 ’s packed jails			1
local @entity27 mp @entity26 and the @entity28 said mistakes were being made because of ‘ constraints ’ in the prison service			1
mr @entity26 warned : ‘ the risk assessment of prisoners who are being sent to @entity3 open prison is clearly not vigorous enough			1
‘ i sense that because of the constraints on capacity in the prison service that mistakes are being made in that assessment process			1
’ @entity41 , general secretary of the @entity28 , said his members were noticing ‘ time and time again ’ that the wrong sorts of prisoners are being placed in open conditions			0
he added : ‘ there are n’t enough prison officers because of budget cuts , we ’re too overcrowded , mistakes are being made , and i think people are being rushed through the system incorrectly			1
’ in a sign of a worsening overcrowding crisis , 40 prisons across @entity55 and @entity56 were instructed to raise their ‘ operational capacity ’			0
this is a tactic used by prison bosses to create more space in the system by , for example , re-opening disused cells			2
hot spot : several men , including blood , have been able to walk out of @entity3 , pictured , in recent weeks earlier this week , the @entity69 revealed how @entity70 , which released the latest figures about @entity3 , had taken four years to tell the public a savage murderer had gone missing from the prison			1
@entity75 – whose fatal stabbing of a @entity78 theatre manager shocked the country in the 1970s – walked out in june 2010 , less than a year after being moved to open conditions			1
but , despite police considering the killer too dangerous to approach , not a single appeal was made for help in catching the 57 - year - old until this week			1
officers said they had decided to act only after deciding he was probably no longer hiding in @entity89			0
violent armed robber @entity2 is the latest inmate to go on the run from @entity3 open prison after he absconded on thursday			1
the 48 - year - old was serving a life sentence for a robbery on a post office in @entity97 , @entity98 , in 2000			2
he is the 23rd convict to abscond from the prison since november last year			2
last month violent robber @entity101 also absconded from @entity3 , but was arrested in @entity102 yesterday morning			1
blood is 6ft1in , of small build with brown eyes and cropped black hair , and is thought to have links to @entity108 and @entity109			2
@entity111 @entity110 said : ‘ because of @entity114 ’s record , we have to consider that he could pose a threat to the public			0
i would urge anyone that sees him to contact us on 999 rather than approaching him			0
’ responding to the latest figures , they denied being too slow to act in identifying and tracing absconders			0
supt @entity124 said the force made ‘ some very quick and positive steps ’ and had arrested 23 absconders in recent months			1
around 23 people disappear from the prison each year			2
he said police did not routinely make media appeals to the public when prisoners went missing but considered each case individually , taking into account the risk			2
he added the vast majority were serving jail terms for offences such as fraud , dishonesty and theft , telling the @entity144 : ‘ we are absolutely confident the risk to the public remains low			0
’ in november , the force found there was a number of people who had absconded whose cases had not been regularly reviewed , and a dedicated team was set up to review each case			2
a spokesman for the @entity156 said : ‘ the justice secretary has been clear that keeping the public safe is our priority and has ordered immediate and major changes to tighten up temporary release processes and open prison eligibility			2
’ he added that abscondments had reached record lows under this government and were down 80 per cent over the past ten years , and insisted every incident was taken seriously , with police contacted as a matter of urgency			0
controversy has been raging for two months over convicts absconding from open jails			2
it was sparked by the disappearance of an armed robber known as the @entity176			0
@entity177 , 55 , walked out of a @entity179 jail last month , holding up a building society in @entity181 before being caught			0
killers and other violent criminals have been able to walk out of jail in recent months			0
in almost every case police warned the public these men should not be approached			0
murderer @entity189 , 53 , walked out of prison and went on the run for nine years – even claiming benefits , obtaining a passport and going abroad on holiday			1
the disappearance of the @entity196 should have triggered a manhunt after he absconded from a @entity199 open prison in 2005			1
but local police refused to look for him , leaving him free to reinvent himself as a respectable member of society			0
murder victim : @entity206 , left , with his younger brother @entity207			0
@entity189 and his girlfriend attacked @entity177 with a wrench , hammer and knife before writing ' @entity212 ' on the wall with his blood the habitual armed robber dubbed the @entity176 robbed a building society of almost £ 20,000 while on the run from open prison			1
@entity177 , 55 , was handed his 14th life sentence last month - but could be out again in ten years			0
he admitted holding up the @entity220 in @entity221 - on - @entity222 , @entity181 , four days after absconding from an open prison in @entity179			1
he was already serving 13 life sentences at the time , and failed to return from day release on may 3			0
violent : skull cracker @entity177 as he pointed a gun at staff while robbing a building society while on the run from an open prison police also took four years to warn the public that a dangerous murderer was on the run from an open prison			1
police have no idea where he is : murderer @entity75 ( above ) has been on the run since fleeing an open prison four years ago @entity75 , who was convicted of stabbing a @entity78 theatre manager to death , walked out of @entity3 prison in june 2010			1
police considered him so dangerous that he should not be approached by the public , but not a single appeal was made for help catching him until yesterday			1
@entity75 , 57 , had been in open conditions for less than a year when he absconded from the prison near @entity251 , @entity19			1
officers said they had decided to act only after concluding he was probably no longer in the county			0
@entity27 mp @entity254 , who has campaigned for tighter rules on open prisons , said : ‘ it is quite extraordinary that this is only just coming to light now			0
the public should have been informed straight away			0
‘ people need to know for their own safety			0
if the authorities had to make an announcement every time somebody absconded , i suspect a much more robust system would soon be put in place			0
’ @entity75 was jailed indefinitely at the @entity268 in december 1974 for a crime that shocked the nation			1
the sentence – in this case , the juvenile equivalent of a life term – meant he would be detained until the prison authorities decided it was safe to release him .			0
