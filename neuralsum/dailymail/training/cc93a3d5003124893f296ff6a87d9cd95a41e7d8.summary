during the speech , she said : ‘ i heard they 're calling us colonialist			0
... one is always tempted to respond , but i think it 's better to avoid it			0
when they say these things it 's exactly because they do n't have reasons or arguments			2
’ joke : president @entity8 makes light of her recent health scare as she shows off a deep wound on her neck scarred : the deep wound from surgery on her thyroid is clearly visible @entity3 has called on @entity5 to negotiate the sovereignty of the remote @entity42 archipelago it calls the @entity6			1
@entity5 has maintained a military presence there since liberating the islands in 1982 from an ill - fated @entity3 attempt to take them back			1
some @entity5 analysts have accused @entity3 of saber - rattling as the 30th anniversary of that war nears , but @entity53 has insisted on a peaceful resolution			1
she took another step , announcing that she 's making public the ‘ @entity57 , ’ a long - secret analysis of @entity3 leadership failures that called the war a ‘ military adventure ’ and recommended criminal penalties for those responsible			1
the report was prepared in 1982 , just before the end of @entity3 's dictatorship , but was kept classified to keep anyone from being punished			1
@entity53 sought to draw a clear line between what she called the militarism of other governments and the democracy she leads			0
pro-government protesters mount a forceful display outside the @entity76 as tensions rise over the @entity6 ‘ next year will mark 180 years since the usurpation by the government of @entity5 , which threw out the @entity3 who were there ( on the islands )			1
they want to make us out to be the bad and violent little ones , something we 're not , ’ she said			0
twice in recent days , pro-government protesters have been pushed back by riot police from the @entity76 in @entity88 , chanting and carrying signs demanding that @entity5 turn over the islands			1

she said : ‘ i was going to come with a handkerchief because it does n't look very aesthetic , ’ she said , referring to a deep horizontal crease just above her collarbone that appears to have healed nicely during her 20 - day medical leave			2

‘ you all know that aesthetics are very important to me , but i told myself , ' sweetie , politics before style			0
