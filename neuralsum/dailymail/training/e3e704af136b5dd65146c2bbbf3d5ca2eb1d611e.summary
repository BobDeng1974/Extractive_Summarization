by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 31 january 2013 the @entity1 already boast some of the weirdest festivals in the world , such as the bull running of @entity6 and the world ’s biggest tomato fight , but this one definitely tops the list			1
the annual @entity10 in @entity11 involves hundreds of villagers attacking a man dressed in a devils mask with 15,000 turnips			1
the best part ? no - one really knows why			0
a young man from the village is selected to be the ' @entity19 ' - the scape goat - and dresses up in a costume made from colourful strips of fabric , donning a devil - like mask with great horns and nose			1
turnip tradition : people throw turnips at the ' @entity19 ' as he makes his way through the streets beating his drum during the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity1 strange custom : the bizarre annual holiday sees a male villager dress up as devil - figure @entity39 and run through the streets of @entity11 whilst he is pelted with turnips turnip target : the @entity39 ' costume is made from hundreds of colourful strips of fabric and he wears a big mask with horns and a snout as he runs through the village banging a drum the @entity52 then enters the streets , banging his drum to call out the villagers who gather in their hundreds with armfuls of turnips			1
they chase the @entity60 around the village , continuously pelting him with the rock - hard root vegetables at every possible chance they get			0
it is a centuries long tradition and is celebrated every january on @entity67 in the village in @entity69 , western @entity1 which has just over 1,500 inhabitants			2
there are several theories behind the @entity52 tradition , most point to a connection between the festival and punishing cattle thieves			0
five - a - day : although the origin of the festival is undetermined , the vegetable pelting symbolise the expulsion of everything bad nowhere to run : as is tradition , the crowd has cornered the @entity60 outside the local church where they furiously throw the rock - hard turnips @entity90 turn - y tradition : every year hundreds travel to the little village in @entity69 , which has 1,500 inhabitants , to pelt a man in devil costume with big root vegetables theory is that the pelting of the @entity60 with turnips originates in the punishment and expulsion of a cattle thief by @entity101 , witnessed by the first conquerors			1
another is that it mirrors the punishment of the cattle - thieving giant @entity105 by @entity107 in @entity109 mythology			0
however , in modern times , @entity52 is a devil figure and the turnip throwing symbolise the expulsion of everything bad			0
the @entity10 is not the only odd celebration in @entity1 - and surprisingly not the only one which involves throwing vegetables			1
lads game : the part - takers in the turnip - throwing is predominantly young men who compete in throwing the most turnips the hardest feeding the beast : the village imports 14,000 turnips every year to throw at the @entity19 @entity126 is an annual food fight in @entity128 , @entity129 which sees thousands of people travel from all over the world to thrown tomatoes at each other			2
last year over 50,000 participants threw more than 150,000 rotten tomatoes on the streets – a tradition which has been going on since 1945			0
bull runs are held across @entity1 but the most popular one is the annual run in @entity6 , which is broadcast live on television			1
about 200 - 300 people are injured in the @entity6 bull run every year , and 15 people have died since 1910			0
most were gored to death by the 18 - strong bull heard			0
annual madness : the centuries old @entity52 festival takes place annually every january 19 - 20 on @entity67 duck : two women take cover behind a door grate at the @entity60 , already wading through turnips , makes his way through the streets beating his drum job done : this year 's ' @entity19 ' , @entity160 , 26 , is cheered on by the crowds after his run through the village is finished			2
