click here for all the facts and stats from a dramatic game in west @entity4 click here for @entity7 's ratings on wednesday the preening figure of @entity9 will arrive at @entity10 wearing the colours of @entity13 champions @entity12			0
if @entity15 are to emerge unscathed from a clash against @entity18 ’s team , they will need to buck up their ideas			2
here at @entity21 @entity20 was brutal in his assessment after @entity15 recorded one of the flukiest victories in the history of the @entity26			1
here 's how the drama unfolded : 86 mins - @entity15 lead 1 - 0 after an earlier @entity49 own goal 87 - @entity50 scores to make 1 - 1 90 - @entity51 makes it 2 - 1 @entity15 92 - @entity50 heads in to make it 2 - 2 95 - @entity30 own goal makes it 3 - 2 @entity44 are entitled to feel rotten			1
‘ it was fortunate , we were nowhere near our capacity and it has been like that for much of the season , ’ he admitted			0
this was a day when @entity15 got lucky , winning when they should probably have been beaten by @entity66 ’s hardworking @entity65 team			2
for good measure @entity40 , the captain of this @entity15 team , clobbered his team - mates			2
‘ everything needs improving , ’ he added and it is impossible to disagree			0
it certainly takes some explaining how four goals were scored in the final seven minutes of this extraordinary fixture			2
@entity15 relied on two own goals , some calamitous defending and the ultra-generous timekeeping of referee @entity78 to string together their second successive victory			1
‘ the win moves us up to fifth , ’ added @entity20 , but the way @entity15 have been playing of late , it needed checking just to be sure			1
@entity65 hit the woodwork twice in the first half through @entity85 and @entity15 were there for the taking			1
@entity49 ( right ) diverts a cross from @entity89 into his own goal as @entity91 ( left ) is left helpless @entity15 's players celebrate going 1 - 0 up as @entity93 is left to rue his own goal @entity50 ( left ) equalises for @entity44 with four minutes of normal time remaining at @entity21 @entity51 , on as a second - half substitute , scores to make it 2 - 1 to @entity15 @entity51 is mobbed by his team - mates are scoring in injury time to make it 2 - 1 to @entity15 @entity50 ( second left ) watches on as his header goes in after @entity103 ( second right ) fails to clear @entity50 's header appeared to go over the line but there was some doubt until goal - line technology cleared up the confusion @entity50 is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring his second goal of the game to make 2 - 2 deep into injury time @entity44 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity91 7 ; @entity113 6.5 ( @entity114 45mins , 6 ) , @entity93 6.5 , @entity30 6.5 , @entity115 6 ; @entity116 6.5 , @entity117 7 ( @entity118 60mins , 6 ) , @entity119 7 , @entity120 6.5 ; @entity121 7 ( @entity50 , 79mins , 8 ) , @entity122 7 subs not used : @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 scorers : @entity50 , 87 , 90 booked : @entity93 , @entity119 @entity15 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : mignolet 6.5 ; @entity89 6.5 , @entity129 6 , @entity130 5.5 , @entity131 6 ; @entity132 7.5 , @entity40 7 ; can 6.5 ( @entity103 , 66mins , 6.5 ) , @entity27 8.5 ( @entity133 , 90mins , 6 ) , @entity134 7 ( @entity51 , 66mins , 7 ) , @entity135 6 subs not used : @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 scorers : @entity93 67 ( og ) , @entity51 90 , @entity30 90 ( @entity142 ) booked : @entity89 , @entity129 , @entity51 referee : @entity78 attendance : 18,069 ratings by @entity146 they have lost their pizzazz and the aura has gone after @entity150 hot - footed it to @entity152 for £ 75million in the summer			1
instead they have @entity135 , one of the most disengaged footballers that @entity156 football has ever had the misfortune to be associated with			2
he does @entity15 no favours			2
it can only be a matter of time before one of his team - mates really gets tucked into him if he continues to play as half - baked as this			0
missing a couple of sitters from close range is just about acceptable for one of the world ’s leading forwards if you ’re putting in a shift			0
@entity135 does n’t seem bothered			2
back to the goals , because hours of fun will be had with the @entity15 players in the video analysis room before @entity12 arrive for their @entity176 clash			1
they went ahead when @entity49 extended his record of own goals in the @entity26 to 10 after awkwardly hooking @entity89 ’s right - wing cross beyond @entity91			1
just over 10 minutes later @entity182 ’s head coach @entity181 , who failed to make any attempt to communicate with @entity20 over @entity27 , had seen enough			1
by the time he arrived back at his new home in fashionable @entity187 and put the kettle on , four more goals had been scored			1
@entity66 had sent for @entity50 , who scored twice for @entity189 in a friendly against @entity191 last week , to come off the substitutes ’ bench			1
his first goal for @entity65 was scored in the 90th minute when he read @entity196 ’s knockdown and rippled the back of @entity199 ’s net with a tidy finish			1
that made it one - apiece and if @entity78 had whistled there and then , everybody associated with both teams would have gone home happy			0
it did n't work out that way			0
instead @entity15 raced up the other end and @entity51 , another substitute , sent a low , angled drive beyond @entity211			2
at times like this , for a team with the ambitions of @entity15 and plenty of experience , they should be home and hosed			1
instead , they were pegged back again			0
@entity129 and @entity130 , stationed in the heart of @entity15 ’s defence , could n’t live with the darting runs of @entity50			1

everybody was getting a hug			0
then the sickener as @entity27 , decent without being at his spell - binding best , struck gold when his cross was met by the foot of @entity30			1
an entire stadium collectively screamed ‘ no ’ , but his leg was already extending and he guided the ball beyond the @entity65 keeper to give @entity15 this improbable victory			0
@entity66 knew it , arriving for his post-match duties with a face like thunder after @entity65 bizarrely sent the troops into @entity199 ’s penalty area for @entity85 ’s free - kick when the score was 2 - 2			0
‘ what were they doing ? ’ asked @entity66 and it was n’t the moment to break the silence			0
‘ they thought we could win it , ’ he added in exasperation			0
@entity44 are doing their best to go straight back down , to undo all the good work after they were promoted from the @entity294 on that barmy day at @entity295 when @entity121 got their winner against @entity297			0
he had coffee with @entity261 on friday night , paying the bill after their 20 minute chat left him in no doubt that @entity65 must start to improve			0
‘ looking at the list of names mentioned for the job there ’s no - one better than me to manage this team , ’ declared @entity66			0
he is a wounded man , upset that his managerial integrity has been questioned after a sticky run in the opening weeks of the @entity26 season			0
after his , he will wonder whether his luck really has run out			0
@entity181 enjoys a joke with @entity44 head of football operations @entity124 ( left ) before kick - off @entity27 greets young @entity44 fans as he warms - up before kick - off on his return to his old club a supporter poses with representatives from @entity320 - who sponsor @entity44 - before kick - off			1
