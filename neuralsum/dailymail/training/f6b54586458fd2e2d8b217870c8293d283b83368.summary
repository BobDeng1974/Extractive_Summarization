by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 09:02 est , 30 march 2013 as arguments over marriage equality rage on in the nation ’s capital a striking new map shows how many of the nation 's people may already have taken a stand in its favor			2
the social media world went red this week according to a newly released map by @entity12 that showed an overwhelming increase in users swapping out their profile pictures , many for pink - on - red equal signs			1
the @entity17 urged people on monday to change their @entity12 profile pictures to the sign to show their support of marriage equality in the midst of the @entity25 's hearings over two potentially nation - changing cases			1
changed : @entity12 saw an overwhelming 120 percent increase in users changing their profile pictures from the previous week , with the most user 's counties seen in brighter red seen it ? this is the original pink - on - red profile photo the @entity17 urged marriage equality supporters to place on their @entity12 page this week by tuesday @entity12 reported a 120 percent increase in profile picture changes from the previous tuesday			1
it was approximately 2.7 million people to be exact according to the social networking site			0
' while millions of @entity45 @entity12 users update their profile photos on a given day , we found that significantly more users -- roughly 2.7 million ( 120 % ) more , updated their profile photo on tuesday , march 26 compared to the previous tuesday , ' they wrote with their findings			1
the trend did not signify that all of those millions specifically switched to the pink - on - red equal sign , however			2
but they say the exact timing and irregularity suggest a substantial correlation			1
' we find that the increase in uploads does indeed start around the time when @entity17 began urging their @entity12 followers to change their profile photos at 1 p.m. est , ' they wrote			2
rise : this graph shows that when the @entity17 urged supporters to change their profile photos at 1pm , where the dashed vertical line is seen , a major rise was immediately seen in @entity12 updates in a graph showing the change , users ' profiles can be seen drastically updated compared to the previous days just after a dashed vertical line that marks the @entity17 's 1pm statement ( see above )			1
among those who swapped during this time were also to have certain demographics in common			0
most were around 30 years old , slightly more were women , and the users generally updated their profile more often than others			0
geographically the top 25 counties showing a change were also in college towns , the most active being @entity87 @entity86 's @entity85 , home to @entity89			0
others included the counties of the @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , university of @entity99 and the @entity100			0
symbols : an assortment of users ' personalized red and pink equal sign profile photos are seen after collected by the @entity17 @entity106 and @entity107 - where @entity17 is headquartered - also ranked highly while @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 had only slight increases			2
an overwhelming region of the country that showed less activity than others on the map were parts of the southeast , commonly known as the @entity119			0
' standing in support of marriage equality on social media , and bleeding the @entity124 red , sends a powerful message to the community -- particularly @entity128 youth -- that the majority of @entity45 are on the right side of history , ' @entity17 said in response to @entity12 's results on friday			1
' for a long time , when people stood up for a cause and were n't all physically standing shoulder to shoulder , the size of their impact was n’t immediately apparent , ' @entity12 wrote in close of their report			0
' but today , we can see the spread of an idea online in greater detail than ever before			0
