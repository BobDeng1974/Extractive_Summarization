by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 10:45 est , 5 november 2012 a mysterious hacker called ' pyknic ' launched a cyber assault on @entity4 websites and a @entity6 fan site last night in ' celebration ' of @entity8			1
for several hours , websites promoting @entity4 shows such as @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 displayed messages such as ' remember , remember the fifth of november - the gunpowder treason and plot			1
' the attacks are thought to be linked to the cyber-attack group @entity18 , which often uses a @entity20 mask from the film @entity21 as an emblem			1
on november 5th each year , the @entity23 celebrates ' @entity20 night ' , where town set off fireworks and burn effigies of the conspirator who tried to blow up the @entity29 in 1605			1
hacked : @entity4 websites were replaced with crude messages by hacker ' pyknic ' on sunday @entity4 and @entity6 were victims of an attack by hacker ' pyknic ' who left references to @entity20 in his wake in 1605 , @entity20 led a party of conspirators into the cellars of the @entity42 , and stowed 36 barrels of gunpowder			1
they planned to ignite the barrels when the unpopular @entity47 and his political elite were assembled in the chamber , and @entity20 hoped to install a catholic monarch back to the throne			0
when authorities learned of the plot , on november 1 , they appointed @entity55 to investigate - and he allowed the plot to continue , so that he and his men could catch the conspirators in the act			0
he discovered @entity20 hiding in the cellars in the early hours of november 5 , and the conspirator was tortured until he confessed - and then he was promptly executed			2
every year since , effigies of @entity20 are burned across the @entity23			0
users trying to visit the ' shows ' or ' @entity65 ' tabs on the @entity4 main site were instead directed to a black page with glowing lights , blasting music , and references to @entity8			1
it appeared that the defacement of the affected sub-sites was cleaned up in a couple of hours , with @entity4 and its various websites functioning normally again by late sunday evening			2
however , older versions maintained by search engines such as @entity78 and @entity79 still bore the message ' hacked by pyknic ' , referring either to an individual or a group			0
this was followed with a warning that ' user info ' and ' passwords ' had been exposed by the culprit			0
the message " remember , remember the fifth of november " suggested a link to @entity18 , a movement of cyber rebels which has appropriated much of the symbolism around today 's @entity8			1
@entity18 later denied responsibility for the @entity95 and @entity6 hacks - but said they had hacked the sites of banking company @entity97 , security software maker @entity99 and @entity100			1
the anonymous team say they have the account details and passwords of 28,000 @entity97 users , but the firm says it has no evidence of a software breach , and the websites all appear to be working normally			0
@entity4 hacked : users looking for information on shows were met with this distorted page put up by a hacker known as ' pyknic ' googled : searching for ' @entity114 ' still shows the ' hacked ' caption @entity20 ( known as ' @entity118 ' ) , depicted with his co-conspirators , was tortured when the plot unraveled the holiday is meant to mark the failed plot to blow up the country 's parliament in 1605			1
however , conclusively determining responsibility for such attacks can be nearly impossible			0
also defaced by ' pyknic ' was a @entity6 fan site , @entity127 , an act which drew a sympathetic message from the pop star on @entity131			2
" my little angels ! help is on the way , " the message read , adding that " haus of gaga techies will be on it ... to the rescue			0
" the site was soon restored			0
@entity18 and its offshoot @entity143 have been linked to a number of high - profile computer attacks and crimes , including many that were meant to embarrass governments , federal agencies and corporate giants			2
a spokesman for @entity154 declined to comment .			0
