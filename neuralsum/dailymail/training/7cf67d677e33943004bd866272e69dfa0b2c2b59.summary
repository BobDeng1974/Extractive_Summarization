by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 bowling coach @entity2 heaped praise on his bowlers as they closed in on victory over @entity7 at the @entity8 - a result that would see @entity11 's side win a test for the first time in 11 months			1
@entity14 quickly claimed the final two wickets of @entity7 's first innings during the morning session before @entity3 rapidly scored 205 for four to leave the tourists needing a world record 445 runs to win the third test			1
@entity11 and @entity3 have failed to win in their last 11 tests but brilliant spin bowling from @entity25 and @entity26 reduced the @entity27 to a perilous 112 for four at stumps			1
on the brink : @entity3 are closing in on victory against @entity7 at the @entity8 thanks to their bowlers proud : @entity3 bowling coach @entity2 was full of praise for his bowling unit on day four the tourists need 333 to win - having already lost their top four batsman - or they must survive a full fifth day with just six wickets left to scrape a draw			1
@entity2 told @entity37 : ' the impressive thing has been their attitude			2
they ’ve got stuck in and just gone and done their work and the results have come with that and that ’s testament to this group			0
' we ’ve got a young group , pretty much other than @entity14 ( @entity14 ) and @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , who have been really good in the way they have led us in theis @entity21			2
' with a particular mention for @entity14 , who finished the day with figures of none for 13 from eight second - innings overs to go with his first - innings haul of five for 53 , @entity2 added : ' he ’s gone back to that magnificent control			1
' we know he ’s got the skill but if he backs that up with the control and putting the ball in difficult position for the batters , he always gets those rewards			0
unit : @entity25 ( left ) and @entity14 ( centre ) were both pivotal to @entity3 's good bowling performance ' we had a big chat about making sure we put the ball in a position where it is tough for the batsman , and we then use our skills to maybe move the ball and that ’s pretty much what ’s happened so far this game			1
' and @entity2 is confident that his men can get the job done on thursday and finish off the tourists to level the series 1 - 1			0
he said : ' ( it ’s about ) running in and delivering the ball hard at a length , hitting the stumps as many times as you can and looking for the pads and the outside edge			0
' it was pleasing today because we did have a couple of half appeals with inside edges hitting the pads and we got past the outside edge a bit			0
' it ’s still going to be tough work for the seamers , there ’s no doubt about it			0
' acknowledgement : @entity14 ( left ) took two wickets on his 32nd birthday to secure a five - for			2
