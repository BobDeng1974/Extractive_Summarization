athletics , a sport tainted by regular drugs scandals , has nevertheless received the huge £ 200million - plus backing of @entity5 marketing giants @entity4 for the next 15 years			1
@entity4 will announce that they are renewing their agency partnership with the @entity7 — track and field ’s ruling body — until 2029			1
backing : lord @entity10 is favourite to succeed @entity7 president @entity11 @entity7 sources say the massive marketing and rights deal for a sport that has had more than its fair share of negative publicity will guarantee them a minimum £ 11m a year — with extra on a profit share — until 2019 and then £ 14m a year as a minimum for the next decade			1
the agreement will ensure @entity7 president @entity11 leaves the organisation in a healthy financial state when he steps down next year			1
the favourite to succeed @entity11 is @entity10 , who has enjoyed a good relationship with @entity4 since they became the @entity7 ’s marketing partners			1
the @entity5 agency would not have committed to such a long contract if they did not fully expect @entity10 to take the helm			1
@entity10 , who is sure to have a strong anti-drugs agenda when he launches his @entity7 election manifesto to the 212 voting associations , is likely to compete against @entity33 ’s pole vault great @entity34 for the @entity7 presidency			1
but the troubles in @entity33 and @entity34 ’s support for the overthrown @entity39 government , plus his rash challenge for the @entity42 presidency last year , has put @entity10 in pole position for the role he covets most			2
the football conference season starting this week might not quicken the pulse but that will not bother @entity48 , founder of the @entity49 in @entity50 of which he has sold a 50 per cent share to @entity52 for a reported £ 2.5m			0
former @entity53 employee @entity48 had previously sold and then bought back leaders on bargain terms from @entity57 ownership			2
new face : @entity60 's @entity59 ( left ) made his @entity53 international committee debut in @entity62 @entity59 , a journeyman lower league defender , was a long way from the @entity66 set - up as a player			2
but @entity59 , now @entity60 chief executive and a @entity70 board member , made his @entity53 international committee debut in @entity62 as part of the @entity66 party			2
he is one of the rare blazers who played football at a professional level			0
the @entity53 received presentations at their last board meeting on how tv rights partners @entity79 and @entity80 intend to heavily promote the @entity81 when coverage starts with the first round on november 8			1
but , embarrassingly for the @entity53 , there is still no sign of a new sponsor following @entity87 not renewing their contract			1
the @entity53 , chasing a £ 9m - a - year partner , revamped their commercial department by bringing in @entity92 - honed expertise			0
so far this has not worked , although the @entity53 are confident of signing a sponsor by the first round — if not , definitely by the flagship third round			2
carry on ranting , @entity97 @entity66 manager @entity102 ’s ‘ absolute f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * ’ briefing with the @entity99 would not have happened if @entity103 had their way			0
tough talking : @entity66 boss @entity102 let rip during press conference the @entity53 have been asked by @entity108 football ’s governing body to hold all - in media conferences with tv , radio and newspapers so rights holders do not miss the best story line that invariably comes from @entity99 rather than tv questioning			0
but the @entity53 , to their credit , intend to carry on with separate conferences , even if it involves @entity102 letting off steam			0
the story from the new @entity122 biography that @entity66 ’s @entity124 winning hero had been turned down for membership by @entity126 sparked clubhouse comment that the problem was more to do with @entity122 ’s entourage of drinking pals than the fabled footballer himself			0
it is also alleged @entity135 ’s clubhouse was set on fire shortly after @entity122 was snubbed			0
@entity137 , who made a memorable commercial deal with sports stars @entity140 and @entity142 , are understood to be top of the list to replace @entity145 , whose contract as @entity149 shirt sponsors expires at the end of the season			0
@entity145 have backed @entity149 since 2005 when former chief executive @entity152 said the club was going to ‘ paint the world blue ’ .			0

@entity5 marketing giants @entity4 to renew partnership with *atheltics*

@entity53 have still not found a new sponsor for @entity81
