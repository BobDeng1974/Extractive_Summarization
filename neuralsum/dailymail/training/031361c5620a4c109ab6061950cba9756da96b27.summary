a cancer doctor treating five - year - old @entity3 admitted the only treatment available on the @entity5 would leave him with life - long disabilities , his parents revealed yesterday			1
@entity7 and @entity8 were told conventional radiotherapy would leave their son with ‘ special needs ’ which could be avoided if he received pioneering treatment abroad			1
despite that admission , @entity5 doctors insisted they would go ahead with normal radiotherapy and threatened to have the horrified couple ’s parental rights removed if they questioned the decision , the family said			1
the family ’s plight shocked the world when the couple were arrested for child cruelty and thrown in jail while @entity24 was kept under armed guard , alone in a @entity45 hospital			2
his brothers and sisters were banned from seeing him , and his parents said he was left ‘ crying like a wounded animal through the night ’ in his single bed ward			0
now reunited , the family has secured his treatment in a private clinic and say the proton beam therapy – and their love – has already produced improvements in his health			1
agony : mr and mrs @entity3 said they were forced to take their desperately ill son on the run across @entity34 to protect him from the devastating side effects of the @entity5 treatment father : mr @entity3 , 51 , ( pictured with his son ) said he asked about proton beam therapy as an alternative several times , but was told it offered no benefits over normal radiotherapy in a moving and shocking interview serialised this week in the @entity27 , they tell how : @entity24 ’s initial operation to remove his brain tumour left him ‘ like a vegetable with his eyes open ’ his parents had to hold his eyelids shut to allow him to sleep his suffering was so shocking his mother questioned if it was right to keep him alive doctors said conventional radiotherapy would cause hearing and growth problems and leave him with special needs medics said the @entity5 would not fund proton beam therapy despite it offering a better quality of life the couple was told the @entity5 only considered ‘ survival ’ in cancer funding decisions , not the potentially devastating side effects mr and mrs @entity3 faced every parent ’s nightmare when @entity24 was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms			1
he was admitted to @entity100 for brain surgery and initially the couple were confident doctors were doing everything possible to save their son			2
mrs @entity3 , 45 , was arrested as she tried to get into an ambulance to accompany her five - year - old son to hospital but the family ’s own research into his condition led them to question the doctors ’ insistence that he needed high doses of radiotherapy which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue			2
mr @entity3 , 51 , said he asked about proton beam therapy as an alternative several times , but was told it offered no benefits over normal radiotherapy			1
one doctor was said to have told him : ‘ if you continue with these questions your rights to make decisions about @entity24 will be taken away from you			1
‘ we will apply to the family court to have your parental rights removed and then we will give him any treatment we want			1
’ mr @entity3 , a property developer from @entity134 , @entity135 , said he then asked a radiologist at the hospital and was told cancer treatment decisions were taken on the basis of ‘ survival rates ’ , not the patient ’s quality of life afterwards			2
the radiologist told him : ‘ if you ’re asking me about quality of life , proton is superior			2
‘ with radiotherapy , your son will get secondary tumours , have hearing problems , growth problems and special needs for the rest of his life			2
‘ children pay a heavy price for survival under normal radiotherapy			0
’ faced with such a grim forecast for their child ’s future , @entity28 and mrs @entity3 said they felt they had no option but to take @entity24 to @entity166 for treatment			2
when doctors discovered the boy was gone they contacted police , who issued a @entity34 arrest warrant for the couple			0
two days later the parents were arrested in @entity45 as they prepared to sell their holiday home to fund @entity24 ’s treatment			1
mrs @entity3 , 45 , was arrested as she tried to get into an ambulance to accompany her five - year - old son to hospital and heard police questioning their instructions			0

the outcry over the family ’s plight led to criticism that police and prosecutors had been too heavy - handed in issuing the @entity34 arrest warrant , which was eventually withdrawn			0
public anger also prompted a nationwide fundraising effort as people rallied to help the family			0
mr @entity3 described the emotional moment he was reunited with @entity24 , saying : ‘ i was hugging him			0
i could feel the pain inside him			0
desperation : mr @entity3 with his son in a video the family made explaining why they had taken @entity24 from hospital treatment : mr and mrs @entity8 , seen leaving a police station in @entity226 for an extradition court hearing , were arrested and thrown into cells in one of @entity45 ’s most notorious prisons for three nights ‘ i said , “ @entity24 i ’m here now			1

i ’m so sorry for what happened but we ’re here			0
we ’re going to be together forever			0
you do n’t have to cry any more			0
’ @entity24 has now begun treatment and the @entity5 has agreed to pay for his proton beam therapy in the @entity237 , meaning public donations can be used to help other children			1
doctors in @entity166 say his type of brain tumour has a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate and hope he will make a full recovery			0
