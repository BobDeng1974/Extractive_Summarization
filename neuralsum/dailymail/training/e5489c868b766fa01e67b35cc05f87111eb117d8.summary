a @entity1 woman who was the driver in a crash that killed her husband has been given the go - ahead to sue herself for negligence			1
the bizarre legal situation arose after @entity8 , as representative of her dead husband 's estate , filed papers suing herself as the driver , in order to claim damages against the insurance company			1
the december 27 , 2011 , accident occurred on @entity17 near @entity18 , about 225 miles east of @entity19			0
it was reported at the time she suffered a concussion , broken ribs , a shattered wrist and two punctured lungs , while her husband @entity27 was initially taken to hospital in critical condition before succumbing to his injuries			2
@entity8 , seen here two months after her devastating crash in 2012 , was badly injured			1
her dog @entity33 spent 53 days surviving in the wilderness , living off roadkill before he was found according to court documents , @entity8 as the estate representative seeks unspecified amount of damages for medical expenses , loss of financial support and the loss of her husband 's love and companionship , the @entity36 reported			1
the claim was initially denied by a district judge in january 2014 , only for it to be overruled on appeal			1
lawyers representing her in her capacity as estate representative said she was suing herself because legally , she had to act to benefit the estate			1
but those representing her in her own capacity as the driver said : ' if this suit is allowed to continue , a jury would be asked to determine whether @entity8 's fault caused @entity8 's own harm , ' the paper reported			1
@entity8 's husband @entity27 ( left ) died in the crash			1
@entity8 ( right ) is suing herself in an attempt to win compensation from her insurance company ' the jury would be asked to determine how much money will fairly compensate @entity8 for the harm she caused herself			1
the jury will be highly confused - it can not order a person to compensate herself			0
' the accident itself made headlines in 2012 because the couple 's @entity79 sheepdog @entity33 - in the car at the time of the crash - escaped unscathed , but spent 53 days surviving on roadkill and water sources before being found			2
at the time , she said : ' i would think about @entity33 constantly , ' she said			0
' there were tv commercials with dogs that made me think about him and cry			0
he 's just the sweetest dog			2
' the search for @entity33 was cancelled before it began after the january 6 discovery of what appeared to be the dog 's remains along the interstate			0
the same day , her husband died			0
' it was a horrible day for me , ' ms @entity8 recalled			2
' but something inside me told me @entity33 was still alive out there			0
i was n't 100 per cent sure , but i did n't grieve for @entity33 like i did for my husband and our other dog			0
' however , after several searched , a friend finally spotted @entity33 and managed to coax him into his jeep			0
dog and owner were reunited after 53 days .			0
