shockingly , at least eight of the beggars around the @entity18 city are not even homeless as they callously cash - in from kind - hearted shoppers			1
a homeless charity that works in @entity6 has said that not all beggars on the city streets earn big money ( picture posed by model ) some of them have started posing as @entity28 sellers as they rake in the equivalent £ 20 an hour			1

' we believe this man is not an official @entity28 magazine vendor but he " sells " the magazine in the city centre and then begs off the back of the sale			1
' he said another man can seen wandering the streets carrying a sleeping bag - something he does only for effect			0
sgt @entity35 added : ' his appearance is unkempt and dishevelled but this is an image that he portrays to gain public sympathy			0
illegal street beggars in one @entity4 city are earning up to £ 36,000 a year , police revealed yesterday ( file picture ) the beggars are said to be a mixture of nationalities but mainly @entity4 males from the @entity66 area			1
as well as spending their money on cups of coffee and food police say giving directly to beggars is merely funding their drug and alcohol habits			2
sgt @entity35 added : ' we have heard of several people who have boasted earning up to this amount ( £ 700 a week )			1
' during the season of goodwill , people are understandably more generous and beggars take advantage of their generosity			2
' begging is an offence and one we take seriously , the vast majority of beggars who purport to be homeless , are not			2
' the sad reality is that by giving directly to beggars is supporting a dug or alcohol habit			2
' we would urge people to give to a charity who will use that money to actually help people genuinely in need			0

' when he was arrested last week he had five pasties in his possession			0
he also had £ 52 cash			0
' but yesterday one beggar in the city centre - who did not wish to be named for fear of reprisals - said not all of them make that kind of money			1
the 57 - year - old said : ' we do n’t all make that sort of cash and genuinely need the help			0
' some of them are just con men who have come in and are muscling in on our patches			0
' there ’s nothing we can do about it - they are very aggressive and not the sort of people you want to cross			0
' @entity137 , manager of charity frameworks , which works directly with rough sleepers , added : ' not everyone who begs sleeps rough and not everybody who sleeps rough begs - in fact the majority do not			0
