@entity0 will face @entity1 in the @entity3 semi-finals after a hugely impressive takedown of @entity5			1
the 29 - year - old @entity6 is the prospective @entity3 semi-final opponent for the winner of the @entity1 - @entity10 clash after dismissing the world no 3 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 in two hours and 13 minutes			1
that brings into play the fascinating prospect of @entity1 being pitted against his long - time friend and former coach @entity15 , who has taken over the lead role guiding perennial nearly man @entity0			1
@entity0 celebrates his straight - sets win over @entity5 at the @entity3 @entity5 was shocked by @entity0 as he was beaten in straight sets in the quarter - finals the 28 - year - old @entity23 had left the employ of @entity1 in november after nearly five years working together , a decision that he told @entity22 last week was ' genuinely mutual '			1
explaining that the relationship had ' run its course ' he added : ' i will always be in @entity1 's corner , except when i am coaching against him			0
' afterwards a delighted @entity0 praised his new mentor , saying : ' it has been going really well and i 'm really happy with the way we are working together			0
he has given me a good plan and i 'm sticking to it			0
@entity0 started quickly and raced into a two - set lead dropping just two games on the way @entity0 played some excellent tennis - especially in the first two sets @entity0 's box celebrate as their man dominates @entity43 @entity5 in their @entity3 quarter - final while @entity1 's former coach @entity15 ( bottom right ) had his best poker face on ' @entity5 is a great fighter but i stayed focused and kept calm , i was ready for everything			1
' just how much impact he has made since they started working together last month – on the recommendation of @entity53 – was evident in the way the @entity6 tackled his long - time nemesis @entity5 , who he continually pushed way out of the court			2
they had faced each other 21 times before this with @entity0 winning only three			0
@entity5 had won the previous seventeen , a remarkable streak going back nine years that included the 2010 @entity64 final			2
@entity5 did threaten a comeback during the third set - but @entity0 held on @entity5 went through a range of emotions through the match despite taking the third set to a tie break , @entity5 was unable to force his way back into the match so there was going to be an enormous psychological hurdle to clear if he was going to dismiss the @entity43 and take advantage of his relative ring - rust coming into this event			1
by finally managing to defeat him again he joined @entity78 as the only player to have beaten all of the ' @entity81 ' ( @entity5 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity1 ) in grand slam play			2
it helped that @entity5 was totally off his game in the most bizarre way during the first two sets , seemingly bereft of energy and losing his first ' bagel ' set since 2011			2
however , he roused himself in the third to give @entity0 's notoriously frail nerve a real test			0
@entity0 remained strong in the third - set tiebreak to see it out and progress to the last four @entity0 's fiancee @entity97 looks relaxed as she watches her boyfriend beat @entity5 but the @entity6 , who last week became engaged to model @entity100 , kept up with those flatly struck groundstrokes executed with his easy power			1
after missing two match points at 6 - 5 in the third he went 5 - 1 up in the tiebreak , was pulled back to 5 - 4 , but just about closed it out 7 - 5			1
should he face @entity1 then there will be some fascinating dynamics at work			0
but no extraneous factors will alter the fact that he has made it into the last four without dropping a set , so he will be very formidable and supremely confident			0
as for @entity5 , he clearly needs more matches under his belt – and will probably start getting them next month when he heads to clay court events in @entity117			0
@entity5 could be seen taking a tablet early in the third set but he denied , despite his early sluggishness , having any physical issues , saying it was ‘ nothing important ’ .			0

@entity0 beat @entity5 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 at the @entity3
@entity6 star @entity0 will play @entity1 or @entity125 in the semis
the third set went to a tiebreak and @entity0 won it 7 - 5
