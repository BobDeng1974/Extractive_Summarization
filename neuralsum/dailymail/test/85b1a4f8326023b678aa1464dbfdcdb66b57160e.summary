@entity0 developed large kidney stones like many busy people , @entity0 often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch , and often barely stopped for a cup of tea			1
in fact , @entity0 , 63 , a musculoskeletal therapist from @entity6 , admits : ' i would often be so busy at the clinic that i 'd forget to drink any liquid at all , other than the odd cup of tea or coffee			2
it had been the same way for years - although i would drink more water at weekends			2
' last year , this habit caught up with him			0
he noticed a vague ache in his abdomen , stretching around to his back			0
' it was n't agonising but it just did n't feel quite right , so i went to the gp , ' he says			0
' as i had some bloating , he sent me for an ultrasound			2
' this revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result , his doctors believe , of his low fluid intake			1
a ct scan showed that the stones were so large ( 6 mm across ) they could not be passed naturally , and he needed surgery			1
one in ten of us will develop a kidney stone , and the numbers are rising dramatically			1
they are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys , which eventually build up into a solid lump			0
they can be excruciatingly painful - on a level , say experts , with childbirth			2
the stones often remain symptomless while they 're in the kidney			2
they start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter , the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder			2
' renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter , ' says mr @entity62 , consultant urological surgeon at the @entity63 , @entity64			2
the pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to ' writhe around in agony ' , he adds			0
the pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting			0
once on the move , a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body			2
in that time , it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back , groin or side , a need to urinate more than usual , and pain when urinating			0
sometimes , if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney , it can lead to a build - up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection			1
signs of this include a fever , shivering , extreme weakness , diarrhoea , or cloudy and bad - smelling urine			0
the bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing			0
emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent , according to official figures , rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year			1
meanwhile , the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period , rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340			2
the cause for his condition , doctors believe , was low fluid intake and bizarrely , it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym , and then not drinking enough , or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame , and may be why cases are going up , especially among women			1
' more men than women used to suffer from kidney stones , with a ratio of about three to one , ' says mr @entity62			1
' but an increasing number of women now get them , and the ratio is evening up			0
' the main cause of kidney stones is dehydration			1
' your kidneys are your waste - disposal system , ' explains dr @entity132 , the @entity133 of @entity135 ' clinical champion for kidney care			2
' they discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body , and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through			0
' but if you become dehydrated , you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone - forming chemicals , and these begin to bind together to build stones			1
' to avoid this , you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is ' the colour of white wine ' , says @entity152 - around 1.2 litres a day			0
you need more during hot weather or after exercise			0
changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up			1
' there has been a trend , especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle , to eat low - carb , high - protein diets , ' says dr @entity152			1
' the animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid ( a known stone - former ) in your urine			1
they also reduce the amount of citrate ( a stone - inhibitor )			1
' this can lead to uric acid stones forming , especially if you also do n't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job			1
' there are other causes , too			0
your kidneys remove sodium , which is the main component of salt , from your body			0
when they do this , they excrete calcium , too			0
but low - carb diets could also put you at risk so the more salt you eat , the more calcium you will have in your urine , which can build into stones			1
obesity is another risk factor			0
' obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance ( where the body ca n't use insulin effectively ) , ' says mr @entity62			0
this causes a change to the nature of urine , making it more acidic , which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney			1
eating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit , as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind			2
oxalate - rich foods include tea , spinach , rhubarb , nuts , strawberries , beetroot and chocolate			0
they are all fine in moderation , but avoid large daily quantities			0
if you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time , you should ask your gp for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones , which are caused by a build - up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections , adds dr @entity152			1
virtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally , with only prescription - strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens , says mr @entity62			2
but if a stone is bigger , you may need to have treatment			0
the most common is extracorporeal shock - wave lithotripsy ( @entity250 )			0
this involves sending shock - waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone			1
' this works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter , but not for bigger ones , or for stones that are very hard , ' says mr @entity62			0
' it 's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity , as the shock - waves have further to go to reach the stone			1
' for bigger or harder stones , a ureteroscopy is performed			0
under general anaesthetic , a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone			2
for very large stones ( those over 15 mm ) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( @entity277 ) is used			1
a nephroscope - a telescope - like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back			0
the stone is broken up using a combination of high - frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy ( a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road )			1
@entity0 had a ureteroscopy at the @entity290 , @entity6 , in september			2
' i was out the day after my surgery , and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days , thankfully i 'm now stone - free			1
' he knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle			0
' the lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place : proper hydration , low - salt , staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein , ' says mr @entity62			1
the @entity317 advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day , two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium : 50 - 75 g of red meat , chicken or fish ; two eggs ; Â½ pint of milk ; 50g cheese ; a small pot of yogurt			0
mr @entity62 also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily , as the citrate ( a form of acetic acid ) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances , such as oxalates , that lead to stones			1
today , @entity0 ensures that he gets enough fluid			1
' i did n't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones , ' he says			1
' i now drink water religiously ! '			0

doctors believe low fluid intake led to @entity0 's kidney stones
ultrasound and ct scan revealed two very large stones in his right kidney
one in ten of us will develop a kidney stone , and the numbers are rising
changing diet trends such as low - carb are also pushing sufferer figures up
' animal proteins break down into uric acid - a known stone - former '
