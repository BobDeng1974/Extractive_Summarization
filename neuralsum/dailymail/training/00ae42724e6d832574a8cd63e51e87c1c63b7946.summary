but when they placed them side - by - side , a more sinister story began to emerge			2
@entity13 immigration officials ’ suspicions were raised when they noticed several different couples were wearing exactly the same outfits to their weddings			0

with proof of their marriage , each man could apply to come to @entity35 to be with his wife , who was here legally as a result of @entity47 open border rules			1
the scam organisers thought that by holding the wedding ceremonies in @entity36 they would evade the scrutiny of register offices in the @entity35 , where officials are on the look - out for bogus couples			1
but clearly they needed to pay more attention to the details			0
same clothes : the traditional dress was the same in @entity60 wore as she smiled with her new ' husband ' not only were the garments the same , several of the weddings appear to have taken place in the same room , with the same broken clock on the wall			1

she also joined in the scam , staging her own wedding wearing the same outfit – and in the same room			1
a court heard that @entity26 was paid to get married three times in four months			1
three other fake brides , @entity73 @entity85 , 30 , @entity86 , 29 , and @entity87 @entity60 , 24 , also wore the red and yellow diamond - pattern shawl for their photos			1

’ in total 16 brides were prosecuted by @entity13 officials in several cases over the last year involving the highly organised sham marriage gang based in @entity112 , @entity113			2

@entity135 , from the @entity13 ’s @entity137 team , said : ‘ this has been a complex case , with our investigations stretching from the @entity35 to @entity36			1
the gang involved thought they had come up with an ingenious way of breaching @entity35 immigration laws			2
they were wrong , and as a result are now behind bars			0
