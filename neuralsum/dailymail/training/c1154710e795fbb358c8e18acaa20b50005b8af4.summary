by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor two former @entity3 appointees have met with federal prosecutors about the ' @entity6 ' fiasco , adding new fuel to the fire just weeks after a report commissioned by the @entity11 governor appeared to clear his name			1
former @entity14 official @entity13 and former christie chief counsel @entity15 have both begun the process of disentangling themselves from scandal swirling around the @entity20 governor , according to liberal bloggers at @entity22 and the online legal publication @entity24			1
@entity1 attorney @entity25 , the @entity11 prosecutor who succeeded @entity3 in that office , has begun presenting evidence to a grand jury			1
@entity30 press secretary @entity29 has been in and out of those proceedings			0
@entity13 put himself at the center of a plot to snarl traffic in a @entity11 town last september by giving the order to choke off traffic lanes leading to the @entity38 – in apparent retaliation for a @entity42 mayor 's failure to endorse @entity3 's re-election bid			1
@entity3 has insisted he knew nothing until later when media outlets began asking questions			0
but the @entity14 bigwig – a former @entity3 schoolmate assigned to a position created just for him – met last week with prosecutors to tell his side of the story			2
@entity87 was the governor 's chief legal adviser while the plot was taking shape , and likely has inside information about any role of the governor 's office had in coordinating the stories of officials connected to the scandal			1
@entity13 and fired @entity3 deputy chief of staff @entity98 , for instance , participated in the infamous email exchange that launched the investigation			1
' time for some traffic problems in @entity71 , ' @entity98 wrote him			0
' got it , ' he replied			0
@entity13 refused to testify before an investigative committee controlled by @entity42 in the @entity11 legislature			1
@entity3 fired her publicly in january			0
but @entity107 , another @entity14 higher - up , did testify in the fall , weeks before surrendering his job			2
@entity107 stuck to he ' traffic study ' story in a performance that @entity13 later said @entity87 praised			2
scene of the crime ? the rightmost lanes into this @entity38 entry plaza , normally reserved for traffic entering from the town of @entity71 , @entity11 , were repurposed for general traffic during a week in september , bringing traffic in that town to a screeching halt no love lost : @entity1 attorney for the @entity126 @entity25 is looking into whether his old rival @entity3 played a role in the @entity38 bridge fiasco alleged ringleader : former @entity3 deputy chief of staff @entity98 has refused to testify without a grant of immunity as @entity3 prepares for what observers expect to be a tumultuous presidential run in 2016 , his former underlings may be positioning themselves to cut deals with the government			1
@entity98 and @entity13 have both said through their attorneys that they would share what they know if they were promised immunity from prosecution			0
there has been no sign that their wishes have been granted , but @entity13 's cooperation may point in that direction			0
his attorney @entity152 did not respond to a phone message seeking comment			0
@entity25 , by all accounts a methodical and skilled federal prosecutor , reportedly holds no special place in his heart for the @entity11 governor who had the job before him			2
according to multiple witnesses at @entity3 's going - away party in the @entity1 attorney 's office , @entity25 – angry at @entity3 for taking so many skilled lawyers with him to the governor 's office – threw a copy of a @entity11 directory of lawyers at his feet , saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge			1
the @entity22 writer whose scoop re-energized the @entity6 story late on monday is another @entity179 partisan			0
@entity180 wrote on @entity22 that the march report clearing @entity3 ' is a steaming pile of crap , a classic @entity3 smear job , designed to reach the only result that might spare his political life			2
' ' now that @entity13 ’s talking , his days as governor are numbered -- in weeks and months , not years , ' a gleeful @entity180 predicted .			0

@entity13 , the @entity14 figure at the center of the @entity38 scandal , has met with the @entity1 attorney 's investigators
so has @entity15 , @entity11 gov. @entity3 's former chief legal counsel and a *longtime* *confidante*
the ' @entity6 ' plot was an apparent effort to *stymie* traffic entering the @entity38 as political *payback* against a @entity42 mayor
@entity1 attorney @entity25 , who succeeded @entity3 in the job , is probing the governor and his staff ; @entity3 says he knows nothing
@entity3 's job and presidential *ambitions* hang in the balance as former aides weigh testifying and he waits to see if their memories clash with his
