there are few things as annoying as leaving your house in a hurry , getting into your car and preparing to drive off - only to realise that the inconsiderate parking of someone else has blocked you in			0
an actor and comedian has channeled that feeling of frustration in an online video poking fun at a @entity15 blogger who moaned that his car was towed away			2
@entity17 ranted to his two million plus @entity15 subscribers about having to pay a $ 200 fine to retrieve his car after it was impounded because he was blocking someone 's drive ' just a little bit '			1
but @entity23 's witty riposte is sure to put the young ' vlogger ' in his place - or at least make sure he thinks twice about where he parks his car in future			0
directly addressing @entity17 , the comedian tells the camera that it was his driveway that the car was blocking			2
despite his friends ' encouragement to post a video online mocking @entity17 's own videos , he thought that might be a little cruel			2
but he claims to have changed his mind having seen @entity17 's rants			1
in a five point lecture , aimed at explaining why he had the car towed away and explaining that his driveway was more than ' just a little bit ' blocked , @entity23 shows a picture of a blue @entity42 parked right across a driveway			0
he points out to @entity63 , who complained in one of his videos that there were no parking restriction signs in the road where his car was towed , that he had considered putting a sign in front of his drive asking people not to park there but adds ' that would be insane '			0
not ' just a little bit ' overparked : as part of his response , @entity23 even posted a picture of a blue @entity42 parked across his driveway in response to @entity17 's suggestion that the owner of the driver put his ' fat a * * ' car ' on a diet so that he could 've squeezed his car out - @entity23 points out that his car is a @entity86 , which ' at 70.3 inches wide is one of the slimmest cars out there '			1
@entity17 also remarked in his videos that whoever towed his car away is a ' slut '			0
but @entity23 responds : ' that 's just not true man , i was n't trying to move my car so i could meet up with some sexual rendezvous , i just wanted to move my car because that 's my right			0
' and finally , @entity23 warns @entity17 not to leave his @entity98 on the passenger seat of his car , joking about how much he earned from @entity15 in 2012 and how much he owes the taxman			1
annoyed : @entity17 , pictured in one of his videos , is seen complaining that there were no parking restriction signs on the @entity44 road he ends his video with the warning : ' next time you park in front of a driveway , you might want to apologise to them in your @entity15 video because it 's probably 100 per cent your fault			1
' despite @entity23 's claims that he had the car towed away , it 's fair to say that there 's every chance that the video is tongue - in - cheek			1
but even if the video is just a joke , that did n't stop some of @entity17 's more outspoken followers hitting back at @entity23			1
one @entity15 user commented : ' this annoying p * * * * has been waiting for an opportunity like this to grab views / subscribers			0
' @entity133 car was the best ï»¿ thing that happened to him - just look at the glee on his face ! he 's not worried about any of the points he 's making ; it 's all look at me ! look at me ! '			0

@entity17 vented to his @entity15 fans that his @entity142 was towed away
he claimed that he was only partially blocking someone 's driveway
but comedian @entity23 has posted a response to @entity17 's rants
it is a tongue in cheek *reminder* to @entity17 to park more considerately
