if your lavender bushes seem to be bereft of bees , then you might need to be a little more selective in your choice of plant			1
for a study has found that @entity7 lavender is twice as good at attracting bumblebees as @entity10 lavender			1
its simple clusters of flowers are more accessible to bees than the ornamental frills on the @entity10 , according to scientists from the @entity17			1
a study has found that @entity7 lavender , pictured , is twice as good at attracting bumblebees as @entity10 lavender in the @entity23 survey carried out by 30,000 schoolchildren , the insects were spotted twice every five minutes on @entity7 lavender , where they feed on nectar			1
@entity10 lavender – characterised by frilly ‘ rabbit ear ’ petals that point upwards – saw bumblebees visit only once every five minutes			1
the study – one of a growing number of ‘ citizen science ’ experiments used to track wildlife – also found a surprising number of bumblebees in city centres , until now were thought to be desolate areas for pollinating insects			1
in fact , the participants recorded more bees on lavender in urban areas than in suburban or rural locations			2
the ecologists , presenting their results yesterday ( @entity50 ) at the @entity51 in @entity52 , said lavender creates an ‘ oasis ’ of nectar for bumblebees			2
dr @entity57 , of the @entity17 in @entity58 , @entity59 , said : ‘ what is commonly called @entity10 lavender tends to be a much more ornamental plant			2
‘ @entity62 tended to be visited at a much higher rate			0
‘ the names used do not mean that one is from @entity7 and the other is from @entity10 – they are both plants that were introduced to @entity68 in the past			1
’ @entity10 lavender , pictured here on a river bank , is characterised by frilly ‘ rabbit ear ’ petals that point upwards @entity7 lavender , which is more commonly planted in this country , copes better with cold and wet weather than @entity10 lavender , which is widely grown on the continent for its oil			1
dr @entity80 , also of the @entity17 , added : ‘ our understanding is that on more fancy flowers it is more tricky for the bumblebees to access the nectar			0
’ the scientists said they had been puzzled when participants had recorded more bees in city centre locations than in other areas			0
but they said the trend might be explained by the fact insects in urban areas are simply more reliant on lavender – the only species of plant that was monitored			0
dr @entity57 said : ‘ we were surprised to see more observations in urban localities , as suburban gardens are often thought to be better			0
‘ planting lavender - and other flowers - in city areas could help to support populations of pollinators in those habitats			2
’ @entity7 lavender , which is more commonly planted in this country , copes better with cold and wet weather than @entity10 lavender a quarter of the bumblebees in @entity112 are at risk of extinction as their habitats are destroyed , according to the @entity117			1
loss of wildflower meadows and the use of pesticides such as neonicotinoids are largely blamed for their decline			0
bumblebees are vital to agriculture as they pollinate fruit and vegetables - a natural phenomenon thought to be worth £ 560million a year to the @entity68 economy			0
the survey involved 30,000 children , who recorded 27,000 individual bumblebees at 4,000 sites			0
dr @entity135 said : ‘ the number of people who have taken part in the @entity23 is inspiring and their observations are extremely insightful			0
‘ understanding the experiences of citizen scientists is extremely useful for the development of future projects where mass participation can aid the scientific process			0

@entity7 lavender is twice as good as attracting bees than @entity10 *variety*
its simple clusters of flowers are more accessible than @entity10 frills
came from a survey which *revealed* insects were spotted twice every five minutes on @entity7 lavender
the study also found a surprising number of bumblebees in city centres
