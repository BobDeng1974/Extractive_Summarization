by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:13 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 04:26 est , 14 march 2013 a couple who found their son after he was abandoned as a baby in a @entity7 subway station have described the chance encounter that brought the family together as their ' destiny '			1
@entity12 was returning home to his partner @entity14 in august 2000 when he saw what he thought was a doll lying in the corner of the 14th @entity19 subway station in @entity20			1
when he glanced back , he saw the little legs wriggling and realized it was a baby boy wrapped in a sweatshirt			2
' mr @entity14 rushed to the scene where authorities had already taken charge of the day - old child who had his umbilical cord still attached			1
for several months there was wall - to - wall media coverage as authorities searched for the mother of the boy , who had been named baby @entity51			2
when after four months no one had come forward to claim the child , mr @entity12 was asked to appear in court to testify as to how he found the child			1
at the december proceedings , the judge suddenly asked if the couple would be interested in adopting the little boy			2
thirteen years later , reflecting on that fateful moment , mr @entity12 told @entity59 : ' i thought , '' maybe this is destiny , maybe this is divine intervention			0
this is a gift we 're given and how can we say no to a gift ? '' ' happy family : the couple and their son @entity69 who has now grown into a ' great kid ' , the fathers say adorable : mr @entity12 rides the @entity7 subway with his son @entity69 months after he found the boy abandoned near the turnstiles in a @entity77 station when they were first allowed to hold the baby , the couple knew they could hardly bear to be apart from him again			1
the pair were unexpectedly given custody of the boy with just 36 hours ' notice , and started their life together that @entity88			0
the judge later offered the couple the opportunity to adopt the little boy - at a time when it was difficult for gay partners to do so and more than a decade before same - sex marriage became legal in @entity7			1
their new son was re-named @entity69			0
the couple have kept their son 's identity a secret to protect him but said his presence in their lives made them ' better people '			0
and 12 years later , they were reunited with the judge who brought their family together when she presided at their wedding			2
life - changing : the couple said that the chance discovery of the baby boy was the best thing that has ever happened to them the family had no contact with the judge who had brought them together until 2011 , when they decided to wed after gay marriage was legalised in @entity7			1
@entity69 suggested that they should ask the same judge to officiate their wedding , so they contacted her through the court service and she said that she would be delighted to meet them again			0
when they walked in to the court room , @entity69 held out his hand to greet the woman who had given him his parents - but she insisted on hugging him instead			0
mr @entity14 wrote in the @entity135 that they were all enjoying their catch - up so much they almost forgot to conduct the actual wedding ceremony			0
the playwright has now turned his family 's experiences into a film , entitled @entity142 .			0
