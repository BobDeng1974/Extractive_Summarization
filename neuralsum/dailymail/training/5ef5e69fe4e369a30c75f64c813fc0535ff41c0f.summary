by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 11:31 est , 11 october 2012 @entity1 owns a today show t - shirt and a mug			2
when the stay - at - home mom and her family visited @entity7 from their home in @entity10 , @entity11 , they joined the crowd of fans outside the @entity17 morning show 's @entity15 studio			1
now , after more than 20 years as a regular today viewer , @entity1 tunes to @entity20 most mornings			2
multiply such defections and you have the chief reason for television 's changing fortunes in morning news , where @entity28 's @entity27 has ended @entity17 's epic 17 - year winning streak on today			1
@entity28 is growing — @entity27 has 110,000 more viewers each day this year than last — but not as much as @entity17 is slipping , 437,000 viewers a day since last year			1
used to winning : the @entity32 had been the morning show with the most viewers for the past 17 years before april of this year when @entity27 ruined their winning streak the new dream team : @entity28 's @entity27 are getting thousands more viewers than today since @entity38 was sacked @entity1 , 57 , left last spring because of today co-host @entity38			1
' @entity38 's interview style was like chalk on a board to me , ' she said			1
' she leaned toward her interviewee and whispered her questions like someone had died			2
' the more serious the interview , the quieter she got			2
when she replaced @entity47 , i tried to adjust and accept , but she just did n't work for me			2
@entity48 and @entity47 were relatable , empathetic and funny			0
@entity38 just seemed out of place			1
' executives at @entity17 were quietly reaching the same conclusion and moved to replace @entity38 with @entity52			1
then came june 28 , 2012 , @entity38 's last day as co-host			1
she cried in bewilderment at her perceived failure at losing the job she had sought for years , as her uncomfortable co-workers and a nation looked on			0
suddenly , a problem for @entity17 became a @entity61 problem			1
even people who did n't particularly like @entity38 loathed the way she was dispatched			1
except for two weeks during the @entity64 , today has n't sniffed first place in the ratings since			0
struggling : @entity38 cried in bewilderment at her perceived failure at losing the job she had sought for years , as her uncomfortable co-workers and a nation looked on during the first six months of 2012 , @entity32 averaged just under 5.2 million viewers each weekday			1
since july 2 , the audience has dropped to 4.59 million , according to @entity72 , the company that measures tv audiences			0
without the two weeks of the @entity64 , the average is 4.3 million			0
that 's a stunning drop , even accounting for typical lower viewership in the summer			0
an informal survey of three dozen viewers who have left or are considering leaving today turned up various explanations , including a feeling that the show had leaned too far in the direction of lighter , pop culture fare			1
the @entity38 dismissal was clearly a tipping point , however			1
@entity86 , a manager at an educational cable network who lives in suburban @entity89 , @entity90 , likened the treatment of @entity38 to ' a public flogging '			1
' the pr machine at @entity17 spent an enormous amount of time and effort convincing me that the today show team was actually part of my family , " @entity102 's @entity101 " , said @entity86 , 46 , citing the show 's advertising slogan			1
in charge : today executive producer @entity106 , center , is pictured with @entity47 , @entity38 , @entity108 , and @entity109 earlier this year admitting fault : @entity108 spoke on @entity112 's @entity111 saying that he did n't want to leave because he believes there is still work to be done to make the show stronger ' guess what ? they were right			1
these did feel like family members			0
so this is how you are going to treat a member of your family ? ' you can debate for hours whether ms @entity38 was right for the role , ' he said			1
' that 's not the point			0
she was doing her job and was barely 11 months into it when they canned her in the most humiliating way possible			0
' the move was ' heart - wrenching ' , said @entity133 , a 40 - year - old manager at a drug company from @entity135			2
' it made me feel sick for her			0
and it made me turn the channel , probably permanently			0
' ' while i thought @entity38 's interviews were a little hokey at times , she is clearly the most genuine person in tv news , ' said @entity145 , 53 , a graduate student and mother of three from @entity147 , @entity148			1
' after her unceremonious dumping , i turned it off			0
i have nothing against @entity152 , and adore @entity153 , but there is just a different tone to the show			0
' even worse for @entity17 , a significant number of viewers appear to blame co-host @entity108 for the move			1
the network has consistently denied tabloid reports that @entity108 was unhappy with @entity38			1
today executive producer @entity106 said late last month that @entity108 was being treated unfairly			1
@entity162 was @entity106 's decision , he said			0
some awkward public moments have n't helped			2
worrying : @entity28 is growing — @entity27 has 110,000 more viewers each day this year than last — but not as much as @entity17 is slipping , 437,000 viewers a day since last year the moment @entity108 lost his likability ? @entity38 's unceremonious booting off the show has long been a thorn in @entity108 's side , after it was claimed he was responsible for getting her axed when @entity38 reappeared on today during the @entity64 to introduce a story she had done , @entity108 twice remarked that it was good to see her again			1
@entity38 did n't return the sentiment to the man she worked with for 15 years			1
two years ago , @entity108 's positive ' @entity177 ' score was 23 — meaning 23 per cent of people who knew him considered @entity108 one of their favorite broadcasters , according to @entity183 , a company that measures public sentiment toward well - known personalities			1
meet the new host : it has been reported that @entity188 will join the today show to to serve as co-host during the 9am hour now his positive score is 14			0
at the same time , @entity27 co-host @entity193 ' positive ' q ' score jumped from 20 to 27			1
@entity133 felt there was a perception that @entity108 was ' king ' and others on the show are n't equal to him			2
@entity198 , 40 , a salesman from @entity199 , @entity200 , said @entity108 was ' not someone i 'd like to have a beer with '			2
' there is something about @entity108 , whether or not he was the reason for @entity38 's firing , that has changed and i do not like watching the show anymore , ' said @entity208 , a 20 - year - old aspiring journalist from @entity209 , @entity7			1
fortunately for @entity17 , viewers do n't seem to be taking out their unhappiness on @entity52			1
producers often say that viewing decisions for morning television can be intensely personal , since people are essentially inviting these personalities into their homes at an intimate time of day when they were getting ready for work			2
feeling a part of the tv ' family ' they see on air is part of it , and sometimes the reasoning seems strange			0
@entity198 said , for example , that he did n't like the couch on today because it looked uncomfortable			0
' in today 's doom and gloom news programs , the today show gave me a lift to get my day started , ' said @entity235 , 48 , from @entity236 , @entity237			2
' i do n't get that lift anymore , and i am in mourning over the fact			0
i have n't found anything i like better to take its place			0
' at least one - third of people who responded to a @entity245 request to discuss the show cited its content for their discontent			0
' i used to be a regular today show viewer but got tired of their formula , ' said @entity252 , 35 , a sports marketer from @entity254 ' five minutes of hard news followed by an animal rescue story , the @entity255 and then pop culture or fashion			2
it 's ok with me — in moderation			0
' @entity262 is a 64 - year - old retired nurse from @entity263 , @entity264 , who watched today for 40 years			2
now she says : ' i do n't care what @entity266 does			0
' ' i was fed up with the lack of actual news reporting , and more intense focus on silly , irrelevant things like women 's fashion or the newest celebrity 's recipe for a dinner i could never find the time or money to cook , ' said @entity279 , a 23 - year - old college student in @entity152 , @entity280			2
biting as they may be , at least those complaints offer today the seeds of potential recovery			0
leading ladies : @entity48 ( left ) and @entity47 ( right ) were @entity108 's female foils for many seasons and are said to be deeply missed by viewers @entity27 , particularly in its second hour , has an even greater pop culture emphasis			1
@entity106 said his show will try to draw a greater contrast with its @entity28 rival in coming months			0
a recent ad with @entity108 touts the ' informative ' nature of the show			2
@entity38 , who has kept her job with @entity17 as a hard news reporter , appeared on today during the past month interviewing @entity299 president @entity298 and reporting from @entity300			1
@entity20 has already tried to position itself as a newsier alternative in the morning			0
because today has a richer history and often twice as many viewers , it would be in better position to reach people who want this			2
@entity17 announced this week that @entity188 , an engaging and popular member of @entity310 's @entity309 team , will join today as a co-host of the 9am hour and occasionally appear earlier			1
' what i loved about the show were the hosts , reporters and the stories , ' said @entity318 , a marketer from @entity320 , @entity7 , who has watched today for more than 20 years			0
' it was always delivered in a friendly , engaging and informative manner			0
some of that has changed in that i miss the chemistry that was displayed with the prior hosts ... and some of the stories today was known for			0
' it has evolved into forgettable reports without giving me the important news and educational stories			0
' still , @entity318 is a loyalist			0
' i will continue to watch the today show and wake up to it every weekday , ' she said			0
@entity17 needs devoted fans like @entity318 to turn things around			1
it will take some time .			0

@entity27 has 110,000 more viewers each day this year than last
@entity17 have 437,000 viewers less than last year
public *ousting* of @entity38 , too much popular culture and @entity108 all reasons given by fans for turning over
