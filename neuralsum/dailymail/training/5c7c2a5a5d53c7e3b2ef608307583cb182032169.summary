by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 7 june 2013 bosses at the @entity2 were told three years ago that a doomed it project – axed only after wasting £ 100million - was heading for trouble			1
it emerged yesterday that a whistle - blower warned managers in 2010 that the supposed £ 95.4million ‘ benefit ’ from the project was ‘ hugely overoptimistic and difficult to deliver ’			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) was meant to allow @entity2 staff to access everything in the archive from their computers doing away with the need for video or audio tapes			1
scrapped : @entity18 , the new director general , finally abandoned the @entity10 which intended to do away with the need for video or audio tapes but the corporation announced that they were dropping the failed technology project nearly two weeks ago after frittering away almost £ 100 million of licence - fee payers money			1
reports have also suggested it had delivered no savings at all to the corporation			0
the @entity2 ’s chief finance officer @entity27 and a member of the @entity30 @entity29 are to face the @entity31 on monday , where they are expected to be grilled about the debacle			2
earlier this week it was revealed that @entity2 chairman @entity35 was warned a year ago about problems by former senior @entity2 manager , @entity37 , who was head of technology in the corporation ’s programme - making department until 2010			1
he wrote to @entity35 in may last year to warn him about ‘ serious concerns ’ over the cost of the @entity10 and that there was a risk that the @entity45 – the government ’s spending watchdog - may have been misled about the project			1
but further details of mr @entity37 ’s correspondence with @entity35 reveal he raised his concerns about the project to @entity2 management back in 2010			1
warning : @entity35 , the @entity2 chairman , was told of ' serious concerns ' over the cost of the project in particular he questioned the financial projections the @entity2 was making to back the continuation of the project , after the corporation took over running of it after previous deal with technology company @entity64 was brought to an end in 2009			1
when mr @entity37 looked at the figures , he told @entity35 in his letter , it had been ‘ professionally difficult for me not to question the value proposition of the revised investment case			0
‘ i believed the stated benefits to be hugely overoptimistic and difficult to deliver , accordingly i made my concerns clear to @entity2 management			2
’ @entity35 is said to have passed the concerns on to a colleague at the corporation ’s governing body , who had responded by saying there were ‘ no plans to carry out a further review ’ of the project			0
however trustee mr @entity29 did write to @entity31 chair @entity82 last year to tell her he was ‘ not content ’ with progress on the project			0
there is growing concern that elements at the broadcaster had failed to make clear the scale of the trouble the project was in			0
complaint : a trustee wrote to the @entity31 chair @entity82 about trouble with the @entity10 the @entity30 is thought to be very interested in discovering why it was not told by executives earlier about the problems			2
the governing body was said to have been ‘ shocked ’ when it learned about the scale of the disaster , following a report last month			0
hearing that mr @entity37 had raised the matter with bosses back in 2010 will no doubt be of interest to them			0
@entity106 have accused @entity35 of ‘ lurching from one crisis to another ’ and being ‘ asleep at the wheel ’			0
politicians branded the wasted money an ‘ outrage ’ when the corporation announced its closure about two weeks ago			2
it ’s chief technology officer , @entity115 , has been suspended as a review is conducted into what went wrong			0
at the end of last month new director general @entity18 finally abandoned the technological overhaul			1
he had admitted that the initiative ‘ wasted a huge amount of licence - fee payers money			1
’ he said he had concerns about how the project had been run and a review had been ordered to find out what went wrong			0
@entity35 was said to have personally replied to mr @entity37 earlier this week , apparently after the trust was informed the former @entity2 man had let @entity106 know about his letters			2
the @entity2 chairman is thought to have told him that his concerns , along with others , had led the @entity30 to ‘ seek further information ’ from the corporation ’s management in the summer last year .			0

*whistleblower* says @entity2 *'s* costly it project failure raised three years ago
