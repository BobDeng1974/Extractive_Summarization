by @entity1 medical correspondent full of beans : increasing coffee intake could cut the risk of diabetes , a study has found drinking more coffee may further reduce the risk of diabetes , say researchers			1
increasing consumption by one and a half cups a day cuts the chances of developing type 2 diabetes by 11 per cent			0
although previous research suggested coffee drinkers benefit from a reduced risk of diabetes , it now appears an individual ’s risk can be further improved by stepping up consumption			1
dr @entity25 and dr @entity26 , from the @entity22 at @entity24 ’s @entity23 , looked at the link between changes in coffee consumption and diabetes risk			1
they used data from three @entity34 - based studies including the nurses ’ @entity36 with participants ranging from 25 to 75 years			2
detailed information on diet , lifestyle , medical conditions , and other chronic diseases was collected every two to four years for over 20 years			1
participants whose coffee intake fell by one or two cups a day had a 17 per cent higher risk for type 2 diabetes			1
changes in tea consumption were not associated with type 2 diabetes risk , but few people changed their drinking habits			2
those with highest consumption of three cups of coffee a day or more had the lowest diabetes risk			0
it was a third lower than for those drinking one cup or fewer a day			0
the research was published in @entity59 ( the journal of the @entity61 )			0
fancy a cuppa ? those with highest consumption of three cups a day or more had the lowest diabetes risk the authors said the higher risk of type 2 diabetes from decreasing coffee intake may be a true change in risk , or may reflect people giving it up because they develop medical conditions such as high blood pressure , heart disease or cancer			1
however , even when cases of cardiovascular disease or cancer were excluded , the results were very similar			0
one researcher said there was ' novel evidence that changes in habits are related to diabetes risk ' although there was a lower risk of diabetes among decaffeinated coffee drinkers , increasing or decreasing consumption made no difference to the risk			0
dr @entity25 said : ‘ changes in consumption habits appear to affect diabetes risk in a relatively short amount of time			1
our findings … provide novel evidence that changes in habits are related to diabetes risk			0
’ studies on decaffeinated coffee have made similar findings with the protective effect due to ‘ direct biological effects ’ such as antioxidants and magnesium			0
because of the benefits from decaffeinated coffee , it is unlikely caffeine is solely responsible for the effect			0
a @entity115 investigation into the effects of diet and lifestyle on health last year found moderate coffee drinking lowered the risk of diabetes by around 30 per cent			1
dr @entity127 , @entity128 at @entity129 , said ‘ while this study found evidence of a connection between how much coffee you drink and your risk of type 2 diabetes , this does not mean that increasing your coffee intake will reduce your diabetes risk			1
‘ even if people who drank more coffee did tend to have a lower risk of @entity142 , it does not necessarily follow that coffee consumption was directly responsible			2
‘ other factors that this study has not identified could also be involved and it is even possible that being at high risk of type 2 diabetes encourages people to reduce their coffee intake			2
‘ what we do know is that the best way to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes is to maintain a healthy weight by eating a healthy , balanced diet and by being regularly physically active			0

researchers from @entity24 used data from more than 20 years
they also found people who reduced their coffee drinking had a higher risk
dr @entity25 said benefits can be *achieved* in a relatively short time period
