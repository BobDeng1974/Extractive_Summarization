by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 10:47 est , 15 november 2012 @entity1 , who works as a tailor in the fashion industry , was struck on the left leg by a @entity6 patrol car on the night of april 12			1
the impact sent @entity1 flying into the side - view mirror , then onto the ground , where he landed on his wrist			0
he was n’t badly hurt , but after brief treatment at @entity12 , faced medical expenses of $ 1,200			2
insult and injury : @entity1 was hospitalized by a police car and then expected to pay for it his family paid up but then pursued legal claims against the city to reclaim the money			1
as reported in the @entity22 , @entity1 maintains that he had a green light for the crosswalk on @entity25 and @entity26 in @entity27 when he was hit by the police car			2
he states that he had drank two beers that evening and uses a hearing aid after a childhood illness , but neither of these factors had any part to play in the incident			0
‘ i was perfectly coherent			0
i was shocked , certainly , but not inebriated , ’ @entity1 said			0
but the @entity6 also claim that their vehicle had the right of way			1
and , shortly after the @entity1 family began proceedings , @entity1 received a nasty surprise in the mail			2
a letter from a legal firm hired by the police department claimed $ 1,028.08 for damages to the patrol car			1
the missive also threatened that failure to address the matter would result in the filing of a lawsuit			0
a different @entity6 vehicle safely the navigates the intersection where @entity1 was injured in april the @entity1 family are convinced that this letter was in response to their own legal challenge			1
after the story was highlighted by the @entity22 , @entity59 police have admitted that the bill was sent in error			2
deputy commissioner @entity63 stated : ‘ the letter should not have been sent			0
we ’re examining safeguards to make sure similar letters are not sent in the future			0
’ an @entity6 patrol car similar to the one that knocked down @entity1 yet this is not the first time the @entity6 have added insult to ( sometimes fatal ) injury in 2012 alone			1
in september , the same law firm sent a demand for $ 710 , to be paid within ten days , to a man who was killed in a police chase			1
as the @entity81 reported at the time , this bill was opened by a grieving mother , who was ‘ humiliated ’ that her son was sent a letter ‘ for the car that killed him ’ .			0

*victim* ’s family attempt to sue the police for medical costs but get a threatening letter in *return*
@entity6 acknowledge that the demand ' should not have been sent '
