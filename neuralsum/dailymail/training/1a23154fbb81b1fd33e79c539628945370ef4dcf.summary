by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 14:15 est , 15 august 2013 if you 're bored of pizza and not in the mood for curry , how about trying a restaurant specialising in dishes made of insects ? honey caterpillar canapes , consomme of grasshopper dumpling with locust jus , and burnt bee larvae are all on the menu at @entity14 , a pop - up restaurant which starts a three - night run in south @entity17 tonight			1
the ambitious menu is the brainchild of four graduates who describe themselves as ' iconoclasts of taste ' , and say they who want to make creepy - crawlies a regular part of the @entity28 diet			1
they plan firstly to get people to enjoy eating them , and then to open a permanent restaurant			2
their ultimate goal is to get insects onto our supermarket shelves within seven years			0
' with your interest and lots of cooking and farming , we believe insect dishes could be a regular sight in your local supermarket by 2020 , ' said miss @entity43			1
the students , who came up with the idea as part of their design , innovation and engineering course at @entity17 's @entity71 , hope their restaurant will ' gently challenge our cultural taboo ' about ingesting bugs			1
part of this involves telling people how good they are for us			2
mr @entity42 said : ' we think people should know that insects are n’t only more space and energy efficient than traditional livestock , but also high in protein and nutrients like omega - 3 while remaining low in fat and cholesterol			0
' they say the animals like to be packed closely together , and eat less food than , for example cattle or sheep , so raise fewer ethical farming dilemmas			2
packed full of protein , zinc , calcium and iron , edible insects are already eaten by millions of people worldwide insects are said to pose a smaller risk of passing infection on to humans compared with other mammals , and on a more pressing theme , food production will have to double to keep our rapidly - growing population fed over the next few decades			0
but the most important part in persuading people to eat bugs is to make what the students call insect cuisine appetising			1
thus one of the dishes on offer at @entity14 tonight is grasshopper and honey caterpillar medallion , in which honey caterpillars are blended and fried into a thin crepe that is rolled around fresh carrot , radish and cucumber sticks to create a canape not entirely dissimilar to a spring roll			1
watermelon with caterpillar risotto and ground - up cricket is another dish , while fans of @entity131 food might enjoy consomme of grasshopper dumpling , scorched tofu and locust jus			1
' people assume the strength of the taboo is going to be reflected in the taste of the food , but it 's not			0
' - @entity14 founder @entity42 mr @entity42 told @entity142 : ' people assume the strength of the taboo is going to be reflected in the taste of the food , but it 's not			2
' eat @entity14 is not the only restaurant offering insects in @entity17 today			1
pest control firm @entity148 is also launching a pop - up ' pestaurant ' in the @entity150 , offering dishes such as salt and vinegar crickets , chocolate - dipped ant and , slightly less frighteningly , sweet chilli pigeon burgers			0
the food will be free and diners can ask the pest - control experts on hand any questions they have on the matter			0
a spokesman for @entity148 saids : ' edible insects have recently been identified by a number of different bodies , including the @entity167 ’s @entity166 , as a potentially valuable source of food for the world ’s rapidly growing population			0
' many insects are rich in protein , zinc , calcium and iron whilst also being low in fat , and they have a high ‘ feed conversion rate ’ , meaning that they can be farmed using relatively little land , water and energy compared to livestock			0
' pigeons , meanwhile , despite being a nuisance for many , are a well - recognised delicacy and wood pigeon can be found on @entity188 - starred menus across the world			0
proponents of insect cuisine hope to follow the lead of sushi , once considered beyond the pale by @entity28 and now a staple of @entity197 office workers .			2

eat @entity14 restaurant opens in south @entity17 tonight for three nights
its founders want to make edible bugs a regular part of the @entity28 diet
