a chance find in a thrift store has awakened a whirlwind of emotions for one @entity5 veteran			1
@entity6 , 90 , was brought to tears recently when he read a long - lost love letter he sent his future - wife @entity9 70 years ago , when he was a strapping young soldier , fighting with @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12			1
the letter was discovered tucked inside an old record purchased at a thrift store by @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity18 , who worked to reunite the letter with @entity6 's family			1
on the left , a picture of @entity9 from the time , and on the right , a picture of her future - husband in his uniform the discovery took @entity6 completely by surprise , and he both cried and laughed as he read the flowery note to the girlfriend he met on furlough			1
' my darling , lovable , alluring , @entity9 , ' the letter reads			1
' i ran out of space , but i could have written a lot more adjectives describing you			0
you are so lovely , darling , that i often wonder how it is possible that you are mine			0
i 'm really the luckiest guy in the world , you know			0
and you are the reason , @entity9			1
even your name sounds lovely to me			0
' the letter dated 1945 was a preface to the @entity6 's 63 years of marriage , in which they raised three children			1
' when you 're apart for that reason , not knowing if and when you 'd ever see that person again , every chance you got to communicate was just wonderful , ' @entity6 told @entity76			1
however , it is also a painful reminder of mrs @entity80 's passing			2
@entity9 died in 2010 , and her husband currently lives in a care home for veterans			1
meant to be : @entity6 sent the letter to is then - girlfriend @entity9 who he met on furlough			1
when he returned from war , the two got married and stayed together for 63 happy years of marriage			1
@entity9 died in 2010 today : @entity6 now lives in an assisted - living home for veterans			1
he says the letter was difficult to read because it 's a reminder that @entity9 is no longer with him ' it 's difficult talking out loud about it to other people , ' @entity6 said			1
' but i loved her , and she loved me			0
that 's all i can tell you			2
it ’s a heartache not being with her all the time			0
' last month , @entity101 spoke out about the search to find the rightful owner of the loving letter			2
@entity101 purchased the album at a local thrift store and later found the letter back at home - though she ca n't remember exactly which album the letter was hidden away in			1
@entity101 contacted @entity112 affiliate @entity76 for help in finding the relatives of the subjects of the letter and together they located the deceased mother @entity9 and elderly father @entity118 's daughter @entity119 , 48			1
@entity119 held back tears as she read the touching letter from her father to her mother 70 years ago			1
she told @entity112 she never could have imagined her father , a mechanical engineer , would use the flowery and loving language that he did			0
' it 's just when i get so horribly , terribly lonely for you that i write letters like this , ' the letter continues			2
' i have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as i am for you			0
' ' my hands were shaking when i finished reading it , ' @entity119 said emotionally			0
' it ’s truly was a window into how deep their love was			0
and obviously , they were married for almost 63 years			2
we knew they loved each other very , very much , but as children you do n’t see that			0
where it came from , that deep connection , and this was a window into their story			0
he was a mechanical engineer			0
i can not believe he shared these deep emotional words with her , ' she shared			0
@entity119 and her history teacher sister always had a fascination with their father 's experience in the war and in 2000 took a trip to @entity12 to retrace his steps			1
@entity167 loves : @entity118 and @entity80 raised three children , now all grown ' @entity169 had never gotten to see everywhere he had been			0
we did this amazing trip so i can picture exactly where he was on december 29 of 1944 , sitting in this miserable , cold , dark forest in the northern region where @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 all meet			0
' @entity119 told @entity112 she thinks her mother may have slipped the letter into the record for safe keeping because it was special to her			2
even though @entity101 says she ca n't remember which record she found the letter in , @entity119 has her own theory			2
@entity119 explained that her mother and father 's special song was ' i 'll be seeing you , ' from the @entity193 musical @entity194			2
@entity169 ’s song for dad was ‘ i ’ll be seeing you , ' she said			0
' i ’m sure it was in there			0
' ' what a sweet , wonderful @entity202 gift to give our family , ' @entity119 said			0
' i did n’t get to meet this wonderful lady who found the letter , but i just ca n’t thank her enough			2
' @entity207 plans to give the letter to her father who lives in a veteran 's assisted care facility .			1
