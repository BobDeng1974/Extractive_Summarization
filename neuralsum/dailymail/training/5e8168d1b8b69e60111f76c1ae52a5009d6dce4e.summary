vibrio bacteria can cause gastroenteritis and cholera in humans normally found growing in warm and tropical waters , the bacteria now thrives in the @entity7 as a result of rising temperatures caused by climate change , scientists say a temperature rise of one degree resulted in a 200 per cent increase in the number of @entity16 cases chances of getting a @entity16 infection still ' relatively low ' , say experts by @entity20 published : 04:31 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 04:32 est , 23 july 2012 thriving : vibrio bacteria strains will continue to appear in new areas as ocean temperatures rise , experts say the unexpected outbreak of a group of bacteria in northern @entity28 that can cause infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis is largely down to man - made climate change , new research shows			1
a study by a group of international experts has provided some of the first firm evidence that the warming patterns of the @entity7 have coincided with the emergence of @entity16 infections in northern @entity28			2
@entity16 - a group of bacteria that is normally found growing in warm and tropical marine environments - can cause an array of infections in humans ranging from cholera to gastroenteritis - like symptoms from eating raw or undercooked shellfish , or from exposure to seawater			1
symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhoea , vomiting , nausea and stomach cramps			0
a team of scientists from @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and the @entity61 found the number and distribution of @entity16 cases in the @entity7 sea area was strongly linked to peaks in sea surface temperatures			1
each year the temperature rose one degree , the number of @entity16 cases rose almost 200 per cent			1
' the big apparent increases that we 've seen during heat wave years ... tend to indicate that climate change is indeed driving infections , ' @entity71 from the @entity58 - based @entity72 told @entity78			2
the team of scientists examined sea surface temperature records and satellite data , as well as statistics on @entity16 cases in the @entity7			1
climate studies show that rising greenhouse gas emissions made global average surface temperatures increase by about 0.17 degrees @entity87 per decade from 1980 to 2010			0
the scientists focused on the @entity7 in particular because it warmed at an unprecedented rate of 0.063 to 0.078 degrees celsius a year from 1982 to 2010 , or 6.3 to 7.8 degrees a century			0
' ( it ) represents , to our knowledge , the fastest warming marine ecosystem examined so far anywhere on earth , ' said the paper , which was published in the journal @entity97 on sunday			0
many marine bacteria thrive in warm , low - saline sea water			0
climate change has also resulted in more frequent and heavier rainfall , which has reduced the salt content of estuaries and coastal wetlands			2
as ocean temperatures continue to rise and coastal regions in northern areas become less saline , @entity16 bacteria strains will appear in new areas , the scientists said			1
rising temperatures : the @entity7 represents the ' fastest warming marine eco-system examined so far anywhere on earth ' vibrio outbreaks have also been recorded in temperate and cold regions in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , the northwest @entity61 @entity120 and northwest @entity60 , and these can be linked to warming patterns , according to the research team			1
' very few studies have looked at the risk of these infections at high latitudes , ' mr @entity71 said			0
' certainly the chances of getting a @entity16 infection are considered to be relatively low , and more research is focused on areas where these diseases are endemic or at least more common , ' he added			1
previous @entity16 outbreaks in colder regions have often been put down to a sporadic event or special conditions rather than a response to long - term climate change			2
this is because the effects of global warming can be more pronounced at higher latitudes and in areas which lack detailed historical climate data , the study said			0
the scientist said there was a growing awareness that climate and the emergence of some infectious diseases are closely linked , but added that there are ' huge data gaps in that area which need addressing ' .			0

vibrio bacteria can cause gastroenteritis and cholera in humans
normally found growing in warm and tropical waters , the bacteria now thrives in the @entity7 as a result of rising temperatures caused by climate change , scientists say
a temperature rise of one degree resulted in a 200 per cent increase in the number of @entity16 cases
chances of getting a @entity16 infection still ' relatively low ' , say experts
