@entity0 has opened up about his battle with bowel cancer , saying he dismissed unusual symptoms because he was a ' typical man ' and dreaded the idea of going to a doctor about ' that part ' of his body			1
but six months after ignoring the tell - tale signs he was undergoing emergency surgery as well as having chemotherapy and radiotherapy for aggressive bowel cancer			1
‘ i was just a total bloke about the situation , ’ says @entity0 , 41 , who has recently become ambassador for @entity15 @entity14			2
@entity0 is pictured surrounded by nurses in march 2012 while undergoing chemotherapy for his bowel cancer at the @entity20 in @entity21 ‘ like most men i did n’t want to even think about going to a doctor and it was n’t until my then wife @entity25 nagged me that i eventually saw my gp			1
’ @entity0 , who has starred in @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , had been suffering with a small amount of blood in his stools and had noticed his bowel movements had changed			1
but he presumed that the blood was down to internal piles and his irregularity was due to the fact he had been travelling around @entity37			0
in january 2012 , @entity0 eventually listed the symptoms to his doctor , and he recommended @entity0 see a specialist as a matter of urgency			1
by chance @entity0 managed to get a last minute appointment with a private doctor within a few hours			2
the specialist advised a colonoscopy , to take a tissue sample from the bowel , and a ct scan			2
@entity0 felt well and never thought for a second that his minor symptoms could be the signs of something as deadly as bowel cancer a week later , @entity0 went for his tests at the @entity56			1
the scan immediately showed up a 6cm tumour in his bowel and he was diagnosed with cancer on the spot			1
‘ i could n’t quite compute what the doctor had told me , ’ remembers @entity62			0
‘ it was terrifying and cancer had always been something that happened to other people , not me			0
@entity0 had been scheduled to take time out from his role playing @entity70 in @entity72 ’s musical , 9 to 5 , and to fly to @entity73 for ‘ pilot season ’ - when actors promote themselves aiming for career success stateside			2
' i had no family history of the disease either , so it never occurred to me that symptoms i had mistaken for @entity81 and piles could be something so serious			1
' when @entity0 first opened up about his battle , he referred to wife of nine years , @entity25 , as his ' rock '			2
she had been having fertility treatment and they were desperate to start a family after losing babies due to a rare genetic bone and cartilage condition			0
bowel cancer affects 40,000 @entity14 and kills 16,000 each year			2
it usually starts in the large bowel but can rarely begin in the small bowel			0
symptoms usually include abdominal pain , blood in the stool , unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss			0
it is the third most common cancer in the @entity14 , but is the second most common in women			0
around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly			0
age , a low - fibre diet , being overweight , high alcohol intake , smoking and a family history of the disease puts you at an increased risk			1
the disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent			0

@entity0 had been due to visit @entity73 for work , but he was forced to cancel his plans to undergo emergency surgery			1
' surgeons were forced to remove almost half my bowel which was incredibly painful , ' says @entity0			1
' the whole combination of treatments was a shock to the system and to be honest i felt awful			0
' he also underwent a number of six - week cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
despite minor complications , he has made a full recovery and has been in remission for four months now			0
in january he announced that he had gone into remission , a year to the day of his diagnosis , tweeting : ' told today that its exactly 1 year tomorrow since i was diagnosed ... fingers crossed for happier results xx			1
' he now says he is feeling ' better than ever ' although he does admit he has become more vigilant about his health			0
‘ i have always eaten healthily but now i ’m extra careful			0
i do n’t eat red meat and wheat and i ’ve given up beer entirely – much as i miss it – because i just do n’t want to take the risk of the cancer returning			0
’ cancer battle : @entity0 , appearing in @entity28 has spoken about how he did n't get checked out @entity0 is now returning to the 9 to 5 tour and will be joining the rest of the cast in @entity203 in a matter of weeks			1
and he is keen to pass on the message of how important it is for men to monitor bowel health			0
' bowel cancer was always thought to be something that happened to old people and particularly those who have eaten a bad diet , but this simply is n't true			1
' if you get any of the symptoms of bowel cancer such as blood or abdominal discomfort , do n't self - diagnose of ignore it			1
getting it checked could save your life			0
