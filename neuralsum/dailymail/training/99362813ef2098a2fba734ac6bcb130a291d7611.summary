@entity7 ’s party took £ 386,605 from @entity8 ( @entity8 ) in the last quarter of 2014 , according to the @entity9			1
this is despite the fact the accountancy company was accused by a senior @entity0 mp of devising ‘ complex strategies and contrived structures ’ to help clients slash tax bills			1
@entity18 , the former @entity0 minister who is chairman of the commons public accounts committee , said it was ‘ inappropriate ’ for mr @entity7 to accept donations from the company			1
@entity7 's party was accused of hypocrisy after taking £ 386,605 from @entity8 ( @entity8 ) in the last quarter of 2014 her cross-party committee accused @entity8 of helping big firms avoid tax ‘ on an industrial scale ’ and ‘ artificially diverting profits ’ overseas			1
mr @entity7 ’s acceptance of donations from @entity8 sits uneasily alongside his claim in the @entity32 earlier this month that @entity0 donors accused of tax avoidance had not been allowed to give ‘ a penny on my watch ’			1
and it is the latest in a string of embarrassing blows to @entity0 ’s campaign against what mr @entity7 has branded the @entity42 ’ ‘ dodgy ’ donors			1
he has already faced questions about his family ’s use of a ‘ deed of variation ’ to minimise potential inheritance tax payments , while @entity51 ’s suggestion that he always asks tradesmen for a receipt was ridiculed by his window cleaner who said the @entity56 had not asked for one in 17 years			0

the company has paid for staff and research in the offices of several shadow ministers , including mr @entity51 and business spokesman @entity66			0

they are only too happy to publicly lambast companies but in private are happy to benefit from donations from them			0
‘ once again , @entity0 say one thing and do another – and it ’s hardworking taxpayers who would pay the price for the chaos of an @entity7 government			1
’ mrs @entity18 attacked her own party leadership earlier this month for ‘ inappropriate ’ links with @entity8			1
‘ the conservatives took money from @entity8 when they were in opposition , the @entity0 does and probably the @entity90 too			1
i think that ’s inappropriate – i would n’t do it , ’ she said			0
a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ given the complexity of government decisions in areas such as tax policy – and that opposition parties do not have significant access to civil servants – the support provided by organisations such as these helps ensure that there is better scrutiny of government policy			1
’ @entity8 said its staff provided ‘ limited and fully disclosed technical support to the main political parties ’			2
a spokesman added : ‘ we do not develop policy on their behalf			0
’ separately , @entity0 received almost £ 80,000 in support from another accountancy firm , @entity115 , which mrs @entity18 has previously accused of using ‘ insider knowledge ’ from @entity120 officials to help wealthy clients avoid tax			1
yesterday ’s @entity9 figures showed that despite the private donations , @entity0 remains heavily reliant on trade unions			2

in a rare non-stage - managed encounter with a member of the public , the @entity0 leader was told by an aircraft factory worker that voters wanted to have a say on whether @entity145 should continue its membership of the @entity137			2
in the awkward encounter , @entity129 , an electrician at @entity147 in @entity148 , told mr @entity7 : ‘ this morning we sat in the brew room over there , your workers , and they are all leaning now towards @entity125			2
‘ the question on everyone ’s mind is the referendum			0
i know what you are going to say but the working - class man in here wants to have a say			0
we have too many people here , that is why we have all got these people out of work			0
’ the @entity0 leader said that if he won office , he would make jobless @entity137 migrants wait two years before claiming benefits and stop firms undercutting the minimum wage , before shaking mr @entity129 ’s hand and saying ‘ very nice to meet you ’			2
mr @entity129 later told the @entity174 that he was referring to a chat between ‘ 20 - odd working - class blokes ’			0
he said : ‘ basically they are just not happy with @entity0 at the moment			2
the big thing with the working - class man is immigration and @entity181			0
’ mr @entity7 was on a visit to the @entity147 site in @entity184 and given a tour of its workshops , where the @entity189 and @entity190 aircraft are built			2
his encounter with mr @entity129 came as one of @entity0 ’s biggest donors warned that failing to offer the public an in - out referendum could lose the party the election			1
@entity198 , who has given £ 1.65 million to @entity0 , said mr @entity7 ’s refusal to let the public have a say would ‘ certainly ’ cost the party votes in key seats			1
the multi-millionaire owner of retail business @entity205 told a conference of @entity208 in @entity209 : ‘ i have heard rumours that there is a majority in the @entity213 who are in favour of having a referendum			0
i ’m sure one of the reasons for this is concern about whether refusing to have a referendum is going to lose @entity0 votes in what is going to be a very tight election			2
’ out of £ 58.5 million in donations received by @entity0 since mr @entity7 became the party ’s leader , £ 40.4 million ( 69 per cent ) has come from the trade union movement			1
@entity228 , the half - brother of @entity72 mp @entity229 , donated £ 55,000 to @entity125 , while @entity230 , the property developer son of @entity232 owner sir @entity231 , gave the party £ 80,000 , and @entity234 , the owner of the @entity236 and @entity237 newspapers , donated £ 300,000			0

almost £ 2 million of @entity72 donations in the last quarter of last year came from hedge fund donors – and three @entity72 donors were named last week as having previously held accounts at the @entity253 branch of @entity254			1
hedge funds have defended themselves against criticism from @entity7 , arguing that they contributed £ 4 billion in @entity145 taxes last year			2
but @entity258 , the shadow cabinet office minister , said : ‘ the @entity42 are now the political wing of the hedge fund industry			0
‘ the @entity72 election campaign is increasingly reliant on those who dine exclusively at the prime minister ’s top table and a select few from the world of finance			0
the @entity42 ’ plan is failing working families because their priority has been to help a few at the top			0
’ the biggest conservative donors were @entity273 , founder of travel company @entity274 , who gave £ 500,000 ; lord @entity276 , the former owner of @entity278 ( £ 334,000 ) ; and @entity279 , a property magnate ( £ 322,000 )			2

being a client of a @entity253 bank is not against the law , and does not prove tax avoidance or evasion			1
there is no suggestion that any of the individual donors did anything unlawful			0
