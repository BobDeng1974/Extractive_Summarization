@entity0 , pictured , wrote about the unnamed paedophile in his autobiography , claiming he abused children in the @entity5 toilets another @entity5 radio celebrity whose career spanned half a century is alleged to have molested young boys he invited into his studio at @entity12			1
it is claimed the abuse was hushed up by corporation bosses , who wrote to the parents of any boys who complained advising them not to take the allegations further			1
the name of the man , who was a children ’s radio star , is already circulating on @entity22 and other sites			1
it has been passed to police examining the torrent of allegations against the late @entity28			1
the man ’s alleged sex crimes were first raised in a book written by respected @entity32 editor @entity0 , 68 , more than ten years ago			1
he said he was told of them when compiling the man ’s obituary shortly after his death in 1967			1
@entity37 claimed he was told to keep them secret by his immediate boss			2
yesterday the @entity41 newspaper ran a report on the affair , giving the man the same pseudonym – ‘ @entity47 ’ – that @entity37 had used in his book			1
but last night thousands could see his name on @entity22 , after numerous users posted it having followed the obvious clues given by @entity37 to identify him			1
the man ’s daughters and grandchildren said yesterday that the claims were ‘ complete rubbish ’ , apparently made on scant secondhand evidence			1
none of the relatives had heard anything about the allegations until contacted by the @entity63 yesterday , even though they were first published in 1999			1
in it , the journalist wrote of his early years at the @entity5 , and of ‘ @entity47 ’s ’ death in 1967			2
he had worked at the corporation since the 1920s			2
@entity37 said he was asked to write the radio star ’s obituary , and as research rang a woman he named as ‘ @entity79 ’			1
this woman reportedly described ‘ @entity47 ’ as ‘ an evil old b * * * * * * ’ and added : ‘ i hope he died in agony			0
’ @entity37 wrote in his autobiography : ‘ week after week , children from all over the country would win competitions to visit the @entity5 and meet @entity47			1
he would welcome them , show them around , give them lunch , then take them to the gents and interfere with them			0
‘ if parents complained , the director general ’s office would write saying the nation would n’t understand such an accusation against a much - loved figure			0
’ a tv director reported @entity28 to @entity5 bosses decades ago - when he caught the star having sex with a 15 or 16 - year - old girl in his dressing room @entity37 went on to say that he told his editor of these allegations – but was hectored into writing a report praising him			1
according to his account , his boss called him a ‘ stupid , unthinking , ignorant , destructive young idiot ’ , before going on to dictate : ‘ @entity79 told the @entity5 tonight that she was deeply saddened by @entity47 ’s death			0
he had a wonderful way with children			1
’ @entity37 said the editor then told him : ‘ that ’s how you do an obit			0
’ @entity37 was yesterday abroad and not responding to messages			0
last night one of the man ’s daughters , who is 76 and lives near @entity124 , told the @entity63 : ‘ i ’m absolutely astounded by these claims			1
my father did nothing but good			0
he was disabled and did a lot for charity			0
he was a patron of one charity alongside the @entity131			0
‘ and he was a very busy man who did not have the opportunity to invite children to the @entity5 or to do these things			1
‘ as far as i understand @entity0 was on @entity5 television , not radio , so never met my father – and this is all hearsay			2
@entity0 should be for the high jump			0
how dare he say something like this			0
‘ and what a terribly hurtful thing for this “ @entity79 ” to say , “ i hope he died in agony ”			0
’ ‘ @entity47 ’s ’ other daughter , an 80 - year - old living in @entity146 , similarly denied there could be any truth to the claims			0
her daughter , a 51 - year - old lawyer , added : ‘ obviously we totally refute these allegations			2
‘ nothing like this has ever been raised in the entire lifetime of my mother or her sister			0
we have never even heard any rumours , let alone allegations			2
‘ we are very upset that nobody bothered to contact the family before these allegations were printed			2
’ the granddaughter said the family were considering legal action , but did not clarify on what grounds			0
in @entity170 law it is impossible to libel the dead			0
