the @entity3 prefers @entity4 , and those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer , a new study of @entity2 's drinking habits has revealed			1
researchers analysed a million tweets to make the finding one million geotagged tweets ( that is , tweets with associated locational data ) containing the keywords ' wine , ' ' beer , ' and a range of top selling or well established ' cheap ' brands of predominately light and pale lagers were included in the analysis			1

overall , residents of the eastern and western @entity16 coastal regions were more partial to wine ( or at least were more likely to tweet about it ) , while people from several @entity47 states and into @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 were more apt to tweet about beer			1

beer or wine ? the team also analysed what people prefer to drink , and say wine drinkers tend to live near the coast while the dominance of top - selling @entity4 and @entity18 in the “ light beer cyberspace ” of @entity82 is not surprising , geographic preference for @entity18 in the @entity16 showcased the overall preferences in certain regional and state markets , the team said			1
. this regional preference became more prevalent when examining the tweets of beers with smaller market shares , including @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and even @entity110			0
even preference for beer or wine was geographically evident when mapped			0
most wine - related tweets were sent from the wine - growing regions of @entity58 , @entity59 , and northern and central @entity60			2
overall , residents of the eastern and western @entity16 coastal regions were more partial to wine ( or at least were more likely to tweet about it ) , while people from several @entity47 states and into @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 were more apt to tweet about beer			1
the found smaller beers tended to be very localised in their popularity @entity122 said , ' beer , like many other social practices , may be millenniums old but the socio - spatial practices associated with it – checking into a brewery , posting a review , geotagging a photo – continue to evolve and therefore our approaches to data and research must also evolve to capture these geographies			2
' these insights into how @entity2 tweet about their favorite beers are featured in @entity76 edited by @entity139 and @entity140			0
