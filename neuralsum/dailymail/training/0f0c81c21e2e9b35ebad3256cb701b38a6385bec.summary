it should focus on providing affordable housing			0

' all of our available council properties are advertised online so anyone in need of a council home can apply			2
' in contrast to the case above , where the council has charged the couple a relatively modest @entity1 rental rate , there have been several instances in recent years where properties owned by private landlords have been used to house families on benefits - at a great cost to taxpayers ... a mother of eight told of her ‘ great ’ life in a £ 2.6million home funded by taxpayers			1
@entity133 receives more than £ 90,000 a year in benefits to pay the rent on the five - bed villa , plus other payouts			1

speaking in 2009 , @entity145 said : ‘ all my life i ’ve lived in overcrowded flats on estates with gangs that kicked our door in and harassed my children			0
‘ we lived in some hellholes			0
one stank so badly we could n’t use two rooms			0
another had a gas leak that made my children ill. ’ @entity145 , whose children range from five to 16 , was given the house because a new rule introduced by the government in april forces @entity176 and @entity177 council to fund suitable homes for large families			2
none of the available council houses was big enough , so the local authority pays for her to rent from a private landlord			1
miss @entity133 admitted the move had caused ‘ a lot of jealousy ’			0
a single mother with three children was placed by her local council in a £ 1.5million mews house four years ago			1

the seven - bedroom home in @entity211 , @entity1 , where an @entity207 family were placed at a cost of £ 2,875 a week to taxpayers @entity217 said a new housing cap will come into force next april more than 100 families on benefits are living in luxury homes more than 11,000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayers ’ £ 47,000 salary , it was revealed last month			1
the figure was disclosed by @entity230 @entity217 before letters were sent to households explaining a new cap on benefits under which no one can claim more than the average annual working wage of £ 26,000			2
the cap comes into force next april and aims to remove the disincentive to work that leaves many of the unemployed better off on benefits			0
according to official figures , at least 100 families on benefits are living in luxury homes , with many receiving housing handouts of about £ 5,000 per month – enough to fund a £ 1million mortgage			1
households exempt from the cap include those where there are people in work and claiming working tax credits , and families that are deemed to be very vulnerable – including war widows and those claiming disability living allowance			0
people who have lost their job but were employed for 12 months or more prior to claiming benefits will have nine months ’ grace before the cap applies			0
@entity259 , of the @entity98 ’ @entity98 , said : ‘ many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they ’ve ever actually earned themselves			0
‘ the welfare system needs to provide a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable in society , but these figures demonstrate that the current system has got out of control and that the government ’s proposed benefits cap needs to be introduced as a matter of urgency			2
’ the prime minister has also said it is ‘ time to call time ’ on excessive benefits			0
@entity146 said in january : ‘ it ’s a basic issue of fairness			0
should people really be able to earn more than £ 26,000 just through benefits alone ? ‘ i do n’t believe they should			2
and i think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view			0
’ ministers will overhaul the tax and benefits system from october next year , when a universal credit will be introduced to simplify the system and replace swathes of tax credits and benefits			0
they claim it will ensure that no one will be better off on benefits than in work , removing the so - called ‘ cliff edge ’ where those who take on part - time work end up worse off as benefits are removed			2
but critics have warned that families affected by the benefits cap could lose their homes , as around 44 per cent of those set to be hit are living in social housing			0
@entity308 , of the @entity309 , said : ‘ the letters will come as a shock to many vulnerable families			0
the overall benefit cap is a crude measure that fails to reflect the stark differences in housing costs across the country caused by the desperate shortage of affordable housing			0
’ he called on councils to share information they had on who could be affected so that housing associations could offer help			0
‘ with under a year to go before many people start losing their homes , there ’s no time to lose , ’ he added			0
mr @entity217 said : ‘ for more than ten years @entity328 let the benefits bill soar , and these figures show the scale of the problem			0
‘ it is absurd that people are able to claim as much on benefits as a higher rate taxpayer earns			0
‘ the welfare state should work as a safety net and then support people to financial independence			2
' our welfare reforms will make sure a life in work always pays more than a life on benefits , and are a clear illustration that this government is on the side of people who work hard , do the right thing and aspire to a better life			2
’ the 11,000 households exposed by mr @entity217 enjoy benefits of more than £ 34,000 a year , equating to a gross wage of £ 47,000			2
this is enough to put most employees into the higher rate 40p tax band .			0
