it weighs just half an ounce and its natural home is a tree			0
but tiny songbird the blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes non-stop flights of up to 1,700 miles across open ocean , scientists have confirmed			1
the heroic journeys are ' on the brink of impossibility ' , according to one of the researchers who attached tracking devices to 40 birds			2
long journey : the blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes flights of up to 1,700 miles , flying without stopping to rest , eat or drink across the @entity20 experts had long wondered about tantalising clues that suggested the warbler was capable of epic migrations between @entity25			1
now they have proof that it really does fly without stopping to rest , eat or drink across the @entity20			1
unlike other migratory songbirds travelling south for the winter , the warbler ignores the safe option of hugging the coastline through @entity33 and @entity34			0
instead it risks death by flying hundreds of miles from land even though it can not land on water and live			2
nice flight : a blackpoll warbler wearing a miniature tracking device @entity45 scientists were astonished when they analysed data from some of the birds they tracked from @entity49 and @entity50 to the @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
dr @entity54 , from the @entity55 at @entity56 , said : ' it was pretty thrilling to get the return birds back , because their migratory feat in itself is on the brink of impossibility			2
' when we accessed the locators , we saw the blackpolls ' journey was indeed directly over the @entity20			1
the distances travelled ranged from 1,410 to 1,721 miles			0
' he added : ' for small songbirds , we are only just now beginning to understand the migratory routes that connect temperate breeding grounds to tropical wintering areas			0
' we 're really excited to report that this is one of the longest non-stop over-water flights ever recorded for a songbird , and finally confirms what has long been believed to be one of the most extraordinary migratory feats on the planet			1
' for the study , published in the @entity81 journal @entity82 , the scientists captured 20 birds in @entity85 and another 20 in @entity86 and fitted them with geolocator packs			2
the devices , each about the size of a 5p piece , were attached using leg harnesses , much like a rucksack			0
too small to house gps receivers , they operated by means of ' solar geolocation ' - a method used for centuries by mariners and explorers			0
it is based on the fact that day length varies with latitude and the time of solar noon - when the sun is at its highest point in the sky - varies with longitude .			0
