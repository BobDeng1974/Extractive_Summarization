@entity3 , then @entity5 ’s foreign secretary , laying claim to the moral high ground , proclaiming : ‘ i abhor anything that constitutes torture			1
water - boarding , it ’s perfectly clear to me it is torture			0
‘ i never supported extraordinary rendition to torture , always said that @entity13 should be closed			0
there is no clash of ideals and pragmatism there			0
’ his uncompromising comments came in an interview in the @entity22 magazine in 2009			0
the truth is that those pious words turned out to be as hollow as his younger brother @entity40 ’s vow of family loyalty as he ruthlessly knifed @entity3 and stood for the leadership himself			2
for exactly one year after @entity3 ’s ‘ i abhor torture ’ interview , he was exposed as being behind a cover - up of one of the most shameful episodes in @entity5 ’s rule — @entity52 ’s secret involvement in the torture of terror suspects overseas			1
@entity3 had tried to use the court system over a period of six months to block publication of the fact that @entity28 had connived in the torture of one suspect , @entity30 , a former @entity52 resident who had been detained in @entity59 in 2002 on suspicion of having attended an @entity61 training camp			1
@entity30 , a former @entity52 resident , was detained in @entity59 in 2002 on suspicion of having attended an @entity61 training camp			1
court documents revealed he was ubjected to ' cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment by the @entity66 authorities ' , in which the @entity52 intelligence services had been complicit three times , @entity3 went to court to obtain @entity72 certificates ( which exclude official documents from public view ) to try to keep the truth secret about his torture in @entity77			1
in the process of concealing @entity28 ’s dirty secrets , the @entity78 ran up a taxpayer - funded legal bill of £ 213,000			0
in a landmark ruling in february 2010 , the @entity82 effectively accused @entity28 of complicity in torture and a culture of disregarding human rights			1
so what was the deeply compromised @entity3 trying to conceal ? the court documents said that @entity30 had been subjected to ‘ cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment by the @entity66 authorities ’ , in which the @entity52 intelligence services had been complicit			1
@entity3 's pious words on torture turned out to be as hollow as his younger brother @entity40 ’s vow of family loyalty as he ruthlessly knifed @entity97 and stood for the leadership himself the documents also said he was ‘ intentionally subjected to continuous sleep deprivation			1
the effects of the sleep deprivation were carefully observed ’			0
@entity30 was awarded £ 1 million compensation — a clear sign of the @entity106 ’s guilt			1
it must be said that mr @entity3 was only trying to cover up something that had occurred mostly in 2002 , under a previous @entity5 foreign secretary			2
but the court ’s findings had made public the brutal methods deployed by the @entity66 , with the full knowledge of @entity28 , which went against a commitment made by the then @entity52 government at the height of the @entity117 that banned torture techniques such as subjecting hooded prisoners to beatings , food and sleep deprivation , and exposure to very loud noise for prolonged periods			1
among arguments about torture heard by the court was that ‘ if it had been administered on behalf of the @entity52 , it would clearly have been a breach of the undertaking given by the @entity52 in 1972			1
’ following the @entity82 ruling , a shame - faced @entity3 had to go to the @entity132 and grovel , saying he had gone to court on a principle that was ' fundamental to national security ' following the @entity82 ruling , a shame - faced @entity3 had to go to the @entity132 and grovel , saying he had gone to court on a principle that was ‘ fundamental to national security ’			2
how ironic that the man who was prime minister at the time of this appalling treatment of a terror suspect was @entity143 , who had spoken of war as being a moral crusade			2
this is the same man whose first foreign secretary , @entity147 , had proclaimed the party ’s commitment to an ‘ ethical ’ foreign policy			0
this is the same man who converted to @entity154 and whose current job — among many other lucrative posts — is as a peace envoy			0
and what about his one - time @entity5 colleague , @entity3 ? what is clear is that he was egged on by @entity163 officials , who realised that the continuing stench over the @entity165 was damaging prime minister @entity167 ’s election prospects			2
@entity3 sent the @entity168 a stream of letters and emails , pleading with the @entity173 administration to back him and prevent the public release of the documents , whose contents could deeply damage the special relationship between the two countries on intelligence - gathering			2
indeed , so serious were @entity3 ’s concerns that he sent his top legal adviser , @entity181 , to @entity173			2
next , @entity3 raised the political temperature by attacking ‘ irresponsible judges ’ , claiming that if they authorised the release of the information , they would be giving ‘ succour to the country ’s enemies ’			0
even after losing his legal battle , he rejected the chance , during his ill - fated leadership campaign , to come clean			0
instead , he persisted in his denials about @entity5 ’s role in barbaric torture			0
asked in a @entity198 interview by @entity199 if he was aware that @entity28 had provided questions for the @entity201 to put to terrorist suspects who were being tortured , he replied : ‘ we do n’t have evidence of that			0
’ yet the truth is that , as foreign secretary , he submitted documents to the court which showed the reverse was true			2
they confirmed that @entity52 intelligence was involved in questioning terror suspects , including @entity30			1
surely , a politician with more moral scruples would have put public duty above all else and would have set up an inquiry into the allegations that at least 15 @entity52 nationals or residents claimed to have been tortured with the complicity , knowledge and sometimes even in the presence of @entity52 intelligence officers ? how ironic that the man who was prime minister at the time of this appalling treatment of a terror suspect was @entity143 , who had spoken of war as being a moral crusade			1
this is the same man whose first foreign secretary , @entity147 ( right ) , had proclaimed the party ’s commitment to an ' ethical ' foreign policy it is clear that @entity3 was egged on by @entity163 officials , who realised that the continuing stench over the @entity165 was damaging prime minister @entity167 ’s election prospects to this day , @entity3 ’s supporters insist that he was not fully aware of the details of the @entity66 ’ torture activities			1
but @entity245 mp @entity244 is scathing about their refusal to accept the truth , saying that it was irresponsible to suggest that the evidence was a threat to national security			0
‘ he is guilty of a cover - up , ’ he says			0
the irony is that @entity3 now runs an international human rights charity			1
as director of the @entity256 , he earns £ 300,000 a year			1
one reason he was given the job was because of his top - level political contacts as a former @entity52 foreign secretary			0
working from an office in @entity262 , @entity3 was recently praised by former @entity66 president @entity263 as ‘ one of the ablest , most creative public servants of our time ’			2
last month , he schmoozed with @entity268 , one of the world ’s most celebrated pop stars , and @entity272 actor sir @entity271 , another @entity5 luvvie , at a gala dinner at the @entity275 in @entity262			0
following the appalling revelations by the @entity279 committee , will @entity262 ’s smart set be so keen to be seen with @entity3 when they learn about his own shameful role in trying to cover it up ?			0

@entity3 tried to use courts to keep truth of suspect 's torture secret
@entity30 detained on suspicion of attending @entity61 camp
court documents said @entity30 subjected to ' cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment by the @entity66 authorities '
@entity52 intelligence services complicit in this , according to the documents
@entity30 was later awarded £ 1 million compensation
@entity3 's supporters insist he was not fully aware of @entity66 torture details
he now earns £ 300,000 a year running international human rights charity
