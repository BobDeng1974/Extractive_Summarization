if you are an aspiring manager in @entity2 football and you are black , you get used to one thing : when an opportunity comes your way , it ’s going to be the managerial equivalent of a hospital pass			2
sorry , but it ’s true			0
with a few exceptions , you do n’t get the better opportunities			0
you get the football version of mopping up the toilets			0
@entity13 , the only black manager in the @entity14 , is a classic example			1
@entity13 is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs			1
@entity13 ( right ) and @entity17 watch @entity20 hammer @entity18 to keep their survival hopes alive @entity13 takes nots during his side 's biggest win of the season which gave their survival chances a boost he took the @entity20 position after @entity29 , a talented , experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble , saw the writing on the wall and got out			1
@entity13 was asked to board the sinking ship and , guess what , it has not been an easy job to refloat it			1
before the victory at @entity18 , @entity20 were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on @entity13			1
just as predictably , there were also those saying @entity13 ’s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance			2
@entity52 ' troubled reign at @entity53 ended after an infamous @entity55 defeat by @entity56 if @entity13 is sacked , people will say it was about results , not race			2
and they will be wrong			0
because race was why he had to take the job in the first place			0
people tend not to like inconvenient truths about why there are so few black managers in the @entity2 game			0
some got angry again when @entity52 suggested a manager on a bad run will get sacked sooner if he ’s black			2
the fact @entity13 has been labouring to turn things around at @entity20 does not mean he is not a good manager			1
it just means that when your only chance in the game is to accept a hospital pass , the odds are you ’re going to get hurt .			0
