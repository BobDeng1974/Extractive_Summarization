@entity1 director @entity0 has ordered a sweeping overhaul of the spy agency , aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into traditional intelligence gathering @entity0 announced the restructuring to the @entity1 workforce friday			1
he said the move comes after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency 's management structure , including what deputy @entity1 director @entity16 called ' pain points , ' organizational areas where the @entity1 's bureaucracy does not work efficiently			1
briefing reporters with @entity16 at @entity1 headquarters this week , @entity0 said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the @entity1 is not covering			2
he lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world			0
not your grandparents ' @entity1 : the @entity1 is launching one of the biggest reorganizations in its history , aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into intelligence gathering critical look : @entity1 director @entity0 said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the @entity1 is not covering ' there are a lot of areas that i would like to have better insight to , better information about , better access to , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity50 , denied areas			0
whether because we do n't even have a diplomatic presence in a country , or because there are parts of countries that have been overrun and taken over by terrorist groups and others			0
' on the cyber front , the @entity1 chief said he is establishing a new ' @entity62 ' to lead the agency 's efforts to track and take advantage of advances in cyber technology			1
@entity69 officials said that @entity0 decided the agency had to increase the resources and emphasis it devoted to cyberspace because advanced communications technology is rapidly becoming pervasive			1
historically , electronic eavesdroppers at the @entity76 have been at the cutting edge of digital innovation within the @entity69 government			0
but the @entity1 felt that it too had to reorganize to keep up with the technological ' pace of change , ' as one official put it			2
@entity0 said the new digital directorate will have equal status within the agency with four other directorates which have existed for years			0
' our ability to carry out our responsibilities for human intelligence and national security responsibilities has become more challenging ' in today 's digital world , @entity0 said			0
' and so what we need to do as an agency is make sure we ’re able to understand all of the aspects of that digital environment			0
' @entity97 : evidence shows that the @entity1 may have taken too long to find and kill @entity99 - a mission that was accomplished in 2011 after a decade - long manhunt @entity0 avoided the term ' cyber , ' a word used by the @entity76 , the country 's premier digital spying service the changes come against a backdrop of widespread concern that the @entity1 's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the september 11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the @entity117			1
the @entity1 , along with other @entity69 intelligence agencies , wrongly assessed the presence of weapons of mass destruction in @entity121 in 2002 and failed to anticipate the rapid collapse of @entity124 governments during the @entity125 in 2011 , among other shortcomings			2
the agency 's greatest public success of recent years — the 10 - year effort to locate and kill @entity99 in 2011 — may have taken longer than it should have , according to evidence made public in the recent @entity132 report on @entity1 interrogations			1
@entity135 @entity1 surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency			1
in the most significant departure , the @entity1 would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms , a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses , in different offices , than analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers			1
the new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world			1
there are a handful of such centers at the moment , including the @entity168 , where analysts and operators have worked side by side for the last decade targeting @entity173 with espionage and drone strikes			2
under the new plan , each center would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction , including covert operations , spying , analysis , liaison with foreign partners and logistics			1
the system of @entity1 stations , headed by a @entity1 station chief , will remain in place , @entity0 said			2
most stations are in @entity69 embassies , and various @entity1 case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centers			1
the changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the @entity1 's current budget , @entity1 officials said			1
critics of a blended approach have raised concerns that combining analysts with operators could compromise the objectivity of the analysts , who are tasked with coldly interpreting intelligence in which they have no stake			2
it may be harder for an analyst to cast doubt on a source recruited by a case officer he knows personally , the theory goes			0
blended : the new overhaul plan would bring @entity1 operatives and data analysts together in 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world the head of the @entity1 's operation arm retired abruptly in january after voicing concerns about the plan , say two former @entity1 officials who know him but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss internal agency matters			1
@entity0 said the undercover officer 's decision ' was not a result of this , ' but he did not dispute that the officer had opposed some of the changes			0
' any time we 've put analysts and operators together , the result has been a more powerful product , ' said @entity243 , a former @entity1 analyst who became acting director , and who advised @entity0 on the restructuring			2
@entity0 is retaining the old structure of @entity1 ' directorates			0
' but he is changing some names , including restoring the old moniker ' @entity252 , ' to the spying arm , the name it had before being rebadged the @entity252 in 2005			1
for analysts , what used to be called the @entity257 will be renamed the @entity258			0
two others , the directorates of support and security , remain			0
the directorates will manage human resources and set tradecraft standards , @entity0 said , while the centers carry out the intelligence missions			0
the @entity1 will also significantly boost its leadership training and talent development efforts , which have been compared unfavorably to the military , @entity0 said			0
the reorganization is already drawing fire from some quarters			0
@entity274 , a former @entity1 analyst who famously dissented from the case for war in @entity121 , expressed concern that the costs of the changes would outweigh the benefits			2
' i worry that this plan may be another instance of the all - too - common pattern , among senior managers in both governmental and private sector organizations , to try to leave a personal mark by reorganizing the place , ' he said in an email .			0

@entity1 would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms
case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations will be blended with data analysts into 10 centers devoted to different areas
the agency 's spying arm , known since 2005 as @entity252 , will be renamed ' @entity252 '
a new ' @entity62 ' will be created to keep trakc of advances in cyber technology
