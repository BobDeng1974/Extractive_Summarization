by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 13:27 est , 8 october 2012 these touching photographs show a lioness adopting a helpless antelope calf - after she killed its mother			1
the intimidating beast had just finished devouring a @entity7 , and had the wounds to show for it , when its terrified child emerged			2
instead of making the defenceless infant her dessert , however , the merciful creature took pity on it and carried it away to safety			1
@entity17 : after killing and eating this antelope 's mother , the lioness reacts to the baby kob 's arrival with a roar of suspicion one - sided meeting : the powerful predator crouches down on her haunches and looks ready to pounce on the terrified little creature hear me roar ! the lioness tries to scare off the unsteady little calf with a deafening rumble please be my friend : the lonely , motherless kob refuses to run away from the intimidating sight photographer @entity35 , 50 , captured this fascinating display of nature in its purest beauty at every stage			2
the lioness first stares at the calf in shock , before roaring angrily at it to make it go away			2
finally , her maternal instincts take over , and after batting the quivering calf with a paw , she picks up the orphaned baby and carries it off like one of her own cubs			1
other tourists in the @entity54 , @entity55 , later reported seeing the calf running around unharmed , so its luck clearly held out			1
brazen : the lioness looks completely nonplussed when the offspring of her natural enemy begins nuzzling at her feet close encounter : the intimate shots were captured at @entity55 's @entity54 confused emotions : the pitying lioness gently pats at the innocent child of her prey from moments earlier mr @entity35 said : ' i was told there were two lionesses close by feeding on a kill so i went to go take some wildlife pictures			1
' when i got there , i saw the lionesses feeding on a @entity55 kob 's carcass			1
' i followed them for a while and they went up a tree to rest from the sun. ' i was watching them when i heard a noise - it was the kob 's fawn that had been hiding in the long grass			0
@entity92 : the fascinating pictures show the incredible workings of nature unfair fight : the larger creatures evidently decided she should protect the little antelope , despite them being natural enemies firm friends : she carries it off by the scruff of the neck , as with a cub , not by the front as she would a kill stunning scene : photographer @entity110 captured the heart - stopping episode at @entity54 , @entity55 ' one of the lionesses heard it too and came down from the tree			1
the kob is an antelope found across @entity119 in the northern savannah			0
they are usually found in floodplain grasslands , where there is an abundance of water and green grass			0
@entity127 tend to be inactive during the heat of the day and live in groups of females and calves or just males			0
' the fawn just stood there before running into the lioness			0
it went between its legs like it was trying to get its milk			0
' the lioness was really confused and they stood there for around 45 minutes			0
' then a park ranger turned up on his motorbike which made a really loud noise , which i think frightened the animals			2
' so the lioness picked the fawn up by the neck and carried it off like one of its own			1
' we heard from a group of tourists that the fawn was later spotted alive and well			0
