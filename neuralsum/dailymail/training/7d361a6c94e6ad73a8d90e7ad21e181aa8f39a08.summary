for the 15 year - old skating sensation , who became the youngest skating gold medalist in 78 years when anchoring @entity3 to team gold on the ice , is set to have the biggest impact on an @entity12 for @entity3 since the ' @entity21 , ' @entity14 , came out of the @entity22 to enchant the world and take gold as a 17 year - old at the @entity25 in 1972			1

that dazzling performance of brilliant skating , technique and composure under pressure has made her the darling of @entity3 with a back story that has fascinated the rest of the world			1
it has been reported that @entity3 state officials have been ordered to trace her father , @entity58 , who never returned to his pregnant wife , @entity59 , after being conscripted in the @entity60			1
miss @entity8 , who has never seen her father and carries her mother 's surname , was born and raised in @entity3 's fourth city @entity65 , in the @entity66 and on the edge of @entity68			1
a neighbour in @entity65 , @entity70 recalled : ' when @entity8 's mother @entity59 became pregnant , her father @entity58 was conscripted into the army and did not return			1
' it is said immediately after the army , he moved to another city			1
@entity59 raised her daughter alone			1
she had to work at several jobs , even on the local market , to make ends meet			1
i remember @entity59 returning home frozen after a day on the market in freezing temperatures			1
she worked so hard to provide and support @entity8			1
' @entity85 , @entity8 's former coach in @entity65 , said : ' her mother brought @entity8 to our sport school ' @entity87 '			1
she was just four years old			1
' i remember when i saw this girl at her casting			2
i was struck by her confident look , fearlessness , and thought , " if only i can train her			2
" so i was lucky '			2
@entity5 congratulates @entity8 after she skated to glory at the @entity12 incredible : @entity8 's spins mesmerised a partisan crowd @entity100 : @entity3 's @entity8 performs her amazing routine flexible : @entity8 put on an incredible show at the @entity104 at the age of 10 years , @entity8 and her mother moved to @entity107 to continue training			1
' almost from the first day it became clear that she was not like the others			2
she stood out for her brightness , activity and extraordinary seriousness			2
' off the rink , she could joke , but when she stepped on the ice , there left no trace of laughter			2
figure skating she always treated as to a job			2
i would say too seriously and responsibly			2
' i have never seen her cry			2
even when she fell , she felt pain , but she took her courage into both hands , rose and ran on			2
' even my older children when they came to watch the kids training were amazed at @entity8 's activity			1
i always told them , ' you should follow her example			2
' she was literally on fire with skating			2
she was always last from the ice rink			0
when i told her , " @entity8 , let 's finish up , stop " , then each time heard in response : ' no , still one last time			1
'' despite this dedication , the move to @entity107 nearly did n't take place and miss @entity8 considered abandoning top skating			1
the now champion said : ' my mother asked : do we finish it all or we will try to ride on ? i could now say that everything depended on my decision			0
although at the moment i would not be upset , in ending the training for ever - even the thought that finishing with this sport would be great - but then i was suddenly struck : ' stop ! and why must i finish ? ' so i told to my mother : ' @entity151 ' ' my mother gave up everything for me			0
in @entity65 , she had a job and an apartment in the centre of the city , and her whole life			0
and in @entity107 - nothing			0
we did not even know where we will live			0
it is now all normal			0
' the journey was across two time zones , and 1120 miles			0
@entity8 is set to have the biggest impact on an @entity12 for @entity3 since the ' @entity21 , ' 17 year - old @entity14 at the @entity25 in 1972 @entity8 leaves the ice after competing in the women 's team free skate figure skating competition miss @entity8 , who now lives in an apartment in @entity107 , said : ' i remember that for two days we were travelling by car ... i mostly looked out the window , how beautiful , how the landscape changed ... we were not going for three days , but to change our life			1
with all our things in one car			0
' she added : ' my mother does n't work now			0
so i am the only breadwinner in the family			0
we want to buy our own house very much			0
when you do n't have a house , it 's such a headache			0
' one of her greatest problems now , coach @entity184 says , is keeping her weight down : ' she struggles with it ... in my work , i never faced such cases - she just can not eat at all			0
and i 'm very sorry that she had to endure so much , but i can not help it			0
' ' it is great that she copes with it			0
when she needed to lose weight , she could eat only the powder ' squeeze ' - a fibre that gives energy			0
' it is hard , and the weight goes down very slowly - from 100 grams per day			1
but she copes , thank @entity201			0
' last season her weight changed and it caused her injury			0
now @entity8 holds her weight , self - controlled , although it is very difficult			1
' @entity205 , right , speaks with @entity8 as they stand on the podium during the flower ceremony miss @entity8 admitted : ' i have to refuse everything , the things that i like most , i was forbidden			1
i do not put on high heels at all now			0
i understand that i need to protect my legs			0
i would not say that i get tired of restraining			0
i think of it that if something is impossible , i do not want this			0
' as with many @entity3 athletes , she does not go to school but is taught at home , lessons fitting in around training			0
in the team event , miss @entity8 performed to the music from @entity226 , @entity227 's film of the @entity228 , while symbolically wearing a red coat			1
@entity226 is shot almost entirely in black - and - white but in a couple of scenes a small girl is spotted in the middle distance wearing a red coat - first in the @entity237 ghetto , then later on a pile of bodies			0
the sight signals a quiet turning point for the hero , @entity243 , played by @entity244 , and his mission to save his ' list ' of prisoners from the gas chambers			0
it is not known what music she will perform to tonight when she faces world and @entity254 champion @entity253 , of @entity255 , dubbed the ' ice queen ' at the start of a two - day showdown that all of @entity3 awaits .			1

@entity8 , 15 , has become the biggest star of the @entity7
