campaigners against violence towards women criticised the ' incredibly lenient penalty '			0
@entity36 , former chairman of @entity37 and professor of criminology at @entity39 , asked ' what it takes for a doctor to be struck off '			2
she said : ' this doctor has committed a number of sexual offences on a woman who was in a very vulnerable position			2
' a six - month suspension is an incredibly lenient penalty and the question remains : what will happen within the six months that will supposedly change his behaviour when he returns to work ? ' the doctor , who had recently completed gp training and was undergoing specialist training in psychiatry , was on a locum shift at the @entity59 department of @entity60 , @entity61 , when the divorcee was brought in after taking a ' substantial overdose '			1

a report into his actions stated that he put his arm around her and stroked her chest			2
it added : ' she informed the panel she was " scared , frozen to the spot " and said " i was unsure , he was a doctor "			0
suspended : @entity20 said dr @entity0 ( pictured ) should be struck off ' she said when you saw the picture of her [ breast ] feeding her son you said " they 're big			1
are they as big as that now ? " and squeezed her left breast			0
' when she stormed off to her kitchen @entity0 followed her and kept trying to kiss her , saying at one point : ' i can see it in your eyes that you want it			1
' @entity0 , who qualified in 2005 from the @entity102 , called her after he left but the woman , who was 43 at the time , texted : ' it was not right what you tried to do			1
you are a doctor and i was your patient			0
i did n't want or asked to be touched by you			0
