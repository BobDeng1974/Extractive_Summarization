@entity1 will be back , raising one of the biggest cheers of the night , and , unlike last year , @entity4 will take centre stage , but when @entity6 take on @entity7 at @entity8 on wednesday night , the stakes will go beyond merely contesting the right to play in the @entity11 quarter finals @entity13 ’s future as manager at @entity7 will hang in the balance , as will the competing philosophies at the respective clubs			1
in a battle of old money versus new money it ’s not often @entity22 ’s @entity6 are consigned to the former category , the frugal , traditional team taking on the gaudy spendthrifts			2
@entity13 's position as @entity7 manager is under threat despite domestic dominance in @entity30 @entity32 's crucial away goal has given @entity6 the edge in the tie ahead of wednesday 's game but with @entity6 having grown out of their own age of extravagance , it is @entity39 - backed @entity7 who have fallen foul of @entity44 ’s new @entity43 rules			1
when @entity45 makes his barbed comments about clubs which ‘ think they can over-ride what @entity43 says ’ he has @entity7 in his sights as much as @entity51			2
and perhaps understandably so ; despite being fined , like @entity51 , £ 49 million for breaching the @entity43 rules , told by @entity44 to break even by 2016 , to not increase their wage bill and to limit transfers , the club managed to spend £ 43m on @entity1			0
and , according to reports in @entity30 , the club ’s provisional budget for turnover next season has risen again to £ 350million after increased sponsorship deals with @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 – all in addition to the disputed £ 150m four - year deal they have with the @entity72 , which @entity44 refused to accept was a fair market price for a secondary sponsor			2
@entity45 has complained about the @entity77 club 's extensive spending , but @entity43 has had little impact former @entity30 defender @entity79 knows his bosses expect the team to progress beyond the last 16 @entity7 captain @entity82 has spoken of his desire for the club to challenge @entity44 's major powers all of which leads the club to believe that their dream of winning the @entity11 within the next few years can be achieved			1
‘ i do not think the project here is stalling at all , it was always going to be a big project , ’ said @entity82 , captain and @entity1 ’s defensive partner			0
‘ the owners aim is to have us on the same level as @entity97 and @entity98			0
we know that we have the players to be able to win the @entity11 , and even with the very difficult game against @entity6 - we have to believe that this year can be our year			1
’ that goal appeared a distinct possibility when @entity104 ’s side ran @entity106 close in the @entity11 quarter finals in 2013 , being knocked out on away goals			1
and when they beat @entity6 3 - 1 at @entity111 in the first leg of the quarter final meeting last year , they appeared to be continuing their growth			1
but a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity8 saw them ejected from the competition and they are now are in danger of exiting in the last 16			0
@entity82 praised the professionalism of his team - mate , and former @entity6 defender , @entity1 ( right ) @entity1 was on the other side when the teams met in the quarter final last year , when @entity6 progressed @entity7 will take heart from the first leg in @entity111 , where @entity6 were hanging on to the 1 - 1 draw by the end and the fact that last year @entity7 were missing an injured @entity4 at @entity8			1
‘ we are better equipped than last year to beat @entity6 , ’ said @entity82			2
‘ even if you look at the game in @entity77 , we were the better team no doubt			0
if it was not for an unbelievable performance from their goalkeeper we would have won the game and would be travelling to @entity138 with the lead , we must take heart from that			0
‘ @entity1 is very excited to go back to @entity6			0
he had great memories there , he helped them to win the @entity11 - so i would be very surprised if the @entity6 fans gave him anything other than a fantastic reception			2
@entity149 looked to have given @entity7 a winning lead in the first leg last season , but @entity6 hit back @entity154 's last - gasp goal put @entity6 through , but @entity7 are confident they can win this time around @entity156 scores against @entity7 in 2013 , when it looked like the @entity159 side were on the brink of @entity44 's elite ' he is a winner though , yes he has good memories of @entity6 , but his only objective will be to knock them out - and for us to progress			1
’ @entity13 ’s future remains uncertain			0
though form has improved since the embarrassing 4 - 2 defeat at @entity170 at the turn of the year and despite thrashing @entity172 on saturday , @entity167 will overtake them if they win at @entity174 on sunday			0
they knocked @entity175 out of the domestic cup last week to reach the semi-finals and are in the @entity179 final – but give that their budget is more than three times the size of @entity167 , even a domestic treble may not save @entity13			1
with @entity183 looking likely to sign a new deal with @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 look the most likely candidates to take over form @entity13 for next season			0
and should @entity7 ’s @entity192 dream die on wednesday in @entity138 , @entity44 ’s leading coaches can expect to be fielding fresh inquiries from the @entity39 owners .			1

@entity7 owners have invested *hugely* in squad without @entity192 success
@entity159 club went out to @entity6 in quarter finals last year
@entity13 's side are top of @entity205 and on course for a domestic treble
but unless they win at @entity210 could be out of a *job*
