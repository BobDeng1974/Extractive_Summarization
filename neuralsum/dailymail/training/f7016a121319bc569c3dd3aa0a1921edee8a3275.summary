by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 8 november 2013 with the latest film of the @entity4 trilogy , @entity3 , hitting our screens this month , just as the @entity6 season kicks off in earnest , we 're thinking that tribute - style hair and make - up , as overseen by the glamorous @entity9 , is just the inspiration we 've been looking for			1
but , if you do n't have your very own @entity12 on hand , do n't panic			0
this week , we caught up with top make - up artist @entity15 who has worked with a-listers from @entity17 and @entity18 to @entity19 and @entity20 , and will be prepping the @entity4 stars for the red carpet at next week 's @entity3 premiere			1
while you might think that the @entity25 looks are a little too extreme for real life , @entity15 explains that they can be made much more wearable			1
' but i definitely think that these futuristic trends are starting to make their way into the mainstream			1
more and more people are wearing strong colours and feeling free to experiment more , and beauty brands are allowing them to experiment with innovative textures and shades			0
' here 's @entity15 's step - by - step guide to getting a @entity4 - inspired party look			1
1 ) flawless skin ' @entity47 has amazing skin – and in fact everyone in the @entity25 has this really ethereal luminosity to their complexion			1
in real life , that means cleansing properly			0
i use @entity59 's @entity58 ( £ 71 , johnlewis.com ) , which is expensive but it 's brilliant and lasts forever			2
once skin ’s clean , start with @entity63 's @entity62 ( £ 25 , boots.com ) it ’s a very sheer pale pearlescent primer with gold flecks that suits all skintones and i use that as the base for a really luminous look			2
i particularly concentrate on the tops of the cheeks , the brow , the centre of the nose , the @entity75 's bow of the lips and the chin			2
flawless complexion : actor @entity79 ( @entity80 ) parades @entity47 ( @entity81 ) for the second instalement of the @entity4 : catching fire 2 ) conceal and mattify once you 've created that luminous base , you need to conceal as required			1
i use @entity87 correctors and concealers ( £ 18.50 , bobbibrown.co.uk ) wherever they 're needed			0
a little bit under the eyes , a touch around the nose , and on any blemishes			0
then , tap on a little bit of translucent powder			0
the @entity96 ( £ 18 , boots.com ) regulates oil and moisturises the skin so it does a great job of taking away the ugly shine , while keeping the dewy glow that you want			2
@entity12 aka @entity103 shows off his sparkling side in @entity4 by adorning gold eye liner 3 ) liquid gold liner in the film @entity12 wears a really stunning gold eyeliner and i think that 's a really fabulous look for parties			1
i use @entity112 in @entity113 ( £ 19.50 , gurumakeupemporium.com ) - just add a tiny bit of water and you 've got a liquid liner			2
i use it with the @entity119 ( £ 16 , boots.com ) to get it just where i want it			0
liquid liner like this last longer than pens or pencils and is more precise			0
if you 've never used liquid liner before , i recommend putting a mirror on the table and looking down into it with your elbow resting on the table - it 's easier than trying to close one eye			1
finish with a bit of mascara - i like @entity87 's @entity138 ( £ 19 , bobbibrown.co.uk ) because the brush is brilliant - and remember to take it right from the base of the lashes			1
contouring looks : katniss played by @entity47 shows off her chameleon style @entity146 ( @entity9 ) showcases a range of bright lipsticks and colourful make - up 4 ) @entity143 this is a real make - up artist 's trick			1
use a fan brush or an angled soft dome brush and just remember that whatever you make darker recedes , and whatever you make lighter comes forward			0
a little goes a long way so use a light hand and matte brown shade - i use one from the @entity161 in @entity162 ( £ 27.95 , gurumakeupemporium.com ) - just under the cheeks and then a lighter one			0
to get that almost ghostly effect , rather than using a flat light shade , i like @entity167 's @entity166 in @entity168 ( £ 20 , maccosmetics.co.uk ) - a touch under the eyebrow , down the centre of the nose and on the @entity75 's bow of the lips			1
blend well - you do n't want any 1980s , @entity177 - style stripes			1
@entity179 's @entity178 was given a @entity4 makeover by @entity15 before and after : @entity178 is given a @entity25 - inspired party look featuring gold eyeliner as seen on stylist @entity12 and a glittering red lip as worn by @entity9 5 ) red lips for modern red lips , you do n't have to worry about liner , just keep it soft and pretty			1
i 'm using @entity190 in n ° 41 , @entity191 ( £ 25 , johnlewis.com ) , but if you 're scared of red , the one shade i 've found that really suits everyone is @entity196 ( £ 15 , boots.com )			0
i use a brush - @entity199 's lip brush is the best i 've found as it 's curved at the end so sweeps into the lip shape and helps to keep the edges soft and wearable			2
' ' to up the glamour for a party , i love a bit of glitter			0
i used a brush to apply red glitter - i use a @entity167 one that i picked up in the @entity211 but you can use any brand - on top of the red lipstick			0
it lasts longer than you might expect - although it 's probably worth drinking through a straw			2
' ' oh , and a top tip for getting rid of stray glitter : use a clean mascara wand , it takes it straight off			0

make - up artists are taking inspiration from the film 's futuristic styling
*rainbow* - coloured @entity9 is seen as the @entity25 's fashion icon
character 's bright style can be recreated for a cool @entity6 look
