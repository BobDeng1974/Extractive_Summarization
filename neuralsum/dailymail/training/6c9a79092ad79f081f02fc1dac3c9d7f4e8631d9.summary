by @entity0 hundreds of railway stations are to open ‘ click and collect ’ stores , including changing rooms , for people to pick up their internet purchases women shopping on the web for the perfect little black dress or a new pair of shoes will be able to collect them up the following day from the train station as they make their way home			1
many of the outlets will have changing rooms to allow people to try on their latest purchases and return them immediately if they do n’t fit or match expectations			1
hundreds of railway stations are to open @entity20 click and collect stores where customers can pick up their internet purchases and try them on			1
pictured is the first such store in @entity25 big brands such as the fashion chains @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , have joined the initiative with many other stores and courier firms expected to follow suit			1
open seven days a week , the shops will fit around people ’s busy lifestyles and enable them to choose exactly how , when and where they receive or return internet purchases			2
the initiative offers huge benefits for shoppers , who do not have to wait at home for deliveries , while retailers can save on couriers by dropping items off at one central hub			2
there will also be an associated website and notifications service through text message and email to let customers know when their parcel has arrived			0
the scheme is the result of a £ 24million joint venture between @entity57 , which runs the nation ’s stations , and the founder of the @entity62 currency bureaux chain , @entity60			0
the first of the chain of click and collect stores , which is called @entity66 , has opened in @entity25 with others to follow at @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 before the end of august			1
the rest of the 300 will open over the next three years , creating an estimated 3,000 jobs in a venture that will turn railway stations into internet shopping hubs			2
the @entity81 service is the only one of its kind that is available to every retailer , e-tailer , parcel carrier and shipper , creating a network of hubs for the collection and return of web purchases			0
customers using the service pay no fee provided the retailer , such as @entity26 , is an official @entity81 partner			2
however , people can also choose to get items from other web outlets delivered to the chain ’s railway shops for a small fee , which is likely to be less than £ 5			0
a @entity66 spokesman said : ‘ the service will allow consumers to combine collections and returns from multiple retailers into one trip at a time that suits them or coincides with an already planned journey			2
’ big brands such as the fashion chains @entity26 , @entity27 ( @entity115 branch pictured ) and @entity28 , have joined the initiative - with many other stores and courier firms expected to follow suit chief executive , @entity120 , who was previously a senior executive at @entity57 , said : ‘ we created @entity66 to improve the online shopping experience			1
we ’re not another ‘ me too ’ click and collect offer , it ’s a game - changing service consumers are crying out for but no one else can provide			1
‘ we offer a premium service with contemporary shops , advanced technology and highly trained staff delivering a dedicated customer experience			0
‘ it is the next major step in online shopping , providing a parcel collection , returns and delivery service that has customer choice and convenience at its very heart			0
what ’s more , we are delivery carrier and retailer agnostic so any brand can offer the @entity81 service to their customers			0
’ @entity149 , @entity57 ’s managing director , network operations said : ‘ more people are travelling by rail than ever before and stations have become more than just a place to wait for , or get off a train			0
we ’ve adapted to passengers ’ changing needs and now offer quality retail , food and drink at our biggest stations , such as @entity68			0
‘ introducing @entity66 to stations will enable us to reinvest our profits back into the railway and is a natural next step to help passengers and people who work and live near stations , whose lives are increasingly busy and on the move			1
