by @entity0 published : 20:36 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 21:05 est , 15 april 2013 injured : @entity2 's @entity1 is trying a controversial treatment to help his ankle recover called @entity5 when @entity2 ’s star @entity1 suffered an ankle injury earlier this month , he turned to a controversial blood - spinning treatment to get himself back on his feet			1
the technique involves taking a small amount of blood ( 10 - 40ml , roughly one or two tablespoons ) from a patient ’s arm and then spinning it at high speed in a machine called a centrifuge for ten minutes			1
this high - speed spin causes the blood to separate into its various components			1
specifically , it allows platelets ( the parts of blood that promote clotting and assist the healing process ) and plasma ( the liquid part of blood in which red and white blood cells are suspended ) to separate from other components in the blood			2
by removing the other components , it means the concentration of platelets in the plasma is up to five times higher than normal			0
known as @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , it contains large amounts of natural growth factors — substances the body uses to heal tissue			0
the patient ’s @entity5 is then immediately injected back into the injured area of the body — in @entity1 ’s case , his right ankle			1
the idea is that it jump - starts recovery , reducing pain and making the injury heal up to five times faster			1
this quick and easy treatment has been shown to work for a range of ailments , from arthritic joints to foot pain , and it is increasingly being used within the @entity54			1
so should you try blood spinning for your creaky knees and old sporting injuries ? dr @entity59 , a private doctor specialising in sports and orthopaedic medicine at @entity63 ’s @entity62 , believes the treatment holds genuine benefits			1
‘ within our blood , we have cells that begin the healing process , ’ says dr @entity59 , who has been using the @entity5 technique for four years			2
‘ when you injure yourself , the body ’s first response is inflammation			2
this sends platelets to the site of injury , which kick - starts the body to repair itself			1
’ drama : @entity1 during the @entity83 match , when he injured his ankle			1
he is hoping that it will heal five times faster than normal with the treatment the ‘ super-shot ’ of platelets boosts this healing mechanism , he explains , so recovery is faster			2
furthermore , this high concentration of platelets seems to enhance healing so that the body produces less scar tissue			0
blood spinning — or , as it is technically known , @entity5 — has been around since the @entity97 , when it was first used following open heart surgery to avoid giving excessive amounts of donated blood products , which could contain disease or trigger an immune reaction			1
since then , it has been used in orthopaedics to ease arthritic joints and painful knees , in neurosurgery , wound healing , ear , nose and throat surgery , and face and head surgery			0
it has even been used in cosmetic treatments , in a procedure called the @entity117 , which involves injecting a form of @entity5 into areas of the face to rejuvenate the skin			0
treatment : blood spinning , as in the case of @entity1 , has been used to ease painful joints since the @entity97 earlier this year , the government body @entity125 ( the @entity125 ) issued new guidelines acknowledging @entity5 as a treatment for tendon injuries , common in the elbow , knee and ankle , and plantar fasciitis — inflammation of the band of tissue that stretches from the heel to the middle of the foot			1
this common condition affects around one in ten people at some point in their lives and can be triggered by long periods walking or standing , walking in flat shoes , over-exercising or obesity			0
dr @entity59 explains that the treatment seems particularly effective at treating tendons , which are notoriously difficult to heal due to their poor blood supply			1
effective : the treatment means that there is a five times higher concentration of platelets in the blood , which help the body to heal tissue over recent years , the @entity5 treatment has started to grow in popularity , especially for sports injuries , and is now available on the @entity54 for orthopaedic problems such as tennis and golfer ’s elbow , shoulder injuries and @entity168 problems , and privately at around £ 2,000 for three treatments			1
two or more injections may be needed , between four and six weeks apart , depending on the injury			2
for best results , dr @entity59 says that physiotherapy should be performed alongside the treatment			2
as yet , it is available in only around a dozen places on the @entity54 , and there are no figures on how frequently it is used			1
the slow uptake may be due to the fact that the technique has been mired in controversy , with some experts arguing there is still little proof that it works			0
indeed , while @entity125 says the treatment raises ‘ no major safety concerns ’ , it adds : ‘ the evidence on efficacy is inadequate in quantity and quality			0
therefore , this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance , consent and audit or research			0
’ @entity200 , professor of sport and exercise medicine at @entity203 , agrees that more evidence is needed before we can start routinely offering blood spinning to patients			2
‘ there may be some benefit in the use of these types of injections in the healing process , ’ he says			0
‘ however , it is very difficult to find strong , coherent evidence that it works			0
’ a study of people with injured achilles tendons — the fibrous tissue that connects the calf to the heel bone — published in @entity223 in 2010 found that @entity5 injections were no more effective than saltwater			0
yet some of the world ’s top sports stars , including footballer @entity229 and golfer @entity230 , have used the @entity5 treatment for their injuries , and small studies show promising results			2
blood supply : the technique , available on the @entity54 , is particularly effective for healing tendons which have limited blood reaching them one study of 15 patients with elbow pain published in the @entity242 found that 60 per cent had improved symptoms after eight weeks , and 81 per cent at six months			1
there were no adverse effects or complications			0
dr @entity59 says the @entity248 has been slow to adopt the procedure compared with the @entity250 and @entity251			0
‘ the @entity253 sports medicine community has frowned upon this technique , with many doctors thinking it does n’t work			0
as a result , the @entity248 have been latecomers to the technique			0
while it is true there is still much to learn about this treatment , in general @entity5 theoretically makes sense : it is the body healing itself			0
’ in @entity1 ’s case , @entity2 doctors hope @entity5 will do the trick			1
with treatment , it is hoped he will miss only a handful of games , and that the forward will soon be back to his top goal - scoring form .			2

blood - spinning , in use since the *1980s* , increasingly available on the @entity54
