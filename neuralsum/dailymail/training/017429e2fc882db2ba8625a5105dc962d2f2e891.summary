you can order a cup of coffee in hundreds of different way – and soon you could be able to personalise a pint of beer too			1
engineers have developed a ‘ barista - type experience ’ for beer drinkers where a barman can adjust a gadget fitted to a beer tap to adjust the ‘ hoppiness ’ level on demand			1
the ' @entity16 ' device means that new flavours of beer could be created by drinkers to suit their tastes			1
engineers at @entity40 claim to have ‘ transformed ’ the brewing and dry - hopping process , which usually tales two weeks , to enable consumers to change the flavour of beer in seconds			1
‘ essentially , we ’re making an “ espresso ” of beer , said @entity47 , head of food and beverage systems at @entity40			1
the beer is pumped at high pressure ( nine bar ) across natural hops ( pictured )			1
this allows the flavour of the hops to be extracted very quickly			2
drinkers can choose between different hops flavours the ' espresso machine meets beer font ' gadget is attached to a barrel of standard beer			1
the beer tap has an attachment on it that looks like it comes from a coffee machine			0
the beer is pumped at high pressure ( nine bar ) across natural hops			1
this allows the flavour of the hops to be extracted very quickly			2
drinkers can choose between different hops flavours and intensities to personalise their beer			1
the gadget is currently a prototype			0
‘ we ’ve taken our expertise in fluid technology and beverage systems , and transferred that knowledge between different industries – using some of the secrets of successful coffee machines to enable us to create personalised beer that is fresh and natural			0
‘ we knew , for example , that pressure is fundamental to extracting flavour in espresso machines – so part of our investigation was to see whether it does anything for beer			2
‘ as a result , we have speeded up the dry - hopping process – and , by adding extra hops at the point of dispense , their volatile aromas are as fresh and intense as possible			0
' the beer tap has an attachment similar to one seen on an espresso machine through which beer is pumped at high pressure			1
the liquid passes across hops to rapidly extract their flavour			0
in this way , the flavour of the beer can be changed			0
mr @entity47 added : ' the aroma of the finished pint can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the quantity of hops and by changing the type of hops used			0
’ he believes that the machine gives brands to stand out in a crowded marketplace			0
‘ it ’s a way of building on the current trend of personalisation to create new experiences and add value for the consumer , ’ he said			0
the scientists will demonstrate their personalised beer technology at the @entity133 , on december 2 in @entity134 , @entity135			0
the ' @entity16 ' device ( pictured ) means that new flavours of beer could be created by drinkers to suit their tastes			2
the beer is pumped through a pressurised nozzle to rapidly extract the flavour of hops			2

engineers at @entity40 developed the prototype machine
it *'s* a hybrid of an espresso machine and a beer font
device uses high pressure to extract flavour from the hops quickly
drinkers can choose between flavours to personalise a pint of beer
