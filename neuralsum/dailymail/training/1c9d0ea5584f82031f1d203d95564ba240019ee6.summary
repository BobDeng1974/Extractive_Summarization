by @entity0 @entity1 lost £ 120,000 when he was conned by a fraudster with a love for the glamorous lifestyle depicted in @entity6 films @entity1 was on his way to meet a friend for lunch when the call came			1
it was one of the partners from the author ’s accountancy firm			1
‘ he said , “ your accountant , @entity15 , has been sacked			1
your money ’s gone , you ’d better call your solicitor			2
’ the 59 - year - old , best known for his novel @entity23 and the screenplay for hit film @entity25 , is a master storyteller but even he could not have predicted the drama that has unfolded since that fateful call in july 2012			1
@entity1 had invested £ 120,000 in a property scheme at the suggestion of @entity30 , a partner with @entity32 , a reputable @entity34 accountancy firm			1
@entity15 seemed conscientious , hard working and utterly dependable			1
in reality , he was a conman			1
a tubby 41 - year - old who was obsessed with @entity6 , he stole £ 2.4 million from clients , family and friends – partly to impress his @entity43 wife whom he had married in secret			1
@entity32 denied any knowledge of @entity15 ’s actions , meaning the money – which @entity1 had set aside for his three sons ’ education – had gone			1
last wednesday , @entity15 pleaded guilty to 34 theft and fraud offences at @entity53 and was jailed for eight years			1
recalling his first meeting with @entity15 in january 2011 at his home in @entity57 ’s @entity56 , @entity58 , @entity1 says : ‘ he was an @entity60 boy , very clever , glasses , small , sweet , charming , very bright			1
‘ everybody said he was really good at his job , knew the law , knew accountancy			2
‘ @entity32 was a respected firm that had been around for years so there was no reason why you would have any suspicions			1
‘ having an accountant is like having a doctor or a solicitor			1
you expect them to be decent people – not complete lunatics who are going to steal all your money			2
’ so when , in september that year , @entity15 told him about an investment opportunity , @entity1 had no reason to doubt him			1
it was a short - term investment , over 120 days , and promised a return of 15 per cent			2
criminal accountant @entity15 was aiming for a dream lifestyle as depicted in the @entity6 films the author invested £ 50,000 and after receiving a payment of £ 7,500 on that initial deposit , he put in a further £ 70,000			1
he says : ‘ i do n’t have any interest in money or know anything about it			2
it ’s like putting a car in a garage			2
you expect , when you pick it up , it will work and you do n’t have to know all the details			2
’ but there was no property deal , only a woman and spiralling debts			2
unbeknown to his family , @entity15 had married @entity102 in 2009			1
bizarrely , the court heard the union was not consummated			2
meanwhile , during their marriage , @entity102 went back to @entity43 three times , each time coming back pregnant by her ex-boyfriend			1
according to former schoolfriends , he was teetotal with a modest lifestyle , living in his grandmother ’s old house in the grounds of his parents ’ home in @entity117 , @entity118			2
but in court it emerged he had spent thousands of pounds on @entity121 , taking her on shopping sprees and splurging on luxury hotels			1
‘ he seemed the sort of guy who was very sexually inexperienced , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ he was a little fat , rather unattractive			2
presumably he ’d met this young woman and never had much fun before			2
‘ he liked @entity131 and had lots of @entity6 memorabilia , which is not a good sign in a grown man			1
@entity15 pleaded guilty for fraud against @entity1 at @entity53 particularly a small chubby accountant who fancied himself as some sort of criminal			1
’ but when , in may 2012 , @entity1 discovered his account had been emptied , it did n’t occur to him to suspect @entity15			1
‘ i was at the @entity142 and tried to transfer some money			2
they said i had n’t got any			0
i said , “ where ’s it gone ? i was only in here yesterday putting some money in , ” and they replied , “ oh no , you ’ve taken it all out			0
you went to this branch and you signed here , we had your driving licence and you ’ve taken all the money out			0
” ‘ i knew the money had been transferred so i went into the @entity159 next door , where i ’ve never had an account , and asked if they had an account in the name of @entity1			0
i said , “ well , i ’m @entity1 , can i have the details ? ” and they said , “ we ’re not sure you ’re him , he was in here yesterday			0
” i gave them my @entity173 and they said , “ well , he had @entity173			0
” ‘ the first person i rang was my accountant and he said , “ how terrible ”			1
i asked him to come down and he replied he would if he could but he could n’t make it			0
‘ i remember my ex-girlfriend saying the only person with access to my driving licence was my accountant			1
even then i did n’t think it was him			0
i thought maybe someone broke into my house and copied it			0
’ with the fraud – if not the culprit – exposed , the money was back in his @entity142 account the next day			1
@entity1 's most famous novel is @entity23 and has been translated into 20 languages but then two months later , @entity15 was fired from @entity32 , and @entity1 discovered he ’d lost £ 120,000 in investments			1
yet @entity15 insisted to @entity1 and his tens of other victims that he was going to get their money back			1
he says : ‘ he claimed it had n’t been stolen but misplaced			0
‘ as a writer , i was fascinated by the crime – that @entity200 thing			1
indeed , @entity200 was swindled by his accountant			1
‘ and i was fascinated by him			0
he was such a bizarre character			0
‘ he ’d come from a semi-rural proletarian background in @entity118			0
he was working with writers , had a huge 4x4 car , a big income			0
so the idea that he would make a bit more by risking everything was crazy			0
it was so destructive , so idiotic			0
the truth is , i think he was bipolar			0
he got really , really manic , he was n’t sleeping , he was running around , moving money here there and everywhere			0
it was a kind of mania			0
when i met him , he was turning bad			0
’ @entity15 was arrested and charged in march 2013			1
even then , @entity1 continued to see him			0
‘ he was very smart			0
by the end i wanted to kill him			0
one day , he suddenly looked at me and said , “ you ca n’t kill me			0
people have been coming to the house trying to kill me in the last few days and the police have offered me protection			0
” ‘ by then i think he ’d got involved with other criminals and there were quite heavy people chasing him			0
i do believe he was working really hard to get the money back – that was his only hope , if he could go to the judge and say i ’ve got it all back			0
’ @entity1 also wrote the screenplay for the film @entity25 , featuring @entity232 ( right ) and his victims ’ only hope too			0
with @entity32 denying all responsibility , their only option was to take legal action			0
@entity1 says : ‘ all your money ’s gone , then you ’re speaking to solicitors who are charging £ 500 an hour , who all say you ’re going to have to sue the accountants and by the end you ’re going to have to get a barrister and it ’s going to cost you £ 25,000			2
you fall into a pit of horror thinking , “ not only have i lost £ 100,000 , i ’m going to have to spend £ 50,000 to get this back and i may not win			1
” ’ the author eventually reached a settlement with the firm a few months ago			2
he says : ‘ there are people far worse off than me who have lost everything			2
‘ the accountants behaved very badly			0
@entity15 was a criminal and that ’s that			1
you ca n’t expect him to be a nice fella			0
’ @entity259 partner @entity258 said : ‘ @entity15 was not acting on behalf of @entity32 but in a personal capacity			1
‘ he acted without our knowledge			0
we have every sympathy for those who , like ourselves , were affected by the thefts and frauds			0
