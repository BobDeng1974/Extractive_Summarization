from an eerie - looking android to a smartphone - controlled dinosaur , @entity1 companies are out in full force to demonstrate their robotic prowess			1
the technology is being shown by exhibitors at @entity9 in @entity10 , which is taking place in @entity12 , near @entity13 until october 11			1
one of the most popular devices is @entity16 's dinosaur robot , the @entity17 , which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 ( 2.1 metre - tall ) reptile droid			1
@entity17 can also play trivia games as users answer questions through the app. another highlight is @entity39 's three - legged robot , which is capable of playing a relaxed game of ping pong			1
it watches its human opponent to predict the ball 's path , and can even decide to take it easy on opponents by missing a few hits			0

it watches its human opponent to predict the ball 's path weebles may seem like basic toys now , but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘ wobble but never fall down			0
’ to bring this childhood toy into the modern - day , a @entity1 firm has created a troop of @entity68 - style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball			1
and thanks to built - in gyroscopes and infrared sensors , the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over			1
the @entity76 were built by @entity77			0
instead of wheels , the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball , which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move			0
they remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors , which incorporate inverted - pendulum control technology , to detect tilt angles			2
similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras , car navigation systems , and more recently , the electronic stability control ( @entity92 ) systems that prevent cars from skidding			0
each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors , and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects , even in the dark			2
and , based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves , this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet ( 16 metre square ) space			0
with five motors to control paddle movement , it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return			0
' this ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner , ' said @entity118 , an @entity39 manager			1
' we envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something			2
' this would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately			2
' @entity22 also demonstrated its life - like communications android named ms @entity24			1
ms @entity24 uses sign language to introduce itself to humans			1
@entity22 describes the eerie android , which has blinking eyes and a fixed smile , as having the appearance of ' a friendly young woman			1
' at present , the android can mimic only simple movements , such as exchanging greetings and signing in @entity1			2
but the company soon hopes to integrate its technologies in areas including sensing , speech synthesis , speech recognition and robotic control to create a more social robot by 2020			2
the goal is to design a companion for the elderly and people with dementia , to offer telecounselling in natural speech , communicate through sign language , and allow healthcare to keep an eye on elderly people			0
meanwhile a group of 14 - inch ( 36cm ) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless choreography			2
@entity167 manufacturing , an electronic component manufacturer , presented the cheerleaders with colour - changing pom - poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance			0
' these robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents , in real time , the robots from clashing together , ' said @entity182 , a @entity167 engineer			0
with five motors to control paddle movement , the ping - poing robot is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return			1

over 500 companies and organisations are exhibiting at @entity10 , which will be held until october 11 in @entity12 , east of @entity13			1
a model displays @entity1 mobile communication giant @entity253 's mobile navigation device ' @entity254 ' ( @entity255 ) which uses tactile sensations to guide the user at the ceatec electronics trade show			0

show is taking place this year in @entity12 , east of @entity13 until october 11
one of the most popular devices is a dinosaur robot , the @entity32
a smartphone application can make the dinosaur walk or jump , or bark
a three - legged robot is on display playing ping pong against humans
