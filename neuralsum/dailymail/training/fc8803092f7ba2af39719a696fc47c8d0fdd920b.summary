by @entity0 last updated at 9:50 am on 24th january 2012 @entity3 's @entity2 probe has found that the dunes on the surface of @entity7 's @entity6 vary in shape just like dunes on @entity10 - and even look similar to deserts on our planet			1
the similarities end there , of course - not only are the dunes on @entity6 300 feet high and up to a mile wide , they 're made of frozen hydrocarbons - chemicals found in crude oil - rather than sand			2
there are four million square miles of dunes on @entity6 , an area the size of the @entity25			2
their formations could be key to understanding the clouded moon 's mysterious weather patterns			1
the huge dunes of frozen hydrocarbons on the surface of @entity7 's @entity6 were captured by @entity3 's @entity2 - and the geographical variations on @entity6 are similar to variations on @entity10 analysis of images sent back by @entity3 's orbiting @entity2 probe found that the dunes form patterns similar to deserts on @entity10			1
the result gives new clues about the moon ’s climatic and geological @entity45 fields are the second most dominant landform on @entity6 , after the seemingly uniform plains , so they offer a large - scale insight into the moon ’s peculiar environment			1
though similar in shape to the linear dunes found on @entity10 in @entity55 or the @entity56 , @entity6 ’s dunes are gigantic by our standards			1
they are on average 0.6 to 1.2 mileswide , hundreds of miles long and around 300 feet ( 100 meters ) high			2
however , their size and spacing vary across the surface , betraying the environment in which they have formed and evolved			2
artist 's conception of the dunes on @entity7 's moon : the dunes are up to 300 feet high and a mile wide , and made of frozen hydrocarbons - the chemicals found in crude oil - not sand using radar data from the @entity2 spacecraft , @entity78 , a former postdoctoral fellow at @entity3 ’s @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , and collaborators have discovered that the size of @entity6 ’s dunes is controlled by at least two factors : altitude and latitude			1
more elevated dunes tend to be thinner and more widely separated			0
the gaps between the dunes seem to appear to @entity2 ’s radar , indicating a thinner covering of sand			1
the sand needed to build the dunes seems to be mostly found in the lowlands of @entity95 think the sand on @entity6 is not made of silicates as on @entity10 , but of solid hydrocarbons , precipitated out of the atmosphere			1
these have then fiormed into grains 0.04 inch in size by a still unknown @entity104 terms of latitude , the sand dunes on @entity6 are confined to its equatorial region , in a band between 30 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees north latitude			0
however , the dunes tend to be less voluminous toward the north			0
@entity113 and colleagues think that this may be due to @entity7 ’s elliptical orbit			0
each season on @entity6 lasts for about seven years			0
the slightly elliptical nature of @entity7 ’s orbit means that the southern hemisphere of @entity6 has shorter but more intense summers			0
so the southern regions are probably drier , which implies they have less ground moisture			0
the drier the sand grains , the more easily they can be transported by the winds to make dunes			0
' as one goes to the north , we believe the soil moisture probably increases , making the sand particles less mobile and , as a consequence , the development of dunes more difficult , ' says @entity136 this hypothesis is the fact that @entity6 ’s lakes and seas are not distributed symmetrically by latitude			0
these reserves of liquid ethane and methane are predominantly found in the northern hemisphere , suggesting again that the soil is moister toward the north and so , again , the sand grains are less easy to transport by the wind			0
' understanding how the dunes form as well as explaining their shape , size and distribution on @entity6 ’s surface is of great importance to understanding @entity6 ’s climate and geology , ' says @entity158 , @entity159 ’s @entity2 project scientist .			1

different areas of icy moon have different
analysis of images by @entity3 's orbiting @entity2 probe
shapes are similar to deserts on @entity10
could offer insight into moon 's mysterious weather patterns
