by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 05:08 est , 8 march 2014 with its a-list approval , high price tag , long list of apparent benefits and rather bizarre formula , it sounds like the recipe for a miracle product			0
but critics have questioned whether @entity12 ’s favourite face cream has one key ingredient – the evidence to back it all up			0
experts claim that the £ 50 - a - bottle @entity16 – which contains brown algae and an enzyme from salmon eggs – is no more effective than an everyday moisturiser			1
criticism : claims made in advertisements for @entity25 , backed by 41 - year - old @entity12 , pictured , have been called into question by @entity28 medics who said the sample size of 40 was too small endorsed : miss @entity12 said she would never give her name to a cream which she did n't use herself and they condemned the decision to sign up miss @entity12 to promote the cream as shameless marketing			1
in a new advertisement , the actress , 41 , is quoted as saying : ‘ i love how it smells , that it works , the story and that fact that it is a brand started by a woman entrepreneur			1
i never promote anything that i do n’t use , love and believe in			2
’ praise : miss @entity12 said she liked that the cream was founded by a female entrepreneur the brand , meanwhile , claims its key ingredient , the ‘ @entity52 ’ salmon egg enzyme , exfoliates and adds protein while giving the same benefits as anti-ageing products such as glycolic acid and @entity58 but dermatologists in @entity61 ’s @entity28 were less enthusiastic , claiming the product has not undergone rigorous clinical tests , the sample size of 40 used to test it was too small and there was little evidence that it worked			1
@entity66 , from the @entity67 and @entity68 , said : ‘ in order to truly support the benefits of skincare products , manufacturers need to test the formulation on enough subjects to be statistically significant , i.e. hundreds			2
’ and skin expert @entity75 , from @entity76 , said : ‘ i think once again we are being seduced by a so - called “ miracle product ” that happens to have a great celebrity endorsement			0
’ but @entity16 yesterday insisted their products have undergone rigorous third party clinical testing on women between 35 and 60			0
a spokesman said : ‘ clinicians saw statistically significant improvement to the skin after two , six and 12 weeks			0
