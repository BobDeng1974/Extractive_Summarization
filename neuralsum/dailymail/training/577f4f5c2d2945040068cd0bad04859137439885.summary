@entity0 has become @entity2 's forgotten man in recent seasons but the @entity4 no 10 delivered a sweetly struck drop goal to snatch victory over @entity7 at the @entity8 yesterday			1
the @entity10 looked buried towards the end of a scrappy contest but , with the clock in red , @entity9 converted from 30 metres to secure his side 's second win in nine games			1
it prompted calls from director of rugby @entity20 for the 28 - year - old to be handed an international recall , having gone off the radar since emerging as the next big thing in 2007			2
@entity4 fought back to beat @entity7 28 - 26 in their @entity27 clash on sunday afternoon ' there are very few ball players who want to step up like that , ' said @entity20			1
' it shows the class of the player to get us home at the death			2
he 's definitely international class and i would n't swap him for another ball player in the league			2
' a lot of things came his way early and easily			0
he was a prodigious talent but he 's a better player now than when he got his chances for @entity2			0
if @entity0 was at a top - four club , everyone would be behind him			1
he has n't changed as a player but he 's matured a lot as a person			0
' @entity9 's last @entity51 was against @entity52 in 2009 , but the playmaker has not given up on his international ambitions			0
' i spoke to @entity56 ( @entity57 , the @entity2 coach ) before the autumn and he said to just keep playing well , ' said @entity9			0
' there are a lot of talented players in that 10 position , so i 'm not expecting a call - up any time soon in that regard			0
but i still think i can offer something at 12 or even off the bench			0
' the last minute drop goal from @entity0 sent @entity7 down to a fourth consecutive @entity27 defeat the visitors were outscored by four tries to two but the kicking of @entity71 kept the @entity72 in the hunt @entity4 have been unable to generate any momentum this season and @entity9 's late three points ended a losing streak at the @entity8 dating back to september			1
@entity7 , too , are woefully out of form			1
the opening quarter was littered with the sort of mistakes you expect from two struggling sides , with silly cross-field kicks and fluffed passes undoing any good work			0
promising @entity72 youngster @entity87 rattled the left upright with a fifth - minute penalty and it remained scoreless until the 20th minute , when @entity71 kicked the opening points			2
but the hosts hit back and , off a 12 - man driving maul , flanker @entity91 touched down			0
@entity7 's lineout struggled but the boot of @entity71 kept the scoreboard ticking , edging his side back in front			1
their opening try was as much down to @entity102 inaccuracies as it was to @entity7 precision , with @entity104 sloppily knocking on before lock @entity105 dived over			1
@entity4 's @entity106 goes over for a try during the @entity27 clash on sunday exiles flanker @entity109 dives over to score a try for the hosts at the @entity8 stadium having trailed at half - time , three tries in 12 second - half minutes from @entity109 , @entity104 and @entity114 secured the bonus point and put the hosts back ahead			1
@entity7 's response came through a close - range @entity119 try , but the reliable boot of @entity122 kept the @entity10 on course for a rare win			1
the @entity72 rallied with two penalties from @entity71 but , as @entity72 defenders charged towards him , up stepped @entity9 with the perfect kick			0
it leaves @entity7 in fifth position and director of rugby @entity128 admits his side need to snap back into life if they want to keep up their play - off challenge			2
' we 're going through that period where a win is proving tough to find , ' said @entity128			2
' it can be difficult to break the cycle			0
there will be some brutal honesty			0
' @entity105 celebrates after scoring for @entity7 at the @entity8 the @entity27 sides contest a line out during their match on sunday afternoon			1

@entity7 lost their fourth consecutive @entity27 match
the visitors looked in control but *capitulated* in the second half
@entity0 scored a last minute drop goal to steal the win
@entity7 were outscored by four tries to two
