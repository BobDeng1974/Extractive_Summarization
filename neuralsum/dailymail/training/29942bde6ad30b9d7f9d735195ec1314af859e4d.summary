the last time they were side by side was as babies in their mother ’s arms			2
but 78 years later , after being separated before they were 20 weeks old , long lost twin sisters named @entity8 and @entity9 have finally been reunited			1
they spent lifetimes apart in different countries ; one never knew she had a sister , the other never knew where her adopted twin might be			1
@entity18 sets eyes on her twin sister @entity20 for he first time in 78 yeras after they were separated as soon as the sisters saw each other they hugged , shedding tears of joy after finally being reunited this week they met for the first time – to discover striking parallels in the separate paths they followed			1
after hugging and shedding tears of joy , they caught up on old times in their first face - to - face conversation			2
their time apart is said to be the longest that twins have been separated , an unwitting achievement that will give experts extra insight into a fascinating phenomenon			2
despite growing up apart , carving out lives in different cultures and being separated by 5,000 miles , both married someone called @entity48 , found religion , became grandmothers , then widows			1
when they opened the family albums for each other they also discovered that each enjoys goofing about in front of the camera			2
when they ’re together , they share some of the same mannerisms			2
@entity9 , left and @entity8 , right both said ' how lovely ' as they reached out to one another despite growing up apart both married someone called @entity48 , found religion , became grandmothers , then widows they even chose the same words as they approached each other for the first time with arms outstretched : ‘ how lovely ! ’ they said , almost in unison			1
the poignant story began when the sisters were born @entity72 and @entity73 on february 28 , 1936 , in @entity74			0
their father was stationed at @entity77 barracks and had a fling with @entity79 , a domestic servant for a well - to - do family nearby			0
he never saw his daughters			0
@entity79 , who would almost certainly have been stigmatised for having children out of wedlock , and would probably have had to abandon her job to bring up two babies simultaneously , was forced to offer them for adoption			0
@entity73 was raised by @entity88 and @entity89 , a local family , who named her @entity90 @entity91 , left , was raised by her biological mother @entity93 but @entity8 , right was brougt up by adoptive parents @entity88 and @entity89 but @entity9 had curvature of the spine and was deemed unsuitable for adoption			1
so @entity93 kept her and called on friends and an aunt to help raise her			0
she was 15 before her mother told her she had a twin who was adopted , but she did n’t try to trace her sibling while her mother was alive			1
and when @entity79 died in 1980 , the adoption papers and other records had been lost			0
@entity9 moved to @entity106 , joined the @entity107 and married an @entity109 sailor			1
the couple settled in @entity111 , @entity112 , and raised two boys there			0
coincidentally , @entity8 discovered her past at almost the same time as @entity9			1
her aunt told her the @entity116 were not her natural parents and she immediately went home to ask her stepmother			0
she can not explain it now , but the way she phrased the question might have been significant			0
although she never knew she was a twin , she asked : ‘ were we adopted ? ’ she was happy to remain in @entity77 for the rest of her life , marrying , becoming a printer and raising three daughters			1
it was her daughter @entity129 , 43 , who discovered during some family tree research that mum appeared to have a sister			2
she traced her to @entity109 and after much research and several setbacks was able to tell her mother : ‘ she ’s your twin ! ’ they both married men called @entity48 , with @entity9 , left on her wedding day with her @entity109 sailor husband and @entity8 , right on hers an overjoyed @entity8 wrote to @entity9 at the address @entity129 had unearthed			1
@entity9 described the moment she saw the @entity77 postmark and read the letter			1
‘ my eyes popped out of my head , ’ she said			0
‘ i could n’t get on the phone fast enough to give her a call			0
‘ i had tried to trace her over the years but it seemed an impossible task			0
i had no idea where in the world she might be or even whether she was still alive			0
’ both women found out they had more in common than they thought			2
this is despite @entity9 , left , and @entity8 , right living on opposite sides of the @entity161 at the other end of the phone , @entity8 recalls : ‘ i was so excited i could hardly speak			1
i feel now i ’ve known her all my life			0
’ they finally met in person on thursday near @entity168 and quickly began to pore over photos in search of similarities			1
they do not believe they are identical twins but researchers will establish this through dna testing , before conducting extensive interviews with them			0
the research , by the @entity178 , will be used to look into ways of combating inherited disease and learning about the ageing process			0
meanwhile @entity9 ( she boasts she ’s 20 minutes older than her little sister ) was amazed that @entity8 had never left @entity77			1
so yesterday she was organising a reunion party back home in @entity112 – with her new - found sister as the star guest .			2

@entity20 and @entity189 were separated at 20 weeks old
@entity9 stayed with their mother while @entity8 was adopted
neither knew they had a twin sister until they were *teenagers*
finally found each other despite living on opposite sides of @entity161
were reunited this week at a meeting in @entity168
