interior designer @entity0 , 93 , is fast becoming one of the fashion industry 's most sought - after models , having just unveiled her second high - profile ad campaign in as many months			2
just weeks after featuring alongside teen blogger @entity5 in jeweler @entity7 's new campaign , mrs @entity0 has been revealed as the newest face of @entity12 's @entity11 collection , alongside @entity16 's @entity15 favorite @entity13 , 22			1
in the campaign , the duo are pictured cosying up to one another on a park bench , with mrs @entity0 modeling a pair of bold green trousers , blue polka - dot socks and a beautifully embellished beige coat , while miss @entity13 is wearing a simple white dress and wedges			2
the @entity43 fashion label also called on the talents of some slightly younger models too ; one of the most striking images from the campaign features miss @entity13 sitting on the bench reading a book , while two red - headed pre-teen twins cause havoc around her			0
@entity12 is the latest in a long line of high profile brands to defy society 's preconceived ideas about the fashion industry 's inherent ageism			0
in addition to mrs @entity0 's work with @entity7 , the last month has seen the likes of literary legend @entity62 , 80 , modeling for @entity63 and music icon @entity64 , 71 , posing up for @entity66 fashion house @entity65			1
something for everyone : the campaign also stars two red - headed pre-teen twins warm summer days : all of the images from @entity12 's new campaign are set on the same park bench rising star : just last month mrs @entity0 was unveiled as the face of jeweler @entity7 's @entity11 collection , alongside blogger @entity5 meanwhile , @entity77 enlisted three older women to help them showcase their @entity11 handbags and accessories , opting to avoid using professional models in favor of everyday people			1
when speaking about his decision to cast mrs @entity0 alongside blogger turned @entity85 , 18 , in his most recent campaign , jeweler @entity7 said that he did n't use the two women because of their ages , but because of their individuality and sense of independent style			1
' we 're selling to women who are predominantly over 35 , but we ’re showing them images of girls who are 19 and retouched , ' mr @entity7 told @entity96			0
' for the campaign , we honed in on the essence of strong women who have n’t conformed			0
' he added : ' @entity101 is so strong and so bright			0
@entity0 is kind of like a mother to me at this point and was probably a little bit annoyed that i never asked her to be in an ad [ before ]			2
