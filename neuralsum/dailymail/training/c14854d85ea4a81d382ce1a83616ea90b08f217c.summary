by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:35 est , 27 february 2014 plenty of cheeses get better with age , but crumbs discovered on the necks and chests of @entity10 mummies are now thought to be the world ’s oldest vintage - although their taste may be questionable			1
the cheese dates back to @entity15 and was essentially vacuum - packed with the bodies of the mysterious @entity18 people who were buried in the @entity19 , making it the oldest ever recovered			1
while the strange discovery was made in the 1930s , scientists have only just analysed the proteins and fats in the clumps of 3,600 - year - old food to reveal its age and ascertain that it is not butter or milk			1
some of the mummies ( pictured ) were found to have unusual crumbs on their necks and chest which are now known to ancient cheese			0
they were preserved - complete with their felt hats - die to the dry conditions of their desert burial two hundred mummies were discovered in the 1930s by @entity46 archaeologist in the @entity19 north of @entity47			1
@entity48 was rediscovered in 1934 by @entity46 archaeologist @entity49 and then lay forgotten until it was relocated using gps navigation by a @entity10 expedition			0
archaeologists began excavating it from 2003 to 2005			0
the people died around 3,600 years ago but their bodies were preserved because of the air - tight nature of their unusual graves and salty soil			2
the people had @entity61 features with light brown hair and have no name			0
they were buried in up - turned boats wrapped in animal skin to be air - tight on the top of sand dunes			0
the mummies are wearing felt caps with feathers , woollen capes and leather boots and were buried with precious objects including woven baskets , carved masks and a medicinal herb , as well as the cheese - which might have been intended for the afterlife			2
chemists at @entity81 's @entity80 found that the cheese is a lactose - free variety that was quick to make			1
it might have been responsible for spreading dairy farming across @entity86 in the @entity18 , the said			0
‘ we not only identified the product as the earliest known cheese , but we also have direct evidence of ancient technology , ’ analytical chemist and study author @entity88 told @entity89			0
the method of making the cheese was cheap and would have been used by common people , he said			0
the cheese survived because of the unusual conditions of @entity100 in the @entity101 in north western @entity10 – the final resting place of the mummies			1
they and the cheese were laid to rest on sand dunes near a river under large wooden boats wrapped so tightly in cow - hide that the bodies were essentially vacuum - packed			1
the mixture of dry desert air and salty soil preserved the mummies complete with their light brown hair , felt hats and woollen capes as well as delicate leather boots			0
some of the mummies were found to have unusual crumbs on their necks and chest , which are now known to be cheese and not butter or milk			0
two hundred mummies were discovered in the 1930s by a @entity46 archaeologist in the @entity19 north of @entity47			1
the site is known as @entity130 ( pictured ) it is not known why the people were buried with morsels of cheese on them , but much as other civilisations buried their dead with wine and bread , the mummy ’s ancestors might have provided them with cheese for the afterlife			0
analysis of the cheese shows that it was made by combining milk with a mixture of bacteria and yeast , similar to that used to make kefir , which is quite similar to cottage cheese , today			1
this is unusual as it is thought that people first stumbled across making cheese by carrying milk in bags made of animal guts , which contained rennet that curdled the milk			2
as the rennet method of making cheese requires the killing of an animal , dr @entity88 thinks the vegetarian kefir method proved easier and cheaper for people at the time			2
analysis of the ancient cheese shows that it was made by combining milk with a mixture of bacteria and yeast , similar to that used to make kefir ( pictured ) which is quite similar to cottage cheese , today the fact it was so easy and quick meant that it spread the practice of dairy farming across @entity86 from its origins in the @entity175 , according to the study , which will be published in the @entity177			1
fragments of cheese - making strainers in @entity182 , dating back more than 7,000 years , and 5,000 - year - old cheese making tools have previously been discovered in @entity184 , proving that our ancestors were partial to a morsel of cheese or two , bioarchaeologist @entity178 of the @entity179 told the publication			1
but no crumbs of ancient cheese as old as that found with the mummies have been recovered			0
dr @entity178 is however not convinced as to whether it is possible to confirm that the cheese was made like kefir as the proteins could have decayed too much to be absolutely sure .			2

mummies were discovered in the @entity19 , @entity10 in the 1930s
chemists at @entity81 's @entity80 analysed cheese to find it was made in a similar way to kefir
