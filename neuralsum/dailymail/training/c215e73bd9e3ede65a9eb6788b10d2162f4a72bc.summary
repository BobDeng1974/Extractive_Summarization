by @entity0 on 10 may 1814 - 200 years ago today - two boys made an escape attempt from their boarding school in @entity4			1
' @entity7 & @entity8 ran away at 4 o'clock this morning , ' one of their schoolmates confided to his diary , suitably impressed			1
' they put on the best clothes , borrowed some money and dropt from the window ... it was not till supper that @entity16 ( the schoolmaster0 was told that they had gone to @entity19 - there was a great jaw all day about it - they came back at bedtime			1
' a new exhibition at the @entity26 will showcase the inner thoughts of teenagers over the past 200 years the young diarist was 14 - year - old @entity30 , whose journal makes painful reading			1
his miscreant classmates were regularly beaten			1
1 june 1813 : ' @entity34 and @entity35 flogged , ' he noted for posterity			1
18 june : ' heard from @entity37			1
' @entity45 's diary , on loan from @entity43 's @entity42 archive , is the oldest in a new display of childhood and teenage diaries at the @entity50 , and some entries burn with a boyish sense of injustice			1
23 september : ' had a parcel & mr @entity56 made me open it before him and stole some of the things , ' he wrote indignantly			1
' so while he was reading the paper i tried to take it from him so he threatned [ sic ] to flog me			1
i mean to take things of his to make up for what he has stolen from me			1
' fortunately there were holidays to look forward to			1
arriving home in @entity70 from his school in @entity73 in july 1813 , young @entity45 found his family , ' all in a bustle packing for @entity76			1
' it was a scratchy homecoming though : ' did not get to sleep till near 4 in the morning on account of the fleas			1
' it took more than 25 hours travelling by sailing barge from @entity70 to @entity76 without any wind ... but then there were donkey rides , crabbing , the shock of seeing a man drowning and the thrill of seeing a shipwreck towed in			1
the new exhibition will explore the minds of teenagers across two centuries sadly , less than a year later @entity45 is sent home sick from school			1
24 may 1814 : ' took some rhubarb , castor oil and a saline draught for a head ake , ' he complains , before taking a dose of red medicine two days later			1
he does n't sound well ; the doctor comes to bleed him with six leeches			1
the final pages of the diary show traces of blood			1
@entity45 died not long after			2
' it 's not clear what he died of , but it 's a tragic end to a short life , ' says archivist @entity114			2
most of the diaries come from the @entity117 , which started from a collection of more than 1,500 rescued by historian @entity119 from house clearances , donations , on @entity122 or wherever they might turn up			2
in his day job at the @entity124 , he specialises in ancient @entity126 script			2
that explains @entity119 's fascination with a 1940s wartime diary partly written in code by an anonymous teenage girl , which surfaced at a car boot sale			1
' it 's very rare to find a normal diary written in code , ' he says			1
he was determined to crack it			1
' because i work with ancient scripts , i was n't going to let myself be beaten by a schoolgirl ! ' it appeared to be a simple substitution code , employing characters from other alphabets , including @entity145			2
' she must have got them from an encyclopaedia			2
you can see from the fluency that it was second nature - from which i deduced that she probably used the code with her friends			2
' he cracked the code with the word banana			2
' there are few words in @entity162 with that pattern			2
she used to go dancing with @entity165 who treated the girls to banana splits			2
' it seems she used the code to describe her glamorous mother 's activities as a prostitute			2
other teenage diaries capture that moment on the cusp of being a grown - up			0
@entity177 illustrated her diary in 1952 , when she was 14 , portraying herself as a @entity180 's schoolgirl with a hockey stick and a cigarette in a holder			0
she devoted a whole page to @entity186 's funeral , and that night went to see a film of the funeral procession			0
' it was terrific , but two and a half hours was quite enough ! my behind was quite sore , ' she said			0
timelessly , schoolgirl diaries record innocent crushes on oblivious boys			0
in 1937 , @entity196 from @entity197 , who started her diary when she was almost 15 , obsessed over every fleeting glimpse of a boy who wore glasses			0
8 november : ' " there are few words in @entity162 with that pattern			0
she used to go dancing with @entity165 who treated the girls to banana splits			0
" it seems she used the code to describe her glamorous mother 's activities as a prostitute ' ' @entity212			0
i do like him , yet i do n't know if he likes me			0
' and the following day , segueing seamlessly from puppy love to domestic science : ' passing my darling @entity218 - i came late with a saddlebag bulging , a music case on my handlebars and a satchel on my back ... in cookery we did the @entity227 stew , which came out like water , plus water , mixed with water ... miss @entity231 actually thought that @entity233 and i were going to eat it too			0
' one of the @entity117 researchers is @entity236 , and her own grandmother @entity238 's diary makes up part of the archive			0
at 12 , @entity238 was expelled from boarding school for reading @entity242			0
by 1947 , as a man - mad 17 - year - old living in @entity246 , her diary included sketches of her new wedge sandals and ' sensational ' new platform shoes			0
a diary entry for april that year describes a flirtation with a @entity252 returned from the war			0
' @entity254 was affectionate to put it mildly - he says he 's 36 and also has decided to remain a lone wolf for good , that is unless i decide to marry him - is this a proposal ? perhaps - anyway he thinks i 'm beautiful which is something			0
' she seems to have had a racy time on a holiday in @entity266 the following month			0
' @entity267 , i think , is slightly in love with me , or of course it may just be @entity227 blarney ... as a rule , i do n't like being kissed but @entity273 's kisses were very pleasant ... i left him feeling utterly knocked over			0
he is of course quite the most unsuitable person i could find ... ' he certainly was , as he had @entity276 and she had only met him that morning			0
even the most mundane diaries are a resource for historians of the future , says @entity119			0
' when i was a child , a new diary was a standard @entity283 present			0
they belong to a handwritten world that is vanishing			0
most of us think our own lives are uninteresting to anyone else , but imagine if we had hundreds of diaries from @entity294 's time today ! ' the @entity117 , @entity50 , from 17 may			0

a new @entity26 exhibition will showcase 200 years of journals
the exhibit will crack the codes and secret *messages* written in them
the exhibition opens on 17th may at the @entity26
