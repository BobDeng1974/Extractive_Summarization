by @entity0 a new study has found women who drink three sugary drinks a week increase their risk of suffering breast cancer women who have more than three sugary drinks a week may have an increased risk of developing breast cancer , a study has found			1
researchers found that the more sugary drinks consumed by the women in their study , the greater the density of their breasts - a known risk factor for cancer			1
dense breasts have less fatty tissue and more of the gland tissue that makes and drains milk as well as supportive tissue that surrounds the gland			1
women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous			1
their cancers are also more likely to be missed because any areas of abnormal tissue are harder to spot during mammogram screening			1
lead author of the study , dr @entity33 from @entity34 in @entity35 , said : ‘ we know that worldwide consumption of sugar has increased and the findings of this study show what effect that type of diet could have on breast density , one of the strongest indicators for breast cancer risk			1
’ for the study , 1,555 women - half of whom were pre-menopausal and half of whom were postmenopausal - answered a questionnaire about how often they drank sugar - sweetened fruit juice and fizzy drinks			2
a serving was 355ml , about the size of a normal can of fizzy drink			0
their breast density was then measured through mammogram screening			1
dr @entity33 said : ‘ among all women , those who had a sugary drink intake of more than three servings per week had a mean of 29.6 per cent in breast density but those who did not drink this type of drink had a mean of 26.2 per cent in breast density			1
‘ an increase of about three per cent in breast density is not negligible in terms of breast cancer risk			2
‘ by comparison it has been shown that healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer who received ( the breast cancer drug ) tamoxifen for four - and - a - half years had a reduction of 6.4 per cent in breast density , and it has been observed that tamoxifen can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 30 - 50 per cent in high - risk women			1
’ experts believe sugar can enhance cell growth , and therefore the density of breast tissue			1
women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous it ’s thought that sugar can enhance cell growth , and therefore , density in breast tissue			1
dr @entity33 concluded : ‘ considering the worldwide increase in sugar consumption and all the health problems it is related to , it is important to continue research on this subject and begin to inform the public about the adverse effects of sugar consumption			0
’ the study was published in the journal @entity121			0
a new piece of research at the @entity124 has found @entity126 drugs do not cause breast or gynecological cancers fertility drugs do not trigger cancer in women trying to get pregnant , says new research			1
a @entity134 study of almost 10,000 women suggests hormonal drugs and other medication do not raise the overall risk of breast , ovarian and womb cancers			2
the exception is women who remained childless despite having drugs called gonadotrophins as part of @entity126 treatment			2
but experts believe the extra risk is caused by underlying health problems responsible for the infertility			0
debate has raged about whether @entity126 drugs may cause cancer because they stimulate hormones linked to the disease , especially breast cancer			0
a new study looked back at 9,892 women treated for infertility between 1965 and 1988 at five @entity134 centres , and followed them for 30 years for data on cancer			0
altogether 749 breast cancers , 119 womb cancers and 85 ovarian cancers were found			2
using a popular fertility drug called clomiphene was not linked with breast , womb or ovarian cancers			0
a small number of women treated with the drug for at least a year had a 69 per cent higher risk of breast cancer , but only 31 women fell into this category			2
experts said current guidelines recommended just three to six months of treatment			0
dr @entity181 from the @entity124 , @entity182 , presented the data today at the @entity184 of the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) in @entity186			0
he said the results were ‘ generally reassuring ’			0
there was a higher cancer risk for women treated with newer fertility hormones known as gonadotrophins who remained childless			0
but , said dr @entity181 , only 13 women were in this category and it was likely the increased risk was caused by their severe infertility ‘ rather than that of drug usage			0
’ @entity202 general secretary of the @entity204 , said ‘ cancer risks of drugs used to stimulate egg production have been evaluated in a number of national studies and not found to significantly increase the risk , other than that which relates to the underlying risks in this patient group			2
‘ this study does not change the current recommendation to patients that the risks are low but that clomiphene should generally not be used for more than 12 cycles			0
’ the study based on 30 years of research found ' little evidence ' women treated using conventional fertility hormones for ovarian stimulation increased the long - term risk of breast and gynecological cancers			1

researchers at @entity34 in @entity35 found the more sugary drinks women consumed the greater the density of their breasts
@entity238 is thought to enhance cell growth therefore increasing breast density
dense breasts have less fatty tissue and more gland tissue increasing the number of cells that have the potential to become cancerous
study found cancers are more likely to be missed because abnormal tissue is then harder to spot on a mammogram
separate study found *ivf* drugs do *n't* cause breast or gynecological cancers
