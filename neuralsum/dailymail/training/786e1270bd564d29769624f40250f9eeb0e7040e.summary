by @entity0 the commercial production of eggs for fast growing @entity4 salmon has been given approval in a crucial step to bringing ‘ frankenfish ’ to the world ’s kitchens			1
the salmon have been genetically modified to include genes from the eel - like @entity13 pout and @entity15 salmon , which means they grow more quickly than their wild or farmed equivalent			1
the @entity20 authorities are in the final stages of an approval process to allow the first genetically modified animals for human consumption			2
the @entity4 salmon have been genetically modified to include genes from the eel - like @entity13 pout and @entity27 ( pictured ) , which means they grow more quickly than their wild or farmed equivalent while salmon are the first @entity4 fish soon to be approved , plans are also in place to create fast - growing trout and tilapia			1
biotech companies believe there are huge riches to be had from tapping into the fast growing fish farming industry , which is said to be worth $ 100 billion a year			2
typically the @entity4 salmon grow to be around 24 inches long and a market weight of 3kg in 18 months rather than three years for farmed @entity42 salmon			1
some of the salmon , which have been developed by the company @entity44 , have been grown to reach 11lb ( 5kg )			0
the addition of genes from the ocean pout and the chinook salmon triggers the release of growth hormone and encourages them to eat and grow all year round , rather than just the spring and summer			2
the net effect is that fish farming companies can harvest the fish much more often , so boosting production and profits			0
@entity57 is based in @entity58 , however it is listed on the @entity59 where it is keen to enlist investors			0
today , the company said it was received clearance from the @entity64 to produce eggs on a commercial scale at its facility in @entity68 , @entity58			0
critics fear the @entity4 salmon will escape into the wild			1
it is suggested they might interbreed with wild fish or effectively kill off wild populations because they will consume all the available food			1
today , @entity44 said it has received clearance from the @entity64 to produce eggs on a commercial scale at its facility in @entity68 , @entity58			0
@entity80 eggs at a fish hatchery are pictured however , @entity44 insists there are a number of key safeguards that will stop this from happening			0
initially at least , the eggs will be shipped to a land - locked fish farm in western @entity88 , where they will be grown to market size in vast metal tanks , away from rivers and the sea			2
the salmon would be frozen and shipped to the @entity20 and around the world			0
in future , fish farm tanks would be established across the globe to meet growing demand for what is considered a healthy fish variety			0
all the @entity4 salmon are designed to be female and sterile , which should , in theory , prevent any risk of interbreeding			1
the approval for commercial production of the @entity4 salmon eggs was granted following a risk assessment conducted by @entity110 , which involved independent scientists and the government agency , @entity112			1
this study concluded @entity118 ’s salmon ‘ is not harmful to the environment or human health when produced in contained facilities ’			0
a company spokesman said : ‘ while @entity44 ’s eggs and fish will not be available for sale until they are approved by the relevant national regulatory bodies , this is a significant milestone towards commercial production			0
’ campaigning groups in the @entity129 and overseas have raised significant questions about the ethics and safety of producing @entity4 fish for human consumption			1
they claim the fish farm in @entity88 has been built without all the necessary inspections and permits to ensure the site is secure and safe			0
biotech companies believe there are huge riches to be had from tapping into the fast growing fish farming industry , which is said to be worth $ 100 billion a year dr @entity144 of @entity145 @entity129 said : ‘ it is shocking that commercial production of @entity4 salmon could be authorised in future in facilities which fail to meet environmental standards			1
’ @entity145 claims the @entity153 food watchdog , the @entity154 , has not put in sufficient safeguards to ensure @entity4 fish can not come in to member states without proper checks on their safety			1
it is also a grey area as to whether @entity4 fish imported from @entity88 or other parts of the world would have to be labelled to ensure consumers know what they are eating			1
@entity129 consumers have made clear in surveys that labelling is a minimum requirement , however the record of the @entity129 government has been to oppose putting such information on packs			0
the @entity174 condemned the approval for commercial production of @entity4 salmon eggs			2
spokesman @entity178 said : ‘ we are extremely disappointed and alarmed that our government has approved the production of @entity4 fish eggs			1
@entity4 salmon egg production in @entity58 endangers the future of wild @entity42 salmon around the world			1
‘ it ’s simply crazy that the world ’s first @entity4 fish eggs are now going to be coming from @entity58			2
’ ‘ it ’s unacceptable that this incredibly important decision was made in total secrecy and without any public consultation			0
’ the @entity4 fish egg production is opposed by the @entity68 group called @entity68 say no to @entity196			2
spokesman , @entity197 , said : ‘ we ’re devastated that @entity68 is now officially the home of the @entity196			0
we do n’t want our @entity68 to be the source of this dangerous living pollution			0

the salmon have been genetically modified to include genes from @entity15 salmon , which means they grow faster than their wild or farmed equivalent
critics fear the @entity4 salmon will escape into the wild and effectively kill off wild populations because they will consume all the available food
