they are furious at a proposal to ban motorcycles made before 2000 from the city 's streets , a move the municipal government insists will lessen @entity3 's stifling air pollution			1
the @entity14 @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , one of @entity14 's largest and most active motorcyclist rights lobby groups , organised today 's protest against the ban			0
defending motorcycles , the @entity57 said in a statement that ' because of their low fuel consumption , reduced size , mobility and shorter journey times , they are a solution to the congestion of urban traffic and of value in the fight against pollution			0
' while other @entity77 cities have , quite logically , not included motorised two wheelers in this restriction , the city of @entity3 still wants to penalise users whose negative impact in terms of pollution is marginal			2
