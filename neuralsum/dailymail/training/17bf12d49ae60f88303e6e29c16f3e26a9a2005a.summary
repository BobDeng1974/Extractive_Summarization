every morning , i wake up and ' put on my face ' , as my mother used to call it			2
i even out my freckly skin with foundation , bring my cheeks to life with blusher , and give my blonde eyelashes definition with lots of mascara			2
on a good day , i 'll take a stab at eyeliner and eyeshadow			2
but to be honest i 'm not sure why i bother			2
within hours of applying make - up , i am a smudgy mess			1
i have very oily , sweaty skin , so nothing sticks , despite applying loose and pressed powder throughout the day			0
i 'm often tempted not to bother at all			0
but now , apparently , there is an answer			0
when @entity31 launched its @entity32 a few weeks ago , nearly 12,000 women clamoured to get on the waiting list			1
the reason ? it claims to use space - age technology that makes it last for 24 hours			1
the high - tech base contains lipophilic acid , which is so absorbent it 's used by @entity39 to ' soak up ' space dust so that it does n't affect the outer casings of a rocket			1
the same substance also , apparently , sucks grease from the face , helping make - up last much longer			1
and @entity31 is n't the only one - look in @entity48 ' make - up aisle and you 'll find 24 - hour lipsticks , mascaras and eyeshadows from a multitude of cheap and cheerful brands			1
but do any of them actually stay put for an entire day and night ? i put some to the test ... 6am out of the world : @entity59 's @entity32 has ingredients used by @entity39 i 've never applied so much make - up this early			1
as well as the space - age ingredients , @entity31 's @entity32 ( boots , £ 30.50 ) contains a ' hydrophilic agent ' - a clay - like mix of minerals that the company claim acts like ' an invisible sponge ' , soaking up moisture from the face			1
it 's surprisingly thin and watery , compared with my usual , creamy foundation , and sinks straight in , leaving a chalky finish			1
i top it up with @entity77 24 - hour waterproof powder ( £ 6.99 ) , which promises ' flawless coverage and shine control all day long '			1
@entity77 's @entity81 ( £ 4.99 , @entity48 ) claims ' up to 24 hours staying - power ' and ' innovative pigment technology for a super-saturated colour '			1
the little pots of gel cream shadow can be applied with fingers or a brush			0
i use a bronze base with a smokey silver on top			0
the soft colours go on easily and feel like they 're going to stay put			0
this is topped off with @entity97 eyes 24 - hour gel eyeliner ( £ 6.99 , @entity48 ) , which promises ' up to 24 hours of rich , intense colour that does n't flake , smudge , smear or run ' , and lashings of @entity103 's @entity102 ( £ 18 )			1
the mascara wand is tiny , so you have to layer it up , but it vows to ' look pretty for 24 hours without a smudge or smear			1
lasts through rain , sweat , humidity , tears ’			0
what more could a girl want ? well , rosy cheeks and a perfect pout , of course ! @entity97 's @entity118 is a cream blusher , claiming to ' create a long - lasting , natural - looking flush of colour that lasts up to 24 hours ' ( £ 4.49 , @entity122 )			1
it has a much denser colour than i ’m used to , and feels sticky , but it blends in quite well and the colour is pretty			0
i 'm a disaster with lipstick , so i usually just go for lipgloss			0
but @entity132 ( boots , £ 10.99 ) sounds perfect			0
it consists of a lip stain , applied once , and a waxy lip balm , applied throughout the day to keep lips moist			0
the stain goes on easily , and the colour is strong			0
but my lips feel dry - you need the balm on top			2
an hour later , i 'm ready to go			0
12pm the powder seems to have fallen at the first post			0
it really did n't last long - no more than an hour			2
the foundation seems to be staying put , but , because the powder 's given up , i 'm now very shiny			1
the lip colour has done surprisingly well , although it 's gone from hot to lukewarm pink			2
my cheeks have faded in colour , but the eye make - up is immaculate			2
the liner , mascara and eyeshadow are exactly the same as when i applied them this morning			0
no need to reapply : @entity132 claims to last 24 hours 6pm the shine continues ! i feel like there 's an oil slick starting in my t - zone and spreading across my face			1
the cheek colour has gone			0
the pink of my lips is coming away in patches , but it 's largely still there			2
and though the foundation is very thin , i can feel it sitting on my skin ; i feel like my skin ca n't breathe			0
the eyes , however , are a miracle ! the liner on the bottom lashline has smudged slightly , but the top is immaculate , and there is no creasing with the eye colour			0
midnight it 's the end of a long day			2
the eyeliner has smudged more below my eyes and my eyeshadow is vanishing			0
after dinner and drinks , my lip colour is barely there - and brushing my teeth does n't help			2
i really want to wash my face , too , but i do n't			0
instead , i go to bed with my space - age foundation and smokey eyes , and worry what the state of my pillows - and my pores - will be in the morning			1
i get spots easily if i do n't keep my skin very clean , so i 'm sure i 'll wake up with breakouts			0
7am oh dear ! nobody needs to wake up to this vision in the mirror			0
i have big smudges under my eyes and the remaining eye colour seems to have gathered in clumps			0
there is one , lone , pink dot on my lips			0
but the mascara is immaculate - it has n't smudged or broken off , and my lashes are perfectly curly			2
i can still feel the foundation on my skin which , i suppose , is the aim , but i ca n't wait to get it off			0
i run to the shower and use my most industrial - strength scrub			2
verdict @entity220 marks : @entity21 was the most impressed with the @entity77 eyeshadow and @entity103 mascara foundation claim : 24 hours reality : 24 hours because the foundation is light and natural - looking , it 's hard to tell if it stayed for 24 hours - i think it did			1
however , the product promises ' 24 hours of soft - matte perfection ' , which was not the case for me in terms of shine			1
powder claim : 24 hours reality : 1 hour very disappointing - within an hour of doing errands on a sunny day , my skin was very shiny			1
eyeliner claim : 24 hours reality : 16 hours it began to smudge underneath by the end of the day , but the top line stayed perfect for 24 hours			1
eyeshadow claim : 24 hours reality : 20 hours the colour started to come off by the end of the day , but there was some left on my lids after 24 hours - it was just clumpy			1
@entity247 claim : 24 hours reality : 24 hours it did not budge			1
my lashes stayed perfectly curly			0
blusher claim : 24 hours reality : 7 hours very disappointing - the colour faded quickly and vanished by the late afternoon			1
lips claim : 24 hours reality : 15 hours i kept a fairly strong colour for most of the day - much more than with a normal lipstick - but this could n't survive dinner and teeth - brushing .			1

@entity31 's @entity32 claims to use space - age technology
they say it should last for 24 hours
cheaper brands also claim to have staying power
so do they really work ?
