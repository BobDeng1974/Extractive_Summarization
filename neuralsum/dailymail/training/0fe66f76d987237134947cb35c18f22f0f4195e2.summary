it 's rare that your @entity2 's actual speed lives up to the number on your router 's box - but that could be about to change if @entity7 has its way			1
the @entity10 company has developed a 60 ghz wifi technology that it claims can send data five times faster than other electronics devices			1
this will allow data transmission speeds of up to 575 megabytes ( @entity17 ) per second – enough to transfer a @entity19 movie between devices in less than three seconds			0
this will allow data transmission speeds of up to 575 megabytes ( @entity17 ) per second – enough to transfer a @entity19 movie between devices in less than three seconds it also means that an uncompressed high - definition videos can be streamed from mobile devices to a television in real - time			1
' unlike the existing @entity32 and 5 ghz @entity2 technologies , @entity7 's 802.11ad standard 60 ghz @entity2 technology maintains maximum speed by eliminating co-channel interference , regardless of the number of devices using the same network , ' according to @entity7 's announcement			2
the group says previous attempts to use the @entity44 band for @entity2 have failed because they used millimetre waves that travel by line - of - sight			1
they have weak penetration properties , which means they often lose signal and data performance when they hit obstacles such as walls			0
using something known as a ' wide - coverage beam - forming antennae ' , @entity7 says it has solved the speed issues that come with millimetre waves			1
@entity7 has revealed it has been working on a consumer virtual realtiy headset @entity7 is working with virtual reality firm , @entity61 , to develop a consumer vr headset			2
called the @entity64 , users slip a note 3 tablet into the headset to provide the screen			0
the firm says it will start selling the headset to ' innovators ' this year			0
' powered by @entity72 technology , the @entity64 delivers a completely new way to experience and consume mobile content , ' @entity7 said			1
it is believed @entity7 provided the hardware , while @entity72 provided the software			2
it 's consumer headset , called the rift , is not expected to go on sale to the public until next year			0
the firm has also partnered with several game development firms to develop content for the gadget			0
the headset , in development under the name ' @entity89 ' , is designed toproject images that shift along with the movements of a gamer'shead			0
the group hopes to commercialise its 60 ghz wifi technology as early as next year , in audio - visual systems , medical devices and mobile phones			1
the technology is also likely to be key to the ' @entity99 ' - a vision of living in which home appliances are connected to the internet and controlled remotely			2
last week , @entity7 said its quarterly operating profit had fallen 60 per cent because of poor smartphone sales			0
it also announced a 15.6 trillion won ( $ 14.5 billion or £ 9 billion ) investment to build a plant in @entity10 that would produce semiconductor chips			0
@entity7 hopes to commercialise its 60 ghz wifi technology as early as next year , in audio - visual systems , medical devices and mobile phones			1

this will allow *hd* video to be streamed from mobile to tv in real - time
early attempts to use @entity44 band failed as they used millimetre waves
these waves travel by line - of - sight and have trouble penetrating walls
@entity7 *overcame* this using ' wide - coverage beam - forming antennae '
the south @entity10 group said its technology will be available next year
