@entity0 , the genial quinquagenarian who quotes @entity1 in press conferences , has a calm demeanour which is rubbing off on the @entity4			1
previously an ill - disciplined bunch seemingly capable of spectacular implosions , the @entity4 lead the @entity7 and ooze confidence on and off the field			1
@entity10 and penalties are down , and while they previously relied upon their offense to win games , it is when they do not have the ball that they are the most dangerous			2
@entity19 has a fully functioning defense at his disposal			1
it features a fearsome front four , a linebacker capable of dominating the run in @entity25 , while @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 have made a mockery of pre-season fears about the secondary			2
@entity0 's reign has started in favourable fashion with the perennial underachievers looking to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2011 in the past , the @entity4 have struggled to overcome injuries			1
and there have been some bizarre ones this season			2
linebacker @entity40 is out for the season after tearing his acl celebrating a sack on @entity44			2
he played the previous 131 games			0
meanwhile , tight end @entity46 is still sidelined after injuring his ankle while trying to stop his dog urinating in his house			0
and that 's without mention of @entity52			1
the @entity4 have recorded back - to - back wins as the @entity55 receiver struggles with an ankle injury			1
@entity52 returned to practice on wednesday but @entity0 's next man up policy seems to be creating a different breed of @entity4			1
sunday saw a remarkable 13 - point comeback in the final four minutes to win against the @entity62			2
the gutsy win was exactly the sort of perfomance which would have eluded combustible former coach @entity66			2
and while @entity66 , now @entity68 's defensive co-ordinator , temporarily got one over his old team with his bizarre post-game celebration in week five , the @entity4 are a @entity71 win away from going 6 - 2 into the bye			1
the team have sung @entity0 's praises all season			1
from president @entity77 to media personnel , no - one has a bad word to say about him			2
they say his calm nature and logical methods have spread through the organisation			0
' he ’s exactly what i hoped and expected he would be during the interview process , if not better , ' @entity77 said ahead of the @entity4 ' first practice session on @entity89 soil			1
asked to summarise success this season , defensive end @entity90 added : ' maybe it was just the change with the coaching staff			0
coach @entity0 has brought in a different message over to us			1
he treats us like men and professionals			0
that ’s how we ’ll carry our business			0
' @entity0 commands and emits respect			1
when he talks , people listen			0
and when he divulged the secrets to his leadership , the answer was typically straightforward			0
' i simply treat them as men , hold them accountable for what they do and try to take care of them			0
' i know at one point in time i was reading an old military magazine or one of the military manuals that @entity1 had put together and in it , one of the things he said was : " take care of your men "			0
and that stuck out to me			0
@entity123 , a free agency acquisition , has shown the @entity4 that they can cope without @entity52 ' even as a young coach , i was probably in my twenties at that time and i wrote it down and i felt that was something that was extremely important because i could sense it and see why it was important in the profession in the profession of which i was in			1
' and i ’ve always felt that to be the case , that you have to try to give them the best opportunity to be the absolute best they can			0
so , it ’s our duty to have empathy along with expertise and i think that ’s really what coaching is all about			0
and i think that ’s probably what they ’re responding to , but it ’s really more about them than me			0
' a typically modest response from the man who may just be turning the tide in @entity4 .			1

the @entity4 are *historically* a *tortured* *franchise* with an *uncanny* *ability* to shoot themselves in the foot
they have not appeared in the playoffs since 2011
but @entity4 lead the @entity7 and will go 6 - 2 with *victory* over the @entity162
*59* - year - old coach @entity0 is working *wonders* since taking over in *january*
with the @entity168 's no 1 - *ranked* defense the @entity4 have won their last two without the injured @entity52
