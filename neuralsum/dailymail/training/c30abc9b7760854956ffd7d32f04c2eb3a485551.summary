@entity1 is stepping down as @entity2 over ' strain ' on his family life , he announced today			1
but the decision to leave the @entity9 administration came weeks ago , multiple sources including one in the @entity6 told @entity10			1
' he first started talking about it in late april , ' the @entity2 insider said friday after the decision was made final			1
' but the president had the prerogative to pull the trigger when he decided to			0
' that time ended up being friday , just hours after @entity18 secretary @entity17 resigned amid a major scandal involving faked wait - lists and denied medical care in the @entity18 health system			1
' to be honest , the move was more about how to deflect attention away from @entity17 's resignation , and less about giving @entity1 a thoughtful send - off , ' the @entity2 official said			1
' there ’s no scandal , ' the source said			0
' he wanted to go for a while			0
' the insider also confirmed that he wants to spend the summer months with his wife , @entity52 reporter @entity51 , and their children – and that he is exhausted			0
the source added that @entity1 is confident he 'll be offered work as a tv pundit and cash in financially			2
president @entity9 spoke directly to the @entity2 press corps on friday afternoon – his second hastily called appearance in a single day – to announce that @entity1 would be replaced by his deputy , @entity32			1
he confirmed that @entity1 has first approached him a month ago about taking another job			2
' in april , @entity1 came to me in the @entity65 and said that he was thinking of moving on , and i was not thrilled , to say the least , ' @entity9 said			1
' but @entity1 has had to wrestle with this decision for quite some time			1
' split personality : @entity1 played the role of passive boy scout in the briefing room , but showed an aggressive and sometimes vulgar exterior when challenged happy couple : @entity1 will be able to spend more time with his wife , @entity52 journalist @entity51 , and their two children @entity1 is a former @entity77 bureau chief for @entity78 and has held the position at the @entity2 since february 2011			1
he was previously vice president @entity40 's press secretary			2
he gushed for reporters that his job has ' been an amazing experience – just , so fulfilling			0
' rumors had swirled around the @entity2 that @entity1 was angling for a posting as the @entity86 ambassador to @entity87 , but the former @entity89 bureau chief for @entity90 said it was n't in the cards since his family had only just now ' won me back			2
' @entity1 has not enjoyed a rosy relationship with @entity2 correspondents , often parrying accusations that he has made the @entity6 far less accessible to journalists than it had been under previous presidents			1
his alternatively glib and cheerful exterior at the briefing podium often gave way to more forceful , sometimes vulgar exchanges with reporters when open - press events spiraled out of control			2
in one case , when a reporter with the center - right @entity107 asked a question out of turn during a 2011 @entity112 press conference and sparred with @entity9 over immigration policy , @entity1 called the news outlet 's executive editor – this reporter – and cursed a blue streak , threatening to cancel the reporter 's press credentials			1
@entity9 seemed to paper over such outbursts on friday , saying that @entity1 ' has good judgment			1
he has good temperament and he has good heart			0
' ' be nice to him on his farewell tour , ' the president joked			0
@entity126 : @entity32 ( @entity127 ) will take over as @entity2 press secretary , giving correspondents a new daily whipping boy @entity131 : @entity1 was known for referring often to a briefing binder full of talking points , rather than addressing many tough questions off - the - cuff the cover of the spring 2014 issue of ' @entity138 ' magazine featured @entity51 and the two @entity1 children xxxxxxxx @entity32 , 39 , has been the go - to replacement for @entity1 on @entity141 and in the press briefing room when his boss was away			1
but reporters have not yet tested his day - to - day mettle			0
' today the flak jacket is officially passed to a new generation , ' @entity9 said			0
this is n't the first such transition in the @entity6			0
@entity9 ’s first presidential press secretary , @entity150 , moved on to found his own strategic communications firm , @entity151			2
he also has a contract as an on - air commentator at the liberal cable news network @entity154			0
@entity1 , 49 , said he wo n't step down right away but will continue to brief reporters until he decides what to do next			0
' i have n't made any decisions yet , ' he said			0
' i 'm excited by some of the possibilities			0
i 'm sure you guys will be among the first to know after i 've decided what to do			0
' the outgoing press flack often made reporters cringe by deflecting tough questions to @entity9 administration cabinet departments			2
@entity168 assembled a clip reel of examples on friday , showing his go - to line when he did n't have answers			0
his clashes with the press were the stuff of legend , including he full - throated defense of shifting @entity2 policy that saw news photographers excluded from many – if not most – of @entity9 's daily calendared events			1
that change brought condemnation from the powerful @entity185 , and from some newspapers – chief among them @entity187 – that said they would no longer publish the posed and manicured ' official ' @entity2 photographs that the administration habitually distributed instead			0
it was the president 's trip to @entity193 for @entity195 's memorial service that proved to be the final straw , with @entity198 reporter @entity197 accusing the @entity9 @entity2 of operating by a different standard of openness			1
' i mean , anyone here can tell that there 's less access than under the @entity208 administration , ' she said durign a december 12 , 2013 briefing , and yet ... it was president @entity9 who talked about transparency being a hallmark of his administration			1
' ' so is n't it sort of the problem is that he has set up a standard himself that he 's not meeting , that his @entity2 is not meeting ? ' @entity219 spilled the beans after @entity221 had a secret lunch thursday with @entity9 in the @entity2 , and reporters were steamed to have been left out of the loop on thursday @entity1 faced reporters ' anger after news emerged from people magazine that former secretary of state and likely 2016 presidential candidate @entity221 had a secret lunch with the president , an event that was omitted from the daily calendar distributed to reporters			1
ultimately , @entity1 offered a time - worn explanation for his retreat from government service , saying he wanted to spend more time with his wife and their young children			2
' they are never the age they are today again , ' he said wistfully .			0

@entity1 will be replaced by his deputy @entity32
