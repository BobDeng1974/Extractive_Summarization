@entity0 were beaten 31 - 28 by @entity1 on saturday , extending their winless run against the @entity1 to 12 games			1
here , @entity4 looks at five things we learned from @entity7			1
@entity1 celebrate the only try of the first half during their 31 - 28 victory over @entity0 on saturday too many unforced errors - @entity0 must make most of pressure it 's an all - too - familiar story for @entity0 fans , but again the hosts at @entity7 dominated possession and had the majority of the territory against the @entity1			1
but fumbled balls , especially in the first - half , cost @entity23 's side time and time again			1
@entity24 would have capitalised more than @entity1 too , which is a worrying thought			2
@entity0 made too many mistakes against @entity1 and were punished for not converting chances time for @entity28 @entity0 's kicking let them down again on saturday , and although you can never doubt @entity32 's goal - kicking , it is perhaps time for @entity35 to enter the fray permanently			1
the 21 - year - old can control the tempo and has the creativity to unlock defences , even though he may not have quite proved it in his brief substitute appearance			0
@entity32 's place - kicking is exemplary but his place in the side is coming under threat @entity1 hoodoo the @entity1 are the second best side in the world , undoubtedly , but 12 games without a win against them is turning into an @entity0 hoodoo			1
unlike the hosts , @entity1 were clinical when they entered the opposition 's 22 , and were in fact only really troubled when they were a man down in the second - half			2
@entity58 runs away for his try as the @entity1 made it 12 on the bounce against @entity0 changes for @entity62 three - point defeats may sound like they are narrow , but the visitors were much better than @entity0 on saturday			2
it was a similar story against @entity24 , and @entity66 surely must look to freshen things up against @entity62			0
@entity68 and @entity69 could be options , with the @entity72 half - back impressing after replacing @entity73			0
@entity69 impressed at scrum half when he replaced @entity73 and could start against @entity62 unfortunate debut for @entity76 the young winger could n't quite show fans what he was about at @entity7			0
this was n't helped by some lazy decision - making from @entity32 early on , who flicked an inside ball towards the younster by his own corner with two @entity87 defenders closing in			0
with the vast amount of options to return after this series , @entity76 may have to wait for his next big chance on the international stage			0
@entity76 was unfortunate on his full debut for @entity0 and may have to wait for another chance			0

@entity0 lost 31 - 28 to @entity1 at @entity7 on saturday
it is the 12th test in a row in which they have lost to the @entity1
