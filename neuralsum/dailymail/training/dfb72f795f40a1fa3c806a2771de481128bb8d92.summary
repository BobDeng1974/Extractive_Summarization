by @entity0 his remains have come to symbolise the nation 's million dead from the @entity4			0
but exactly how the @entity5 - who rests in @entity6 - was chosen has remained something of a mystery since the unidentified body was brought home from @entity11 in 1920			1
now , an astonishing document that explains how the body was selected has been revealed by the grandson of @entity16 chaplain @entity15 , who helped organise the bringing home of the corpse			1
famous : the grave of the @entity5 is pictured ( left ) after the @entity22 service at @entity6 on november 11 , 2009 , and ( right ) at the funeral procession in @entity24 in 1920 almost a century ago : the funeral of the @entity5 in 1920			1
the gun carriage bearing the @entity5 's coffin is halted beside the @entity28 for the unveiling ceremony @entity30 said : ' my grandfather selected six corpses without identification marks			1
he made sure all the coffins looked exactly the same and that there was no evidence of where the bodies came from			1
' the 46 - year - old charity adviser told the @entity41 that when he found the story in a box left by his grandfather , he realised : ‘ this is a very significant part of @entity47 history			0
’ @entity48 typewrote a document about the selection process , which he did not want revealed until after his death , and it will feature tonight on the @entity54 programme @entity52			2
according to the @entity41 , it says : ‘ six bodies were taken to the headquarters at @entity58 , near @entity59			0
those who awaited the bodies did not know from where they had come			0
over the years : the scene at the grave of the @entity5 after the silence with the @entity67 conducting the service , in 1939 paying his respects : @entity72 president @entity71 lays a wreath at the tomb of the @entity5 in 2011 ‘ the six coffins were placed in a hut and each was covered with a @entity78			2
all night they rested on trestles , with nothing to distinguish one from the other			0
the unknown warrior 's body was brought from @entity11 and buried on november 11 , 1920			1
the idea is believed to have come from reverend @entity86 , who had been a chaplain on the @entity87			2
some 1.2million people visited the @entity6 during the week after the burial , and the site is one of the world ’s most visited war graves			2
in 2011 , the @entity94 followed the poignant royal tradition of having her wedding bouquet left at the grave			0
the late queen mother began this when her posy was left at the grave in 1923 after her wedding to the @entity103 , later @entity104			0
she laid the bouquet in tribute to her older brother @entity107 who was killed at the @entity108 in 1915 aged 26			0
his burial place was only found after her death in 2002			0
the biblical text on the tomb is taken from 2 chronicles 24:16 , which says : ' they buried him among the kings , because he had done good toward @entity116 and toward his house '			0
' the door of the hut was locked and sentries posted outside			0
' in the morning a general entered the hut , placed his hand on one of the flag - shrouded coffins and the body therein became the @entity5			1
’ another chaplain , reverend @entity86 , is said to have got the idea for the @entity5 after noticing a grave in @entity11 in 1916 with a cross and the words ‘ an unknown @entity47 soldier ’			1
four years later in 1920 he wrote to the @entity67 , @entity134 , with his idea , and the body was chosen from servicemen exhumed from four battle areas - @entity59 , @entity139 , the @entity140 and the @entity141			1
it is said that brigadier general @entity143 chose the body at random , before the other bodies were reburied			1
confirmed accounts state there were only four bodies , according to @entity6 's website , but @entity15 ’s claim of there being six puts that figure in some doubt			1
the @entity52 : @entity155 will be broadcast on @entity156 tonight at 8pm			0
featured : in another part of tonight 's @entity163 special programme , the family of @entity158 who won a @entity159 for heroic action in the conflict , are pictured with presenter @entity165 also in the show : @entity167 meets @entity169 guest @entity168 whose grandfather died in action during the war archive : the back page of the @entity174 from november 12 , 1920 , with pictures of the funeral service			2
