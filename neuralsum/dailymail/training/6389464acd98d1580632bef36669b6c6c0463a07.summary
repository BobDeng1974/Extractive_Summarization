by @entity0 published : 21:10 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 04:22 est , 4 january 2013 you may not get blood from a stone , but if you happen to have one from @entity5 , you may get water			0
a yearlong study of a coal - colored rock from the @entity5 that was found in the @entity9 has revealed that not only is it older than other @entity5 meteorites , but it also contains 10 times more water than the rest			1
the baseball - size meteorite , estimated to be 2 billion years old , is strikingly similar to the volcanic rocks examined on the @entity5 surface by the @entity19 rovers @entity17 , which found water - bearing minerals			1
@entity21 : an examination of the @entity5 meteorite known as @entity21 that landed in the @entity9 determined it is 2.1 billion years old and is water - rich @entity21 7034 is made of cemented fragments of basalt , rock that forms from rapidly cooled lava			1
the fragments are primarily feldspar and pyroxene , most likely from volcanic activity			0
this unusual meteorite 's chemistry matches that of the @entity5 crust as measured by @entity19 's @entity17 and @entity35			1
‘ here we have a piece of @entity5 that i can hold in my hands			0
that 's really exciting , ’ said @entity36 , director of the @entity37 and curator at the @entity39 who led the study published online thursday in the journal @entity43			2
' this @entity5 meteorite has everything in its composition that you 'd want in order to further our understanding of the @entity5 , ' he said			2
' this unique meteorite tells us what volcanism was like on @entity5 2 billion years ago			1
' it also gives us a glimpse of ancient surface and environmental conditions on @entity5 that no other meteorite has ever offered			0
' a scan of the meteorite : white material is ilmenite , light gray crystals are cl - apatite , medium dark crystals are andesine , darkest crystals are sanidine ( k - feldspar ) , and white fine grained crystals are magnetite or other iron - oxide most space rocks that fall to @entity74 as meteorites originate in the asteroid belt , but a number come from the moon and @entity5			0
scientists believe an asteroid or some other large object struck @entity5 , dislodging rocks and sending them hurling into space			0
occasionally , some plummet through @entity74 's atmosphere			0
short of sending a spacecraft or astronaut to the @entity5 to haul back rocks , @entity5 meteorites are the next best thing for scientists seeking to better understand how @entity74 's neighbor transformed from a tropical environment to a frigid desert			1
light microscopy images of a feldspar grain in the @entity21 meteorite showing the different particles researchers found about 110 @entity5 rocks have been recovered on @entity74 , mostly in @entity100 or the @entity9			1
the oldest dates back 4.5 billion years to a time when @entity5 was warmer and wetter			0
about half a dozen @entity5 meteorites are 1.3 billion years old and the rest are 600 million years or younger			0
the latest meteorite @entity106 ( @entity21 ) 7034 - nicknamed ‘ @entity21 ’ - was donated to the @entity39 by an @entity107 who bought it from a @entity111 meteorite dealer last year			1
the latest meteorite @entity106 ( @entity21 ) 7034 - nicknamed @entity112 - was donated to the @entity39 by an @entity107 who bought it from a @entity111 meteorite dealer last year			2
ancient find : this @entity5 rock , which fell in @entity117 , @entity118 in 1911 , is particularly large meteorite from the @entity5 unusual discovery : scientists believe that the meteorite found in @entity9 was formed by cooling lava in the @entity5 crust researchers performed a battery of tests on the meteorite and based on its chemical signature confirmed that it was blasted to @entity74 from @entity5			1
almost all @entity5 meteorites can be put in one of three groups known as @entity134 , @entity135 , and @entity136 - named for the locations where the first of each type of meteorite was discovered - which scientists refer to simply as @entity142			2
but according to researchers , the @entity9 find belongs in a class of its own			1
one of a kind : unlike other @entity5 meteorites , the ' @entity21 ' does not fit into any pf the existing classifications of rocks from the @entity5 missing link : the @entity9 find may help scientists understand how @entity74 's neighbor transformed from a tropical environment to a frigid desert at 2.1 billion years old , it 's the second - oldest known @entity5 meteorite that formed from a volcanic eruption			1
when the researchers compared the geochemical makeup of the meteorite to data from soil and rock samples obtained by @entity5 rovers , they discovered that it likely came from the planet 's crust , not its mantle			1
while researchers have found meteorites formed from chunks of basalt cemented together in the moon 's crust , they have never seen anything like this on @entity5			0
there 's also evidence that it was altered by water			0
though the amount released during heating was small - 6,000 parts per million - it was still about 10 times more than other @entity5 meteorites			0
scientists said this suggested there was interaction with water near the surface during a time when the planet was mostly dry and dusty			0
outer space : rocknest 3 is a rock approximately 15 inches long and 4 inches tall , next to the @entity199 patch of windblown dust and sand where @entity202 scooped and analyzed soil samples @entity5 mission : a rock outcrop called link pops out from a @entity5 surface that is elsewhere blanketed by reddish - brown dust , showing evidence for an ancient , flowing stream more tests are under way to determine how long the rock floated in space and how long it had been sitting in the @entity9			1
@entity216 meteorite expert @entity215 said the find was welcome since most @entity5 rocks that rain on @entity74 tend to be younger			2
the latest find does not appear to be too contaminated , he said			0
‘ it 's fairly fresh			0
' it has n't been subjected to a whole lot of weathering , ’ said @entity215 , who had no role in the research the discovery of the ' @entity21 ' meteorite may shed light on @entity5 ' distant past , which was possibly much wetter and warmer than previously believed			2
' the contents of this meteorite may challenge many long held notions about @entity5 geology , " said @entity231 , associate administrator for @entity19 's @entity232 in @entity233			1
' these findings also present an important reference frame for the @entity202 as it searches for reduced organics in the minerals exposed in the bedrock of @entity243			2

2 billion year old meteorite was discovered in the @entity9 desert
*cricket* ball sized object is an entirely new class of *martian* meteorite
@entity19 says discovery could lead them to change @entity202 's plans to find out more
