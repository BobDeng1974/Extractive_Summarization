a fish caught off the coast of @entity2 has set a new record in the state as its oldest fish , living to the age of 84			1
the 60 - centimetre long female bight redfish - its scientific name @entity7 - was captured in november last year			1
the maximum length of this species of fish is usually 46 centimetres			0
the 60 - centimetre long female bight redfish - its scientific name @entity7 - was captured in november last year but scientists were only able to identify its age until now as they needed to look at its bones			1
' it 's not possible to tell the age of a fish from looking at it			2
so its age was n't discovered until its skeleton went under the microscope at the @entity30 ' @entity29 research centre just recently , ' fisheries minister @entity24 said			1
the age of the fish was determined by the number of growth rings of the inner ear bones known as the otoliths			1
it is similar to the process used to find out the age of trees by the cross-section of its trunks			0
the find knocked off a previous record of 78 years held jointly by a western foxfish ( @entity46 ) and a bass groper ( @entity48 )			0
the age of the fish was determined by the number of growth rings of the inner ear bones known as the otoliths born in 1929 , the @entity52 redfish made its debut into the world at the same time as @entity55 and the @entity56			1
@entity57 took over from @entity58 as @entity2 's ninth prime minister			0
current prime minister @entity60 is the 28th			0
the fish 's skeleton was collected as part of a @entity66 office funded research project to assess the overall health of south coast stocks			2
it was caught off the south coast of @entity2 and handed into the state 's @entity30 where it was looked at by researchers who determined its age determining the fish 's age was a joint effort between researchers from the @entity30 and @entity80 's @entity79			2
mr @entity24 said it was encouraging the research was being supported by recreational fishers and commercial fish processors on the south coast who have been donating fish frames of the required species with skeleton and head left intact after filleting			2
bight redfish is one of the key species being checked			0
the project is also looking at pink snapper , blue morwong and donated frames of three near shore finfish species - @entity99 herring , @entity102 whiting and tailor .			0

the 60 - cm long female @entity52 redfish was captured november last year
it only recently had age confirmed as scientists needed to look at skeleton
age of the fish was determined by number of rings of the inner ear bones
it was born in 1929 , the same year @entity55 and @entity56 made debut
