@entity0 will face a player she inspired to take up tennis after reaching her first grand slam quarter - final since 2010 in the @entity4			1
@entity0 defeated sixth seed @entity6 6 - 3 2 - 6 6 - 1 on @entity7 to set up a last - eight clash with @entity10 teenager @entity9 , who had earlier beaten compatriot @entity11 in straight sets			1
@entity9 , 19 , has made no secret of her admiration for the @entity0 sisters , although it is something the siblings might not like being reminded of too often			1
' she was watching me in diapers			2
' @entity23 ( 1 ) vs @entity27 ( 11 ) @entity9 vs @entity0 ( 18 ) @entity28 ( 10 ) vs @entity29 ( 3 ) @entity31 ( 7 ) @entity30 ( 2 ) @entity0 ' last quarter - final appearance in a grand slam came in the @entity34 in 2010 , the year before she was diagnosed as suffering from @entity36 's syndrome , a debilitating autoimmune disease			1
keys was just five years old when @entity0 won the first of her seven grand - slam singles titles at @entity41 in 2000 and is relishing the prospect of facing one of her childhood heroes			1
' i 'm just really excited , ' she said			2
' i think it 's a huge opportunity for me			2
i have n't been in this situation before			2
i 'm going to make the most of it			2
i want to be at the end of the tournament holding the trophy up			2
that 's my goal in the long run			2

she was a huge part of that			0
just watching her is inspirational			0
she 's had her health battles but she loves tennis			0
she 's still out here and she 's doing it remarkably well			0

' 19 - year - old @entity9 will come up against her childhood hero in the last eight in @entity70 the @entity10 youngster signs autographs after beating compatriot @entity11 in straight sets keys could have to face both @entity0 sisters if she wants to win the title , with @entity23 taking on @entity27 in the other quarter - final in the top half of the draw			1
top seed @entity23 had some help from her fans to thank for overcoming another slow start - and a coughing fit - to defeat @entity84 's @entity83 in three sets and gain a measure of revenge for her defeat at the hands of the 24th seed in the second round of last year 's @entity93			1
@entity83 won 6 - 2 6 - 2 at @entity93 and threatened to do the same here as she won four games in a row from 2 - 2 in the opening set			1
@entity0 , who had to save three set points against @entity99 in round two and then came from a set down to defeat @entity101 , won the second set 6 - 3 to level the match and then crucially held serve at the start of the decider			1
the world no 1 had to save six break points in an epic game lasting 13 minutes and promptly broke a disheartened opponent on her way to taking the set by a flattering 6 - 2 scoreline			1
@entity0 admitted the shouted advice of one spectator to ' use spin ' helped her turn the match around , adding : ' she ( @entity83 ) played so well and she did everything she needed to do in the first set			1
@entity23 overcame a slow start to gain revenge over her @entity93 conqueror @entity83 the world no 1 stretches for a shot en route to a comeback 2 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 victory in the fourth round ' i just decided to do my best and stay focused and stay relaxed			1
she hits the ball really , really big and hard , but someone in the crowd was like ' @entity133 '			0
i was like ' okay ' and it really helped me			0
' @entity0 struggled with a cough during the match and the 33 - year - old said she had been ' a little sick the past couple of days '			1
she added : ' i 've been fighting it with vitamin c and all kinds of stuff			0
i definitely feel better than yesterday			0
' @entity27 reached the last eight after a see - saw battle with former champion @entity145 under the roof on @entity7			1
a morning rain shower quickly cleared but the roof remained closed for the duration of a hard - fought fourth - round clash which @entity27 eventually won 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 3			1
' i just walked on court and all the great memories come to my mind , ' said @entity27 , who lost to @entity153 in last year 's final			2
' i just have to believe in myself and that 's what i am doing right now			0
' the first set i was killing her from the forehand and then she started stepping inside the court and to serve much better			0
i felt like i had to put in something extra and play really , really good and that 's what i did			2
' @entity0 will face @entity27 ( right ) after she defeated former champion @entity145 ( left ) @entity145 , who won the title in 2012 and 2013 but was unseeded this year due to an injury - plagued 2014 , led 2 - 0 in each set but lost six games in a row in the opening set and six out of seven in the decider			1
' i take it as progress , ' she said			0
' i think there are a lot of positive things to take from here			0
it 's a good start			0
there was some good quality tennis , even though the result is not the one that i wanted			0
' but i need to be realistic a little bit and keep working hard and try to sharpen my game			0
i need to be more consistent and i need to be able to take my opportunities when i have them			0
overall i can be pretty happy but i 'm such a perfectionist that i do n't want to be satisfied			0
