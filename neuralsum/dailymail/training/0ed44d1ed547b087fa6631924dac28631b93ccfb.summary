by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 04:26 est , 18 june 2013 a couple who drove 270 miles across @entity2 to catch a 20 - hour cross-channel ferry to @entity4 ended up on a tiny ten - minute commuter boat instead after following their sat - nav			1
@entity7 and @entity8 had booked themselves on the £ 100million @entity10 from @entity11 to @entity12 in @entity4 but then got stuck on the nearby @entity14 ferry after a wrong turn			1
they were due to join 2,400 holidaymakers on the overnight crossing on the huge @entity20 ' flagship , but accidentally took a boat which held 70 cars and ferried them to @entity23 for £ 1.50			1
lost : @entity7 and @entity8 , pictured on their holiday after eventually making it to @entity4 , despite taking a ferry to @entity23 when they followed their sat - nav map : after missing their turning at the end of their long journey from @entity35 , they ended up crossing an estuary to @entity23 , not to @entity4 the couple had made it safely their home in @entity35 to @entity11 - and drove straight onto the @entity14 ferry instead which takes just ten minutes to cross the @entity42			1
mr and mrs @entity44 quickly realised their mistake - blamed on their satnav - when they found themselves trapped among 70 cars on the local crossing			1
and instead of seeing the shores of @entity4 they were greeted by the sight of @entity23			1
the embarrassed couple , who are in their mid-seventies , explained what had happened to staff on the @entity14 ferry			1
@entity61 : the @entity8 family were heading for the @entity20 ship , @entity10 , but took a wrong turn spot the difference : instead the couple took the @entity67 , which helps drivers cross the @entity42 for £ 1.50 they radioed the nearby continental ferry port as they took them straight back to @entity11 on the return crossing			1
the couple , who split their time between @entity35 and @entity76 , were then fast - tracked onto the right ferry just in the nick of time for their crossing			1
' we 'd had some hold - ups on the drive down and got to @entity11 only 40 minutes before the departure , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' so we were more than relieved when our sat nav announced that we had reached our destination			2
' on joining one of the queues we were then ushered on to the ferry			2
' when the truth dawned on us we had to accept the worst			2
it was impossible to drive off - we were jammed in			2
' feeling very embarrassed i got out of the car and explained the situation to the attendant			2
' expecting him to take one look at us and think that we were a couple of confused old codgers , we are in our mid-seventies , i would never have believed the response			0
' where it went wrong : this sign shows that the @entity105 should have turned left for their ferry , but instead went straight on @entity7 and @entity8 were allowed to straight on and off in @entity23 and then taken back to @entity11 where they were let off first			1
a @entity108 driver then volunteered to guide them the right ferry which they boarded just in time for their 20 - hour overnight crossing			1
@entity7 added : ' we 'll be forever grateful for the kindness shown by a gentleman in the adjacent queue who we happened to speak to			1
' i told him of our hopeless situation and he at once asked if we knew our way to the ferry			2
' he said that if we waited for him once we were off then he would lead us there			0
' we arrived by the skin of our teeth and were the last car to board			0
' our good @entity108 just turned around and waved to us , not waiting for any thanks for what seemed like a miracle to us			0
' help ! the couple got trapped on the ferry to @entity23 but staff radioed the main ferry port to hold the ferry to @entity4 the @entity14 ferry is a car and pedestrian ferry connecting @entity138 to east @entity23			1
the service was established in 1791 and three chain operated ferries costing around £ 5million each are currently in service			0
each can carry 73 vehicles and operates using its own slipways and parallel chains across the busy @entity42			0

@entity67 bosses said they were more than happy to help out @entity7 and @entity8 - who were not the first holidaymakers to find themselves on the wrong crossing			1
