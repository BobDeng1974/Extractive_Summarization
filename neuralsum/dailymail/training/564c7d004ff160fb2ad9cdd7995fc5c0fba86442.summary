by @entity0 @entity1 : 15:37 est , 31 december 2013 updated : 04:41 est , 1 january 2014 power company which left tens of thousands of customers without electricity on @entity5 are due to pay out millions of pounds in compensation			1
@entity7 , who made a profit of £ 1.4bn last year , failed to get electricity to 19,500 users in south @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 on december 25 due to flood damage			2
on tuesday afternoon it confirmed it would pay £ 75 compensation to every customer , regardless of how long the outage lasted , bringing its bill to almost £ 1.5million			1
power companies are facing payouts worth millions of pounds to customers after leaving tens of thousands without electricity over @entity5 @entity24 , who had 30,000 customers in @entity27 , @entity13 and @entity28 without power on @entity5 have matched the offer - treble the legal minimum of £ 27 - costing them another £ 2.5million			1
however the total bill is likely to be higher as customers without power for 60 hours are paid more , and are then paid again for every 12 additional hours it takes to get the problem fixed			2
@entity7 will be writing to every customer who is able to receive the payment to inform them , while @entity24 is asking customers to write to them if they think they are eligible			1
some @entity24 customers were still without electricity five days after the @entity44 storms , as the ceo @entity45 admitted fixing power lines had taken so long because engineers were on holiday			2
meanwhile politicians have lined up to criticise the power companies ' performance , with mp @entity52 confirming that bosses will be called before parliament in the new year to explain themselves			0
he told the @entity55 : ' i 'm very concerned about how long the network distribution companies took to restore power to thousands of customers			0
the @entity60 will call them in when the @entity62 gets back			0
there were just four people left without power on monday in @entity28 , but bad weather is now forecast for the rest of january raising fears of more outages ' i 'm already concerned that these distribution companies are not properly scrutinised by @entity71 , despite being effectively monopolies			0
their performance over @entity5 was unacceptable			0
' @entity75 , the environment secretary , said that energy companies had failed to prepare for the bad weather by sending too many staff away on holiday			0
he branded the poor performance ' unacceptible ' and said that bosses had let their customers down badly			0
under the law energy companies are required to pay £ 27 to any customer without power for 48 hours , and then pay another £ 54 for anyone without electricity for between 60 and 72 hours			1
customers are then paid again every 12 hours until the problem is fixed , up to a maximum of £ 216			0
however @entity24 said last week that it would voluntarily treble the initial payout to £ 75 as a ' gesture of goodwill ' , with customers being paid £ 108 after that , up to a maximum of £ 432			1
today @entity7 matched that offer , adding that anyone who experienced a power outage on @entity5 qualified for the £ 75 payout , no matter how long it lasted .			1

@entity7 and @entity24 to pay customers for outages
payment for those without power on @entity5 upped from £ 27 to £ 75
compensation for those without power for longer periods also *increased*
companies now facing total costs of more than £ *4million*
