violence : an armed mob ' lured ' police on to the streets by firebombing a pub so they could attack them during last summer 's riots , a court heard today			0
this dramatic image shows a gunman firing a gun at police officers armed : the mob fired at least 12 shots at officers from four guns during the night of ' orchestrated violence ' in @entity13 , a jury was told			1
this image shows some of those involved that night wearing masks but in contrast to other incidents during the riots which spread across the country and saw large - scale looting , nothing else was stolen from any of the businesses because the dozens of masked and hooded men responsible for this incident had a ‘ different agenda ’			1
mr @entity53 said : ‘ this was an event in which they carried out a series of acts that they knew a large number of police officers would be deployed to deal with			2
‘ it was their aim to get a large number of police officers out on the streets where they could then be attacked ... they were out on the street armed and intent on violence			1
’ it had ‘ all the hallmarks of a planned event ’ , with two groups of men – the first numbering 25 or 26 , and the second an unspecified number - converging on the pub and ‘ a cheer going up ’ when they came together			1
the jury was shown dramatic @entity81 footage of some of them smashing their way into the pub with baseball bats shortly before midnight on august 9 last year before one lit a firebomb in the bar			0
four people were upstairs in the pub at the time , which would have been obvious to the men attacking it as the upstairs lights were on , mr @entity53 added			0
vandalised : the jury was told that the @entity16 pub , pictured , in the inner city @entity18 area of @entity13 was set fire to before furniture from it was used to build a ' makeshift barricade ' and to smash into other nearby shops and offices the occupants dialled 999 when they heard the windows breaking and one of them rushed downstairs with a fire extinguisher when the intruders left			1
as the police were deployed , some of the group moved away and one could be seen on the @entity81 firing a handgun			0
a police helicopter followed them as they left the area			0
on monday , six men and two youths went on trial at @entity120 over the incident			1
they are @entity122 , 20 , @entity123 , 26 , and @entity124 , 19 , and two 17 year olds , who can not be named for legal reasons , all of @entity13			2
they were joined by @entity129 , 25 , of @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , of @entity133 , and @entity134 , 27 , of @entity135 , @entity136			0
planned : the court was told that it was the aim of the mob to get a large number of police officers out on the streets where they could then be attacked			2
this image showing a member of the mob was taken from the police helicopter in the dock : six men and two youths have gone on trial at @entity120 over the incident they are each charged with riot , violent disorder , possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life , and arson being reckless to whether life would be endangered			1
mr @entity53 said not all the defendants could be shown to have been carrying guns themselves , but it is the prosecution case that all of them ‘ encouraged or supported ’ those who did			1
similarly , the firebombing of the pub was a ‘ joint venture ’			2
the jury was told they will hear evidence that some of the defendants had met the day before to discuss what they were going to do			0
they also heard that there is a series of links between them , ranging from having been to school together to socialising			0
the eight defendants each deny all four charges			0
some of them say they were incorrectly identified as being present , while others claim they were there but were not involved in the disorder			0

they fired at least 12 shots at officers from four guns during the night of ‘ orchestrated violence ’ in @entity13 , a jury is told
six men and two youths have now gone on trial over the incident
