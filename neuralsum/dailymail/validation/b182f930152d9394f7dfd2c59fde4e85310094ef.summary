@entity2 goalkeeper and captain @entity1 is unlikely to lose his place in the national side despite a recent poor run for his club @entity7 , coach @entity0 said on wednesday			1
@entity1 is one player , along with @entity9 winger @entity8 , who has been blamed by @entity7 fans for the @entity13 champions ' slump and he was again the target of their ire during tuesday 's 4 - 3 @entity17 loss at home to @entity20 side @entity19			1
although they squeezed through to the quarter - finals 5 - 4 on aggregate , @entity1 and his team mates were whistled off the @entity26 pitch by their angry supporters , already fuming after @entity7 gave up the @entity30 lead to @entity31 with a loss to @entity33			1
@entity1 was blamed for this goal as @entity19 's @entity35 pounced on his poor parry @entity35 buried his finish and the @entity7 fans booed their keeper after the 4 - 3 @entity17 loss ' he did not play well and he admitted that , ' @entity0 said in an interview with @entity43			1
' he also saved @entity7 at the end , ' added the 64 - year - old , who coached @entity1 when he was in charge at @entity7 between 1999 and 2003			0
' we do n't have to make a change unless the dip in form is alarming			0
i think he is in good shape			0
' @entity0 has plenty of options if he decides to call time on @entity1 's international career , with the likes of @entity60 ( @entity61 ) and @entity62 ( @entity63 ) pushing for a starting place			0
@entity1 's apparent drop in form does n't bother @entity2 coach @entity0 who 's back his keeper @entity1 ( left ) shows his disappointment alongside @entity70 after @entity7 's loss to @entity19 however , he has consistently backed his captain during several difficult periods in recent years and is unlikely to drop him unless he suffers a sustained slump			1
@entity1 has made 160 appearances for @entity2 , more than any other player , and led the side to back - to - back @entity13 crowns in 2008 and 2012 with the nation 's debut @entity80 triumph in between in 2010			2
@entity2 's next game is a @entity85 qualifier at home to @entity87 on march 27			0
with four matches played , @entity2 are second in @entity89 on nine points , three behind leaders @entity92 , who beat them 2 - 1 in @entity94 in october , and level with @entity87			0
@entity1 is helpless as @entity97 defender @entity96 opens the scoring for @entity19 on 20 minutes the keeper and captain admitted his team had hit rock bottom after a recent poor run of results			2

@entity2 coach @entity0 has backed keeper @entity1
@entity1 is in a slump for @entity7 but safe in the national side
@entity1 , along with @entity8 , are being blamed for @entity7 's poor run
@entity7 lost 4 - 3 to @entity19 on tuesday but still *scraped* through to the @entity17 quarter - finals
