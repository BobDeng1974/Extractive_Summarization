' she can walk , talk ; she ate chili in the car , ' her mother , @entity54 , said as her dark - haired daughter strolled through a cavernous greenhouse full of marijuana plants that will later be broken down into their anti-seizure components and mixed with olive oil so patients can consume them			1

' doctors warn there is no proof that @entity7 is effective , or even safe			1

@entity152 , vice president of the @entity153 , warned that a few miraculous stories may not mean anything — epileptic seizures come and go for no apparent reason — and scientists do not know what sort of damage @entity7 could be doing to young brains			1

@entity15 is a twin , but her sister , @entity210 , does n't have @entity113 's syndrome , which kills kids before they reach adulthood			1
in early 2012 , it seemed @entity15 would be added to that grim roster			0
