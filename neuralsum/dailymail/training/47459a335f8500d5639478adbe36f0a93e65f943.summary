futuristic : @entity1 as chief @entity2 in minority report when police in minority report predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it , it was considered so futuristic , the film was set in 2054			0
now , however , law enforcers in two @entity13 states are using crime - prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder , and supervising them accordingly			1
instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records , the new system uses a computer algorithm to decide for them			1
the minority report - style software is already being used in @entity27 and @entity28 to predict future murderers , and will be extended to @entity30 soon			2
it has been developed by professor @entity32 , a criminologist at the @entity33 , who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes			1
prof. @entity32 says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future			1
it could also be modified to predict lesser crimes			0
he told @entity44 that currently parole officers are using their own judgment to decide what level of supervision each parolee should have , based on their criminal record			1
his software , he said , replaces that ' ad - hoc ' decision making , and should identify eight future murderers out of 100			2
he said : ' people assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future , but what really matters is what that person did as a young individual			0
' if they committed armed robbery at age 14 , that 's a good predictor			0
' if they committed the same crime at age 30 , that does n't predict very much			0
' prof. @entity32 's researchers used the details of more than 60,000 crimes then wrote an algorithm to find the people behind the crimes who were more likely to commit murder when they were out of prison			1
pre-cog : @entity81 plays a human who can see into the future in minority report the software predicts future criminals like the ' @entity87 ' in the @entity1 film who can see crimes not yet committed future murderer ? @entity92 , centre , and @entity94 , right , co-starred with @entity1 in minority report criteria including criminal record , type of crime , location , and age at which the individual committed the crime were analysed , with type of crime and age proving to be the most reliable predictors of future crime			2
he said even his students at the @entity33 compared his work to @entity95 , the 2002 film starring @entity1 in which gifted humans called ' @entity87 ' can see into the future and predict who will commit crimes			0
in the film , @entity1 plays the elite crime squad head chief @entity2 , who himself is accused of committing a murder in the future			0
prof. @entity32 's work has been described as ' very impressive ' by @entity123 , a professor of criminal justice at the @entity125 at @entity126			1
however he cautioned that human rights campaigners might see that the extra supervision mandated by the software for those deemed most likely to murder might amount to harassment			2
@entity133 hit : minority report , directed by @entity133 , features @entity135 actor @entity94 as @entity137 agent @entity136			0
