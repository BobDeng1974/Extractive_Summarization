so comprehensive were their victories , and so enticing a prospect , that it was difficult to resist wondering about a quarter - final meeting between @entity5 and @entity6 as they each completed demolition jobs on thursday			1
combined , the pair lost just five games , won 108 points out of 165 , and spent no more than one hour and 49 minutes on @entity12 1 , almost as if neither much fancied exposing their bodies to the summer chill for very long			1
@entity5 was quicker , beating @entity16 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 in 49 minutes — the third shortest time at these @entity18 — and afterwards claimed she still had improvements to make			1
stars : both @entity6 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) won with ease and the two could meet in the quarter - final not so stretching : @entity6 is made to work for a point but ran out a very comfortable winner focus : @entity5 says there is more to come from her but she looked in ruthless form the five - time champion bore the attitude of someone carrying out a tiresome household chore as she swatted the ball this way and that to send the 30 - year - old @entity36 on shuttle runs of futile purpose			1
if @entity5 can focus her mind you imagine more challenging tasks that await will be similarly conquered			1
there were trademark returns slapped back with interest and a couple of aces measuring 113mph and 115mph to entertain the crowd			0
she was a prickly presence in the press conference which followed , at one point asking when it would be over , but perhaps that was due to lack of sleep having only finished a doubles match with sister @entity57 the previous evening at 8.59pm			0
@entity5 took a tumble into the crowd during that win — ‘ i had some lovely gents able to break my fall ’ — and added : ‘ i felt okay today			2
i do n’t want to feel great necessarily right now because hopefully i have several more matches i can play			0
‘ the goal for me is just to feel a little better every day			0
struggle : @entity6 has not won the @entity67 title since beating @entity5 as a 17 - year - old in 2004 ‘ it ’s important not to peak too soon , keep working on your game , always have room for improvement			1
‘ i feel there ’s some things i still want to work on to hopefully stay in the tournament			0
’ @entity5 can equal @entity77 and @entity79 ’s haul of 18 @entity81 titles if she wins here — her last major came at the @entity84 last september — and even at 32 , she has a growing appetite for success			1
‘ it is stronger than ever , ’ she said			0
‘ i have desire to do more			0
’ @entity6 is five years younger but just as experienced and hungry			2
the pair met in the @entity67 final of 2004 , which the @entity91 won aged only 17 , but she has not lifted the @entity92 since			1
last year she was knocked out in the second round , falling , quite literally , to @entity94 , who was then world no 131			0
runaway : @entity5 beet @entity36 @entity16 in just 49 minutes - the third fastest win this year @entity98 , world no 85 , presented no such challenge yesterday , beaten 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 as @entity6 extended her lithe limbs to reach devious angles and get speed across the grass			1
with a second @entity105 in her bag , @entity6 is on form and a threat			2
but @entity5 ’s shadow is already looming			2
‘ we have played each other many times , ’ said @entity6 , who has a 16 - 2 losing record against the @entity111			1
‘ i always look forward to that challenge to play against the best , try something a little bit different to get a win out there			0
’ first up in round three is @entity119 , a 23 - year - old @entity111 , who has already scalped a seed here			0
for @entity5 , it is 25th seed @entity122 , a @entity124 player who beat her more esteemed competitor on the hard courts of @entity127 earlier this season .			2

@entity6 and @entity5 dropped just 5 games between them
@entity5 saw off @entity16 6 - 1 6 - 1
@entity6 *thrashed* @entity98 6 - 2 6 - 1
between them they have won six @entity67 titles
