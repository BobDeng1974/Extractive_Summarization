by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 14 november 2013 a terrified woman discovered a stranger has been repeatedly creeping in to her house when she checked her mobile phone - and found a picture of a man she 'd never met , calmly sitting at her dining table			1
chillingly , she realised the man was in her house at the same time she was home and had been there before - perhaps even as she showered			1
@entity10 ( her name has been changed to protect her identity ) , from the @entity14 area of @entity15 , @entity16 , said she would only feel safe in her own home again when the sinister man was found			1
@entity19 : the picture of a strange man that a @entity15 woman found on her phone , taken in her house while she was home the woman , who is in her 30s , said : ' in the picture he looks comfortable in my home			1
i showed the picture to friends and family and they are absolutely horrified			0
' i think when the photo was taken i had been in the shower			0
' ' it took me a week before i could stay in the house again			1
' now , every time i hear a noise i flinch			2
it 's the fact that he sat at my dining table , while i was in the house and if it was n't for him taking that picture i would n't have ever known			1
that 's what frightened me the most			0
' the creepiest thing was him not taking anything of worth , it 's unnerving			0
i want to know who he is and why he came into my home			2
i wo n't feel safe until i know who he is			2
@entity10 think he may have taken the image as she showered the woman was stunned at the image , which shows her lounge from the dining table , complete with her handbag and the man captured in the mirror , and she tried to come up with an explanation			1
when she could n't she made the horrible realisation the intruder was in as she was at home			1
he is bald , has a beard and appears to wear earrings and a ring on his wedding finger			0
she said : ' my bag was there and my phone			0
i do n’t leave the house without them			2
the more i looked the more i genuinely did n’t know the guy			2
' he had n’t just been in my home , but he did it while i was there			2
the initial indicators that @entity10 ’s home was being invaded began in late september after she and her teenage daughter decided to go on a healthy - eating diet			1
packets of crisps and biscuits were off limits to them both but @entity10 began to notice pack after pack go missing			1
her son , who has a stomach condition , was unlikely to be the culprit			0
she added : ' my daughter was at home a few hours before i came home from work and when i got back there would be crisps and chocolate missing			1
' my daughter and i are dieting together and i 'd accuse her of cheating , but she would insist she had n't			2
' entire packs of biscuits would disappear and multipack crisps would turn into one single packet			0
i was convinced it was her			0
the @entity14 area of @entity15 , @entity16 , where ' @entity10 ' lives ' then a cousin asked me to put photos of my grandmother together for a collage and i went through my phone			1
' the woman , who is in her 30s , phoned police immediately and the following day had every locked in her flat changed - even installing a safety mechanism on her loft hatch			0
since then no food has gone missing			1
' all the locks have now been changed , there 's bolts on the patio doors and i 'm contemplating getting a dog , ' she added			0
police believe the photo was taken between october 9 and 11 and wish to speak to the man in relation to the offence of burglary			0
anyone with information about the man should call police on 101 or call @entity142 on 0800 555111 quoting crime reference number @entity143 / 13/10533			0
do you know this man ? e-mail @entity148 .			0

she only discovered man had been in house after finding chilling image
@entity155 discovered it 20 days after it was taken as she looked at pictures
he was there at the same time as her - perhaps as she showered
she was *confused* by missing food in her @entity15 home in recent weeks
@entity10 ( not her real name ) says she ca n't relax until home invader is found
