the border collie puppies are looking for new homes but visitors at the @entity12 farm and theme park in @entity14 , north @entity7 were treated to a glimpse of the park 's latest arrivals			1
staff were on hand to help the dogs into position but the youngsters clearly found it difficult to be centre of attention and contain their energy			2
it took 15 minutes for a family of border collie puppies to sit still but it was worth it for this sweet photograph the puppies are looking for new homes but went on show at the @entity12 in @entity14 so that visitors could see the new arrivals it 's a hard life being the centre of attention , this border collie found their front paws were lifted up on to a low fence by staff , who quickly ran out of shot			1
they then stood behind photographer @entity48 and made noises to try to hold the puppies ' attention - though perhaps they might have preferred a snack as a bribe			0
some looked a tad bored by proceedings , resting their snouts on their paws and gazing into the distance			0
the puppies were born to one of the farm 's working sheep dogs and will be ready to move in with new owners in a few weeks ' time			1
the distracted dogs were in need of a helping hand from staff to try to get them in the right pose this female puppy looked thoroughly fed up by the time the shoot was over			0
