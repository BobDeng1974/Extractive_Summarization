by @entity0 published : 01:44 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 01:44 est , 27 october 2013 @entity2 did n't tell any of her friends she was going to see her ex-boyfriend on the night he brutally murdered her			1
the 18 - year - old went to @entity7 's home at the request of his mother , her friends believe , because she was worried about her son 's behavior since the breakup and had not been able to get through to him			1
' well , he had gone from a kid who was always on the move , always working out ... to a kid who was basically at home , lying on the couch , looking miserable , ' said @entity20 's uncle , @entity19			1
@entity20 had stopped hanging out with friends			2
he was drinking a lot and smoking pot daily			2
after taking him to see a psychiatrist , his mom thought maybe @entity2 could talk some sense into him			1
and the teen obliged because she , too , had been worried about him			2
@entity29 , left , said : ' i know @entity32 's parents are in the deepest of pain			2
i talked with his mother			2
and we just shared our pain together and cried together ' still painful : @entity2 's father @entity36 breaks down as he talks about his daughter 's tragic and brutal death @entity39 wants her daughter 's story to serve as a wakeup call to other teens in violent relationships : ' she walked right in to this			1
after you have broken up with somebody , you do n't go and see that person alone ever ! ' shock : friends of @entity2 and @entity7 spoke to 48 hours about their volatile relationship but how they never thought @entity7 would be capable of murder her friend @entity53 told @entity54 48 hours : ' she would say like , " do you think i should do something ? do you think i should talk to him ? maybe i should try and help him ? " ' another friend added : ' @entity32 's mom came and visited @entity2 at work ... and asked if it would be a good idea if she reached out to him and talked to him and kind of saw what was going on			1
' on july 3 , 2011 , @entity2 did just that and was seen leaving her job at the mall at 6.45pm while she was on the phone to @entity7			1
she was never seen again			0
@entity53 said : ' we had had plans to hang out all the big group of us that night			0
no one knew that she was going [ to see him ]			0
' the 18 - year - old 's body was found the next day			2
she had been strangled with a bungee chord and her throat had been slashed			2
' she went over to see that he was doing ok			0
for going over to see if he was ok , ' @entity53 said			0
when police searched @entity7 's home they found bloody clothing , bungee chords with blood on them and a blood stain that matched @entity2 's on the garage floor			1
the then - 19 - year - old was arrested and charged with murder and , after a three - week trial earlier this year , he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole - something his uncle believes was too harsh			1
' @entity20 does not deserve to be thrown away			0
before his depression he was a young man with limitless possibilities ... now he is a warehoused person with a number , ' @entity19 said			0
' mental illness is real and nobody asks for it			0
' murder trial : @entity7 and his ex girlfriend @entity2 both went to the same high school loved to death : @entity54 ' @entity105 aired a special on friday centering around @entity2 's murder at the hands of her ex boyfriend @entity7 who could not handle their breakup evidence : a pair of bloody sneakers were found in @entity7 's attic space the day after @entity2 's body was found but @entity2 's mother @entity39 said : ' @entity2 does not have the privilege of re-entering the world , it seems fair that @entity7 should not either			1
' speaking to 48 hours , she said that looking back , there were signs			0
' the signs , although i think they were there , were very , very soft			0
and i construed them as teenage , you know , behavior , ' she said			0
' but there was more to it than that ... and certainly there are things in retrospect that i would pay attention to , like the amount of time not at my house			0
' the amount of time he had her at his house			0
the fact that @entity2 's friends did n't like him at all and the numbers of times she tried to break up with him , that he would n't allow it , i think is another red flag			1
' she wants her daughter 's story to serve as a wakeup call to other teens in violent relationships			1
' she walked right in to this , ' @entity39 said			0
' after you have broken up with somebody , you do n't go and see that person alone ever ! ' ' @entity7 was calculated and planful and organized and purposeful - that 's what the evidence told me			1
and i thought , if you are that , then you must pay			0
if she does n't get out , you do n't get out			0
' victim : @entity2 , pictured , was strangled to death and then had her throat slit by her exboyfriend shackled : @entity7 was sentenced to life without parole in a maximum security prison though @entity2 's father hugged @entity7 's parents right after the verdict telling them , ' sorry , sorry , sorry ' , he lamented after the trial that the boy had still not apologized to them for taking their beautiful and only daughter from them			1
' i know @entity32 is probably numb now regarding the bleakness of his future and what he has lost			0
i hope he will work to keep in mind what each of us has lost , ' @entity29 told the @entity188			2
he has still not apologized for @entity2 's murder			1
the @entity190 promotes healthy teen relationships and raises awareness of the violence towards women at the hands of their husbands or boyfriends			2
comfort : @entity7 's parents @entity201 , right rear , and his wife @entity203 , right , are embraced by @entity2 's father @entity36 after their son was found guilty of murder today in @entity207			1

@entity7 killed his *ex-girlfriend* @entity2 in july 2011 and was sentenced to life in prison
