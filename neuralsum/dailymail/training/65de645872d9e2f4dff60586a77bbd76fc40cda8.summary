by @entity0 published : 20:31 est , 4 august 2012 updated : 08:10 est , 5 august 2012 @entity1 may have been celebrating dominance in the pool and on the tennis court on saturday , but in track and field events the mood was far less joyful			0
@entity8 athletes picked up just three medals , and not a single gold , on the second day of running , jumping and throwing events			2
and to add injury to insult , one of the team 's greatest medal hopes pulled out of the 400m due to a hamstring strain			1
disappointment : @entity19 , right , came second in the women 's 100m on saturday evening in @entity22 agony : @entity24 , left , finished the men 's 10,000m just behind his training partner @entity26 third place : @entity1 's other medal came from @entity29 , who picked up bronze in the long jump while three medals from six events would be a decent haul for most other nations , it is a blow for the @entity8 , which has traditionally dominated track and field			1
to make matters worse , the poor results came on a day dominated by @entity41 , usually seen as the junior partner in the so - called ' special relationship '			2
the team 's first medal of the day came in the men 's long jump , when @entity29 took the bronze with a score of 8.12m			1
@entity29 , an @entity50 21 - year - old competing in his first games , was nearly 20cm behind the gold medallist , @entity41 's @entity54 , who put his home advantage to good use as he jumped 8.31m			1
over : 21 - year - old @entity29 reacts after his 8.12m jump in the final of the field event on saturday bronze : @entity29 poses with the winner and runner - up , @entity41 's @entity54 and @entity65 @entity64 the next @entity8 medallist was long - distance runner @entity24 , who took silver in the men 's 10,000m after completing the course in 27:30.90			1
if the 26 - year - old from @entity71 had matched his own personal best of 26:48.00 , it would have been enough to beat his training partner , @entity26 of the @entity75 , who came in just half a second faster than @entity24			1
veteran sprinter @entity19 was tipped by some for a gold medal in the women 's 100m , but could not do enough to dethrone reigning champion @entity80 , of @entity81			1
@entity82 , 32 , ran 10.78 seconds , only a fraction behind her rival 's 10.75			0
celebration : close friends @entity87 and @entity24 congratulate each other at the conclusion of their race partners : @entity24 showed the rigours of the longest track race as he celebrated with @entity87 the experienced runner had never appeared in the @entity95 before , despite being a three - time @entity97 gold medallist			1
although she holds the title of second - fastest female 100m runner in history , with a personal best of 10.64 , she was unable to break the @entity81 dominance of the ultimate sprint event			2
there are still plenty of track and field medals up for grabs , and @entity1 will be hoping to improve on its patchy record in the days to come			0
patriotic : @entity19 poses with the @entity110 after securing her 100m silver medal greeting : the sprinter waves to the crowd after the event on friday evening in @entity22 not good enough : this image shows how @entity80 landed the gold medal ahead of @entity19 however , one star who will not be able to compete for glory is @entity119 , who won the 400m gold medal in @entity121 four years ago			1
@entity119 was forced to pull out of the first heat on saturday after pulling up with a hamstring problem			2
he had intended to turn the page on a disheartening four years that included an embarrassing , 21 - month drug suspension			0
' it 's very disappointing to ... be dealing with an issue and not be able to finish the race , ' @entity119 said			2
' injured : @entity119 , pictured , walks off the track after failing to finish his men 's 400m round 1 heat ice : the sprinter , pictured , places ice onto his injured hamstring following his failed heat the runner 's hamstring issues stem from an injury he suffered last month during a tuneup race in @entity144			1
but @entity119 is refusing to dwell on his @entity22 misfortune , instead concentrating on the next steps for his career			0
' it 's not the @entity149 , ' he said			0
' the @entity95 is going to come around again			0
next year is a world championship			0
' ' we have a season every year			0
so now it 's a matter of getting healthy and getting back to what i love to do			0

@entity19 wins silver in women 's 100m and @entity24 loses to training partner in men 's 10,000m
only @entity8 medal in field went to long - jumper @entity29
400m runner @entity119 pulls out of games with hamstring injury
