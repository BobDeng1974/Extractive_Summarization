revealing details from inside the jury room for the first time , the juror speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the 25 - year - old ' probably did something wrong '			1
he said that if he was able to vote again , knowing what he knows about the case now , he would vote for her to be convicted of manslaughter			1
emotional : @entity3 ( c ) , with her attorneys @entity24 ( @entity25 ) and @entity26 , reacts to being found not guilty at the @entity27 on july 5 ' generally , none of us liked @entity3 at all , ' he told @entity31			0
' she seems like a horrible person			0
but the prosecutors did not give us enough evidence to convict			1
' they gave us a lot of stuff that makes us think that she probably did something wrong , but not beyond a reasonable doubt			0
' he said that his life ' has been a nightmare ' since @entity44 has been released from jail			1
' i live in fear that someone will find me			1
@entity49 my name every day to see if anyone has figured out who i am , ' he said			0
he said that one of his friend 's wives has banned her husband from talking to him and that his sister has hurled insults at him			2
meanwhile , a @entity60 appeals court denied a request that would have stopped @entity3 from being forced to start a one - year probation sentence for cheque fraud by the end of the week			1
the fifth district court of appeals disagreed with @entity44 's argument that enforcing the probation order would violate the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy			1
@entity44 maintains she already had completed the probation sentence in jail while she was awaiting trial on murder charges in the 2008 death of her two - year - old daughter , @entity3			1
' the petitioner and her attorneys were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement , ' the appellate court said			0
the probation order stems from a sentence circuit judge @entity85 imposed in january 2010 after @entity44 pleaded guilty to stealing checks from a friend			1
at the time , @entity85 said @entity44 should serve the probation upon her release , but those instructions never made it into a written order			1

he said that the vote to convict @entity44 on the four charges of lying to police was unanimous and quick , but that the other votes took longer			1
' we took the first vote on first - degree murder , ' he said			2
' we were 10 to two to acquit			2
so we talked for about thirty minutes , and the two decided that they were willing to change their votes , so first degree was off the table pretty quickly			0
' finally the jurors voted on the manslaughter charge			2
' we did our first vote and it came out half to acquit , half to convict , ' he said			1
' and we talked about it for a while , going through the evidence			2
i 'd say that some people got intense , but there were no personal attacks , no real yelling			0
dead : a @entity60 jury voted to acquit @entity3 of the murder and manslaughter of her daughter @entity3 , pictured ' and we talked for a while , then it was 11 - 1 to acquit			1
and the guy who did n't want to acquit basically looked at us and said , “ ok , whatever you all want			2
” he knew he was n't going to convince us			0
' he said that the jurors then sat there stunned for a few minutes as they realised they were going to set @entity44 free			1
' everyone was just stunned at what we were about to do			0
[ one of the women jurors ] asked me , “ are you okay with this ? ” and i said , “ @entity145 , no. but what else can we do ? we promised to follow the law ”			0
' the juror said that since the trial he has learnt more about the case by reading documents and would now consider changing his vote			2
' but when we were sequestered , we could only go by what the prosecution and defence gave us , he said			0
' if i had to vote now , i 'd probably vote for manslaughter			2
but we did n't get the evidence to support it before			0
i know people are mad at us , but we did our jobs , and i think we did them to the very best of our abilities			0

juror says he lives in fear of being discovered as someone who helped acquit mother
says after seeing *additional* evidence he would now convict her for manslaughter
@entity44 's request to have her one - year probation sentence *dropped* is denied
