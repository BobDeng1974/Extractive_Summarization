@entity1 county cricket clubs have seen their salary cap slashed by 10 per cent with immediate effect , giving them just three months ’ notice before the new season starts			1
the @entity6 informed the 18 first - class counties this week that their wages limit — plus cricket - related travel and hotel costs — was being reduced from £ 2.19million to £ 1.97m			1
and the cutback , that will severely limit major counties ’ spending power on overseas stars , comes when @entity1 ’s t20 tournament is suffering so badly in comparison with @entity20 ’s @entity19 and the @entity21			1
@entity1 county cricket clubs will now find it harder to compete with the money of foreign money @entity6 say move benefits home - grown talent , of which @entity28 , bankrolled by @entity29 , have the most @entity30 , who recruited @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 for the 2013 @entity35 campaign , will be one of the counties worst affected , along with @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity30 chief executive @entity39 said : ‘ we are not at all pleased by the cuts or the short notice given			0
budgets were set for 2015 last september			0
it is artificially dampening down investment in cricket and how can we compete with other t20 competitions around the world with these restrictions ? at the same time @entity1 players ’ salaries have gone up and up			2
’ the @entity6 say the move is to encourage home - grown talent , of which @entity28 , bankrolled by @entity6 chairman elect @entity29 , have the most			2
@entity55 and former @entity57 striker @entity56 in a bizarre new advert for @entity60 whisky @entity56 signed a three - year deal last june to become a global brand ambassador for @entity63 forget the awfulness of the @entity55 promotion ‘ the cool people to watch @entity66 ’ , topped by the @entity56 thumbs - up which has inspired @entity70 to make their own version			0
even worse is @entity56 ’s awkward monotone online advert for @entity73 , panned as one of the worst commercials ever			0
@entity56 signed a three - year deal last june to become a global brand ambassador for @entity63 but even @entity55 colleagues are giving him stick			0
another sign @entity80 is heading to @entity81 is the involvement of agents @entity84 in negotiations			1
@entity84 , who represent the @entity87 , also produce @entity81 ’s golf coverage in partnership with the @entity90			1
and @entity80 , notable for the @entity92 ’s far inferior camera work , is the only major golf event in @entity94 not brought to screens by @entity96			1
another sign @entity80 is heading to @entity81 is the involvement of agents @entity84 in negotiations the @entity87 , who receive around £ 7m a year for the @entity80 rights from the @entity92 , want a minimum £ 10m a year			1
ideally , they would like to keep the @entity92 involved in a share agreement for the live contract , but @entity81 are highly unlikely to pay premium price without exclusivity			2
certainly the @entity87 will want @entity81 to be host broadcaster			2
the billboard wars continue after @entity110 put up a poster outside @entity112 ’ new home , @entity114 in @entity115 , promoting @entity110 ’ long history			0
@entity112 fan @entity117 is seeking £ 800 using crowd - funding to pay for a billboard in @entity110 town centre advertising @entity112 ‘ bringing exciting rugby to the @entity122 since 2014 ’			0
wasps expect another 20,000 - plus crowd against @entity125 on saturday			0
@entity126 will face just one opponent in the election for the @entity130 vice-presidency seat on @entity132 ’s @entity131 @entity133 @entity134 director @entity126 will face just one opponent in the election for the @entity130 vice-presidency seat on @entity132 ’s @entity131			1
@entity137 @entity136 president @entity135 has decided not to stand , leaving a straight choice for the @entity141 @entity140 vote in march between @entity1 representative @entity142 and @entity136 of @entity144 president @entity143			0
@entity142 , who sits on @entity141 ’s @entity131 and is seen by many inside the game as the next @entity136 chairman , is sure to emerge victorious			1
but @entity143 feels aggrieved that the other home nations have reneged on a 2011 deal that the @entity151 role should rotate , with @entity144 never having had a @entity153 representative			0
the @entity136 say reforms that have resulted in a full @entity141 vote , rather than just the home nations , rule out previous agreements			0
marketing agency @entity158 are responsible for the @entity136 ’s advertising promotion around the @entity161 qualifying games , with ‘ together for @entity1 ’ featuring split pictures of players and fans , and tag lines such as pride - passion			0
the same agency have been hired to do something similar by the @entity6 for the @entity169 next summer			2
yet it seems odd the @entity6 are investing in an expensive campaign having just cut county cricket spending as well as rapidly culling staff aged over 50 .			1

@entity6 have slashed wage limits for county cricket clubs
the new limit is £ 1.97m , 10 per cent lower than the previous limit of £ 2.19
the @entity80 looks as though it could be heading to @entity81
@entity134 director @entity126 will face just one opponent in the election for the @entity130 vice-presidency seat on @entity132 ’s @entity131
