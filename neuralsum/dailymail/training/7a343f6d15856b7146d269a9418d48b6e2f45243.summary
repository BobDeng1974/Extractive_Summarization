by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 5 december 2013 an @entity2 veteran has had his benefits slashed after he told @entity5 staff that he had volunteered to sell poppies in honour of his former comrades			1
@entity9 , 60 , was receiving £ 71.20 a week in @entity10 while searching for work after losing a previous job as a pub manager			1
however , when he said he had been raising money for the @entity16 , they told him he was not doing enough to find a new job and withdrew the payment			2
anger : army veteran @entity9 had his benefits cut because he volunteered to sell poppies mr @entity9 served as a @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 during the 1970s and 1980s			1
he volunteered to sell poppies outside an @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , during the fortnight leading up to @entity30 this year , spending a total of 24 hours on the activity			1
when he went to sign on and told workers about his volunteering , they stopped his @entity10 because they said he should be spending his time handing out cvs and applying for work			1
mr @entity9 has now had to live without the payment for four weeks , and is increasingly struggling with his finances			1
' the allowance is not very much , but when you do n't have much , it means a lot , ' the father of four said			2
' it is all wrong			2
you volunteer and sell poppies to remember people and friends you have lost			1
' he spent a total of 16 years in the military , serving with the @entity53 of the @entity54 and the @entity2 from 1972 to 1988			0
good deed : mr @entity9 was raising money for the @entity16 in memory of his former comrades since then mr @entity9 has worked in a number of jobs , including managing pubs around the country , but he has not been employed since november last year			1
he says he has applied for a number of jobs - including at the @entity26 store where he was volunteering - but has received just one response in the past 12 months			1
' i have tried all sorts , ' he said			0
' there are no jobs going , but i am waiting for a call from one application			0
you can apply for every job that is going , but it is another thing actually getting one because there are that many people applying			0
' the former soldier has had to seek financial support from the @entity83 group , but has nonetheless fallen behind with his rent			0
local councillor @entity85 criticised the handling of mr @entity9 's case , saying : ' i was astonished			2
any time i speak with @entity9 you can tell that he has searching for work and has served his country throughout his life			1
' for me , it is an issue of applying discretion and leniency in dealing with such sensitive issues			0
' to treat somebody who has put himself in harm 's way for the people of @entity27 and his country is unacceptable			0
' a spokesman for the @entity103 said : ' it 's only right that people should do everything they can to find work in return for their benefits			2
' we make it clear to people at the start of their claim what the rules are and that they risk losing their benefits if they do n't play by them			0
' sanctions are only used as a last resort and people who are in genuine need can apply for hardship payments			0
if someone disagrees with a decision made on their claim , they can appeal			0

@entity9 , 60 , claimed @entity10 while looking for work

but @entity5 workers decided to withdraw £ 71.20 - a - week payment
