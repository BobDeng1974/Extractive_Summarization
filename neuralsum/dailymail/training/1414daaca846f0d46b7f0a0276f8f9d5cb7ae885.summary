by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 21:43 est , 26 december 2012 couple : @entity3 @entity2 in october a couple who met at one of @entity11 ’s most prestigious universities and married two months ago are set to be forced out of @entity12 by tough new immigration laws			1
@entity3 @entity2 graduated with a degree in astrophysics from @entity6 this summer and married management graduate @entity7 in october			1
his student visa expired the same month			0
but despite marrying a @entity12 woman and contributing at least £ 91,000 to the @entity12 economy , mr @entity2 , 23 , is likely to be barred from living in the @entity11			1
the couple , who want to settle in or around the @entity20 town , say they have little option but to move to the @entity3			2
mr @entity2 , of @entity23 , @entity24 , said he had been ‘ insulted ’ to learn that he was not wanted by the @entity11			1
the previous rules would have allowed him to live north of the @entity26 simply because he was married to a @entity11 national			1
the new system , which is intended to reduce immigration , requires @entity11 citizens to have a minimum income of £ 18,600 before they can bring a spouse from outside the @entity33 to live here			2
after graduating the couple left @entity12 to travel and married in @entity35 , @entity36			0
they will return home on january 16 but it is likely mr @entity2 will be refused entry			2
he said : ‘ i feel that , based on my behaviour while i was in the @entity11 , what is happening to my wife and i is a great injustice			0
seat of yearning : the couple married after graduating from @entity6 in @entity12 ( file picture ) ‘ we both contributed so much to the @entity11 economy while at university and i can not understand why we are the type of people the @entity11 wants to get rid of			1
’ mr @entity55 added : ‘ during our four years in the @entity11 we each spent £ 16,000 on accommodation , each paid £ 5,000 in taxes and @entity59 and i spent £ 70,000 to attend university			0
' i feel that , based on my behaviour while i was in the @entity11 , what is happening to my wife and i is a great injustice ' @entity2 ' how a couple who has given £ 112,000 to the @entity11 economy before the age of 23 can be excluded based on financial grounds is beyond me			1
‘ i called the @entity11 my home and was looking forward to returning in january to start a life and business			0
’ mrs @entity71 , also 23 , of @entity72 , @entity73 , said : ‘ it is extremely distressing to not be able to return home to live where we once lived			0
‘ we are choosing to move to @entity3 together , where i can enter , stay and work on a specific visa while a green card is approved			0
the new laws make me extremely angry			0
’ she said it was unfair to penalise newly married couples because they do not have large savings or highly paid jobs			0
she added : ‘ we did not marry for convenience , a visa or to abuse the @entity11 benefits – we simply married for love			2
’ ' we did not marry for convenience , a visa or to abuse the @entity11 benefits – we simply married for love ' @entity71 the couple only realised they were facing a ban from entering the @entity11 after visiting the @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , during their travels			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ everyone we have spoken to in immigration refuses to help us because we do n’t “ live ” in the @entity11 , but neither will the @entity97 embassy because we do n’t live here either			1
‘ we do intend to fly back to the @entity11 on january 16 , hoping we can talk to a real human at immigration in @entity107 and deal with the issue there			0
’ if mr @entity2 is refused permission to live in the @entity11 he will have to obtain a 30 - day tourist visa			1
if that happens , he said : ‘ we will spend the next month getting @entity7 a visa to @entity3 and packing up our things			1
’ no one was available for comment last night from the @entity116 .			0

@entity3 @entity2 graduated from @entity6 in summer
the astrophysics graduate married management graduate @entity7 in october
but 23 - year - old is *unhappy* that he *'s* likely to be barred from living in @entity11
