by @entity0 it is popularly thought that @entity3 explorers colonised @entity4 in the 15th century			1
but mouse bones suggest that the @entity6 visited the island four centuries beforehand			0
scientists also believe that the mouse population that stowed away on their boats led to an ‘ ecological disaster ’ and the extinction of native birds			0
a flying visit ? mouse bones suggest that the @entity6 visited the island four centuries before @entity3 settlers colonised @entity4 in the 15th century			1
a new study indicates that mice travelled on ships ( illustrated ) and made their homes on the island @entity25 mice reached the island in the year 1036 - four centuries before the @entity3 colonisation - according to a study published in the journal proceedings of the @entity30 the discovery comes after experts dated old mouse bones found at @entity34 , to the east of the island			1
researchers from the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) in @entity40 and the @entity41 , @entity42 , analysed two samples of bones and while the first yielded no information , the second was dated to between 900 and @entity47 , which is the earliest evidence of the presence of mice on the island			1
‘ current populations of house mice on @entity4 show similarities in mitochondrial dna with those in @entity59 and northern @entity60 , but not with those in @entity3 , ’ said @entity52 of @entity53			1
experts dated old mouse bones found at @entity34 , to the east of the island ( pictured )			2
current populations of house mice on @entity4 show similarities in mitochondrial dna with those in @entity59 and northern @entity60 , but not with those in @entity3 , the researchers said this hints that the mice were neither indigenous nor hitched a ride on the ships of @entity3 settlers who took possession of the island in 1419			1
‘ the second sample analysed leads us to think that the @entity6 … [ carried ] the mice			0
’ he explained that more morphological and genetic studies of the remains are needed and there are no historical references of @entity6 travelling to the island			0
however , if the findings are correct and @entity6 did land on @entity4 long ago , they may have triggered significant ecological changes on the island			2
the researchers believe that the first human visitors began the extinction of endemic bird species on the island			2
the fast and the furriest : scientists think that the mice population the warriors brought with them led an ' ecological disaster ' and extinction of endemic birds they think the mice quickly thrived due to their reproductive potential and the lack of rats – and their predatory activity wiped out eggs and chicks of small and medium birds such as the quail and rail			0
the researchers said that least two thirds of the endemic birds and two non-endemic species became extinct , which in turn enabled predators such as owls to prosper			0
‘ the introduction of the mice probably resulted in an ecological disaster , based on the extinction of endemic birds and changing the ecology of the island four years earlier than previously thought , ’ mr @entity52 said .			0

study suggests explorers *stepped* foot on the island *400* years before the @entity3 colonisation
mouse bone discovered in the east of @entity4 dated to between 900 and @entity132 - the earliest evidence of mice on the island
@entity25 mice on @entity4 show similarities in mitochondrial dna with those in @entity59 and northern @entity60 , but not with those in @entity3
*invasion* of *germanic* mice wiped out native bird species on the island
