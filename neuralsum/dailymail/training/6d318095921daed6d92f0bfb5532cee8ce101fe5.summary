@entity1 and @entity2 users who persistently spread racial hatred online should be given ' internet @entity4 ' under proposals by @entity7 to tackle rising levels of @entity9			1
they called on the @entity10 to examine whether prevention orders similar to those which can be used to restrict sex offenders ' online access could be applied to hate crimes			2
it would mean that ' determined ' perpetrators of @entity9 online could be blocked from sites such as @entity2 and @entity1			1
the report said ' @entity25 ' and ' @entity26 ' were among the top 35 key words used on @entity1 last summer			1
highly abusive posts on the microblogging site were singled out , including the hashtag ' @entity25 was right ' , which was trending in july , as well as the ' presence of @entity25 themes and imagery on @entity2 '			1
the @entity7 ' report also called for a government fund to be established to cover the costs of security at synagogues , and for new guidance for teachers on handling the @entity51 conflict in the classroom			1
@entity53 described the report as ' hugely important ' , saying : ' tackling anti-semitism goes right to the heart of what we stand for as a country			2
' ' @entity60 is proud to be a multi-ethnic , multi-faith democracy			0
it is something we have built over generations and which generations have given their lives to defend			0
we will not weaken our resolve now but instead redouble our efforts to stand up and defend the values we believe in			0
' this report has a vital role to play			0
there can be no excuses			0
no disagreements over foreign policy or politics can ever be allowed to justify antisemitism or any other form of racism , prejudice or extremism			0
' while i am prime minister i promise we will fight antisemitism with everything we have got			0
together we will make sure @entity60 remains a country that @entity31 people are proud to call home – today , tomorrow and for every generation to come			1
' the warnings about social media sites in the @entity7 ' report comes after @entity1 chief executive @entity93 admitted they ' suck ' at dealing with abuse and so - called trolling , vowing in an internal memo to ' start kicking these people off right and left '			1
@entity53 said the report was ' hugely important ' , adding that @entity60 must remain ' a country that @entity31 people are proud to call home ' the @entity7 said : ' there is an allowance in the law for banning or blocking individuals from certain aspects of internet communication in relation to sexual offences			1
' informal feedback we have received from policy experts indicates that this is a potential area of exploration for prosecutors in relation to hate crime			2
' if it can be proven in a detailed way that someone has made a considered and determined view to exploit various online networks to harm and perpetrate hate crimes against others then the accepted principles , rules and restrictions that are relevant to sex offences must surely apply			2
' the report added : ' given the scale of social media content produced on a daily let alone minute by minute basis , we have some albeit limited sympathy for the companies that are responsible for hosting it			0
' whilst there is rightly an expectation on those companies to act as there is on government , police and prosecuting authorities , so too civil society has a crucial role to play			0
' the panel outlined measures to tackle online abuse as it called for ' urgent action ' from @entity148 , police , prosecutors and the @entity31 community to combat a ' disturbing ' rise in antisemitism			1
last week figures released by the @entity155 – a charity that monitors anti-semitism and provides security for the @entity31 community in @entity60 – showed there were a record number of anti-semitic hate incidents in the @entity60 last year			1
data from the @entity163 supplied to the panel showed that there were 306 anti-semitic incidents and 236 offences in @entity167 between april and november last year			1
the issue has come under renewed scrutiny following the @entity171 terror attacks in which a @entity31 supermarket was targeted			2
@entity174 mp @entity173 , who set up the committee , said : ' this report is a plan of action and a work programme for parliament and government			0
' it is the responsibility of parliamentarians to take the leads in this fight			0
whoever is in power ... can be on notice that we expect it to be the basis of their work programme on tackling @entity9 and the new government will be held to account on its delivery			0
