subject : suspect @entity4 could be required to submit to a ' narcoanalytic interview ' as part of an evaluation to determine if he was legally insane at the time of the july 20 shootings the prospect of such interviews that may ensue under such a plea alarmed defense attorneys , who filed documents opposing the technique			1
suspect : @entity4 is accused of killing 12 people at an @entity30 movie theater on july 20 a narcoanalylitic interview is a decades - old process in which patients are given drugs to lower their inhibition			2
academic studies have shown that the technique has involved the use of sodium amytal and pentothal , sometimes called truth serum			1
@entity4 , 25 , is scheduled to enter a plea tuesday to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder			1
he is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 70 at a midnight showing of ' @entity47 ' in the @entity49 suburb of @entity30			0
if @entity4 pleads not guilty by reason of insanity , he would be examined by doctors at the state mental hospital			1
in an advisory that @entity4 would have to sign if he enters an insanity plea , @entity10 did n't specify what type of drugs would be used but said the examination could include ' medically appropriate ' ones			1
@entity10 said @entity4 also could be given a polygraph examination as part of the evaluation			2
after reading a draft of the advisory , @entity4 ' lawyers objected , saying a narcoanalytic interview and a polygraph would violate their client 's rights			1
in the final version of the advisory , @entity10 said he had incorporated some suggestions from the defense and the prosecution , but he did not address the defense objections to a narcoanalytic interview and polygraph			0
@entity79 , a former prosecutor who is a law professor at the @entity80 and a defense attorney , said she could not find any case law about use of the narcoanalytic interview			0
' it comes up so rarely , ' she said , adding she knows nothing about it			0
she noted the technique is clearly allowed by @entity3 law			0
that hospitalization , defense lawyers noted , was separate from an earlier incident where @entity4 was treated at a hospital for injuries ' that resulted from potential self - inflicted head injuries in his cell			2
' the motion said the sheriff 's office refused to give the video to prosecutors or defense attorneys at the direction of @entity103			0
@entity104 told @entity105 on friday night that he had released a ' relevant video to both sides , ' but citing a gag order imposed by the judge in the case , declined to comment on its contents			0
@entity104 said his office had been ' straightforward and cooperative ' in the case , and that he would not release the hospital video because it was taken outside his jurisdiction			0
in the dock : @entity3 shooter @entity4 appears confused while making his first court appearance at the @entity103 on july 23 memorial : tributes are left for victims near the scene of the tragedy in @entity3 that claimed 12 lives ' i told them ( attorneys ) that i did n't have the authority to give them that video because it was taken in @entity49 and they 'd have to go through them , ' he said			2
in rejecting the defense motion to declare @entity3 's insanity defense law unconstitutional , @entity10 said defense lawyers had raised the issue prematurely since @entity4 had yet to enter a plea , and prosecutors had not indicated whether they would seek the death penalty			1
lawyers for @entity4 last week challenged the constitutionality of a @entity3 statute that requires a defendant who raises an insanity defense to submit to examinations by court - appointed psychiatrists			2
defense lawyers argued that the law , which would compel @entity4 to provide potentially damaging information that could be used against him at trial , or at sentencing should he be convicted , violated his @entity154 guarantee of protection against self - incrimination			0
paying respects : people visit a memorial for the victims in the shooting across the street from the @entity164 movie theater in @entity30 two days after the shootings			0
