it seems the @entity2 boys have another hit on their hands			1
but it 's their perfume that 's setting the tills ringing this time , their scent , our moment , launched at @entity12 on august 25 and is set to earn the boys over £ 360,000 in its first week on sale in the @entity15 , according to beauty and fragrance experts			1
the six - figure sum is calculated from pre-orders plus sales of over 3,000 bottles at @entity12 in @entity22 in just two days			2
sweet smell of success : the @entity2 boys appear fixated by their perfume in a still from the advert for the scent @entity28 ceo @entity27 said : ' our moment is predicted to sell around 180,000 units in the first week alone , making it one of the fastest selling fragrances of all time			1
loadsamoney : @entity36 withdraws some of the pots of cash he has earned this week ' it ’s certainly looking like it ’s going to be the most successful celebrity perfume launch of the year and sales in @entity43 are expected to be bigger still , ' says @entity27			2
on the basis of 180,000 sales of the most popular 30ml @entity47 , which retails at £ 19.99 , the turnover for the first week will come in at nearly £ 3.6m			1
although the exact deal that the @entity52 boy band struck with the perfume company is closely guarded secret , most industry insiders have estimated that @entity36 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 will personally earn around £ 2 for every 30ml @entity47 bottle sold , which means the group is due to bank £ 360,000 in 7 days			1

winning ! @entity56 , @entity55 , @entity71 , @entity36 of @entity2 at the @entity72 last week ' with such an interest we made the decision that our moment will need its own warehouse to help keep up with demand for what looks to be the biggest celebrity launch of 2013			0
' ' i found our moment very sweet and a tad too heavy for daytime for grown - ups - and even an hour after first spraying this , the smell still lingered over me like a huge cloud of frangipani and candyfloss			0
i have nothing against frangipani , it 's just combined with everything else that the overall effect is a bit cloying			0
' @entity95 other products and gift sets are to be added to the range in the next month , just in time for the @entity100 market which accounts for around 70 per cent of annual fragrance sales , and the boys are expected to earn around £ 2m from perfume sales over the festive season			1
@entity28 boss @entity27 said : ' i would anticipate turnover will top £ 10m for the range over @entity100 - which would see @entity2 around £ 2m richer by the end of the festive season , just from @entity15 perfume sales			1
' with such hysteria surrounding the launch , it 's almost immaterial what it actually smells like			0
fans are buying into their favourite band , not following their noses			0
check out our beauty expert 's verdict in the box , right			0
only time will tell whether it can beat the best - selling celebrity fragrance of all time , @entity124 by the late @entity125 - the scent brought in $ 75 million at retail in 2011 , according to @entity128			0
