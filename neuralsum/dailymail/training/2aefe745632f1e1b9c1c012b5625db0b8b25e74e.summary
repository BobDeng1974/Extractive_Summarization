@entity1 giant killers @entity2 are set to be snubbed by the @entity3 for a second time after opting against showing their quarter - final tie against @entity7 live			1
the corporation came in for criticism after it chose to air @entity11 's fifth round tie with @entity12 rather than the @entity15 side 's 2 - 0 win against @entity17 opposition @entity16 at @entity18 on sunday			1
and despite that decision causing such a stir , which led to @entity2 supporters chanting ' are you watching @entity3 ' and goalscorer @entity23 insisting the game ' should have been on tv ' during his post-match interview , the @entity3 are risking further backlash by ignoring the club once more , according to the @entity30 's @entity29			1
@entity31 ( centre ) fires @entity2 ahead against @entity16 as they set up @entity1 quarter - final @entity23 ( right ) seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the @entity1 fifth round giant killing the @entity3 had first and third pick of the last - eight ties and understandably plumped for @entity41 's clash with @entity42 at @entity43 as first choice			1
@entity45 , who are sharing @entity1 coverage with the @entity3 , opted to show @entity48 against @entity49 as their first pick , and the @entity3 have controversially ignored @entity2 's match in favour of the @entity54 derby between @entity11 and @entity55			1
@entity57 presenter @entity56 on sunday night moved to clarify why the @entity3 had not shown @entity2 's win over @entity16			1
' i do have an answer on that subject , ' the presenter said			0
' and it comes from the @entity3 football management who say the following : " they had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore could nâ€™t be sure who @entity2 would be at home to			1
if they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it "			0
' @entity56 said that the @entity3 had to choose the live games before @entity2 's opponents were known @entity23 joked during his post-match interview that the tie against @entity16 should have been shown on tv @entity79 and @entity56 were subject to a cheeky tweet from @entity2 following their @entity1 win @entity16 needed a replay to beat @entity84 side @entity83 in the fourth round and the @entity3 had to select the live games before the tie was decided , with the corporation instead opting to show the all @entity17 clash between @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity79 had earlier claimed the @entity3 would have screened @entity2 's fifth - round clash had their opponents been known prior to the fourth - round replays			1
the @entity3 later released a statement explaining how the selection process for the @entity1 ties works			1
the tv match selections for the 5th round of the @entity1 caused a bit of a reaction yesterday , so i wanted to use this post to explain in a bit more detail how the selection process works			2
you still might not agree with our picks , particularly if you 're from @entity2 , but hopefully you 'll see there 's a bit of logic to what we try to do			2
as @entity79 mentioned yesterday , the hardest thing is that both the @entity3 and @entity45 have to make our selections before the outcome of replays			2
that 's the only reason why @entity117 's side did n't get a live match this time round			2
we had to weigh up the options and given @entity16 's recent form , thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being @entity15 against a @entity84 side			1
in this case it would n't have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live quarter - final , as @entity7 have done by progressing at @entity130			1
if @entity2 definitely had a home tie against @entity17 opposition we certainly would have chosen to have the match live on @entity3			1
that has been a big part of our policy so far , showing @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and tonight @entity139 , all looking to overcome opposition from the top flight			0
as the game unfolded yesterday at @entity18 , we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live			0
it 's everything the @entity1 and our new comprehensive coverage is about			2
we are speaking to the fa about whether we can change this in the future , but understand it 's tricky for them			0
clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing , policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for tv companies to confirm their selections			0
but we hope there 's a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday			0
of course a lot of things are easy in hindsight			0
we have been really pleased with most of our picks so far and really fortunate to get some proper cup shocks			0
@entity170 from the eighth tier overcoming @entity172 , @entity173 winning in dramatic fashion at @entity175 , @entity136 running @entity48 close and @entity137 holding @entity41 under the @entity178 lights			0
it 's also great to see the difference the tv money can make to these clubs , as well as placing them in the national spotlight with over 7 million viewers tuning in			2
our audience research also suggests that fans want to enjoy a mix of these @entity190 matches and games involving @entity17 sides			0
for those who ca n't afford subscription to sports channels , it 's been great to be able to see live international stars like @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 , all as part of the licence fee			0
while the @entity11 vs. @entity12 game was n't everyone 's cup of tea , it was a hotly contested @entity54 derby with both clubs picking full strength sides and produced a cracking second half watched by over 4 million			0
of course , we would have loved to have been live at @entity214 in the 4th round and @entity2 in the 5th , but the good news for fans is that even when a game is n't shown live there 's always comprehensive @entity57 highlights available			2
there 's a lot more extra coverage devoted to the @entity1 on the @entity3 , with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it			1
after the 4th round , 26 million people had watched the coverage on the @entity3 , that 's 8 million more than on terrestrial tv this time last season			2
it 's not all about viewing figures and ratings , but it 's pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world 's most loved cup competition to such a wide audience			0
despite some of the criticism coming out of @entity2 , a lot of thought goes into the matches we pick , and i hope the selections outlined above show we are particularly keen to showcase clubs outside the @entity17			0
i 'm a @entity250 fan myself so know all too well what the cup can mean to those outside the elite			0
when we sit down tomorrow morning to pick our two matches for the quarter - final we will take all i 've discussed into consideration , but the good news is that all four matches will be live on tv			1
that means @entity2 's incredible heroics over the last five rounds have guaranteed them a money - spinning quarter - final game and boy do @entity269 fans deserve it !			1

@entity2 were drawn against @entity7 in the @entity1 quarter - final
@entity2 beat @entity16 2 - 0 to reach the last eight of the *tournament*
the @entity3 were criticised for not showing the giant killing live on tv
and the corporation are set to snub the @entity15 side 's quarter - final
