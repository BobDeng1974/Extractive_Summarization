a pair of 17 - year - old schoolboys and a 19 - year - old man were intercepted in @entity10 after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group			1
they dialled 999 and @entity1 police quickly tipped off their @entity10 counterparts			1

three @entity1 teenagers who were stopped in @entity10 while allegedly on their way to @entity6 to join the @entity5 are now back in the @entity1 , police say the three were brought back to @entity1 where they were questioned at a high - security @entity24 police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism			1
but last night they were released on bail			2
a @entity29 spokesman said : ‘ they have been bailed to return to a central @entity24 police station pending further inquiries			1
’ investigators hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so			2
the case highlights the difficult balancing act the security services face in dealing with would - be jihadists desperate to sign up to the militant @entity40 cause			2
security chiefs are increasingly desperate to get into often closed communities and understand what is attracting our young people to such a barbaric organisation			0
yet criminal suspects are unlikely to talk freely about their motivation or reveal the identities of other potential militants			0
last week @entity52 chief sir @entity51 said the three schoolgirls who fled to @entity6 from @entity24 would not face prosecution if they came home			1
this is despite the fact they successfully reached @entity59 and at least two of them are known to have communicated with wanted terrorists			0

sources in @entity10 said there is some evidence the three communicated with terrorists about how best to evade the authorities			1
none of them are believed to be connected to any high - profile is terrorists			2

they include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months , many of whom wanted to become ‘ jihadi brides ’			0
@entity59 controls huge areas of the two countries and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause			0
@entity10 has faced criticism for not controlling its border with @entity6 , but has accused @entity116 states of failing to prevent would - be jihadists from leaving in the first place			1
it comes just weeks after an international police hunt was launched to find three @entity24 schoolgirls who travelled to @entity18 on their journey to @entity6 on the run : ( l to r ) @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 paid for their flights out of the @entity1 after stealing jewellery from their family			1
they are understood to be in the @entity65 stronghold of @entity133 friday ’s dramatic operation came only weeks after the three runaway @entity1 schoolgirls flew to @entity10 before travelling overland to @entity6			1
the families of @entity123 and @entity122 , both 15 , and @entity124 , 16 , have lashed out at police and others for failing to stop them			0
but their plight has raised questions about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical @entity145			0
on saturday the @entity146 revealed the identity of another girl , a close friend of the trio , who left @entity1 before them in december			2
@entity151 , 15 , disappeared from @entity152 and flew to @entity18 from @entity153			2
those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by @entity145 using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software			0
there are also suspicions the trio kept in touch with @entity151 who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps			0
the schoolgirls are understood to be in the terror group ’s de facto capital @entity133			0
the authorities in @entity10 said the quick deportation of the latest travellers showed how their efforts to combat the flood of extremists is working			1
one source said : ‘ the @entity10 are willing to act quickly and arrest people but they do not see this as their problem			1
that is why the suspects were sent back to the @entity1 so quickly			1
no one here wants to deal with them any longer than they have to			0

@entity151 ’s father , @entity193 , 38 , said a high - profile appeal for information might have helped find his daughter before she reached @entity6			2
mr @entity193 said : ‘ maybe a police appeal could have helped			0
the police just told me , “ @entity199 are doing their best to find her ”			0
then after three days they told me they maybe could n’t do any more			0
