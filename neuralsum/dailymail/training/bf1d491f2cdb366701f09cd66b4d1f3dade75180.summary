local councils are wasting £ 200million a year because they insist on using bins of different sizes and colours , according to a study on recycling			1
if @entity8 ’s 406 local authorities agreed on a common waste collection strategy they could save a quarter of the cost of buying bins – simply by purchasing in bulk			1
each bin costs an average of £ 20 , around £ 5 more than it would in @entity15 where there is a single rubbish strategy across the country			1
disjointed : this graphic illustrates how one council - @entity20 - uses nine different types of bin			0
this contrasts to @entity15 where bins are standardised across the country			1
the study by the @entity28 , a think tank , said : ‘ in @entity15 , all bins are the same			1
the high volume makes the unit cost cheap			0
‘ in the @entity8 , few local authorities jointly purchase bins , and many insist on expressing local preferences through bin colour , embossed logos and the like			1
’ researchers found that out of a sample of 40 councils , only two had co-operated on purchasing wheelie bins			1
they also found big differences in recycling policies			0
some councils collect plastic food packaging , for example , while others do not , some insist that items are separated into different bins while others collect all recyclable waste in the same bag			2
the report said that the failure to co-ordinate recycling was partly responsible for the lack of progress in improving recycling rates , which rose by just 0.2 percentage points to 43.2 per cent in @entity62 between 2012 and 2013			2
inefficient : a @entity64 graphic showing how @entity8 is wasting money by opting for a variety of bins waste : overall , the @entity8 is losing £ 1.7billion a year from disjointed and outdated measures for recycling overall , the @entity8 is losing £ 1.7billion a year from disjointed and outdated measures for recycling waste food , plastics and electronic items , the study said			1
council tax could be reduced by £ 61 per household per year if authorities improved their collection systems and stopped sending recyclable plastics , electronic items and food to landfill , it calculated			2
the report , called @entity84 , said : ‘ devolving power and making councils accountable to their citizens is surely a good thing			2
but insisting on local difference without sufficient information about where this creates perverse outcomes means that citizens can not hold politicians to account			0
’ @entity96 , co-author of the report , added : ‘ valuable raw materials are lost while businesses are frustrated by a lack of usable recycled materials			0
‘ the system both stymies demand for recycled materials and prevents businesses investing			0
‘ the problem is structural			0
the government could easily turn this around by reforming the system to help businesses get the @entity8 moving toward a circular economy			2
’ rubbish : @entity8 councils ’ disjointed approach to purchasing bins is costing the taxpayer £ 200million a year the report follows the announcement last week that families in @entity119 , @entity120 , will only have their household rubbish collected once every three weeks in a bid to cut costs yesterday a @entity107 spokesman said : ‘ the amount of household waste recycled , composted and reused is almost four times what it was in 2000 , but there is still more to do			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity131 added : ‘ the types of bin which would suit a detached five - bedroom house in the country would be completely unsuitable for a 20 - storey block of flats in inner - city @entity138 and vice versa			0
‘ councils have to take account of the types of homes in their areas when they plan the frequency of waste and recycling collections and the size and type of container is a key part of this			0
’ ‘ there is no one - size - fits - all solution to bin collections and decisions are best made at a local level			0

@entity8 councils opt for differently designed bins instead of a standard model
in @entity15 all bins are one design and cost £ 5 less to purchase as a result
the *muddled* @entity8 approach costs the taxpayer £ 200m a year , a report says
it warns the @entity8 is losing £ 1.7bn a year from disjointed recycling measures
