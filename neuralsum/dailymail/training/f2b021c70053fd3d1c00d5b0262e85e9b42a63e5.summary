@entity20 , head of coins and medals at @entity11 , said : ' although the coin is quite rare and in good condition , we are slightly bewildered that it went for quite so much			2
' there was a real frenzy at the auction with six people in the room and four more on the phones all wanting the coin			1
' the @entity35 in the 1790s was not the country it is now , and so the amount of cents produced would have been relatively few			0
a highly competitive auction at @entity11 in @entity40 , @entity12 drove up the price to more than 30 times the expected sale price in 1792 @entity43 called for the establishment of a national mint			2
