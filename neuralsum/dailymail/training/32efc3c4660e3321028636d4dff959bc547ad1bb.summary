by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's historic progression to the last - 16 of the @entity4 was somewhat marred on thursday night , as riots broke out on the streets of @entity7			2
@entity9 's side went up against @entity10 in what was effectively a knockout game from @entity13 , and a 1 - 1 draw secured their passage to the second round for the first time in their history			1
@entity10 had taken the lead through a sixth - minute @entity22 header , but the @entity24 side wrestled their way back into the match , equalising on the hour through @entity27			0
riots : @entity3 fans causing problems on the streets of @entity7 following their @entity4 win hysteria : things get heated after @entity3 's qualification for the last - 16 historic : they will play @entity38 in the second round of the competition riding high : two fans sitting atop a street sign as the riot continues beneath them waving flag : it is the first time in history that @entity3 have made it past the @entity4 group stage unfortunately , the it led to the rather unsavoury scenes in the @entity52 city , which has a huge @entity54 population			1
the result meant that , after four attempts , they finally made it out of the @entity4 group stage , which is an even more impressive feat considering they failed to even score in @entity61 four years ago - only managing to get a point off a woeful @entity64 side ( also managed by @entity65 )			0
@entity3 will now play @entity38 in the last - 16 , where they will look to gain revenge for the infamous controversy surrounding their exit in 1982 - when @entity38 and @entity72 played out a 1 - 0 victory to ensure that both teams would qualify			0
triumph : the night started as a celebration but things quickly started to get out of hand national pride : there is a vast @entity54 population in the southern city on patrol : @entity52 police out in force on the streets of @entity7 fire starter : @entity52 police taking positions to try and calm things down			2

@entity3 secured qualification to the second round of @entity4 on thursday
but the victory was marred by riots on the streets of @entity7 in @entity52 , where there is a large @entity54 population
1 - 1 draw with @entity10 left them second in @entity13 on four points
first time in their history they have made it out of the group stage
