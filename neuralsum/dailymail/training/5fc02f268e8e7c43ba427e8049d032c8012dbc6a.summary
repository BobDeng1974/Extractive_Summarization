@entity1 legend @entity0 will break a @entity3 record when he makes his 143rd appearance in the competition against @entity6 on tuesday night			1
the 34 - year - old midfielder will surpass former @entity9 icon @entity8 , with whom he is currently level on 142 appearances			1
former @entity13 winger @entity12 made 151 appearances , but 10 of those were in qualifying rounds			1
having won @entity18 's most prestigious club competition three times with @entity1 , he deserves to be considered one of @entity3 's all - time greats			1
here is our list of the top 10 @entity3 players ( and there 's no room for @entity28 )			2
@entity8 - 142 @entity0 - 142 @entity12 - 141 @entity29 - 141 @entity30 - 125 @entity12 - 151 @entity0 - 148 @entity31 @entity29 -143 @entity32 - 140 10 : @entity33 ( @entity34 and @entity13 ) winner : 1995 , 2008 @entity33 was the calm , unflappable figure in goal when @entity40 's extremely young @entity34 side caused the biggest upset in the competition 's history by overcoming the mighty holders @entity44			1
more than a decade later , the goalkeeper 's place in @entity3 history was assured when he saved @entity49 's spot - kick in @entity50 to earn @entity13 their third @entity52 crown with victory against @entity54			2
fittingly , @entity33 's illustrious career ended with a @entity3 final , though this time he was helpless to prevent @entity13 from losing 3 - 1 to @entity1 at @entity57 in 2011			1
@entity33 won the @entity3 with @entity34 in 1995 and @entity13 in 2008 the @entity58 saved a decisive penalty from @entity49 in the 2008 @entity3 final 9 : @entity30 ( @entity34 , @entity9 and @entity44 ) winner : 1995 , 1998 , 2003 and 2007 the only player to win the @entity3 with three different clubs , @entity30 was the midfield glue that helped some of the world 's greatest players get their hands on the famous trophy			2
the @entity58 was just 19 when he helped @entity34 beat @entity44 in 1995			0
three years later , he helped @entity9 end a 32 - year wait for @entity52 glory by beating @entity72 1 - 0			1
but it was at @entity44 that he enjoyed his greatest successes			0
he was part of the side that defeated @entity72 on penalties at @entity78 when @entity79 converted the decisive kick and , after losing to @entity81 in 2005 ( more of which later in the countdown ) , he won a fourth title by defeating the same opponents 2 - 1 in 2007			0
@entity30 lifts the @entity3 after @entity44 's win over @entity81 in the 2007 final @entity30 is the only man to win the @entity3 with three different clubs 8 : @entity29 ( @entity9 ) winner : 2000 , 2002 , 2014 he may be receiving criticism in the latter stages of his career but nobody can deny @entity29 in his place among the all - time greats			2
to win three @entity3 trophies , spanning 14 years , is an incredible achievement and it might be a long time before anyone repeats it			0
and of course he 's still going			0
the @entity100 was just four days past his 19th birthday , extremely young for a top - class goalkeeper , when he kept a clean sheet in the 2000 final against @entity105			0
he was one of the few to survive into the @entity108 era , keeping goal when @entity28 memorably won the 2002 final , and then went beyond the @entity112 era and played in last may 's 4 - 1 win against @entity114 for @entity115			0
a young @entity29 ( right ) as part of @entity9 's @entity3 winners in 2002 at @entity118 @entity29 kisses the trophy after @entity9 's win over @entity114 in the 2014 final in @entity122 7 : @entity123 ( @entity81 ) winner : 2005 @entity123 has n't got the multiple medals of others in the top 10 , but none of them have dominated a final like he did in 2005 , when his man - of - the - match performance helped create the miracle of @entity133 , a match so famous it 's been turned into a film			1
with @entity81 3 - 0 down at half - time to @entity44 , @entity123 scored the opening goal of a miraculous comeback with his head , and ended up playing at right back to ensure his side , far weaker than the @entity142 man - for - man , reached extra-time and penalties			0
previously , @entity81 had only qualified for the knockout stages after his thunderous late strike against @entity148 at @entity149 had staved off elimination			0
and he is still doing the business now , his last - minute penalty against @entity152 gave @entity81 victory in their opening group game of the 2014 campaign two weeks ago			0
@entity123 ( right ) and @entity157 ( left ) kiss the trophy after a miraculous win in @entity133 gerrard scores arguably his most famous goal against @entity148 at @entity149 in 2004 the @entity81 captain 's goal four minutes from time took his side through to the knock - out stages 6 : @entity0 ( @entity1 ) winner : 2006 , 2009 , 2011 despite the spellbinding feats of @entity168 and @entity169 , this period of world football will be go down as the @entity173 era , where they helped @entity1 and @entity175 dominate with a passing philosophy known as ' tiki - taka '			1
@entity0 was an unused substitute when @entity1 beat @entity178 in the 2006 final but three years later he was an integral part of their midfield in the defeat of @entity13 that prompted @entity169 's exodus to @entity175			1
in 2011 , he was majestic as the @entity183 again got the better of sir @entity185 's side			0
now 34 , @entity0 's consistency , both in terms of keeping the ball and producing season - on - season , are unsurpassed and he will be a worthy record - breaker when he plays his 143rd @entity3 game			1
@entity0 has won the @entity3 with @entity1 three times - in 2006 , 2009 and 2011 @entity0 skippered @entity1 and ran the midfield in the 2011 final victory against @entity13 5 : @entity8 ( @entity9 and @entity194 ) winner : 1998 , 2000 , 2002 holds the record for most goals and appearances in the @entity3 , though the latter is about to be eclipsed by @entity0			1
@entity8 was the @entity200 as they recaptured the glory years of @entity203 and @entity204 when the competition was called the @entity3			1
he won the trophy three times in five years against @entity72 , @entity105 and @entity207 , the highlight coming at @entity118 in 2002 when he scored the opening goal against the @entity212 side in a match ultimately won by @entity28 's stupendous volley			0
@entity9 legend @entity8 is the top scorer in @entity3 history with 71 goals to his name 4 : @entity12 ( @entity13 ) winner : 1999 , 2008 the only @entity13 player who appeared in both finals of sir @entity185 's @entity3 - winning teams			1
in 1999 against @entity222 , he unselfishly played on the right - hand side to accommodate the left - sided @entity224 in a @entity13 reshuffle forced by suspension to @entity227 and @entity228			0
nine years later against @entity54 in @entity50 , @entity12 converted @entity13 's last penalty in the shoot - out that preceded @entity49 's crucial miss. @entity12 has played more @entity3 game than anyone else if you include qualifying rounds ( 148 ) , but it 's as much to do with respect as statistics that he commands a place in the top 10			1
the @entity242 has become a byword around @entity18 for sportsmanship , as another @entity13 great sir @entity245 was before him , a reputation underlined when he was applauded by @entity9 fans in the heat of a tense battle			0
@entity12 was part of @entity13 's @entity3 winning teams in 2008 ( left ) and 1999 ( right ) 3 : @entity169 ( @entity13 and @entity9 ) winner : 2008 , 2014 scored in victorious finals for two different clubs – and ended up being crowned @entity254 on both occasions			1
@entity169 's header for @entity13 against @entity54 in the 2008 final changed any perception that he was a flat - track bully and unable to produce on the big occasions			0
six years later , he was the talisman as @entity9 won a record 10th @entity3 against @entity114 in @entity122			2
he already has 68 @entity3 goals , three behind @entity8 's record , and as he has n't yet turned 30 it is only a matter of time when he passes that milestone , though @entity168 is also breathing down his neck on 67			1
@entity169 celebrates his goal against @entity114 to help @entity9 win ' @entity115 ' the @entity271 superstar also scored in @entity13 's 2008 victory against @entity54 in @entity50 2 : @entity32 ( @entity44 ) winner : 1994 , 2003 , 2007 played in no fewer than six @entity3 finals – and also won the @entity3 twice in the 1980s before the competition changed format			2
the ultimate @entity142 defender , tough and resilient , @entity32 's finest hour came in 1994 when @entity44 produced arguably the best performance in tournament history by thrashing @entity1 4 - 0 without their first - choice centre - back pairing of @entity282 and @entity283			2
as captain , @entity32 also helped @entity44 recover from the shock of losing a 3 - 0 lead to @entity81 in @entity133 – where he scored the opening goal - to beat the same opponents in the 2007 final			0
@entity32 has won the @entity3 three times , but also won two @entity52 cups in the 1980s 1 : @entity168 ( @entity1 ) winner : 2009 , 2011 on course to smash all @entity3 scoring records			1
@entity168 has already hit 67 , four fewer than @entity8 and one behind @entity169 ; but at the age of 27 he could become the first player to net a century of @entity3 goals			1
in the biggest head - to - head between the world 's two best players , @entity168 completely outplayed @entity169 when @entity1 met @entity13 in the 2009 final in @entity303			2
he even scored with a rare header from @entity0 's cross			0
two years later , he scored again when @entity1 beat @entity13 3 - 1 at @entity57 , their ultimate @entity52 performance			2
but the reason @entity168 is marginally ahead of all the other great players listed is because of the way he has transcended the sport with his brand of magic			0
the @entity313 has the quickest feet in the history of the game and is the figure that has given the @entity3 its own sense of excitement			0
he may not have won the @entity321 like @entity322 , but @entity322 never won the @entity3 and @entity168 has helped make the @entity3 the glamorous institution it is today			2
that is why he is no 1			0
like @entity327 's facebook page			0
@entity168 has won the @entity3 three times already with @entity1 at the age of 27 @entity168 , scoring a header against @entity13 in the 2009 final , is closing in on @entity8 's record for most cl goals			1

@entity0 set for 143rd appearance in @entity3
@entity1 midfielder currently tied with @entity8 on 142
34 - year - old @entity0 has won @entity3 three times with @entity1
@entity12 has made 151 appearances , but 10 of those in qualifying
