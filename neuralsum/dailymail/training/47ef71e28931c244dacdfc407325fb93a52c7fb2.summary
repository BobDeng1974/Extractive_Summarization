it 's the most talked - about show on tv that 's transformed a handful of lucky youngsters from budding singers to fully - fledged x factor stars			1
while they may look a million dollars when they grace our tv screens , behind the scenes a highly trained glam squad works like a well - oiled machine to ensure that each and every contestant is @entity15 - ready before their performances			2
@entity17 went backstage at @entity18 to meet super stylist @entity19 and hair styling heavyweight @entity20 to discover to secrets behind the singers ' transformations			1
backstage beauty : @entity17 went backstage to the @entity26 hair salon where @entity20 worked his magic on @entity29 ' hair amidst the madness - and away from the prying eyes of @entity32 - the @entity26 hair salon is a tranquil haven of calm			1
the salon is headed up by @entity20 , who arrives at the studios at 9am , and has between 10 and 45 minutes to work his magic on the singers ' hair			1
' the contestants are always being pulled from pillar to post but everyone loves coming into the hair salon , ' @entity20 told us			1
' everyone says it 's the fun room , they speak to us more than anyone			2
' so close have they become to him that when they film their @entity50 every week speaking about the show , they 're talking to @entity20 - even though you ca n't see him on camera			1
fun times : @entity20 says that the hair salon is the most fun place to be in the studios and the contestants often open up to him about how they 're feeling get the look : @entity20 says he 's been championing sleek ponytails , dishevelled party hair and lots of messy plait braids for the girls and the classic quiff for the boys - all modelled by only the @entity67 so where does it all begin and how do the contestants ' looks materialise from bed hair to beautiful bouffants ? before the shows kick off , @entity20 meets with the contestants and asks them two questions : ' what 's the worst thing i could do to your hair and what 's the best thing ? ' ' i 'm not into making people cry , ' he joked			1
' when we first did @entity86 from @entity87 she hated the colour so we coloured it back			0
hair is always hero , it 's the main accessory you wear 24/7 , you ca n't take it off like makeup			1
not a fan : the team did @entity96 's hair slightly straighter but @entity32 did n't like it so they had to make it curly again ' the happier the contestants are , the better it is			1
if @entity32 loves it and they hate it , it 's no good			2
they have to feel great			0
' every tuesday @entity20 meets with the creative heads and the judges to brainstorm ideas for the coming weekend 's show			1
' the first year , i had to present mood boards but i 've been working on the show for four years so they trust me now , ' he said			0
while he says that @entity113 and @entity114 are ' great ' and let him do what he wants , he has come under fire from @entity32			0
' this is the third week and there 's been one @entity32 wobble			1
we did @entity122 's hair slightly straighter but @entity32 did n't like it so we had to change it back , ' he said			1
' i think this year is different because @entity32 's back and because he is the big boss , everyone 's a little more on edge			2
' one contestant who has really noticed @entity32 's wrath is @entity29			1
speaking after the show - and after @entity32 predicted she would be in the bottom two - @entity29 told @entity131 : ' i think i was an emotional wreck but i sort of like hearing the negative comments because it makes you all the more determined			1
' even hearing @entity32 say i could be in the bottom two made me want to come out fighting			0
' speaking about saturday night 's performance , she said : ' i had a complete nightmare , i was terrible			2
in the rehearsal my voice went and i was panicking because i was n't in control of it ; that was the main issue and it was just horrible			0
' one thing that 's helping boost her on - stage confidence is her glam squad			1
speaking about her transformation and style haul , she said : ' my hair and what i 'm wearing make me feel so much more confident			2
i love wearing pencil skirts on the show , they definitely help me			0
on @entity158 factor , i am way more confident and everyone is being really nice about my look and it 's all thanks to @entity20 and @entity19			1
' before and after : @entity29 has become very close to @entity20 and his team and says her hair and style makes her feel far more confident on stage @entity20 , who works alongside his hairdresser wife backstage , says he 's been championing sleek ponytails , dishevelled party hair and lots of messy plait braids for the girls and the classic quiff for the boys			1
in fact , it 's the boys who are the most obsessed with how they look			1
' every year the boys are ten times worse than the girls , ' explains @entity20			1
' we 'll style them at 11am and they 'll be back at 12 asking for more hairspray			2
i 've banned the use of hairspray until an hour before the show			2
we get through fifteen cans a week - just on the boys			1
' sharing his tips and tricks , he explains how he ' uses things in a non conventional way			2
' we generate a lot of static in our hands but if you spray the hair and they use the corners of the can to smooth it down and dry it with a hairdryer , it works well			0
plus , dust in braids is a godsend			0
' style guru : @entity19 has worked with @entity208 in the past and is honoured to be styling this year 's @entity18 contestants fresh from this weekend 's show , @entity20 is already planning big things for next weekend - and he is seriously excited			1
' next week is going to be incredible , i 'd say the most fun show i 've ever worked on in four years			0
it 's @entity217 and it 's going to be the most @entity218 the show has ever been , they 're going all out			0
' @entity18 may be a singing competition but whether they like it or not , the contestants are also judged on what they 're wearing			0
but they do n't just throw on any old thing before they take to the stage ; their whole look is carefully constructed with the help of a team of style gurus backstage			0
heading up the style squad is @entity19 , who has worked with the likes of @entity208 , and helps curate each and every look for the live shows			1
@entity17 were keen to find out the entire dressing process , who her favourite judge is and how she copes with @entity32 's criticism so we grilled the stylist on all things @entity18			1
@entity19 believes that fashion is an ' emotional tool ' and if you look good , you feel good			1
' it 's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant 's heads , ' she said			2
' it is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so i want that to be translated in what they 're wearing			0
' she could n't be happier with the group , who make her job all the more enjoyable			0
' the contestants really are an amazing group , all very polite and from the beginning we have set a mutual understanding and respect			0
' as well as the contestants , @entity19 works closely with the judges to discuss how they think their acts should dress for the live shows and she hugely admires both @entity113 and @entity114 's style			1
she said : ' the girls are gorgeous , they ooze glamour and go for the less is more look with block colours and clean lines			0
' @entity114 's make - up is exquisite but i simply could n't choose between the two as they 're both equally distinctive and stunning			2
' the @entity278 , @entity20 , says : ‘ this week we toned down @entity280 ’s ombrè colour with a full head of highlights			1
her look this week is inspired by fairytale princesses but we ’ve given the classic braid a modern twist to keep her look youthful and playful			2
’ step 1 : prep hair with @entity289 and @entity290 ( @entity291 £ 4.99 ) and @entity292 ( @entity291 £ 4.99 )			0
apply @entity293 ( @entity291 £ 4.00 ) onto towel dried hair , working product through from roots to ends whilst blow drying			0
step 2 : divide hair into 2 - 3 inch diagonal sections , adding hair as you go , keeping the braids the same width , repeat three times			2
dust with @entity307 ( @entity291 £ 5.50 ) for ultimate root lift and texture			0
secure with pins and tease with fingertips for added volume and thickness			0
step 3 : tong the ends using a medium wand and spritz with @entity317 ( @entity291 £ 4.99 ) to secure in place in action : @entity280 's look was inspired by fairytale princesses but @entity20 gave the classic braid a modern twist to keep her look youthful and playful x factor judge @entity325 's lavish diamond jewellery was so valuable she reportedly was n't allowed to wear it outside the tv studios			1
bling bling : @entity113 wore dazzling diamonds , combined with a chic black @entity332 floor - length gown the tv star looked stunning on saturday 's show in dazzling diamonds , combined with a chic black @entity332 floor - length gown			2
jeweller to the stars @entity337 revealed it would simply be too dangerous for an a-list star like @entity113 to wear such expensive jewels outside a safe environment			0
he said : ' @entity113 totally stole the show on saturday with her stunning diamonds			0
she really showed how you can stand - out by wearing some breath - taking creations			0
' but the @entity113 look does not come cheap and there are obvious security concerns if you wear diamonds of that quality outside the very safest places			0
' @entity113 very sensibly took off her diamond necklace and cuff before leaving the studios on saturday			0
' i imagine her security insisted upon it , though she kept on her £ 15,000 diamond earrings			0
' the singer wore @entity363 10th @entity362 , which costs £ 380,000 and @entity365 10th @entity364 , which costs £ 65,000 .			0
