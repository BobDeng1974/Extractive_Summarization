by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell and @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity4 ’s internal investigation into suspended coaches @entity6 and @entity7 will be centred on allegations of bullying			1
their behaviour at the club ’s @entity12 training ground is believed to have led to complaints being made by staff			2
@entity6 often takes over training from manager @entity17 and several players have grievances about his ‘ aggressive ’ methods			1
reports also suggest @entity43 has been left disappointed but his omission from the @entity38 team was explained by illness			2
both returned to the starting line - up for the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity50			0
despite the club ’s official statement indicating they have only been suspended , it is understood assistant manager @entity6 and head of footballing operations @entity7 have no future at the club			1
they each have a year remaining on deals but if found guilty of serious misconduct could be sacked without a pay - off			0
the atmosphere at @entity4 ’s training ground has been described as ‘ poisonous ’ and @entity6 is said to have fallen out with other members of the backroom team and senior players			1
he also exchanged angry words with fans after the @entity70 defeat by @entity22 at @entity71			0
under pressure : @entity17 's @entity4 side have lost seven out of their past 10 @entity31 matches upset : @entity35 was thought to have been affected by an incident during training disappointed : @entity43 was left out against @entity38 but returned in the defeat at @entity22 the defender started his career at @entity79 in 1982 but is best remembered for his time at @entity28			1
during nine years at @entity81 he played 370 times for the club , including in the famous win over @entity85			0
he is in the @entity86			0
he then moved on to @entity87 and @entity88 and after a spell youth coaching at various clubs became @entity17 's assistant at @entity92 in 2008 before following the @entity93 to @entity28 and then to @entity71			1
@entity7 is said to have had a turbulent relationship with members of staff at @entity4 , too and the pair were suspended by chief executive @entity33 after @entity17 decided the make - up of his coaching team was no longer fit for purpose			1
training this week has been described as having ‘ the best atmosphere in ages ’ in the duo ’s absence			0
previously , some players were said to be confused by an insistence on long - ball tactics during sessions , while the schedule has been regularly fairly light			0
the first team were given both sunday and monday off after defeats by @entity38 and @entity22			0
a full staff meeting planned for thursday should allow for complaints to be aired publicly			0
@entity17 took the astonishing step of ending his six - year association with trusted aide @entity6 on tuesday after a complete breakdown in the pair ’s relationship			1
lots to think about : @entity4 lost their fourth @entity31 game on the spin at @entity22 on saturday @entity7 did not have a very distinguised playing career and his first coaching job came at @entity125 in 1998 , where he was football and community officer			1
he then moved to @entity129 ( where he joined up with @entity6 ) but his big break came when he became head of youth at @entity133 in 2006 under @entity17			2
he followed @entity17 to @entity92 , where he became football operations manager , and was part of the team that moved to @entity28 and then @entity4			1
@entity137 understands the move by @entity17 came after a heated exchange in the dressing room following saturday ’s defeat at @entity22			0
@entity17 ’s working relationship with @entity6 is said to have deteriorated so much that the pair have hardly spoken in recent weeks , causing disruption to @entity4 ’s preparation for games			1
many @entity4 fans have been vocal in their desire to see the manager gone too , with chants of ‘ we want @entity17 out ’ aired loudly during the loss at @entity50 on saturday			2
but the @entity93 ’s position is understood to be secure and he retains the backing of owner @entity154			0
however talks on a new three - year contract have been put on hold until the end of the season			0
his current deal expires at the end of next season			0
@entity17 and @entity6 first joined forces at @entity92 in 2008 , before leaving for @entity86 in 2009 and steering the @entity28 into the top flight			1
their success persuaded @entity4 owner @entity154 to appoint them after sacking @entity167 in 2012			2
walking into trrouble ? fans have turned on @entity17 , increasing the chances he could be leaving @entity4 have promoted former player and crowd favourite @entity171 , 55 , and goalkeeper @entity174 , 37 , to assist @entity17 while the club carry out their investigation			1
it is quite some turnaround for given , who has been left out of matchday squads and admitted in february that ‘ @entity4 want me out of the door			0
’ the @entity182 keeper has been taking his coaching badges and is respected by players			2
the club hope the change in key staff will raise morale and ensure a positive result from the important match against @entity191 at @entity71 on saturday			0
@entity17 said : ‘ i ’m delighted to have @entity171 and @entity174 to assist me in preparing the team for saturday ( against @entity191 ) , which is what the whole group is focused on			1
’ can we be of any assistance ? @entity171 ( left ) and @entity174 will help @entity17 the breakdown in relations between @entity17 and @entity6 has coincided with a dreadful run for the club that has seen them slip closer to the relegation zone			1
@entity4 have picked up just seven points from a possible 30 and are currently on a run of four defeats			0
@entity206 winner @entity171 said : ‘ the manager has asked me to step up to assist him at this time and i ’ll do my utmost for the club and the manager in helping prepare the team for saturday ’s game			2
’ given added : ‘ as players , it ’s important that each and every one of us take responsibility right now and i ’m delighted to play my part in helping the manager and the team go and try to win on saturday			2
