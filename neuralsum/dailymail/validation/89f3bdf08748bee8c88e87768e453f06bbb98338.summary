@entity7 was one of a number of pupils targeted by a paedophile teacher in the 1960s and 70s			1
she has waived her anonymity to tell of the impact the abuse had on her life and of her relief at seeing him jailed during her school days , @entity9 would catch @entity7 's eye during lessons , call her up to the front of the class and make her stand behind his desk while he sexually abused her			1
children were so afraid of the teacher , they would make themselves vomit by pouring washing up liquid down their throats to avoid his classes			2
@entity9 , now 73 , was finally reported over thirty years later in 2013 when ms @entity7 read about allegations of child abuse committed by @entity16 and rang police			1
her complaint was the first and started off a huge police investigation which led to 20 other victims coming forward			1
during his sentencing on november 5 last year , @entity53 heard that @entity9 was a bully who had an obsession with authority and abused children for his own sexual gratification			2
the court heard how @entity9 's offending extended to @entity65 lessons , where he would make children touch their toes so he could look at them , as well as wandering into their changing rooms during swimming lessons , in the hope of seeing them naked			2
@entity9 , who now uses a wheelchair , admitted 17 counts of indecent assault , three counts of indecency with a male and one of indecency with a child over a 12 - year period from the late 1960s and was jailed for five years			1
@entity9 's victim described him as an ' evil bully ' who wrecked the childhoods of his pupils @entity7 , of @entity87 , said : ' i was terrified of @entity9 , he was an evil bully and he ruined my childhood as well as many other people 's lives			1
' i came from a devout @entity95 family , my mother was a teacher and i was made to feel as though @entity96 was punishing me for something i had done wrong			2
' in year 5 , the year i went into @entity9 's class , it was common knowledge that something bad was going to happen to us and we were all afraid			2
' i could n't confide in any of my family and he was just getting away with abusing us - i feel completely let down by the school and my religion			0
ms @entity7 , pictured aged nine in 1973 , says the abuse she suffered at the hands of her teacher has impacted her whole life ' i feel as though he has made me the adult i am today , i 've found it hard to trust men and be the best mother i can be because of him			1
' as a child , ms @entity7 was shy and grew to hate school because of @entity9 's abuse			1
she would often feign illness and beg not to attend because she was scared of being abused by him again			0
she became depressed when she went to secondary school and hid the abuse for 40 years			2
she finally called the police to report him in july 2013			0
ms @entity7 , who is now training to become a chiropodist , said : ' i was sitting watching the news about @entity16 and @entity125 and i thought - i can not die with this sordid secret			1
' when i rang the police i felt as though a weight had been lifted from my shoulders			0
' i had carried guilt and shame around for years because i felt i was to blame			2
i lost my childhood and part of myself			0
it did a lot of damage			0
' it feels good to know that my actions have inspired others to come forward and report him as well			0
' i was prepared to stand up and look him in the eye to tell everyone what he did to me			0
he is an evil , disgusting human being			0
' five years is not long enough for the suffering he caused to hundreds of innocent children like me , but i am now glad he is in jail , paying for his crime and i can finally move on			0
' i only hope my story can persuade others to be brave and stand up to people like him so they can be brought to justice			0
' there is a lot of help available from @entity161 and @entity162			0
having a safe place to talk everything through really makes a big difference			0
' it is not an easy path but you come out of it feeling stronger			0
