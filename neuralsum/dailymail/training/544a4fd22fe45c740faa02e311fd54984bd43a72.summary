@entity0 has been accused of being an idealistic manager of @entity2			1
pressed on what it might take to keep @entity5 on a permanent basis , however , he became a hard - headed pragmatist			1
‘ money is always a key factor , ’ said the @entity8 bluntly			2
‘ we will see what happens , but everyone has to know we really want @entity5 to stay			1
i ’ve talked with him and he loves being here			2
he loves the club and we need to do everything we can now to make his move a permanent one			2
’ @entity18 striker @entity5 is on a season - loan at @entity2 from @entity21 champions @entity20 saying it is the easy part			1
putting together a deal which might make @entity5 commit himself to a @entity25 footballing landscape in financial decline is a trickier business			1
with eight goals in eight games - including wednesday night ’s hat - trick against @entity32 in the @entity33 - the striker has told anyone who will listen that he is honoured to be at @entity2 and enjoying his football for the first time since a successful loan year at @entity38			1
whether that translates to a permanent transfer is another story			2
@entity5 is believed to earn around £ 40,000 a week at @entity20 - significantly more than the highest - paid player at @entity2			1
there are parallels with the capture of @entity46 from @entity47			2
the 22 - year - old scored a hat - trick against @entity32 in the @entity33 , taking his tally to eight for the club like the @entity54 before him back in 2010 , the fact that @entity5 turns 23 this season means he could join @entity2 on a cross-border @entity55 when his @entity20 contract lapses next summer without the need for compensation			1
@entity61 clubs , in contrast , would be obliged to pay @entity20 a development fee for his services			1
the main question , then , revolves around wages			2
and @entity0 is hopeful that the sway of rebuilding an injury - plagued career with @entity2 can outweigh financial considerations when it comes time to reach a decision			1
asked what a player faced with a choice of £ 25,000 a week at @entity74 or £ 40,000 a week at a middling @entity21 club should do , the @entity8 was blunt			2
‘ the decision is very easy			2
you stay at @entity2 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s also important to know that @entity2 , if you take away the money , is still one of the biggest clubs in the world			1
‘ if you come here you have everything			2
you have stadium , supporters , fantastic pitches , good staff , history , and you have @entity91 football			2
@entity0 is confident @entity5 can be persuaded to stay at the club , even if they ca n't offer huge wages ‘ here you have what you need to get to your potential			1
’ during his time in charge at @entity99 in his native land , @entity0 signed players previously considered unobtainable by convincing them that a step backwards could bring two forward at a later date			1
he will try the same pitch with @entity5			1
money is important but that comes because of good performances , ’ said the @entity2 boss			1
‘ the best players always think : “ football , development , then the money comes as a consequence			0
” ‘ i ’ve seen it the other way around many times before			0
and it finishes very quick			0
‘ you can see the people that really want to learn and develop			0
you can see it in their attitude			0
those are the kind of players that we want at @entity2			1
they will get the money also			0
’ @entity0 has already spoken to @entity5 about the possibility to staying on			1
for his part , the player says he has no desire to lose his focus and form by thinking of the future too soon			0
@entity5 's @entity20 contract expires in the summer , so @entity2 could sign him on a @entity55 ‘ i want to give 100 per cent every game for @entity2 , ’ said the @entity18 after wednesday night ’s game			1
‘ when my agent comes to me and says : “ okay , @entity5 , this is what ’s going to happen , ” then i listen			1
’ agreeing with those sentiments , @entity0 said : ‘ he was happy			1
but it ’s important that he keeps focused on playing football			0
it ’s easy to lose focus and to think of other things			0
it had to happen with the agent and the club and we need to concentrate on performing every week			0
‘ we have good contact with them [ his agent ] as well			0
‘ he had been injured for a long time and there was a question mark over that			0
‘ but now things are going well and we hope we can keep him here			0
it is perfect for the club and the way we want to play			0
@entity0 said @entity2 is the perfect place for @entity5 to get his career back on track after a string of injuries ‘ @entity20 can not sell him to another club in january because we have him on loan for the season			1
so i do n’t think that is possible			0
we have a good relationship with @entity20 and we talk to them a lot			1
’ asked if @entity2 can afford @entity5 ’s wages , @entity0 conceded the need for goodwill and compromise if the player is to remain on the books at @entity74			1
‘ i think he has to go into our economy			0
i think that ’s possible			0
‘ it ’s important that he is performing well here and that he feels loved and wanted			0
to play at @entity2 when that happens , you ca n’t be in a better place			2
‘ i ’ve said to @entity5 that he needs stability to play			2
‘ he is a very good football player and he has started very well for us			0
he has a lot of potential and he still has a long way to go			0
‘ he is enjoying every minute here and he is wanted here			0
he is also loved here			0
it ’s also important that he is not just giving something to us , but we are giving something to him			0
‘ i think he sees that he is performing well now because the team are performing , too			0
those things are important when young players are picking the next stage of their career and the next club			0
