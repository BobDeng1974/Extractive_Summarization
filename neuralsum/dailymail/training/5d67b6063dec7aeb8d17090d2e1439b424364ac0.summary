despite its name , the @entity7 , @entity6 may be leaving some public school children wanting for more as choose to starve rather than eat the vegetables and ‘ brown wheat ’ required by the law			1
‘ they say it tastes like vomit , ’ @entity14 , @entity2 school board member @entity13			1
at least someone 's happy : the @entity19 has long pushed for healthier school lunches but some @entity2 school children and their parents are pushing back @entity23 was among a chorus of angry voices at a recent @entity27 board meeting , where many parents said their kids are coming home hungry , reports the @entity30			1
‘ it ’s strange and different for them , so they do n’t like it , ’ said @entity31 , director of school and community nutrition , who was on hand to explain that the new lunches were required by law			0
but @entity41 held her ground and repeated that the milk ‘ tastes like vomit			0
’ the new regulations have a calorie cap and require that school meals include only one portion of meat or protein			0
they also stipulate that milk be either skim or one percent fat and that bread be ‘ brown wheat			0
’ in an effort to curb obesity , carbohydrates like @entity59 fries may only be served in three - fourths of a cup portions and kids in elementary school — where the complaints mostly seem to originate — may only be served a total of 650 calories per meal			0
forcing a smile ? a @entity14 school student poses with his lunch			1
many parents in the @entity74 say their children wont ' eat skim milk and wheat bread -- food items they 're not accustomed to fair ? the @entity7 established new standards for all foods sold in schools with an emphasis on more veggies and fewer calories			1
students with extra money may buy extra lunches , however the restrictions and lack of enthusiasm over unlimited fruits and vegetables have some parents concerned their children wo n’t get enough to eat			1
‘ kids ca n’t learn when they ’re hungry , ’ many parents moaned			2
the @entity7 , @entity6 only applies to the lunch - per - day provided by the school			2
an additional lunch may be purchased by students who have the cash			0
which leaves students in @entity2 , a state among the nation ’s fattest and poorest , in a pickle			2
backed into a legal corner by the @entity19 ’s law and students and parents more accustomed to calorie dense meals from a box than they are to unlimited fruit , @entity31 could only play the role of soothsayer			0
he assured @entity41 and the other parents that a taste test of the milk would be conducted			0
angry : in @entity2 , one of @entity120 's fattest and poorest states , a law that allows only those with extra cash to eat more than 650 calories per meal has come with predictable outrage			2
