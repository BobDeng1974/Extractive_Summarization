a tiny spider that builds much bigger elaborate decoy spiders and hangs them in its web to fool predators has been discovered in the @entity4			1
the artful arthropod crafts its decoys from dead insects , debris and leaves in what scientists suspect is a defence mechanism to avoid being eaten			0
it is believed to be a new species of @entity14 , a genus which includes other sculpting arachnids but none of which of which have been observed to build replicas with multiple , spidery legs			1
@entity22 : the spider sits above its decoy in a flood plain surrounding @entity27 's @entity26 biologist and science teacher @entity29 discovered the apparently novel spider in september as he led tourists in a floodplain surrounding @entity27 's @entity26			1
' from afar , it appears to be a medium sized spider about an inch across , possibly dead and dried out , hanging in the center of a spider web along the side of the trail , ' he wrote in a blog post for eco-tourism firm @entity41			0
such sights are not out of the ordinary for the @entity45 , he writes , but as he approached the apparently decomposing arthropod it began to wobble back and forth as it it was alive			0
' step in even closer and things start to get weird - that spider form you were looking at is actually made up of tiny bits of leaf , debris , and dead insects , ' ' the confusion sets in			0
how can something be constructed to look like a spider , how is it moving , and what kind of creature made this ! ? ' it turns out the master designer behind this somewhat creepy form is in fact a tiny spider ' never seen before : the spider ( pictured left in close up ) is believed to be a new species in the genus @entity73 , which includes other sculpting arachnids , but none of which have been observed to build such life - like replicas mr @entity29 , who divides his time between @entity27 and @entity80 , told @entity81 the discovery was unlike anything he had ever seen before			1
' it blew my mind , ' he said			0
mr @entity29 contacted @entity87 , an arachnologist at @entity88 , who agreed it was an unusual find			0
she told @entity81 it was likely to be an unidentified species			2
even among the decoy - building species of @entity73 , she said , decoys with legs and the web - shaking behaviour have not been observed before			2
after speaking with experts , mr @entity29 returned to the trails around @entity97 and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the same floodplain			1
searches in other areas nearby did not find any of the spiders , he added , suggesting they have a restricted range			0
new to science : biologist and science teacher @entity29 discovered the spider in september as he led tourists in a floodplain around @entity97 in the @entity4 limited range : after speaking with experts , mr @entity29 returned to the trails around @entity97 and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the same floodplain , but none further afield @entity117 , an entomologist at the @entity118 who studies web - building , said he had never before seen a structure like the ones found in the @entity45			1
@entity73 are known for decoy building , but most of their constructions are clumpy rather than something which resembles and actual spider			0
' @entity73 do n’t have that spider - with - leg looking thing , which is why we think it ’s a new species , ' mr @entity29 said			2
he hopes to return to the area in january with a permit to collect samples , in preparation for submitting a study and getting the new species officially recognised .			1

apparent new species found in a floodplain in the @entity4
entomologists say they have seen nothing like it before
finder now plans to return and collect samples specimens for proper study
