in the latest of our regular series on the travel tales of the rich and famous , forever - young model @entity3 tells us about suncream disasters , rain in @entity6 and the timeless joys of @entity8			1
do you like cruising holidays ? i have only been on two cruises and enjoyed both			1
my first was in 2012 , when i was invited by @entity13 to be godmother to one of their new ships			1
what i like about cruising is that you get to visit lots of different countries but only have to unpack once			2
@entity3 : wo n't make the sun - cream mistake twice favourite places in the @entity23 ? @entity24 in @entity8			1
it was designed in the style of an @entity28 village and feels like entering another world			1
it 's so colourful , with rhododendron , azalea and camellia bushes			2
favourite hotel in the world ? @entity36 in @entity37			1
it was my daughter @entity39 's 15th birthday when we went , and we treated her to lunch on the hotel 's private island			2
we also tried paragliding , and although i was screaming all the way , the views of the clear turquoise sea and surrounding landscape were well worth it			2
what 's the strangest meal you 've eaten ? @entity54 was playing @entity55 in a royal shakespeare production of a @entity57 in @entity58 , and we went to a restaurant for soup which had real gold leaf floating on top			2
it did n't actually taste of anything , though			0
worst holiday disaster ? a friend once lent us her villa near @entity68			0
before we arrived , the sun had been shining continuously for three months			0
but when we got there , it started raining and did n't stop for the next eight days			0
we became good at jigsaws , though			0
any packing tips ? roll up your clothes in your suitcase rather than laying them flat			0
apart from not creasing as much , you can pack more in			0
also , never pack any liquids - a bottle of suntan oil once came open in my suitcase and ruined my favourite clothes , which i was really upset about			0
where are you off to next ? @entity85			1
besides @entity87 , it 's my favourite city in the world			0
in the early @entity89 , i was in a @entity91 musical called @entity92 , which ran for a couple of years			1
i made lots of friends , so @entity85 is now like a second home to me			1
@entity3 for @entity97 is available online at @entity98 .			0
