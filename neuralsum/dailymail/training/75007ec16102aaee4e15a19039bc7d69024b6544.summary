ever wanted to own a transformer ? thanks to a @entity4 company , that dream is not far away			0
called ' j - deite quarter ' , a project to create a working quarter - scale machine that can change from a car into a robot has been completed			1
now the team have released images and video of the transformation process in full flow - with even larger versions set to follow in future			0
scheduled to be completed by 2020 , the current robot is 4.3ft ( 1.3 metres ) tall - but it will eventually be 16.4ft ( five metres ) high			1
back in august a real - life @entity0 was created by scientists at the @entity37 's @entity36 , inspired by the @entity4 paper - folding art of origami			1
in tests , the small shape - changing robot ( pictured ) folded itself into a functional machine that could walk and turn without human help			0
but unlike the popular @entity0 toys - robots that disguise themselves as cars and trucks - the device is not aimed at children but rather for other applications like search and rescue operations			0
their next goal will be to create a half - scale model , 8.2ft ( 2.5 metres ) tall , due by 2016			2
the robot , which weighs 77lbs ( 35kg ) , was unveiled at the annual @entity28 in @entity29 on 23 october 2014			0
it can walk on two legs at a speed of 0.62mph ( 1km/h ) , but when it changes to ‘ car mode ’ however , it can reach speeds of 6.2mph ( 10 km / h )			1
in the video it is seen moving its head , lifting its arms and of course changing into car mode - all in a matter of seconds			1
however , when in robot mode it seems to prefer an awkward waddle , rather than walking in full stride like a real transformer			0
it is powered by something called ‘ @entity72 ’ , software designed by creator @entity19 to allow anyone to control humanoid robots			0
the team does n’t have plans to release the robot to the public , instead only building it as a prototype			2
but fans of @entity0 will surely be looking forward to the finished model			0
the transformer is seen moving its head , lifting its arms and changing into car mode - all in a matter of seconds			2
however , when in robot mode it seems to prefer an awkward waddle , rather than walking in full stride like a real @entity0 the prototype robot was created by a collaboration involving @entity22 , @entity20 and @entity32			1
scheduled to be completed by 2020 , the current robot is 4.3ft ( 1.3 metres ) tall - but it will eventually be 16.4ft ( five metres )			1
it operates in both car mode ( left ) and robot mode ( right )			2

@entity4 inventors have unveiled their humanoid @entity0 robot
called ' j - deite quarter ' it can change from a robot into a car
the current model is 4.3ft ( 1.3 metres ) tall
but the eventual plan is to build one 16.4ft ( five metres ) tall by 2020
when walking it moves at 0.62mph ( 1km/h )
in ' car mode ' though it can reach speeds of @entity114 ( *10km/h* )
the robot is only a prototype and will not be available for public release
