by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 03:46 est , 19 july 2012 @entity1 was accused of hypocrisy yesterday after it emerged that his team of political advisers has ballooned from three to 14 at a cost to the taxpayer of £ 900,000 a year			1
the figure represents the lion ’s share of the £ 1.3million annual bill for the 21 @entity12 special advisers			2
details of the increase , which is another breach of a manifesto promise , were slipped out in a @entity17 statement as mps broke up for their 47 - day summer recess			1
unpopular : @entity1 's approval rating has reached a new low of minus 59 , down from a heady plus 53 in the halcyon days of may 2010 when the @entity22 was formed in @entity23 mr @entity1 pledged that a @entity12 government would never burden the taxpayer with the bill for special advisers , nicknamed spads			1
in september 2009 , in a policy document a @entity30 , he pledged : ‘ the [ @entity32 ] government employs 74 special advisers , an increase of 90 per cent since 1995 , at a cost to the taxpayer of £ 5.9million each year			1
‘ these are political jobs and therefore should be funded by political parties			1
special advisers will not be paid for by the taxpayer			1
’ but now he is in government , the deputy prime minister has abandoned the commitment to slashing @entity44 ’s ‘ @entity43 ’			2
he had three political advisers when the @entity22 began , now there are 14			1
the cost of his private office has soared by 200 per cent in a year at a time when he is demanding deep cuts in public spending			2
the highest paid adviser is @entity54 , mr @entity1 ’s chief of staff , whose £ 98,000 salary comfortably tops the £ 89,000 paid to junior ministers			1
three other advisers are paid £ 80,000 a year , including @entity58 , a millionaire accountant who has donated £ 88,000 to @entity12 funds			2
he is the @entity12 ’ first director of government relations			0
his former employer , @entity64 giant @entity63 , already earns vast sums from @entity67 accounting contracts			0
@entity68 , special adviser to chief secretary to the treasury @entity69 , is paid £ 74,000			2
until her defeat at the last election she was @entity68 mp for @entity73 and @entity74 , with a salary of £ 65,738 – so she has received an £ 8,000 pay rise from public funds since losing her seat			0
the rest are paid an average of £ 64,500 – only slightly less than the £ 65,750 paid to mps			2
@entity32 accused mr @entity1 of double standards			1
@entity83 , shadow minister for the @entity84 , said : ‘ even from a man who is used to breaking promises , this is total hypocrisy from @entity1 and the @entity12			1
‘ his party used to say special advisers should n’t be funded by the taxpayer but now , as this shambolic government lurches from crisis to crisis he ’s attempting to shore himself up with a raft of new political appointees paid for by the public			1
you ca n’t believe a word he says			0
prime minister @entity99 and deputy prime minister @entity1 give a speech at the @entity101 in @entity102 announcing a 9.4 billion package of rail projects earlier this week ‘ @entity58 should not be rewarded for his donations to the @entity12 with a publicly funded job			1
’ some of the @entity12 advisers are monitoring the @entity108 , the @entity109 , the @entity110 , and the education and health departments , which are all run by @entity114 cabinet ministers			0
yet the spending spree , which is designed to burnish the @entity12 ’ battered image , has done nothing to halt the slide in mr @entity1 ’s approval ratings			1
the most recent @entity121 poll found that mr @entity1 ’s approval rating had reached a new low of minus 59 , down from a heady plus 53 in the halcyon days of may 2010 when the @entity22 was formed			1
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ they do not work directly for the party , they work for @entity12 ministers in the government			0
’ @entity99 is also under fire from his own mps for reneging on his pledge to cut the number of staff on the @entity17 payroll			0
in a speech in september 2009 , he said : ‘ if we are going to take our country through these difficult times those who lead must lead by powerful example			2
that means getting our own house in order and cutting the cost of politics			0
’ the @entity22 agreement , published in may 2010 , promised to introduce a limit on the number of special advisers			0
the number has now reached 81 – one more than under @entity151			0
the total salary bill is £ 6.2million , up 30 per cent on the £ 4.8million in the first year of government			0
the bulk of the rise is accounted for by the increase in @entity12 advisers			0
mr @entity99 has 19 special advisers including @entity159 , his personal pollster , and @entity161 , the director of communications , who are both paid £ 140,000			2
@entity164 , @entity114 mp for @entity165 , said : ‘ the more advisers this government recruits the bigger the mess it seems to make of things			0
‘ what is the point of them ? if they were experts in policy the cost might just be acceptable			0
‘ most of them look no more than 15 years old and seem more suited to making the tea than advising senior cabinet ministers			0

' these are political jobs and should be funded by political parties . they will not be paid for by the taxpayer ' - @entity1 's words in *opposition* in 2009
