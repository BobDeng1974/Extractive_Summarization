by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 14:35 est , 22 march 2013 following a new report that 29per cent of @entity4 are trying to cut back on gluten , a woman with celiac disease has launched a plea for people to stop giving it up without a viable medical reason			1
@entity10 , who was diagnosed with the immune disease 14 years ago , explains that a gluten - free diet is not as healthy - or slimming - as it is hyped up to be			1
' i have met many a celiac over the years , ' the blogger wrote on @entity16			0
' and i promise we would n't all pass your supermarket tabloids " bikini body " test			0
' just a fad ? as 29per cent of @entity4 cut back on gluten , @entity10 - who was diagnosed with celiac disease 14 years ago - explains that the trendy diet is not worthy of all the hype in fact , the @entity28 graduate says that a gluten - free diet can actually lead to weight gain , since a lot of gluten - free foods are higher in fat to substitute the missing gluten			1
but it has its staunch advocates , including high - profile stars such as @entity39 and @entity40 , who openly discuss the benefits of cutting out grains such as wheat , barley and rye			0
fashion writer @entity46 , who has been gluten - free for over a year now , is a huge fan of her new lifestyle			1
she told @entity49 that she first began avoiding gluten following a doctor 's recommendation			0
and now , ' i might not be a size four , but my life has improved tremendously , ' she said of the diet			0
the writer , who noticed she was having stomach issues when she ate wheat , says these days she just sticks to carbohydrates like quinoa and brown rice			0
even though ms @entity46 does not suffer from celiac disease , she says eating wheat does make her feel ' pretty crappy '			2
still , @entity10 insists that going gluten - free ' is not an almond flour paved path to the @entity68 holy trifecta of increased energy , a dewy complexion and perfectly fitting skinny jeans			1
' '' going gluten - free is not an almond flour - paved path to increased energy , a dewy complexion and perfectly fitting skinny jeans ' instead , using the diet as an excuse to lose weight only has a damaging effect on people who actually suffer from the disease			1
she explains that ever since gluten - free dieting has become trendy , ' waiters , thinking i am just another ankle - boot wearing @entity84 wannabe , no longer take me seriously			1
' what 's more , people who give up gluten when they do n't need to could be cutting out healthy foods from their diet			2
' fiber is one of the most important things you can eat for health 's sake , ' she says , adding that a slice of whole wheat bread is ' by no means worse for you than a slice of teff , garbanzo bean and brown rice fiber bread			0
' and while celebrities can afford to stock up on expense gluten - free goods , for others it is not so easy			1
negative effect : the author ( pictured ) explains that ever since gluten - free dieting has become trendy , ' @entity82 , thinking i am just another ankle - boot wearing @entity84 wannabe , no longer take me seriously ' according to the @entity116 in @entity117 , gluten - free foods cost on average 242per cent more than the gluten - containing versions , indeed , ms @entity10 notes that it is normal for her to shell out $ 12 for one whole - grain gluten - free loaf of bread			1
but there is also a growing concern that people are using a gluten allergy to mask their real eating disorders			0
while a recent study by the @entity129 shows that 29 % of @entity4 are trying to cut back on gluten , under one per cent of the population actually suffers from celiac disease			1
' i might not be a size four , but my life has improved tremendously since going gluten - free ' since the diet has recently been touted a way to lose weight , it would appear many are trying it out solely for this reason			2
in any case , there is no doubt that avoiding certain food ingredients goes in cycles , and gluten seems to be the trend of today			0
in fact , the gluten - free movement is number two on @entity155 's top ten food trends for 2012			2
' @entity156 is the pariah ingredient du jour , ' says an article in the magazine			0
' and there are a lot of healthy people shelling out big bucks for gluten - free food they probably do nâ€™t need			2
' but for real sufferers of celiac disease , the diet is a serious lifetime commitment , not just a temporary fad			2
' a little dusting of flour on a piece of flounder equals a few days in bed for me , ' says ms @entity10 .			0

according to a study by the @entity129 , 29per cent of @entity4 are now trying to cut back on gluten
@entity180 , who suffers from celiac disease , says that gluten - free foods are not only 242per cent more expensive than their gluten - containing *varieties* , but they also often have a higher fat content
