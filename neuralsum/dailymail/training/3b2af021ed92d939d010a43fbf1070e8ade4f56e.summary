by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 26 september 2013 the eurasian beaver , @entity4 bison and white - tailed eagle are among the animals that have made a remarkable comeback in @entity8 over the past 50 years , zoologists said			1
a total of 27 mammal and bird species recovered over the past 50 years thanks to legislative measures and conservation efforts , according to the first ever report of its kind			1
scientists from the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , @entity20 and the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) worked with experts from across @entity8 to gather relevant data about the distribution and abundance of selected species			1
the @entity4 bison ( pictured ) became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss			0
but a large - scale breeding and reintroduction programme has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern @entity8 the report , ‘ @entity33 in @entity8 ’ , investigates how and why the doomed species bounced back and provides important lessons for the conservation of these and other species			1
of the 18 mammals surveyed , all of them are making a comeback apart from the @entity42 , whose population has declined by 84 per cent since 1965			1
now there are just 279 living in the wild			0
a total of 19 birds were surveyed , with the biggest increase in population belonging to the barnacle goose			2
numbers of the bird have risen 7,650 per cent since 1947 thanks to a decline in hunting and increased protection of the birds ' nesting sites			0
of the 18 mammals surveyed for the report , all of them are making a comeback apart from the @entity42 ( pictured ) , whose population has declined by 84 per cent since 1965 professor @entity65 , @entity19 ’s director of conservation said : ' it is essential that we both celebrate and learn from major successes in conservation			1
' this study helps us understand the interventions and conditions necessary for a broad range of species to experience similar recoveries			1
' among the species to reverse their fortunes , is the @entity80 , which is one of the world 's largest birds of prey			0
populations of large carnivores declined as farmers sought to protect their livestock from attack			0
a eurasian brown bear found in @entity90 is pictured left , as well as a wild boar , right following a dramatic decline in its numbers and extinction in some countries between 1800 and 1970 , the bird has made an impressive recovery			0
thanks to legal protection , the @entity4 population grew from fewer than 2,500 pairs in 1970 to 9,600 pairs in 2010 and the species has recently recolonised parts of its former range in northern and central @entity8			1
populations of the @entity108 imperial eagle rose by 734 per cent			0
the @entity110 lynx ( pictured ) was limited to the southwestern part of the @entity110 peninsula by the mid- 1960s			0
there are fewer than 200 animals in the wild			0
they have suffered due to hunting , habitat loss and road accidents , but the most critical threat today is the reduced numbers of wild rabbits within the lynx 's range the @entity4 bison , which is the largest herbivore in @entity8 , became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss			2
however , a large - scale breeding and reintroduction programme based on individuals remaining in captivity has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern @entity8			2
@entity133 and @entity134 are the stronghold for the rekindled species , which now has a population of almost 3,000 individuals			0
the @entity138 ( pictured ) declined dramatically after the 19th century as a result of habitat loss , caused mainly by drainage of wetlands			0
with the establishment of international treaties and conventions , the majority of breeding sites are now protected across its range in @entity8 numbers of @entity150 have risen by 855 per cent since 1960 , while populations of grey wolves are up 303 per cent since 1970			2
@entity153 , managing director of @entity8 , said : ' wildlife will bounce back if we allow it to – this report shows that			1
' with continued and strong legal protection , active boosting of existing wildlife populations and reintroductions to bring back lost species , combined with an increasing tolerance towards wildlife , more species will surely follow			0
' following a dramatic decline in its numbers and extinction in some countries between 1800 and 1970 , the white - tailed eagle has made an impressive recovery thanks to legal protection while the study focuses on 27 species of mammals and birds , @entity19 said the comeback is not limited to these animals as there are many more that are showing similar patterns of recovery			1
however , they warn that despite a fightback from certain @entity4 species , biodiversity is still being lost and the findings of the report must be viewed in the context of large historical declines			2
for carnivores like the @entity189 lynx and grey wolf and many bird species including the red kite , distributions and numbers had already declined dramatically from their historical levels by the mid- 20th century			1
at 16 kilos and with a 3 metre wing span , the dalmatian pelican is one of the world 's heaviest flying birds			0
it has made a very successful comeback in the last 30 years , thanks mainly to nature protection measures			1
@entity206 is one of the most productive fish waters in @entity8 , and supports thousands of the birds the scientists said wildlife resurgence should be assessed cautiously , as many species have not yet reached the level necessary to secure sustainable populations			1
@entity215 , @entity216 , said : ' this report shows first of all the amazing resilience of nature			0
' the rewilding of @entity8 exceeds nature protection , because these iconic species create unique opportunities for rural development			2
