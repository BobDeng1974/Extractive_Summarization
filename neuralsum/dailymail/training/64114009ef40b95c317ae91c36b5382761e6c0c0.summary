by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 07:35 est , 6 april 2012 a ban on hosepipes for 20 million people - the strictest ever imposed - is now in force across most of the south and east of the country			2
it follows two consecutive dry winters and water firms say the ban is likely to last until the autumn if not into next year , even if there is normal rainfall during the summer			1
but the @entity14 have warned the hosepipe ban is just the first step to help conserve water supplies , in the worst drought since 1976			1
dry as a bone : five - year - old @entity21 paddling in @entity22 near @entity23 , @entity24 , which is currently standing at 49 per cent of its capacity last resort : a return to standpipes in the street , used in the drought of 1976 is the final option if water levels continue to drop the @entity14 have warned the hosepipe ban is the first step to help conserve water supplies , in the worst drought since 1976			1
after the hosepipe ban there are in effect , three water - saving stages : 1			1
if water levels continue to drop then the second stage is caps on non-essential business use such as watering golf courses , cleaning pavements and car washes could follow.2			1
next public and commercial swimming pools will be instructed to shut down as well as industries which rely on mains supplies such as food processors			0
finally there could be a time table imposed when people are told to only use water at set times			2
another measure could be asking certain areas to share standpipes in the street , similar to what residents in 1976 experienced when there was a severe drought if water levels continue to drop then the second stage is caps on non-essential business use such as watering golf courses , cleaning pavements and car washes			1
next public and commercial swimming pools will be instructed to shut down as well as industries which rely on mains supplies such as food processors			0
finally there could be a timetable imposed when people are told to only use water at set times			2
another measure could be asking certain areas to share standpipes in the street , similar to what residents in 1976 experienced when there was a severe drought			1
seven water companies @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity83 and @entity85 and @entity86 have all imposed bans			2
a list of eleven activities banned in the @entity90 includes using hosepipes to wash the car , water plants and clean windows ; fill fountains , ponds and paddling pools and even hose down children on a hot day			1
and that 's where it gets confusing			0
water companies are allowed to interpret the rules however they wish , meaning some activities are banned by one water company and allowed by another			0
@entity82 customers will be able to wash their cars with a hosepipe , but neighbours supplied by @entity112 will not			0
those who flout the ban could be forced to pay a £ 1,000 fine , after being sent a single ' yellow card ' warning in the post			0
even spraying your children to keep them cool in the sunshine will be outlawed , and those caught breaking the rules face a £ 1,000 fine			0
the strict rules are an attempt to close any loopholes after the last hosepipe ban in 2006 led to widespread accusations of cheating , with thousands reported to water companies by their neighbours or served with ' yellow card ' letters warning them to obey the law			2
commenting on the likelihood of returning to standpipes , @entity135 , which represents major @entity137 water suppliers said ' we think it 's very unlikely - we would look at it as a last resort			2
' second stage : if water levels continue to drop then the next stage after the current hosepipe ban is asking non-essential users such as golf courses and car washes to stop using water closed down : if water levels do not improve then then the next stage is public and commercial swimming pools have to close and water intensive industries like food processors that use mains supplies @entity155 said ' the environmental drought is a very serious situation , but at this stage standpipes are a very distant prospect which we are not even contemplating at this stage			1
' we are confident that our customers recognise the severity of the situation and will do what they can to help save water across our region			0
' @entity168 , chief executive of @entity81 said : ' groundwater levels in the aquifers , which we rely on for both borehole and river supplies , are well below where we would normally expect them to be			0
in some cases they are at their lowest levels ever recorded at this time of year			0
' we know these restrictions will be unpopular , but they will save a lot of water			0
a garden sprinkler uses as much water in an hour as a family of four uses in a day , and when water is in short supply , the needs of families must come first			0
feeling the pinch : many businesses are already feeling effects of the hosepipe ban : garden centres face singificant losses as people will not be buying plants if they can not water them still waters : the famous fountains in @entity198 have been turned off as part of a hosepipe ban imposed across @entity201 as a result of low rainfall this winter running dry : tourists may not be able to cool off this summer in @entity206 's @entity198 fountains after the water supply was turned off under the hosepipe ban the hosepipe ban is already causing problems for business - for example garden centres are facing significant losses as people will not be purchasing plants if they can not water them			1
earlier this week @entity81 ordered the water supply to @entity215 's fountains be cut as part of a blanket restriction , which includes ornamental fountains , designed to conserve drought - hit reservoirs			1
the @entity220 said the current water stocks feeding the fountains will run out at the weekend			2
negotiations are underway to see if a compromise can be found in time for the arrival of millions of tourists to @entity198 during the @entity227 and jubilee summer			1
water companies said that without persistent above - average rainfall for several weeks , the unpopular measures could last until the end of the summer in the 14 counties which are already officially in drought			1
otherwise they face ' severe drought ' by the summer , the @entity14 warned yesterday , which could result in extending restrictions to businesses			2
hosepipe bans may also be enforced in @entity242 and @entity243 which are at ' high risk ' of drought conditions this summer , the agency 's @entity239 report said			1
dry : the @entity247 in the village of @entity249 , near @entity250 , is just one of many waterways with record low levels as @entity254 faces a strict hosepipe ban to combat the drought its chairman @entity257 urged businesses to cut down on use , as electricity companies which use water for cooling and water - intensive industries such as concrete manufacturing could be affected			1
the @entity267 's long - range forecast , which is given to @entity268 and businesses , revealed that the chances of heavy rain are as low as 10 per cent between march and may , compared with a long - term average of 20 per cent			0
the average person uses 150 litres of water a day			0
water company infrastructure across @entity254 and @entity276 leaked 3.4billion litres a day in 2010/11 – a third of the @entity137 's usage – according to the regulator @entity279			0
drought conditions are already affecting fruit and cereal crops , as well as destroying wildlife habitats and causing fish to die in low rivers			1
@entity286 of the @entity287 said that if consumers do not start curbing their water use at home , the economy will be affected			0
' if water levels in drought - stricken areas do n't improve , hosepipe bans could be just the beginning and industry will start to be affected , ' he said			1
this is one of the largest hosepipe bans ever implemented			0
the last in the @entity83 was in 2006 affecting 12million people , and 7million in the @entity300 were hit in 2010 .			0

hose pipe ban was introduced this week after two dry winters in a row
second stage if water levels continue to drop is instructing non-essential users such as car washes golf courses to stop using water
@entity313 rolled in the dry summer of 1976 are the final resort if drought continues
drought conditions are already affecting fruit and cereal crops , as well as destroying wildlife habitats and causing fish to die in low rivers
