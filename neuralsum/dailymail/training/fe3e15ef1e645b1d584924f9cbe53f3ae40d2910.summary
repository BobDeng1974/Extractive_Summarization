for @entity4 star @entity3 , standing on stage at the famed @entity1 on @entity2 was a momentous occasion			1
indeed , for the entire group , it was a dream come true as they debuted their new show a musical affair last week			0
what was once a ‘ popera ’ act created by @entity13 - which as bandmate @entity14 admits no - one believed would last longer than two years - had now reached this pinnacle , spanning 10 years and selling more than 26 million albums worldwide			2
but for @entity18 - born @entity3 especially , the work has been grueling as he has strives to juggle @entity4 and his growing family – jetting home to see his wife and three young children between shows around the globe			1
happy family : @entity4 star @entity3 and his wife @entity26 have three children - and are now discussing a fourth - as they juggle his hectic touring schedule @entity2 - bound : @entity4 , from left , @entity29 , @entity3 , @entity30 and @entity14 , leave the @entity32 studios in @entity33 in april			1
they launched @entity35 on @entity2 last week @entity36 : @entity4 warble some of the musical greats during their show at the @entity1 on opening night on @entity2 last wednesday and for the first time , @entity3 , 40 , reveals just why it ’s so important to him to make sure he spends as much time as possible with his beloved wife @entity26 , and their five - year - old twins @entity45 and @entity46 and two - year - old son @entity44			1
when he was just six , the dashing @entity50 ’s father @entity49 left him and his mother @entity51 , then only 24			0
and in an exclusive interview today , @entity3 tells @entity58 : ‘ i had a difficult childhood , i did n’t have very present parents because they separated early and my mum had to keep everything together and manage a child and work			1
‘ she was young and she was not very much around , she did the best she could with what she had			0
but i had to manage myself from an early age , i did n’t have a lot of support , so that ’s why i ’m really present with my children			0
’ once revealing he lived with his mother in a ‘ tiny room on top of an apartment block , with an outside toilet and only a sink to wash in ’ , @entity3 went on to become a pop star in @entity18 at 21 after telling how the piano became his ‘ therapist ’			1
daddy : @entity3 says @entity13 , who created @entity4 , will be a good father to his baby son , adding : ' i think that people you do n't expect to be changing nappies suddenly change ' and he is quick to add : ‘ i ’m very close to my mum now … i do n’t see my father - i made a choice , but i feel like i ’m good , i ’m lucky			1
’ after meeting his wife @entity26 in her native @entity87 where she worked as a publicist for @entity89 , the couple wed in august 2008			1
however , @entity26 suffered not just one but two difficult pregnancies , battling a host of health problems			1
the first culminated in their twins being born three months prematurely by emergency caesarean as @entity26 developed the condition pre-eclampsia , with dangerously high blood pressure – prompting @entity3 to pull out of an @entity4 tour of @entity100 as he says : ‘ there was no question , it was not easy to understand for the group , but my family will always come first			1
i could not perform , i had to be by her side			0
’ for weeks it was not known whether the tiny babies would survive			0
and during her second labour , with their son @entity44 , now two , @entity26 came close to death herself after suffering placental abruption			2
as @entity3 told the @entity114 in 2011 : ‘ it ’s been very difficult but it pulled us closer together			1
we have risked death to be parents			0
’ @entity26 has spoken out about her pregnancy battles and @entity3 says : ‘ i ’m pleased that she spoke about it , pre-eclampsia is the number one death in pregnancy			1
‘ it ’s such a difficult thing and not enough is known			2
the reality is that we have some friends who ’ve gone in and in 10 minutes had a nice delivery , but we had none of that , what we experienced means everything is more precious			0
‘ it was definitely risky for @entity26 and the kids , it was really tough			2
’ clearly proud of his family , @entity3 delights in recounting their recent visits to the zoos and museums around @entity141 after @entity26 and the children – whom he says are already musical much to his chagrin , sighing : ‘ i do n’t want them to do what @entity76 does , i want to keep them at home ! ’ miracles : the twins that @entity3 and his wife @entity26 thought they may lose when they were born three months prematurely			1
@entity45 and @entity46 are now five and thriving devoted : @entity3 , pictured in @entity36 last week , says he is even more appreciative of his young family after suffering a difficult childhood he adds : ‘ @entity26 was here with the kids for the last two weeks and it was utterly madness , we have five - year - old twins and a two - year - old like a rugby player , he ’s like his granddad who ’s 6ft 5 , so it was challenging			1
’ but , he reveals that during the visit : ‘ we talked about having a fourth one when we settle , probably in @entity165 , next year			0
‘ we would like to have another one … i ’m an only child and i dreamed of having a big family			0
the problem is finding the right balance between family and work			0
‘ @entity26 was in the entertainment industry , she understands the downside of having a husband who comes home and sleeps , but somehow it just works , we manage to find a balance and it seems to be working for now			2
’ ' we talked about having a fourth child when we settle , probably in @entity165 , next year			0
i ’m an only child and i dreamed of having a big family ... the problem is finding the right balance between family and work ' as for mr @entity13 , who created @entity4 after having the idea of forming a modern day three tenors , @entity3 laughs when asked about the music millionaire ’s impending fatherhood			1
@entity13 ’s baby boy with girlfriend @entity189 is due in february and @entity3 says : ‘ everyone wonders what @entity13 will be like as a father , but i think he ’ll be good			2
‘ i think people that you do n’t expect to be changing nappies suddenly change			0
when you become a dad you change , that ’s the way it is , you have this little life relying on you , good and bad			0
‘ i ’m very hands on with my kids			0
i would be a manny ! i would be happy to be at home with my kids , but i can see how challenging it is			0
’ and indeed , his fellow bandmate , @entity14 says he and his wife , stunning opera singer @entity207 – who recently played tragic @entity208 in the @entity210 ’s production – have decided that ‘ right now is n’t the time ’ for them to become parents			2
singing sensations : @entity4 tenor @entity14 and his wife @entity215 at the opening night of @entity217 in september , in which @entity207 had the starring role tragic : @entity14 's wife @entity215 played tragic playmate @entity208 in the @entity210 's production in september married to @entity207 since 2009 , @entity14 , 40 , tells @entity58 : ‘ we talk about it a lot , we look at @entity223 – but the children would have to be travelling or they would have to be raised by a nanny and that ’s not something either of us want			1
we ’re both very emotional people and very attached to the people in our lives			0
‘ it would n’t be fair , one of our careers would have to give			0
’ along with their fellow bandmates , @entity236 baritone @entity29 , @entity237 tenor @entity30 , @entity3 and @entity14 will now tour @entity238 and @entity239 with a @entity35 following their six - night run on @entity2			1
this will be followed by a worldwide tour from next september			0
@entity3 says : ‘ the show ’s going great , it ’s wonderful to be in one place and it ’s very refreshing to sing a new repertoire rather than having to sing @entity247 for the 30,000th time ! the songs are beautiful			2
’ tour : @entity4 will now take a musical affair around @entity238 and @entity239 , it was revealed today talent : @entity4 join @entity255 , who stars in a @entity35 , at the @entity257 finale at @entity36 's @entity258 in september with @entity14 being the last member to be signed to @entity4 in december 2003 following a worldwide two - year search , @entity3 admits : ‘ it ’s a miracle in terms of what happened for the four of us			1
‘ we do n’t seem to be a band that seems to rest ! in terms of recording , @entity13 is able to trust us , we ’re really independent and we ’re grown up – and he ’s going to have a lot to deal with ! ’ @entity14 adds : ‘ @entity4 has had a much longer life than any of us thought it would – it ’s gone on about eight years longer than anyone – the group , @entity13 , our management – thought it would			2
no - one could have predicted our global success			0
