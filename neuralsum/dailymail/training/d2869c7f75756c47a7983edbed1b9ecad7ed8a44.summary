by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 19 december 2012 a sanctuary that has cared for unwanted animals for 64 years may be forced into the heartbreaking decision to put down all its dogs – because of one complaint about barking			1
twin sisters @entity7 and @entity8 have been issued with a council noise abatement order which they say they can not afford to comply with			1
it means they must find homes for their 17 dogs or have them destroyed			2
they fear they may even be forced to close @entity16 , which is also home to 10 cows , 10 ponies , seven pigs , five sheep , five llamas and three goats			1
tragic : @entity8 of @entity16 admits 17 dogs like @entity25 face being put down because a council said their barks are too loud the 70 - year - old sisters say the complaint from a neighbour about the barking is the only brush with authority they have had since they started the sanctuary in 1948			1
despite this , their local council issued the noise abatement order and told them to put up a soundproof perimeter fence			1
unfortunately , their registered charity can not afford to fight the order in court and does n’t have the funds to pay for fencing			1
the sanctuary , in @entity46 , @entity47 , costs £ 3,000 a week to run and , although they receive donations , the sisters and their husbands prop it up with their own cash			0
mrs @entity54 , whose husband @entity55 , 64 , works as a driver , said : ‘ we have a no - destruction policy			2
if we ca n’t rehome our animals , they stay with us until they die of old age			2
we have never turned any away			0
‘ but as things stand , we may have to put the dogs down and we could be forced to close for good			1
‘ we do not have enough funds to pay for a lengthy legal fight and in any case we feel the money is better spent caring for the animals			2
’ mrs @entity54 denied the dogs barked ‘ all day , every day ’ and insisted the sisters try to keep noise to a minimum			1
‘ we are in a quiet spot on a country lane , it ’s not as if we are in a built - up area , ’ she said			2
‘ the dogs do bark from time to time , all dogs bark			2
’ attack : patch may have to be destroyed before @entity83 all because a single member of the public complained shame : the sanctuary can not afford to fight the noise abatement notice brought against them , which makes the future bleak for animals like @entity92 and 16 others home : the sanctuary has cared for thousands of animals like @entity96 , pictured , since 1948 mrs @entity8 and her mechanic husband @entity98 , 55 , live in @entity100 and say some of the dogs have recently been moved from heated kennels to the house to reduce the noise to neighbours			1
' we have been here for 64 years and have cared for thousands of animals in that time – no one has ever complained before , ’ mrs @entity8 said			1
‘ we do our very best to ensure the noise is kept down			2
however , i have to concede that the dogs do bark from time to time			0
but it ’s not like that all day every day as the person who has complained is claiming			0
’ the sisters say that , with @entity83 approaching , they expect to have more unwanted pets to look after in the coming weeks			0
home : the sanctuary has been asked to put up sound proof fencing - but they just ca n't afford it sad : the home , which has taken animals from all over @entity125 , has a no destruction policy but may have to shut leaving them with no other option ‘ we ca n’t turn them away			1
putting up a fence is not a priority , ’ said mrs @entity54			0
the sisters lived in @entity100 with their parents as children and were brought up with pet dogs and cats			0
in 1948 , the family saved a young pony called @entity140 because a neighbour was sending her to be slaughtered			0
she lived for another 25 years			0
the girls were only six when they took on @entity140 and soon other unwanted ponies arrived and the sanctuary developed			0
both sisters later had clerical jobs and used their money to run the sanctuary , which became a charity in 1982			0
over the years they have taken in animals from all over the country , from the @entity151 to the @entity152			0
heartbreak : @entity25 ( left ) and @entity153 ( right ) and 15 other dogs face being put down thanks to the sole complaint cuddle : rescued dogs @entity159 ( left ) and @entity25 are cared for alongside a whole host of other saved animals desperate : @entity8 holds @entity153 and is keen to solve a problem that could lead to innocent deaths serious : @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity25 are unaware that there lives could be short thanks to an order brought by one complaint mrs @entity54 said : ‘ we just love animals , we always have , and so did our parents			1
‘ when word got around that we had taken in a couple of ponies people starting contacting us about neglected animals and some were left at our gate			0
' over the years the animals took over our lives			0
‘ we do n’t have the money to fight this case and we do fear the dogs will have to be put to sleep unless something can be done			1
’ a @entity47 council spokesman said : ‘ a noise abatement order has been issued against the animal sanctuary			1
the owners initially appealed and then withdrew their appeal			0
‘ we are now working with the owners to help them comply with the order			1
’ anyone wanting to offer a home to any of the sanctuary ’s animals should call 07980 992589 .			0

@entity16 faces closure after council court order
owners of the charity admit they ca n't afford to fight noise notice
' as it stands we will be forced to have to put the dogs down and we could even close for good , ' owner @entity8 said
@entity210 want them to install sound - proof fencing
