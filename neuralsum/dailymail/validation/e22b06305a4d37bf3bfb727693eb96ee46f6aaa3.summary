the @entity1 diet : people who adopted the eating plan were 47 per cent less likely to develop heart disease over a 10 year period a @entity8 diet is more protective against heart disease than exercise , a new study has revealed			1
those who stuck to the diet , consisting of fresh fruit and vegetables , whole grains , nuts , beans , olive oil , fish and even a glass of red wine were 47 per cent less likely to develop heart disease over a 10 year period			1
the study , from @entity24 in @entity25 , is the first to track 10 - year heart disease risk in a general population			1
most previous studies have focused on middle - aged people			0
the study , presented at the @entity32 's annual conference , is based on data from a representative sample of more than 2,500 @entity36 adults , aged between 18 to 89 , they provided researchers with health information on themselves each year from 2001 to 2012			2
nearly one in five of the men and 12 per cent of the women developed or died from heart disease , including stroke , coronary heart disease and heart attack			2
the researchers scored participants ' diets on a scale from 1 to 55 based on their self - reported frequency and level of intake from 11 food groups			0
those who scored in the top - third in terms of adherence to the @entity8 diet were 47 percent less likely to develop heart disease over the 10 - year follow - up period ( compared to participants who scored in the bottom - third )			1
each one - point increase in the dietary score was associated with a three percent drop in heart disease risk			1
this difference was independent of other heart disease risk factors including age , gender , family history , education level , body mass index , smoking habits , hypertension , diabetes and high cholesterol			1
women tended to follow the @entity8 diet more closely than men , the researchers noted			0
study author , professor @entity77 , said : ' our study shows the @entity8 diet is a beneficial intervention for all types of people in both genders , in all age groups , and in both healthy people and those with health conditions			0
' adherence to the @entity8 diet was more protective than physical activity			0
' it also reveals the @entity8 diet has direct benefits for heart health , in addition to its indirect benefits in managing diabetes , hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and inflammation			0
protective : the @entity8 diet comprises fresh fruit and vegetables , whole grains , nuts , beans , olive oil , fish and red wine ' because the @entity8 diet is based on food groups that are quite common or easy to find , people around the world could easily adopt this dietary pattern and help protect themselves against heart disease with very little cost			1
' the researchers admitted that because the study was limited to @entity36 living in the @entity25 area it might not reflect the health patterns of other countries			0
but they did point out that urbanised @entity36 were eating a more western diet , similar to that of @entity121			0
the analysis also confirmed results of previous studies indicating that male gender , older age , diabetes and a measure of inflammation are associated with an increased risk for heart disease			2
earlier research has shown that following the traditional @entity8 diet is linked to weight loss , reduced risk of diabetes , lower blood pressure and lower blood cholesterol levels , in addition to reduced risk of heart disease .			2

@entity36 who followed the diet were 47 *%* less likely to develop heart disease
study is the first to track 10 - year heart disease risk in a general population
*staples* of the diet include fresh fruit and vegetables , whole grains , nuts , beans , olive oil and fish - ' easily obtainable foods ' , the researchers note
