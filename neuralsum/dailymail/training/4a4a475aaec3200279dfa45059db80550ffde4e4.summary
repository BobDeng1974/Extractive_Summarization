' recently these efforts were rewarded and @entity9 received the good news that he has permission to stay here and make a new start			1
' immigration judge @entity85 ruled that kicking @entity9 out of the country would be in breach of @entity88 of human rights laws and the right to respect for private and family life			1

@entity31 has given me a new life			2
' the @entity2 man won his battle in february and is staying at the retreat centre			2
however , he still has to report to police regularly			0
new life : @entity107 's church near the @entity108 in @entity33 where @entity9 has lived since his release from prison @entity9 is the latest in a long line of convicted criminals to successfully use @entity114 laws to argue that deportation would breach their right to a private and family life			1

still here : @entity18 who was told in 2007 that he would be deported to @entity6 the 26 - year - old was placed on the sex offenders register for an assault committed after the @entity127 stopped his deportation from @entity7 it ruled the asylum seeker , who wears a @entity28 tag on his ankle , can not be sent back to his native country while civil war rages			1

@entity18 , from @entity145 , @entity146 said : ' i have been here since i was eight , i can hardly speak @entity6			1
i do n't remember my motherland			2
they 'll see me as " this rich kid from @entity151 "			0
' i have been placed in a box by the immigration department , a box that is on fire			2
i am being treated like a pet dog			0
if you tell a pet dog to stay in that room , it will stay in that room			0
' yet @entity18 , who has a 20 strong family in @entity146 , has hardly been a model citizen			1
as a juvenile , he was twice placed on probation for shoplifting before receiving three years for street robbery			2
' it was a stupid , irrational thing to do , ' he said			0
' it does not shine a good light on me , but i was high on cannabis			0

@entity18 was told he must leave in 2007 but has appealed			2
he was convicted of criminal damage in 2009 and jailed for 12 weeks in 2011 for a sexual assault			0
but @entity18 believes he is the victim			2
' i am not trying to deny i have a criminal past , ' he said			0
' my argument is , had i been given some form of access to do something productive when i was released things would have been different			0
i ca n't even do voluntary work			1
' there were two co-defendants in the robbery case and they now have jobs , cars and homes			0
i was not given that opportunity			0
i am 26 and my life is on hold			2
yes , i made a mistake			0
why was i not given the opportunity to repent ? ' there are rapists and paedophiles being released and they are re-offending			0
how can i be deported for one mistake ? ' @entity18 boasted about how he drunkenly begged a teenage girl on a bus for sex			2
@entity18 , who has never worked , said : ' all i did was ask a girl if she wanted sex			2
' i was paralytic after a house party and was on the bus sitting near a really fit girl			0
' she was 17 , maybe 18			0
i touched her on the shoulder and said something like " hey why do n't you come round to my house for sexual intercourse ? " ' it was harmless fun			0
i should n't have done it and i pleaded guilty to sexual assault			0
' what man does n't want to have sex with a pretty girl when they 're drunk ? ' in 2011 @entity18 was jailed for his part in a vicious street robbery			1
he added : ' i was on a bus with friends when we got abused by a man for no reason			0
the argument escalated into a fight which ended up being a robbery			0
' i had no intention of taking part in the robbery but it just @entity235 was in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
' @entity18 was born in @entity6 but left when he was four years old and eventually arrived in @entity7 when he was aged eight			1
he said : ' i consider myself @entity7 , i deserve to be allowed to stay here			0
' my life was over after i came out of the young offender 's institute because i wanted to be a youth worker but my conviction put me in breach of my immigration agreement			2
' the @entity28 are believed to still be making efforts to have him sent back to his homeland			0
a @entity28 spokesperson said : ' we take all necessary steps to deport people who break our laws and in 2012 we removed 4,500 foreign national offenders			0
' however , deportation can be delayed when offenders seek to frustrate the process or challenge us on human rights grounds			1
that is why we have now changed the rules to make it harder for convicted criminals to dodge deportation in the courts			2
