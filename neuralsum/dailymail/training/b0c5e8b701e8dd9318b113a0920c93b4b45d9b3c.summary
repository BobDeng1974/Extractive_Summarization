i was the man who had everything			2
i made a fortune , married a beautiful wife , had five children , and then fulfilled my lifelong ambition			2
ever since my school days i wanted to be a politician			2
my election to represent my @entity11 constituency of @entity12 in 2005 was one of the proudest moments of my life			1
so too was joining the government as @entity17			2
now my political career is in ruins			2
i have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues			1
many will regard me as a failure			2
@entity26 mp @entity25 said he has ' traumatised ' his family after it emerged he sent explicit pictures to two women , pictured with his wife @entity31 and it is true : behind the outward facade of success and achievement , i have been battling demons – and losing to them			1
i craved adrenaline and risk			2
stress at work drove me to increasingly erratic behaviour			1
my friends warned me that i was cracking up			2
late at night , i began a series of flirtations in response to approaches from women on social media			2
deep inside , i knew i was playing with fire			2
now it has consumed me and my family			1
when a newspaper exposed one of these episodes – involving a male freelance reporter using stolen pictures to impersonate a young female @entity26 activist – i stood down as a minister			1
now , in response to what seems to be a new text - and - tell story , i am standing down as an mp at the next election			1
the mp began a series of flirtations in response to approaches from women on social media i want to concentrate on slaying those demons – making me , i hope , a better husband and father , and giving me a chance to contribute in some way to the country in future			1
true , i made big sacrifices for my career , leaving a highly paid job in finance to dedicate myself to the day - to - day concerns of my constituents in @entity12			1
many of my counterparts from @entity85 and @entity86 days mocked me for this			0
i tried to explain to them that i wanted to give back : using my privilege and education to help people solve their daily problems – helping them navigate the bureaucratic maze on issues such as welfare and housing , and ensuring that @entity12 had its own community hospital			0
what is the point of making millions when you can change the lives of thousands ? but a far greater price was paid by my family			1
all too often i was an absent dad , arriving home late at night when the children were in bed			1
i missed family meals , holidays and vital moments in their lives			1
i will never get those back			0
worse , i was emotionally absent , seeking the buzz of achievement when i should have been dealing with the concerns of those nearest and dearest to me : my wife above all			1
the illusion of success in the @entity121 bubble blinded me to reality			0
exchanging flirty pictures online is no substitute for the love and companionship that a real marriage offers			1
i still look back with pride on my campaign to reduce youth unemployment , setting up an education charity in @entity132 and my efforts to encourage women into public life			0
amid the wreckage of my political career , it is some comfort to know that this work was not in vain			1
these causes will remain close to my heart and i will do what i can to further them even when i am no longer in @entity145			0
i will continue to represent my constituents until the @entity147 in may			0
but i am seeking help now			0
i will be beginning residential psychiatric treatment for the next few weeks in the hope that professional help will enable me to salvage my life and my family			1
i would like to use this terrible moment in my life to appeal to others who are ashamed of their mental ill - health to seek help before it is too late			1
i have long argued in @entity145 against the stigma which we too often attach to mental illness			0
but i did not practise what i preached			0
i talked about my anorexia as a teenager , yet i was never brave enough to admit first that i was suffering from depression , or that i was lapsing into episodes of behaviour that any normal person would regard as bizarre and abhorrent			0
i realise now – too late – that i need treatment			1
he stood down as a minister after the @entity172 revealed he had sent explicit pictures to a fake account many of my friends have advised me to ‘ tough this out ’			1
after all , they say , i have not broken any law			0
i have not stolen any money			0
many other politicians have done far worse things to their families – and their careers have survived and even flourished			0
i have received countless messages of support – from all political quarters and none – along these lines in recent days , and i am profoundly grateful for them			0
but for me that is not the point			0
i do not want to be a battle - scarred veteran of @entity121 politics			1
i want to be a person who brings happiness to those around me – and thus to myself			0
that can come only if i change			0
i do not blame the media for my downfall			0
it is for others to judge their behaviour and their ethics			0
the fault is mine alone			0
if i had sought help earlier , none of this would have happened			0
but i do hope that the media will leave me and my family alone as we try to rebuild our lives .			1
