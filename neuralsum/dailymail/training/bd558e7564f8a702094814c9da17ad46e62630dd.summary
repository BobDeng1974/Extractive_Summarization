by @entity0 @entity1 heads list of @entity4 targets as @entity7 semi-finalists chase @entity5 , @entity8 and @entity9 @entity10 have joined the race for @entity13 defender @entity12 but will face a difficult task prising him away			1
@entity16 also have an interest in the 19 - year - old , who is being tipped as an outsider for @entity22 's @entity21 training squad			1
stones was bought from @entity24 by @entity25 in january 2013 for a £ 3million fee , heading off interest from then - @entity29 manager @entity28 and sir @entity30 at @entity31			1
although he was playing as a right back , @entity25 and @entity28 recognised @entity23 would become a centre back and he is showing how in his performances of late			0
@entity16 have watched the @entity36 defender closely and like his ability to bring the ball out of defence which has come to the fore this season			2
in demand : @entity13 defender @entity12 is wanted by both @entity45 giants , @entity10 and @entity16 @entity10 have good youth players coming through but @entity23 is ahead of them after gaining @entity48 experience			1
both clubs would like to make an offer but @entity13 are not looking to sell any of their stars as they continue to make giant strides towards @entity7 qualification			0
whereas in the past they would be vulnerable to any sizeable bid , the club is utilising increased tv money to stabilise and build for the future			1
@entity59 is also inevitably wanted by @entity48 rivals but @entity13 believe the player wants to stay at @entity62 for at least another two years before taking stock of where to take his career			0
by that time they hope to have added more than @entity7 qualification to convince him to stay			0
staying put : @entity13 are confident the much - coveted @entity59 intends to stay at @entity62 for a while yet @entity70 scouts are due in @entity71 this week to watch @entity72			1
the 20 - year - old forward , valued at £ 6miilion , is due to play for @entity74 against @entity75			1
@entity70 are ready to bring in around four new players ahead of their @entity48 campaign with a right back and goalkeeper also on their wishlist			0
manager @entity80 is keen on @entity82 's 24 - year - old @entity81			1
the @entity84 defender has rejected new terms at his club and is poised to move to @entity36 , although @entity16 have also watched him in recent months			2
@entity87 : @entity70 are planning for life in the @entity48 with signings such as @entity72 ( centre ) @entity92 , @entity16 and @entity13 scouts were all present at @entity94 's 2 - 0 home defeat to @entity82 on sunday			1
the game was far from spectacular by all accounts with @entity82 defenders @entity97 and @entity81 on the scoresheet			0
@entity13 and @entity92 though have been particularly keen on other @entity82 defenders @entity101 and @entity102			1
both are expected to be sold this summer			0
being monitored : @entity92 , @entity16 and @entity13 scouts saw @entity102 ( left ) and @entity101 in action @entity105 have resumed talks over potential deals for @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity110 of @entity111 but look likely to miss out on @entity108 in particular with his wage demands too high			1
@entity108 , 34 , has stated this weekend that he is ready to stay at @entity109 and that may not be too surprising with his salary at around £ 75,000 a week and the @entity115 will offer two years			2
@entity110 is understood to be looking for similar terms to leave @entity117 for the @entity48 after turning down a new contract at @entity111			2
@entity119 targets : @entity105 are hoping to bring in both @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity111 's @entity110 both players are out of contract and free to talk to interested clubs abroad			1
@entity123 , who has scored 12 goals in 28 matches for @entity109 this season , told @entity127 : ' my thought is to stay on at @entity109			0
i am expecting to remain at @entity130 and be a part of this squad also in the new @entity119 1 season			0
' @entity110 , 26 , has interest also from @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 - although the latter are struggling financially			2
@entity139 are looking for new takers for @entity141 after @entity142 indicated he would be returning to @entity143 's in the summer			1
@entity142 coach @entity144 said : ' i can only speak highly of @entity141 because he works hard and settled into the group well			0
he will give us a hand from here to the end of the season so we can achieve our objectives			0
' @entity139 had agreed a loan with view to a permanent £ 15.6million deal but will now be looking to see if there is interest from @entity157 and other @entity159 clubs once he returns in the summer			2
unwanted : @entity139 are desperate to get rid of @entity141 , whose loan at @entity142 is soon ending saints will be looking for new forwards to replace @entity141 and possibly others			2
@entity165 and @entity16 are both keen on @entity166 although his knee injury may ensure he stays another season while @entity165 remain interested in a deal for @entity170 also			0
however , @entity31 are unlikely to pursue a deal for the @entity36 midfielder at this stage			0
@entity174 is also expected to return to @entity175 @entity29 are the latest club to show a firm interest in @entity178 centre back @entity177			0
manager @entity179 has had scouts check on the 21 - year - old , who has also been monitored by @entity92 and @entity16 this season			1
@entity179 also wants a right back with @entity177 's team - mate @entity184 a possibility			0
@entity179 had wanted to strike a deal for @entity188 's @entity187 but the 27 - year - old looks destined to sign for @entity190 instead			1
under observation : @entity178 defender @entity177 ( centre ) is interesting @entity29 boss @entity179			0

@entity10 have joined the race to sign young @entity13 defender @entity12
@entity16 are also interested in the 19 year - old *toffee*
@entity13 boss @entity28 is *unwilling* to let the former @entity24 man leave , while increased tv money means the @entity201 can reject offers
@entity70 have sent scouts to watch @entity74 's @entity72
@entity92 , @entity16 and @entity13 monitor @entity94 defenders @entity101 and @entity102
@entity105 resume talks with @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity110 of @entity111
@entity139 determined to get shot of @entity141 this summer
