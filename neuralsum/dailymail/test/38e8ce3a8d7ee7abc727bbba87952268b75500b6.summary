@entity0 had a blissfully happy childhood running around care - fee with her seven siblings in their backyard in regional @entity5			1
although she was adopted from @entity7 along with two of her siblings , it never occurred to her that she should explore her origins in @entity7 , where she was born before being adopted and starting a new life in the @entity12 as an eight month old baby			1
but that all changed when she watched the movie @entity15 and realised how profoundly different her life would have been if her new parents did n't take her in their arms and change her life forever			1
the film was nothing short of life - changing for @entity0 and led her to a fulfilling spiritual journey back to where it all began in an orphanage in the slums of @entity7 - the country she instantly fell in love with and has become her second home			1
' it was the first time i really understood what could have happened if i had n't been adopted			0
' and the fact that the little girl in the movie had my name - i have never heard of anyone with my name before - it was really extraordinary			2
' it took @entity0 another three years to make it to @entity7 in 2012 and she has been every year since - admitting to being ' absolutely obsessed ' with her mother country			1
' i never had any sense of a part of me that was missing had been filled but i felt fuller as a person - i got that part of my story i had never known			0

' it was a spiritual homecoming - by the end of the last couple of days that i stayed there i definitely felt like it was my home , ' she said			2
the orphanage is now run as a centre to help the disadvantaged and educates young girls , but the nuns have kept a book with a handwritten record of the day she arrived and then when she was handed over to her adoptive parents			2
although the details were very brief , along with with two back and white head shots , and do n't provide any clues to where @entity0 had come from , she was over the moon			2
' it 's incredible that a few sentences and some ruled lines can mean anything but it did , it was just wow - a " this is me " moment - i cried happy tears , ' she said			0
' it was the first time i felt that connection had been forged because suddenly i was in this different country and there 's me - my name in this book written 30 years ago it was amazing			0

she will feel eternally grateful to the nuns who cared for her as a defenceless tiny baby when nobody else could in the poverty - stricken state of @entity70			0
' the nuns said they were sorry that they did n't have any more information but back then they were just so focused on trying to look after the babies and place them into loving homes - they just did n't think that these children would come back , ' she said			0
' it was a humbling experience to see that was my beginning and that i have so much to thank them for			0
' it was really lovely to just see the value and the loving start that i had been given which i had always appreciated but never fully comprehended until i was there			0
