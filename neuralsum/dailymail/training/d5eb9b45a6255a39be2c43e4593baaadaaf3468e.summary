feathered dinosaurs may have learned to fly before the evolution of birds , a new fossil find suggests			2
the long tail feathers of the @entity5 , a ' four - winged ' dinosaur from @entity7 , would have provided stability and speed control for a safe landing			1
measuring 4ft ( 1.2 metres ) long and weighing 9lbs ( 4kg ) , the creature lived 125 million years ago , and was the biggest dinosaur of its type ever discovered			1
the well - preserved fossil ( pictured ) shows that a full set of feathers cloaked the entire body of the @entity5			2
' four - winged ' dinosaurs , known as microraptorines , are so called because the long feathers attached to their legs have the appearance of a second set of wings the well - preserved fossil , unearthed in @entity27 in northeastern @entity7 , shows that a full set of feathers cloaked its entire body			1
' four - winged ' dinosaurs , known as microraptorines , are so called because the long feathers attached to their legs have the appearance of a second set of wings			2
although birds have a dinosaur ancestry , dinosaurs themselves were thought to have stayed on the ground , despite some of them sporting rudimentary feathers			2
the @entity5 discovery blurs the lines between dinosaurs and the first early birds such as the magpie - sized @entity44			0
for larger flyers , safe landings are of particular importance - hence the significance of the tail feathers			1
the well - preserved fossil , unearthed in @entity27 in northeastern @entity7 , shows that a full set of feathers cloaked its entire body			1
in comparison with its body size , the foot - long tail feathers were unusually long			1
' four - winged ' dinosaurs , known as microraptorines , are so called because the long feathers attached to their legs have the appearance of a second set of wings			0
in fact , the well - developed feathers on both legs and arms have led scientists to wonder if the creatures were capable of flight			0
dr @entity68 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , one of the authors of the new research published in the journal @entity74 , said : ' numerous features that we have long associated with birds in fact evolved in dinosaurs long before the first birds arrived on the scene			0
' this includes things such as hollow bones , nesting behaviour , feathers , and possibly flight			0
' during the reign of the dinosaurs , flight evolved both in birds and pterosaurs - reptiles that included some creatures the size of a small aircraft			0
the well - preserved fossil was unearthed in @entity27 in northeastern @entity7 ( marked at a ) measuring 4ft ( 1.2 metres ) long and weighing 9lbs ( 4kg ) , @entity5 ( illustration pictured ) is the biggest dinosaur of its type yet discovered			1
in comparison with its body size , the tail feathers were unusually long			1
the discovery blurs the lines between dinosaurs and the first early birds such as the magpie - sized archaeopteryx although birds have a dinosaur ancestry , dinosaurs themselves were thought to have stayed on the ground , despite some of them sporting rudimentary feathers			0

' it makes sense that the largest microraptorines had especially large tail feathers , they would have needed the additional control , ' said co-author dr @entity129 , from the @entity130			2
' the new fossil documents that dinosaur flight was not limited to very small animals but to dinosaurs of more substantial size , ' said study leader dr @entity136 , from the @entity137 of @entity138			0
' clearly far more evidence is needed to understand the nuances of dinosaur flight , but @entity142 is a major leap in the right direction			0

the fossil of the @entity5 was unearthed in @entity27 , @entity7
its tail feathers would have provided stability and control for a safe landing
@entity154 is said to have been 4ft ( 1.2 metres ) long and weighed 9lbs ( 4kg )
the feathered creature lived 125 million years ago , and was the biggest dinosaur of its type ever discovered
