former party chairman @entity17 said the prime minister and @entity19 relied too much on advisers who lack ‘ experience or much understanding of the party or politics ’			1
and he warned that @entity31 ’s ‘ cash for access ’ row and the fuel strike panic had reinforced the view that mr @entity8 was ‘ born to privilege ’			1
growing numbers of disgruntled conservative mps have also accused the prime minister and mr @entity9 of being out of touch with the party and @entity14 voters			1
@entity38 , a former parliamentary private secretary , said there was concern ‘ that the government is being run by a clique ’ and called for more people with ‘ principles and integrity ’			0
the influential @entity46 of @entity14 backbenchers has warned mr @entity8 he needs to make major changes to the way he runs his government			1

the prime minister ’s personal rating – the difference between the number of voters who think he is doing a good job and those who do not – plunged to -27 in the latest @entity70 poll			0
writing in @entity71 , @entity17 said mr @entity8 ’s carefully orchestrated public relations photo opportunities such as cycling to work , and not wearing a tie to black tie dinners , will not make voters forget his background of wealth and privilege			1

he drives the liberal elite agenda			1
’ unsatisfied : both @entity107 , left and @entity114 , right , criticised @entity9 and @entity8 scandal : disgraced @entity116 , pictured left with prime minister @entity8 mp , was forced to resign over his ' cash - for - access ' boasts in an apparent reference to the feuding between @entity121 and @entity122 , she took to @entity123 to add : ‘ history is teaching us that when you have a chancellor who is more interested in becoming prime minister , he messes up			1
’ criticising mr @entity9 ’s ‘ self - appointed ’ dual role as chancellor and head of conservative political strategy , she said : ‘ it ’s about influence controlling outcomes , not letting others shine ensuring own succession			2
’ mr @entity38 said : ‘ @entity8 would do well to take on board the criticism			2
the tone and tenor of his leadership is in danger of sending the wrong signal to @entity146 voters			0
we need less lords reform and gay marriage and more reducing taxes for ordinary voters , giving small business a leg - up and telling the @entity155 courts where to go on @entity156			0
‘ people are very concerned that the government is being run by a clique			0
we need more authentic voices and less teenage scribblers at @entity162			0

’ @entity202 , another @entity114 mp , warned that his disgruntled colleagues risked ‘ compromising ’ the party			2
he said : ‘ there should be constant challenge to the leadership , it should n’t start from the position of dislike for the prime minister			0
’ but @entity14 mp @entity114 said mr @entity8 should hold an early reshuffle to promote more ministers from state schools and working - class homes ‘ to make the government a little less foie gras and a little more fish and chips ’			1
