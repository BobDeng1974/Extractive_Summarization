by @entity1 reporter published : 17:29 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 17:36 est , 29 november 2012 at first glance these beautiful images appear to show a frozen river caked in fresh snow			2
but these photographs actually reveal the shocking extent of pollution of the @entity9 in @entity10 that has caused a thick layer of foam to completely cover it			1
parts of the @entity9 are now described as a ' dead river ' meaning the pollution level is so bad that there is not enough oxygen in it for fish or other marine life to survive			1
other worshippers can be seen making their way through the foam on small wooden boats or carrying out prayers by the water 's edge			0
the images show poor water quality of the @entity9 despite efforts by the @entity10 government to rectify the situation			1
@entity10 has spent almost £ 200 million on unsuccessful schemes to clean the river , which is revered by @entity24 and still plays an important role in many religious ceremonies			1
most of the pollution is centered around @entity30 where 18 drains dump 600 million gallons of sewage in the river every year			2
as well as industrial waste from local factories , locals also wash their clothes and utensils in the river			0
field of ice : at first glance , it appears these @entity24 are crossing a frozen river steady now : worshipers make their way to shore after travelling across the foam - coated @entity9 river fireside : groups of @entity24 light candles and small fires by the side of the river as part of the ceremony a 600km stretch of the river surrounding @entity30 has been declared dead - similar to the @entity89 55 years ago before efforts were made to clean it up			1
the @entity9 's polluted stretch was about 500km - from @entity93 in @entity30 to @entity94 in @entity95 - according to @entity96 ( @entity97 ) 's 2010 data			2
but latest data show the pollution now starts from @entity101 in @entity102 , almost 100km upstream of @entity93			0
scientists have also recently raised concerns about the risks of the river infecting food produce grown nearby with an insecticide called @entity110 , widely used in mosquito repellents			0
if not washed properly before being cooked , the chemical can remain in the vegetables and fruits grown on the river 's floodplains and enter the human body			0
residents of settlements along the river who use the contaminated water for washing , cooking , bathing and drinking , continue to be susceptible to diseases			0
devoted : a @entity24 covered in foam lights incense sticks after going for a swim in the @entity9 earlier this month , @entity24 performed rituals during @entity132 , an ancient @entity24 festival popular amongst the working class , to thank the @entity134 for sustaining life on earth polluted : several million tonnes of sewerage are dumped into the @entity9 every day ' dead ' river : the section of the @entity9 surrounding @entity30 is so polluted that there is no longer enough oxygen in it for marine life to survive			1
