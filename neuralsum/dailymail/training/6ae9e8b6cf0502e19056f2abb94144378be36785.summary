' i ’m not sure what their interests are , but it ’s certainly not us			0
' ' it was just deplorable			2
a shot of a moldy carton of fruit punch ( pictured ) is the most disturbing thirsty ? : students claim the water from the drinking fountain comes out brown , yellow , grey or cloudy , but the school district says it has passed safety tests yummy : a cockroach is seen here on the side of a milk carton mold : of particular concern is the state of the bathrooms , which appear moldy and damp the disturbing photos quickly went viral and have outraged many , especially parents			1
