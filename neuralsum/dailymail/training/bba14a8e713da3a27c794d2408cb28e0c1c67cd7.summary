by @entity0 with @entity3 's strict asylum seeker policy putting an effective stop to boat arrivals , indonesian people smugglers have set their sights on another ' safe haven '			1
more than 8,000 kilometres away , beyond the treacherous waters of the @entity9 and the fickle @entity10 , lies @entity11 , a country whose shores have so far remained untouched by any refugee boat			1
various separate plans to attempt the journey have so far been thwarted , with some never making it past @entity18 while others collapse at the early planning stages , still in @entity21			2
@entity11 is the the new ideal location for the approximate 100,000 refugees currently in limbo in @entity21 , after crackdowns in @entity3 render seeking asylum in the closer country impossible but a joint investigation by @entity29 and @entity11 's @entity30 , has revealed that , as desperation mounts amongst the 100,000 plus asylum seekers currently in @entity21 and with more arriving every day , smugglers continue to try and win over the wallets of those who are frantic to resettle			1
part of the desperation for the 100 or so refugees that arrive each day , is their instant move into limbo , due to @entity21 not being a signatory of the @entity41			0
this means they are dubbed illegal and are unable to work or educate their children , leaving them with the option of remaining in @entity21 with a minute chance of resettlement , returning to the home they fled or risk a spell in one of @entity3 's detention centres			2
feeding off of these anxieties , are people smugglers , who offer the faint hope of a fourth option : @entity11			0
one @entity60 travel agent , who now resides in @entity61 , @entity21 , has most recently been one of the culprits behind a ploy to smuggle 50 @entity9 , @entity65 , @entity60 and @entity66 refugees out of the town of @entity68 and onto a boat bound for @entity70 and finally @entity71 , in @entity11 's north - west , @entity29 reports			1
@entity11 's @entity21 ambassador @entity72 is skeptical about the small refugee boat 's ability to successfully make the 8,000km journey from @entity21 , as no refugee boat has ever reached its shores to date for the price of $ 500 @entity80 up front , and about $ 5000 @entity80 in total , the organisation offered the asylum seekers passage on an metal - hulled , 32m - long and 7m - high boat which he termed ' safe ' for the treacherous voyage			1
the smugglers also claim a second boat would follow close behind as back up as they travelled along the @entity21 coast , and as far as @entity70 where the larger boat would be re-provisioned and the smaller support vessel would return to @entity92			0
they told the passengers that the journey would take 10 - 12 days , but ensured them that @entity11 would accept the refugees if the boat made it to its destination			2
the plan was thwarted however when the refugees were intercepted by police after a suspected tip - off			0
the most recent @entity11 bound boat , which planned to follow a route similar to the one pictured , was thwarted by @entity21 officials on wednesday @entity11 's @entity21 ambassador , @entity72 , says the smugglers ' grand promises are all dangerous lies			1
' the boats these people - smugglers are using are mainly wooden , small , they 're not ocean fit and they 're overcrowded			0
it 's a pipe dream that they 're going to be able to get to @entity11 , ' he said			0
' some [ smugglers ] say " we 'll get you to @entity11 " not actually intending to get there because they know they ca n't , [ they 're ] hoping to get to a certain point then duck into @entity3 , so it 's part of their marketing strategy			1
' in a tape obtained by @entity30 , a money changer said the following about a proposed voyage to @entity11 : ' all passengers are waiting for getting one boat through			0
if one boat through , proved getting to @entity11 , more will go			0

@entity3 's strict asylum seeker policies have *deterred* refugees
short on *business* , smugglers are keen to successfully get one boat to @entity11 to spike new interest
treacherous 8,000 kilometre journey considered impossible and dangerous
most recent attempt of 50 refugees heading to @entity141 on wednesday , thwarted
