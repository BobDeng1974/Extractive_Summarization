@entity1 's @entity0 made a flying start to set the early pace in the first round of the @entity5 in @entity6 on thursday			1
@entity0 took advantage of ideal conditions to birdie the first three holes on the @entity10 at @entity11 , moving to three under par and into a one - shot lead over @entity15 @entity14 and @entity17 's @entity16			0
@entity17 trio @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 were a shot further back , with @entity20 recovering from a bogey at the first with birdies from eight and three feet at the third and fifth respectively			0
@entity34 has not played since finishing second to @entity20 in the @entity43 in the first week of october , the 25 - year - old withdrawing from scheduled appearances in the first two @entity41 events in @entity42 to prepare for his upcoming court case with a former management company			2

to say i 'm excited is an understatement			0
