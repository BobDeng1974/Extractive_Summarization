@entity1 's running on the third day of pre-season testing stopped just before lunch because of a problem with @entity7 ’s @entity6 engine			1
testing can be an event for sitting around drinking coffee and the like			2
and @entity1 ’s drivers have had more time to do that than they would care for this week			2
@entity7 encountered problems with his @entity6 during day three of pre-season testing @entity7 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) have been restricted to just six laps each on the first two days but the mechanics have had a busy time			1
a night - shift worked hard on monday to rectify the problems that limited @entity7 and @entity14 to just six laps each on the first two days in @entity20			1
it seemed as if they had turned a corner on tuesday , as @entity7 put in 32 laps before the gremlins struck			1
‘ he had just begun a timed run when he felt something awry with the car , ’ said a @entity1 spokesman			2
‘ he returned the car to the garage , where we discovered a loss of cooling water pressure			2
fixing the issue required the removal of the power unit — a lengthy change that we could n’t have completed in time for the car to return to the track today			0
‘ nevertheless , it ’s a fixable problem , and we ’ll get things replaced ahead of @entity14 ’s final run in the car tomorrow			1
’ @entity45 drives his mercedes around the track during day three of the testing in @entity20 @entity1 were 14 seconds off the pace set by @entity50 of @entity51			1
but the @entity53 team remain optimistic of being strong by the first race in @entity55 on march 15 , despite @entity6 only returning to the sport this year , 12 months after all their rival engine manufacturers began to compete under the new regulations			1
while @entity46 continued to clock up more miles than anyone else , @entity59 are happy with their progress			0
driver @entity63 said the car was a ‘ completely different story ’ from last year ’s			0
he added : ‘ there are a lot of good points in the areas where we had difficulties last time			0
@entity45 talks to the media after day three of the 2015 @entity74 pre-season testing ‘ it ’s early days and the circuit mostly stayed damp today , but we had good running and got some mileage			1
’ @entity46 ’ @entity45 , who was third fastest behind @entity50 and @entity63 , added his voice to the positive noises , saying the @entity59 ’s pace was an ‘ eye - opener ’			0
@entity63 ’s contract is due to expire at the end of the season , with @entity87 a possible candidate to replace him			0
@entity63 , a placid @entity89 , merely said : ‘ if it goes badly and i do n’t sign it , then i do n’t sign it			0
it ’s not the @entity94			0
