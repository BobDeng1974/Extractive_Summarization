village clubs have been pushed off a former barracks they used as a meeting place – for the @entity5 army			1
@entity6 has hosted cadet groups , a golf club and a winter sports club since the last @entity11 soldiers left it last year			1
but the site is now set to host 2,000 @entity5 troops for training before they are deployed back to the @entity16 country			1
quiet : @entity17 in @entity18 usually only hosts village clubs it means local families who have come to rely on the facilities for their clubs will now have to find new homes			2
despite the blow the @entity25 has said the decision may well not be permanent and it would review the situation after the first round of training			2
the clubs based at the barracks have been barred from using the land for their usual activities since march , although the first @entity5 soldiers will arrive at the end of 2013			1
@entity37 has already decided to close as a result of the ban			0
@entity40 , which has its own slope in the barracks and has been operating for decades , is in talks about buying its part of the site - but any deal will rely on them securing their own access			0
club secretary @entity49 said : ' as we have yet to find out the purchase price and cost of alternate access and whether or not the club ’s members think this is affordable , we share the concerns of the other clubs about the future use of the barracks			0
' statebuilding : @entity5 troops will train in @entity18 before they are deployed back to the @entity16 country colonel @entity62 , commanding officer of the @entity63 , said : ' the clubs that use the base were given notice when the project to train the @entity5 personnel came upon us			1

he said : ' it is a big blow for the area			0
