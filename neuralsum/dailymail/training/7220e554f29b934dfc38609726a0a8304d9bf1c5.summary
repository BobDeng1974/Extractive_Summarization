our ageing population means that more women than ever are entering menopause and suffering the effects , often in silence because of embarrassment or a lack of information			1
. 62 - year - old @entity36 suffered from @entity1 in silence for years and said it almost destroyed her marriage one of the most common and debilitating side effects of menopause is @entity1 ( @entity7 ) - also known as vaginal dryness			1
a survey commissioned by the @entity44 has revealed that 45 % of women who have reached the menopause have suffered from @entity7 and 70 % of those women say that their sex life has suffered drastically as a result			1
@entity7 can have disastrous consequences for sex lives , relationships and marriages as well as the physical and mental health of women and although treatment is easy diagnosis remains tricky because it is such a taboo subject for many doctors and their patients			1
today on this morning 62 - year - old @entity36 appeared on the sofa with the show 's resident doctor dr. @entity62 to talk about the impact @entity7 had on her life , and try and help raise awareness			1
she said : ' it started in my 40s when using tampons became painful			0
' gradually sex was very painful , it was like a carpet burn			1
' i was always too embarrassed to talk to my husband and he started to say it was like sleeping with a stranger			0
he felt very isolated and we started rowing about it			0
' i was too embarrassed to go to the doctor too			0
' i did my own research and found out that what i was feeling had a name , it was @entity1 , i thought " that is me " ! ' it is life changing , going from being a jibbering idiot thinking there is something very wrong with me to finding out that this is just a symptom of the menopause			1
' and the remedy is so very simple			2
' my husband used to say " i just want my wife back , " i used to say " i just want my life back ! "			2
' the graphic by @entity99 shows how @entity1 affects both men and women , it was created as a result of a survey of 4000 women of menopausal age what is @entity1 before the menopause the skin and tissues around the vagina are kept supple and moist by fluids and mucus			1
these are made by glands at the neck of the womb			0
@entity117 ( the female hormone ) affects these glands			0
@entity117 also affects the tissues in and around the vagina , causing the lining of the vagina to be thicker and more elastic			0
@entity117 also stimulates the cells that line the vagina to produce glycogen , a compound which encourages the presence of helpful bacteria which protect the vagina from @entity128 the menopause the ovaries make less oestrogen			1
the lack of oestrogen leads to thinning of the tissues around the vagina and a reduction in the number of glands that make mucus			2
you also lose some fat tissue from around the genital area			0
this may make the area also look slightly different than before the @entity145 summary , the hormonal changes make the vagina shorter , less elastic and drier			0
the genital skin also looks paler			0
these changes usually take months or years to develop after the menopause and vary from woman to woman			2
atrophic vaginitis is the medical term for the condition when these changes produce troublesome symptoms			0

treatment may depend on which symptoms are the most troublesome			2
because the problem is mainly due to a lack of oestrogen , it can be helped by replacing the oestrogen in the tissues			2
hormone replacement therapy ( @entity12 ) this means taking oestrogen in the form of a tablet , gel , implant or patches			1
this may be the best treatment for relieving the symptoms , but some women do n't like the idea of taking @entity12			1
there are advantages and disadvantages of using @entity12			1
see separate leaflet called ' menopause and @entity12 ' for more detail			1
oestrogen creamssometimes a cream , pessary or vaginal ring containing oestrogen is prescribed			1
this restores oestrogen to the vagina and surrounding tissues without giving oestrogen to the whole body			2
usually the treatment is used every day for about two weeks , and then twice a week for a further three months			0
after this the effect of the treatment may be assessed by your doctor			0
this treatment usually works well but the symptoms may recur some time after stopping the treatment			0
repeated courses of treatment are often necessary			0
it is important to follow the instructions about the amount of cream to use			0
lubricating gelsif vaginal dryness is the only problem , or hormone creams are not recommended because of other medical problems , lubricating gels may help			1
there are two gels which are available in the @entity224 that are specifically designed to help the problem of vaginal dryness			1
they are @entity230 and @entity231			0
you can buy these from the pharmacy and your pharmacist should be able to advise you .			0
