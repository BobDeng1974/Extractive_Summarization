@entity0 complained to police after accusing builders of sexual harassment for wolf - whistling when @entity0 was wolf - whistled at by builders on her walk to work , she at first tried to ignore it			1
but as the whistles and accompanying sexist comments turned into a daily ritual , the 23 - year - old began to get upset			2
finally , after a month of unwanted attention from the men on the building site , the marketing co-ordinator decided she 'd had enough â€“ and called the police			0
miss @entity0 , who recorded the constant whistling using her smartphone 's video function , also contacted one of the construction companies working at the site to complain of sexual harassment			1
she compared the wolf - whistling to racial discrimination and said it made her walk to work in @entity27 an ' awful experience '			1
one of the workers even approached her on the pavement , blocking her way , before saying ' morning love ' after she had ignored a cacophony of whistling , miss @entity0 said			2
' he was probably 18 or 19 and got right in my face , standing next to an older man			0
he did n't touch me but they were in my personal space in the pavement , in my way , even though i literally blanked him			0
i 'm quite a nervous person and this has made my anxiety worse			0
' the whistling went on for a month			0
i eventually contacted the building company and the police on the same day when it got so bad			0
i even considered changing my route to work but thought , ' why should i do that ? ' @entity51 police confirmed they had followed up miss @entity0 's complaint as a possible incident of anti-social behaviour but had not taken further action			1
a spokesman said : ' after consultation with the woman who reported the behaviour it was decided that the employers would deal with those said to be responsible			0
' although wolf - whistling is not a specific offence , workmen who repeatedly make obscene comments to passers - by could be convicted of a breach of the peace			1
miss @entity0 , from @entity70 , was first whistled at in the middle of february when she started a new job			0
ms @entity0 recorded one of the occasions she walked past the building site			1
there is no suggestion any of the men pictured in the mobile phone footage ( shown left and right ) were involved in the alleged wolf - whistling the builders concerned were working on the expansion of the @entity85 restaurant			1
miss @entity0 said she had not seen the men responsible since she complained to the building company , @entity87			2
the firm 's boss was ' shocked and annoyed ' at his staff 's behaviour and asked her to contact him if there was a repeat , she said			2
@entity94 and @entity95 , of @entity96 , @entity97 , said the matter was being dealt with by the firm 's solicitors but refused to comment further			0
miss @entity0 said she had been targeted on other occasions in @entity70 , not just near the building site			2
the building yard in @entity70 where ms @entity0 alleges workman wolf - whistled at her while on her way to work ' disrespectful ' : the 23 - year - old marketing co-ordinator ( pictured ) claimed builders at a construction site wolf - whistled at her every morning as she walked to work in @entity27 ' men will lean out of their cars or vans and shout comments about my appearance or whistle and i have seen this happen to others as well			1
i do n't think such comments , even if they are considered complimentary by the perpetrators , are appropriate			0
it makes walking through town an awful experience			0
' in 2012 , @entity124 insisted wolf - whistling would not be made illegal in @entity126 despite signing the @entity126 up to the @entity128 's convention on violence against women , which pledges to outlaw ' verbal , non-verbal or physical ' sexual harassment			1
at the time , mr @entity124 's official spokesman said : ' we have harassment laws in this country			0
we are not proposing to criminalise wolf - whistling			1
' @entity137 , of the @entity138 , said wolf - whistling represented ' everyday sexism ' which should be stamped out			1
' sexual harassment in the street is too often regarded as trivial when the reality is that many women feel humiliated , insulted and sometimes intimidated by it , ' she said			2
' men who respect women do not do it			0
' wolf - whistles , which originated among sailors , have now been banned by a number of building firms			2
ms @entity0 ( left ) said she was regularly wolf - whistled at while walking past a building site ( right ) on her way to work			1
