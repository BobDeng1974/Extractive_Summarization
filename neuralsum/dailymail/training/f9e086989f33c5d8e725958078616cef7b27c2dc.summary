a craze for compliments is sweeping @entity2 after high school and university students set up pages where users could give friends at the same school a boost anonymously			1
the sudden outbreak of ' cyber-graciousness ' amongst youngsters in the @entity14 and @entity15 has been hailed as a refreshing change from the bullying and trolling the internet has become notorious for			1
according to reports , four students at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity15 , were the first to set up such a page for their institution several months ago			1
reverse trolling : the @entity27 page , set up in september , has sparked a craze across @entity14 for @entity2 pages where school students can give their peers an anonymous boost the idea quickly took hold among youngsters elsewhere and there are now nearly 100 such groups on @entity2 , most based in @entity15 and the @entity14 the @entity38 , set up september 12 , invited students to ' inbox a compliment for a @entity43 's student and have it published anonymously '			1
since then thousands of compliments have been posted on the page , which already boasts nearly 5,000 friends			1
the pages work by accepting compliments sent directly to an inbox , which administrators then re-post the person for whom the compliment is intended tagged so it shows up in their @entity2 notifications			1
very nice : one post as it appears on the @entity27 compliments page the compliments are reposted anonymously by the page 's administrators , so their recipients have no idea who their flatterer is			1
one such compliment recently posted on the @entity27 page reads : ' @entity65 is simply wonderful			1
' another says : ' @entity70 this man is the hardest working individual i know , he deserves some respect for always putting others before him			2
never give up and keep being a bouss [ sic ]			2
' a third gushes : ' @entity75 is such a gem			2
she 's always there as a shoulder to cry on and she never fails to make you feel ten times better			0
plus she always looks so cool ! love you girl			0
' @entity83 , an instructor in the @entity84 at @entity85 , where students set up a similar page , told the @entity88 they could have ' a contagious effect in a positive sense '			1
' there is so much negativity today , whether you see it on tv or in movies or even in just personal relationships			0
this is like a breath of fresh air , ' mr @entity83 said			0
' i like the idea of having something other than cyber-bullying			1
' ' cyber-graciousness ' : the @entity108 page for @entity110 's @entity109			2
@entity83 , an instructor at @entity85 , where students set up a similar page , said it was a ' breath of fresh air ' as @entity14 students use @entity2 to launch spontaneous campaigns of anonymous goodwill , students on the other side of the @entity117 are set to sue the social network claiming it has not done enough to protect the privacy of its members			1
@entity126 campaign group europe - v - facebook , a @entity128 - wide student group which has been lobbying for better data protection by @entity2 for over a year , said it planned to take legal action in @entity131 , where @entity2 has its international headquarters			1
the move is one of a number of campaigns against the giants of the internet , which are under pressure from investors to generate more revenue from their huge user bases but which also face criticism for storing and sharing personal information			0
internet search engine @entity146 , for example , has been told by the @entity148 to make changes to its new privacy policy , which pools data collected on individual users across its services including @entity155 , gmail and social network @entity157 , and from which users can not opt out			0
@entity128 - v - facebook has won some concessions from @entity2 , notably pushing it to switch off its facial recognition feature in @entity128			1
but the group said last week the changes did not go far enough and it was disappointed with the response of the @entity131 data protection commissioner , which had carried out an audit after the campaign group filed numerous complaints			0
another youngster to take up the idea of setting up a compliments page for his school was @entity173 , a pupil at @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity176 , a state - funded school with 2,000 students			1
after seeing similar pages complimenting friends across the country coming up in his news feed , he anonymously created the account one evening			0
within 24 hours his page had attracted more than 300 compliments			2
' i was really worried that people would take advantage of the system and write horrible things about their classmates and peers , ' @entity173 told @entity194			0
but , he added , of the roughly 1,500 comments submitted over the four days he ran the page , just four or five were derogatory , with only one using a profanity			2
indeed , in what could be soon as a total reverse of the usual online trend to ever more unpleasant insults , the complimenting soon became competitive			0
' someone would post a compliment , and someone else would post an even longer , even more supportive and even funnier compliment , ' @entity173 said			0
eventually he closed the @entity208 , before writing a column for his school 's student paper in which he identified himself as the forum 's creator			0
peers responded to his efforts by giving him a standing ovation as he walked into class soon after			0
despite his pleasure at the outbreak of goodwill that his page caused , @entity173 felt compelled to shut down his popular page because of the time he spent on it meant he was unable to complete schoolwork			2
' i do not have enough hours in my day to copy and paste so many compliments , ' he said .			0

students at @entity20 in @entity21 were the first to set up such a page in september
since then the idea has been taken up at schools across the @entity14 and @entity15 with nearly 100 now listed on @entity2
