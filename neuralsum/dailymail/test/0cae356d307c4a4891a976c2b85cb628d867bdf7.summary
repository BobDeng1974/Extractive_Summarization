a @entity1 hospital claims it has performed the ' world 's most complex ' face transplant , allowing a man terribly disfigured by a disease to lead a normal life			1
doctors said the 27 - hour procedure – to reconstruct the man 's entire lower face and neck – is the most difficult surgery they have carried out to date			1
a spokesperson for the @entity15 hospital in @entity16 , where the surgery was performed , said a team of 45 doctors , surgeons , nurses and anaesthesiologists took part in the operation in february			1
the x-rays show the man before and after the surgery other specialists from the hospital 's plastic surgery and liver transplant departments were also brought in to advise on the procedure , details of which have only just been released			2
the patient , a 45 - year - old man , did not want to be identified			2
unlike similar operations , where a patient has had features of their face replaced , or rebuilt , the latest procedure was much more invasive			2
the man had suffered a condition called arteriovenous malformation for the past 20 years			0
this is a tangle of blood vessels in the brain which diverts blood from the arteries to the veins , bypassing normal brain tissue			0
in this man 's case , it caused facial deformities and problems with his vision and speech			1
as a result , most of the man 's face lower face was been reconstructed , including his neck , mouth , tongue and the back of his throat			1
and all the skin and muscles of his face , nose , lips , jaw , all teeth , palate and cheek bones were transplanted by using plastic surgery techniques and microsurgery			0
there was , however , a risk of severe bleeding that put his life in danger			2
the man had been examined in several other hospitals , including the @entity94 and @entity95 , which had considered him to be inoperable			0
doctors at the @entity15 hospital in @entity16 , who carried out the procedure , say it was the world 's most complex to date			1
the operation took a team of 45 medical staff 27 hours to complete but the @entity15 hospital ruled surgery was his only treatment option - and this week reveled the good news that the man is now living a normal life			1
the hospital released a statement saying : ' this is the first time that a transplant of this complexity has been performed in the world			0
' ' the patient evolution after the surgery was successful , similar to any transplant patient at the hospital			0
' now he is already at home and only comes to the hospital for routine check - ups			0
' in 2010 the same hospital carried out the world 's first full face transplant on a man who suffered an accident leaving him without a nose and with a deformed jaw and cheekbones			1
the first ever partial facial transplant was carried out by doctors in @entity136 in 2005 , on a woman who had been mauled by her dog .			0
