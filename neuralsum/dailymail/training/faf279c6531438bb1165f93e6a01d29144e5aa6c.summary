by @entity0 it is a bizarre mix of kitesurfing and sailing - and could be the next big extreme sport			2
two @entity6 sailors invented the sport after deciding to try and fly their boat using a kite			1
now the @entity10 has gone on sale , and the pair believe it could be the next big thing in watersports			0
the new sport involves using a kite to ' tow ' a boat through the water length : 4.00 m ( 13 ft ) width : 1.20 m ( 3.94 ft ) weight : 75 kg ( 165 lb ) material : @entity23 : @entity24 from 7 sqm – 17 sqm ( 75 sq.ft - 183 sq.ft ) crew : 1 or 2 @entity26 and designer @entity27 have spent four years developing the boat			1
' years of testing with normal open sailing dinghy ’s and prototype resulted in the @entity33 concept , ' they said			0
the unique design was especially created for ' kitesailing ' after @entity26 saw a kitesurfer in the @entity36 who was having problems with his knees			0
the kitesurfer jumped onboard a small fishing boat before launching his kite and sailing the boat to shore			1
' that image was stored in my brains for some 15 years , ' @entity26 told @entity47			0
' as i used to be a sailor , i hated to be located at just one spot or spending a lot of time doing maintenance and rigging			0
' so without spending hours to fit the mast you can just find a good spot to inflate your @entity57 , attach it to the @entity58 , launch it and away you go			1
' its inventors say the sport blends traditional sailing and kiteboarding the pair spent four years developing the prototype for their boat , which is now on sale there are several variation of the kite depending on how fast the sailor wants to go			1
' you can choose a rather relaxed start with a small kite or choose the extreme with a bigger @entity78 in big winds - although for the extreme you ’d better be quite experienced , ' the firm says			2
' @entity80 is more like sailing , you steer your kitetender with a rudder and you do have a centreboard , and you steer your kite			2
within @entity86 the @entity10 is currently priced at € 5,299 ( us $ 7,090 ) and the @entity87 will cost € 19,999 ( us $ 26,750 ) .			0
