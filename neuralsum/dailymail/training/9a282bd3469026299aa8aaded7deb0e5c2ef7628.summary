we all know @entity1 is one of the best defenders we have seen in the @entity3 but , after watching him against @entity4 last week , he needs to make adjustments if he wants to continue his rise to greatness			1
when you watch @entity9 on tv , he looks awesome and some people might think it is churlish to criticise him			2
he is strong , fast and agile			2
he is always quick to the ball and excellent at pinching it off strikers ’ toes			2
he used to be rash and would dive in , which led to some red cards , but to his credit he has cut that out of his game			1
watching at the @entity23 , though , i could spot an obvious problem			0
whenever he comes charging out of the back line , he is taking a big risk for the team			1
the rewards are obvious and when it comes off he looks magnificent			0
but when it goes wrong , he can be left stranded			0
@entity1 is a class act but he is also a gambler who comes charging out of the back line it ’s what happened in the first half against @entity4 when some of their early movement caused @entity43 problems			1
more than once @entity1 came rushing out to try to be first to the ball , only for an opposition player to nick in ahead of him			1
that left holes at the back and @entity4 were able to exploit that			0
he reads the first pass into the striker so well but it ’s the second phase that becomes difficult			0
@entity1 is one of the fastest defenders around but once he is out of position it ’s almost impossible to recover			1
@entity55 is the worst example of a defender too keen to press forward			1
at the @entity59 it was like pulling the plug out of the bath — opposition sides would just flood into the holes behind him			0
you ca n’t win games at the back but you can lose them			0
@entity43 defender @entity1 was guilty of taking risks against @entity4 @entity1 is far superior to @entity55 but sometimes he would be better off staying put in the back line and waiting for the game to come to him			1
the players in front of him can go out and attack			0
this is not to say @entity1 is a bad defender , far from it			1
he is such a powerful player he could play anywhere on the pitch			0
that makes it tempting to try to do all those jobs , but sometimes he is fighting too many fires			0
he ends up covering for his team - mates and tries to do too much			2
i do sympathise , though , because when you think of great defenders , you think of partnerships or back fours			0
with @entity43 , you just think of @entity1			1
@entity89 's @entity88 defender @entity55 ( left ) is the worst example of a defender too keen to press forward @entity88 defender @entity55 walks off the pitch after losing @entity59 semi-final against @entity94 in 10 years at @entity95 i had three major partners : @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
in seven seasons at @entity43 , @entity1 has played with @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and now @entity109			1
that makes it almost impossible to build consistency as a unit			0
@entity1 is so articulate and already speaks like a future manager so it ’s no surprise that he plays in such an emphatic way			2
he is a fantastic ambassador and part of an excellent core at the club			0
for all their lavish spending , @entity43 are balancing that with a feeling of respect and there is genuine warmth around the club			2
but , if they ’re not careful , the league title may suddenly start to slip from their grasp			0
@entity1 is so often the man who tries to make sure that does n’t happen , but he needs to ensure those rewards are gained by taking slightly fewer risks .			1

@entity1 is a gambler and he is taking a big risk for the team
the @entity43 defender can be rash and dive in
@entity55 is worst example of a defender too keen to press forward
