by @entity1 reporter the man suing x-men director @entity3 for raping him as a teen claimed he had never actually been to @entity5 - where many of his explosive allegations took place - in a separate 2003 lawsuit that was unearthed today			1
@entity8 , now - 31 , stated under oath that he had never left the continental @entity10 in part of a deposition , obtained by @entity13 , that was taken for a previous lawsuit after the rapes allegedly took place			1
the news casts doubt over his horrific claims last month that @entity3 and others drugged and raped him during a series of sordid pool parties in @entity23 , @entity24 , but mainly in a seven - bedroom estate in @entity26 , outside @entity27 , @entity5 , in 1999			1
conflicting information : @entity8 , pictured april 21 , 2014 , stated under oath that he had never left the continental @entity10 in a deposition , unearthed by @entity13 , that was taken for a previous lawsuit after the rapes allegedly happened in the 11 - year - old deposition , @entity8 directly contradicts much of his own case through his sworn statement that he 'd never at that point left the mainland @entity10 with the defendants			1
@entity13 obtained six pages of the 84 - page deposition			0
in those pages , @entity8 responds to a question about his travel , saying he 'd ' never had any trips outside the continental @entity10 , no. ' he then specially refers to @entity5 , clarifying that another person did go to the state			1
' i 'm not sure how he interpreted the continental @entity10 , ' @entity8 's lawyer , @entity47 , told @entity13 of the remarks in the deposition			1
' i 'm not sure what he 's talking about specifically here			0
' alleged rapist : the news casts doubt over his horrific claims last month that @entity3 , pictured , and others drugged and raped him during a series of sordid pool parties in @entity23 , @entity24 , but mainly in a seven - bedroom estate in @entity26 , outside @entity27 , @entity5 , in 1999 @entity47 said @entity8 's mother , @entity61 , confirmed the trips to him , telling him she 'd authorized either @entity63 or @entity64 to take her young son to @entity5 at least twice			1
and @entity8 also confirmed them , @entity47 said			0
however , in the deposition , @entity8 explained that he 'd never traveled outside the continental @entity10 because his mother would not let him			1
@entity63 or @entity64 plus another man , @entity69 , were being sued in the previous lawsuit by not just @entity8 but four other co-plaintiffs			2
the case , which played out in @entity74 court , targeted the internet entrepreneurs , who were allegedly the ringleaders in the abuse of young , aspiring male actors			0
in the deposition , @entity8 was asked if he ever took any trips with the defendants , to which he responds that he did , to places like @entity84 and @entity85			2
but he said he did n't not travel outside the continental @entity10 though someone , likely another victim who 's name is redacted from the deposition , did			2
asked where , he responds ' from what i recollect , i believe he went to @entity5			0
' when he 's asked why the other boy went and he did n't , he said his mom would never allow him to anywhere within any far amount of distance , like @entity96 , any of those ' and would ' pretty much lock the door ' when he asked			0
last month 's lawsuit also claims @entity3 ' forcibly sodomized @entity8 ' in the @entity23 mansion , an allegation not undermined by the newly publicized deposition			1
however , the @entity5 allegations are vital to the latest case as @entity8 was able to file suit in the state because of an extended statute of limitations for older cases such as his			2
he filed april 16 , 2014 , just days before the april 24 cut off			0
scene of the crime ? @entity8 was allegedly taken on two trips to @entity5 with @entity3 where they stayed at the @entity116 resort , entrance pictured above			1
however , those claims are now in question meanwhile , another alleged victim , an unnamed @entity121 teenager , filed a lawsuit early this month alleging that the @entity124 heavyweight sexually assaulted him			2
now aged 25 , the man accuses @entity3 of sexually abusing him when he was 17 at a @entity127 hotel along with @entity129 producer @entity128			0
this second blow came after the @entity132 director called the rape accusations made against him ' a sick twisted shake down ' and announced he would be missing press appearances for his upcoming movie in light of the allegations			0
@entity3 's attorney did not comment to @entity13 in regard to the latest news .			0

@entity8 stated under oath that he 'd never left the continental @entity10 in a 2003 deposition for a previous lawsuit after the rapes allegedly happened
the news casts doubt over his horrific claims last month that @entity3 and others drugged and raped him during a series of sordid pool parties
the parties allegedly occurred in @entity23 , @entity24 , but mainly in a seven - bedroom estate in @entity26 , outside @entity27 , @entity5 , in 1999
in the 11 - year - old deposition , @entity8 seems to directly contradicts much of his own case through his sworn statement
