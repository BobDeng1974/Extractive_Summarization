the crisis at beleaguered @entity2 side @entity1 has intensified with fresh accusations being made in the civil war between the club 's chairman and president			1
@entity1 's chairman @entity8 has released an open letter hitting back at club president @entity10 , a @entity11 businessman who has a 20 per cent stake in the side			1
it comes with fans fearful of the future with only 11 registered players - but no goalkeeper - ahead of their first league match of the season at @entity21 on august 9			1
@entity22 last week accused the @entity8 family of putting financial gain ahead of the club and of having ' channeled away more than £ 24 million '			2
chairman : @entity8 refuted claims that he had contributed to @entity1 's demise this summer now @entity8 has hit back , saying in a letter published on the club website that it is the @entity11 who is demanding £ 24million from the club and defending his family 's running of @entity1			1
@entity8 's letter says @entity22 asked for £ 24million to buy out his 20 per cent shareholding a year ago and asked for that again last week			1
the letter states : ' this , @entity10 , if had we agreed to pay £ 24million , would have given you a massive profit of virtually three times the original combined cost of your shares , which cost you £ 1.8million , with a further £ 6.6 million loan from you to contribute towards the construction and fit - out of the @entity46 and @entity47 stands			0
' you have already taken £ 1.86million from the football club			0
' threat : manager @entity50 has threatened to quit @entity1 in protest of player sales @entity22 accused the @entity53 of moving more than £ 24million to other family companies in the form of interest - free loans without his approval , and of taking more than £ 11.5million out of the club in salaries			2
@entity8 says his father @entity60 and the family ' have funded the club since the day he got involved 27 years ago ' and that his father ' has never taken a penny in dividends or any salary or any consultancy fees '			1
@entity8 said the £ 24million ' was in part used to pay off loans to @entity70 , @entity71 , which was a considerable benefit to @entity1 because they were loans that had been used to build and modernise the @entity1 stadium and to provide @entity1 with income streams			2
please note that @entity70 and @entity76 , both @entity78 group companies , did not take profit or interest on those loans			0
protest : @entity1 fans express their anger at @entity8 's running of the @entity2 side ' you say that my father and i took £ 11.5million in salaries			2
the board approved the payment of £ 11million to @entity71 , a company owned by my father			0
' the money did not go to him personally and it was paid in consideration to @entity76 for its financial help and the help of other group companies for having supported the football club over a period of 24 years and building much of the stadium you see today			0
this involved large interest - free loans , without which support @entity1 would not have survived			0
' @entity8 adds that the family are ' in this for the long termi and expresses surprise that @entity109 has been backed by the @entity110 and the @entity112 @entity111 .			0

@entity1 only have 11 registered players and no goalkeeper
@entity1 president @entity10 *blamed* the club 's *problems* on the chairman
chairman @entity8 wrote an open letter refuting @entity22 's claims
