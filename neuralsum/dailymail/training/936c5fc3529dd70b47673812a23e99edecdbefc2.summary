@entity10 with hr band , @entity15 and the @entity16 at the @entity57 @entity56 ‘ i think there ’s a myth that if you are a woman in your fifties and you ’re not @entity21 or if you ’re not wearing stiletto heels and a corset that you are kind of settled in to middle age			1
‘ but i want to be the one to stay that just is n’t the case , i feel your sexuality and the expression of that is at its peak for a woman in her 50s			2
‘ i ’m really happy to be embracing that in my look and my music – not in a ‘ hey i ’m 20 ’ kind of way but in loving being my age			1
‘ just because you ’re 50 it does n’t mean it ’s not happening for you any more , you have every right to express your sexuality			2

’ getting down ( ton ) : @entity10 performs as @entity15 and the @entity16 at the @entity88 however the @entity90 - born star , who started singing with @entity15 and the @entity16 in 2008 , told how as was sometimes made ‘ uncomfortable ’ by singers like @entity92 when she thought of her daughters @entity94 , 20 , and @entity95 , 16			1

the performer , who opened for @entity104 at the @entity105 in july , added : ‘ i do n’t mind explicit sexuality in young women if it is married to something with some kind of depth , or meaning of some kind			1
‘ but sadly so much of music is enthralled with lyrics and image which is so sexually vacuous , it ’s just without any depth what so ever and that ’s what makes me so uncomfortable			2
what would @entity121 say ? @entity10 looked a far cry from her @entity9 character grooving : the actress and singer threw some shapes on the @entity129 stage ‘ i think being provocative in an empty way is actually rather boring			0
‘ i do n’t think it ’s had a terrible effect on my kids , but i hope they see it like i do in that there is no meat there			0
it is a meal with no nutrition , it ’s just something to look at rather than there being any real muse or idea behind it			0
‘ i actually if i look for inspiration i look to someone like @entity102			0
she is very authentic and classy			0
she has managed to inject her brain into her music and her ideas and i think she is a wonderful example for women , especially for young women , for them to see another woman building it from scratch and being successful			1
