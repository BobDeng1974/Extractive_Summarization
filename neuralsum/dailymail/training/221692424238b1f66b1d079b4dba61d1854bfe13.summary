by @entity0 imagine the full stop at the end of this sentence was a camera			1
it might sound unbelievable , but that ’s exactly what @entity8 technology company @entity7 have built - an incredibly tiny device no bigger than the tip of a pencil			1
in reality though , it ’s not really a camera but rather a tiny chip embedded in a piece of glass that converts the light it receives into an algorithm to create pictures			1
the researchers behind the project , @entity25 and @entity26 , say their lensless invention could hypothetically allow almost any device to contain a camera			1
now you see it : the lensless camera ( left ) is tiny compared to a traditional smartphone camera ( middle ) and pales in comparison to the size of a coin it works by using a tiny chip known as a cmos ( complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ) embedded in a paper - thin piece of glass			1
as light hits the glass , the imager processes the light into an algorithm			2
etched patterns on the glass then refract the light in different ways as it passes through			0
at this point the image is unrecognisable but , ultimately , the algorithms reconstruct the light into a recognisable image that mimics the real object			0
at the moment the images are relatively blurry at a resolution of just 128x128 , but as the technology is advanced it ’s likely its capability will get better and better			2
the technology is still in its infancy , but this prototype shows just what could be achieved by this sort of technology in future			0
without requiring a lens , future gadgets like smartphones could be made smaller and smaller while still possessing picture - taking abilities			2
further down the line it ’s possible the technology could be embedded into everyday items like clothes , mirrors and toys to give us entirely new methods of interactivity			0
this lensless camera works by using a tiny chip known as a cmos ( complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ) embedded in a paper - thin piece of glass			1
as light hits the glass , the imager processes the light into an algorithm			2
a traditional camera ( top ) relies on a multitude of equipment to take a picture , but the lensless camera ( bottom ) can create the same image with a paper - thin chip etched patterns on the glass then refract the light in different ways as it passes through			1
at this point the image is unrecognisable but , ultimately , the algorithms reconstruct the light into a recognisable image that mimics the real object			0
at the moment the images are relatively blurry at a resolution of just 128x128 , but as the technology is advanced it ’s likely its capability will get better and better			0
‘ these sensors are so small they should find use in endoscopy , medical sensing , machine inspection [ and ] surveillance , ’ @entity124 and @entity125 write in their research paper on the device			0
they go on to add that the device is ‘ so inexpensive ’ that it should find use in ‘ a number of single - use scenarios , for instance in surgery and warfare			0
imagine : here , @entity140 's face has been recreated by the lensless camera by processing the light from a picture of the famous @entity145 star similarly the @entity146 has been processed by the camera here			1
although a bit blurrier than the original for now , the technology is still in its infancy and highlights the possibilities of such a device			0

a lensless camera smaller than a full stop could *revolutionise* *photography*
developed by @entity7 , the tiny chip - *based* device processes light using an algorithm to create images
the technology has already been proven by recreating famous pictures such as the @entity146
there are a host of future uses *including* rapid *airbag* *deployment* and interactive toys for *children*
