all five of my senses are being bombarded , from the overpowering stench of a fellow commuter ’s breath barely inches away ( chicken balti was on the menu last night , i deduce ) to the @entity10 announcements , played on a torturous endless loop , urging us repeatedly to ‘ report unattended packages ’ and ‘ mind the gap ’			2
even the lighting is a visual assault			2
suddenly there ’s a sharp jab in my ribs : ‘ @entity20 , mate , ’ a man beside me says			2
‘ you ’re invading my personal space			2
’ personal space ? if only there was such a luxury			2
i feel i am on more intimate terms with this man than i am with my own wife			2
i can smell we share the same brand of shaving gel			2
his hair , still shower damp , is brushing against my cheek with every jolt and lurch of the carriage			2
last month this @entity50 service was named in a list of shame of the @entity54 overcrowded train services in @entity44			1
according to the official @entity57 figures , it ’s overloaded by 154 per cent , meaning every morning there are 1,278 passengers playing a daily grim game of musical chairs for the 738 seats available			2
all this seems a terrible shame , since rail travel at its best can be one of the divine pleasures of life			2
as an author who spends much of his life writing about railways , no one loves trains more than me			2
that eminent railway traveller , @entity75 , once wrote : ‘ i have seldom heard a train go by and not wished i was on it			1
’ would he want to be on the 07.32 from @entity45 ? i doubt it			1
the truth is that too much modern train travel has become like this , where we travel trapped in overpriced , garish , harshly lit , cacophonous , beeping plastic trains and squashed by a miserable mass of humanity			1
fellow passenger @entity87 , 27 , from @entity45 , on her way to her job as a @entity90 is trying to stay cool , and ‘ zoned out ’ with her @entity92 earphones in her ears			1
‘ i rarely get a seat , ’ she says			0
‘ and for that i have to pay £ 320 a month for my ticket			0
’ our carriage sways and lurches — not helped by the fact the line is basically unchanged since @entity101 times , with an antiquated ‘ third rail ’ power system — the train is powered by an electric track underneath as opposed to the more modern and efficient overhead electricity cables			1
the @entity50 service was named at the top of a list of shame recently , but bosses claim the antiquated railways are full , and that the company could n't run more trains , even if it had them they were introduced in the @entity115 by the old @entity116 and are now considered obsolete , yet no one has had the courage or resources to rip them out and start again			0
@entity123 , 26 , from @entity124 , on her way to a property management course , says : ‘ what i hate is the crush and people with bad breath in your face			0
' it ’s so packed i once had someone fall asleep on my shoulder standing up			0
and people are often unkind to elderly people and young children in the crush			0
’ pinstriped @entity136 , 45 , on his way to his job in the @entity139 , is squashed in the corridor outside the @entity142 section , which is two - thirds empty , but — at around £ 5,000 for a season ticket , compared to £ 3,500 in standard class — prohibitively expensive			0
he says there are just too many excuses on the line			0
‘ they need to get their act together , ’ he adds			0
‘ last week , they cancelled this train			1
can you imagine what hell it was on the one that followed ? ’ hundreds of thousands across the @entity44 suffer dire conditions like this on their daily scramble to work			1
a miserable one in five of the 545,000 passengers travelling into @entity46 on any morning has to stand , with trains serving @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 the worst			1
the chief of @entity46 ’s biggest rail franchise , the @entity168 , risked the wrath of passengers last week by saying he intended to tackle the problem of overcrowding by ‘ making it easier to stand ’			1
a euphemism for : ‘ it ’s getting worse , so take it or leave it			0
’ in the @entity177 , where many passengers have to stand for more than 20 minutes around @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , the trains are often even worse — with elderly carriages made of bus parts , running on four , harsh - riding wheels in the style of the vehicles pulled by @entity188			1
commuting was n’t always as bad as this			0
until the @entity191 many commuter trains around the south of @entity193 had a buffet car , where you might treat yourself to a noggin or two to ease the pain on the way back from the office — and join your mates in the card schools which were features of such trains			0
@entity46 is at capacity at both morning and evening peak , but infrastructure to alleviate this will cost billions , and @entity208 funding is unlikely any time soon @entity210 line commuters could relax in armchairs in @entity213 luxury on the @entity214 , breakfasting on freshly grilled kippers with a cheering @entity216			1
meanwhile , edwardian era commuters on the @entity218 into @entity219 could reserve seats in a @entity222 car , where waiters in crisp uniforms would serve a full @entity193 breakfast amid the elegant mahogany marquetry , green damask blinds and thick carpets			1
no chance of this today , where not a single train south of the @entity232 any longer has a buffet car , and on my 07.32 , even if one of the elusive snack trolleys could be squeezed aboard , it would be crushed out of shape			1
as if to confirm this , @entity239 the guard announces as we reach @entity242 : ‘ due to sheer numbers of people on board , i can no longer walk down the train			1
’ no wonder , by the time we get to @entity46 , @entity44 ’s busiest station , i ’m limp and dizzy			1
in a mere 47 - minute journey , i ’ve morphed into ‘ mr @entity249 of @entity45 ’ and i ’m looking for someone to blame			1
in the old days i might have marched up to the stationmaster ’s office and had a stiff word			0
but in the fragmented and @entity256 world of @entity44 ’s railway system today , no one takes full responsibility any more			1
ministers blame the train companies and the train firms blame @entity57 bureaucrats			1
in this bizarre @entity266 structure , although the railways are privatised , no new trains can be built without the say - so of the government			0
it ’s a miserable fact that since privatisation 20 years ago , only around 6,000 new carriages have been built , and more than half our trains date from the old days of @entity273			0
to keep up , industry experts say we should increase this number eightfold , but the main problem is the ancient infrastructure built on the @entity45 line by the @entity46 and @entity279 in 1840			1
‘ our railway is full , and even if we had more trains we could n’t run them , ’ @entity281 , boss of @entity50 , tells me			0
‘ @entity46 is at capacity in the morning and evening peak			1
’ state - of - the - art infrastructure would cost a fortune — and the @entity208 is unlikely to stump up any time soon			0
ministers boast about @entity46 ’s new £ 14.8 billion @entity291 commuter line , due to open in 2018			1
yet the track record on improvements for @entity46 commuters is poor			1
the new @entity168 commuter line is expected to finally open in four years ’ time — 18 years behind schedule at a cost of £ 6 billion			0
at the same time , ever more people are using the railways — with 1.6 billion annual passenger journeys , the highest ever , and rising			0
but this is n’t because we ’re all hooked on the joy of the train			1
many are motorists put off by road congestion , or young people who can no longer afford a car			0
rail travel used to be more pleasant			0
travellers on the the @entity214 could breakfast on kippers and @entity216 on the way to work ( pictured , @entity314 and @entity315 on board ) but most are the poor bloody commuters — driven into the outer suburbs by sky - high @entity46 property prices			1
the number of commuters travelling into the capital has risen by a third in the past four years alone			2
which means that @entity87 , @entity123 and @entity136 on the @entity45 line — and others like them — are condemned to the hell of their daily commute , trapped in a ratchet of ever - higher season ticket costs			1
season tickets will rise by 2.5 per cent in the @entity335 , hiking yet again the most expensive fares in @entity337			2
ministers pledge the rise will fund future rail improvements			0
scant comfort for many of us who will never see it in our lifetimes			0
@entity346 , 30 , from @entity347 , a @entity139 banker , spends £ 2,000 a year on her commute , most of which is spent in the aisle , yet confesses : ‘ this is nothing compared to my home city of @entity355 , where they employ pushers to squash people on to the crammed trains			0
’ please @entity346 , i beg			0
keep that suggestion to yourself			0
@entity41 ’s latest book @entity364 is to be published by @entity365 in spring 2015 .			0

the 07.32 from @entity45 to @entity46 is most crowded train in @entity44
one in five @entity46 commuters has to stand on their journey to work
despite record high fares improvement is unlikely to come *anytime* soon
