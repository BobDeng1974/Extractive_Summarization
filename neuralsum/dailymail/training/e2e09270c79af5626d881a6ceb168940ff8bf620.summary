when snow began falling across northern @entity2 last week four excited sisters rushed to windows of their house to await the first flakes of winter , eager to build a snowman			2
but @entity7 , nine , @entity8 , seven , @entity9 , five and @entity10 , four , were left bitterly disappointed when their village of @entity12 , near @entity13 , remained frost - free			1
however , not to be deterred , father @entity14 , 48 , packed the family into his van and drove more than 40 miles to the @entity17 where several inches of snow had fallen over previous weeks			1
snowy : ( left to right ) @entity10 , four , @entity7 , nine , @entity8 , seven and @entity21 , five , pose with father @entity14 , 48 , with the snowman they made despite their village near @entity13 remaining frost - free hero : mr @entity26 drove his daughters 40 miles to the @entity17 to build @entity28 after no snow fell on @entity30 , just outside @entity13 where the family lives with mother @entity32 , 42 once there the group used stones , planks of wood , sunglasses and a hardhat to build a snowman , who they named @entity28			1
but when the time came to leave the girls could n't bear to be parted with their creation - so dad @entity14 helped them dismantle it , roll it into his van , and transported it back home			2
@entity28 has now taken pride of place at the end of the family driveway , leaving other residents baffled because there is no snow for miles around			1
mother @entity32 , 42 , said : ' they built a snowman and brought the snowman home by dismantling him and rolling him into their dad ’s van			2
@entity67 : the girls constructed @entity28 on sunday using planks of wood , gloves , stones , sunglasses a scarf and hardhat , but when it came time for them to leave him behind they could n't bare to do it far from home : mr @entity26 helped the girls to carefully dismantle the snowman , roll it into the back of his van , and then drove it an hour home before reassembling it at the end of their drive freezing : while there has been no snow in @entity88 , the sub-zero temperatures of recent days have meant the snowman lives on , much to the bemusement of passers - by ' we could not believe the response			1
people have been coming taking photographs			0
people have been going out of their way to see it			0
' mr @entity26 , who helps to run a landscaping business with his wife , had promised his daughters they would go sledging once the snow came			2
but when the wet weather did n't make it to them , he said he would take them to the snow instead , and they drove off in search of some on sunday			0
job well done : mrs @entity10 said that @entity28 has brought joy to the village of @entity88 , with people diverting from miles around to come and see him and take pictures standing out : residents have been left scratching their heads by the snowman which has appeared in the centre of @entity30 despite there being no snow for miles around since bringing him back to his new home on their front lawn , passers - by have been scratching their heads wondering where he came from			1
mrs @entity10 added : ' one woman asked if it was real snow			0
we have just had comments galore			0
it ’s just brought a lot of joy to @entity30			0
' she added : ' there are lots of school children that go past and they just stop and stare			0
