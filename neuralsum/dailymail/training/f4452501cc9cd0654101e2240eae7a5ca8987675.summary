two @entity1 city councilmen have dropped their proposal to rename a beach after @entity4 – marking the second time officials in the president 's home state have balked on honoring him with his name on a stretch of sand and surf			1
it was a series of complaints from the public that drove councilman @entity16 and council chairman @entity17 to withdraw their plan , which would have changed the name of @entity21 to president @entity4 @entity21			1
' we 've heard a number of concerns from members of the community , ' a diplomatic @entity16 told the @entity27			2
' given the facts we received , we do n't think it 's necessary to move forward , ' he said			2
the @entity43 reports that it was a favorite for the president as he grew up			2
cameras caught the future @entity48 occupant riding waves there while he vacationed during his first presidential campaign in 2008			1
in remembrance of that event , the city council approved funding this year for a ' plaque dedicated to president @entity4 's love of bodysurfing at @entity21			1
' but on the issue of renaming the entire site , @entity17 said in a statement that he heard concerns from the community about the historic nature of the beach and cultural sensitivities associated with renaming age - old locations that date back centuries			1
but he added that there may be other public facilities more appropriate to honor the president			2
it 's not clear whether substituting one of them would kill the $ 500,000 in renovation and beautification funding slated to accompany a beach name - change			0
hawaiians were split this week in interviews with @entity80			0
' i do n’t think it ’s fair because , personally , he ’s done nothing for our beach over here , ' @entity82 resident @entity81 told the tv station			0
' maybe he did grow up here , but as a local , i 've been surfing here for 10 years easy and i do n’t think it ’s fair			0
' but @entity92 , another frequent @entity21 visitor , thought the money would help keep the beach spiffy			2
' i think it ’s definitely going to help for sure , ' she said			0
' that way , they ’re going to keep things more picked up probably , more improvements ' so far @entity4 's name has n't been applied to any public buildings , sites or facilities in the state of @entity105			1
current law prohibits renaming such places for anyone who is still alive			1
in 2009 the council debated a bill that would have added a loophole for ' a president of the @entity113 born in @entity105			1
' councilmen and women who wanted to honor other famous @entity78 shot it down , however , complaining that it was too narrow			0
the idea back then was to rename @entity119 , which locals refer to as @entity121			0
the new name would have been president @entity123 at @entity121			0
swamped , but not by @entity124 in @entity125 : @entity4 wo n't see his name on the beach 's main sign , but a plaque already commemorates his love of bodysurfing there @entity132 , who was chairman of the @entity133 in 2009 , told @entity134 then that his constituents would rather have named the park after then - sen. @entity137			1
' i think everyone appreciates the important connection between our current president and our state , ' @entity132 said			0
' but people have raised the point that someone like senator @entity137 has done a huge amount for our state over his extensive term in office , yet there 's no exception for him			0
so where do you draw the line ? ' some politicians on the panel complained that no one who spoke for the @entity159 had been consulted			0
the name @entity161 means ' land of the sea ' in @entity105 's native language			1
activists often object to measures that dilute the presence of native names , artwork and customs in the state , which joined the @entity113 only 55 years ago			2
none of the beach name - wrangling in @entity105 is related , however , to a momentary renaming of a famous @entity176 beach for the @entity113 president in 2009 by then - @entity179 prime minister @entity178			1
during a remembrance ceremony marking the 65th anniversary of the @entity182 at @entity183 , @entity178 referred to @entity184 as ' @entity185			0

nothing in @entity105 is named after the president , who was born there in 1961
@entity133 got complaints about renaming a beach ' president @entity4 @entity21 '
the president bodysurfed there in 2008 when he took a vacation from his first presidential campaign
a similar *rejection* followed a 2009 *attempt* to *rewrite* a law that prohibits naming public places after people who are still alive
concerns *included* some from the native hawaiian community who did n't want to dilute their language by giving up *traditional* names
