by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 12:12 est , 8 november 2012 autistic children could in the future be helped to learn by robot buddies in the classroom			1
evidence emerging from a trial at a school in @entity8 suggests that pupils who are on the autistic spectrum learn better from the automatons than human teachers			1
and researchers say that if they can be proven to help difficult to reach youngsters , then in the future they could also be used to help pupils in mainstream classes			1
@entity20 students @entity18 and @entity21 play with one of the @entity23 : evidence is emerging that suggests autistic children learn better from robots than human teachers @entity33 and @entity34 , two knee - high humanoid robots that can dance to @entity30 , play games and emulate @entity32 , have been helping pupils at @entity36 in @entity37 since march			1
@entity38 , headteacher at @entity20 , where about a quarter of the pupils are autistic , said the robots had been ' brilliant ' at supporting children with their learning			1
he told the @entity44 : ' the robots have no emotion , so autistic children find them less threatening than their teachers and easier to engage with			1
' @entity48 is a mainstream primary school that gets specialist funding to cater for autistic youngsters in separate classes using a range of technologies			1
with the help of the @entity57 , the school is trialling the robots as classroom buddies for autistic pupils in an initiative that aims to improve social interaction and communication			1
research shows that children with autism often find computers and technology safe , motivating and engaging , particularly in the areas of social interaction and communication			1
the robots , which cost around £ 15,000 and were donated by their @entity72 manufacturer @entity73 , are the latest in a range of innovative technologies that the school has been experimenting with			2
the robot dances for @entity18 : the machines , which cost £ 15,000 each and were donated by @entity72 robotics firm @entity73 , can dance to @entity30 , play games and demonstrate @entity32 robots might soon be able to use tools like @entity82 to solve complex problems by improvising with whatever everyday items they can find			2
a @entity87 funded research team are working on an automaton that can mimic the resourceful creativity of the @entity91 tv hero to escape from sticky situations			0
robots are increasingly being used to explore hazardous environments			0
but if one was trapped in a burning room by a jammed door , it could n't work out how to use nearby objects to climb over debris , pry open the door and escape			0
a research team led by professor @entity103 at the @entity104 hopes to change that by giving robots the ability to use objects in their environments to accomplish high - level tasks			2
' our goal is to develop a robot that behaves like @entity82 , ' he said , adding : ' we want to understand the basic cognitive processes that allow humans to take advantage of arbitrary objects in their environments as tools			0
' we will achieve this by designing algorithms for robots that make tasks that are impossible for a robot alone possible for a robot with tools			0
' dr @entity124 , from the @entity57 ’s @entity125 , said : ' we have been looking at how technology can support pupils with autism to communicate more effectively			1
' pupils and teachers are experimenting with the robots and other technologies in a developmental way and they are showing significant benefits for the classroom			2
' the robots have been modelling good behaviour and acting as buddies			0
' speaking to the @entity44 , she added : ' it is amazing to see how engaged and focused they can be when they are working with the robot			0
it can be very difficult to get children with autism to focus			2
' autistic children in particular find the technology predicable , but a well thought out programme could also work in mainstream classes , dr @entity124 added			1
mr @entity38 added : ' the robots have been brilliant at supporting autistic children with their learning			2
you can program them to teach language , play games and model behaviour			0
we have even used them in assemblies			0
' in the future we are looking to see if they can be used to support learning not just at school but at home as well			0
' the pupils are also taken with the tiny androids			0
seven - year - old @entity169 told @entity170 he likes playing memory games with the robots , while @entity18 and @entity173 say they like to watch their electronic buddies dance			0
teachers told @entity170 the fact that the normally reticent youngsters are so keen to discuss the robots shows their value in bringing autistic children out of their shell .			1

two humanoid robots have been trialled with autistic pupils at a @entity8 school since may
research shows children with autism find computers and technology safe , motivating and engaging
@entity57 researcher claims that one day the robots could also help pupils in mainstream classes
