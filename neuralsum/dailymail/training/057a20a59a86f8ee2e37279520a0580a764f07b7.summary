by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 24 october 2012 @entity1 cooled off on a @entity3 beach this weekend as her husband got fired up for the final presidential debate			1
as husband @entity6 indulged in a beach football game between his staffers and invited reporters , mrs @entity1 took advantage of the @entity3 sunshine in her fetching floral suit , going for a swim with her family at a public beach			1
the 63 - year - old wife of the @entity18 presidential candidate looked glamorous in the brightly - colored , halterneck suit with matching sarong on @entity21			1
she splashed around in the water with her son @entity23 , his wife @entity24 and grandchildren , before she grabbed a towel and headed for a hired sun lounger surrounded by other families			1
hours before they hit the beach , @entity41 and wife @entity1 were pictured attending church in @entity43 where she grabbed attention in a scarlet dress with full - length zip and chunky jewellery			1
although he did not attend the family outing , @entity41 organized a game of flag football between his staffers and pool reporters on @entity21 on sunday			1
the latest poll has @entity41 neck - and - neck with @entity55 as they each have 47 per cent of likely voters ahead of their debate this evening			1
monday 's face - off represents one of the last major opportunities for @entity55 and @entity41 to capture the attention of millions of voters - especially that small but sought - after group who have n't yet made up their minds			1
laughter : mrs @entity1 's daughter - in - law @entity24 affectionately ruffles her hair during the family day at the public beach glamor : the @entity18 candidate 's wife wraps up in a towel as she heads for a sun lounger with daughter - in - law @entity24 family trip : the @entity76 went almost unnoticed among other families at the @entity3 beach part of the crowd : the @entity18 candidate 's wife hired sun loungers at the beach surrounded by other families bold choice : mrs @entity1 took some time to relax ahead of her husband 's final presidential debate in @entity3 tonight @entity88 : @entity1 went virtually unnoticed on the @entity3 beach although the @entity39 were close at hand and while the former @entity91 governor was relaxing on the beach , @entity55 was holed up in @entity93 in @entity95 's @entity94			1
by @entity96 while most women of 63 would be hitting the beach in all - obscuring black , or shrouded in a loose cover - up , the trim mrs @entity1 knows she has nothing to hide			1
proving women in their sixth decade can have as much fun with swimwear as their daughters , the white floral - print number is a clever choice that flatters the figure without losing out on style			2
the punchy print , with its bright flowers , distract from any lumps and bumps beneath , as does the ruching across the midriff			2
the suit , which may actually be a tankini , though it is difficult to tell , appears to have some underwire to support the bust			2
this lends structure , helping to make the waist look smaller - and the wearer walk taller			2
a slim halterneck , too , is always pretty - a thicker strap style would have looked matronly with that print			2
and though mrs @entity1 has slim legs that a woman half her age would envy , the co-ordinating swim skirt covers her behind , allowing for a more modest look befitting her age , while the tie at the side can be adjusted so as not to cut into the waist			0
the president had arrived on friday to prep for the debate , a 90 - minute encounter focused on international affairs			0
mrs @entity1 has given @entity55 , noted for her sartorial choices , a run for her money on the campaign trail			0
last week she attended the annual @entity146 dinner at the @entity147 in @entity148 in a sweeping black and white gown and cape			0
at the second presidential debate in @entity148 , both mrs @entity1 and the @entity151 appeared in bright pink which fashion bloggers noted was in honor of breast cancer awareness month			0
mrs @entity1 has herself battled breast cancer and also spoke this weekend about her struggle with @entity160 , when she visited a @entity162 restaurant in @entity3			0
@entity41 was diagnosed in 1998 with the incurable neurological disease , which attacks the central nervous system and immobilizes many of its victims			0
mrs @entity1 said she was an avid tennis player when she first started noticing her symptoms , which primarily affected her balance and coordination			0
' it was really tough on my balance , ' she said			0
' i could n't figure out what was going on			0
' that was sort of what was happening			0
i was trying to figure out what was going on , what was wrong with me			0
' master of ceremonies : @entity41 , who was at the beach separately from his wife , organized a game of flag football between the pool reporters who cover his campaign and his staffers @entity188 - eyed : @entity6 and @entity1 were in @entity3 over the weekend , attending church on sunday and preparing for the third and final debate on monday			1
