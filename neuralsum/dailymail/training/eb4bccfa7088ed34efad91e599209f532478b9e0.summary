in another piece of footage you can audibly here someone scream ‘ stop ! there ’s an old woman here ! ’ , in another a man says ' i told you it was going to be like this ' and in another a siren sounds , but to no avail as the crowds are just concerned about getting their hands on a precious phone			1
for $ 45 , customers purchase a @entity55 , which comes with a free @entity57 handset and 30 days free calls , texts and web access			1
crowd of eager shoppers are shown pushing and fighting each other as they battle to get at a display stands loaded with cheap cellphones , which within seconds are stripped clean as if attacked by a hoard of locusts			0
the scenes of frenzied @entity9 shoppers more closely resemble hoards of starving refugees clamoring for vital supplies rather than bargain shoppers slugging it out for a cheap phone			2
this year many of the nation 's shoppers had their turkey dinner extra early to take advantage of thursday evening openings at many stores			1
stores typically open in the wee hours of the morning on the day after @entity84 that 's named @entity9 because that is when they traditionally turn a profit for the year			1
but @entity9 openings have crept earlier and earlier over the past few years			0
now , stores from @entity89 to @entity90 open their doors as early as @entity84 evening			2
@entity89 opened its doors at 9 p.m. on the holiday , three hours earlier than last year			0
@entity94 , which did n't open on @entity84 last year , opened at 8 p.m. on thursday through 10 p.m. on @entity9			0
@entity90 opened at 8 p.m. , an hour earlier than last year			0
and scores of other stores such as @entity97 's opened at midnight on @entity9			1
near - riot : crowds at @entity1 battle it out for the bargain cellphone deal video : shoppers fight over cheap cellphones at @entity105 stores video : near - riot over the cell phones in @entity16 , @entity17 the earlier hours are an effort by stores to make shopping more convenient for @entity7 , who still face economic uncertainty			1
many shoppers are worried about high unemployment and a package of tax increases and spending cuts known as the ‘ fiscal cliff ’ that will take effect in january unless @entity120 passes a budget deal by then			2
at the same time , @entity7 have grown more comfortable shopping on websites such as @entity124 , where they can get cheaper prices and buy from the comfort of their home or office cubicle			0
‘ i ate my turkey dinner and came right here , ’ said @entity131 , a 23 - year - old student in @entity132 who bought a 50 - inch @entity133 for $ 349 and a singer sewing machine for $ 50			1
‘ then i 'm going home and eating more			0
’ indeed , retailers were betting that the earlier openings would draw shoppers who prefer to head to stores after their pumpkin pie rather than get up early the next morning			2
when @entity97 's flagship @entity145 store in @entity132 opened its doors at midnight , for instance , about 11,000 shoppers showed up			2
overall , about 17 percent of shoppers said earlier this month that they planned to take advantage of @entity84 hours , according to an @entity150 - @entity152 survey of 1,000 consumers			2
bargain hunter : a lady in a blue top fights through the crowds to get at the phones suddenly there is a surge and the woman in blue gets pushed back but not to be outdone , the lady in blue uses her bulk to push past her rivals as she fights to get to the goods finally the woman muscles her way to the front and grabs herself a cheap phone in addition to expanding their hours , many also are offering free layaways and shipping , matching the cheaper prices of online rivals and updating their mobile shopping apps with more information			1
‘ every retailer wants to beat everyone else , ’ said @entity181 , chairman of @entity7 's @entity182 , a research firm based in @entity184 , @entity185 ‘ shoppers love it			2
’ hardcore holiday shoppers took advantage of the earlier hours			0
there were 11 shoppers in a four - tent encampment outside a @entity194 near @entity195 , @entity196 , in the afternoon on @entity84			2
the purpose of their wait ? a $ 179 40 - inch @entity200 television is worth missing @entity84 dinner at home			1
@entity203 , 26 , of @entity195 , arrived first with her stepson and a friend wednesday afternoon , seeking three of the televisions			0
the deal makes the @entity209 $ 240 less than their normal price , so @entity203 says that she 'll save more than $ 700			1
that has put pressure on brick - and - mortar stores , which can make up to 40 percent of their annual revenue during the two - month holiday shopping season , to compete			1
that 's becoming more difficult : the @entity218 , an industry trade group , estimates that overall sales in november and december will rise 4.1 percent this year to $ 586.1 billion , or about flat with last year 's growth			1
but the online part of that is expected to rise 15 percent to $ 68.4 billion , according to @entity223			2
as a result , brick - and - mortar retailers are trying everything they can to lure consumers into stores by making shopping as easy as possible			1
they tested the earlier hours last year , but this year more stores decided to open their doors on @entity84			2
survival of the fittest : a man in a brown shirt manages to battle his way to the front and grab a phone as he looks to escape the crowd , he has to hold on tightly to his bargain to ensure no one else gets it the brown - shirted man can be seen ducking into the crowd to ensure he escapes with his bounty it 's her first time camping out for the specials , and she 's not sure she will do it again			1
relatives will bring her some holiday dinner , but she 'll miss eating her dad 's stuffing right as he cooks it			0
‘ we 'll miss the actual being there with family , but we 'll have the rest of the weekend for that , ’ she @entity252 , 33 , and her sister @entity253 , 21 , showed up at @entity89 in @entity255 neighborhood of @entity132 at 7 p.m. their goal was to buy several @entity258 , which were on sale for $ 49			0
but while waiting in line they were also using their iphone to do some online buying at rival stores			0
‘ if you 're going to spend , i want to make it worth it , ’ said @entity253 , a college student , who spent a total of $ 175 on @entity124 , @entity194 and @entity270 during her two - hour wait			1
while shoppers snagged early deals , some workers were expected to protest the earlier hours			0
in fact , a @entity132 - based union - backed group of retail workers called @entity282 is planning protests in the @entity285 borough of @entity132 on @entity84 in front of several stores , including @entity288 , @entity289 and others that are opening at midnight on @entity9 and earlier			1
‘ it shows that the companies are not valuing their workers			0
they 're looking to their workers to squeeze out more profits , ’ said @entity291 , director of @entity282			0
@entity1 , the world 's largest retailer , has been one of the biggest targets of protests against holiday hours			1
many of the company 's stores are open 24 hours , but the company is offering early bird specials that once were reserved for @entity9 at 8 p.m. on @entity84 instead			1
crowds at @entity1 stores battle it out for cheap cellphones the issue is part of a broader campaign against the company 's treatment of workers that 's being waged by a union - backed group called @entity319 , which includes former and current workers			1
the group is staging demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores on @entity9			0
@entity326 , a @entity1 employee in @entity327 , @entity328 , who is a member of @entity319 , started an online petition on signon.org that has about 34,000 signatures			1
‘ this @entity84 , while millions of families plan to spend quality time with their loved ones , @entity1 associates have been told we will be stocking shelves and preparing sales starting at 8 p.m. , ’ she wrote on the site			1
shortly after midnight , @entity319 said workers walked off their jobs in stores in @entity343 , @entity344 and @entity327 , @entity328 , on thursday			0
but a spokeswoman for the group did not immediately give numbers on how many workers participated			0
for their part , retailers say they are giving shoppers what they want			0
@entity353 , a @entity1 spokesman , said that the discounter learned from shoppers that they want to start shopping right after @entity84 dinner			2
then , they want to have time to go to bed before they wake up to head back out to the stores			0
still , @entity353 said that @entity1 works to accommodate its workers ' requests for different working hours			2
‘ we spent a lot of time talking to them , trying to figure out when would be the best time for our events , ’ he said.kathee @entity364 , @entity89 's executive vice president of merchandising , said @entity89 's 9 p.m. opening struck ‘ a perfect balance ’ for its customers			0
when asked whether it 's faced any criticism from @entity89 employees , she noted that the chain also works with workers to accommodate their needs			0
but , ultimately the company serves the customer			0
‘ we thought long and hard about when the right opening time would be , ’ she said , adding that @entity89 ‘ wants to make sure we are competitive			0
