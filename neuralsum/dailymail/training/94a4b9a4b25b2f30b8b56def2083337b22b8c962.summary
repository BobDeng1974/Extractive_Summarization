a mother has hit out at environment authorities after a huge wall was built in front of her home as part of a flood defence scheme			1
@entity7 was left furious after the sea wall completely ruined the view she used to enjoy from her kitchen window , which looked out over the pretty @entity11 in @entity12			1
the 33 - year - old claims the wall is bigger than that shown on plans and wants viewing panels inserted into the flood defence wall			1
@entity7 is angry after flood defences she was assured would be no higher than her windowsills blocked out the sea view from her home in @entity12 mrs @entity7 says the view was one of the main reasons she and her husband bought their home on the @entity27 , west of @entity28			1
but her view was wrecked earlier this year when @entity30 installed a sea wall to protect the area from flooding			2
she said : ' i burst into tears when i saw what they had done			0
i used to have uninterrupted views across the estuary , now it 's a concrete wall			0
' mrs @entity7 and her husband attended ' drop - in sessions ' to look at the plans when they were announced and insists the designs showed a wall which only came up to her windowsill			0
but she says the wall which has been built is actually much taller			0
mrs @entity7 has demanded glass viewing panels be built into the wall to restore her view of the estuary she added : ' had i known what i know now i would have objected to the plans			1
' @entity30 say the seawall is the same height as the planning consent and the designs were discussed with residents			0
but a spokesman admitted : ' the impact at mrs @entity7 's house may be more pronounced than for other properties as it is further out due to the large foundations of the existing seawall and house			2
' they said its £ 1.6 million scheme will protect 150 properties and that adding glass panels to sections of the wall would cost an extra £ 700,000 .			0

*couple* bought house because of *beautiful* views of @entity11
they did not object to wall which was ' no higher than kitchen windowsill '
but they were *shocked* when the flood defence was built and *cut* out view
they want viewing glass built into the wall so their view can be restored
authorities admit existing foundations meant wall was built further away
