by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is confident he will make a fourth consecutive @entity4 appearance one way or the other at @entity7 next month			1
a run of three top - 10 - finishes after a successful title defence at the @entity11 lifted @entity2 into the automatic qualifying places at the start of the @entity14			1
but with less than three points separating @entity2 , @entity18 and @entity19 in eighth , ninth and 10th in the standings respectively , the former @entity16 champion could still need to rely on a wild card from @entity23 captain @entity22			1
teeing off : @entity2 watches his tee shot at the eighth in a round that was wrecked by a quadruple - bogey ' i want to be in the automatic spots if i possibly can , ' said @entity2 , who has just one qualifying event left on his schedule , the first @entity33 event in a fortnight 's time			1
' i will be going out there tomorrow all guns blazing and trying to shoot a low number to finish the week			2
@entity4 is very , very important to me			0
' i 'm not uncomfortable			0
i 'm optimisitic about the way i 'm playing , i 'm optimisitc about my chances of finishing in the automatic spots and i 'd be farily optimistic of the chances of a pick			0
i am not really too worried about it			0
' my form the last couple of months has certainly shown the captain that i 'm playing well			0
i will take a week off then get ready for the play - offs , keep some energy in the tank			0
' i think i am pretty much guaranteed ( to qualify for ) the first three play - offs , but we are having our baby the second week so i will spend that week at home and experience that next chapter in my life			0
' @entity2 , who secured the winning point at @entity57 in 2010 , was in the first group out in the third round at @entity60 and finished play before tournament officials were ready to record his score and that of playing partner @entity64			1
not his day : it 's been a tough tournament for the @entity67 who does n't have the power to compete in @entity2 's case it was a level - par 71 which featured four birdies but a quadruple - bogey eight on the 13th , where he hit two approach shots into water surrounding the green			1
' i played beautifully this morning , it 's so disappointing to make an elementary quadruple bogey , a card - wrecker , tournament - wrecker , weekend - wrecker , all of the above really , ' @entity2 added			1
' i think there might have been mud on the first ball but my second attempt was a bad shot			1
' this was not really a course i was going to be able to compete on			2
i 'm 71st in driving distance this week out of the 74 players who made the cut			0
the damage was done thursday , i did n't really feel myself			2
my lower back was in bad shape on friday and this morning was the only day i felt ready for it			2
' it 's a slog out there when you are only moving it 280 ( yards ) off the tee			0
you say ' only ' 280 but it really is in this day and age when @entity108 is flying it 320 , @entity104 is flying it 330			2
i am four shots behind these guys before i tee it up each day so i have to play very well elsewhere which i just have n't done			1
' i 'm literally wearing the grooves off my 5 - wood , 3 - hybrid and my four and five irons			0

@entity2 is currently in the qualifying positions for @entity23 team
only three points separate him from @entity19 and @entity18
@entity2 shot a level par 71 on day three at @entity60
but @entity67 admits he does n't have the power to compete
