by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 28 march 2013 @entity2 's first column for @entity4 magazine has been unveiled today , confirming the duchess ' sister 's ascent from party planner to professional foodie			1
the @entity11 feast boasts five recipes across five pages of the glossy magazine , all of which have been tried and tested by @entity2 herself			1
and while many were braced for the sort of facile recipes that were so roundly criticised when @entity2 released her much - lampooned guide to entertaining last year , here there are plenty of ideas for the budding chef - and even the more experienced home cook - to get their teeth into - even if there is very little real cooking involved			1
but a closer look at the recipes - using many exotic ingredients that would cost around £ 115 to buy from scratch - reveals that the portions allocated for each diner are , for a meal termed a ' feast ' , actually minute			1
to double up would be to incur costs of £ 215 for one meal			2
@entity2 's first column has been unveiled - will it silence the critics who did n't think the duchess 's sister had anything to offer the @entity4 customer ? some of the ideas have merit			1
there 's an interesting take on a classic cocktail in the shape of a ginger mojito garnished with red chilli and fresh mint			1
some rather attractive looking @entity54 spring rolls use ready - cooked prawns and require assembly only			1
demanding zero expertise in the kitchen , yes			0
but also tasty and impressive as a light starter			0
although make no mistake : they need plenty of careful attention to look as good as @entity2 's			2
simple but impressive : @entity54 spring rolls similar to those in @entity2 's @entity4 column there are traditional hoisin duck rolls too , which as @entity2 says , go down a storm			1
' make sure you make more than you think you 'll need ' , she counsels - although at £ 4 a pack for the duck breast , and with four packs needed to double up on the recipe to allow for those extras , that makes £ 16 spent on duck alone			1
omelette sushi , which @entity2 says she used to make while at @entity80 ( none of the usual @entity82 and corned beef hash for @entity2 's pals then ) is a less enticing prospect			2
fine for student fodder , the egg , red pepper or smoked salmon - filled rice rolls are not likely to impress too many guests at a more accomplished dinner party chef 's @entity91			1
the @entity95 feast is rounded off with tangerine and sake jellies with coconut cream , which involves juicing two 600g bags of tangerines - fine if you are a socialite with plenty of time on your hands ; a bind if you have three children demanding their @entity107 and a go on your @entity108			1
still , the jelly - a fruity concoction of tangerines , sake and fresh mint tempered with a swirl of rich coconut cream - certainly sounds enticing enough to have bags of fruit and cans of coconut flying off the shelves , which is surely half the point			2
the only drawback is that this seems to be lacking the main event			0
with just one spring roll , a couple of small duck pancakes and a jelly as sustenance , let 's hope guests are n't drinking more than the welcome mojito			1
@entity2 introduces her new column saying that friday night is the ' perfect time to cook			0
' ' regardless of how tired i might be , the moment friday lunchtime arrives i get that contagious pre-weekend excitement , ' she says			0
' fridays , of course , hold the promise of the weekend but also , being far enough away from @entity142 melancholy , feel freer			0
' all of which is why friday , rather than saturday , is the night to feast ! ' @entity144 , editor of @entity4 magazine , defended his newest columnist , calling her ' fantastic ' and ' tremendous ' @entity2 explains her decision to pick an @entity11 feast for her first column , saying she has always loved the flavours from countries like @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
@entity2 includes a disclaimer , saying that while some of the elements of the feast may seem ' too fussy ' to make at home , the recipes actually require ' no @entity162 trips ' and ' hardly any cooking '			1
ahead of the column 's publication , critics expressed their fears that the young novice would have nothing to offer the @entity4 customer			0
but with these recipes , which - with the exception of the hoisin duck rolls - are outside the repertoire of most @entity176 housewives - will surely inspire experimentation at some level among the footsure client base			1
the culinary skills of @entity2 were defended by the editor of @entity4 magazine , who responded to critics who said the young novice had nothing to offer the @entity4 customer			1
@entity144 called @entity2 ' tremendous ' , and said that @entity2 's @entity184 would be ' fantastic '			1
he accused her doubters of being jealous of her good fortune and skills			0
he went on to compare @entity190 's sister 's ideas to those of @entity193 - trained chef @entity192 and @entity194 , the man behind one of @entity197 's leading tapas restaurants , @entity198			0
speaking to local radio station @entity199 , @entity144 said : ' she 's on tremendous form			2
the first column comes out next week so we can expect the usual flurry of abuse from newspapers and food bloggers who are jealous that they have n't got columns			2
' in the mix of the magazine , her stuff is fantastic			0
she 's there alongside @entity192 and some other up - and - coming chefs like @entity194 from @entity198			0
' you 'll still see an array of talent that we use			0
she 's done her very first series as an @entity11 - themed friday night feast and i think people will enjoy it			2
when people see the work that she 's doing , they 'll calm down			0
' and you certainly can not fault @entity2 's enthusiasm			0
in the final line of her introductory words , she says she can ' feel the friday energy already '			0
' friends released from work , hair down , ties loosened and heels clattering in an excited scramble - especially if it 's to my place ! '			0
@entity2 released her first book , party - planning guide celebrate , in october 2012 , but has since parted ways with her literary agent after the tome did not sell well @entity2 released her first book - a guide to party - planning , which did include several recipes - in october last year			1
but she has since parted ways with her agent			0
celebrate : a @entity250 reportedly netted @entity2 a £ 400,000 advance from publisher @entity252			2
but her agent @entity253 last week confirmed that he and the middle child of the @entity255 were no longer working together			0
@entity2 also runs her own online magazine , @entity256 , an offshoot of her family 's @entity259 business .			2
