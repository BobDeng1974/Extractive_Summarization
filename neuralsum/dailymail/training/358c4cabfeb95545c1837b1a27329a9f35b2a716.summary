it has already raised millions for ebola victims and is set to go to number one in the charts			2
but the latest @entity5 single was yesterday branded ‘ patronising ’ by @entity7 academics and a rapper revealed he pulled out of the recording in protest			1
some said the revised lyrics of @entity13 ? perpetuate ‘ negative stereotypes ’ about @entity7 , and claimed it ignores the fact ebola has struck largely @entity19 countries where most people do not celebrate december 25			1
meanwhile @entity37 - @entity36 rapper @entity35 revealed he pulled out of the project last weekend because he disagreed with the lyrics , which have been revised since the first @entity5 track in 1984			1
writing on @entity42 , the 26 - year - old said he felt the message of the song was ‘ not in line ’ with his own thoughts on how to help @entity7			1
sir @entity22 supported his decision , adding : ‘ he said he just felt awkward ’			1
but the @entity50 star , 63 , responded furiously to his other critics			2
appearing on @entity23 he said their concerns were a ‘ complete load of b * * * * * * * ’			0

it became the fastest selling record of the year with 206,000 sales since monday but @entity72 academic @entity71 , 32 , who studies at the @entity73 in @entity74 , said the lyrics are ‘ incredibly patronising and problematic ’			2
she told @entity77 ’s today programme : ‘ it paints the continent as unchanging and frozen in time			0
if you look at the revised lyrics , there are references to ‘ them ’ versus ‘ us ’			0
‘ and the fact of the matter is , if you look at countries that have been most affected by @entity91 , the vast majority of the population in @entity88 is @entity19 , the vast majority of the population in @entity94 is @entity19			1
yes , we know it is @entity62 , but not all of us celebrate @entity62			1
’ @entity37 - @entity36 rapper @entity35 revealed he pulled out of the project last weekend because he disagreed with the lyrics of the @entity5 single when it was first released in 1984 , the @entity13 ? came under fire for perceived inaccuracies and offensive lyrics			1
at the time , the line ‘ there wo n’t be snow in @entity7 ’ was criticised by those who pointed out there is snow in some parts of the continent			2
@entity111 singer @entity110 – who also recorded the latest version – later admitted he ‘ loathed ’ another line which said : ‘ well tonight thank @entity115 it ’s them instead of you			0
’ this year , it was replaced with the words ‘ well tonight we ’re reaching out and touching you ’ , while the line ‘ where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears ’ was replaced with ‘ where a kiss of love can kill you and there ’s death in every tear			0
’ however , miss @entity71 said it was wrong to suggest that every person infected with @entity91 would die , adding : ‘ @entity133 , doom and destruction			0

speaking to @entity139 news , @entity136 , 31 , a human rights activist from @entity137 , said she objected to ‘ celebrities swooping in to “ save ” the people of @entity7			2
’ she added : ‘ it perpetuates stereotypes of conflict , poverty and disease as the single story of the continent			0
’ @entity149 , 31 , a policy analyst from @entity150 , said he thought the lyrics were ‘ grotesque ’ , adding : ‘ it was awful 30 years ago , and it ’s awful today			0
’ @entity154 , 26 , a financial analyst from @entity155 said : ‘ i would ask does @entity22 know when it ’s @entity62 time in @entity155 ? as perhaps the fact that we celebrate @entity62 a few weeks later on the 7th of january could have misled him into thinking we do n’t know when it is			1
‘ reassure him from us that , after his last three reminders , we are well aware and do n’t need any more prompting			0
’ miss @entity71 said @entity5 should have supported @entity7 artists , such as @entity72 musicians @entity162 and @entity164 , who have released similar tracks to raise money for @entity91			2
but producer @entity167 , who helped create the original @entity5 and who produced the @entity170 concerts , said her concerns were ‘ ridiculous ’			0
he told today : ‘ i think it ’s disingenuous for people to turn round and say we should n’t do anything or sit back and watch it all happen or wait for all those countries that pledged aid and refused to give it so far			0
