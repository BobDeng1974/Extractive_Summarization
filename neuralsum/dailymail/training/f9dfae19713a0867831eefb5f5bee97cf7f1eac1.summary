a country pub where prince @entity1 once enjoyed romantic evenings with his then - girlfriend @entity3 has received a zero rating for food hygiene			1
the @entity6 , in @entity7 , @entity8 , was investigated after a complaint , with the local council telling the business that there are ' clearly problems with managing food safety '			1
in the run - up to the announcement their engagement in november 2010 , the @entity17 and @entity3 were regularly spotted emerging arm - in - arm from the pub - and , on one occasion , enjoying a passionate embrace			1
low marks : @entity24 in @entity7 was given a zero rating for food hygiene favourite spot : the @entity17 and @entity3 were once regulars at the @entity8 drinking spot improving : landlord @entity30 says the pub has now overhauled its food preparation romantic : the couple were spotted enjoying several meals in the pub ahead of their 2010 engagement but in the four years since the royal engagement , standards at the pub appear to have dropped - so much so it became the only business in north @entity8 to get a zero rating this year			1
food hygiene , which is given a mark out of five , got zero - the worst rating - which means that drastic improvements are required			2
pub co-owner @entity30 said : ' on the august bank holiday , on which we were holding our annual @entity50 festival , we were inspected by the @entity8 food hygiene team			1
' we were carrying more stock than is normal given the business levels expected over the weekend , we were also let down by a member of the team who was not following our food storage guidelines			0
' this member of the team has since been removed from his post			0
' we would like to assure the general public that all recommendations given have been adopted and all paperwork that was missing was instantly put in place and is up to date			0
' we have recently been re-checked by the @entity8 food hygiene team who have assured us that upon a re-scoring we will be reinstated to a top score , as we have been since we opened			2
' we do sincerely apologise to our customers for this unintended oversight			0
' a spokesman for @entity70 said it inspected the pub following a complaint and there were ' clearly problems with managing food safety '			2
he added : ' our food safety officers gave instruction on what needed to be done to address these issues and since revisiting we can confirm these have been resolved and the owner has said he will apply for a review of his previous food hygiene rating score			1
' when deciding on a rating council officers check how hygienically food is handled , the condition of the building and how the business manages its processes to make sure food is kept safely			0
to get a zero , a business must perform poorly in all three of these categories .			0
