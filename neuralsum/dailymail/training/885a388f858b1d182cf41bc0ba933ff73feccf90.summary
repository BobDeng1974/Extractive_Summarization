disposable contact lenses have been developed which mimic the surface of the eye – making them the most comfortable yet , according to wearers			1
they have been created specially for middle - aged people who have trouble reading but have been put off wearing contacts because they irritate the eyes by drying them out			2
the lenses are made of a new material called @entity13 which has the same water content as the cornea and double that of standard silicone contacts			1
it all means they not do dry out the eyes as much and become uncomfortable for wearers			0
the contacts were engineered for people with presbyopia – age - related loss of focus , which affects more than half of adults over 40			1
the condition occurs when the crystalline lens of the eye ages and loses flexibility			0
as a result , those with the condition might have to hold newspapers or restaurant menus further away to read them easily			0
but older people are less likely to wear contacts to correct their vision because their eyes tend to be drier			2
@entity55 - based contact lens optician @entity53 said the @entity25 lenses , which are available on the high street , help avoid dehydration of the eye , with less than 2 per cent of water lost during a day ’s wear			1
‘ it makes them extremely comfortable to wear and the whole process less daunting , ’ she said			0
‘ i had a man in his 50s – a first - time contact lens wearer – in my practice today who said he could not feel them at all			0
’ @entity72 , an optometrist and adviser to @entity74 , an independent eye - care panel supported by @entity75 , makers of the new lenses , said the one - a - day , disposable contacts have added hygiene advantages			2
reusable , soft contacts must be cleaned and disinfected after every use to prevent a build - up of bacteria and proteins			0
the new contacts cost between £ 40 and £ 60 a month , depending on individual practitioners ’ prices .			1

@entity25 contact lenses have the same water content as the human cornea
they are also breathable , allowing for 93 per cent transmission of oxygen
the new contacts cost between £ 40 and £ 60 a month for daily lenses
