@entity0 , the justice minister , will close a legal loophole to ensure driving bans for those jailed for causing deaths start when they are released dangerous drivers who have killed on the roads in the @entity7 will banned from getting behind the wheel for longer under new plans being considered by the government			1
at the moment driving bans begin as soon as sentences begin , which means most people jailed for causing death by dangerous driving serve out their bans while in prison			1
but under a new scheme announced by @entity0 , the justice minister , the bans will only come into force once offenders have left prison - keeping dangerous drivers off the roads for longer			1
he called the current system - allowing offenders to get behind the wheel soon after being released - was ' abhorrent			1
' ' if you have lost a loved one to a motorist who was drunk , driving recklessly or using a mobile phone , it is nothing short of an insult to see the killer leave prison and get straight behind the wheel of a car again , ' he told the @entity39			2
the new measures will build on a pledge by ministers to allow judges to extend the period that dangerous drivers who cause deaths are kept off the roads			1
campaign group @entity47 said that fewer than one in 10 drivers who caused deaths are banned from getting back behind the wheel for more than three years			0
mr @entity0 said he plans to use powers in the @entity52 to ensure driving bans for dangerous drivers who cause deaths begin only on the day they leave prison			1
he said the rules could be in force in weeks			0
campaigners have also called for reckless drivers to be given longer sentences , with around just two thirds of drivers convicted of causing death by dangerous or careless driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol being jailed for five years or less			2
the maximum sentence is 14 years in prison			0
government plans to give judges more powers to impose longer driving bans have stalled recently and have been stuck during debate stages at the @entity75 and @entity76			2
the new regulations could affect the sentences of dangerous drivers like @entity80 , 27 ( left ) who was using his mobile phone when he crashed head - on into the car being driven by @entity84 , 28 ( right ) the new rules could affect drivers like @entity80 , 27 who killed a young solicitors clerk when he got behind the wheel drunk , and was texting as he drove along			2
@entity80 , of @entity90 in the @entity91 , was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message			0
as he was reading or replying to it , he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into 28 - year - old @entity84 â€™s car coming the other way			0
she later died of her injuries			0
he was jailed for six years and banned from driving for eight , after which he will have to complete an extended driving test .			0

drivers who cause death on the roads to be banned from driving for longer
under current rules driving bans begin the moment offender is sentenced
this means dangerous drivers often serve out bans while they are in prison
@entity0 , the justice minister , said the current system is ' abhorrent '
he wants driving bans to start when offenders are released from prison
the rules , to be *launched* in weeks , will ban dangerous drivers for longer
