@entity9 ’s history of mental - health issues was raised as one of several warning signs outlined in a @entity43 ( @entity45 ) report released earlier this month , according to @entity47 @entity46			0
the department revealed that it had received several calls from @entity9 ’s divorce lawyer regarding his mental state			1
just 12 hours before he allegedly threw his daughter to her death , his own lawyer called a state child abuse hotline warning that his client was suffering from mental delusions			1
but according to documents released by child welfare officials on monday , the hotline operator failed to pass on the call to investigators because she did n't think the child was in danger			2
at the time he dropped the girl more than 60 feet off the bridge , @entity9 was expressing paranoid fears that @entity20 was n't his biological daughter memorials have been set up in honor of the late @entity20			1
police say @entity9 pulled over on the @entity15 in @entity16 january 8 , pulled @entity20 from the back seat and dropped her to her death one week earlier , another worried caller told the @entity75 that @entity9 's daughter @entity20 had been physically abused in the past			1
that call , however , also failed to get to @entity45 investigators because the operator hung up before she got @entity9 's address			1
instead of calling back , she simply closed the case , according to the state 's investigation			0
police say @entity14 was likely alive when her father sped past a police officer , stopped on the @entity15 , pulled the girl from the back seat and dropped her to her death			0
@entity9 's own divorce lawyer had warned authorities of his mental state january 7 , telling the hotline operator that @entity9 had driven to three different churches in his pajamas with @entity20 in tow and asked his attorney to translate a @entity101 @entity100 into @entity102			1
@entity9 was also expressing paranoid fears that @entity20 was not his biological daughter , his lawyer said			2
@entity20 's mother @entity105 is helped away from her daughter 's funeral last month			0
@entity14 was in the custody of her father when he threw his child to her death ' he 's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his , it just really concerns me , ' the unidentified attorney told an operator , later adding , ' it 's all craziness and it does n't make any sense and he 's out of his mind			2
' but the report noted the relatively inexperienced operator said the caller seemed more worried about @entity9 's mental state , not the child 's safety and labeled the call as ' inadequate supervision ' and did not turn it over to investigators			1
the attorney even noted that @entity45 had an open investigation on the family , but the operator said she could n't find the report and did not ask a supervisor , according to the state 's investigation			2
the missing report came from a caller who alleged family violence , inadequate supervision and substance misuse at the @entity9 home			0
' we are reminded yet again that every process within our system should be critically examined at every opportunity to ensure that the role it plays is carried out effectively , ' @entity142 said in the report			0
a call in june of 2013 first brought child investigators to the @entity9 home where they closed the case , agreeing that family violence threatened @entity20			0
@entity9 was arrested as a result of the call after an altercation with @entity20 's mother			2
he and @entity20 later moved out of the home , but the report released earlier this month noted that no services or interventions were put in place .			0
