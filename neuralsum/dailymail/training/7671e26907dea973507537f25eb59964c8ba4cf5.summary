@entity12 's current favourite to win at 3/1 is grandmother of eight @entity14 who took the prized title of @entity16 for her ' @entity17 ' yesterday			1

' she even used a homemade cake guillotine to ensure precise symmetry			2
the former practice manager at @entity36 in @entity22 discovered a passion for baking after retiring seven years ago			1
she was selected as a contestant for this year 's series after a failed application last year , and is one of 12 amateurs looking to impress judges @entity44 and @entity46			0
@entity14 who took the prized title of @entity16 for her ' @entity17 ' yesterday she is one of 12 amateurs looking to impress judges @entity44 and @entity46 hot on her heels to win the baking contest , which has moved from @entity50 to @entity51 , is @entity52 the builder at 7/2			1
@entity55 contestant ever at just 17 , @entity9 is next with odds of 5/1			0
meanwhile , poor @entity10 was the first to exit , @entity12 now have the colourfully attired @entity57 at 5/4 as the next baker to leave as he failed to impress the judges			0
it would n't be a @entity1 without tears and tantrums and following the debut episode , @entity12 is offering odds of 2/1 of at least three contestants welling up by the third episode			1
although it 's the baking disaster cake lovers fear the most , the phrase ' soggy bottom ' comes a close second			0
it was used in jest last night but @entity12 offers odds at 7/4 that it will be used to describe a contestant 's creation by the third episode			0
dressed in a splendid floral design for episode one , it 's odds on at 1/2 that @entity44 will sport a floral blazer at least four times throughout the series			0
@entity12 's @entity82 says : ' the new series , although predictable , continues to receive rave reviews and shows no signs of falling flat , promising the usual helping of one - liners from @entity88 and dollops of innuendo from @entity46 and @entity44 , but all eyes will be on the contestants ' clever creations over the coming weeks			0
' at this stage we 're backing @entity14 to win , although as we all know , this can easily change with a " soggy bottom " ! ' the @entity1 is back and now on @entity51 , attracting an average 7.2 million viewers last night			1
