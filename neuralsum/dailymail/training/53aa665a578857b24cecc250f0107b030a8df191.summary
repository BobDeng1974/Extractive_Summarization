when you 're spending long hours at sea on a trawler ship , you have to get creative to keep yourself entertained			1
at least that 's what the crew of @entity5 believe , keeping their spirits up by making spoof pop videos			1
the crazy @entity10 , who spend their days trawling for prawns , even go as far as stripping off in the freezing weather to create their @entity15 videos			1
deckhand @entity16 has proved the most popular of the fishermen on @entity15 for his spoof of the @entity21 video @entity19 the team have recently diversified into parody news and weather broadcasts - complete with a tame seagull the most popular ' music video ' produced so far shows deckhand @entity28 starkers on a red buoy pretending to be @entity21 in @entity19			1
in another a fellow fisherman dons seaweed for dreadlocks and an enormous chain to pose as a rapper			1
the team have recently diversified into parody news and weather broadcasts - complete with a tame seagull			0
the boat is based at @entity38 , @entity39 , which is world famous for its seafood			1
as well as the @entity21 parody the team have produced their version of the the @entity45 song @entity44 , called @entity46 a rap spoof created by the crew also involves them wearing seaweed dreadlocks and giant boat chains around their necks @entity16 said : ' we can be away on the boat all week , but we could be landing our catch every couple of days			1
' it 's just for a bit of nonsense out in the boat , it 's a bit of a laugh when it 's quiet out on the deck			0
there 's not much on at this time of year			0
' as well as the @entity21 parody the team have produced their version of the the @entity45 song @entity44			1
called @entity46 , it features live prawns and fishermen skateboarding along deck wearing nothing but boxer shorts			1
and a painstakingly choreographed dance to recent smash hit pop song ' @entity74 ' , by @entity77 artist @entity76 featuring k $ ha , shows the lads dancing on the roof of the cabin with no land in sight			2
@entity16 poses on a skateboard during the @entity45 parody @entity46 - which was among the vides filmed on @entity16 's mobile phone in some of the spoof newscasts a tame seagull joins @entity16 for an update on all current affairs from @entity5 the crew of five are often out at sea for days at a time , and work long hours fishing for prawns , so keep themselves entertained with videos most of the videos feature one or all of the crew in their underwear			1

when they saw that they said they would prefer it if it was n't me			0
' @entity16 defies the cold sea chill to don a racy leopard - print outfit to keep his colleagues humorously entertained he has worked as a fisherman since he left school aged 16 and insists safety remain a priority for the crew			1
he said : ' you make sure it 's all safe			0
you are still out at sea and you ca n't do too much nonsense			0
we can be out in some rough weather			0
you all need to pull together			0
' he recently decided to focus on parody news and weather reports , with several bulletins from the boat uploaded in the last week			0
@entity16 and fellow deckhand @entity142 , 42 , use a pile of empty fish boxes as a news desk and a wooden spoon for a microphone			2
prawn baskets serve as drums in a remake of @entity45 's 2002 hit @entity44 , ; their aptly - titled version is called ' @entity46 ' a @entity153 news reporter @entity142 makes sure those at home are kept up to date on recent events in the trawler a tame seagull has interrupted several of the videos by sitting on the boxes and flapping its wings			1
one report features crew members pretending to be sheep , and another shows a fisherman in yellow oilskins jumping out from under a pile of empty boxes			2
@entity16 , who edits the films once safely back on dry land , said : ' it 's a lot easier to do the news than music videos			2
