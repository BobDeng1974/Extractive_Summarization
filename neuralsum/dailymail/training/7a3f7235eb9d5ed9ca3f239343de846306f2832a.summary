split between @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , the 500,000 - strong @entity1 tribe might be numerous but their fascinating customs and religious beliefs are entirely unique			1
a nomadic people , their lives revolve around finding good grazing for their herds of camels and cattle , which combined , provide everything they need to survive in the striking semi-arid scrub land they inhabit			0
but while men dominate village life and are in charge of the herds , women play a vital role and are in sole charge of building @entity1 homes and performing the elaborate dances that signal the birth of a baby			1
dressed in her best : a @entity1 woman wearing traditional garb made from goat skins			2
the expensive dresses are now kept only for best rules : many of the @entity1 's rules apply to children , including a prohibition on addressing anyone older than themselves by their first name with so little water to be had , their beauty routine is an unusual one and involves anointing their locks with ghee ( clarified butter ) to keep hair smooth and shiny			1
girls are given the most striking hairdos and wear the crown of their heads shaved until they marry , at which point the hair is allowed to grow back while the rest is plaited into elaborate designs			1
but hair is n't the only part of life governed by the @entity1 's centuries - old laws			1
the majority of rules apply to children who , for instance , are n't allowed to call anyone older than themselves by their first names			2
those names are also governed by tribal law and are inspired by the time of day they were born			0
' boys born in broad daylight are always called @entity68 , ' explains photographer @entity69 who took these incredible pictures			0
' some are named after a major event , a ceremony ( @entity74 ) , a rainy season ( @entity76 ) or a dry season ( @entity78 )			2
others are named after weekdays while a few get odd names such as @entity81 ( ape ) , @entity83 ( nose ) , @entity85 ( tree stump ) and @entity87 ( lanky long legs )			2
' whatever their parents decide to call them , all children are given a place in the social pecking order at birth - and once done , it is rare for it to be changed			0
welcome : the birth of a baby of either gender is marked by a traditional women - only dance which welcomes the infant into the world hard work : women are in sole charge of building @entity1 homes and since they move four times a year , have to work extremely hard elaborate : a woman carries milk in an engraved gourd and shows off a bead ring ( left )			1
right : the chief 's wife is given special jewellery shaved : girls such as this one have the crowns of their heads shaved until marriage			1
afterwards , hair grows back and is plaited changing times : traditionally , the @entity1 believed in a single god called @entity121			1
now @entity122 and @entity123 are beginning to make inroads moving : many of the young people are leaving the tribe behind for jobs in town , among them this trio who send money home to their families screened : @entity1 women are not allowed to come face - to - face with their son - in - laws			1
if they do , both must immediately cover their faces the luckiest are the sons of village chiefs who are placed in the top grade , daballe , at birth and show their status with long locks that make them resemble girls			0
as future chiefs themselves , no one is allowed to punish them , even when they misbehave , while their mothers gain an honoured place in society and are frequently asked to bless well - wishers			2
these women are also given special jewellery to wear usually made from colourfully beaded leather , enlivened on occasion with recycled @entity160 caps			2
those who are n't married to a chief , although often forced to share a husband , do get some special benefits including being in sole charge of who can and can not enter their homes - spouses included			0
' a wife always decides who will enter in the house , ' explains @entity69			0
' if her husband comes back and finds another man â€™s spear stuck into the ground outside her house , he can not go in			0
' women are also in sole charge of raising their daughters and usually insist that they become excellent housewives			0
men , when they come to choose a wife , will often judge the girl by her mother , which makes getting it right all the more important			0
older women are honoured as the keepers of tribal lore , although not all of it makes sense to @entity194 ears			0
' old people are afraid of having their picture taken , ' says @entity69			0
' they believe that when you take their photo , you remove their blood and steal their shadow			1
' new religion : an increasing number of @entity1 are becoming @entity203 and have adopted @entity122 customs such as the headscarf respected : older women are honoured as keepers of village lore while this boy ( right ) is the son of a chief and can never be punished important man : this man is the overseer of one of the @entity1 's network of wells			1
it is taboo to fight over water chief : the @entity1 elect a leader every eight years			2
the ' father of the village ' wears a special headdress called a kalacha home : women have the final say on who can enter their homes			0
if a man finds another man 's spear outside his wife 's hut , he ca n't go in @entity233 : women are tasked with building all the houses , as well as dismantling and rebuilding them when the village moves on livelihood : the @entity1 's cattle and camels are their most precious possessions and are nearly always cared for by men			1

the majority of the 500,000 - strong @entity1 tribe live in @entity2 but some also live in @entity3 and @entity4
women use clarified butter ( ghee ) to keep their hair in perfect condition and wear it in elaborate plaits
girls have the crown of their heads shaved , with the hair only allowed to grow after they marry
other beliefs include the fear that having your photo taken removes some blood and steals your shadow
they also believe in a single god named @entity121 , although more are converting to @entity123 and @entity122
