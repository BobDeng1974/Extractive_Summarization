it might have taken eight years and £ 8,000 to build and have a flying time of just 18 seconds , but the designer of a pedal - powered aeroplane says he is delighted with his creation			1
@entity6 engineer @entity5 , 42 , who makes a living constructing racing car engines , built the unique man - powered plane in his own garage			1
and when @entity13 took off from @entity14 , @entity15 , in june , it became the first ever man - powered aircraft to take to the skies from the airport			1
' at the age of seven , i would go to the library and read about human powered aircraft and that ’s where the love came from			2
' @entity38 has a wing - span of 20 metres and is purposely made to be as light as possible from special carbon			1
it is powered solely by the pilot who pedals it like a bicycle			2
engineer @entity5 and dr @entity46 getting set for take off in the @entity48 - style plane @entity5 said : ' it was built on strength - to - weight radio so it is both resilient and flexible			2
' i ’ve made everything myself - and even bought a seven metre long oven so i could mould carbon around the shell			0
' the device is larger than most man - powered planes as he wanted to be able to fit in it himself			2
he said : ' other planes that are man - powered have been built for someone who is extremely fit and slender to pedal			1
' unfortunately , i am not an @entity65 athlete and wanted to be able to fly my own plane so i ’ve made it slightly bigger and possible for me to power myself			0
' @entity5 says that although it may look dangerous , flying his aircraft is no more dangerous than cycling @entity5 asked someone with experience in flying man - powered planes - dr @entity46 - to take the controls for the first time so he could concentrate on where improvements needed to be made			1
@entity5 said : ' i was overjoyed when i first saw it fly - it was almost a miracle to see it take off			0
' when the wings took lift , you could hear the cheers of the crowds who had come to support us - it was a great feeling			0
' @entity5 was delighted that flights in his plane last around 18 seconds at a speed of about 17mph			1
he said : ' it flew like a dream			0
i was completely prepared for it to fail , but it went marvellously			0
@entity5 said it was ' almost a miracle ' to see the aircraft , which he had spent £ 8,000 and eight years building , take off ' there ’s a fine line between it breaking because it has n’t been built properly or being too heavy so it would n’t take flight - luckily we got it just right			1
' it ’s a very special feeling to sit there pedalling and then be lifted into the air - it totally fulfilled my dreams			0
' you pedal really hard and then all of a sudden you are pedalling in mid-air , it ’s very surreal and you feel like a puppet			0
' during the week , mr @entity5 works at the @entity112 factory in @entity113 , working on engines for @entity6 drivers including @entity116 and @entity117			0
@entity5 added : ' people think it ’s quite high - risk flying a man - powered plane but the risk is pretty low			1
' if you were to fall , it would only be about as bad as a push - bike crash			0
' now @entity13 has completed its maiden flight at @entity128 , it will take part in a national competition for human - powered flying machines			2
the @entity133 ’s @entity133 competition will be held in @entity134 from july 13th to the 23rd			0
during the competition , @entity38 will compete against other man - powered planes in races , endurance tests and a slalom challenge			1

@entity5 , 42 , says that the pedal - powered aircraft which he built in his garage for £ 8,000 , fulfils a childhood dream for him
the plane - which has a wing - span of 20 metres - is powered entirely by the pilot who pedals it like a bicycle
aircraft ' @entity38 ' takes off for 18 seconds , *cruises* at a speed of 17mph and reaches an *altitude* of two metres
