from ancient mead - halls to modern pubs and clubs , it seems mankind has always enjoyed drinking - but the way we talk about alcohol has changed a lot over the centuries			1
whereas once the words ' drunken ' and ' inebriated ' sufficed to describe over-indulging , now we resort to elaborate euphemisms such as ' squiffy ' , ' blotto ' and ' wasted '			1
and in addition to modern slang for drinking , there are a host of now obsolete words once used to describe a heavy binge - the likes of ' bumpsy ' , ' suckey ' and ' hit under the wing '			1
in a new book , the academic reveals that the vocabulary of drinking is richer than almost any other topic - and unites english - speakers across barriers of class , age and gender			1
during the @entity39 period , the words ' drunken ' and ' fordrunken ' were the most common ways of describing alcoholic excess , professor @entity41 writes in the book words in @entity59 and @entity60			1
however , in time there developed ' a universal trend to avoid stating the obvious ' , according to the author , and @entity39 - speakers began to resort to euphemisms when they discussed drinking			1
@entity66 ( @entity39 ) : first used in @entity69 's translations of latin works , it continued in use throughout the @entity72 and is found in @entity74 's @entity73			1
@entity75 ( 1564 ) : a ' tippler ' was someone who sold ale in a tavern - the word is thought to be related to ' tap '			2
it later became attached to somone who drinks a lot			2
@entity86 ( 1611 ) : apparently inspired by the way drunkards are more likely to bump into things because they can not walk straight			2
the word ' bum ' was also a children 's word for a drink in the 16th century			2
@entity95 ( 1805 ) : a ' blooter ' is a clumsy oaf in medieval @entity99 slang , leading to the adjective meaning drunk which is still in use in @entity99 and @entity102			1
up the pole ( 1897 ) : a nautical term - the pole was the mast , so someone ' up the pole ' would be in a dangerous situation			2
it first appeared in the dictionary after a judge asked what it meant during a court case			0
@entity115 ( 1923 ) : military slang which has its origins in the @entity119 word ' pagal ' , meaning a madman or an idiot			0
it was used particularly when a drunk person was behaving wildly			1
tired and emotional ( 1981 ) : a modern euphemism usually used in a comic setting			0
the @entity126 first cites it in an episode of political sitcom yes minister			0
the earliest slang terms included the 14th - century ' cup - shotten ' , meaning overcome with liquor , ' inebriate ' , dating back to 1497 , and ' bousy ' - a forerunner of the modern ' booze ' , borrowed from @entity137 and first recorded in 1529			1
some words still in common usage have a long pedigree - for example ' intoxicated ' , which originally meant poisoned , was first used in relation to drink as far back as 1576			1
@entity142 and the @entity143 are commonly regarded as two of the greatest influences on the @entity39 language , and the situation is no different when it comes to phrases for drunkenness			1
' in drink ' was apparently coined by @entity142 in the play @entity153 1 , where @entity154 uses it while talking to @entity156 , and ' in their cups ' makes its first appearance in the @entity143 's description of how alcohol affects the mood			0
professor @entity41 divides the slang terms into a variety of different categories , based on the ways they characterise the process of losing control			1
he writes in the book : ' one fruitful vein is to find terms that characterize drunken appearance ( owl - eyed , pie - eyed , cock - eyed , lumpy , blue , lit ) or behaviour , especially erratic movement ( slewed , bumpsy , reeling ripe , towrow , rocky , on one ’s ear , zigzag , tipped , looped ) or lack of any movement at all ( stiff , paralytic )			1
' over the years , some drinkers appear to have viewed drunkenness as similar to being cooked - ' stewed ' , ' boiled ' , ' pickled ' and ' steamed ' have all arisen since the 18th century			0
while the origins of many terms - such as ' rummy ' and ' under the influence ' - may be relatively obvious , others are rather more complex			1
' three sheets in the wind ' , for instance , is a naval analogy - ' sheets ' are ropes attached to a sail , so when three of them are loose the sail will flap around and cause the boat to weave like a drunk person			1
change : but events such as @entity204 's @entity203 uphold traditional ways of drinking - and getting drunk contrast : now drinking increasingly centres on bars and clubs which serve shots of spirits such as tequila work : @entity41 explores how @entity39 has been adapted over time in his new book , pictured a minority of words attempt the subtle task of describing someone who is only a little drunk , such as ' squiffy ' , popularised by the novels of @entity221 , and ' half - shaved ' , used in the @entity222 during the 19th century			1
most drinking slang appears to have developed organically , but some is promoted by the actions of governments - for example , since drink - driving was outlawed in @entity231 in 1966 , the phrase ' over the limit ' has been used to describe being drunk			1
professor @entity41 also points out that many words which originally described drinking have over the past few decades mutated and become attached to drug use as well			1
' high ' , ' loaded ' and ' stoned ' all began as alcohol slang , even though now they would more naturally describe someone who had taken narcotics			1
elsewhere in the book the author - one of the world 's greatest experts on the @entity39 language , who is now honorary professor of linguistics at the @entity244 , @entity244 - also follows the development of words for topics such as dying , money , fooling around and going to the toilet			1
the work is based on the @entity252 , which uses the world - famous @entity253 to chart how different words meaning the same thing come into use before falling out of popularity			2
words in @entity260 : exploring language through the @entity42 , by @entity41 , is out now published by @entity262			1
give up the ghost ( @entity39 ) : this phrase dates back to the @entity39 period , when ' gast ' ( ghost ) was commonly used to mean spirit or soul			1
pass ( 1340 ) : to say that someone has ' passed ' is considered sensitive language in @entity273 - it first appeared in the 14th century , and was popularised by @entity142 in @entity274			2
bite the dust ( 1697 ) : this phrase was also rendered as ' bite the ground ' and ' bite the sand ' when it was first used by writers such as @entity280 and @entity281			0
it is based on the image of a soldier falling to the ground during battle			0
snuff out ( 1864 ) : based on the metaphor of extinguishing a candle			0
the phrase , transformed into ' snuff it ' , is now usually used in a casual context			0
meet your maker ( 1933 ) : despite the apparently archaic nature of this phrase , it was first used by @entity222 crime novelist @entity297			0
@entity298 ( 1225 ) : taken from the @entity299 ' privée ' , meaning private place			2
this was for many years the main word used to describe the toilet			1
@entity298 ( 1530s ) : the etymology of this word is unclear , but it may derive from the name @entity307			0
it is now mostly heard in regional dialects			0
water closet ( 1755 ) : a euphemistic term , usually abbreviated to @entity312 , which alludes to the small size of most toilets - comparable to a closet			0
@entity298 ( 1819 ) : originally meant any building outside , but became attached to toilets during the time when they were commonly installed in separate buildings near the main home			2
@entity312 ( 1940 ) : another obscure origin			0
it could be an abbreviation of ' @entity324 ' , or come from the @entity299 ' l'eau ' , as an allusion to ' water '			0
commonly associated with the genteel middle class			0
@entity329 ( 1500 ) : based on an old word for a snail 's shell			0
the horns of a snail were associated with the ' cuckold 's horns ' which denoted a husband whose wife was unfaithful			0
@entity339 ( 1673 ) : the suffix ' poop ' was used as a verb meaning to deceive			0
' @entity343 ' could be a reference to the word ' ninny ' , or it could denote the name ' @entity348 '			0
silly billy ( 1834 ) : this rhyming phrase was often adopted by clowns who ' acted the fool ' alongside a straight man			0
it became attached as a term of abuse to prominent people called @entity29 , most famously @entity357 @entity358 ( 1981 ) : popularised by @entity359 , where main character @entity360 used it as a term of abuse for his sidekick @entity364			2
earlier in the 20th century , the word was a slang term for penis			0
@entity368 ( 1988 ) : possibly an abbreviation of ' numbskull ' , with the ending adapted by analogy with the nursery rhyme @entity374			0
money ( 1325 ) : even though this is by far the most common word today , it did not enter @entity39 until the 14th century			1
in the early days of banknotes , ' money ' was sometimes used to refer only to coins			2
@entity380 ( 1539 ) : a name for the @entity382 in the @entity143			0
it became the personification of greed , and for several centuries was also used to mean money or riches in a more general sense			1

the phrase ' having the mopusses ' is used now in the @entity398 and @entity399			0
@entity400 ( 1851 ) : this ancient word became a slang term for money in the @entity222 during the 19th century , and was then imported into the @entity231 by @entity404 and @entity221			2
@entity405 ( 1943 ) : ' @entity406 ' was cockney rhyming slang for ' drop ' , which referred to money given as a tip.			2
