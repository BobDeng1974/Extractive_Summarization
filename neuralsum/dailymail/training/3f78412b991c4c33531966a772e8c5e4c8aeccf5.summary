by @entity0 they are beautiful images that reveal just how much we have come to rely on sea transport			1
the amazing images show the huge expansion of cargo routes around the world			1
as routes like the @entity11 opened in 1869 , they reveal just how much of the globe is now used to transport goods , with some estimates claiming 90 % of the goods we use have been transported by sea at some point			1
shipping routes from 1980 to 1997 , based on data from the @entity23 , showing the vast number of routes now being used			1
the data was obtained from decades of data from the @entity23 's @entity24			0
once plotted on a map , they create a series of maps that show shipping lanes in black			1
the first map , showing 1784 - 1863 is known as the @entity32 map			0
many of the trips shown are believed to be whaling expiditions			0
an assistant professor of history at @entity38 , @entity36 , created a series of maps that display the worldâ € ™ s modern shipping routes			1
when viewed together , the routes create an inverted map of the world			1
the data was obtained from decades of data from the @entity23 's @entity24			0
once plotted on a map , they create a series of maps that show shipping lanes in black			1
mr @entity36 also says they reveal that governments have long collected data on people 's movements			2
' these data snapshots are fascinating and revealing snapshots of how the state used to and continues to pull in information from the world , ' he said			0
he admits that the data used to create them is incomplete - but says they still show government surveillance has always existed			2
this map is based on shipping routes from the 19th century			2
it shows routes principally around @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68			2
just a few routes , depicted by faint lines , run to @entity71			2
the data was obtained from decades of data from the @entity23 's @entity24			0
many of the earlier trips were whaling expeditions			0
' of course , on the surface , it seems to show 19th century shipping routes : that 's the primary reason it 's interesting			1
' but it 's an obviously incomplete , obviously biased , and obviously fragmentary view of those routes			0
' it 's a relatively complete view , on the other hand , of something more restricted but nearly as interesting : the way that the 19th century @entity88 state was able to see and take measure of the world			1
' no one , today , needs to be told that patterns of state surveillance , data collection , and storage are immensely important			0
' charts like these provide an interesting and important locus for seeing how states ' saw , ' to commandeer a phrase from @entity101			0
' the changes over time can clearly be seen is this collection of images from the collection			0

images show routes recorded by the @entity88 authorities
reveal how changes such as the opening of the @entity114 canal have caused an *explosion* in routes
