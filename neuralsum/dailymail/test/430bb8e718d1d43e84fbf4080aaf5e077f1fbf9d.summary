it 's being billed as the euro - derby in @entity2 and depending on who you support the precedent is either last season 's @entity7 final or the six games that have been played between @entity2 and @entity10 since then			1
in monday 's pre-match press conference almost every question asked to @entity2 coach @entity13 made reference to the fact that in six @entity2 derbies this season @entity2 are yet to win a single game â€“ losing four and drawing two as @entity10 have beaten them twice in the league and in the @entity21 and the @entity22			1
but a remarkably relaxed @entity13 , showing the kind of form in press room that he will hope his players show on the pitch tuesday , reminded everyone that his team did not need to win			0
two draws could see them go through so what was the problem ? he said he did n't see @entity34 's slip on saturday night against @entity35 because he was at the cinema ' enjoying a film ' and when he was asked about @entity10 's threat from set - pieces he responded : ' do n't forget we won the @entity7 with a set - piece last season			1
' @entity2 boss @entity13 says he is not obsessed with @entity10 ahead of tuesday 's clash @entity2 - based papers @entity44 ( left ) and as are looking ahead to the @entity7 quarter - final first leg @entity47 ( centre ) scored an injury - time equaliser for @entity2 as they beat @entity10 4 - 1 aet in the @entity7 final last season at @entity53 's @entity52 in @entity54 however , @entity10 are unbeaten in six @entity2 derbies this term and dumped real out of the @entity22 his reference to @entity47 ' injury - time goal against @entity10 in @entity54 that levelled @entity60 's header and allowed real to run in riot in extra-time will have struck a chord with @entity2 supporters who in the build - up to the game have been busy reminding their rivals that while they may have won none of the last six meetings they did come out on top in the match that mattered more than any other			1
@entity2 are at full strength for the game and that seems to have left @entity13 as upbeat and confident as at any time so far this season			2
he toyed with his @entity79 inquisitors when they questioned him about whether or not @entity80 would start the game			0
the @entity82 was rested at the weekend but will be in the xi on tuesday night			2
' if @entity80 is not 100 percent fit he will not play because we have everyone available ' said @entity13 leaving a pregnant pause			0
but as the possibility that @entity79 favourite @entity88 might start the game presented itself the @entity91 coach added : ' but he is 100 percent			0
' he added : ' @entity80 was fantastic last season but had been really good this season			0
he came good in the big finals scoring in the @entity7 and @entity22 finals so let 's see how he performs now in the final months of the season			2
' @entity80 ( centre ) is set to start for @entity2 after being rested at the weekend against @entity100 on saturday like @entity47 , @entity80 was also on target during @entity2 's @entity7 final success over @entity10 last season the feeling among @entity2 's coaching staff is that while @entity80 has been criticised by the @entity2 press for not being the team player that @entity88 is , his ability to win a big final with a goal or an assist is unmatchable			1
@entity112 added : ' i am not obsessed with @entity10 , ' mentioning ' attitude ' several times in his positive discourse and admitting that was the key missing ingredient from @entity2 's 4 - 0 defeat to @entity10 in february			1
he said facing @entity119 was ' honour and a problem ' and picked out @entity10 's resilience when asked what their greatest quality was			2
' they fight from the first minute to the last , ' he said			0
@entity10 fans believe that fight will see them overcome @entity2 for the seventh time this season and the @entity130 will be full for what , with their title hopes now gone , is their game of the season			1
@entity2 's swagger has been rediscovered though , wth the return of key players @entity47 , @entity139 and @entity140			0
@entity13 recalled the moment @entity140 ' corner was headed in by @entity47 in @entity54			0
' it 's a wonderful memory , ' he said			0
' now we have the challenge of going for @entity2 's 11th @entity7			2
real know they face a stern test against an @entity10 side that beat them 4 - 0 when they last met in february @entity13 hails pitting his wits against @entity10 boss @entity119 as an ' honour and a problem ' the return of midfielder @entity140 ( centre ) from injury has revitalised real in recent weeks			1

@entity10 host @entity2 in their @entity7 quarter - final first leg at the @entity130 on tuesday night
real beat @entity10 4 - 1 aet in the @entity7 final last season
@entity10 are unbeaten in six @entity2 derbies this season against their rivals
