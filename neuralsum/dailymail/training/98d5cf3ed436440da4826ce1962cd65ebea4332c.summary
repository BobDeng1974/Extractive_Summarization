' we took a chance , but we did n’t do it like gambling on a roulette or poker			0
it was calculated , but it was also a calculated risk from our hearts			0
' other rooms are more traditional , including the beautiful @entity141 , which boasts a series of beautifully worked tapestries and delicate apple - green walls			0
equally striking is the kitchen which , along with having classically @entity148 minimalist fittings , includes one wall completely covered by a mural featuring wildlife and flowers painted by @entity3 artist , @entity153			2
