by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 01:57 est , 2 august 2012 @entity1 launched an attack on @entity3 in court yesterday as lawyers for the firm related how @entity1 's entire business was at stake when it launched the @entity9			1
@entity10 , representing @entity1 , painted an evocative picture of @entity1 as a struggling underdog company which knew it would either revolutionise the smartphone market - or die trying			1
he reminded the @entity15 courtroom , in which @entity1 and @entity3 are flinging patents at each other in a bid to prove they did not infringe each others ' inventions , that the mobile market was an entirely different landscape when @entity24 pitched the final designs			1
he said : ' @entity1 had absolutely no name in the field , no credibility			2
[ the @entity9 ] was an entry that - had it gone bad - could have ended the company 's future			0
' on january 9 , 2007 when @entity24 and @entity32 went through that presentation , they were literally betting their company			0
' @entity1 attorney @entity10 questions @entity1 designer @entity35 in this court sketch during the @entity15 trial @entity1 and @entity3 are business partners turned bitter rivals over @entity1 's claims that the @entity42 range infringes on the @entity9 's design			1
@entity3 meanwhile points to pre- 2007 phones to show the ' rectangle touchscreen ' was not a novel look , accusing @entity1 of ' fighting over rectangles '			1
on tuesday afternoon , @entity1 designer @entity35 wrapped up the first day of testimony discussing his role in helping create the company 's @entity9 and @entity51 during his 17 years at the company			1
dressed in a tan suit , the bearded and long haired designer said because of @entity1 's desire to create original products , he and his co-workers surmounted numerous engineering problems such as working with the products ' glass faces in producing both products over a number of years			2
@entity35 said he was upset when he saw @entity3 's @entity42 products enter the market and said : ' we 've been ripped off , it 's plain to see			2
' @entity3 attorney @entity70 demonstrates how rectangular phones with rounded corners ' were not novel before 2007 @entity10 told the jury that @entity3 faced two options to compete in the booming cellphone market after the @entity9 : innovate or copy			1
in his opening statement , he claimed @entity3 chose to copy , making its smartphones and computer tablets illegal knockoffs of @entity1 's popular products - and that @entity3 ' has copied the entire design and user experience ' of the @entity9 and @entity85			1
@entity3 attorney @entity70 countered that the @entity87 company employs thousands of designers and spends billions of dollars on research and development to create new products			1
he said : ' @entity3 is not some copyist , some @entity94 - come - lately doing knockoffs			2
' @entity70 asserted that @entity1 , like many other companies , uses similar technology and designs to satisfy consumer demands for phones and other devices that play music and movies and take photographs			2
for example , he said several other companies and inventors have filed patent applications for the rounded , rectangular shape associated with @entity1 products			1
' everyone is out there with that basic form factor			0
there is nothing wrong with looking at what your competitors do and being inspired by them			0
' the @entity117 and the @entity118 : @entity1 claims @entity3 ripped off their phone with the @entity42 range the trial resumes on friday with the testimony of @entity1 senior vice president for marketing @entity32			1
@entity1 is demanding $ 2.5 billion in damages , an award that would dwarf the largest patent - related verdict to date			2
the case marks the latest skirmish between the two companies over product designs			0
a similar trial began last week , and the two companies have been fighting in other courts in the @entity132 and @entity133			0
@entity3 counter-claims that @entity1 copied its @entity9 from @entity135			1
in addition , @entity3 alleges @entity1 is using some of @entity3 's own inventions without payment , such as a computer chip at the heart of the @entity9			1
@entity3 lawyers also stressed the company has been developing mobile phones since 1991 , long before @entity1 jumped into the market in 2007			1
also at issue at the trial are some of the most basic functions of today 's smartphones and computer tablets , including scrolling with one finger and zooming with a finger tap			0
tuesday morning 's proceedings began with a bit of drama			0
first , a juror pleaded with the judge to be released from the trial , saying she suffered a panic attack and spent a sleepless night after belatedly discovering that her employer would not pay her salary while she served			0
a sympathetic judge granted her request and left the jury with nine members			0
then the judge rebuked @entity166 , one of @entity3 's attorneys , for refusing to stop a line of legal argument the judge said she had ruled on numerous times			2
@entity166 relented and sat down , but his tenacity underscored the high stakes of the trial that is costing both sides millions of dollars in legal fees and expenses			0
battalions of lawyers from prestigious law firms are working overtime to file myriad court documents			0
the most senior lawyers on each side charge upward of $ 500 an hour for their representation legal experts said that most patent disputes are resolved way before trials that can bring unpredictable and ruinous verdicts			0
' a patent case of this magnitude has the possibility of impacting phone technology for years to come , ' said @entity192 , a patent attorney with no stake in the trial			0
' given the substantial revenue that is generated by smartphone technology , companies are likely to prompt more litigation of this type and continue to use the courts as an attempt to protect and expand market share			0

@entity1 lawyer @entity10 paints @entity1 as underdog during opening salvo against @entity3
@entity3 says every company uses the same basic shape of a phone
@entity212 reduced to nine members as juror is *excused* for work *commitments*
