' b * * * * * * s ' : @entity0 , founder of @entity1 , has criticised the @entity3 's £ 1.3billion compensation plan a businessman who amassed a £ 100million fortune through a mis - selling racket showed contempt for his seven million victims yesterday			1
@entity0 – who owns a multi-million - pound home next to @entity10 and has been honoured by the @entity11 for ‘ services to business ’ – is at the centre of a scandal expected to lead to a flood of compensation claims			2
with the help of @entity21 ’s disgraced banking giants , his company misled customers into buying worthless insurance for their credit , debit or store cards			1
but last night , mr @entity0 , who was awarded a cbe by @entity28 in 2011 , was unrepentant			2
asked about the estimated £ 1.3billion compensation payout , he described it as ‘ b * * * * * * * ’ and a ‘ ridiculous figure ’ – and accused the @entity3 of ‘ sensationalism ’			1
the regulator said unwitting customers paid up to £ 84 a year for credit card insurance – even though they would never need it because they were receiving free cover from their bank			1
it condemned mr @entity0 ’s company @entity1 – which he started with just £ 1,000 capital in 1980 – for its central role in the huge mis - selling scandal which will lead to compensation payouts of £ 1.3billion			1
and with breathtaking insensitivity for his victims ’ plight , mr @entity0 remarked that the furore had made him look ‘ a bit of a chump ’			2
following the near collapse of @entity1 , the banks – including the publicly owned @entity52 and @entity53 , now part of @entity55 – have been left to pick up the vast majority of the compensation bill			1
fraud : 13 banks have agreed to pay out billions to customers who were wrongly sold credit card insurance @entity0 receives his cbe from @entity28 in 2011 the embattled business founded by mr @entity0 , a former member of the @entity65 @entity64 , will contribute a paltry sum of £ 29million to the pot. but mr @entity0 – who enjoys a luxurious lifestyle and owns several multi-million pound properties – will face no action over the scandal from which he has amassed his £ 100million fortune			1
experts last night condemned the ‘ scandalous ’ behaviour of the banks , who heartlessly ‘ introduced ’ their customers to @entity1 – and got paid vast sums in commission from @entity1 for the referrals			1
@entity81 , chief executive at citizens advice , said : ‘ yet again banks have shown a complete disregard for their customers by selling them products they did not need			2
' it is a scandalous business model to make money by misleading customers			0
’ the scandal involves 13 financial giants , including @entity21 ’s big banks , such as @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity52 , @entity95 and @entity55 , as well as the country ’s biggest building society @entity96 and credit card firms such as @entity100 and @entity101			2
the net spreads even wider to include @entity103 , one of the high - street ’s best - loved chains			0
its bank is wholly owned by @entity94			0
about 23million useless policies were sold , or renewed , between january 2005 and march 2011 , described by the @entity111 regulator as ‘ widespread mis - selling ’			0
typically , a bank customer would get a new credit card , and a sticker on the card would tell them to call @entity1 to activate the card , or to report that it had arrived safely			0
honour : mr @entity0 is pictured being invested with the @entity27 by @entity28 in 2011 @entity0 founded @entity120 in @entity121 in 1980 in order to provide insurance to credit card users who were concerned about the risk of fraud			1
he developed his entrepreneurial streak when he joined the @entity65 @entity64 aged 17 and sailed around the world , working on building sites and uranium mines in @entity132			0
after attending @entity133 , where he made a name for himself by dealing in cocoa futures , he decided to start his own business rather than look for a job so he could avoid sky - high income tax rates levied by the @entity140 government			0
although @entity1 took nearly a decade to turn a profit , it became enormously successful after he teamed up with more than a dozen banks to offer its services to all their cardholders - many of whom did not know what they were signing up for			1
in an interview in 2000 , mr @entity0 described the firm as ‘ my best investment ’ - and 10 years later , @entity1 , now based in @entity151 , netted him £ 120million when it floated on the stock market			1
in 2011 , he was awarded the cbe for services to business , receiving the honour from the princess royal in a ceremony at @entity11			0
he retained a 57 per cent stake in @entity1 , but the firm ’s fortunes turned sour last year when the @entity162 imposed a fine for the widespread mis - selling of card protection			1
mr @entity0 , a father of three in his mid 60s , launched a bid to buy the company , but after he offered just £ 1.7million the offer was turned down , and he resigned from the board			1
when they phoned @entity1 , aggressive salesmen would coerce the customers into buying the useless insurance policies in tactics described by the regulator as ‘ overly persistent ’			1
salesmen were given targets ‘ for successfully dissuading customers who contacted @entity1 to cancel their policies ’ , the regulator said			1
one former salesman , who did not want to be named , said he left after just one week in the job after being disgusted by the sales tactics			0
speaking to the @entity181 , he said : ‘ it was the most awful , pressurised environment i ’ve ever worked in			0
i ’m not even slightly surprised their products are utterly useless			0
’ while customers were told they would benefit from up to £ 100,000 of insurance cover if their card was defrauded , they were not told they were covered by their bank for free			1
on average , customers paid £ 35 a year for a card protection policy			1
in reality , the @entity3 said the insurance actually cost 60p			1
as a result , @entity1 scooped £ 34.40 from the sale – and paid up to 60 per cent of the money to the bank as a thank - you for the referral of the customer			2
an identity protection policy typically cost £ 84 a year , but the insurance actually cost only £ 16			2
again , @entity1 got £ 68 and gave as much as 50 per cent to the bank			2
@entity204 , from the @entity206 campaign , which wants new financial sector taxes to help tackle poverty , said : ‘ the never - ending stream of dodgy dealings by banks puts your average scam artist to shame			0
it shows they will try any trick to fleece the public			0
’ all victims will be paid compensation , equal to an average of £ 185 each if the bill reaches £ 1.3billion and is shared equally between the seven million victims			0
despite his pivotal role in the scandal , mr @entity0 is one of @entity21 ’s richest men , after pocketing £ 120million from selling a large chunk of shares when @entity1 floated on the stock market in 2010			1
widespread : as many as 14 banks are said to have been involved in the insurance scam controversy : the scandal centres around banks ' links with the finance company @entity1 he still controls 57 per cent of the business , although the share price has imploded			1
mr @entity0 continues to enjoy the trappings of wealth , with several properties , including a £ 4.5 million mansion in @entity241 and an imposing townhouse in @entity121 ’s @entity243			2
@entity244 , founder of consumer finance website @entity246 , said it is ‘ thoroughly depressing ’ to see another case of banks ripping off their customers			2
he added : ‘ by asking loyal customers to pay for policies that were essentially worthless , it is no wonder levels of trust in the high - street banks is at absolute rock bottom			2
