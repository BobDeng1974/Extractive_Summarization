by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 16:30 est , 15 september 2013 @entity2 's @entity1 and @entity3 have never had a shortage of stars decorating their front row but now it seems the designers have decorating them in their sights			0
for this was a collection that screamed old - school @entity12 glamour , awash with starlet scarlet and frocks that practically demanded a red carpet			1
gone were the pop prints and candy colours and in their place were magical chiffon gowns for grown - ups ( were you watching @entity23 ? ) as well as neat nipped in dresses that barely touched the tops of models ' thighs and are a dead cert for the red carpet at next year 's @entity30			1
this time around , there were @entity49 pop art florals given a touch of @entity52 grit by being set against gothic black			2
they were splashed over tiny dresses , on neatly wearable @entity57 skirts and all over the skirt of a fabulous gown , slashed to the thigh and given drama with flamenco - style ruffles			2
there were even a few polka dots , although unlike in seasons past , these were subtle and barely registered			0
but although the tropical print florals caught the eye , it was the jewel - coloured frocks in shiny silky purple , chiffon cadmium yellow and devilish crimson that were the real winners on the night			2
low key : for once , prints did n't take centre stage gothic : the @entity2 duo plumped for a distinctly wintry palette @entity80 n ' roll : separates were few and far between detail : vast flamenco style ruffles gave minidresses a modern edge , as did sheer chiffon and clean lines star - studded : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 look on during the show kept modern with puffed hemlines , vast flamenco style ruffles and the odd discreet sheer panel , this was a master class in the art of dressmaking			1
separates were few and far between but this was one collection where it did n't really matter - certainly not to the a-listers looking on			2
sitting watching the gowns go by was , as is usually the case with @entity2 , a veritable galaxy of stars , among them singer @entity93 , a puff - ball skirted @entity112 and @entity113 actor @entity90			1
but stellar though the front row was , the really out - of - this - world sight on offer were the clothes themselves			0
grown - up , glamorous and very , very well executed , this was a collection teed up to impress the celebrities front row - and it deserves to succeed			1
taking her inspiration from the deadly @entity128 flower , @entity125 makeup artist @entity124 created a striking beauty look for @entity2 this season			0
she started by blending vivid purple cream eyeshadow over the eyelids of her models and then added a strong statement brow ( @entity136 inspired , anyone ? )			0
using the new @entity139 mascara is , she gave the girls a gothic lash look and slicked a thick line of eyeliner over their lids too			0
she coated lips with a dark shade of plum ( @entity125 's @entity149 # 338 ) , before using a soft makeup brush to rub the colour into a velvety finish , a look we have spotted everywhere so far			0
the beautiful shades of mauve and indigo came together for a romantic , gothic s / s14 make - up look - time to start playing with purple ! special thanks to @entity160 and @entity161 for driving the @entity163 team round during @entity164			1
