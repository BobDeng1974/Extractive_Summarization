by @entity0 cycling on city streets can be a harrowing experience , even for the most experienced of riders			0
to address the problem , @entity4 has launched a prototype bike that fuses traditional cycling design with modern safety features			2
the @entity14 ’ comes complete with gps , rear - view camera , a curved frame , a live video feed and even its own laser beams			1
lasers projects a virtual lane on to the road to make sure motorists keep a safe distance away from the bike four lasers project a virtual lane on to the road to make sure motorists keep a safe distance away from the bike			0
the bike can turn on the lane markers automatically , using an ambient light sensor that can tell when it is getting dark			0
additionally , a gps system tracks people ’s daily routes and lets local authorities know which ones should be turned into real bike - lanes			1
at the front of the frame is a magnetic smartphone mount that lets riders connect the bike to their phone to track distance , speed and direction a rear - view camera allows cyclists to keep an eye on traffic as it approaches from behind , with video streamed to the bike - mounted smartphone lasers project a virtual lane on to the road to make sure motorists keep a safe distance from the cyclist			1

@entity4 , along with collaborators @entity100 and @entity102 , introduced the prototype for its @entity14 at a design trade show in @entity105 earlier this year			2
the group has been working on a concept bike as part of its @entity109 , which was co-founded with designer @entity111 ’s @entity105 office			1

according to the @entity128 , cyclists now account for five per cent of all road traffic deaths in the world			0
while the @entity4 bike is currently a concept design , with no plans for sale , others are working on making their versions of a smart bike a reality			2
for instance , the @entity140 @entity139 smartbike offers turn - by - turn navigation by using low energy bluetooth to connect to a smartphone for directions			0
the bike also has a blind - spot detector to alert a rider to potential danger by vibrating the handlebars			0
designer @entity151 , who has launched a @entity153 campaign to commercialise the bike , said it will get cleverer over time by learning to avoid potholes and suggesting safer routes .			0

@entity4 teamed up with @entity111 ’s @entity105 office to create the prototype
design *includes* gps , rear - view camera , a curved frame and live video feed
magnetic mount on handlebars lets riders connect the bike to a phone
@entity163 tracks routes and lets authorities know where bike lanes are needed
design is still a concept , and @entity4 has no plans to sell the bike
