@entity0 has galloped into retirement with trainer @entity2 describing him as the best colt he has ever trained			1
plans for the four - time group one winner to have one final run in either the @entity9 at @entity10 on october 18 or in the @entity11 ’ @entity12 on november 1 have been shelved because of ongoing treatment for a throat infection			1
it scuppers of a possible dream showdown between @entity0 and dual @entity19 winner @entity17 in the @entity20			2
@entity0 ridden by @entity21 breaks away to win the @entity22 on day one of @entity10 @entity2 , who trained @entity0 , has described the colt as the best he has ever worked with @entity2 , who had previously insisted his champion miler had the gears to dominate the sprint division , said : ‘ he had a turbo charge that no other horse i 've trained has possessed			1
he 's the most exciting horse i 've trained			0
‘ i trained @entity30 to win at the @entity31 in a record time , and she was very good , but this boy would be in a different league			0
’ @entity0 ’s absence from the @entity20 could also have a significant bearing on the trainer ’s title race			1
@entity2 leads @entity40 by over £ 250,000 and would have hoped to collect around £ 600,000 from a first place at @entity10 with @entity0			1
in the absence of the @entity44 - owned colt , @entity40 will have the prize in his sights , perming his attack from a squad of @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
it was @entity49 who inflicted the only defeat on @entity0 in six races this year when beating him half a length in the @entity57 at @entity58 in may			0
@entity0 , ridden by @entity21 wins the group one @entity59 at @entity61 @entity21 ( pink cap , right ) riding @entity0 wins the @entity63 at @entity64 @entity2 could n’t hide his frustration at the unsatisfactory result of a @entity67 turned into a tactical nightmare when the field split into two packs racing on either side of the @entity58			2
if anyone doubted whether @entity21 - ridden @entity0 , who won seven of his eight career starts and £ 970,834 , was the best miler of his generation , they were handed emphatic evidence when he romped to a five - length win in the @entity80 and then avenged his @entity58 reverse by beating @entity49 two - and - a - quarter lengths in the @entity22 at @entity10			2
but arguably he was at his most visually impressive when leaving 2013 winner @entity51 for dead in a slowly - run @entity59 which turned into a two - furlong burn - up			0
@entity0 will stand at his owner ’s @entity84 alongside @entity86 .			0

@entity0 was planned to have one final run in either the @entity9 at @entity10 on october 18 or in the @entity11 ’ @entity12
