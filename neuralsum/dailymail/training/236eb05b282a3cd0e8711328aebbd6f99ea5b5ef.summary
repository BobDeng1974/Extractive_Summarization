by @entity0 many of these vehicles helped seal @entity4 victory for @entity5 , including on the beaches of @entity7 , but today they rest in a ' vehicle graveyard ' on a former @entity10 base left untouched since 1963			1
the closed military site at @entity12 in @entity13 is home to an ageing collection of decommissioned military vehicles , farming machinery and lorries dating from the 1940s , which aided the war effort here and in occupied @entity22			1
the hulking machines are parked in line , falling apart and forgotten , at the edge of the 6,000ft - long runway , some swallowed up by bushes and trees			1
rusting legend : this @entity32 vehicle , which was used during the d - day landings , produced between 1942 and 1945 , and used by the @entity34 up into the 1970s , sits at the closed military site at @entity12 in @entity13 left to rot : this military - used @entity37 tractor stands on the spot where it was dumped at a former @entity10 base left untouched for at least 50 years frozen : these ageing vehicles , some of which helped with the war effort , lay still lined up along the @entity13 runway kept for scrap : this wartime fuel pump engine has been stored at the former @entity10 site so that spare parts can be sold off urban explorer @entity51 , 36 , photographed the strange collection of derelict automobiles			1
he said : ' it is quite eerie - the vehicles were stretched along the runway for as far as i could see			1
i could n't even see the end of the line			2
' seeing all those old trucks and tractors lined up next to each other in the middle of the countryside is bizarre			2
' it is in the middle of nowhere and it was very cold			2
i was n't sure i was supposed to be there so i was very careful not to disturb the vehicles			2
' forgotten : this disused crane stands among hundreds of other abandoned machines used by the forces up until 1963 taken by nature : this bulldozer has been swallowed up by a bush while plants have grown in its tracks over the decades it has lay there untouched lost in the undergrowth : this military truck , a @entity83 , lies among the collection of decommissioned military vehicles , farming machinery and lorries mothballed : this truck , fitted with caterpillar tracks , stands rusting next to a pile of other equipment at @entity12 destroyed : this pan scraper , a piece of agricultural machinery often used for the removal of earth , sand or in mines , lies decaying in the woods around the abandoned @entity12 out of service : a disused caterpillar tractor previously used in agricultural work , stands alone surrounded by abandoned parts on empty : these fuel gauges from a military vehicle are well preserved despite being left untouched for at least 50 years in rural @entity13 @entity12 , 30 miles south of @entity106 , had a 23 - year life at the heart of the second world war effort and later the @entity110			1
when it opened in 1940 , it was used as a dummy airfield , with fake planes and personnel , set up to draw the @entity114 away from @entity115 , just a mile away			2
later it was brought into use by the @entity10 and the @entity117 , primarily as a home for airborne units			0
soldiers were dropped into @entity121 in 1944 and later on @entity122 by parachute			0
after the war , it was a ballistic missile base , with weapons fuelled and ready to fire during the @entity127 in november 1962			0
but within a year it was closed and is now in private hands			0
the runway is home to several decommissioned @entity4 vehicles including a dukw amphibious truck - the model which was used during the d - day landings - as well as mobile pump engines and various military trucks			1
other pieces of agricultural machinery which litter the landscape include tractors , bulldozers , jcbs and earth - movers			0
bizarrely , mr @entity51 , from @entity146 , spotted the severed heads of two deers rotting inside an abandoned crane			0
' i saw the antlers poking out of the crane and when i went for a closer look i saw two deer heads in there			0
one was on the drivers seat and the other was at the back of the cab , ' he said			0
' they ca n't have been there long , they were still quite intact			0
' i have no idea why they were there , or how they got there			0
' @entity12 opened in 1940			1
during @entity4 it was used as an airfield for airborne units in the @entity10 and the @entity170			1
the airfield was eventually sold off in august 1963 for agricultural use			2
today the remains of the airfield are located on private property			0
the main runway is used as hardstanding for hundreds of scrap vehicles			1
the vehicles are all owned by @entity179 who store the decommissioned vehicles for sale of the spare parts			0
dramatic : set in the flat @entity13 countryside , perfect for airfields , @entity12 has hundreds of vehicles , lined up next to eachother , along its long runway history : @entity12 pictured left in may 1944 , with the ends of runways numbered in this aerial from the time , and right , the mothballed airfield today strategic : known as bomber country , @entity13 was covered in @entity10 bases , and @entity198 for much of the war was used as a decoy for a base a mile away towards @entity202			1

@entity12 in @entity13 was used in @entity4 and the @entity110 before being shut down in 1963
its main north / south runway is lined with hundreds of military and other machines , known as the ' vehicle graveyard '
