by @entity0 published : 14:14 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 12:58 est , 8 march 2014 sacrifices : @entity3 , 82 , in the wheelchair , who was today handed back his inheritance after his aunt decided to give it all to her window cleaner a elderly man who lost out on £ 300,000 after his ' curmudgeonly ' aunt left her entire fortune to a window cleaner has been handed back his inheritance by a judge			1
@entity3 was at @entity15 's ' beck and call ' after he gave up work to look after her in 1996 , the @entity18			1
he ran errands and organised her affairs as the increasingly capricious pensioner ' called the shots ' around her home until she finally shut him out and changed her will			2
now , after a judge reversed mrs @entity15 's final will and testament , the window cleaner to whom she left her worldly possessions must pay it all back all back			0
mr @entity3 , now 82 , had taken a retirement job as a driver , said judge @entity33 , but he resigned to ' dedicate more time ' to looking after her his aunt which became ' almost a full - time job '			1
' in return she told him she would ‘ compensate ’ him by leaving him her bungalow in her will , ' the judge explained			0
' from that point onwards mr @entity3 was effectively at her beck and call			1
' mrs @entity15 drew up a will in 2003 which left the bulk of her cash and her home in @entity49 , @entity50 , to her nephew - with the estate in total valued at more than £ 300,000			0
but following a series of falls in 2005 she underwent a major personality change , after which mr @entity3 was ' excommunicated from her life '			1
he was ' ordered out of her house ' , he told the court , soon after meeting her window cleaner , @entity62 , at her home in july of that year			0
he had no memory of a previous meeting , said the judge , who added that ' any previous encounter with mr @entity62 would have been as his aunt ’s window cleaner '			0
from that point onward , mr @entity62 , himself now 80 , became an increasingly important figure in mrs @entity15 ’s life			2
mr @entity3 , meanwhile , was forced to recede into the background by his own failing health			2
although for many years he had thought of himself as her ' favourite nephew ' , his close family ' urged him to avoid contact with her due to the stress involved '			0
when she died in 2008 , aged 98 , she left mr @entity62 everything			0
mrs @entity15 was described in court as a ' fiercely independent and indeed difficult woman ' , but with a great love of animals and enduring @entity84 faith			0
' mr @entity3 reckoned that , at any one time , she had only been on speaking terms with 10 to 15 percent of her family , ' said the judge			2
the case reached court as mr @entity3 , who came out of hospital in a wheelchair to testify , challenged the validity of his aunt ’s last three wills			1
his barrister , @entity95 , claimed mrs @entity15 lacked the required ' testamentary capacity ' to execute the series of disputed wills , the last of which she signed the year before she died			0
it was also mr @entity3 ’s case that mr @entity62 , mrs @entity15 's sole beneficiary , ' procured the wills by undue influence ' - a claim which the judge ultimately rejected			1
out of luck : window cleaner @entity62 , who was the sole beneficiary of @entity15 's final will , must now pay mr @entity3 back the entire £ 300,000 legacy after a judge ruled she should have kept her earlier promises mr @entity62 insisted he had never been interested in mrs @entity15 ’s money and that he had always done his best to care for her			1
there was no evidence of ' coercion ' on the window cleaner ’s part , said the judge , who also rejected claims that mr @entity62 was ' cavalier ' in his care of mrs @entity15 in the last months of her life			2
however , he ruled that mrs @entity15 had ' expressly agreed ' that she would leave her house to mr @entity3 when she died and , given all her nephew had done for her , it was right to hold her to her promise			1
stripping mr @entity62 of his inheritance , judge @entity124 ruled mrs @entity15 lacked the mental capacity to make all of her final three wills and found in favour of the 2003 document , which left mr @entity3 all but £ 14,000 of her estate			1
' mr @entity62 will now have to repay all he has received from mrs @entity15 ’s estate , ' the judge concluded .			0

@entity3 gave up his job to look after his elderly aunt @entity15
in return she promised her home and money when she died
but after a fall she changed character and shut mr @entity3 out of her life
