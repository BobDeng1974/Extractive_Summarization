by @entity0 @entity1 is being criticized after allowing users of its @entity4 cellphone to download a game called @entity7			1
the sickening title sees players earning points by ' dropping bombs and avoid killing citizens '			0
the app , which has been available since the last week of july has been downloaded at least 1,000 times with a few people flagging the game as ' inappropriate			1
' as of last night , the game does not appear to be any longer available on @entity16			2
bomb @entity7 : the game was developed for @entity4 phones and was downloaded roughly 1,000 times before it was withdrawn following complaints withdrawn : an extremely insensitive app has landed the @entity20 at the center of a controversy over what it allows to be sold the game is described as via a series of screenshots			1
users score points by controlling aircraft marked with @entity31 flags as they drop bombs on cartoon @entity34 militants			2
so far , @entity16 has not commented on the outrage , though a current search through the store reveals that it seems to have disappeared from the catalog			2
@entity16 is notoriously more tolerant than @entity41 in what it allows developers to sell in its store , however @entity1 ’s @entity46 document , it notes under a subsection titled @entity48 and bullying that ' depictions of gratuitous violence are not allowed , ' and that ' apps should not contain materials that threaten , harass or bully other users			1
' under another titled @entity54 , @entity1 writes ' we do n’t allow content advocating against groups of people based on their race or ethnic origin , religion , disability , gender , age , veteran status , or sexual orientation / gender identity			0
' the aim of the game is to ' drop bombs and avoid killing civilians '			0
it shows a plan continuously flying over a cartoon version of @entity7 , while trying to avoid rockets the policy guidelines show that though the store does n't allow spam or ' most nudity , ' it does n't have any explicitly stated rules on offensive content or violence			1
' @entity7 ' is not the only app that deals with the @entity86 - @entity31 conflict			1
there are a number of other that follow a similar theme which are still available in the app store including @entity91 , a missile - defense game , and @entity93 , which tells users it is a charity game for @entity7 that encourages users to donate money			1
the game ’s dismissal comes just as @entity31 says it ’s pulling out of @entity7 in observance of a three - day ceasefire , on the heels of a month - long fight that has to date left nearly 1,900 palestinians and 67 @entity31 dead			1
comments in the game 's review section expressed anger and bewilderment that real human suffering could be made into a game			0
real people , many of them children , are dying in @entity7			0
many of those who have n’t been killed face life with debilitating injuries , bereavement and without homes			0
their suffering is as real as yours or mine , and to make light of it like this speaks of your essential failure as a human			0
shame on the creators of this game , and those who ‘ play ’ it , ' read one comment by user @entity129			0
another comment on the @entity132 page read : ' this is sick			0
you should be ashamed to have created such an app. do you really think it 's a game ? ' the app 's withdrawal comes just as the latest ceasefire between @entity31 and @entity34 took effect .			2
