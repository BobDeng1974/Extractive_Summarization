the episode , which had an average of 8.4m viewers , also had more successful ratings than last saturday night 's @entity29 show - proving just why it will be moving to @entity23 next year			1
but she said it had been hard to keep her win under wraps for so long following the pre-recorded last episode			1
' i 've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face , ' @entity6 said			2
' i remember watching the @entity64 final the following week and getting so emotional ... and thinking at least @entity65 does n't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months			1
competitors : @entity47 and @entity49 pose with @entity1 , @entity9 and @entity10 the final three : @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity1 enjoy an embrace for they begin their final challenges ' i 'm looking forward to being able to celebrate with my incredibly close family and friends			1
' @entity6 dismissed reports about chemistry between @entity76 and @entity9 , who was crowned star baker three times , saying : ' we were not thinking about any of that in there ... there was no flirtation			1
' but she admitted there was some flirtation elsewhere in the @entity2 tent			2
' we [ the contestants ] were each flirting with each other if we needed to , for more parchment paper or another spoon if they were still being washed up out the back , ' she admitted			2
@entity95 shot : @entity1 posed up with @entity47 and @entity49 and her all important reward now @entity6 said that her next quest is to find herself the perfect man - with one specific attribute			1
she told @entity100 : ' whoever he may be , i hope he will have a healthy appetite			2
someone who is 6ft would be good ! ' @entity1 added : ' being on the show has not quite been blind date to baking date			1
' but @entity1 also revealed that her future partner will have to get used to some of her own unique personality traits			1
she told the mirror : ' i know i ’m random and slightly eccentric			2
but if i can bring that eclectic mix of things into the kitchen , into the bowl , then so be it			2
' the time has come : @entity47 and @entity49 had a hard task ahead of them as the show kicked off nervous : @entity1 struggled with nerves as the first task started result : @entity1 impressed the judges when she presented a rainbow picnic pie in the first challenge @entity6 , who decorated her wedding cake with edible confetti made from beetroot , mango , rhubarb and sweet potato , said she had a rest from baking after winning the show			1
' i thought my blood sugar levels would go through the roof			2
i had a bit of a sabbatical , ' she @entity139 has been approached by agents and wants to produce a coffee table book			2
' i do n't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me , ' she said			2
' what i 'd love to do is combine both passions , baking and design			2
let 's go : @entity10 made a chicken and pig pie for the first challenge reflective : as per usual @entity9 was n't particularly confident about her skills support : @entity9 found she had @entity156 on hand for support during the first challenge rare smile : @entity9 relaxed a little bit when she realised she had managed to create layers ' the baking market is completely saturated so i do n't want to do a book that 's anything like one that 's already out there			1
i 'd like to create a book that 's got all my rough sketches and ideas			1
' @entity6 , who lives in @entity170 , @entity171 , said she was not considering leaving her design job any time yet - but any extra cash on the back of her success will go down well			1
' i 'd start to get a bit more furniture in my house			0
the kitchen looks very well stocked but the rest of the house , not so much , ' she said			0
' but forget millionaires , it 's going to be about creating more millionaire shortbreads			1
falling short : @entity1 came last in the technical challenge with some disappointing sweet and savoury pretzels winner : @entity10 impressed with her pretzel and won the second challenge struggle : @entity9 complained that she could n't remember what a pretzel looked like ' work has been so , so supportive			1
i 'm not going to say yea or nay to anything at the moment			0
i 've got a mortgage to pay			0

' i do n't think i could speak for a little while			0
it was complete and utter shock			0
it was so close , such a close final , ' she said			1
' i think it was the wedding cake at the end that really did swing it			1
' not enough : @entity9 's wedding cake was lacking in the flavour it needed presentation : @entity10 was let down with the decoration on her wedding cake upset : @entity9 once again breaks down in tears after her cake is n't quite the success she hoped off : @entity47 told @entity9 that the colours of her cake did n't quite work @entity6 , who had been criticised by the judges for style over substance , said she was persuaded to apply for @entity232 off by family and friends			1
she added : ' i had thought of applying			0
but it was just , i did n't know whether i was good enough or whether i wanted that exposure			0
i did n't know whether i should go about it in my own way			0
' she insisted there was no antagonism between the all - women finalists			1
' we all get on			0
people want to feel there was more competition than was the case			0
the emotions you go through in that tent , you never want to see anyone get that criticism			0
outside the tent we 're just supportive of each other			0
