scientists have revealed a groundbreaking 3d map of @entity3 ice sheet allowing them to look back in time			1
using ice - penetrating radar data collected by @entity7 's @entity6 , the project allows scientists to determine the age of large swaths of the second largest mass of ice on @entity13			1
they say it could also help predict the future for the sheet , an area containing enough water to raise ocean levels by about 20 feet			0

using radars researchers have been able to look inside it			0
the @entity31 radar transmits signals into the ice and records the strength and time the reflected signals return			0
they can detect the visible layers in ice that one would read if they were to take an ice core			0
instead of only being able to measure one area , however , it can measure large swaths of the ice sheet			2
@entity31 stands for the @entity45 of @entity46			0
the map gives scientists a better picture of the ice sheet 's history			1
scientists can now determine the age of large swaths of the ice sheet and see how the sheet evolved			1
@entity3 's ice sheet has been losing mass over the past 20 years due to warming temperatures			1
scientists are studying the ice during different climate periods so they can better predict how the ice sheet will respond in the future			2
' this new , huge data volume records how the ice sheet evolved and how it 's flowing today , ' said @entity66 , the study 's lead author , a glaciologist at the @entity68			1
the ice - penetrating radar , called @entity31 radar , has the ability to detect the visible layers in ice that one would read in ice cores			1
the radar transmits signals into the ice and records the strength and time the reflected signals return			0
using this information , researchers were able to determine where the ice surface , sub-ice bedrock , and layers within the ice are			0
ice cores show past snow accumulation and temperatures			0
they also contain impurities such as dust and volcanic ash , which would have been carried in by the snow			0
the information in ice cores was accumulated and compacted over a period of hundreds of thousands of years			0
prior to using the @entity31 radar , researchers were unable to make maps on such a large scale			0
the researchers also used the data collected from @entity6 's aerial missions , which included flights across the ice sheet that covered tens of thousands of kilometers			1
@entity6 's aerial measurements often intersected areas where researchers already mapped and dated the layers using ice cores			2
the core data provided by those sites provided reference points for the radar measurements recently collected			2
scientists are interested learning about the ice from the @entity115 period , which was 115,000 to 130,000 years ago , because the temperatures then were about as warm as today 's			2
the new data provides the first data - based estimate of where ice from that period lies within the sheet			2
the ice - penetrating radar , called @entity31 radar , has the ability to detect the visible layers in ice that one would read in ice cores			1
comparing this age volume to simple computer models helped the study 's team better understand the ice sheet 's history			1
differences in the mapped and modeled age volumes point to past changes in ice flow or processes such as melting at the ice sheet 's base			1
this information will be helpful for evaluating the more sophisticated ice sheet models that are crucial for projecting @entity3 's future contribution to sea - level rise			1
' prior to this study , a good ice - sheet model was one that got its present thickness and surface speed right			2
' now , they 'll also be able to work on getting its history right , which is important because ice sheets have very long memories , ' said @entity66 .			0
