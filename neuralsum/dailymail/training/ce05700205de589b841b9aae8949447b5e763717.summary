@entity1 manager @entity0 has attacked @entity4 ’s @entity3 rules that have allowed @entity5 to have an easier draw in this season ’s competition than his own team			1
@entity0 considers it unfair to be facing tournament favourites @entity11 in their group for the third time in four seasons despite winning the @entity15 while fourth - place @entity5 , who had to come through a qualifying tie to reach the group stage , were classified as top seeds and are odds - on to qualify past @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
current @entity3 seedings depend on previous results in the tournament rather than how they did in their domestic league which favours traditionally strong clubs like @entity5 rather than an emerging force such as @entity1			2
city have failed to progress beyond the last - 16 in three attempts following tough draws which have seen them paired with the likes of @entity11 and @entity34 and @entity0 , whose side play their first group game of this season ’s tournament in @entity11 ’s @entity39 on wednesday night , thinks it is time to reward teams for becoming @entity15 champions			1
‘ in our group we have three domestic champions , the @entity59 champions , the @entity61 champions , and the @entity63 champions ( @entity62 )			2
so our group seems a bit unbalanced			0
‘ maybe in the future there will be a system for the teams in the pots which goes according to their position in their leagues and the points won in @entity74			0
‘ i think we need to find a modification whereby , for example , all teams who play qualification go into pot four , and all champions of their respective leagues and have a lot of points in @entity74 ( a high coefficient ) go into pot one			0
‘ there is a need for some modifications to not let something like what happened to us happen again , while the teams that play preliminaries appear to be the most important ones in @entity74			0
@entity5 and @entity1 drew 2 - 2 in their @entity15 clash on saturday at the emirates @entity1 have failed to seriously challenge for the @entity3 so far in their short history ‘ i think that the champions of @entity59 and the champions of the @entity61 league , with both leagues being among the best leagues in @entity74 , they deserve to be in pot one			1
’ ironically , @entity1 and @entity5 faced each other in the @entity15 on saturday			1
@entity0 was hired by @entity1 to replace @entity106 at the start of last season because of his @entity3 success with @entity110 who he took to the quarter - finals in 2013			1
he managed to take @entity1 into the knockout stages for the first time in their history but were eliminated by @entity116 in the last - 16 after finishing runners - up in their group to @entity11			2
he now faces another tough task against @entity11 , @entity62 and @entity121 runners - up @entity122 , who include @entity124 , but hopes last season ’s run will help			1
‘ the fact of having qualified for the knockout stages having been in the toughest group increases the confidence of the players for this season and the future			2
i hope , but you never know of course , that we will see a more mature @entity1 in the @entity3 , and a @entity1 that will try to do better than the year before			0
@entity5 scraped past @entity138 in a play - off after finishing fourth in the @entity15 last season ‘ our win in @entity141 and the close tie against @entity116 when we had 10 men has given us extra confidence			1
’ while @entity34 boast @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 , and @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , @entity0 has his own @entity151 ready to explode			0
‘ i think that @entity152 is among the best players in the world and i think it is now up to him to make it and fight for the @entity157 ´ or as best player , because he has all the qualities you can ask of a football player , ’ he said			0
‘ he is technically very strong , he is fast and has a lot of power			0
he is very intelligent , able to play in his position in between midfield and attack			0
and so we hope to see @entity152 back in the form he demonstrated in the @entity15 before his injuries hit him , and i think that he will make a difference this season			2
