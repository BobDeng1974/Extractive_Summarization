when widowed @entity1 moved into a new home , she set about transforming a boggy wasteland into a pretty garden with a pond , shrubs and flowers			1
it soon became a haven for wildlife , populated by frogs , newts , birds and insect life			1
the labour of love took several years and cost the best part of £ 10,000 , but was worth every penny to mrs @entity1 , 74 , who looked on it as a memorial to her husband , a keen gardener , who had died of cancer			2
devastated : @entity1 breached greenbelt planning regulations when she created her landscape garden nature : the garden is home to fish , frogs , newts , birds , insects and a variety of plant life determined : the grandmother said she would rather go to prison then lose her ' pride and joy ' now she is facing heartbreak , as council officials have ordered her to tear up the garden , and return part of it to the muddy state she found it in			1
ironically , their reason is that she has developed part of the garden on greenbelt land			0
the work was done without planning permission and , say officials , it ‘ erodes the character and quality of the area ’ in @entity54 , @entity55			1
‘ you must return the land to agricultural use and character , removing all garden paraphernalia , ’ they have told her			1
the retired florist has been warned that if she does not comply , council workmen will do the work and she will face a hefty bill			0
expense : the pensioner spent around £ 10,000 creating her ' pride and joy ' in @entity54 , @entity55 extra : the land the garden was built on was bought by mrs @entity1 's daughter along with their house threats : the council have told mrs @entity1 she faces legal action unless the land is returned to ' agricultural use ' the issue dates back to 2006 when mrs @entity1 ’s daughter and son - in - law bought the cottage and she moved into a granny flat extension			1
as part of the deal , the sellers threw in an adjoining plot to create a bigger garden			0
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ if i knew it was greenbelt land i would not have built on it			0
‘ but these greenbelt laws are there for a reason : to protect against big developments and safeguard wildlife			0
‘ i ’m protecting wildlife with my little pond and i ’ve used up 10ft of greenbelt land which was an eyesore before			0
room with a view : a view of the field from mrs @entity1 's home before the landscape gardeners arrived on site costly : the council said it will send its own workers to do the job and leave mrs @entity1 with the bill ' it ’s really upset me			2
the garden reminds me of my husband , @entity120 , who died in 1994 – it acts as a memorial to him			2
‘ it is my pride and joy and i would rather go to prison than lose it			2
’ councillor @entity128 , the cabinet member for planning at @entity130 , said : ‘ planning requirements have to be obeyed			0
‘ no special circumstances exist to justify what has to be considered to be inappropriate development within the greenbelt			0
’ bureaucracy : letter sent to mrs @entity1 from the council , right , and the field before its was developed , left ' mr life ' : mrs @entity1 said the garden is a tribute to her late husband , @entity120 , who died of cancer in 1994			1

@entity1 , 74 , *dedicated* the landscape garden to her late husband @entity120
she said she would rather go to prison than lose her ' pride and joy '
@entity154 ordered her to return to the land it its *original* ' agricultural use '
planning *bosses* said it ' erodes the character and quality of the area '
the garden is home to fish , newts , frogs , insects , birds and plant life
the family claim they were *unaware* they were breaching planning rules
