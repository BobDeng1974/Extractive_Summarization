by @entity0 a @entity2 school teacher who set his heart on living in @entity4 has found a way to maximize the space inside his tiny studio apartment by thinking inside the box – and the finished result is now up for sale			1
in 2005 , @entity11 , a third - grade teacher at @entity12 , bought a 450 - square - foot unit with a tiny kitchen on the @entity15 for $ 235,000			1
‘ it was basically an open rectangular space , ’ @entity11 recalled in an interview with the site @entity18			0
‘ there was n't much to it , there was just a couple of old closets , an old corner kitchen and that was it			0
that is when he turned to the team of architects @entity51 and @entity52 , of @entity53 , commissioning them to come up with a creative solution that would maximize his very limited space			0
‘ initially we were looking at different ways we could subdivide the spaces into smaller spaces , ’ said @entity51 , ‘ but pretty quickly it became clear that there was n't really enough room to get like a real bedroom in here and if you did then there was n't really room to have a real living room area			2
’ @entity51 and @entity52 came up with a 4 - in - 1 box that would serve as a bedroom , a living room , an office and a closet throughout the day			1
the unit and its many uses have been captured by photographer @entity77			0
the cabinet featuring chemistry - lab countertops , @entity81 panels and medium - density fiberboard took a year to complete and cost @entity11 $ 70,000			1
transformer : the space can be simultaneous a home office and a bedroom hidden behind a strategically placed panel providing privacy all in one : this diagram of the @entity4 studio 's floor plan shows all the uses of the cabinet party down : the box can been completely closed , with a small panel on the side used as a bar when the homeowner has people over gourmet kitchen : the miniscule apartment features an under - the - counter fridge and a half - width gas range no inch wasted : the island separating the living room / bedroom / office from the kitchen doubles as a dining table comfortably sitting three @entity11 said he embraced the idea of downsizing and living a simpler , more stripped - down life			1
‘ i get overwhelmed by too much [ stuff ] , ’ he said with a chuckle			0
on the outside , the large blue structure the architects had erected in the middle of @entity11 ’s micro-apartment appears bulky and unwieldy , but looks can be deceiving			0
the ‘ magic cabinet ’ contains a full - size @entity39 , complete with a nightstand and lighting hidden behind a cabinet door , which then serves as a wall separating the sleeping quarters from the rest of the house			2
by pulling out a few inexpensive panels , @entity11 can turn his bedroom into a work space with a small library , a relatively private guest room , or a living room			1
if the homeowner wants to entertain , the box can be closed up completely , with only a small flip - down panel on the side used as a bar			0
moving on up : the unfolding apartment is now on the market for listing price of $ 469,000 the team of architects dubbed their multipurpose cabinet ' the unfolding apartment , ’ but @entity11 , who spent a year living in @entity145 , lovingly refers to it as the ‘ origami apartment			1
’ after a decade folding and unfolding the versatile box , @entity11 put his unit on the market this month for $ 469,000 , the real estate site @entity149 reported			2
beside the central structure , the unit boasts a small kitchen with a half - width @entity156 gas range and a compact below - the - counter refrigerator .			0
