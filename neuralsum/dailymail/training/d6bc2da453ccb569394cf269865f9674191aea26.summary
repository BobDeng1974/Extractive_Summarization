by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 12 august 2013 a rodeo clown who dressed as @entity3 and asked the crowd if they wanted to see the president ' run down by a bull ' was today banned from the @entity9 for life			1
the unnamed stuntman was widely criticized by @entity13 and @entity14 officials after the controversial act on saturday			1
the clown wo n't be allowed to participate or perform at the fair again and fair officials said they were also reviewing whether to take any action against the @entity20 , the contractor responsible for the event			1
numerous @entity23 officials denounced the act after video and photos were posted online			0
some @entity13 @entity23 lawmakers suggested on monday that there should be financial consequences for the fair			2
' the fair 's press release did not identify the clown			1
at least one person defended him			0
@entity46 , a @entity20 member who was at saturday 's event , described the clown as a friend and said there was nothing offensive or unusual about his actions			1
@entity46 said the @entity3 character was meant to look like a dummy and that rodeo clowns have long performed such acts , often imitating sitting presidents			1
' the joke is not that it was the president , ' @entity46 said			2
' they drag out this person dressed like a dummy and all of the sudden this dummy just takes off running			2
that 's what 's funny			0
' but other rodeo professionals said the @entity23 fair stunt appeared to go too far			1
' it 's not unheard of for a rodeo clown , depending on how he reads his audience , to play politics a little bit , ' said @entity74 , the senior public relations coordinator at the @entity75 , based in @entity76 , @entity77			1
' but this crossed a line			0
clearly , when you 're suggesting that the president should be injured , it kind of gets to a level of hostility that is inappropriate			2
' outcry : many people took to @entity87 to condemn the rodeo act @entity89 , an attendee who posted a photo of the event on @entity92 , has said it had the feeling of @entity96 rally			2
he said that , at one point , another clown ran up to the one wearing the @entity3 mask and played with the lips on the mask			1
the rodeo 's announcer — whom some media initially identified as making the comments about @entity3 — sought monday to distance himself from the clown 's actions			1
announcer @entity108 said through an attorney that the clown was wearing a live microphone and had given the announcer no advance notice about the skit			2
@entity108 is president of the @entity20 and also is superintendent of the @entity116			2
' he was as surprised as anyone with the appearance of an @entity3 - masked rodeo clown , ' said @entity108 's attorney , @entity120 of @entity121			1
@entity120 said @entity108 's only comment during the event was to say , ' watch out for that bull @entity3 ! ' @entity120 said that was meant as a warning for the clown 's safety			1
fair marketing director @entity129 said the rodeo clown was hired by @entity20 and that fair officials did not know he was going to mock @entity3			1
' we 've worked with this company for many , many , many years			0
we have a longstanding history with them and never had any trouble , ' @entity129 said			0
the association did not respond to an email request from @entity140 for an interview on monday and had removed the names of its officers from its website			0
a statement on the site said the association 's directors are ' dealing with the situation firmly and quickly as this type of behavior will not be tolerated			0
' most of the @entity9 's roughly $ 4.5 million budget comes from fees charged to attendees and vendors , but it receives about $ 558,000 from tax revenues , according to the state budget office			0
@entity160 @entity13 have suggested the @entity14 - led chamber should form a special committee to investigate the incident and determine whether to continue providing tax dollars to the fair			2
state republican @entity165 , chairman of the @entity166 , said @entity13 governor @entity167 should cancel the governor 's annual ham breakfast scheduled for thursday at the fairgrounds			0
but @entity167 spokesman @entity171 said the governor did not plan to cancel the breakfast because of the ' deplorable actions that took place during this one event			0
' the stunt on saturday raised fresh concerns about how ridiculing president @entity3 is nothing more than thinly veiled racism			1
one of the other rodeo clowns wobbled the lips of the @entity3 mask , and the man wearing it was forced to run after a bull gave chase , according to a man who witnessed the event			1
boycott : the stunt led to some families and politicians saying they will stop visiting the fair a couple who had taken a foreign exchange student to the fair to show them @entity198 life said they left in disgust after seeing the offensive stunt , according to the @entity202			1
senator @entity203 called the event shameful and unacceptable , according to @entity205 @entity121			0
' the young @entity207 who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse - that somehow it ’s ever acceptable to , in a public event , disrespect , taunt , and joke about harming the president of our great nation , ' ms @entity203 said			1
the @entity217 also issued a statement that called the rodeo ' a show as ugly as any you could see			0
' ' encouraging physical harm to the president , whatever the party , is not acceptable and should not be tolerated , ' the statement read			0
anti-obama sentiment is high in rural @entity23 , where the president lost 60 - 40 per cent to @entity228 in the 2012 election			2
however , the rodeo clown dressed as @entity3 was considered by many to be a joke too far , especially considering the fair , which sells itself as being suitable for people of all ages , is said to have received about $ 400,000 from @entity23 tax payers			1
@entity237 , executive director at the @entity238 , was one of many people who took to social media to condemn the event			0
' i like rodeos , i like funnel cake			0
barely - veiled racism , anti-americanism and violence fantasies ruin them , ' he said on @entity87			0

' according to @entity205 @entity121 , she added : ' since november 2008 , racism has been masked under the guise of " anti-obama sentiment "			0
' state republican @entity266 said she was angered and disgusted by ' the blatant racism ' , adding : ' this is an embarrassment to the @entity269			0
' @entity270 , another @entity14 , added on @entity87 : ' i do n’t agree w / this prez on many things			0
but he is deserving of respect and should n’t be the object of political stunts			0
out of line ! ' several people took to the state fair 's @entity92 page to state their disgust at the rodeo show , saying it was disrespectful and claiming they would boycott the fair next year			1
a spokesman for @entity9 earlier told @entity286 : ' the performance by one of the rodeo clowns at saturday 's event was inappropriate and disrespectful , and does not reflect the opinions or standards of the @entity9			1
