last night it was unclear how much the 32 - year - old can expect in compensation , but it was believed she was planning to claim as much as £ 5million			1
the tribunal heard that colleagues referred to her as ‘ mad @entity1 ’ and told her to visit @entity24 for sex with tribesmen to ‘ calm her down ’			1
other phrases male co-workers used to describe her included ‘ crazy ’ , ‘ mental ’ , ‘ totally unstable ’ , ‘ quite likely clinically bonkers ’ and a ‘ major car crash ’			1

mr @entity40 told the tribunal he regretted making some comments but claimed miss @entity1 had insulted him			1
he has since reportedly left the bank by ‘ mutual consent ’			0
the tribunal rejected 19 of the 22 complaints made by @entity60 but found in her favour on the substantive areas of harassment and intimidation on the grounds of her gender			2
judges said there was no evidence over claims that she was put under surveillance by the bank , that she had not been paid the relevant sick pay while off work and that she had been put on a list of ‘ underperformers ’ because of her poor relationship with mr @entity40			0
miss @entity1 worked in @entity14 's @entity80 office where she claimed she was victimised before being unfairly dismissed miss @entity1 made her allegations after a second term of working at @entity14 ’s @entity13 office in 2011 , when she was earning a six - figure salary alongside a guaranteed annual bonus of £ 200,000			1
however , in january 2012 she went on leave because of stress , claiming there was a ‘ hostile environment ’ on the male - dominated equity sales desk			2

these guys would help ’			0
miss @entity1 ’s barrister , @entity99 , @entity100 , said many comments showed a ‘ demeaning and offensive attitude towards women in general and to @entity60 in particular ’			2
mr @entity40 said he now accepted that describing miss @entity1 as ‘ @entity9 ’ was both untrue and defamatory of a woman who had never taken drugs			2
the @entity106 heard that prior to leaving the bank , miss @entity1 had generated £ 20million in profits during two stints with the company and on one occasion had even been awarded a £ 600,000 cash bonus			1
@entity113 , who was in charge of the @entity13 office , ' failed to manage properly the severity of the situation as it developed ' @entity14 , the former @entity118 savings bank , has been transformed under @entity119 , a former economy minister for @entity15 president @entity120			0
the bank is @entity15 ’s largest lender , held almost half of the nation ’s deposits last year and has diversified into investment banking and asset management			0
the resources of @entity14 and its subsidiary @entity128 @entity42 , where miss @entity1 worked , have now been integrated under @entity43 ( @entity42 ) ltd. the tribunal ruled that @entity113 , who was in charge of the @entity13 office , also ‘ failed to manage properly the situation as it developed with mr @entity40 ’			1
it added : ‘ his lamentable inaction caused detriment to the claimant and amounts in our view to victimisation			0
‘ what he should have done was to suspend mr @entity40 and ensure that a proper disciplinary process was taken against him			0
’ damages awarded by the tribunal are normally capped at £ 70,000 but they are unlimited in discrimination cases			0
miss @entity1 is the second woman to win a sexual discrimination lawsuit in @entity13 this year			1

the 32 - year - old was called a ' car crash ' and ' mentally unstable ' by male colleagues , the tribunal heard			1
nineteen of the 22 complaints made by @entity60 were rejected by the @entity106 last night @entity14 ’s spokesman @entity160 said in a statement : ‘ @entity43 and the management team in @entity13 are committed to equal opportunities and promoting diversity in its workplace , and did not expect this decision			0
‘ although pleased that the tribunal found no wrongdoing on the part of the firm or its employees in relation to 19 complaints made by the claimant , we are disappointed that the tribunal upheld a small number of allegations			0
miss @entity1 claimed she was unfairly dismissed from the @entity15 firm @entity14 , the largest bank in @entity179 ‘ we can not comment further on the specifics of the judgment , which we are reviewing closely with our legal team , but we are committed to take on board any lessons to be learned			0
