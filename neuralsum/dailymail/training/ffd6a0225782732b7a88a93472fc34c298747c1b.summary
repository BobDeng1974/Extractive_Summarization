by @entity0 the @entity1 has blown through nearly $ 300 million to create a new computer system to handle disability claims -- and the @entity5 - led project still does n't work			1
six years ago the @entity1 embarked on an aggressive plan to replace outdated computer systems overwhelmed by a growing flood of disability claims			1
today , the new system is nowhere near ready and agency officials are struggling to salvage a project racked by delays and mismanagement , according to an internal report commissioned by the agency			1
in 2008 , @entity1 said the project was about two to three years from completion			1
five years later , it was still two to three years from being done , according to the report by @entity22 , a management consulting firm			2
today , with the project still in the testing phase , the agency ca n't say when it will be completed or how much it will cost			2
hot seat : acting social security commissioner @entity29 's agency has failed to implement a new computer system to handle disability claims - despite spending $ 288million in the meantime , people filing for disability claims face long delays at nearly every step of the process — delays that were supposed to be reduced by the new processing system			1
' the program has invested $ 288 million over six years , delivered limited functionality , and faced schedule delays as well as increasing stakeholder concerns , ' the report said			1
as a result , agency leaders have decided to ' reset ' the program in an effort to save it , the report said			2
as part of that effort , @entity1 brought in the outside consultants from @entity22 to figure out what went wrong			0
they found a massive technology initiative with no one in charge — no single person responsible for completing the project			2
they issued their report in june , though it was not publicly released			0
as part of @entity22 's recommendations , acting social security commissioner @entity61 appointed @entity64 to oversee the project last month			2
@entity64 had been an assistant deputy commissioner			0
' we asked for this , this independent look , and we were n't afraid to hear what the results are , ' @entity64 said in an interview wednesday			0
' we are absolutely committed to deliver this initiative and by implementing the recommendations we obtained independently , we think we have a very good prospect on doing just that			0
' fail ! after some six years , @entity1 officials still do n't know how much longer their beleaguered new software will take to be finished the revelations come at an awkward time for @entity80			1
president @entity81 nominated @entity80 to a full six - year term in june , and she now faces confirmation by the @entity85			2
@entity80 was deputy commissioner for 3½ years before becoming acting commissioner in february 2013			2
the @entity87 is also looking into the program , and whether @entity1 officials tried to bury the @entity22 report			0
in a letter to @entity80 on wednesday , committee leaders requested all documents and communications about the computer project since march 1			0
the letter was signed by rep. @entity96 , @entity97 , chairman of the @entity99 , and @entity100			0
@entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 , @entity105 they called the project ' an it boondoggle			0
' the troubled computer project is known at the @entity109 , or @entity109			0
it was supposed to replace 54 separate , antiquated computer systems used by state @entity1 offices to process disability claims			1
as envisioned , workers across the country would be able to use the system to process claims and track them as benefits are awarded or denied , and claims are appealed			0
but as of april , the system could n't even process all new claims , let alone accurately track them as they wound their way through the system , the report said			1
in all , more than 380 problems were still outstanding , and users had n't even started testing the ability of the system to handle applications from children			0
boondoggle : congressman @entity96 is investigating whether @entity1 officials tried to bury the audit outlining the agency 's crippling problems ' the @entity109 project is adrift , the scope of the project is ambiguous , the project has been poorly executed , and the project 's development lacks leadership , ' the three lawmakers said in their letter to @entity80			1
@entity145 - based @entity5 was selected in 2011 as the prime contractor on the project			1
at the time , the company valued the contract at up to $ 200 million , according to a press release			1
@entity22 's report does not specifically fault @entity5 but raises the possibility of changing vendors , and says @entity1 officials need to better manage the project			1
@entity64 said @entity1 will continue to work with @entity5 ' to make sure that we are successful in the delivery of this program			1
' @entity158 , a spokesman for @entity5 , would only say that the company is committed to delivering the program			1
money guzzlers : ceo @entity162 's @entity5 is the main contractor behind the failing @entity1 project , which was valued at $ 200 million the report comes as the disability program edges toward the brink of insolvency			1
the trust fund that supports @entity1 's disability program is projected to run out of money in 2016			1
at that point , the system will collect only enough money in payroll taxes to pay 80 percent of benefits , triggering an automatic 20 percent cut in benefits			2
@entity178 could redirect money from @entity1 's much bigger retirement program to shore up the disability program , as it did in 1994			1
but that would worsen the finances of the retirement program , which is facing its own long - term financial problems			2
social security disability claims are first processed through a network of field offices and state agencies called @entity189			0
there are 54 of these offices , and they all use different computer systems , @entity64 said			0
if your claim is rejected , you can ask the state agency to reconsider			0
if your claim is rejected again , you can appeal to an administrative law judge , who is employed by @entity1			0
it takes more than 100 days , on average , to processing initial applications , according to agency data			0
the average processing time for a hearing before an administrative law judge is more than 400 days			0
the new processing system is supposed to help alleviate some of these delays .			0

@entity208 struggles to salvage aggressive plan to replace outdated disability software system
project remains two to three years from completion , despite being already some two years behind - schedule
audit *suggests* *dumping* @entity5 , which stood to make some $ 200 million from contract
money - wasting project rubs salt in the wound as disability program edges toward the brink of insolvency
