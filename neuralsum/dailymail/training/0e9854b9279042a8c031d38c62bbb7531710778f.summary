finally , after 22 minutes inside the @entity3 , the combination of @entity1 and @entity2 crackled into life			1
sadly , after a lightning storm interrupted @entity8 ’s final friendly before the @entity9 , we only ever got to see flashes of the pairing ’s potential			2
on saturday evening , when @entity8 face @entity14 in the opening group game of the @entity9 in @entity16 , it will have to come together			1
room for improvement : @entity2 ( left ) failed to find the back of the net against @entity21 going for goal : @entity1 ( left ) bends a free - kick towards goal during the first half @entity1 was substituted at half - time on saturday night , but the duo will still be paired against @entity14			1
@entity1 and @entity2 have n’t played nearly enough football together and this was the last chance before the team flew overnight to their @entity30 training base			2
@entity2 really should have scored when @entity31 and @entity1 broke through the @entity21 defence midway through the first half			1
the @entity34 striker , who turned neatly inside the penalty area , skewed his shot wide of the target			2
@entity2 has scored four times for his country and will know that he could have easily added another			0
it will come and he does n’t care who his partner is			0
he ’s in top form , flush full of confidence after scoring 21 goals for @entity34 in the @entity46			1
there is a maturity about his game — he is a willing team player in @entity51 ’s disciplined and organised 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation			0
it feels as though he is @entity8 ’s main goal threat — the most likely to change a game in the same way that @entity56 did in his country ’s colours			0
frustrated figure : @entity2 kicks out at a post after a save from @entity21 goalkeeper @entity62 ( left ) dejected : @entity1 trudges off the pitch after @entity8 's disappointing 0 - 0 draw with @entity21 there were bursts from @entity1 , too , after @entity8 ’s head coach restored him to his favoured position for this final work - out			1
the @entity72 striker is the only player to start all three friendlies ahead of the @entity9			0
he did n’t finish this one , however , and was replaced by the livewire @entity75 for the second period			0
next week , @entity1 must turn it on in tournament football			0
that was his promise in @entity81 when he arrived in @entity82 do lobo a full week ahead of schedule to make sure that he was in shape this summer			0
he owes @entity8 at a @entity9 , particularly after his subdued performances in 2006 and 2010			1
missed opportunities : @entity2 ( left ) missed trio of good chances at the @entity3 in @entity90 pressure : @entity1 ( left ) has failed to score a @entity9 goal for @entity8 despite making the squad in 2006 and 2010 it has been a difficult week for @entity51 to prepare his team , particularly after they were forced to abandon their training session at @entity98 last monday			1
they were forced into a campus gym because of the hurricane season and on saturday , with the score 0 - 0 , the teams had to leave the field of play			1
@entity8 were well aware of the risks when they booked their week - long stay in @entity90 and went ahead with the plan			2
@entity51 remains convinced that his squad are ready for the challenges ahead when they arrive at base camp in @entity30			0
what they will need now is some positive forward thinking .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 failed to score as @entity8 drew 0 - 0 with @entity21
the pair must find their form when the @entity8 face @entity14 in their @entity9 opener next saturday
@entity1 is under pressure to deliver after failing in 2006 and 2010
@entity2 *appears* full of confidence after his *excellent* season for @entity34
