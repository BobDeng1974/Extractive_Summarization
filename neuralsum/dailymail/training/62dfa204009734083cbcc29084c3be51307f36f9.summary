by @entity0 published : 01:19 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 05:13 est , 13 august 2013 an animal lover who befriended a stray puppy while volunteering in @entity3 raised £ 3,000 to have it flown back to @entity5			1
@entity6 , 26 , flew the sick mongrel more than 6,200 miles back to the @entity8 after she cared for it while she was away			1
the 26 - year - old first met the dog when it had lost most of its hair and had a distended stomach before she set off on a fishing trip			1
@entity6 , 26 , pulled out all the stops to bring two - month - old mongrel @entity15 back to the @entity8 she saw the two - month - old dog again on her return to the beach and looked after it in the hostel where she was staying between last september and december			1
miss @entity6 paid for the puppy to be treated by a vet who told her that it was only two weeks from death as it was in such a poor condition			1
she then arranged for the puppy , which she named @entity15 , to be cared for by the @entity26 when she returned to @entity27 , @entity28			2
@entity15 is now getting used to life at the @entity28 seaside after the 17 hour journey from @entity3 miss @entity32 received regular updates about its progress from animal shelter staff before deciding to fly the dog back to her home			1
she raised the cash with the help of her parents @entity41 and @entity42 to fly back to pay for her to @entity3 so she could collect the puppy and bring it to the @entity8			1
@entity15 is now getting used to life at the @entity28 seaside after the 17 hour journey from @entity3			1
miss @entity6 , who works at a school in @entity46 , said : ' i was certain he would n't know who i was - but he was so happy to see me , wagging his tail			1
' i was bawling my eyeballs out			0
he 's a great dog and everyone loves him so much			0
' miss @entity6 said the puppy was one of many strays roaming around when she first saw it			1
she said : ' he was so tiny and in an absolutely dreadful state			0
' he had this chain round his neck which was cutting into his neck , and he looked emaciated and his stomach was all distended			0
' he had severe mange and no fur - totally bald , and just kept scratching his skin			2
' we managed to get some bolt croppers and cut the chain off , and a vet later told me @entity15 had been two weeks from death			2
' it 's a completely different culture over there - they do n't have dogs as pets like we do			2
' they eat dogs , and dogs that roam are likely to be attacked and killed by other dogs			0
' i just could n't let that happen			0
i took him with me back to the hostel and immediately tried to find a vet to help him			0
' the teacher looked after @entity15 in the hostel where she was staying in @entity3 she said she became increasingly frantic as she tried to find a charity or rescue centre to take care of the puppy before she left			1
eventually @entity91 at the @entity26 ( @entity92 ) agreed to help find him a home			0
miss @entity6 said : ' i reluctantly handed him over			2
' i know it will sound stupid to anyone who has not got a relationship with animals like my mum and i , but i do n't think i could have come home without @entity26 taking him - it was such a relief			2
' when i got home mum and i had a bawl together			0
i just knew i had to bring him home here			0
' people will say why that dog , why not one from the @entity107 or @entity108 , which we also support			0
' i think it was an emotional response , and we had made such a strong bond			0

@entity6 , 26 , flew the sick mongrel more than 6,200 miles to the @entity8
@entity115 when he was two - months - old and weeks from dying
