funny : a girl who had her phone stolen while on holiday is able to see all of the photographs taken by the man who now has it - every time he takes a picture with her phone they upload onto her computer			1
this is @entity29 , the man who has the girl 's phone silly : one of the earliest pics posted by @entity29 was this one of him on a beach in @entity15 - with the @entity35 , the tallest building in the world , in the background curious : @entity29 clearly enjoys visiting new locations and getting friends to take pictures of him the pictures were taken from a smartphone which was stolen from a beach in @entity45			1
the man who now has the phone has used it to take dozens of pictures of himself - completely unaware that every single one is automatically uploaded onto the owner 's computer			1
the unnamed girl has now started a blog in which she uploads every picture the man takes , with hilarious results			1
pictures show the man - called @entity59 - posing in various locations around @entity15 , often taking extraordinary selfies of himself			1
one picture shows him posing on a beach beside the tallest building in the world while another has him in front of a mosque with friends			2
there is no evidence to suggest that @entity29 stole the phone or knows that the phone is stolen			2
the girl managed to find out @entity29 's name when he entered her @entity80 account using her phone and sent her a personal message from his own account			2
writing on her blog , the girl said she was on a beach in @entity45 with four friends when her phone was taken			1
she wrote : ' we found ourselves hopelessly drunk and naked in the sea			0
we put our stuff on a deck chair 10m away			0
@entity91 : @entity29 clearly likes this car and decided to have his picture taken next to it happy : @entity29 relaxes with a pot of tea chilled : sat on a piece of grass , @entity29 appears relaxed , completely unaware that his pictures are being sent to the phone 's owner ' when i ran back to the deck chair to get rid of my underpants , i noticed someone lying stiffly under the chair , not moving , not reacting			2
' after thinking that it was her friend , she went back to swimming with her friends in the sea			0
however , she later realised it was not her friend but the phone thief , who proceeded to steal all of their belongings			0
' we tumbled out of the water quite irritated			0
money , purses , smartphones , passports , birthday presents and clothes			0
' back at the reception , wet , drunk and still semi-nude , the receptionist refused to help us , he said this happened like every day and nobody cared anymore			0
@entity132 time : @entity29 clearly enjoys looking at himself , as these pictures demonstrate @entity29 poses with two friends outside a mosque			0
the girl 's phone was taken while she swam in a beach in @entity45 @entity139 : through the pictures , @entity29 manages to show that he does have a sense of humour ' apparently some guys with night - vision glasses hid in the dunes , waiting for drunk tourists to leave their belongings somewhere unobserved			1
then they crawled through the sand , stole the stuff and walked away like nothing happened			0
' it was four months after the holiday that the girl turned on her computer and noticed fifteen new pictures inside her camera upload folder			0
