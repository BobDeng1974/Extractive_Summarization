during the screening of the 1995 documentary about nightmare neighbours @entity10 ’s wife @entity45 bragged how she painted her house pink , bought a goat and wanted to buy crowing cockerels ‘ just to annoy locals ’			1
last week , the court heard how @entity10 - who has breached his asbo preventing him from ' harassing and tormenting ' his neighbours at least five times since it was handed out in 2006 - had ' not changed his ways '			1
the court heard how he repeatedly lit bonfires - some which burned for as long as seven hours - to send smelly smoke into neighbouring gardens			1
during a two day trial , the court heard from @entity62 , who said @entity10 ’s behaviour left her ' constantly on edge '			1
she told the court how on august 29 2010 she was reading a book in her bedroom when stinking smoke started wafting in			2
she said : ' i shut my windows because smoke was going everywhere			0
i should be allowed to have the windows open on a summer ’s day			0
' it all seemed to be a deliberate act to cause annoyance and be as much of a nuisance as possible			0
' and it was not just going into the immediate neighbours ’ gardens , it was going round the whole neighbourhood			0
there was a blanket of smoke across the gardens			0
' she told the @entity86 that @entity10 lit another bonfire on august 30 and that he then started ‘ shouting ’ about building a ‘ super smoky ’ bonfire the next day			1
she told the court : ' he said he was going to light a bonfire and that it was going to be bigger and he was going to make it as smoky as possible			2
' he was doing it loud enough so everyone would hear him			0
' @entity95 said at a previous court hearing about living with @entity10 as a neighbour for the last 20 years			1
he told the court : ' it has ruined the quality of life for myself and many other residents			2
' i ca n’t convey just how much of a detrimental effect this is having			0
' at an earlier hearing at @entity107 prosecutor @entity105 said : ' the asbo is currently in place to prevent the defendant from using words or behaviour to residents and neighbours that are abusive , threatening or insulting			2
' the defendant is accused of persistently lighting fires which produced smoke that was foul - smelling			0
' he did not just use wood to keep the fire burning - he lit these fires over four successive days			0
' it drove neighbours to put a hose pipe over the fence			0
' @entity10 , who was ordered by the council to stop having bonfires in november 2010 and to attend ‘ counselling sessions ’ to address his behaviour , denied burning plastic , said he only ‘ burned wood from trees chopped down in his garden ’			1
he was , however , found guilty of harassment without violence before the case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report .			0
