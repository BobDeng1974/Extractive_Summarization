@entity0 , 34 , swindled more than £ 120,000 in benefits that he was not entitled to a benefits cheat swindled £ 120,000 by claiming he was wheelchair bound , but was actually working as a tv aerial fitter and climbing onto roofs , a court heard			1
@entity0 , 34 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , dishonestly obtained state benefits over a period of eight years , including child tax credits where he claimed two of his daughters were severely disabled			1
he also callously charged an 88 - year - old woman £ 7,500 for a fuse box , which he never even fitted , and used the money to buy a van for his satellite dish installation business , @entity20			1
@entity0 appeared at @entity21 on a mobile scooter and as he complained of hearing difficulties had to be wheeled into the body of the court for the hearing			1
a jury heard that the elderly woman had lost trust in anyone calling at her @entity8 home afterwards and ' lived out the last year of her life effectively without opening the door '			2
judge @entity34 said : ' the impact of the offence on her , i have no doubt , accelerated the decline in her health			0
you performed a wicked con trick on her , conning her out of £ 7,500 so you could buy yourself a van			1
' when her concerned friend and neighbour pursued the matter he ' blustered and bluffed and did your best to intimidate her ' , judge said			0
by the time his dishonesty came to light he had obtained £ 120,878 in benefits over an eight year period			1
some he obtained from the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) by purporting he was too immobile to work			0
while the rest came from @entity60 ( @entity61 ) where he claimed the opposite - that he was working and needed top up working tax credits			2
he also obtained child care credits for his five children and ' particularly callously and cynically told lies that two were disabled , ' said the judge			1
@entity69 @entity21 heard that when @entity0 told the @entity58 in 2005 that he was unable to walk he spoke of hoping for an operation so he could get back to work ' as i believe a man should provide for his family but i can not at the moment			1
' @entity0 pleaded guilty to five @entity58 fraud offences spanning eight years and five trading standards offences involving fraud and engaging in unfair commercial practices			2
judge @entity80 sentenced him to 39 months in prison and afterwards he had to be escorted by the dock officers to a suitable taxi to take him to prison - as the scooter was too large to get into the holding cells downstairs			1
judge @entity80 said that while he accepted he has diabetes and complained of pain ' there is little objective clinical evidence of substantial medical difficulties			0
' @entity92 , defending , said that @entity0 , who has previous convictions for fraud , had never been to jail and because of his ' bulk ' he would find that difficult and his children would miss him			2
he added that he had mobility problems because of the affect on his legs of his weight			0
@entity102 , prosecuting , said that @entity0 began legitimately claiming incapacity benefit in 2002 and said he could no longer work as a welder because of pain in his knees			2
he was sentenced to 39 months in prison after he appeared in his mobility scooter at @entity21 but in 2005 when he claimed he was unable to walk at all he notified @entity61 that he was working 16 hours a week as a carpet cleaner and claimed tax credits			1
investigations later showed that been 2006 and 2012 , £ 40,000 was paid into his bank account - mainly in cheques from his work activities , said mr @entity102			0
he also claimed child care credits claiming that his wife also worked 16 hours a week and the children were in a nursery costing hundreds of pounds a week			1
however , she was not working and they were not at a nursery and the prosecution claimed ' it was complete fiction '			0
in 2009 he said that two of his daughters were disabled so their credit claim would be enhanced			0
' that was completely false , neither was disabled or in receipt of disability living allowance ' he added			0
@entity0 had been claiming @entity130 for himself since 2006 and the next year when he renewed his claim he stated he needed a wheelchair to get around			2
he also told authorities that he needed his wife to care for him ' every hour of the day ' , could not get upstairs and needed help to feed himself			0
mr @entity102 added that it was not claimed it was false from the start but by early 2010 there had been a significant improvement and he began running an aerial and satelilte dish installation business , involving climbing up ladders and onto roofs			0
the prosecutor said that the pensioner who @entity0 charged an ' exorbitant ' amount for a fuse box had met him earlier and got in touch because he also dealt with electrical matters			1
after his deception came to light she was left upset , frightened , her health deteriorated and she no longer trusted anyone and kept her curtains closed			0
meanwhile he banked her cheque and spent £ 4,840 on a new van which carried logos , as did his website , claiming he was affiliated with various trade bodies , which was untrue			0
