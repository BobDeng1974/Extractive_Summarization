' the latest figures suggest that @entity4 tourists are already spending many millions of pounds on short breaks abroad but culture vultures can cut their costs by doing their homework in advance and swapping to a city like @entity23 or @entity51 where prices are significantly lower than better known cultural capitals like @entity86 or @entity87			1
