@entity0 has been dubbed ' too posh for @entity1 ' after game makers were told there is nowhere low - rent enough to fill the space of @entity6 it 's the most popular board game in the world , with hundreds of versions springing up in far - flung cities across the globe			1
but monopoly - makers planning a special @entity0 edition have been told there is nowhere low - rent enough to fill the space of @entity6			1
thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across the city in @entity18 to fill the more expensive slots , which are taken up on the @entity21 version by the likes of @entity23 and @entity24			0
but no one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board , which cost $ 60 in @entity1 money			2
high - end game zones have been easily filled with locations like the city 's @entity33 , @entity0 castle , the @entity36 and modern shopping centre			1
but @entity0 has outdone all previous cities to get their own board - including @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 - in the posh stakes , with no suggestions for the lower end			2
game - makers say they have developed boards for cities across the country but have never come across the current dilemma			1
@entity52 leader @entity51 said there were no areas suitable for the brown spots , which are taken up in @entity21 by @entity6 and @entity56			1
he said : ' i think they will have a problem - there is nowhere cheap in @entity0 that would be suitable for the @entity6 spot			1
' i do n't know about being the poshest - but it is such a nice city that no - where really deserves to occupy it			0
thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across @entity0 to fill the more expensive slots , such as the cathedral no one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board , which cost $ 60 in @entity1 money ' the board was designed on the streets of @entity21 and it is a nigh on impossible task to replicate that in @entity0			1
' whoever does get @entity6 will be castigated for it - and will not deserve it			0
' @entity0 recently for opened some @entity80 's poshest student flats in the city centre - costing Â£ 1,000 a month - and there are several more luxury developments planned			2
the influx of well - to - do students - together with the arrival of big name shops and restaurants such as @entity89 and @entity91 's @entity90 in recent years - has seen a resurgence in the city centre			0
resident @entity94 , 32 , of @entity0 , said : ' @entity0 has certainly got posher over the years and i do n't think there is anywhere that deserves the tag of @entity6			2
' i think the influx of rich students has had a lot to do with it with a lot of luxury developments and money being brought in			0
' i would n't say that most locals are particularly posh - but just proud of the area they live in			0
' @entity52 leader @entity51 said there were no areas suitable for the brown @entity1 ( board game pictured ) spots , which are taken up in @entity21 by @entity6 and @entity56 the makers of the game have launched a second appeal for recommendations for any @entity0 landmark that can replace @entity6 , and bosses were sent to the city today to hunt a location down			1
@entity121 , @entity122 at @entity123 moves @entity80 said : ' over the years we have produced boards for perceived well - heeled places - such as @entity40 , for example - but we have never come across a situation like this			0
' we have had a dearth of suggestions for an @entity0 equivalent of @entity6 compared to every other location so @entity0 could well be the poshest place in @entity80			2
' but we have to fill this space			0
as we do every one of the 22 locations from the @entity21 original is handed over to an @entity0 landmark or address			0

@entity0 is getting its own special edition of *classic* board game @entity1
but residents ca n't think of anywhere to fill low - rent spaces on the board
game - makers say they have never come across this issue in a city before
@entity156 leader says there are no areas suitable to be @entity6
