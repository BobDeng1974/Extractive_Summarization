accused of murder : @entity7 , left , was allegedly killed by @entity5 , right , who went on to hide her body and pretend she was still alive , a jury at the @entity0 was told she was last seen shopping with him for a holiday they were due to take two days later in june 1995			1
but the prosecution said he killed her , took her body to a lock - up garage and reported her missing the next day			2
the body of the mother of two boys has never been found and the evidence against @entity5 was only circumstantial , said @entity24 , prosecuting			1
' this case is rather different in a number of respects from many cases tried in this court , ' he said			0
' the prosecution have no evidence of a dead body			0
' we say that although she is dead her body has n't been discovered			0
we say there is a reason for this			0
' after this defendant killed her he managed to dispose of the body in such a way as to conceal it from the authorities or anyone else who might come across it and bring it to the attention of the authorities			0
' another particular feature is this : the prosecution have no direct evidence that the defendant was responsible for @entity7 's death			1
' we are not in a position to call any eyewitnesses who claim to have seen the murderous attack and there is no @entity57 evidence			0
' indeed , there is no evidence this defendant has ever admitted he killed @entity7			1
' instead , the prosecution relies on what is commonly referred to as circumstantial evidence			0
' @entity5 , a married father - of - four who now works as a black cab driver , claims miss @entity7 had decided to start a new life with another man			1
but public appeals and searches with @entity69 have failed to track her down , the court heard			0
@entity5 and miss @entity7 began a ' volatile , on - off ' relationship in 1992 after they met in a nightclub and had a son together in april 1994			1
he was married at the time and had a house with his wife in east @entity77 , but would often stay at his lover 's flat in @entity79 , @entity80 , north @entity77			2
@entity5 , who worked at the time in a warehouse for craft firm @entity82 , took her on lavish holidays to destinations including @entity85 and the @entity86			1

never found : ms @entity7 's body has not been found by police , a jury at the @entity0 ( pictured ) heard but mr @entity107 said : ' the prosecution contention is that this aspect of his statement is a lie			1
' it was a lie that was told to conceal the fact that actually he drove elsewhere for purposes connected to her murder			2
' we suggest the lock - up garage he kept in @entity121 is the most likely destination			0
' plainly it was a perfect place to keep someone he had either abducted or killed			0
' after returning to miss @entity7 's council flat , @entity5 made a series of phone calls from his mobile to her landline and pretended to others that he was talking to her			1
he also told her son @entity132 , then aged 14 , that he was certain his mother would return and called a neighbour to say he would go out looking for his mistress in local pubs			0
' but the prosecution say this was just a charade , ' said mr @entity107			0
' he was n't looking for her in local pubs			0
the evidence shows he had driven his car back to the @entity142 area			0
' the fact is he was effectively manufacturing for himself a false alibi			0
' miss @entity7 was devoted to her family and the idea she would disappear without once contacting them was ' beyond fanciful ' , he added			1
@entity5 had booked a holiday to @entity150 for the weekend after her disappearance , but cancelled it after she vanished , the court was told			1
but with no body and no hard evidence linking him to the disappearance , the investigation was closed on september 1 , 1995			0
@entity5 was not re-arrested until may 29 last year			1
when he was quizzed by police he said he was not a jealous man and denied he had argued with miss @entity7 in the run - up to her disappearance			1
mr @entity107 said a few hours after she disappeared , @entity5 used his mobile to secretly ring miss @entity7 's flat in @entity80 , north @entity77			1
he picked up the phone and was heard to say : ' where are you now ? ' the babysitters said @entity5 looked ' sweaty and panicky ' and claimed it was miss @entity7 on the phone , saying she would be home later			1
mr @entity107 added : ' this purported phone call was nothing more than a continuation of the charade the defendant had embarked upon			2
' this call was not made by @entity7			2
the call came from his mobile			0
he was pretending to speak to @entity7			1
' shortly afterwards , the phone rang again when miss @entity7 's teenage son @entity132 returned home and asked where his mother was			1
he heard @entity5 say : ' do n't worry , come home			2
' mr @entity107 said : ' this was the second sham telephone the defendant made to the flat using his mobile phone , pretending to be @entity7			1
essentially , he was trying to manufacture an alibi			0
' @entity5 was questioned about her abduction in 1995 but was arrested last year after a murder inquiry was launched			1
he told officers they had an on - off relationship during the three years they were together , with him sometimes living with his wife			0
mr @entity107 added : ' he said he did not kill @entity7 and they had not argued			2
' he said he was not a jealous person even though they had split up on a number of occasions			0
' he said he kept going back and was besotted with her			0
it was a sexual thing and he was not in love with her			0
' mr @entity107 said @entity5 , who had three children from his marriage , was working as a warehouse manager at the time and often hired vans			2
miss @entity7 liked going on holidays and he would pay for her and her family to travel to countries such as @entity205			2
