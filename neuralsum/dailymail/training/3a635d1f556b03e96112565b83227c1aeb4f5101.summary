@entity6 , 85 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , endured a 20 minute procedure to have red rose etched onto her upper arm			1
the work of art was carried out by her granddaughter , @entity13 , 26 , who opened her own tattoo studio in @entity15 , @entity8 , six years ago			1
never too old for body art : @entity6 , 85 , proudly shows off her first tattoo inspiration : @entity6 had always admired her granddaughter @entity13 's tattoos family affair : as @entity13 is a tattoo artist , she etched the rose on her grandmother 's arm ' prickly feeling ' : the great - grandmother said it did n't hurt @entity6 , who has six grandchildren and five great grandchildren , explained : ' i 'm incredibly proud of @entity13 and i think her tattoos are wonderful			1
' i think it 's so marvellous that they can do all this beautiful artwork on flesh and i wanted to show appreciation for @entity13 and her work , so i asked if she would do a tattoo for me			1
' as she was : eve , aged ten , left , used to live in @entity40 and was once a @entity41 in the @entity42 she married @entity43 in 1948 : he said he likes her tattoo but would n't want one himself the retired shop worker , who was born in @entity40 and was once a @entity41 in the @entity42 , chose the floral design in honour of her late mother , whose first name was @entity50			1
she said : ' i 'm very happy with my tattoo			2
i 'm happy i chose a @entity50 for my mother			2
my middle name is also @entity50 and it symbolises the @entity55 rose so i am very pleased with it indeed			2
' i did n’t think it hurt at all , it was more like a prickly feeling			0
but i do think one tattoo is enough for me and i wo n’t be getting anymore done			2
' @entity13 , who has a seven - year - old daughter , @entity61 , said she was initially reluctant to fulfil her grandmother 's wishes			1
proud : eve with @entity13 as a baby grown up : @entity13 now has her own tattoo studio in @entity15 she said : ' i do n't think anyone in the family really believed grandma when she kept saying she wanted me to do a tattoo for her			1
i think we all thought she 'd gone a bit mad			0
' but she kept on asking and then one saturday we were out having coffee and grandma turned to me and said " when are you going to do my tattoo ? " that 's when i realised she was being serious			2
' i had a slot free that afternoon so i brought her into the studio and sat her down at my work station			0
i kept asking " are you sure you want to do this , grandma ? " but she was one hundred per cent certain so we just got on with it from there			0
@entity13 has many tattoos and admitted she was initially reluctant to tattoo her grandmother in case she hurt her flower power : @entity6 chose a rose in memory of her mother delighted with the result : @entity13 thought her grandmother had been kidding about getting a tattoo but was happy to oblige when she knew she was serious she added : ' i was absolutely petrified about tattooing my gran			1
i was worried it was going to hurt her but she just did n't seem phased at all			0
she did n't squirm , she just sat there and said " ooh " a few times			0
i was definitely more nervous than she was			0
' the tattoo took about twenty minutes altogether			0
after i 'd finished gran seemed really impressed with the final result and now she 's always showing it off to her friends			2
' eve , who lives with retired sales director husband @entity43 , 86 , said she 's delighted with the result : ' i am very glad i have finally had it done after all those years of thinking about it , and i am glad @entity13 was the one to do it for me too			1
' my friends are all amazed but love it too			0
they think i ’m very brave			0
my husband likes the tattoo but he would n't have one himself			0
