by @entity0 a large hole has been spotted on the middle - right of the six wheels on @entity5 ’s @entity4			1
the coin - sized dent caused by a sharp rock has left a gaping hole in the tyre			2
it is the newest of many bumps and bruises the 1 - ton vehicle has experienced since it landed on the red planet in august 2012			1
the dent is the latest in several bumps and bruises the rover has experienced on the red planet , which has surprised engineers			1
it is not a problem for now but could become one if the hole grows in size the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			1
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity19			1
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity19			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity37 at approximately 2,000lb ( 900kg )			0
scientists considered 60 different possible landing sites before deciding to set @entity4 down in @entity40			2
mission controllers are confident that even with one or several wheels being damaged in this way , they will still be able to achieve @entity4 ’s goals			1
the rover is currently making its way to the base of @entity48 , an interesting mountain that could reveal secrets about the history of @entity19			2
while this damage will not hinder the mission , it will be cause for concern as it shows how susceptible it really is to rocks			2
‘ they are taking damage , ’ said @entity4 project manager @entity57 in @entity58 about the wheels , reports @entity60			1
‘ that ’s the surprise we got back at the end of last year			0
‘ we always expected we would get some holes in the wheels as we drove			0
‘ it ’s just the magnitude of what we ’re seeing that was the surprise			0
' curiosity has recently driven out of the ellipse , approximately 4 miles wide and 12 miles long ( 7 kilometers by 20 kilometers ) , that was mapped as safe terrain for its 2012 landing inside @entity40			2
it was snapped by the @entity78 crossing the ' boundary ' on 27 june ( pictured ) each of the six alumnium wheels is independently operated and is built to withstand the harshness of the @entity19 environment			2
this particular damage is found on the ' grousers ' of the wheel ( bottom wheel in this image ) , which is the zigzag - like pattern that helps them grip the terrain the worst case scenario is that one of the wheels could be completely torn to shreds and become unusable			1
this would mean it would have to be dragged across the surface of @entity19 by the other five wheels , and any flailing damage could also pose a risk to exposed wires			1
the chances of this happening are low , but the engineers are still surprised at how much of a beating the rover has taken in just under two years			2
one of the main culprits has been ‘ caprock ’ , flat areas of hard @entity19 rock			0
in attempts to avoid going over these areas engineers have been trying to spot softer and sandier areas from the @entity78 currently circling the planet			0
another solution to avoid such damage is to minimise turning , drive backwards of give the wheels greater control with more software			0
whether any of these methods will be more successful in future in avoiding damage remains to be seen			1
one of the main dangers has been ' caprock ' , flat areas of hard @entity19 rock ( shown )			0
in attempts to avoid going over these areas engineers have been trying to spot softer and sandier areas from the @entity78 currently circling the planet in other @entity4 news , the rover recently celebrated its first complete year on @entity19 , equating to 687 @entity133 days			1
this was done having accomplished the mission 's main goal of determining whether @entity19 once offered environmental conditions favourable for microbial life			1
one of @entity4 's first major findings after landing on the red planet in august 2012 was an ancient riverbed at its landing site			1
nearby , at an area known as @entity145 , the mission met its main goal of determining whether the @entity147 ever was habitable for simple life forms			0
the answer , a historic ‘ yes , ’ came from two mudstone slabs that the rover sampled with its drill			0
analysis of these samples revealed the site was once a lakebed with water , the essential elemental ingredients for life , and a type of chemical energy source used by some microbes on @entity133			0
if @entity19 had living organisms , this would have been a good home for them			0
the rover is now making its way to the foothills of @entity48 , its ultimate destination since landing on the red planet			0
this map shows in red the route driven by @entity5 's @entity4 from the ' @entity174 ' location where it touched down in august 2012 ( blue star at upper right ) to nearly the completion of its first @entity19 year ( green star is current location )			1
the white line shows the planned route ahead			0

engineers in @entity58 have seen a large hole on one of @entity4 's wheels
the damage is not mission - ending but could grow into a bigger problem
curiosity has been quite heavily damaged since landing in august 2012
this has surprised engineers and forced them to seek a quick fix
they are trying to find ways of avoiding further damage on @entity19
the worst case scenario is one of the wheels ' dies ' and has to be dragged
