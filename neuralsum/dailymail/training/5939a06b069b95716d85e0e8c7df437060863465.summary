but a family has beaten the odds and welcomed a third generation of twins into their family			2
@entity8 and @entity9 were born last wednesday to the delight of their parents @entity13 and @entity14 , who both 30			1
@entity8 and @entity16 with @entity17 ( front row left ) and her sister @entity19 ( front row right ) and @entity19 's daughters , @entity22 ( back row left ) with twin sister @entity24 ( back row right ) mrs @entity14 has twin sisters , @entity27 and @entity24 , both 21 , while her mother @entity19 , 52 , also has a twin sister @entity17 completing the third generation			1
although she was shocked to discover she was expecting twins too , mrs @entity14 revealed it had been ' predicted ' to happen			1
just two years ago a physic told her she would follow the same fate as her mother and grandmother giving birth to her own two little bundles of joy			1
she said : ' it ’s very unusual for three generations of a family to have twins and it was a complete shock to us , i would never have believed it if you ’d told me this a year ago			1
' i actually went to see a psychic two years ago before i was pregnant and she said to me that i would have twins and i was just like " uh huh , ok " because i do n’t really believe in all that psychic stuff			1
bundles of joy : @entity16 ( left ) and her brother @entity8 ( right ) who are the third generation of twins in one family ' when i did actually fall pregnant , at seven weeks i had quite bad morning sickness so my doctor sent me for an early scan			1
' they found two heartbeats in the scan and that was the first time i found out i was having twins			2
' we all had a good laugh about it - the psychic was right all along			0
' after the scan , mrs @entity14 , from @entity67 , @entity68 , went straight to her mother 's house to tell her the news			1
she said : ' we went down to my mum ’s house without telling her the news about the twins and we got the scans out and she did n’t realise at first			2
' she said " oh , you ’ve got two pictures here " , but we just looked at her and then it all clicked into place , she could n’t believe it			0
' everyone laughed when they found out , although my grandmother actually got quite emotional			0
' @entity8 , who weighed 5lb 5oz at birth , and 6lb 10oz @entity9 were born at at @entity88 , in @entity67			1
but , although they have settled in at home , mrs @entity14 admits they may have to find a bigger home in the near future and has already traded her small car for a larger model			1
she said : ' it ’s been lovely having twins as they have been absolutely brilliant - they are so well behaved , i ca n’t believe it			2
cute : baby @entity99 ( left ) and sister @entity16 who were born last week in @entity67 ' the thing i ’m most looking forward to is family holidays , so we can get everyone together and in fact we ’re going to be having a huge @entity107 celebration at @entity108 , just outside of @entity67			1
' there will be 14 of us staying in a lodge on @entity111 and @entity107 night and it ’s quite simply because none of us have big enough houses to hold that number of people			0
' however , this will cause a lot of changes in our life and we ’ve already had to trade in our @entity121 and now we ’ve got a @entity122 , just so that we ’ve got more room			0
' but my mum ’s been fantastic and my two sisters are being really good aunties			2
' to be honest though , the twins are behaving so well at the moment and are in a great routine			0
' the support has been really good as everyone is taking a very active role			0
it might have something to do with so many twins in the family			0
we ’re all very close			0
' bookmakers @entity136 said the odds of three successive generations of twins was 20,000 to 1			0
a spokesman said : ' the chances of three generations of a family having twins is extremely low and we would have to give odds of 20,000 to one on that happening			2
' it would be the biggest price on our website at the moment			0
