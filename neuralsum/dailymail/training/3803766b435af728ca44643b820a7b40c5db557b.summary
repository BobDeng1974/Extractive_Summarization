facing the axe : @entity1 had been appointed to run the school after it was put in special measures a talented headmaster parachuted in to save a failing school is facing the axe - because he is not a @entity7			1
the rule - laid down by @entity7 bishops – means @entity1 can not stay on after turning around the fortunes of @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
he had been appointed to run the school after @entity13 placed it in special measures last year			1
one parent of a child at the school , who did not wish to be named , said : ‘ it ’s completely contradictory and unfair			1
the school is the only one in the catchment area not full to capacity			2
' children are allowed to attend if they are not catholic			0
mr @entity1 has been fantastic for the school			1
our children are happy under his leadership and are progressing well			0
’ the school had been rated ‘ inadequate ’ in all but two categories while under the leadership of former headmistress @entity28 , who left after a damning @entity13 report last october			0
mr @entity1 was called in to mirror the success he had achieved as headmaster at nearby @entity32 , and was made executive headteacher of both schools last year			1
reports by @entity13 said progress is being made at @entity37 under his leadership , and it is anticipated that it will receive a good reception from inspectors due to visit in the coming weeks			0
but he now faces the axe after school governors said a @entity7 headteacher needs to be installed			2
troubled in the past : @entity10 ( pictured ) in @entity11 , @entity12 , had been rated ' inadequate ' in all but two categories while under the leadership of its former headmistress a spokesman for the @entity54 and @entity59 said : ‘ to maintain the clear @entity7 character of catholic schools , the @entity46 of @entity47 and @entity48 have stated that the posts of headteacher , deputy headteacher and head of religious education are to be filled by baptised and practising @entity7			1
the @entity54 expects all catholic schools in the diocese to follow this policy			0
’ mr @entity1 has insisted that he knew the conditions of the post from the start , adding that he had not been asked to leave the school yet , and would remain in his post for now			2
he said : ‘ i ’ve come in to help the school improve , which it is , and hopefully get it up to a good standard at its next @entity13 inspection in september or october			0
we do n’t know exactly when			0
’ but another parent said : ‘ we would rather have an outstanding headteacher who is not catholic , than a @entity7 one who is rubbish			2
this is about our kids ’ future at the end of the day , not religion			0

@entity1 told he can not stay on at @entity10
