by @entity0 published : 20:06 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 01:46 est , 25 april 2013 a big cat prowled the @entity3 countryside more than a century ago , rediscovered remains from a museum ’s vaults have shown			1
scientists identified the creature as a @entity10 lynx , a predator more than twice the size of a domestic cat			1
records show that the animal , thought to have escaped or been released from captivity , was shot by a @entity3 landowner in the early 1900s after it killed two dogs			1

records show that the animal , thought to have escaped or been released from captivity , was shot by a @entity3 landowner in the early 1900s after it killed two dogs			1
the @entity10 lynx ( @entity26 ) is a member of the cat family , @entity29 , and around twice the size of a domestic cat			1
it is a secretive and mostly nocturnal animal , although it may be active at any time of day			2
it usually feeds on snowshoe hares , but will also eat rodents and birds , and sometimes hunt larger prey such as deer			0
it is the first proven case of an exotic big cat being at large in @entity39			2
' this edwardian feral lynx provides concrete evidence that although rare , exotic felids ( cats ) have occasionally been part of @entity39 fauna for more than a century , ' said lead researcher dr @entity46 , from the @entity47			2
' the animal remains are significant in representing the first historic big cat from @entity39			1
' sightings of mystery ' beasts ' have largely been blamed on the introduction of the 1976 @entity54 , which curbed a growing fashion for exotic and potentially dangerous pets			0
some owners were thought to have freed their animals into the wild to avoid falling foul of the law			0
the new research provides further evidence debunking this theory , say the experts			0
in fact there is a long history of big cats being at large in the @entity39 , they claim			0
' you definitely should n’t scoff at people reporting eye witness testimonies of big cats in @entity39 , but these are rare events , ' said dr @entity46			0
@entity26 in the @entity76 is a member of the cat family , @entity29 , and around twice the size of a domestic cat ' if everyone who thought they had seen a black panther in the @entity39 countryside had actually seen one the population would be so large that we would see them all the time			1
' the jury is still out on the local big cat legends - until someone finds a body of a big cat , that would be the conclusive proof people are looking for			2
' dr @entity46 ruled out suggestions that the lynx , or a relative of it , could still be roaming the @entity98 moors as the ‘ @entity99 ’			2
he said the lynx is grey and is not believed to have mated , while the @entity98 cat is reported to be black and was only spotted many years later			1
although he said he is “ sure this will fuel speculation ” a giant cat prowls the area			2
how the lynx made its way to @entity39 shores remains a mystery but experts say it would have survived the by devouring rabbits and other small mammals			2
humans had little to fear from the usually solitary beast , which only attacks man if it is being attacked or captured			0
face to face : the animal 's skeleton and mounted skin was analysed by a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and researchers at @entity124 , @entity47 , @entity125 , and @entity127 universities and found to be a @entity10 lynx the carnivorous predator , which is twice the size of a normal domestic feline , is the earliest example of an ' alien big cat ' at large in @entity39 and will fuel rumours the mysterious @entity99 is its descendant a wild @entity136 , which usually feeds on snowshoe hares , but will also eat rodents and birds , and sometimes hunt larger prey such as deer			1
the lynx skeleton was recovered from an underground storeroom at the @entity144			1
records also unearthed at the museum show that the animal had originally been mislabelled by curators in 1903 as a eurasian lynx			1
the eurasian lynx was once an indigenous @entity39 species but had almost certainly become extinct by the 7th century @entity152			2
laboratory analysis of the @entity125 specimen ’s bones and teeth indicated that it had been kept in captivity long enough to develop severe tooth loss			0
dr @entity159 , from the @entity160 , who co-authored the research published in the journal @entity163 , said : ' there have been enough sightings of exotic big cats which substantially pre-date 1976 to cast doubt on the idea that one piece of legislation made in 1976 explains all releases of these animals in the @entity39			0
' it seems more likely that escapes and releases have occurred throughout history , and that this continual presence of aliens explains the ‘ @entity39 big cat ’ phenomenon			0
' colleague dr @entity181 , from the @entity47 , said : ' every few years there is another claim that big cats are living wild in @entity39 , but none of these claims have been substantiated			0
' it seems that big cats are to @entity189 what the @entity190 is to @entity192			0
records also unearthed at the museum show that the animal had originally been mislabelled by curators in 1903 as a eurasian lynx			1
it will now go on public display at @entity144 ' by applying a robust scientific methodology , this study conclusively demonstrates that at least one big cat did roam @entity39 as early as the edwardian era , and suggests that additional claims need to be subjected to this level of scrutiny			1
' the lynx is now on public display at the @entity144			0
@entity208 , head of @entity125 's @entity209 , said : ' @entity144 , galleries and @entity212 were pleased to be a part of this ground - breaking research , which not only highlights the importance of our science collections , it establishes the pedigree of our 100 - year old @entity136 and adds to our knowledge and understanding of ' big cats ' in the @entity39			0
' dr @entity46 , of @entity47 's @entity223 , said : ' this edwardian feral lynx provides concrete evidence that although rare , exotic felids have occasionally been part of @entity39 fauna for more than a century			0

researchers found the animal in a museum storeroom
scientists identified the creature as a @entity10 lynx , a predator more than twice the size of a domestic cat
animal though to have escaped from captivity in the early 1900s
