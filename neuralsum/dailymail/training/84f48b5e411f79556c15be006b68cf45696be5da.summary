but it is n't just women using the opportunity to expose some flesh			0
the latest research reveals that men are daring to bare more leg than ever before as temperatures across the @entity14 continue to soar			0
high street sales data has revealed that demand for men ’s shorts that sit at the top of thighs , rather than knees has shot up by a staggering 156 per cent in the last week alone			1
the thighs the limit ! sales of very short shorts have surged in recent weeks , could it be thanks to @entity29 who has been donning the designs in @entity31 and at wireless festival in recent weeks ? it seems that the trend has been spurred on by celebrities with well - known faces such as @entity37 ’s @entity29 and @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity43 ’s @entity42 , who all prefer the thigh - skimming option			1
spotted on the recent @entity46 catwalks of @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , this is one trend that has definitely made the leap to the great @entity14 high street , and looks set to continue			2
@entity55 spokesperson @entity54 , who carried out the research , said : ' we have all heard about the emergence of " mankles " – male ankles peeking out from rolled up trousers			0
well , this takes it to the next level			0
' all over the world , @entity14 men are renowned for exposing their white knobbly knees during the summer holidays			0
higher and higher : as temperatures rose at @entity70 , so did the men 's short length with @entity73 ( @entity74 ) and @entity75 ( r ) donning the tiny designs the only way is shorts : @entity79 , @entity29 and their @entity37 friends have also been sporting the thigh - skimming designs get shorty ! the ' @entity39 effect ' caused by football star @entity39 's barely - there holiday wear has seen sales of men 's micro shorts surge			1

flashback : debenhams say they have n't seen a demand for short shorts as high as this since @entity100 sparked the trend in the 1980s during the 19th and early 20th centuries shorts were worn as outerwear only by young boys and because of this , men would not wear shorts to avoid looking immature			1
in the 1930s , shorts started to be worn for casual comfort ( e.g. outdoor and athletic activities ) by both men and @entity126 , it was still taboo to wear shorts outside certain activities			2
since arpond @entity130 , when soldiers often served in tropical locations , adult men have worn shorts more often , especially in summer weather , but the perception of shorts as being only for young boys took several decades to change			2
by the late 20th century it became common for men to wear shorts as casual wear in summer			2
the 1980s saw the emergence of short shorts and there has been a steady rise in popularity			1
longer , baggier board style shorts were favoured in the 1990s but in recent years a tailored , shorter style has become most popular			0
