@entity13 understands that @entity2 is expected to be sidelined for between four and six weeks , ruling him of @entity6 ’s league fixtures over the next month against @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
with the manager 's fears now realised , @entity6 's record signing faces an uphill battle to be fit for the club 's @entity35 semi-final clash with @entity37 on april 12 as they attempt to end their nine - year trophy drought			1
the worst - case scenario is that he will also miss the april league matches against @entity43 and @entity44 , and will not return until early may			0
@entity2 is believed to have injured his hamstring in the opening 10 minutes of the second - leg , last - 16 clash at the @entity27 but carried on playing until half - time and aggravated the problem			1
he was checked by @entity6 ’s medical team during the break and also saw @entity7 ’s @entity54 team doctor @entity53			1
no chance : @entity56 opened the scoring for @entity7 with a neat finish game on : but @entity61 's equaliser had little bearing on the overall result speaking about @entity2 in the immediate after of the @entity10 ’ @entity5 exit , @entity20 said : ' he has a hamstring injury that looks quite serious			1
i do n’t know how long he will be out			0
for sure , he is out of @entity15			0
' we have to make a scan tomorrow ( wednesday ) to see how bad it is but he is out at least for a few weeks			0
i hope it ’s not too bad			0
' blow : @entity20 could be without @entity2 for six weeks @entity2 's setback is the latest in a series of serious injuries to senior members of @entity20 's squad			2
@entity76 will miss around two months with a foot injury sustained on international duty last week and @entity79 is out until next season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament			2
@entity82 is still not fully fit after being sidelined since december 26 with a thigh injury .			0
