climate change will bring greater extremes in weather , the government 's outgoing chief scientific adviser has warned			1
professor sir @entity5 said the effects of climate change on the weather were already being felt in the @entity9 , as he called for urgent action to tackle global warming			1
he also forecast there would soon be ' massive problems in the world ' , exacerbated by the fact there will be an estimated one billion more people on the planet in just 12 years ' time			1
' in a sense we have moved from the idea of global warming to the idea of climate change , and that is rather important - yes , indeed , temperatures are increasing but the thing that is going to happen is that we are going to see much more variability in our weather , ' he told @entity31			2

professor sir @entity5 said the effects of climate change on the weather were already being felt in the @entity9 , as he called for urgent action to tackle global warming ' i think you only have to look at the last few years to see how that is actually starting to manifest itself even in the @entity9			1
' sir @entity5 said there were ' massive problems ' in the world of food , water and energy security as the global population increases , all of which would be exacerbated by climate change			1
even if effective action was taken now on global warming , he said there would be ' significant ' climate change over the next 20 to 25 years as results of past global emissions			1

sir @entity5 said there were ' massive problems ' in the world of food , water and energy security as the global population increases ' we have massive problems in the world - in 12 years ' time there will be another billion people on the planet and we have big issues of food security , water security and energy security and many , many people will start to be living in cities , ' he said			1
@entity90 is warmer today than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years , research from from @entity92 in the @entity93 has shown			0
scientists studied fossils recovered from 73 sites around the world to track global climate to the end of the last @entity99			2
they found that for 70 per cent to 80 per cent of this period , which dates back to the start of the holocene era in which we now live , temperatures were cooler than they are now			0
the research shows that over the past 5,000 years the @entity90 underwent an overall cooling of around @entity107			0
but in just the last 100 years - since the start of the industrial age - it has warmed by the same amount			0
' these are massive problems ; climate change is just going to make it worse			1
' he said there were some ' uncertainties ' in the analysis of climate and climate change			2
' but those uncertainties are completely outweighed by the enormous body of evidence that shows it is happening and is happening in the sort of ways climate models would expect , ' he said			0
' for example the @entity126 is heating up vastly faster than other parts of the world - this is exactly what the climate scientists are predicting			2
' sir @entity5 's remarks were made as @entity9 experienced freezing cold weather and snow , with thousands of homes across the @entity9 without power and many roads still impassable			1
almost 8,000 homes and businesses were flooded in 2012 , as the @entity9 was battered by repeated heavy rain , storms and floods			0
@entity144 and @entity145 experienced 10 separate flooding events between april and december last year after widespread drought gave way to the wettest summer in a century , with unusually high rainfall totals and river levels around the country			0
sir @entity152 , currently director of the @entity154 , takes over as the government 's chief scientific adviser on april 1 .			0

sir @entity5 said effects of climate change already being felt in @entity9
he also forecast ' massive problems in world ' with huge population rise
there will be ' significant ' climate change over the next 20 to 25 years , he said
