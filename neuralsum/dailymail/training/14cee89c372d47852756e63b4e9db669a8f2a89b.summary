there will be a time when @entity2 looks back on his career at @entity4 and reflects on some towering performances			1
at the @entity7 on sunday , with the formidable presence of @entity10 striker @entity9 keeping him on his toes in a bruising and compelling clash , this will rank among them			1
@entity2 lives for days like this , captaining his team into battle and emerging with the upper hand against one of the most prolific forwards in world football			1
@entity2 put in another towering performance for @entity4 against @entity10 on sunday the @entity23 captain and @entity9 were involved in a titanic battle ... which @entity2 got the better of @entity9 was kept quiet by @entity2 , stopping him scoring his eighth @entity26 goal @entity9 had scored seven in his opening four games in the @entity26 since his move from @entity30			1
it was @entity2 ’s job to stop him scoring the eighth			2
the only thing missing was a win but , in the circumstances — down to 10 men after the dismissal of @entity39 — one point will suffice			1
if @entity2 had been on the winning team , no one would have begrudged him			2
this was a colossal performance , restricting the leading scorer in the @entity26 to just two shots			2
one hit the post , when @entity10 were leading 1 - 0 , but that was the biggest scare			1
@entity2 ’s timing was exceptional			0
he was immaculate , hooking the ball off @entity52 , @entity53 or @entity9 and then striding forward into areas usually occupied by @entity55 or @entity56			0
@entity57 was also impressive for @entity4 on his debut in @entity59 @entity2 gets the better of @entity60 during the crucial game between the champions and the favourites between @entity2 and @entity57 , making his debut for @entity4 , they roughed up @entity9 , trying to provoke the striker			1
someone , someday will make him blow a gasket			0
@entity4 ’s captain was ready for him in a clash that had threatened to boil over from the moment @entity56 was shown the first yellow card			0
that was 11 minutes in , with @entity56 cautioned by @entity74 for a reckless challenge that set the tone			0
in all , seven players were booked , including @entity9			0
@entity10 ’s forward was subdued , well short of the threat he provided in the opening four games against @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
here at the @entity7 he came up against two who have marked some of the best forwards in the world			0
no disrespect to the central defensive partnerships of @entity92 and @entity93 ( @entity82 ) , @entity94 and @entity95 ( @entity83 ) , @entity96 and @entity97 ( @entity84 ) plus @entity98 and @entity99 ( @entity85 ) , but this was a tougher test and he struggled to impose himself after his manager , @entity101 , revealed in the week that the striker is struggling with a hamstring injury			0
@entity9 was in sublime form before sunday , netting seven goals against weak defences @entity107 and @entity2 shake hands after the game , both were in imperious form @entity2 shares a moment with @entity23 team - mate @entity53 at the @entity7 a couple of years ago , when @entity2 was in his pomp , he turned in what is rightly regarded as the finest performance he has ever given in a @entity4 shirt			1
against the champions , @entity2 kept @entity120 ’s forward line quiet at one end and scored with a header at the other to set up a 1 - 0 win			1
two games later @entity4 were crowned champions			0
that is the target for this team , for @entity2 to guide them through this tricky period and make a fist of it at the top of the table			2
they have n’t won since august 25 , when the champions blew @entity135 away at the @entity7 and all was well with the world			0
that seems a long time ago for @entity4 , but at least @entity2 can still prove a point			2
@entity2 is approaching his form from 2012 , when he lead @entity4 to their first @entity26 title			1

@entity2 kept @entity9 from scoring his eight @entity26 goal on sunday
@entity4 and @entity10 drew 1 - 1 at the @entity7
@entity2 loves leading his team into the battle against the very best
the only thing missing for the @entity23 defender was a win
@entity57 also impressive on his full debut in @entity59 football
@entity2 approaching the form he produced in 2012
