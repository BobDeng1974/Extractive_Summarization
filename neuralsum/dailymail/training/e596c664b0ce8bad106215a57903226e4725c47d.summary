' @entity65 offered the cash reward in a move backed by @entity11			2
detective chief inspector @entity68 said : ' i would like to thank @entity65 for offering this reward and say again that local people hold the key to finding who is responsible for this terrible attack			2

' i ’m asking people to look into their consciences and if they have any suspicions about who may be responsible to contact police			2
' a shocking picture released by her family in the days after the attack showed the full extent of the appalling injuries mrs @entity8 suffered to her face			1
as her family appealed for help in finding her attacker yesterday , they revealed that mrs @entity8 , who is still ‘ very poorly ’ in hospital , has started to describe the awful moment she was assaulted			1

the beating was so severe blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed			1
the family have as yet refused to allow her to look in a mirror , because she was always so proud of having healthy skin and would be horrified to see her scars			2
mrs @entity105 and her brother @entity106 make their public appeal for information detective chief inspector @entity68 ( left ) described the level of violence as ' shocking ' mrs @entity8 ’s daughter @entity105 , 56 , spoke last week from @entity11 headquarters with her brother @entity41			1
she said : ‘ to see your mum viciously beaten and covered in blood has been the most horrific nightmare			1
it ’s broken my heart to hear my frail and defenceless mum manage to say she was screaming for help and no one came			2
’ @entity105 has made an emotional appeal to help track down the thug who brutally attacked her mother mrs @entity8 , who lives in @entity29 , @entity17 , worked at the city ’s small arms factory during the @entity129			1
she relies on a wheelchair to get around , and has lived alone since her husband @entity131 died in 2006 , aged 91			0

her son @entity140 , 65 , described on sunday how his mother had woken up in hospital after being sedated for a couple of days and asked desperately whether someone was trying to murder her			0
he said : ‘ i spoke to @entity145 and she seems to be doing ok , although her speech is slurred , which is worrying			0
‘ the first thing she asked when she woke up was , “ was someone trying to murder me ? ” ‘ she also asked medics if she had any scars because she has always been proud of her beautiful skin			0
we have not yet had the heart to give her a mirror so she can see the extent of her injuries			0
’ he added : ‘ these thugs need to be caught as soon as possible			0
they have no right to be walking the streets and should be jailed and the key thrown away			0
you could n’t print the words i ’d use to describe the maniacs who did this			0
‘ the problem is these monsters have no deterrent these days and they know about all the soft sentences handed out even for attacking a defenceless old woman in her bed			0
not only was she virtually deaf and blind , she also had a pacemaker fitted and had undergone two hip replacements			0
’ last sunday , police officers spoke to mrs @entity8 in hospital , where she is recovering after emergency surgery			1
she has been sedated for much of the time since the attack and had to have metal plates inserted into her arm			0
mrs @entity8 described her ‘ traumatic ’ ordeal to officers and said she was completely at a loss as to why she would have been targeted			1
detective chief inspector @entity187 said : ‘ she can recall the incident and explained just how frightened she was during this senseless attack			0
mrs @entity8 's flat in @entity29 , @entity17 , where she was brutally attacked as she slept ‘ like the rest of us , @entity8 is also really struggling to understand why someone would do this to her			1
she is not a rich woman and has lived in the area a long time			0
from what we can tell , she was also well liked by neighbours			0
‘ she was totally shocked			0
she ca n’t think of any reasons why somebody would attack her			0
she ’s lived in the community for a long time and she ’s still quite traumatised about that			0
we need to know who did this to her			0
’ police said there were no signs of a break - in and that whoever attacked her took nothing from her home			1
the attacker is still on the loose and police are yet to establish any motive			0
authorities are re-examining @entity219 footage from the area , while slowly eliminating names put forward by members of the public			0
@entity224 added : ‘ it is a unique offence , it ’s very rare , but the injuries suffered by @entity8 were quite horrific			1
the injuries she sustained would have been challenging for people half her age			0
‘ we ’ve had a number of names put through to the investigation team but the appeal still goes out to the local community			0
@entity8 issues an appeal to find the thugs who beat her mother			1
