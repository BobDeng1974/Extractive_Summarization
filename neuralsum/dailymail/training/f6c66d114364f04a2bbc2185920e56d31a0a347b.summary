a ‘ sacred ' path that may have led to a 6,000 - year - old henge has been discovered on a building site in @entity3			1
the ceremonial gathering place in @entity5 measures 98ft ( 30 metres ) in diameter and is formed of a pair of ring ditches			1
evidence suggests the outer ditch may have originated in the @entity12 period , and been later transformed in the @entity13 into a funerary monument , with the addition of the inner ring			1
archaeologists believe the outer ring dates to the @entity12 period , but was later transformed into a @entity13 funerary monument a henge is a circular or oval - shaped area enclosed , typically a ditch with an external bank			1
henges have either a single ditch , or a pair of concentric ditches surrounding a central area			0
however , some henges have been known to have no ditch , while others have three			0
access to the central area was through formal entrances and the majority of henges have either one entrance or two opposed entrances			0
the original purpose and function of henge monuments is not known , but they are commonly thought to have been ceremonial or ritual monuments			2
however , further analysis is needed to determine the exact date , phasing and character of these two monuments			0
the discovery was made by dr @entity55 and his team from @entity57			0
it is part of a larger , ongoing investigation on the site , ahead of development by @entity62 at @entity63 just to the west of @entity65 in @entity3			2
the rings are positioned on the north - west slope above the @entity69 stream that runs through the centre of the site			0
the outer ring has an entrance facing north - east , which suggests it may have originated as a henge - type monument , similar to @entity77			2
the inner ring appears to have been built later , and is an unbroken circuit			0
the researchers claim this may be associated with a @entity13 burial mound , known as a barrow , although no bodies have been found			1
a second smaller monument lies close to the larger rings , and experts believe it may have been a secondary barrow , also dating to the @entity13			1
while the monuments may have fallen out of use for their primary function by the middle @entity13 , @entity89 archaeology believe they would have still been significant landscape features			0

its purpose is not known , but the experts claim it may have been formally used as a ‘ sacred way ’ leading to the @entity12 henge			1
‘ the importance of the location in the @entity12 is bolstered by the rare findings of a series of pits close to the monuments that may indicate the area was being used before the construction of the monument or represents activity associated with it , ’ said dr @entity55 , from @entity57			1
‘ the investigation of the monuments is almost complete and the numerous finds and records of the investigation will be analysed to reveal more clues about these prehistoric monuments and their surrounding landscape , ’ continued dr @entity55			0
