every four years the warning sounds : do not buy players on the back of a good @entity3			1
every four years , however , such caution is duly ignored			0
and why not ? after all , these are players who have seized the chance to showcase their merits on the biggest stage of all			2
this weekend - at the business end of the competition - will be no different			0
skill school : @entity14 's midfielder @entity13 has been one of the stars of the @entity3 it is the proverbial ' shop window ' and there are no shortage of cash - laden customers peering through its glass			1
we have already seen players such as @entity14 's @entity13 catapult their star into another galaxy			1
but there are countless others jostling for position in the shop front			0
here , @entity30 runs you through those for whom this weekend 's quarter - finals mean more than simply winning a place in the last four			1
@entity36 ( v @entity35 , 5pm , saturday ) @entity37 ( @entity38 ) - £ 10m no teenager has made a bigger impression on these finals and , having come from the bench in each of the group games - scoring the winner against @entity46 - the 19 - year - old deservedly won a start for the last - 16 tie with @entity49			1
again he used his pace , power and raw enthusiasm to unsettle his minders and was unlucky not to add to his tournament tally			0
he has outshone @entity56 and , given his team - mate 's reputation on these shores , it is little surprise to see @entity62 clubs declaring an interest			0
@entity64 are chief among them , although a loan deal back to @entity38 is thought to be one of the conditions of a move			2
teenage kicks : @entity38 's @entity37 has proved to be a star for @entity36 @entity14 ( v @entity71 , 9pm , friday ) @entity72 ( @entity73 ) - free the agile @entity74 has conceded just twice in @entity71 and will again have to be at his best to deny the hosts on friday			2
after six years in @entity78 with @entity73 - he signed for them when he was 19 - he will move on this summer and @entity80 are said to be interested			1
after this tournament , though , @entity72 deserves to be more than just a back - up to @entity83			0
top of the stoppers : @entity14 's goalkeeper @entity72 has conceded just twice at the @entity3 @entity85 ( @entity86 ) - £ 35m the 27 - year - old has already said he would jump at the chance of a move to @entity80 and , with @entity91 reportedly willing to pay his £ 35m buyout clause , the striker could well end up in the @entity62			1
he scored twice in the 4 - 0 demolition of @entity94 in the group stage and his athleticism and eye for goal - he has 60 goals in 91 games for @entity86 - make him one of @entity102 's most sought - after stars			0
@entity62 bound ? @entity85 has a £ 35m buy - out clause in his contract with @entity86 @entity105 ( @entity106 ) - £ 30m @entity106 are n't daft ; after the winger 's impressive entrance to @entity71 2014 they moved swiftly to acquire full ownership from @entity110			1
since then his worth has amplified every time he has taken to the field			0
the 26 - year - old couples flair with fight and a willingness to put a shift in for his side			0
indeed , no wideman ran further in @entity121 last season			0
but @entity123 is more than just a marathon man , as his four assists and one goal at the finals testify			2
@entity128 and @entity129 have taken note			1
on the rise : @entity105 has helped @entity14 make the quarter finals @entity134 ( v @entity133 , 9pm , saturday ) @entity135 ( @entity136 ) - £ 8m the goalkeeper has undoubtedly been one of the surprise stars of the tournament , just as he was in @entity140 last season			1
the 27 - year - old has conceded just twice and was decisive in the penalty - shootout victory over @entity143			0
@entity136 are demanding that @entity144 pay the £ 8m buyout clause in his contract but others are said to be circling			1
no way past : @entity134 goalkeeper @entity135 makes a save in a penalty shoot out against @entity143 @entity151 ( @entity152 ) - £ 2m the midfielder has been key to @entity134 's journey to the last eight , a player who marries his craft to graft and is said to be the ' lungs ' of this enterprising side			2
his residence in the @entity161 league remains something of a surprise but that is likely to change after the finals , especially given that he is still just 26 years old			0
getting stuck in : @entity167 makes a challenge for @entity134 against @entity143 @entity170 ( v @entity169 , 5pm , friday ) @entity171 ( @entity172 ) - £ 25m we 've been aware of the talented left - winger for a while given his reputation when rising through the youth ranks - he also broke into the @entity172 side at 18 - but only now is his star coming to the fore on the international stage			2
he has thrilled at these finals with his pace and trickery , and that comes on the back of a 16 - goal campaign in @entity140			0
at 23 years old @entity172 are aware of his market value and it will take an offer north of £ 20m before they even entertain discussions			0
rising up : @entity170 forward @entity171 could command a fee of around £ 20m should @entity172 decide to cash in @entity196 : @entity170 highlights @entity169 ( v @entity170 , 5pm , friday ) @entity197 ( @entity198 ) - £ 25m the 24 - year - old playmaker is reluctant to commit his future to @entity198 - his contract expires next summer - and @entity128 are ready to pounce			1
another commanding display against @entity170 , however , may well alert some of the other @entity102 big boys and a battle for his signature could ensue			0
@entity207 are already among his admirers			2
wanted man : @entity198 's @entity197 is being watched by a number of top clubs @entity133 ( v @entity134 , 9pm , saturday ) @entity214 ( @entity215 ) - £ 10m the son of @entity215 legend , @entity217 , immediately caught the eye with two assists in the 5 - 1 win against @entity221			1
since then he has looked solid in defence and bright in attack , sparking talk of @entity225 taking him to @entity128			1
at 24 , time is on his side and a more illustrious setting then the @entity229 surely awaits , although the @entity232 champions will demand a fee of at least £ 10m			1
getting stuck in : @entity214 played a key role in @entity133 's win over @entity221 in the opening game @entity237 ( @entity238 ) - £ 7m the 21 - year - old defender has enjoyed a rapid rise through the ranks at both club and international level			0
he is equally adept at centre - back or covering at left - back and , given his tender years , a big - money move could well be in the offing			0
like team - mate blind he has been linked with @entity128 but @entity86 are also weighing up a £ 7m bid			1
rapid rise : @entity237 has caught the eye of both @entity86 and @entity128			2

host of players involved in @entity3 quarter finals may be on the move
*kroos* a target for @entity128 and @entity207
@entity80 considering paying £ *35million* release clause for @entity85
@entity128 boss @entity225 linked £ 10m move for @entity215 star blind
