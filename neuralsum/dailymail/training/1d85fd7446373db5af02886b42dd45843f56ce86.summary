a mother who set herself the task of visiting every @entity3 pub in the @entity4 has just reached a huge milestone - by drinking in number 500			1
personal trainer @entity7 , 55 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , has spent almost four years trekking across the country to visit the pub with the most common name in @entity4			1
miss @entity7 still has 120 pubs left to sup at before finally completing her quest to drink in all of the @entity3 pubs in the @entity4			1
here she is pictured at the @entity3 in @entity19 , @entity20 so far she has travelled a staggering 33,000 miles in her car , picking up just one speeding ticket and one note for bad parking			0
her ambitious hunt has set her back more than £ 12,000 but the mother said the journey has been ' completely worth it '			1
miss @entity7 started the adventure after noticing a sign in a @entity3 pub in the @entity32 which said it was the most common pub name in @entity4			1
@entity35 journey : so far she has travelled 33,000 miles to visit @entity3 pubs across the @entity4 , including this one in @entity36 , @entity37 she then made a huge list of all 620 pubs with that name in the @entity4 and started crossing them off one by one			1
the personal trainer said : ' i was drinking in the @entity3 in @entity44 and saw a plaque saying it is the most common pub name			1
' i immediately imagined hundreds of them dotted all over the country and came up with a crazy idea of visiting all of them			0
' my friends and family thought i was crazy at first but now they travel with me and some of friends have been to 60 @entity54			0
' and miss @entity7 has just visited the @entity3 in @entity55 , @entity56 , to take her tally to 500			1
@entity9 lion : this @entity3 in @entity59 is just one of 500 watering holes she has visited so far but she still has around 120 to go before she has completed her quest			2
at every pub she visits @entity7 poses for a photograph and usually downs her favourite tipple - a half pint of ale , meaning she has now drunk 250 pints			1
but she still has to visit the @entity3 pub in @entity69 - and is prepared to buy herself a plane ticket to cross that one off the list			1
all pints covered : her pub pilgrimage means she has travelled to drinking establishments as far apart as @entity75 in the north to @entity77 in the south - west			0
here she is enjoying a stop - off in @entity79 , @entity80 she added : ' it was a great feeling reaching this milestone and i only have around 120 to go			0

' i 'm trying to finish on grand national day next year - on the fourth anniversary of me starting my quest			0
' i have finished @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , but i still have a lot to visit in @entity93 and @entity94			0
@entity96 lion : the personal trainer , shown here in @entity96 , started her adventure after noticing a sign in a @entity3 pub which said that it was the most common name for a public house in @entity4 miss @entity7 pictured outside the ' @entity104 ' in @entity105 , @entity106 - the name means @entity3 in the @entity109 language one for the album : time for a snap outside a @entity3 in @entity91			1
the personal trainer says she still has a lot of public houses to visit in the south of @entity116 ' i 've still got to go to the @entity3 at @entity69			2
hopefully they 'll let me pop in for a drink , otherwise i 'll have to buy a plane ticket ! ' she has also collected a huge array of souvenirs including beer mats , glasses , pub t - shirts and menus			0
if the pub has its own accommodation , @entity7 often stays the night with her friends and family to get the ' complete experience '			2
@entity134 stopover : if the pub has its own accommodation , she often stays the night with friends another visit to one of the many @entity139 - this time it 's the turn of @entity141 in @entity142			2

and by the time @entity7 eventually finishes her pub pilgrimage she will have visited pubs as far apart as @entity75 in the north to @entity77 in the south - west			2
