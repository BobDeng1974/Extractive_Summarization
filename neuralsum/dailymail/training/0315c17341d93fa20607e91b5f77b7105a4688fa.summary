by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 11:59 est , 21 february 2014 @entity2 : 20:26 est , 21 february 2014 @entity3 , 66 , a diabetic patient at @entity4 who died after slipping into a fatal diabetic coma in 2007 just one senior nurse was in charge of 84 beds at scandal - hit @entity9 , a court heard yesterday			1
there was ‘ no effective oversight ’ at the @entity14 trust , which a major public inquiry said may have needlessly caused the death of 1,200 patients due to appalling failings in care			0
yesterday the full details of blunders made by staff in the death of one patient were laid bare in the first case regarding the hospital to come to court			2
@entity30 , 66 , was admitted after a fall at home , and was assessed by a doctor to be diabetic , @entity29 was told			2
but she was not given insulin injections after staff failed to read her medical notes and died ten days later after collapsing into a diabetic coma			1
the @entity14 trust , which has already apologised for the ‘ dreadful ’ care she received and admitted health and safety breaches , now faces a possible fine of £ 1million			1
however , campaigners say the fine will be paid out of taxpayers ’ money and simply hit patient care – and do nothing to hold managers to account			0
the family of mrs @entity3 have also made it clear that they would rather see those responsible prosecuted than have resources taken from the hospital			1
@entity56 , a solicitor representing families of those who suffered at the hospital , told @entity60 : ‘ they [ victims ] want a hospital where they can be assured that safe treatment and care is being provided			0
' they are not sure fining the trust will achieve that outcome – unless it can be pushed back into patient safety and care			2
’ @entity71 , an expert in health policy at @entity73 , said the trust was now a ‘ hugely toxic brand ’ which was struggling to recruit doctors and nurses			1
she added : ‘ it is absurd on the face of it for one public sector body to be fining another public sector body with no obvious benefit to the taxpayer or for patients			0
’ she called for a ‘ swift decision ’ on the dissolution of the hospital , which went into administration last april but a decision to close it has not yet been taken by health secretary @entity91			2
in court yesterday @entity93 , prosecuting on behalf of the @entity92 , said mrs @entity3 had been let down by the ‘ complete absence ’ of communication between staff			1
@entity98 has previously admitted health and safety breaches at @entity4 he said her death was ‘ wholly avoidable ’ and that overstretched nursing staff were ‘ set up to fail ’			1
‘ all the clinical and nursing staff were working in the context of poorly - led and poorly - run systems with no effective management oversight and control ’ , he said			0
it emerged that there was just one senior nurse in charge of 84 beds at the time , following a cost - cutting programme by bosses			0
the court heard mrs @entity3 suffered a catalogue of errors in three different wards			1
she was assessed on arrival in 2007 and described as a ‘ brittle ’ type - 1 diabetic , who needed daily injections of insulin to control her blood sugar			2
however , the chart monitoring her blood glucose level was not completed for several days , a referral to a dietician was never acted on , forms were not signed by senior staff , and the ambulance crews ’ record – containing key information – was never attached to mrs @entity3 ’s medical notes			1
the case has now been adjourned after mr @entity138 , the judge sitting in the case , said it could have ‘ wider implications ’ and he wanted to ‘ reflect on the submissions ’			1
' cure the @entity14 ' campaigners have repeatedly called for answers about the poor standards of care and lack of accountability , including demanding the resignation of @entity14 boss sir @entity150 he will now reserve sentencing of @entity98 to a later date			1
@entity98 last year pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules and providing ‘ dreadful ’ care to mrs @entity3			1
it was passed to the crown court as magistrates can only impose a £ 20,000 fine			0
to the dismay of bereaved relatives , not a single manager , doctor or nurse at the trust has been prosecuted for their part in the incident			0
two nurses , however , have been disciplined			2
@entity170 was struck off and @entity171 was cautioned for misconduct by a professional panel in july last year			0
in october , the trust finally admitted to management failures – three years after an inquest jury ruled mrs @entity3 ’s death was contributed to by low staffing levels and other systemic failures			1
@entity98 has already apologised for the ‘ dreadful ’ care mrs @entity3 received in the short time she was at the hospital , during which time she was transferred between three different wards			1
it has said practices have ‘ improved considerably ’ in the intervening years			0
mr @entity93 said the basic failings began right after mrs @entity3 was admitted to accident and emergency with a suspected fractured arm and pelvis following a fall on april 1 , 2007			1
mr @entity138 was told that an initial admission process had been carried out correctly , but failings in subsequent handovers meant key information about mrs @entity3 was not then passed on			1
described as a ‘ brittle ’ type - 1 diabetic , she needed daily injections of slow - acting insulin to control her blood sugar and the admitting doctor made a proper assessment of her condition , also setting a trigger level under which her blood glucose should be kept , according to mr @entity93			2
he said the admitting @entity205 nurse who initially assessed mrs @entity3 properly recorded her diabetes , her need for a dietician , and also came up with a care plan - proving the hospital 's staff should have been well aware of her condition			1
mr @entity138 adjourned the case saying it could have ' wider implications ' and that he wanted to ' reflect on the submissions ' separately , since mrs @entity3 's death two nurses have been disciplined			1
@entity170 was struck off and @entity171 was cautioned following a @entity219 panel found them of guilty of misconduct in july last year			0
in october 2013 , the trust admitted failing to properly manage and organise hospital services including its systems for record - keeping and sharing patient information between staff			2
the case was moved to the crown court for sentencing because the magistrates ruled their sentencing powers to issue a fine of up to £ 20,000 would not be sufficient , given the gravity of the offence			1
the current prosecution was brought three years after an inquest jury ruled mrs @entity3 's death was contributed to by low staffing levels and other systemic failures			1
the inquest also concluded that a failure to administer insulin to the 66 - year - old amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care			2
‘ however before these arrangements could be set up there needed to be a robust handover system , ’ added mr @entity93			0
she was transferred from @entity205 to the hospital 's @entity250 on april 1 , but by the time of her death in the early hours of april 11 , had been the victim of a catalogue of errors			0
nurses failed to give her daily dose of insulin on the morning of april 10 , and she collapsed and later died in the early hours of the following morning			1
among the failings , her fluid monitoring chart was incomplete , and records about food intake were contradictory - one said she was eating , another contained a referral to the dietician , which was never acted upon			0
her patient number was wrongly written from one form to the next , forms were simply not signed by senior staff , while on admission the ambulance crews ' record - containing key information - was never attached to mrs @entity3 's medical notes			2
in one case , the orthopaedic ward where mrs @entity3 was when she died was using an obsolete form which had already been phased out in other wards			1
a specialist report commissioned by the @entity92 concluded the passing on of information by nurses ‘ fell significantly short ’ of the required level and care provided was ‘ significantly below the right standard ’			0
it highlighted problems in information - sharing , hand - overs and record - keeping in eight nurse shifts and up to 11 drug rounds , over the period mrs @entity3 was in hospital			2
outgoing chief executive of the @entity14 sir @entity150 there is widespread anger at the fact that not a single official has been held to account for the failings at the @entity301 – in particular the outgoing chief executive of @entity303 , sir @entity150			0
he was head of @entity305 between 2005 and 2006 – the body supervising @entity307 – but failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care at the start of the scandal			0
when the report into the tragedy revealed that up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly at the trust between 2005 and 2009 , sir @entity150 insisted he was not ashamed of his record			0
his comments led to him being branded ‘ @entity326 ’ by campaigners and the @entity321 only one person has lost their job directly over the disaster – the former chief nurse at @entity4 @entity325 , 60			0
she was struck off after it was found she endangered patients			0
she made harsh cuts that reduced the number of nurses to dangerous levels			0
she also refused to adequately staff the @entity205 department , ignored warnings that patients were at risk and did not provide proper food and fluids for patients in the @entity341 .			0
