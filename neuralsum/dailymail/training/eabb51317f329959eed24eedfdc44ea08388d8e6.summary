@entity0 praised @entity1 for his match - winning performance as the @entity6 striker 's brace was enough to beat @entity7 in their @entity9 fifth - round meeting			1
@entity1 , who missed almost three months of the season after breaking his leg in august , reached double figures for the campaign as he struck twice in two first - half minutes as the reigning @entity9 holders eased into the last eight			1
the 28 - year - old remains an important part of @entity0 's side despite the summer acquistions of @entity20 and @entity21 - who started either side of @entity1 in a strong @entity24 side - and the @entity26 boss feels his compatriot is now a much more rounded player than the one he signed from @entity28 in 2012			1
@entity0 ( left ) has described @entity1 as a ' top level footballer ' after his two goals in the @entity9 the @entity31 ( centre ) scores his second goal with a neat finish at the near post ' we controlled the game from the first to the last minute , ' @entity0 said			1
' they had one chance at the end from a header , but overall i 'm pleased with the way we attacked , the way we defended and with the way we played together with a good focus for 90 minutes			0
' i believe that he ( @entity1 ) is a different player today than the guy who arrived here			2
he understands what top - level football demands , works with a great concentration in training and he has improved tremendously on his mobility , his technical quality and of course his body is very strong			1
he uses it very well			0
' @entity1 celebrates after scoring his second goal during @entity24 's 2 - 0 @entity9 win over @entity7 @entity1 put the game beyond doubt as he thrashed home @entity21 's corner with a well - taken first - time finish but it was his first strike , just two minutes earlier , which lit up the @entity67 on what was a run - of - the - mill afternoon for the home side			1
all 11 players touched the ball as @entity73 , captain for the day , threaded a pass to @entity75 to cross low for @entity1 to finish and @entity0 was left purring at the accomplished move			1
' the first goal is what we try to do in our game and our build - up , ' he said			0
@entity1 ( centre ) scores the first goal after a flowing move involving all 11 @entity24 players in the build - up ' the second goal shows that the game belongs to the players as well because it 's a consequence of two players who respond quickly to a situation , analyse it quickly and do what they want to do well			1
that 's basically what it was			0
it 's a consequence of intelligence and technique			0
' @entity1 's position as @entity24 's main striker had been under threat after the arrivals of @entity21 and , in particular , @entity20 but @entity0 insists if the @entity6 international is named in his starting line - up he will always play through the middle - with the likes of former @entity108 man @entity20 being accommodated elsewhere			1
' one of the reasons i bought him ( @entity20 ) is that he can play central striker and wide , ' @entity0 added			2
@entity20 started out wide for the @entity26 and @entity0 has revealed he likes his versatility ' i believe he 's doing extremely well and is contributing to the team very well			2
he can play central striker like he did for a long time but the most natural centre forward we have is @entity1			2
' all the strikers we have can play in different positions			0
the only one who can only play centre forward is @entity1 , so when @entity1 plays the others have to move out wide			2
' @entity7 had beaten reigning @entity125 champions @entity124 at the @entity126 to reach this stage - but @entity129 's side never looked like producing similar heroics in north @entity131			1
@entity1 's double knocked the stuffing out of the visitors , who had only one shot on target throughout the game , with @entity140 's clean sheet coming under the most threat in injury time as @entity143 headered @entity145 ' deep cross against a post			2
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity147 were once again impressive for the @entity125 outfit @entity7 boss @entity129 feels his side underestimated @entity24 after beating @entity124 and @entity129 thought his side may have been lulled into a false sense of security having already collected the scalp of @entity124 , as well as taking @entity153 to penalties in a @entity155 tie at @entity156 , as the second - placed side in the @entity158 came up short			1
' i think , especially in the first half , we have n't played in the way we like to , ' he said			0
' it is difficult to beat teams like @entity24 and if you want to take something from games against @entity24 today you have to be perfect , like we were at the @entity126 , and if you make mistakes it is difficult			0
' i 'm a little bit disappointed because everyone was expecting another game like we played against @entity153 or @entity124 and this is my biggest concern , we did n't go to the pitch in the way we usually go			0
in the first half i did n't like anything			0
' it could be that the atmosphere ( amongst the players ) was very exciting and everyone was expecting another win			0
the players maybe thought it was going to be easier because we played very well against @entity124 two or three weeks ago			0
' @entity182 ( left ) and @entity20 compete for possession during @entity24 's win over @entity7 @entity7 's @entity186 striker @entity143 ( centre ) holds the ball up against @entity26 new boy @entity189			1
