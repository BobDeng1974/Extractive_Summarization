' it 's hard to process this			2
but that was n't him			0
he was just a shy , lonely young man , ' mr @entity10 said			1

' to see him sitting there with that gun ... i just could n't believe that was my son , ' mr @entity10 said about the now infamous photograph of his son with @entity77 members			1
' they put him in a car loaded with explosives			0
they probably just shouted ' praise @entity82 ' or whatever , and sent him off			0
i ca n't imagine what he was feeling			0

' his revelations coming , as an islamic state propaganda website , geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by the @entity31 teenage jihadi , did anything but glorify the actions of the 18 - year - old suicide bomber			2

the extremist site sought to praise @entity10 but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice			1
‘ he started fighting in @entity163 against the @entity164 and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body , he was like a mountain , ’ the post , on a tumblr blog site associated with the @entity89 extremist group , said			0
it goes on to say that @entity10 volunteered for a ' martyrdom operation ' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission			1
earlier social media posts suggested @entity10 had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in @entity163 in @entity3 , but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet			1

in december , @entity10 reached @entity143 , a city located in central @entity3 , and said he ' made hijra ( or departed ) ’ in august			2
he was considered a well - educated maths genius , who dreamed of one day becoming a political journalist and even founded a children ’s soccer charity but by the time he ’d reached his 18th birthday @entity30 ’s mind had been warped			0
if you believe his tale of events - detailed in an articulate blog called from @entity31 to @entity143 : my @entity257 joined @entity28 fighters in @entity3 after years of historical research and a final realisation that ' i was growing tired of the corruption and filthiness of @entity54 society and yearned to live under the @entity28 with the @entity134 '			1
however , the picture @entity10 paints of himself – a scholar and a rational thinker – is very different to the lonely outcast that his former classmates at @entity219 have described			1
‘ at school he was a " loner "			0
he only really had two or three friends from memory but they were n't the type of friends that if he was in need of some help were good at helping , ’ a former classmate told @entity272			0
‘ he was obviously a kid that needed some help or guidance and he thought converting to @entity89 was right for him , ’ they opined			0
