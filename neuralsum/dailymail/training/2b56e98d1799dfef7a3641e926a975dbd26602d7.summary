by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 18:33 est , 6 september 2013 elegantly dressed , dripping with jewels and stunningly beautiful , @entity2 's pantheon of goddesses holds a special place in the heart of the country 's @entity8 majority			1
but one ad agency has turned the concept upside down by unveiling a hard - hitting campaign that depicts @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 as the victims of domestic abuse			1
described by commentators , including the team at @entity21 , as something that ' needs to be taken more seriously ' , the shocking images are intended to highlight the plight of @entity2 's most vulnerable women , including victims of human trafficking			1
appalling : this striking image depicts @entity13 , the goddess of wealth , as a battered domestic violence victim the text accompanying the shocking images reads : ' pray that we never see this day			1
today , more than 68 per cent of women in @entity2 are victims of domestic violence			1
tomorrow , it seems like no woman shall be spared			2
not even the ones we pray to			2
' although the horrific gang rape and murder of student @entity40 last december caused outrage across the world and intensified @entity2 government efforts to get to grips with endemic domestic violence , little is known about human trafficking			2
according to @entity48 , which commissioned the images to promote its @entity52 anti-trafficking initiative , trafficking of young girls and women for sexual exploitation is all too common			1
along with campaigning , the charity hopes to tackle the problem through its @entity59 , which helps victims of trafficking to overcome their experiences through counselling while also providing them with education and life skills needed to keep them off the streets			2
ironic : @entity14 , the goddess of good triumphing over evil , sports a black eye and a bloody lip in this image horrifying : @entity15 , goddess of knowledge and arts , also features alongside wealth @entity13 supportive : designers @entity77 ( left ) and lady @entity78 of @entity79 , a label - and cause - also supported by both @entity81 , the @entity81 and her sister @entity80 other initiatives include workshops set up to employ trafficking victims and give them a new future in the garment industry - two of which are supported by @entity89 founder @entity88 who has seen the plight of @entity2 's exploited women and girls first hand			1
' @entity95 [ @entity96 ] and i witnessed the effects of human trafficking in @entity2 2010 when we worked in local slum schools , and at an aftercare home with trafficked girls , ' she reveals			0
' it opened our eyes to this horrific crime , and we were shocked at that this sort of modern - day slavery still goes on			0
' it 's one of the largest crimes in our society today - more so than trafficking drugs			0
drugs can be sold once but human beings can be sold over and over again , it is an extremely lucrative market			0
' @entity79 works with anti-trafficking organisations @entity118 and @entity119 in @entity120 and @entity121 , which produce canvas bags and some garments for the label			1
@entity125 added : ' we launched @entity89 in 2011 to help provide a sustainable livelihood to those that have come out of sex trafficking			0
' the name @entity79 represents the journey of woman coming out of despair into a new life of hope and restoration			0
' we fully support the @entity139 campaign , and its aim to raise awareness of human trafficking			0
' the imagery is powerful and moving , and we hope it will help prevent and protect many women from being trafficked in the future			0

the images were commissioned by @entity48
the @entity149 has an anti-trafficking initiative named @entity52
among the deities is @entity14 , goddess of good triumphing over evil
