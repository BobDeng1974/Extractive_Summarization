a @entity1 photographer has captured some adorable images of puppies posing for the camera			0
the picture - perfect photo shoot is the handiwork of @entity7 , 61 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , who has decades of experience working with animals			1
he used both clean white studio backgrounds and comedy props to capture the heart - warming shots and these cute canines who appeared relaxed in front of the camera			1
a ' model ' poses in a makeshift hammock for a portrait by puppy photographer @entity7 the photographer also experiments with some unusual animal pairings , making his charming snaps the perfect way to celebrate @entity28 , which takes place tomorrow			1
@entity7 said : ' i use the studio because i ca n't rely on the @entity1 weather , i 've had to cancel shoots in the past , so using the studio and building a set means its one less thing to worry about			2
' photographing any animal can be tricky and with shoots outside there is more chance of the animal escaping or being frightened by the big outdoors			0
' i have very good animal handlers that i use , they have lots of contacts in the animal world and tell me what 's available at any time			2
some of his work is the stuff of dreams for greetings card makers , such as these four puppies in socks hung up on a washing line two tiny @entity56 's sit back to pack for this adorable , very wrinkly photo @entity7 applies the time tested ' baby in a bucket ' pose to a little puppy ( l ) - the photographer is seen on a farm with his camera ( r ) ' the hardest part is timing , i have to get each animal at the right age , so hatching eggs to coincide with kittens or puppies takes a bit of planning			1
' i 've found that the older the animal is the harder it is to get it to sit with another , when they are very young they do n't really know whats going on , and a ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy			0
' i never force an animal to do anything , so if they do n't look happy it wont look good in the picture and we try something else , or give them time to settle			0
some of @entity7 's ' barking mad ' animal pairings include this puppy and duck saying hello to one another			1
he says ' a ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy ' some are captured in a precious moment where they look tired or relaxed , sleepy or barely awake ' without giving away any trade secrets , i use sounds to attract them , they have to be soft for kittens but a little louder for puppies and others , or strange to get them to look at the camera			0
' all the animals react in different ways , so its quite often trial and error			0
' i love working with any animal , wild or domestic , its a privilege to be able to			2
' i hope they enjoy working with me , many of the animals come back to the studio for several shoots and they do seem to remember what to do , little treats always help			0
' a protective white puppy lays his chin on the head of a brown rabbit for this brotherly picture a playful pup sticks out his tongue to the camera ( l ) while another seems to be sleeping in a milk jug ( r ) many of @entity7 's subjects appear to be almost newborn - their eyes completely coloured and their fur still fuzzy , not yet silky a big brown pup protects a little furry chick ( l ) as a tiny puppy relaxes in a teacup ( r ) four little canines rest in blue and green flower pots as they pose perfectly for a picture @entity7 says he prefers taking photos in the studio - like this one - as outdoors , little animals are more likely to escape or become frightened a very soapy little puppy appears to be caught off guard as she ' takes a bath ' in this posed up picture cats and dogs appear to be best of friends in this adorable photo four fluffy dogs line up in a log crate as they pose for a picture a little pug looks curiously into the camera while standing next to a much larger companion			1
