by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 05:55 est , 1 october 2013 when artworks by famous landscaper @entity3 go under the hammer , they can expect to fetch well in excess of £ 20m			0
but now the beautiful countryside on which arguably @entity10 's most famous painter based many of works is up for sale at a bargain price of £ 1.75m			2
a total of 231 acres of land in @entity15 - just north of @entity16 on the @entity18 and @entity19 border - have been put up for sale			1
art history : the land for sale is near the village of @entity15 , whose church featured in @entity3 's painting @entity26 and @entity27 it features water meadows , lowland grass , arable farmland and fishing rights , so the new owner will be buying themselves a piece of quintessential @entity37 history			1
@entity3 's 1831 masterpiece @entity39 was bought by @entity40 in may 2013 for £ 23.1m and last year 2012 @entity41 became one of the most expensive @entity10 paintings ever sold when it fetched £ 22.4m at auction			0
so whilst the £ 1.75m asking price may be out of reach of many art fans , it is still less than 10 per cent of the price of each of those two iconic paintings			0
inspired : the @entity19 and @entity18 countryside featured in some of @entity3 's most famous works , such as the @entity55 water bargain : the picturesque land is up for sale at £ 1.75m popular : the land could well be snapped up by an @entity61 , as people from the @entity61 have a huge passion for @entity3 , the seller has said the land for sale even features in one of @entity3 's most famous works , the @entity15 , painted in 1802			1
countryside campaigners are calling on the @entity69 to buy the land to safeguard its future for the nation			2
@entity73 , president of the @entity74 , said : ‘ the land on the @entity19 side of the @entity77 was given by my family to the @entity69 in the early @entity79 and it would be a very nice thing if the @entity69 were to own the @entity18 side as well			1
‘ there is very little any landowner could do with it apart from keeping it natural because it is in an @entity88 and associated with @entity3 who painted in that part of the country			0
reel worth : whoever snaps up the land will enjoy 1,200m of fishing rights along the @entity77 plea : countryside campaigners are calling on the @entity69 to buy the land ‘ there are a lot of potential buyers who would be likely to appreciate the sensitivity of the landscape but if the @entity69 were to buy it , it would then belong to the nation			1
‘ the land - which is privately owned by a local farm - could even be snapped up by rich @entity61 who have a passion for @entity3 who was born in nearby @entity108			2
@entity109 , of @entity110 and @entity111 , which is marketing the land , said : ‘ @entity61 seem to have a lot of interest in @entity3			0
‘ we have sold a lot [ of land ] to them over the years around there			0
‘ we have two or threes potential types of buyers			0
we have farmer buyers who might buy it to graze cattle ; investor buyers who would see it as an investment for pension funds or other funding and the third sort , because of its location , will be interested in @entity3 himself and the history			0
’ whoever snaps up the land , they will be unable to make any great changes to its character because it is protected as it is within an @entity88			1
they will , though , be able to enjoy 1,200m of fishing rights along the @entity77 , 90 acres of arable farmland and 142 acres of water meadows .			1

a total of 231 acres of land on the @entity18 and @entity19 border is up for sale
whoever snaps it up will enjoy 1,200m of fishing rights on the @entity77
