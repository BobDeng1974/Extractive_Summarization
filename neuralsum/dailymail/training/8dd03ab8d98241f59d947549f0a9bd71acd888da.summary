@entity8 reached for her cell phone when the 11 - year - old boy , who has @entity12 's syndrome , became caught through a chair at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 last november			1
the footage shows that , as he struggled to free himself , @entity8 asked him how he became caught in the chair and whether he wanted to get @entity19			2
the school 's principal , @entity20 , was also in the room at the time and can be heard chipping in			1
they then sent the video to other staff when @entity8 tells the boy that a maintenance worker is on the way to help , @entity20 says : ' it 's not really an emergency in their book			1
' the maintenance worker then arrived to remove the child from the chair			2
@entity44 , an attorney for the boy 's parents , told @entity47 that @entity8 then showed the video to the class and @entity20 emailed it to other staff members and some friends			1
' you hear of bullying by other students and other kids in class , i have had cases like this before , but i have never had a case with teachers and administrators bullying , ' @entity44 said			0
hearing : the school board has voted to seek to fire @entity8 , while the principal has already quit support : many parents at the board meeting said they think @entity8 is a great teacher and not a bully it is not clear why @entity8 recorded the incident			1
her attorney has advised her not to comment			0
after administrators saw the video , the @entity72 voted to accept @entity20 ' resignation and seek to fire @entity8 by filing tenure charges			1
but the decision has upset some in the @entity79 , and numerous parents attended a board meeting on monday with signs in support of @entity8			1
' i know she is supported by the community , the other teachers , the staff , i have learned a lot from her and i support her fully , ' said @entity90 , a substitute teacher whose children attend the school			2
' i believe that @entity8 's intentions and motivations are always in the right place			2
' another parent added : ' there 's no way that mrs @entity8 ever bullied any child in that class			0
' scene : she is on leave from the elementary school in @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 they added that the word ' taser ' does not refer to a stun gun in the classroom context , but when you take two fingers and use them in a tickling motion on someone 's side			0
the parents of the boy said they were upset by the support she was getting , and said they did not like the use of the word @entity107			0
' our son did nothing wrong , but yet this seems to be another case of blaming the victim , ' they added			0
they are considering a lawsuit			0
@entity8 is on paid administrative leave while private tenure hearings debating her future at the school take place .			0
