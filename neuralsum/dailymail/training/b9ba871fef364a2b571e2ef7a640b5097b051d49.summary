by @entity1 reporter @entity3 sporting director @entity2 has not ruled out more signings to follow the capture of defender @entity6 as the @entity8 giants continue their summer rebuilding			1
@entity6 completed his move to @entity3 on sunday , signing a five - year contract at the @entity12 after joining from @entity13 for a fee that could eventually rise to £ 15million			1
the @entity15 international joins @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 as newcomers at @entity3 , who will be under the guidance of new coach @entity24 next season as they look to recover from a hugely disappointing campaign under @entity27			1
new colours : @entity6 with @entity3 director @entity2 ( left ) and vice-president @entity29 proudly show off their latest signing - and they could bring in more players this summer speaking at @entity6 's presentation , @entity2 admitted he was very happy with the talent @entity3 now have at their disposal , but also revealed that the club were still open to more additions if the right players become available			1
he said : ' with the addition of @entity6 we completed a defensive line of a very high level			2
there are options that we are working on for the exit of some player , as such we 're not discarding that others could come in			2
' what i can say is that at midnight on august 31 we hope to have the best squad possible			0
even though we are very happy with the players that we have , if there is a chance to improve it , we will try			0
' until the first or second ( of september ) , when we talk about the market being closed , anything could happen			0
' in the squad : @entity6 will wear the no 23 shirt at the @entity12 having signed a five - year contract new man : @entity6 was unveiled as a @entity3 player at the @entity12 after the completion of his move @entity19 - @entity64 - £ 9.5m @entity20 - @entity65 - £ 9.5m @entity66 - £ 16m @entity17 - @entity67 - £ 75m @entity21 - @entity68 - £ 15.8m @entity6 - @entity13 - £ 15m @entity2 preferred not to talk about specific targets , which reportedly still include @entity72 's @entity71 star @entity70 , while he also said @entity3 had not received any offers for right back @entity74			1
@entity6 was not short of suitors as it became increasingly clear his future lied away from @entity13 , with @entity78 one of the clubs heavily linked with services , but the 28 - year - old insisted it was a ' dream ' for him to move to the @entity12			1
' i 'm very happy			0
it 's a dream for many players to be here , and i 've achieved it			2
i will play with the best , i will train with them every day and i hope to improve			0
i will try and adapt as soon as possible , ' he said			0
' it 's one of the biggest clubs in the world , it 's a dream , as i already said			2
therefore , for a player like me it was n't a difficult decision to come here			0
' @entity6 , who @entity3 hope will help fill the sizeable gap in defence left by the retired @entity100 , struggled with injuries at @entity13 but the former @entity103 man hopes his fitness problems are now behind him			1
@entity105 : @entity3 could yet move for @entity108 @entity107 star @entity106 , with more business to be done he made only 13 starts in all competitions and 21 appearances in total for @entity13 last season , which concluded with him being an unused substitute in the @entity118 ' @entity117 final victory over @entity119 as they collected their first trophy in nine years			1
' last year was a little tough with all the injuries i suffered			0
i think that happens now and again during a player 's career			2
it could be a coincidence that they all happened in a short period of time , ' he said			0
' the only thing i want is to look to the future , regain my form and fitness			0
my aim is to play in lots of games and help the team			0
' i want to start from zero and i am sure i 'll have a fantastic season here at @entity3			2
