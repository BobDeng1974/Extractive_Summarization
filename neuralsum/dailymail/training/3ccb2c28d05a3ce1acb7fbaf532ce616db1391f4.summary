a 15 - minute test you take at home can show up the first signs of mental decline nearly as well as diagnostic exams			2
the written test could be used to help catch and treat @entity8 ’s early			2
@entity10 researchers who developed it say healthy older people would do the test at home and share the results with doctors so they could keep track of their condition			1
the test : @entity10 researchers say this home - test will be able to chart how older people are progressing the questions range from simple feats of memory – writing the date , for example – to more complex everyday tasks , such as working out the amount of change needed when shopping			1
other sections are more open - ended , with one asking : ‘ how are a corkscrew and a hammer similar ? write down how they are alike			1
’ more than 1,000 people aged 50 and over were given the test , and the results indicated 28 per cent of them had cognitive impairment , a mild loss of mental function			1
research : a study found the mini exam accurately identifies people with mild loss of mental function that closely matched the results of detailed diagnostic tests on the same group , suggesting the test could be a useful indicator			1
researcher dr @entity53 , director of cognitive neurology at @entity55 , said that it could lead to dementia being diagnosed earlier			0
he said : ‘ this self - administered test correlated very well with detailed cognitive testing			2
‘ if we catch this cognitive change really early , then we can start potential treatments much earlier than without this test			1
’ while the test does not diagnose disease , it allows doctors to easily track changes in a patient ’s cognitive skills by observing how their answers change over time			1
dr @entity53 added : ‘ we can give them the test periodically and , the moment we notice any changes in their cognitive abilities , we can intervene much more rapidly			0
’ earlier research demonstrated that the test can detect four out of five people with mild thinking and memory issues			2
around 95 per cent of people who do not have memory or thinking problems will get a normal score			0
participants in the study were recruited from senior citizens ’ centres , health fairs , educational talks , and free memory screening advertised in newspapers			0
volunteers were tested on mental orientation , language , reasoning , spatial ability , problem solving and memory			0
dr @entity102 , from the charity @entity103 , warned that anyone concerned about memory loss should see a doctor			0
doctors warn the test will not diagnose dementia , merely mild loss of mental function			0
it is still not known whether screening would be beneficial for @entity8 's patients he said : ‘ further research is needed to confirm whether the test would be suitable to assess and track changes in people ’s memory and thinking skills			1
‘ one drawback is that the test was not compared with existing cognitive tests			0
‘ it ’s important to note that the test is not designed to diagnose dementia , and people who are worried about their memory should seek advice from a doctor rather than attempting self - diagnosis with a test at home			2
‘ there is not enough evidence to suggest dementia screening for people who do not have memory concerns would be beneficial			0

questions range from writing date to working out change from shopping bill
others more *vague* such as ' how are corkscrew and hammer similar ? '
