watch : a message from @entity46 , @entity2 founder in march , the @entity159 company was forced to recall 17 per cent of its yoga pants due to an unacceptable ' level of sheerness ' created during the manufacturing process			1
at the time , the company said that it was not sure why the pants were so sheer since they had n't changed the materials used or switched manufacturers			2
the scandal damaged its reputation and reportedly cost the company over $ 20 million , and in june ceo @entity171 announced that she would be stepping down after five - and - a - half years			2
in a very stylized video for new yoga pants , lead yoga designer @entity172 delicately touches on the subject , saying : ' we saw that there was an opportunity to take the fabric and evolve it to another place			1
' fine details : the leggings , which range in price from $ 72 to $ 98 per pair , ' involved a lot of people to develop , ' says lead yoga designer @entity172 as the camera pans to a close - up of yarn and machinery revamped : full - @entity88 leggings ( left , $ 83 and right , $ 98 ) were launched in response to this year 's too - sheer leggings scandal , which reportedly cost the company over $ 20million full - @entity88 leggings , which range in price from $ 72 to $ 98 per pair , ' involved a lot of people to develop , ' she says , adding : ' it took over two - and - a - half years			1
' the camera shows a close - up of yarn and machinery as dramatic music plays in the background			2
' in developing it we had to look at everything from where the yarn was coming from , how it was being knitted , the construction , the mills that we work with , ' she explains			0
shots of women practicing various yoga poses in the pants show that they do indeed seem to maintain their opacity			1
@entity217 , vp of global product quality , explains in the ad : ' in the testing of the product there 's probably 13 to 15 tests that go on			2
every single lot of the fabric is tested before it leaves the mill. ' and materials innovation director @entity227 elaborates about the seemingly painstaking process of constructing the fabric , saying : ' we use special very fine microfiber yarns with a very special yarn construction ' still dissatisfied : one customer wrote : ' they pill and the thread in the seams loosens			0
i want to love these pants so bad			2
but honestly , my $ 15 @entity240 pants are way better quality ' later he adds : ' we made this fabric 55 different ways to come to our current formulation that would give us one of the best fabrics in the industry			2
' while the video claims that these new pants are made from a more supportive and opaque fabric , many of the reviews on the @entity2 website would suggest otherwise			1
one dissatisfied customer wrote : ' they pill and the thread in the seams loosens			0
i want to love these pants so bad			2
but honestly , my $ 15 @entity240 pants are way better quality			0
' another complained that the pants are just as see - through as their predecessors			1
