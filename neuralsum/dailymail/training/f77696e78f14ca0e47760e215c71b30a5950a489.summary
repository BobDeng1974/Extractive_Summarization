@entity84 , who shares a name with the fictional meth dealer from the @entity27 tv show @entity8 was found in an inpatient treatment facility after news of his coincidental name made national headlines			1
according to court documents , he was placed on probation in @entity167 in 2010 after being arrested in 2008 on charges of trafficking methamphetamine , unlawful manufacturing of a controlled substance , possession of a controlled substance and possession of precursor materials			1
the fictional @entity84 , played by emmy - winner @entity85 , is a mild - mannered chemistry teacher who becomes a ruthless drug baron to support his family after he 's diagnosed with terminal cancer			1
the show , created by @entity179 , stars @entity85 alongside @entity91 who plays a slackers former student of @entity84 , who team up to manufacture and distribute huge quantities of the drug in @entity96			2
it is currently in its fifth and final season			0
@entity85 has won three consecutive emmys			0
methamphetamine abuse is exploding across rural @entity11 as cooks find it increasingly easier to manufacture the drug at home or in make - shift factories thanks to increased availability of its main ingredient - pseudoephedrine			2
in @entity198 , for example , police say instances of ' meth labs ' being uncovered across the state have trebled in the last three years			0
pseudoephedrine can be easily bought over the counter in pharmacies in medicine such as @entity206			0
and while they may provide relief to cold sufferers , to criminals who are in the business of making meth , these pills are gold .			1
