an @entity1 property has a surprising link to @entity3 , played in the @entity5 series @entity6 by @entity7 , pictured the @entity8 inside @entity9 has played host to more than its fair share of royal history , and was the place where @entity3 ’s children – @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 – were summoned to be told that the @entity18 was dead			1
each of them went on to rule @entity21 as @entity15 , @entity22 and @entity16			0
and in the 1920s , @entity16 ’s namesake – our current @entity24 ’s grandmother – was also a regular visitor to the house and @entity8 : in her case to discuss antiques with the @entity31 brothers , the art and antiques dealers who owned the house until the 1950s			2
bizarrely , the room has not always been on its present site – tacked on to @entity9 , which is a delightful six - bedroom house in an acre of tranquil grounds with a tennis court , an @entity41 snooker room , outdoor pool and gym , all tucked away in a conservation area a short walk from the bustle of @entity1 town centre in suburban @entity49			1
where the room stood originally remains a mystery , but historians believe it was once part of @entity54 , a 14th century manor house nearby , which @entity3 had appropriated from its owner in 1539			1
and after @entity57 , the room was moved to @entity58 , which came to be known as @entity59 and on whose site now stands the town ’s department store , @entity62			1
to preserve the ancient treasures – which include a stained - glass window featuring @entity84 of @entity85 , @entity16 ’s husband – in 1928 the @entity86 moved the room once more , to @entity9 , which has been owned for the past 12 years by @entity88 and @entity89 , who are now selling for £ 2.8 million			1
‘ the original part of the house was built in 1530 , but the facade is edwardian and it was then that the snooker room was built , ’ says @entity88 , a former chairman of @entity90 , one of the biggest advertising buying agencies in the world			1
delightful : the six - bedroom house is a short walk from the bustle of @entity1 town centre in suburban @entity49 and is now on sale for £ 2.8million spacious : the house is in an acre of tranquil grounds with a tennis court , an @entity41 snooker room , outdoor pool and gym			1
pictured , the garden with its weathervale a stone plaque records @entity16 ’s visits to the @entity31 brothers in the 1920s – she was cataloguing all the royal possessions			0
for all its historic treasures and connections , @entity9 today has all the trappings a modern family would need			2
the kitchen / morning room , with its conservatory , is a vast , light room with wonderful views of the walled back garden			0
price £ 2.8 million @entity1 , @entity49 @entity127 unique features @entity129 ( that has been moved twice ) , snooker room , outdoor swimming pool , gym , tennis court four of the bedrooms are en suite , there is plenty of off - street parking , and the whole house , which is immaculately decorated and maintained , is virtually invisible from the outside world			1
the gardens are a particular feature , and include a historic treasure : the weathervane from @entity147 , the country seat of @entity149 , which was demolished in 1650			0
‘ you can sit in the garden on a nice day and you could be anywhere , ’ says @entity89 , a pharmacist			2
‘ you do n’t even hear traffic			0
’ @entity155 , whose estate agency is selling @entity9 , says : ‘ when i first went inside the house , i was blown away			2
this will appeal to a traditional buyer who wants a @entity161 rather than a @entity162			0
’ the couple , who have recently become grandparents , are downsizing but plan to stay in the area to be close to their daughter			0
