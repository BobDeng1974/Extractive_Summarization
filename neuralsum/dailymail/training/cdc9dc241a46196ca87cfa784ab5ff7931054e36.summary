football seasons can turn on small things			0
it will be interesting to see if @entity10 's @entity9 team are good enough to make sure that the key moment of a rather frantic game at the @entity4 still appears significant several months down the line			1
a goal down early in the second half on @entity16 , @entity9 were seemingly drifting towards another defeat in the @entity18			1
to all intents and purposes , they were @entity21 dressed in white			0
capable but low on confidence			0
it 's a lousy mixture			0
sent off by referee @entity106 on the advice of his linesman , the @entity105 's foot did appear to make some kind of contact with @entity9 's @entity38			1
still , though , a red card seemed a little extreme as indeed was @entity10 's subsequent assertion that his team would still have won had @entity28 retained the full complement of players			1
' yes , i think we would have won anyway , ' said @entity10			0
' we had a different attitude and mentality in the second half			0
we were better than @entity28 and deserved to win			2
' certainly the @entity9 manager deserves full marks for positive – if not wishful – thinking			2
his team had been wretched in the first half and probably should have trailed by more than an early goal from former @entity9 player @entity125			1
undoubtedly , the red card changed the game			0
credit to @entity9 for taking full advantage of it			2
@entity28 , meanwhile , perhaps need to understand that losing a player does n't necessarily need to be the equivalent of a football death sentence			2
they retreated far too much – both mentally and in terms of territory – once @entity74 went off and they perhaps need to reflect on that a little			2
in the short - term , however , manager @entity136 will feel a little hard done by as he reflects on this game and indeed on a run in the league that now sees @entity28 with only one win since the opening day of the season			1
' it was petulance and the letter of the law says it 's violent conduct , ' said @entity136			0
' but the really top referees use common sense			0
i think it should have been a yellow			0
' @entity79 is a 6ft 3in centre half but he has gone down as if pole - axed			2
' that ca n't be healthy for the @entity18			0
it is creeping in and it 's disappointing			0
' we are seeing incidents of players trying to get others sent off			0
' former @entity9 midfielder @entity125 ( right ) gives @entity53 the lead with a low strike from outside the penalty area ex-spurs man @entity125 ( second from right ) decides not to celebrate after finding the net against his former club on sunday afternoon @entity62 is mobbed by his team - mates ( from left to right ) @entity170 , @entity58 and @entity74 @entity28 midfielder @entity74 ( right ) brings down @entity38 in an off the ball incident during the second period referee @entity106 shows @entity74 ( no 25 ) a straight red card after he kicked out at @entity9 defender @entity79 a disgruntled @entity9 supporter holds up a t - shirt asking for answers from @entity9 chairman @entity177 @entity58 ( centre ) tries to get himself out of a tight spot after being surrounded by @entity9 trio @entity43 , @entity81 and @entity29 @entity28 goalscorer @entity125 ( right ) brings down @entity9 striker @entity43 right under the nose of referee @entity106 former @entity9 midfielder @entity125 gave @entity28 the lead with a low strike from 25 yards - click here for more in our brilliant @entity186 @entity136 was understandably frustrated at losing this game , which he felt turned on the dismissal of @entity74 in the 48th minute			1
referee @entity106 had to send @entity74 off , not because of the petulant reaction to a series of challenges the @entity194 made , but because his assistant , the vastly experienced @entity195 , advised him to			0
@entity106 had clearly missed the retaliatory flick out by @entity74 and the swing of an arm , neither of which was particularly violent or aggressive , so had to rely on @entity195 's opinion			1
the decision to dismiss was harsh on @entity74 given the context of how referees are approaching their task this season and given his clear frustration at the attention he was getting from @entity82 , @entity209 and @entity38			1
the incident clearly affected the players and @entity106 himself , who was then tested with a series of incidents - the clearest of which should have resulted in an obvious second yellow card for @entity125 for a late , reckless challenge			1
@entity136 's disappointment was keen and reflective not just of the sending off but that @entity28 should have been two or three up by half - time			1
having been brave enough to make six changes to his team after defeat at @entity224 , @entity136 saw his team play positive , vibrant football in the opening half an hour and they were ahead in only the ninth minute as @entity62 reacted first to a clearing header to advance and drive a low right - foot shot across goalkeeper @entity75 and in to the corner			1
@entity231 miles @entity28 103.3 64.2 @entity125 90 11.0 6.9 @entity63 87 10.3 6.4 @entity65 90 10.2 6.4 @entity9 112.3 69.8 @entity29 90 12.1 7.5 @entity43 90 11.5 7.1 @entity84 90 11.5 7.1 at this point , and for a good while longer , @entity9 were struggling			1
they were handy enough in the final third – they have some intelligent players – but poor when they did n't have possession and two opportunities that @entity28 created midway through the half were indicative of this			2
@entity28 's @entity63 was too alert for the @entity9 central defenders , bringing a superb low save from @entity75 from 12 yards			1
then , moments later , the visiting defence were on their heels again when @entity75 pushed away @entity74 's cross shot and @entity58 scooped the rebound over the bar			2
it looked an awful miss and @entity136 subsequently claimed it had taken a deflection			0
maybe that would explain it but , whatever the case , it was a pivotal moment			0
in to the second half and , after the red card , @entity9 certainly were better			2
from that point on @entity256 struggled for possession and conceded the equaliser when a @entity29 free - kick struck the bar and young @entity43 reacted well to sweep in the rebound			1
with almost half an hour left , @entity28 suddenly looked in trouble			2
certainly @entity9 could have scored again sooner as @entity81 saw a shot saved , @entity43 headed down and wide from close range , @entity85 was similarly wasteful and @entity84 drove in to the penalty area with purpose only to shoot high and wide			1
a winner did always look likely , though , and it came with a minute left as @entity29 received the ball from @entity83 before finding the corner from the edge of the penalty area			1
' this is a cruel league , ' said @entity136 afterwards			0
in the circumstances , that was something of an understatement			0
