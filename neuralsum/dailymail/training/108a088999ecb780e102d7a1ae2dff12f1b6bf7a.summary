by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 1 november 2012 as huge blasts lit up the sky above the stricken warship you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a scene from a @entity7 naval battle			0
but thankfully no shots were fired in anger when this former @entity12 @entity11 corvette was sunk by a team of engineers off the coast of the @entity16			1
the @entity17 , is one of four former warships that will serve as an artificial reef and diving site to attract more visitors to the area as part of the @entity25			1
it is one of four ships being sunk in the area to provide diving sites and artificial reefs professional : four ' cutting explosives , ' imported from the @entity43 , were placed inside the old ship as part of its carefully planned sinking a team of specialists had filled the 86m long vessel with ' cutting ' explosives which would send it safely to the bottom of the sea about three miles off of @entity55 , in the southern @entity16			1
the equipment was imported from the @entity43 and put in place by a team from @entity60 artificial reef ( car ) consulting , who specialise in this type of work			2
the group has previously sunk ships as artificial reefs in other parts of the world , including off the coast of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			2
the vessel had been carefully filled with 220 tons of concrete before it was sunk to ensure it came to rest in the correct position			1
sinking ships for use as diving sites is a skilled process aimed at making them as safe as possible for use by people and for the marine environment			2
ships are purged of oils , hydraulic fluids , and other dangerous chemicals and much of their superstructure is removed			0
the inside of ships are normally gutted of all parts that corrode quickly , and would be dangerous to divers if they came loose			0
some parts can be sold for scrap including materials such as copper wiring			0
sinking feeling : smoke billows from the ship 's funnel as it begins to take on water following the blast final moments : much of the @entity17 has been submerged as technicians look on at close quarters			0
the ship 's sinking was a carefully planned operation the end : the ship 's bow can be seen sticking out of the water as it begins to disappear			0
the corvette was filled with 220 tons of concrete before it was sunk to ensure it came to rest in the right position watch video here :			1
