he 's about to make the biggest move of his life , trading his long career with @entity4 for @entity6 club @entity5			1
and @entity7 looks just about ready to live in the lap of luxury when he relocates to the @entity10 of the @entity11 this summer with his family			2
one sprawling @entity16 mansion the footballer has reportedly viewed with wife @entity17 and children has been unveiled , an outstanding property overlooking the ocean which used to belong to @entity22 of @entity24 star @entity23			0
reportedly worth $ 25m - £ 16.8m - the luxurious pad is said to have been offered to the midfielder , 34 , by his new football club , who 'll foot the $ 20,000 a week ( £ 13,400 ) rent over the 18 - month period he 's signed to the team			1
@entity7 , along with his model wife @entity17 , 32 , and their daughters @entity59 , ten , eight - year - old @entity60 and @entity61 , three , are already said to be building themselves a £ 3million five - bedroom house on a two - acre site in an upscale area in @entity46			1
but that does n't much compare to their potential @entity6 property , which they could be set to move into in early june after the sportsman 's long and illustrious career with @entity4 comes to an end in late may			2
with six bedrooms and nine bathrooms , the swanky property also boasts sweeping mountain and @entity28 views and was regularly featured on reality show @entity78			2
@entity23 and her music producer husband @entity79 had the modern property custom - built to their taste in 2009 , and resided there with the 51 - year - old star 's three children , including model @entity86			1
the property , reportedly worth £ 16.8m , includes six bedrooms , nine bathrooms and plenty of living space @entity7 's new home is just a short 15 minutes from beach - perfect @entity93 @entity7 will be able to enjoy a spot of billiards in his games area - which comes complete with a bar located in the resplendent area of @entity101 in @entity16 , near to @entity102 and just a short 15 minutes from beach - perfect @entity93 , it seems the @entity7 family will have lots to keep them occupied over the next year and a half			1
the large house also includes separate exercise , massage and sauna areas inside , and also a magnificent infinity pool outside			0
there 's a sizable barbecue area too , and a garage big enough for three cars , housed in its own private orchards of citrus and avocado trees			0
the stylish home also includes a screening room for those big - movie moments , and a ' sports room ' , with a full - sized billiards table and bar , for when @entity7 wants to forget about football after work and let his proverbial hair down			1
the house is perfect for entertaining , and @entity6 reality star @entity23 had a professional chef ’s kitchen build with a custom floor - to - ceiling glass refrigerator			0
one of the bedrooms in particular opens up into a stunning panorama of the ocean @entity7 ( left ) will be hoping to end his @entity4 career on a high by winning the @entity137 this season @entity7 follows in @entity139 's footsteps who played for @entity5 between 2007 - 2012 in the official pictures of the impressive property , it is clear it 's finished to an incredibly high standard , a combination of both contemporary and classic design , with a deluxe @entity150 and certainly @entity149 - style vibe			1
it 's going to be a huge adjustment process for both @entity7 and his family , but he 's not the first @entity155 footballer to make such a move : @entity139 famously left @entity157 to play with @entity5 back in 2007 , and he moved his entire family out to @entity29 for the job			1
the @entity161 team recently confirmed @entity7 's signing following his decision to turn down the offer of a contract extension and leave @entity4 after 17 years with his beloved team			1
' football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years , ' he said on confirming his move			0
' i 'm not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself			0
i 'm going over there to win , and if i win and play well , then my life becomes more enjoyable			0
' there 's obviously a bonus of where the @entity5 are located as well			2
that will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different			0
' @entity7 scored twice from the penalty spot during @entity4 's foundation charity match on sunday and a senior @entity5 official confirmed : ' the club is helping @entity7 and @entity17 with every imaginable aspect of their family move and we are obviously hoping to get them settled as soon as possible			1
' @entity17 returned to @entity4 last month after jetting to @entity29 in search of a new home for her , her husband and their adorable girls			2
tweeting shortly before she returned , she wrote : ' last day in @entity29 coming home tonight ! ! @entity197 for lunch then last few bits of shopping , looking forward to seeing my man and girls			0
' and it seems like the move ca n't come quick enough for the @entity7 family			0
@entity17 , who has been married to the footballer since 2007 , recently tweeted her disdain for the typical @entity155 rain , something she surely wo n't miss when moving to sunny @entity150 in june			0
' wish this rain would do one ! ! ! ' she wrote on @entity213 while watching her man play in the all - star charity match at @entity4 's @entity216 on sunday			1
@entity217 has contacted a representative for @entity7 and is awaiting comment			0
@entity7 and wife @entity17 , pictured last year in @entity221 , are excited to be moving to sunshine - drenched @entity150			2

@entity7 will be leaving @entity4 at the end of the season
