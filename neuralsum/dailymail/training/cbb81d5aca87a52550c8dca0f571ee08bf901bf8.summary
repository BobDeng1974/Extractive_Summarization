@entity0 will turn down the chance to join @entity2 and sign a new three year contract with @entity4			1
the 30 - year - old was heading for the @entity7 exit this summer after an impasse over contract talks allowed @entity2 to step in and offer the @entity13 international a @entity11 transfer			1
@entity0 was free to talk to foreign clubs as his @entity4 deal was due to expire in july			1
@entity0 in action against @entity17 during the @entity19 clash with @entity20 at @entity7 on saturday @entity21 and @entity22 also showed interest but @entity2 were most keen and @entity0 was interested after hearing good reports back from former @entity13 teammate @entity25			1
@entity4 had looked unlikely to return to the negotiating table until manager @entity27 intervened			2
he called in @entity0 for a chat about his future and insisted he still had a role to play			2
@entity27 is wary that the loss of @entity32 will leave him short of experienced players in the dressing room while recent success playing a 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 system has reaffirmed his belief that formation would suit @entity0 's attributes better			2
@entity0 , set to sign a new three - year - deal at @entity4 , clears the ball during the 0 - 0 draw with @entity20 after speaking with the manager at length , @entity0 has been convinced he can continue his career at @entity7			1
@entity27 said : ' the intention will be to keep everyone â€“ we ca n't have three or four leaving next season			2
@entity32 will obviously be a loss			0
when you are losing someone of that calibre of man and player it would be a loss to any club			0
' for the younger players to develop their potential they are going to need that seniority around them			0
you ca n't just have a whole group of young players			0
the @entity13 international pumps his fist having scored against @entity68 back in november @entity0 , heading in against @entity68 , has only made 15 appearances for the @entity7 club so far this season ' @entity71 is not the marauding full - back of six or seven years ago but he is still a quality player and he has a lot to offer with his experience			1
his game will adapt over the next couple of years and we want to keep him			0
' like every player he will want that security and to get it sorted earlier than it is now , but when he looks at it and realises he is at one of the biggest clubs in the world , with a team which is developing and growing , he would want to be a part of that			0
' i know the club and his agents spoke towards the beginning of the season and i am hopeful we can find a solution and he will stay			0
