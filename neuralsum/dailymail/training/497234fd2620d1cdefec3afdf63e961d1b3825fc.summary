' by 25 , miss @entity7 weighed more than 20st and her health was suffering			1
she said : ' i huffed and puffed everywhere i went but it did n't stop me eating			0
' in 2008 , miss @entity7 ' partner moved in and after a hard day 's work , they found it easier to grab a pizza or @entity68 than prepare a healthy meal			1
miss @entity7 said : ' i made sure our son , @entity70 , ate healthily , but @entity8 and i continued to eat junk			1
miss @entity7 ditched the takeaways and in march 2012 she joined her local @entity76 class			2

mr @entity8 before , ( left ) , and after ( right ) his transformation : he offered to show his support by eating the same low - calories meals as @entity7 then joined @entity76 too ' but i 'd always loved food and when i realised it would mean i would never be able to eat properly again , i said no.

so i decided to try and lose weight on my own			2
' miss @entity7 ditched the takeaways and in march 2012 she joined her local @entity76 class			2

i 'd always thought it would be hard work and i 'd never be a normal size			0
i guess i 'd accepted my lot			0
' mr @entity160 ( left , before his diet , right with son @entity70 ) lost 7st 5lbs and reached his goal weight , 13st 9lbs but the couple spurred each other on , and as the weight fell off , they even started exercising			1
