by @entity0 @entity3 presenters @entity1 and @entity4 have sparked controversy after stunting a crash at the scene of a horrific car accident which killed a woman			1
@entity10 , 26 , died in a head - on collision with a newly - qualified driver who skidded on black ice at the bend on the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
but this afternoon , the @entity19 's hit show used the site - a few miles from @entity1 's @entity17 home - as the stage for a stunt , resulting in a dramatic crash which will be screened later this year			1
dramatic : @entity3 presenter @entity4 was flown into a ditch in @entity16 , @entity17 , after staging a crash with @entity1 at a bend in the road where a 26 - year - old woman was killed four years ago tragic : @entity10 ( left ) was killed when a newly - qualified driver skidded on black ice , hitting her @entity34 head - on in january 2010			1
it was just a few miles from @entity1 's @entity17 home however , the move has drawn concerns from some local figures , including @entity42 councillor @entity41 , who used to rehabilitate boy racers			2
she said : ' it is reckless and insensitive to use this spot for a stunt			2
' there are plenty of places in @entity17 to stage a stunt			0
to do it at the scene of a crash is insensitive towards the family			0
' the show is a very amusing one , but something like this is very serious			0
' from working with boy racers , i know this kind of thing glamorises it so it is dangerous - and upsetting for relatives			0
' my heart goes out to the family			0
' meanwhile , fellow @entity42 councillor @entity69 added : ‘ it ’s very insensitive and extremely silly and crass of them			0
’ the stunt saw may plough his silver @entity34 into @entity1 's black model of the same car - metres away from the scene where ms @entity10 suffered fatal head injuries in her @entity34			1
stunt : the stunt saw @entity4 may plough his silver @entity34 into @entity1 's black model of the same car crash : @entity1 and @entity4 survey the damage to their vehicles following the stunt this afternoon made for tv : police refused to be involved in the stunt which was filmed by the @entity19 for the hit - show with the tv cameras rolling , a crash recovery truck arrived at the scene and may ’s dented car was hauled out of the ditch while @entity1 ’s convertible was towed out of the crop field			1
pictures show @entity1 and may scratching their heads just minutes after the stunted crash			0
@entity1 ’s hard - top convertible was left with front wing damage in the collision while may ’s had to be towed away from the scene			2
it is believed the decision to film the stunt at the tragic crash site was in no way intentional			1
recovery : with the tv cameras rolling , may 's dented car was hauled out of the ditch by a recovery truck controversy : @entity4 has previously said he would ' carpet - bomb ' the @entity17 town if he had the power however , a @entity19 spokesman for @entity3 tonight refused to comment on the stunted crash and the fact it was staged at the same spot where miss @entity10 was killed			1
' i am quite happy with a ' declined to comment ' response , ' the spokesman said			0
the stunt was filmed only a few miles from @entity1 ’s @entity17 home and just a short distance from @entity130 , where @entity4 was photographed two months ago , with his broken down car on a roundabout			2
may is previously on record as saying that it he ever came to power , he would immediately ' carpet - bomb ' the quaint @entity17 town .			0
