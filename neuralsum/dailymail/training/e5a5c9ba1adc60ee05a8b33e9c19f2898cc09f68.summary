the @entity1 @entity0 has approved what promises to be be the first commercialized biotech apple , a fruit that resists browning after it 's been cut open or bruised			1
the @entity7 administration 's decision came as a surprise to many since the @entity0 rejected efforts by the organic industry and other critics of genetically modified plants – including environmental groups – to block the new fruit from the consumer marketplace			1
the @entity0 's @entity17 approved the planting of two gmo varieties grown by the @entity21 company @entity20 on friday			1
the company triumphantly distributed a 30 - second time lapse video that shows its new product alongside an ordinary apple as 24 hours tick by			1
one half - apple turns brown			2
the other remains yellow and appetizing			0
' all we 've done is reduce the expression of a single enzyme , company president @entity50 said in a statement			2
' there are no novel proteins in @entity44 fruit and their nutrition and composition is equivalent to their conventional counterparts			0
he called the @entity0 approval ' a monumental occasion			0
' ' it is the biggest milestone yet for us , and we ca n't wait until they 're available for consumers , ' he said in a statement			0
@entity50 said @entity44 apples will first be available in late 2016 in small quantities , and it will take many years before the apples are widely distributed			2
he anticipates a ' slow but steady market introduction , ' he said			0
' our focus is working with growers to get trees in the ground			0
' the new @entity41 apples have drawn opposition from environmentalists and organic - only food advocates			1
the @entity82 , a lobby group funded by organic food and cosmetics companies , petitioned the @entity0 to deny approval			1
that group claims genetic changes that prevent browning could be harmful to human health , and also alleges that pesticide levels on the apples could be excessive			2
@entity82 director @entity92 , a long - time purveyor of fright in food politics , said friday that he plans to pressure food retailers and distributors not to sell the apples ' this whole thing is just another big experiment on humans for no good reason , ' he said			1
the @entity0 said it had determined the apples were ' unlikely to pose a plant pest risk to agriculture ' and they are ' not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment			0
' the law only allows the agency 's decision to be based on its analysis of the plant pest risk to agriculture or other plants in the @entity1			1
but there has been no scientifically documented and reproducible study that shows human health harms from @entity118			0
the @entity0 has approved the planting of the @entity120 and @entity44 ( shown ) varieties of the fruit , grown from seeds containing genes that have been pinpoint - modified in a laboratory new plantings have been approved and the fruit could hit grocery stores as early as the fall of 2016 the @entity130 , which monitors new food technologies from a human health standpoint , has no mandatory review process for genetically engineered foods			1
@entity41 is embracing a voluntary consultation with the agency , however			0
the @entity137 is another group that has a problem with @entity118			0
named in a way that often causes name - confusion with the government 's @entity142 , the organization is funded by donations from large foundations that often bankroll environmental groups			1
in the case of @entity118 , their millions have seen little impact			0
' we think there are some possible risks that were not adequately considered , ' the center 's @entity151 told @entity156			0
but @entity41 said in a statement its apples have undergone ' rigorous review , ' and are ' likely the most tested apples on the planet			0
' apples have been the subject of intense food fears before			2
in 1989 a scandal erupted over @entity166 , a ripening agent made by the @entity169 company that was sprayed on the fruit			2
1989 : ' @entity171 ' demonized a ripening agent chemical sprayed on on apples called @entity166 ; while a green group reaped a financial windfall , apple growers suffered from the overblown report growers were forced to stop using the chemical after a television expose that claimed it was harmful to children 's health			1
' the most potent cancer - causing agent in our food supply is a substance sprayed on apples to keep them on the trees longer and make them look better , ' the late @entity184 intoned on 20/20			1
' that 's the conclusion of a number of scientific experts , and who is most at risk ? children who may someday develop cancer			0
' for weeks apples sat rotting on grocers ' shelves and thousands of fruit growers took a financial hit nearly $ 10 million in federal aid went to compensate some of them , and hundreds of school districts banned apples from cafeteria lunches			1
the @entity211 later revealed that the name - and - shame scheme was a project of a @entity215 public relations firm called @entity216 , which used it to benefit the @entity218 and other green groups			1
a 1 - 900 phone number on the screen during the @entity223 broadcast helped the environmental charity raise money thruogh toll - call fees			2
the @entity218 had already petitioned the @entity227 to ban @entity166 , but the @entity227 had rejected its scientific evidence three weeks before the broadcast aired .			0

@entity231 groups and organic - only food advocates had pushed hard for the techno - fruit to be rejected
two varieties of the ' @entity33 ' are identical to ordinary fruit with the exception of a single gene splice that stops oxidation when it 's cut open
furor is *reminiscent* of 1989 ' alar - on - apples ' scam that nearly *collapsed* the @entity1 apple industry in a *fundraising* scheme for an environmental group
new fruit could be on grocers ' shelves as soon as the fall of 2016
