where once women worried about bad hair days increasingly i see women fret about bad body days			2
nothing is right about them , let alone a little un-tameable hair			0
body image research i did previously revealed over 2/3s of women worry about lumps and bumps , size and shape , and so on			2
and this situation is worsening with many confessing they 're forever comparing their bodies to other women 's			1
hardly surprising when we have a tidal wave of perfect - looking , airbrushed celebrities , models , pop stars , etc. , arriving daily on our smartphones , tablets , pcs and televisions			2
body - envy is a game you never win as your self - esteem is chipped away			1

body - envy probably is n't a real concern for your self - esteem but look at your yes answers and how you might tackle them with the advice below			1
4 – 7 @entity55 answers : @entity115 you spend precious time and energy focusing on other women 's figures			2
this can become a cycle that feeds itself - you envy a colleague 's , friend 's , or celebrity 's figure and then look at yourself thinking i can never live up to them , and so on			1
put the advice below to work before you seriously damage your self - esteem			1
8 – 12 @entity55 answers : @entity131 not only do so many yes answers suggest body - envy is damaging your self - esteem and body image but it 'll also damage your relationships with other women			1
this great big cloud of envy blocks out appreciating their personalities and inner qualities - as you should appreciate your own			2
beginning with yourself become actively aware each time you think about your body			2
it 's worth keeping a record [ even in simple counting - form ] for a few days about how often you do			2
it may be an eye - opener			0
use a motto to challenge these negative body - thoughts , e.g. , ' i 'm so much more than my body			2
' dr @entity0 's book can help combat low self - esteem issues identify your hot - spots – things that start the self - criticising chain reaction			1
do you hate your body when you 've had too big a meal , when shopping for clothes , when around a friend / colleague who has a good figure ? know your ' enemy ' and prepare for these			0
prepare by talking yourself up			0
for instance , tell yourself your friend ( with the good figure ) would hate knowing you feel bad about yourself when in her company			0
talking yourself up with common sense calms down troubled feelings of envy			0
focus outward on the good things in your life that matter more than lumps or bumps			0
and focus inward on you who are so much more than your waist size			0
yes , easily said but it 's in your power to focus your mind instead of letting it control you with thoughts of body - envy			1
feeling fit combats body - envy			1
feel invigorated with regular walks , swims , the gym , salsa classes , etc. @entity193 , mind your posture – stand tall , pull in your core muscles and see how good it feels			0
everyone , no matter size and shape , feels better when fit			0
now you see other women 's figures as a threat			0
overcome this irrational thinking by questioning it			0
how are they a threat ? how does a woman having a good figure affect your life ? the honest answers are they do n't affect your life			0
mind your language – when talking about other women stop yourself discussing their figures			0
be aware of conversations slipping into shallow territory about someone 's looks			0
stop revelling in someone putting on weight and being aware when you react negatively to someone just because you think they 're better looking			0
you do n't have to ' emotionalise ' everything so , e.g. , take a so - what attitude if an attractive woman is on tv / movie when your partner 's around			2
rationalise it - he 's not going to run off with an actress , is he ? this may seem impossible when eaten up with body - envy , but learn not to care when a colleague has a great figure – and even be happy for a friend who does			1
remind yourself it is no reflection on you			0
finally , if you ca n't break the body - envy trap consider confidence and self - esteem coaching or counselling			1
life is short , you are unique , and you need to break free of this damaging thinking and behaviour			0
