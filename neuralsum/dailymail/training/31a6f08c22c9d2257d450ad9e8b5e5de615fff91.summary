by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity2 described @entity4 ’s thrilling cup win over @entity5 as ‘ embarrassing ’			1
@entity6 saved two penalties to send @entity4 into the second round of the @entity9 after a 12 - goal thriller against their @entity12 opponents			1
@entity6 denied @entity13 and @entity14 in the shootout as the championship new boys were pushed all the way in the @entity9 ’s first 6 - 6 draw on the move : @entity20 looks to get things going for @entity5 in the cup clash euphoria : @entity24 celebrates putting @entity4 5 - 4 ahead in an enthralling encounter at @entity26 @entity27 and @entity28 : @entity29 ; @entity30 ( @entity31 59 ) , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 ( @entity37 86 ) , @entity20 ( @entity38 75 ) , @entity39 , @entity14 , @entity40 subs : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 goals : @entity40 17 , @entity14 45 , @entity20 55 , @entity39 90 & 113 , @entity37 100			1
@entity4 : @entity6 ; @entity47 ( @entity48 , 21 ) , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 64 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity24 , 64 ) , @entity58 subs : - @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , judge goals : @entity52 5 & 9 , @entity66 32 , @entity24 83 , @entity56 97 , @entity49 117 referee : @entity68 attendance : 1,576 but @entity2 was far from impressed with what he saw , he said : ‘ the players described that as embarrassing , disappointing and frustrating			1
‘ from a position of total dominance in the first half and we could have scored more to suddenly giving goals away			0
‘ there was a lot of poor defending and i have never seen a game like that before and i do n't want to see another one like it again			0
‘ we have to be better than that and that is no disrespect to @entity27 , they showed fantastic character and must have fancied their chances at 6 - 5 up			2
’ @entity4 raced into a two - goal lead inside 10 minutes thanks to a @entity91 brace			2
the @entity93 midfielder scored his first after sliding in at the far post , and his second from the edge of the box			0
@entity39 crossed for @entity40 to score as @entity27 pulled a goal back			0
a tropical storm midway through the first half made playing conditions very difficult for both sides			0
and it was @entity27 who struggled the most as @entity32 and played a terrible back pass to @entity106 and @entity66 nipped in to score his first goal for @entity4 since joining from @entity108 in the summer			2
but every time @entity27 looked like they were down and out they dragged themselves up			0
and on the stroke of half - time @entity14 broke clear and lifted the ball over @entity6 to bring the home side back into the game			2
@entity20 then wrong - footed @entity6 from 25 yards with an excellent strike to draw the @entity12 side level at 3 - 3			1
historic : the 6 - 6 scoreline at @entity121 was the first - ever such result in the history of the competition @entity4 thought they had won when @entity55 broke into the @entity27 box and pulled the ball across for @entity24 to score from close range			1
but with seconds remaining on the clock , @entity27 ’s @entity39 scored a spectacular goal to send the game into extra time			0
@entity4 struck first in extra time through @entity56 , who capped off an impressive debut			0
but @entity27 never knew when they were beaten and @entity37 levelled the game yet again			0
@entity39 completed @entity27 ’s incredible comeback with another shot from the edge of the area to make it 6 - 5 , but @entity49 came to @entity4 ’s rescue in the dying minutes of extra time , heading home @entity48 ’s cross to send the game to penalties			1
@entity6 went the right way to deny @entity13 and @entity14 as @entity4 scored all their spot - kicks to win 4 - 2			1
and @entity2 added : ‘ @entity6 proved what a good goalkeeper he is at penalties , he relishes that one - on - one situation and he did a great job for us			2

@entity6 was the hero as the @entity150 edged through to the @entity9 second round
despite this it was a *valiant* *effort* from @entity5 as they fought back from 3 - 1 down at one stage
@entity4 *manager* @entity2 was ' embarrased ' despite the @entity150 *progressing* on the night
as a result it was the first ever 6 - 6 draw the competition has ever had
