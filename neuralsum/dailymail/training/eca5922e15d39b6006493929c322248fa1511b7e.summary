the cousins became the third generation of their families to wingwalk on the @entity20 aircraft when they took off from @entity21 , near @entity22			1
his parents have set up the @entity47 to raise money to research a treatment or cure in time to save @entity42 ’s life			1
the girls ’ grandfather , @entity54 , was at the controls of @entity6 ’s plane while @entity57 , director of flying at @entity58 , piloted @entity24 ’s aircraft			1
@entity6 , who attends @entity60 in @entity61 , south - west @entity8 , likes animals , chocolate and ‘ anything pink ’ , as well as wingwalking			1
speaking minutes after getting down from the plane , she said : ‘ that was amazing			1
it ’s really hard to explain what it ’s like			1
it just felt like we were birds soaring over the neighbourhood			2
‘ it was really cool			2
when we were up in the air the houses were like @entity78 blocks			2
i was a little bit frightened but once i was in the air and having fun i got over it , it was really fun			2
for charity : the cousins were inspired to undertake the feat by the plight of their six - year - old friend @entity42 , who suffers from @entity44 in safe hands : the girls ’ grandfather , @entity54 , was at the controls of @entity6 ’s plane while @entity57 , director of flying at @entity58 , piloted @entity24 ’s aircraft in awe : @entity6 ( left ) said that the wingwalking ' felt like we were birds soaring over the neighbourhood ¿ helping hand : the parents of their six - year - old friend @entity42 have set up the @entity47 to raise money to research a treatment or cure in time to save @entity42 's life ‘ it ’s quite scary when you take off but if you like mega funfair rides i think you ’ll find the take - off really cool			1
the best bit was probably taking off or doing the @entity109 pose			2
’ ' it was really cool			2
when we were up in the air the houses were like @entity78 blocks ' @entity6 @entity6 added : ‘ it was really cold and i am still shivering but i ’m really glad i ’ve done it now - ( i ’d ) definitely do it again			1
‘ it feels really nice to have done something to help @entity42 and hopefully get lots of people to know about the @entity47			2
‘ it is dreadful that the older children like @entity42 get , the less able they become to do things that i take for granted			2
’ @entity24 , a pupil at @entity127 in @entity8 , loves animals and art and is also a keen drummer			0
she said : ‘ it was really , really fun and really , really windy			0
smoking : reaching speeds of up to 100mph and flying only metres apart , the girls broke the world record on the ground : @entity135 , who goes to school in @entity127 , said it was ' really , really fun and really , really windy ' impressive : @entity24 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) became the world 's youngest wingwalkers at @entity140 congratulations : @entity142 hugs his daughter @entity135 after the cousins achieved their spectacular feat ‘ the best bit is just being in the air			1
my cousin and i came up with the idea to be the youngest formation wingwalking team and wanted to help @entity42 together			0
’ @entity44 is the most common genetic killer of children worldwide			1
the disease is caused by a mistake on the genetic code in a gene called dystrophin which is found on the x chromosome			0
although girls may carry the mistake , they have two x chromosomes , so the healthy one cancels out the faulty one			0
but boys have only one @entity165 chromosome so they are more likely to be affected			0
the effect is that children suffering from the disease can not produce dystrophin , a protein necessary for muscle survival			0
as a result , every skeletal muscle in the body deteriorates			0
it is 100 per cent fatal and there is no cure			0
most boys die in their early 20s from heart or respiratory failure			0
the @entity47 is working to find a cure for the disease in 10 years			0
mr @entity54 , who has had a pilot ’s licence since he was 17 , said he was not nervous about the flight because it was in perfect weather conditions			1
‘ it was a double responsibility for me because it was my grandchildren , ’ he said			0
‘ i was more worried about whether they were going to enjoy it because although they have wanted to do it every year from the age of three , i ’ve always said no. ‘ what i ’m most proud about on this occasion , when they asked again , i said “ no ” but they said “ hang on , grandad , there ’s this friend of ours with this terrible disease and we want to raise awareness because no one knows about it ”			1
’ ‘ they gave me the whole story and i said “ ok , on this occasion i ’ll give in and we ’ll do it once ”			0
‘ that ’s why i ’m so proud of them - they really wanted to do it			1
i feel it is fantastic that nine - year - old girls feel they can help in this way			0
’ @entity220 , @entity42 ’s mother and founder of the @entity47 , said : ‘ we are very honoured that @entity6 and @entity24 are wingwalking to break a world record to help raise awareness of our charity			1
‘ this is a disease that desperately needs a cure			0
for other young children to be moved to help our child and hundreds of thousands of boys like him is very humbling			0
