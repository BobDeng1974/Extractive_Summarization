a struggling mother - of - three , who is battling terminal cancer , and her blind husband have received $ 1 million of donations after appealing to the @entity5 public for financial aid			1
the couple who first appeared on a current affair last month , have thanked the generous donors who have brought some joy into the lives of the @entity12			2
@entity14 's husband suddenly became blind in both eyes 16 years ago and the mother - of - three did not hesitate to take on the role of the family breadwinner			1
then , four years ago when the now 41 - year - old was diagnosed with breast cancer , @entity14 maintained her job throughout months of radiotherapy and chemotherapy while barely uttering a murmur of complaint			1
after being diagnosed with stage four stomach cancer and dropping down to a mere 41 kilograms , the @entity12 from @entity26 called out for help by taking their story of struggle and survival to the public			1
' it 's nice to think i 've got something to look forward to , some joy , instead of being in pain and not feeling well			0
i have something else to focus on			0
' ' we are just so appreciative of everything , the generosity and the money that is there to further @entity14 's future in life and hope it 's going to be worthwhile , ' mr @entity14 said			2
@entity14 and her husband @entity35 first met as teenagers before they finally began dating at 21 years of age			1
only two years after the duo married , things took a turn for the worse when @entity35 lost his eyesight and was declared legally blind			2
further damage to the nerves in his hands and arms rendered him unable to pursue a career as a masseuse , but the father of three - @entity81 , 13 , honey , 10 , and @entity83 , 5 - admits the hardest thing about his condition is having never seen his children			0

' the strain is starting to show , hence our call to arms with this campaign , as we 've finally convinced @entity14 to let us try and assist , ' ms @entity141 wrote			0
' she is a fighter , she is positive â€¦ but @entity14 can no longer cope with the struggles of bringing up a young family and loss of income			2
