by @entity0 a 9 - year - old boy was bitten in the leg by a large alligator that was in a @entity5 lake			1
the attack happened just after lunchtime on thursday in @entity9 lake at @entity10			2
@entity11 was riding his bicycle when he decided to take a dip in an area of the lake that is not reserved for swimming			1
the gator was nine feet long and has left the young man with bite marks on his leg - but it could have been so much worse			1
' he was just at the lakefront playing , and him and a couple of his friends - and they got in the water - they were swimming around , an alligator came up and just snatched him , ' said @entity0 ' grandfather , @entity40 to @entity41			2
mr @entity40 said his grandson thought it was his friends playing with him			0
' he was scared to death			0
he thought one of his friends was poking him and then all of a sudden it just grabbed him , ' said @entity40			2
' then he was fighting with it , hitting it in the face and it finally opened its mouth a little bit , and he hit it again in the eye and he got away from it			0
' nearby fishermen tried to capture the 500 - pound gator but it was so powerful it snapped the line			0
the city of @entity62 closed nearby swimming areas of the lake until further notice			1
once @entity0 ' wounds have healed , he will not only have a great story to tell , but a souvenir as well - he was able to snag one of the gator 's teeth when it tried to take a bite out of him			1
lucky lad : hospital officials said @entity19 , 9 , is in good condition eying up : several fisherman attempted to capture the 500lb alligator but on several occasions he broke the line more than 1.3 million alligators are thought to live in @entity5 , and gator bites are uncommon			1
alligators rarely bite people for reasons other than food , the @entity84 reports			0
some bites occur because of ' accidental collisions , ' such as if a swimmer bumps into an alligator			0
@entity84 reports 12 people were bitten by alligators in @entity5 last year			0
five of those bites were considered minor , seven were major and none was fatal			0
the last fatal alligator bite in @entity5 occurred in 2007 , when @entity99 was drowned by a gator in a pond at the @entity102 in @entity5			2
witnesses told wildlife officials the gator appeared to be about nine feet in length city officials have closed the lake to swimming while the search for the gator continues			1
