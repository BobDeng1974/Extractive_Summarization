by @entity0 @entity2 's post-match summary was as cutting as his impressive team had been in destroying and relegating a fragile @entity4			1
after watching his goalkeeper @entity7 clinch promotion to the @entity9 by saving a tame penalty by teenager @entity11 , the @entity6 manager declared this famous and thrilling victory to be a triumph of hope over fear			1
' over the two legs , we were desperate to win and @entity4 were terrified to lose , ' said @entity2			1
' i can understand ( the fear factor ) because i 've been relegated with @entity6 before but i just thought that was the difference between the two teams over the two legs – we were determined to win the game while @entity4 looked terrified to lose			1

attendance : 18,031 referee : @entity78 ( @entity67 )			0
@entity2 's assessment was spot on			2
from the moment @entity81 capitalised on some typically miserable @entity4 defending to put @entity6 into the lead , nervous tension spread across @entity38 , infecting players and fans alike			1
it had been exactly the same when @entity88 scored against the run of play to consign @entity4 to the play - offs in the first place			1
yet , to focus solely on the deficiencies of @entity4 would be to do @entity6 a major disservice			1
@entity2 's team were a credit to themselves and despite the sneers about their low following , from a footballing perspective on yesterday 's evidence they will be a fine addition to the top flight			2
while @entity4 were hopeless , and reliant on aimless hoofed balls forward , @entity2 's players admirably stuck to their passing principles			1
even three minutes into injury time , and needing a goal to level the tie , they refused to panic and passed the ball up the park until @entity81 's cut back was swept home by @entity114 @entity29			1
from first to last they left absolutely everything out on that pitch			0
and after 120 stamina sapping minutes , each player who strode forward to take a pressurised spot kick – @entity64 , @entity29 , @entity122 and @entity123 – showed no sign of fatigue			1
on a day that the @entity127 was also in town , it was a stunning feat of endurance by @entity6 , whose manager was one of the few not to fancy himself from the spot			2
' when it went to penalties , i was thinking " please , five guys put up your hands because i do n't want the pressure " , ' @entity2 admitted			2
' thankfully we had six hands going up			0
down and out : @entity143 players look dejected during their play - off penalty shootout heartache lashed home : @entity81 ( right ) started @entity6 's comeback with a first - half goal against @entity4 ' i asked which ones were not quite sure but they were all sure they would score			1
that was great for me			0
i was n't taking the fifth one , no chance			0
being player and manager and fifth penalty taker would have been too much for me			0
the goalie was on one before me			0
' @entity4 had not won at home since february 15 and it 's largely due to the kind of defending that saw them go behind yesterday			1
@entity42 's slack ball out of defence was sent forward by @entity65 to @entity29 , who played in @entity67			1
the @entity166 international striker spun the awful @entity41 quite beautifully before smacking a ferocious low shot goalwards from the edge of the box			0
the ball hit @entity39 and bounced up into the back of the net for @entity67 's ninth goal of the season			2
it was game on and rather appropriately the heavens above @entity178 opened to spit their fury on the @entity4 players			2
the biggest reflection of the crisis of confidence in the home ranks came when @entity46 ran clear on goal , only to hit a shot that was so poor and so lacking in power that it failed to go out for a throw in			0
@entity6 , meanwhile , were zipping the ball confidently about the @entity38 turf as if it were their own manor			1
as 17,000 @entity4 held their breath , at the other end it took a good save with his feet to stop @entity199 making it 2 - 2 on aggregate			1
a good @entity40 block stopped @entity199 pulling the trigger minutes later after fine build - up work			0
' going down with the @entity205 ' came the prescient cry from @entity6 fans , sensing blood			2
decisive strike : @entity11 missed penalty meant @entity4 's 15 - year @entity212 top flight stay is over saved : @entity51 also saw his penalty stopped as @entity4 lost 4 - 3 in the shootout at @entity38 man of the moment : @entity6 goalkeeper @entity7 saved two penalties in the play - off shootout @entity4 were truly pitiful and by the half hour mark their fans were jeering each misplaced pass , of which there were many			1
their well - remunerated players were being given the run around by @entity199 , signed from junior outfit @entity226 , and outfought by @entity227 , plucked from non-league @entity228			0
@entity11 did have a header kicked off the line by @entity63 but it was @entity4 ' only threat all afternoon and @entity29 hit the side netting just before the break			1
in the second half , @entity39 saved to stop @entity67 levelling the tie on aggregate			0
as @entity6 chased the second , @entity42 could have seen red for fouling @entity67 as he burst through on goal			2
@entity6 boss @entity2 then sent on @entity62 , @entity66 and himself but in rain of almost biblical proportions , it looked like @entity4 had weathered the storm			1
still , there was a strange sense of inevitability when , with just 75 seconds remaining , @entity67 set up @entity29 to take the tie into extra time			1
the final 30 minutes saw two big and correct calls by referee @entity78 , refusing to award @entity4 a penalty for a foul on @entity45 then booking @entity66 for diving at the other end 30 seconds later			2
@entity254 moment : @entity6 players celebrate promotion to inside their dressing room @entity260 viewing : @entity4 manager @entity261 was unable to prevent his side from blowing a 2 - 0 first leg lead frustration : @entity4 fans make their feelings known outside @entity38 after their relegation and so to penalties			1
@entity268 stepped @entity51 , whose poor kick was save			2
the former @entity271 and @entity67 star had chosen the wrong day to declare in the newspapers that @entity4 wo n't find a better midfielder than him			2
with @entity6 scoring with ease , the final kick fell to @entity11			1
he of the self - proclaimed left - foot that could ' open a tin of beans ' failed and @entity4 were sent down			1
the mood turned poisonous around @entity38			2
for @entity6 , though , this was a famous and deserved victory			2
and for @entity2 , it was one he had foretold			0
' i think people in general had written us off but i always believed we would win , ' he smiled			0
' i just had a feeling			0
i do n't know what it was			0
i was actually going to play myself from the start but then i got that feeling and took myself out of the team again			0
' i changed it about and to a man we were unbelievable			0
the effort we put in was incredible			0
i 'm pleased for the players			0
they 've put in so much this season and i felt we should have won the @entity301			0
' we did n't , @entity302 did , and that was difficult to accept			0
' but i heard ( @entity305 striker ) @entity306 saying recently the best way to go up is through the playoffs			0
now that we 've done it i know what he meant			0
