by @entity0 published : 10:21 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 19 october 2013 a group of @entity3 leaders could face felony charges after they filmed themselves destroying a 20 - million - year - old rock formation in a @entity7 state park			1
on the video , @entity8 is heard commenting on how unsafe the rock in @entity11 looks as he films his friend @entity12 forcing it from its perch while @entity16 stands by			1
the footage , which the men posted to their @entity20 pages , shows them then high - fiving , laughing and whooping with joy			1
the elder @entity16 jokingly flexes his muscles , proud of his achievement			1
but @entity26 officials are not taking the incident so lightly - and said that the three men could face felony charges for destroying the formation , which has been there for 20 million years			1
' it is not only wrong , but there will be consequences , ' he said			0
' this is highly , highly inappropriate			0
this is not what you do at state parks			1
it ’s disturbing and upsetting			0
' deputy @entity56 attorney @entity55 said he was aware of the incident but that it has not yet reached his office			0
if it does , he will consider whether to bring charges			0
he said they could face anywhere from a class b misdemeanor ( up to six months in prison ) to a second - degree felony ( one to 15 years in prison ) depending on how much the formation is valued , the @entity45 reported			2
he added : ' some things ca n’t be replaced , like photographs in a family album , but they have great sentimental value			0
' the rock formations at @entity11 in @entity7 are thousands of years old , formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock proud : the men said they were ' saving lives ' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child showing off : @entity12 , a boy scout leader , flexes his muscles after forcing the rock from its perch but the men insist that they only pushed the rock to the ground because it was unstable and they were concerned about it crushing a child playing nearby			1
on the video , @entity8 says : ' some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and @entity12 saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way			1
so it ’s all about saving lives here at @entity11			2
' @entity16 said he had seen a family walk close to the rock and when he touched it , it was loose			1
' i put my hand on a rock and it moved , ' he said			0
' while we were sitting right there we thought , " man if this rock falls it ’ll kill them "			0
' i did n’t have to push hard			0
' but when they left , he said he thought that he probably should have contacted a ranger before taking action			0
but the men said they had only seen one in the park that day			2
@entity11 is more than 3,600 acres of desert with hoodoo rock formations in @entity7 ' civic service ' : @entity16 , left , watched as @entity12 , right , pushed the rock down on october 11 stunning : the rock formation at @entity11 , pictured , was 20 million years old still , they apologized for their actions and said they wish they could have dealt with it differently			1
' glad we did it , wish we would n’t have done it , ' @entity12 said			2
@entity8 added : ' we 're extremely sorry for our actions			2
there was no in way shape or form any intent to go out there and cause any harm to our natural resources			0
' @entity139 added that seeing a loose rock does not mean a person should push it over			2
@entity12 and @entity8 are leaders for the local @entity145 troop and that they are also @entity147 youth leaders			1
they said authorities have not yet contacted them about the incident .			0

@entity8 , @entity12 and @entity16 posted video to @entity20 showing them pushing the rock in @entity11
they claim they destroyed it because the rock was loose and they worried it could crush a child along the *popular* path
but state park officials have said that the men could now face felony charges : ' it is just not what you do at state parks '
