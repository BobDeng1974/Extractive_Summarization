more than 100 birds have been injured during testing of a new solar power farm			1
biologists say 130 birds caught fire mid-air while entering an area of concentrated solar energy created by the 110 - megawatt @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity10			1
experts believe the birds may have been attracted by the glow of the farm ’s tower , but the project ’s owners , @entity18 , say they have found a way to reduce the fatalities			1
biologists say 130 birds have caught fire in mid-air while entering an area of concentrated solar energy created by the 110 - megawatt @entity8 ( pictured ) near @entity9 , @entity10 the solar project is close to being completion and is set to go launch next month			1
thousands of mirrors focus sunlight onto one central tower to melt salt inside it , which will in turn heat water so that steam will turn turbines to generate electricity			2
at its peak , the project will produce 110 megawatts of electricity , which will be sold to @entity42 – a firm that powers the majority of homes in @entity10 , @entity39 reported			2
in a test , one third of the project ’s 10,000 mirrors were moved to focus sunlight at a point 1,200 feet above ground level – at approximately twice the height of its tower			0
it took biologists just an hour and a half to notice the first of the ‘ streamers ’ – birds that catch fire and leave a trail of smoke in the air - when entering the field of solar energy			1
experts think the birds may have been attracted by glow of the farm ’s tower , but the project ’s owners , @entity18 , say they have found a way to reduce the fatalities			1
a scorched bird found near another solar farm in @entity79 ia shown at its peak , the project ( marked on the map ) , based near @entity9 , will produce 110 megawatts of electricity , which will be sold to @entity42 – a firm that powers the majority of homes in @entity10 some 130 birds were injured during the tests , which began on january 14 , @entity87 , deputy chief of communications for @entity89 in @entity90 , told @entity39			1
in a subsequent test , fewer mirrors were aimed at the focal point above the tower and this reduced the avian casualties			0
@entity18 says it has now put mitigation measures in place			0
‘ over the last 30 days of commissioning activities , which includes extended periods of flux [ sunlight ] on the tower , the @entity8 project has only experienced a single ( one ) avian fatality attributed to the solar facility ’ @entity18 ceo @entity99 said			1
a spokeman told @entity109 : ' once it was communicated to @entity18 that there were avian safety issues , action was immediately taken to halt testing in order to evaluate the situation and prevent further issues			0
' our engineers worked diligently to successfully modify our testing methods and develop innovative mitigation procedures that have proven to resolve the identified avian safety issues			0
' importantly , we ’re sharing the new safety methods with the solar tower industry so that changes can be made to protect wildlife and move forward with this revolutionary technology			2
' he said that the site was also carefully selected to have the minimal effect on wildlife , ' with avian safety one of out top priorities '			0
' this careful site selection resulted in zero desert tortoises on site and no current identified wildlife issues			0
' a report last year found that tens of thousands of birds flying over @entity79 are being scorched to death each year by powerful sun beams from the world 's largest solar plant – the @entity143			1
some 130 birds were injured during the tests , which began on january 14 , @entity87 , deputy chief of communications for @entity89 said			1
they are known as streamers because of the smoke trails people can see as they fly			0
this ' streamer ' was found at @entity143 solar plant in @entity79 the $ 2.2 billion ( £ 1.32 billion ) @entity143 launched last february at @entity153 near the @entity79 - @entity10 border			1
more than 300,000 mirrors , each the size of a garage door , reflect solar rays onto three boiler towers each looming up to 40 stories high			0
the water inside is heated to produce steam , which turns turbines that generate enough electricity for 140,000 homes			0
@entity167 rays sent up by the field of mirrors are bright enough to dazzle pilots flying in and out of @entity171 and @entity172			0
federal wildlife officials said @entity143 might act as a ' mega-trap ' for wildlife , with the bright light of the plant attracting insects , which in turn attract insect - eating birds that fly to their death in the intensely focused light rays			2
federal and state biologists call the number of deaths significant , based on sightings of birds getting singed and falling , and on retrieval of carcasses with feathers charred too severely for flight			0
@entity143 officials dispute the source of the so - called streamers , saying at least some of the puffs of smoke mark insects and bits of airborne rubbish being ignited by the solar rays			2
estimates per year range from a low of about a thousand by @entity205 - the operator of a solar farm in the @entity207 - to 28,000 by an expert for the @entity210 environmental group			2
' the deaths are alarming			0
it 's hard to say whether that 's the location or the technology , ' said @entity215 , renewable - energy director for the @entity79 chapter of the @entity218			1
' there needs to be some caution			0
' the plant has been monitoring the number of bird carcasses found on its grounds during periodic studies , but there are fears that because the solar farms appear to be capable of vapourising birds as large as ravens in mid-air , the full extent of the problem may not come to light in the surveys			2
mr @entity215 believes that authorities should track birds on during annual migratory seasons , before opening any more solar projects			2
solar farms have been also been criticised for their impacts on desert tortoises			0
last summer , @entity245 officials warned @entity79 that the power - tower style of solar technology holds ' the highest lethality potential ' of the many solar projects burgeoning in the deserts of @entity79			1
the $ 2.2 billion @entity143 ( pictured ) part - owned by @entity251 has been blamed for killing birds , which experts say are being scorched by its mighty mirrors			1

around 130 birds have been injured near @entity9 , @entity10
' streamers ' caught alight while while entering an area of concentrated solar energy created by the 110 - megawatt @entity8
experts think birds may have been attracted by glow of the farm 's tower
experts have *previously* claimed that a @entity79 solar array part owned by @entity270 is killing nearly *30,000* birds per year
