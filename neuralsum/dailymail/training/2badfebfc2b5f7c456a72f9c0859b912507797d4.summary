this was a night for @entity2 , the defender @entity4 rate in the £ 10million bracket , to make a bold , decisive impact in @entity9 competition			1
it ’s doubtful this was what the @entity13 manager had in mind			2
@entity19 ’s dismissal , for two soft yellow cards in nine first half minutes , was both damaging and contentious			1
through @entity4 eyes the @entity21 referee @entity20 , a card happy , inconsistent character , was a key contributor to their latest night of disappointment on @entity29 soil			1
as they left the field @entity4 players remonstrated long and bitterly with the referee			1
@entity33 ’s stunning 20 yard strike had broken their stubborn , tired resistance three minutes from time , but the anger lingered long into the night			1
@entity33 ( centre ) scores from outside the area in the 88th minute to send @entity39 through over @entity4 @entity40 ( left ) had been in great form on the night for @entity4 but could not keep @entity33 's strike out @entity33 celebrates after scoring the goal that sealed @entity39 's progression into the last 16 of the @entity45 @entity46 ( left ) celebrates with his @entity39 team - mates after scoring against @entity4 in the 88th minute @entity2 ( third left ) looks away as he is dismissed in the first half for @entity4 against @entity39 @entity50 ( centre ) and @entity4 will have reason to feel aggrieved with the referee after the game @entity39 : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 , 81 ) , @entity33 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 , 80 ) , @entity65 ( @entity64 , 89 ) , @entity66 , @entity67			1
subs not used : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72			2
goal : @entity74 ( 88 ) bookings : @entity59 , @entity74			2
@entity4 : @entity40 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity2 , @entity78 , @entity79 ( @entity80 , 40 ) , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity84 ( commons , 78 ) , @entity85 , @entity86 ( @entity87 , 59 )			1
subs not used : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92			2
bookings : @entity40 , @entity76 , @entity78 , @entity94			2
red card : @entity19 referee : @entity20 the disappointment wo n’t be eased by the knowledge the club will inevitably face yet another trial by @entity101 for events high in the top tier of the @entity104 , after a handful of mindless idiots in their 3500 travelling support ignored pre-match pleas to leave their flares at home			2
for the second successive away game pyrotechnics were witnessed amongst the @entity13 fans , in the 49th minute of a game their team finished with credit			2
they are out of the @entity45 after a sixth successive away game without winning			0
from the moment @entity19 sustained his second booking – as soft as the first – their fate looked almost inevitable			0
@entity4 ’s number five collided with @entity124 in 27 minutes in a clumsy challenge			1
with an hour to play there was an ominous feel to the flash of yellow and so it proved when @entity19 clumsily panicked and blundered into the back of @entity67 in 36 minutes			2
@entity39 players , the masters of influencing impressionable referees , did their bit			1
the red card was duly shown and @entity4 ’s early promise , their growing optimism , was dented			1
ironically , there were long spells after @entity19 ’s departure when the @entity142 champions looked more secure			0
they repelled their serie a opponents manfully despite their numerical disadvantage			0
the shame of it all is this			0
with eleven men this was a night which promised so much more			0
in their imposing @entity104 cathedral @entity151 ’s @entity39 were here for the taking			1
with a full complement for half an hour @entity4 were confident , composed , dangerous			1
@entity19 ( right ) looks dismayed as he leaves the pitch at the @entity104 after being shown a red card @entity19 contests for the ball alongside @entity39 striker @entity67 in the @entity45 game @entity67 ( centre ) turns the ball goalwards with a header from a cross for @entity39 against @entity142 side @entity4 @entity33 shoots at goal for @entity39 as they tried to enforce their advantage at home against @entity4 @entity4 goalkeeper @entity40 ( centre ) makes a save to deny @entity39 from going ahead against his team @entity40 ( left ) made solid block to deny @entity66 from opening the scoring for @entity39 @entity84 ( right ) slides across to block @entity46 ( left ) from delivering a cross into the penalty area @entity174 ( left ) tries to hold of @entity58 ( right ) of @entity39 at the @entity104 they had a great chance in eight minutes when @entity174 was in on goal , clean as a whistle			1
the former @entity179 man gathered @entity78 ’s probing cross , took a great first touch and made time to pick his spot			0
his sidefoot was blocked by @entity55 , @entity39 sweeping up the park instantly to create a shooting chance for @entity124			1
but this was a night when @entity40 , in contrast with the 3 - 3 first leg draw in @entity189 , looked the part			0
he blocked @entity124 ’s effort and , before him , @entity19 was beginning to look like the defender people think he can be at this level			0
then the roof caved in			0
there will be @entity4 people who suspect the referee was a homer from the start			1
long before he started waving his red card around			0
in 14 minutes the @entity142 champions shouted long and hard for a penalty kick			0
@entity84 ( centre ) of @entity4 goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by @entity56 of @entity39 @entity82 ( right ) competes for the ball alongside @entity58 ( left ) of @entity39 in the @entity45 game in a fine move @entity86 , starting up front after @entity211 sustained an injury on wednesday night , poked the ball into the path of @entity85 , the @entity217 ’s first time nudge into the path of @entity84 sending the midfielder towards goal			1
what happened next was a huge bone of contention			0
at first glance @entity39 full - back @entity56 leaned into his back			1
television pictures were less conclusive			0
had @entity4 won the penalty it would have been soft			1
but no softer than the two yellow cards which rendered them numerically disadvantaged after 36 minutes			1
and , to the despair and dismay of the 3500 travelling support – they left their flares at home this time – forced @entity0 to introduce @entity80 to the fray for the withdrawn @entity79			0
in more ways than one the psyche , the feel , of this game changed			0
for half an hour @entity4 had found their way into @entity39 ’s faces			1
they pressed high up the pitch , they carved the better chances			0
the minute @entity19 went the game changed			2
like a pin pricking the bubble of optimism @entity0 ’s side – chasing the first win in 12 attempts on @entity29 soil in the club ’s history – looked shot			2
they still had @entity40 of course			0
no one believed the @entity261 keeper ’s haphazard performance in @entity189 was likely to be repeated here and it was n’t			0
@entity4 fans were in fine voice throughout their side 's encounter against @entity39 in the @entity45 last 32 @entity4 fans light a flare during the game against @entity39 in the @entity45 on thursday @entity269 ( left ) of @entity4 tries to hold off a challenge from @entity58 ( right ) of @entity39 he pulled off an outstanding wrist twisting save from @entity67 ’s eight yard header immediately after the red card			1
in a frantic spell before half - time he then brilliantly blocked a driven , angled effort from @entity276 after strong defending from @entity77			2
he was at it again in 55 minutes			0
resuming normal service and proving the first leg aberrations were freakish in nature			0
expectations of an @entity39 storm at the outset of the second half proved misplaced			1
but chances were inevitable and @entity67 – a hugely talented footballer – crafted one when he ghosted in behind the visiting defence , failing to angle his low shot enough to put it past a goalkeeper growing in confidence more and more by the minute			1
the problem for @entity4 was obvious			1
a man down they began to drop deeper and tire			0
in attack @entity86 – with two goals in two games – toiled for mobility and pace			0
the loss of @entity211 the night before in training was now apparent			0
@entity87 – a winger – replaced the @entity301 in attack			0
@entity39 manager @entity151 throws the ball to a player during his team 's game against @entity4 @entity4 manager @entity0 issues instructions to his team during the match against their @entity29 opponents @entity62 ( centre ) plays the ball for @entity39 during their game against @entity4 in the @entity45 last 32 inevitably it did nothing to prevent @entity4 ’s slow , weary retreat into their own half			1
a 4 - 4 - 1 formation left @entity87 – a player short of match sharpness - to run around up front in the hope of a breakaway			0
predictably , @entity39 dominated possession			1
they had a fine chance in 66 minutes when @entity124 found space at the back post to head square for the unmarked @entity66			0
the ball was inches too high and , again , @entity4 survived			1
@entity39 did n’t need a goal , of course			1
to that end the final throw of the dice was the introduction of @entity50 with 12 minutes to play			0
he stung the palms of @entity55 in the @entity39 goal with his first audacious long range shot			2
there was nothing to lose now			0
somehow @entity4 needed a goal			2
the game needed a goal			0
regrettably it came for @entity39 and it was outstanding			2
@entity4 were defending for their lives when @entity33 , the @entity345 midfielder , wound back his right foot and smashed an outstanding shot into the postage stamp corner .			1

@entity2 was sent off in the first half for @entity4 for two yellow cards
a stern *defensive* display meant @entity39 could not get past @entity4
but @entity33 eventually struck in the 88th minute to win it
