by @entity0 published : 06:29 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 07:22 est , 5 august 2013 a ' graveyard of comets ' has been found by astronomers in the asteroid belt between @entity5 and @entity6			1
and , to the surprise of astronomers , a number of comets in this graveyard have come back to life after being dormant for what could have been thousands or even millions of years			1
the findings , by a @entity16 team , contradict the long - standing view that the main asteroid belt was once populated by thousands of comets which ultimately burned out as they aged			1
a number of comets in the asteroid belt between @entity5 and @entity6 have come back to life after being dormant			1
the findings contradict the long - standing view that the main asteroid belt was once populated by thousands of comets which ultimately burned out as they aged over the past ten years researchers have found 12 active comets in the asteroid belt			1
the mystery of the reactivated comets led the @entity16 team to investigate their origin			0
their findings suggests that these comets came back to life after moving closer to the sun. the astronomers believe other inactive comets in the region may flare up when a stray gravitational force from @entity6 nudges them			1
‘ imagine all these asteroids going around the sun for aeons , with no hint of activity , ’ said professor @entity44 of @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity16			0
the top image shows the conventional model for the asteroid belt			2
the middle image shows the proposed model , with a small number of active comets			0
the lower diagram shows how the asteroid belt might have looked in the early solar system ‘ we have found that some of these are not dead rocks after all , but are dormant comets that may yet come back to life			1
’ surprisingly , this can happen fairly easily			0
if nudged by the gravitational force of @entity6 , the shape of comet orbits can change , leading to a decrease in the minimum distance between the comet and the sun. the little extra energy they receive from the sun is then sufficient to revive them from the graveyard			2
‘ these objects are the ' @entity84 comets ' , returning to life after being dormant for thousands or even millions of years , ’ said professor @entity44			2
‘ potentially any one of the many thousands of their quiet neighbours could do the same thing			0
’ the new work looked at a distinct region of the solar system , the main belt of asteroids between the orbits of @entity5 and @entity6			1
this volume of space contains more than 1 million objects ranging in size from 1 m to 800 km. comets are amongst the smallest objects in the solar system , typically a few km across and composed of a mixture of rock and ice			0
if they come close to the sun , then some of the ice turns to gas , before being swept back by the light of the sun and the solar wind to form a characteristic tail of gas and dust			2
most observed comets have highly elliptical orbits , meaning that they only rarely approach the sun. some of these so - called long period comets take thousands of years to complete each orbit around our nearest star			0
there is also a population of about 500 short period comets , created when long period comets pass near @entity6 and are deflected in orbits that last anything between three and 200 years			2
although uncommon events , comets also collide with the @entity130 from time to time and may have helped bring water to our planet			0
the new work looked at a distinct region of the solar system , the main belt of asteroids between the orbits of @entity5 and @entity6			1
this volume of space contains more than 1 million objects ranging in size from 1 m to 800 km in june , astronomers in the @entity145 observed , for the first time , what they described as a ' comet factory ' around a young @entity149 noticed how particles around the young star grow by clumping together , solving a long - standing mystery about how dust particles in discs form comets or planets.the ‘ dust trap ’ was found by @entity157 der @entity158 , a phd student at @entity159 using the new @entity160 ( @entity160 )			0
‘ it ’s likely that we are looking at a kind of comet factory because the particles can grow in this dust trap up to cometary sizes of a few kilometres , ’ said @entity158 .			0

*scientists* believe that they have discovered a region of formerly dead comets in the asteroid belt lying between @entity5 and @entity6
it is thought that @entity6 *'s* gravitational pull brings dormant comets closer to the sun , which in turn *reignites* them and brings them ' back to life '
