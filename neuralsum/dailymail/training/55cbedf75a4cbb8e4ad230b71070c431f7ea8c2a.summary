@entity0 is the only developed country producing school leavers who are worse at maths and reading than their grandparents , according to a damning report			1
the study found 16 to 24 - year - olds are among the least literate and numerate in the world , lagging behind those in countries including @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity15			1
@entity0 came 22nd out of 24 countries for the reading skills of its young people and 21st for maths , according to the @entity20			1
damning report : an international study has found that the @entity24 's young people are ' among the least literate and numerate in the developed world ' ( file picture ) the figures showed many @entity29 school leavers are more advanced than @entity0 university graduates			1
the @entity20 said @entity0 was the only country where the oldest age group studied ( 55 - 65 ) had a higher proficiency in literacy and numeracy than the youngest ( 16 - 24 ) after other factors such as sex , socio - economic background and type of occupation were taken into account			1
the organisation warned @entity0 would struggle with competitors in global markets unless urgent action was taken			0
the @entity46 said the report exposed the failings of @entity49 during its 13 years in power			1
‘ these are @entity49 ’s children , educated under a @entity49 government and force - fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations , ’ said skills and enterprise minister @entity52			1
@entity49 came to power in 1997 after @entity58 pledged his priority would be ‘ education , education , education ’			2
@entity0 was the only country in developed world in which those aged 55 - 65 performed better than 16 - 24 - year - olds today 's findings show that the billions poured into education by @entity49 failed to push up standards of literacy and numeracy , critics have said			1
the government has claimed that the @entity20 's research underlines who ' @entity49 's children , educated under a @entity49 government and force - fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations			1
' official figures from the @entity81 have shown that @entity49 ’s spending on education rose from £ 35.3billion in 2000 to £ 63.9billion in 2009			1
yet it appears large numbers left school with no improvements in standards when compared to previous generations			0
last year a different report found despite @entity58 declaring his priorities as ‘ education , education , education ’ when he swept to power in 1997 , a huge increase in spending on schools led to ‘ no improvement in student learning outcomes ’			0
the @entity20 study – education at a glance – found that expenditure on @entity24 primary and secondary schools and colleges as a percentage of @entity109 increased from 3.6 per cent in 1995 to 4.5 per cent in 2009 , higher than the @entity20 average of four per cent			1
at the same time , there has been ‘ no improvement in student learning outcomes ’ , the report said spending in the sector soared by 78 per cent from £ 50billion to £ 89billion by the time the party lost the election in 2010			0
during this period , @entity119 and a-level grades rose every year , which critics claimed was evidence of dumbing down			0
@entity123 , of the @entity20 , said young adults had more qualifications than those nearing retirement , but not greater abilities			2
this indicated that there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills			0
the finding ‘ does n’t look good for the @entity24 ’ , mr @entity123 said			2
the 466 - page study was the first carried out by the @entity20 into the work skills of 16 to 65 - year - olds , establishing their abilities in literacy , numeracy and problem solving			1
a total of 166,000 were interviewed in 24 countries , including 9,000 in @entity0 and @entity143			1
@entity144 and @entity145 were not covered			0
the study found a quarter of adults in @entity0 ( 8.5million ) have the maths skills of a ten - year - old , with a large minority only able to perform sums with whole numbers			2
literacy levels are also below average , with 16.4 per cent of adults ( 5.8million ) reading at the level of a child in the penultimate year of primary school			0
just 42.4 per cent of young adults were proficient in problem solving			0
this was around 8 percentage points less than the average of 50.7 per cent , and 21 behind the best - performing country , @entity163			2
not moving forward : this chart from the report shows how @entity24 's young people and older people are roughly at the same level , whereas countries like @entity163 are showing huge improvement between generations picture of @entity24 : this graph shows how the @entity24 compared to other industrial nations when it came to numeracy interesting : countries like @entity29 , @entity175 and @entity176 were the top performing in terms of literacy , even though children start school often years later than @entity24 youngsters @entity0 produced 8 per cent of the world ’s most highly skilled workers in the late 1960s and 70s			1
this has dropped to 4 per cent and the trend is expected to continue			0
the report said the ‘ talent pool of highly skilled adults in @entity0 ... is likely to shrink relative to that of other countries ’ in the next few decades			2
the slide could be reversed only if ‘ significant action is taken to improve skills proficiency among young people ’			0
@entity0 also lags behind other nations in the proportion of people continuing with education into adulthood			2
one positive note was that the country has been successful in making good use of its pool of skilled talent , resulting in high productivity and wages			0
the @entity209 has taken steps to improve education , demanding an end to grade inflation and making courses and exams tougher			0
the number of top gcse and a-level grades has now decreased for the past two years			0
@entity219 , of the @entity220 , said : ‘ the @entity20 report highlights what our members tell us – that young people do n’t have the literacy and numeracy skills to do the job properly			1
we need action to improve these crucial basic skills from an early age			0
’ the shadow education secretary , @entity232 , defended @entity49 ’s record , saying it ‘ drove up standards in maths and @entity0 across our schools , evident in the huge improvements we saw in gcse results between 1997 and 2010 ’			1
failed ? the government said today this generation of young people are ' @entity49 's children ' ' force - fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations ' @entity245 , of the @entity246 , said the report ‘ underlines the credibility gap between the picture painted by decades of rises in exam pass rates and employers ’ real - world experience of interviewing and employing people ’			1
former @entity49 education and employment secretary @entity255 questioned the @entity20 ’s methodology and said the report ‘ warranted united action , not party political point scoring ’			1
education has undergone massive change since @entity49 began replacing grammar schools with the comprehensive system in 1965			2
in 1988 @entity119 replaced o - levels and the @entity266 was introduced , and in 1997 @entity49 abolished the @entity267 awarding free places at fee - paying schools to gifted children from low or middle - income families			2
the academy schools programme began in 2000 , with schools funded by the state and made independent of local government control			0
in 2010 the @entity209 launched free schools , which are similar to academies but can be set up by groups including parents , teachers , charities			0
participants in the skills survey were asked to answer a series of questions testing their numeracy , literacy and problem solving			0
here are some examples : @entity291 literacy			0

' *deeply* worrying ' report shows scale of problems with @entity24 education system
literacy and numeracy tables show @entity0 22 and 21 out of 24 countries
' school leavers among the least literate and numerate in developed world '
government calls them ' @entity49 ’s children force - fed a diet of dumbing down '
@entity312 's *author* @entity20 admits research ' does n’t look good for the @entity24 '
@entity0 only country where those retiring have better skills than the young
@entity49 says years of rising gcse grades proves they ' drove up standards '
