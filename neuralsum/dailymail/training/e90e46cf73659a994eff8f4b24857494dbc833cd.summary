purses , wallets and cash will become redundant within three years , according to the electronic payment firm @entity4			1

the claims came as the firm , which is owned by @entity14 , unveiled a new roll - out of its mobile phone - based smart payment system			1
this means shoppers can authorise payments on their phone , with the money immediately transferred to the trader , just as they currently do with internet purchases			2
the retailer gets a ‘ payment confirmed ’ message on their own smartphone or tablet which includes a picture of the customer by way of a security guarantee			2
@entity4 research suggests that most consumers do not carry more than £ 20 in cash on them			1
already , many people rarely use cash on a day to day basis , relying on debit and credit cards for all their purchases , whether it is petrol , a train ticket , a newspaper or a sandwich for lunch			2
the new @entity4 smartphone app adds another alternative to folding money and coins			1
futuristic : the new @entity4 here app will be launched today at @entity69 's @entity68 market , pictured the internet giant @entity4 wants shoppers to pay for items electronically while standing in a shop it also means retailers who have not taken card payments in the past , such as market traders , now have a new relatively cheap and new way to allow customers to pay			1

futuristic : the latest move could end the days of fumbling for cash , already a rare sight on the high street @entity126 , @entity4 ’s director of mobile merchant services , said : ‘ we know from our research that shoppers do n’t usually carry more than £ 20 these days , so it ’s great to see that these traders will never miss a sale again because a customer has to dash off to get cash			1
‘ this is another step on the journey towards a wallet-less high street , where customers will be able to leave their wallet or purse at home and pay using their phone or tablet			0
we predict that by 2016 this will become a reality			0
’ the firm ’s pr director , @entity147 , added : ‘ we believe that is because using a mobile to pay for things will be so commonplace that people will not feel the need to carry cash			0

but now i ’ve lost count of how many times people ask to pay by card or say they ’ll just pop to the cash point but never come back			0
‘ giving our customers more options to pay and taking cards solves the problem , which is especially crucial in the run - up to @entity181			0
