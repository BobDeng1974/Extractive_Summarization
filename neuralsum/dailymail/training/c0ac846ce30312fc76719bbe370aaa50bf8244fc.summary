a global vaccine to prevent the leading cause of food poisoning and diarrhoea is one step closer , scientists claim a global vaccine to prevent the leading cause of diarrhoea and food poisoning is one step closer , researchers claim			1
scientists have managed to colllect detailed information about the @entity14 bacteria , which causes millions of cases of diarrhoea a year			1
they found that strains of the @entity14 cluster into surprisingly closely - related groups			1
this means the bacteria causing disease in @entity22 are very similar to those in @entity24 and @entity25			2
similarities between the strains of bacteria mean a global vaccine is possible , experts said			1
@entity14 causes 400,000 deaths and 400 million cases of diarrhoea each year in low and middle - income countries , as well as misery to many travellers across the affected regions			1
the study , which was the largest ever into this potentially - lethal bacteria , was based on data from 362 different strains of @entity14 which span 30 years and 20 countries			1
by comparing the way strains attach to human stomach lining , researchers from @entity44 and the @entity45 found that strains clustered into closely - related groups			1
the close relationship between samples suggests a vaccine could be effective worldwide			0
professor @entity53 , senior author from the @entity54 , said : ' this research strengthens our belief that it is possible to target a broad range of enterotoxigenic @entity14 ( @entity61 ) groups with one vaccine			1
@entity61 is a strain of @entity14 that is the leading cause of diarrhoea in the developing world			2
lead author @entity67 , from the @entity45 and the @entity54 called the data gathered ' exceptional '			0
researchers from around the world will be able to use it to find out about the ability of each strain of @entity14 to cause disease , and what they have in common , she said			2
@entity14 ( usually referred to as @entity14 ) are bacteria found in the digestive system of humans and many other animals			1
many strains are harmless and may play a useful role in the gut , helping us to stay healthy			0
however , certain strains produce a toxin			0
strains that produce the toxin can cause mild to bloody diarrhoea , stomach cramps , nausea and vomiting			0
occasionally the infection is so severe that patients develop haemolytic uraemic syndrome ( @entity94 ) , which is associated with kidney failure , anaemia , and bleeding			0
it can take three to four days for symptoms to develop			0
they can last for up to two weeks or longer in cases where there are no other complications			0
most cases of @entity14 food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef ( particularly mince , burgers and meatballs ) or drinking unpasteurised milk			2
she added : ' all of this research helps us to identify the shared weaknesses in @entity61 bacteria that we can exploit with vaccines			0
' dr @entity116 , a co-author of the study , from @entity44 , added that whole genome sequencing – a process in which the complete dna of an organism 's genes is established – has allowed them to understand what makes an @entity61 bacteria			1
the challenge now , he said , ' is to distil , from the vast wealth of data locked up in this dataset , the information needed to develop these new treatments to fight this key pathogen			0
' while @entity61 was previously thought to vary widely across the world , this study traces many of the 21 different strains back their origins			2
it was found that they can be traced back to an individual bacterium that was able to infect humans and spread , due to global travel			1
according to this data , the emergence of these strains of @entity14 probably took place between 51 and 170 years ago , a finding that suggests that they stable and unlikely to become quickly resistant to vaccines			2
' our work to develop a vaccine has received a real boost from this research , ' says dr @entity154 , an author from the @entity45 and @entity155 , @entity156			0
' this data gives us confidence that a global , future - proof solution is within our grasp			0
' @entity14 ( pictured ) causes 400,000 deaths and 400 million cases of diarrhoea each year in low and middle - income countries , as well as misery to many travellers across the affected regions			1

scientists managed to colllect detailed information about the @entity14 bacteria
@entity14 causes 400,000 deaths and 400 million cases of diarrhoea each year
scientists carried out whole genome sequencing on strains of @entity14
this means they were able to *map* and analyse the bacteria 's dna
found strains of @entity14 are closely - related , making a global vaccine possible
origins of one of the *nastiest* strains was traced back to one bacterium
