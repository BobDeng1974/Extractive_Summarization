by @entity0 for @entity1 what better place to hold a black tie event than the beach ? at least that 's what these 200 revellers thought when they dressed in their finery - only to run into the sea and get covered in sand at @entity13 's @entity12 beach			1
the event was organised by @entity13 - based group @entity15 , whose website boasts : ' we cause scenes			2
' it made a bizarre spectacle as women clad in expensive ball gowns lifted their skirts and ran into the waves as regular swimmers gawked at the debauchery			0
and men ripped off their bow ties and cummerbunds and threw top hats in the air as they ran full pelt into the water			0
some had even come prepared for the beach party , wearing inflatable arm bands over their dinner jackets , while other stripped down to swimming trunks			0
