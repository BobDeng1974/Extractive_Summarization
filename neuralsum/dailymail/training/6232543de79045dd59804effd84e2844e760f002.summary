a baroness has spoken of her ‘ horror ’ at discovering she could see her own garden using @entity4 satellite imagery			1
@entity5 said : ‘ i was horrified the other day when i was given a certain website to look at			1
i could see the roses in my garden			2
‘ it was on a @entity4 map or something , and i have no idea how it was taken			0
@entity5 said the picture of her garden , in which she could see her roses , had been ' taken up there ' ‘ it was taken from up there			1
obviously it was not a large aircraft , but this is happening			0
it did not fill me with a sense of security			0
’ but her comments , which were shared more than 2,000 times on @entity27 , provoked concern among internet users that she appeared not to understand the difference between satellites – which capture images used by @entity4 – and aerial photography			1
others voiced concern that the baroness , who is also on the @entity38 , was not familiar with basic technology like @entity40			1
one @entity27 user wrote : ‘ good @entity43 , these people are supposed to look out for us and they do n’t know even the basics of today ’s world			2
’ another said : ‘ good thing she ’s not involved in creating laws that touch on public policy or technology			0
oh wait … ’ the baroness ’s comments were made during a @entity38 sub-committee meeting on the rise of personal drones which can take aerial pictures and video , and how they should be regulated			1
@entity60 , of the @entity61 , said there was a problem with people buying small drones ( file ) @entity60 , of the @entity61 , said there was a growing problem with members of the public buying small drones , often fitted with cameras , for personal use without realising they were regulated by aviation law			2
he told the committee : ‘ you can go into @entity77 today and buy a fairly sophisticated system for about £ 500			0
the question is that when you get the box home , where , first of all , does it tell you that you are buying an aircraft , let alone anything else ? ‘ they are viewed in the @entity85 as aircraft , and you have responsibilities under that order , but if i do not know that they are aircraft i do not know how to behave			0
this is a very real problem that we are aware of			0
’ he said the @entity94 was calling on manufacturers to include information on aviation law and relevant data protection and privacy law with drones sold for personal use .			2
