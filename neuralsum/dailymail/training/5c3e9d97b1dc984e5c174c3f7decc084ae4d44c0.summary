as well as standard age ratings such as @entity2 , @entity3 and 18 we may soon be seeing films given an additional rating based on its depiction of female characters			1
the @entity8 has announced that it will be introducing a new ' f ' rating when it opens for its 24th year later this week , which will indicate that a film either has a strong female protagonist , director or screenwriter or addresses women 's issues			1
this rating takes forward the idea of the ' @entity18 ' , which festival organisers believe is too restrictive , and aims to counteract the gender stereotyping of women that is so prominent in the film industry			1
despite the strong female lead , played by @entity25 , gravity would not pass the @entity27 test the ' @entity18 ' was developed by cartoonist and @entity30 feminist @entity29 and monitors whether at least two female characters talk to each other about subjects other than men			1
cinemas in @entity36 embraced the guidance system , last year introducing an ‘ a ’ rating to highlight films that failed the @entity27 test and so are deemed to have a shortage of ‘ female perspectives ’			1
however the organisers of this years @entity8 felt that the rating was lacking , prompting them to introduce their ' f ' rating , which is held by only 19 of the 42 films being shown during the festival , including @entity49 's new film ' @entity50 ' , my old lady starring @entity53 and @entity54 which is @entity56 ’s story of life during @entity58			1
many believe @entity49 will be given an @entity60 for her role in ' @entity50 ' - one of the films given an ' f ' @entity54 , starring @entity64 as @entity56 and @entity65 as @entity66 , is one of the films that has been awarded a ' f ' rating in the @entity8 speaking to the @entity70 of @entity71 explained the decision to expand on the @entity27 rating : ' there 's quite a lot of films with significant female roles that do n't pass the @entity27 test			1
gravity is the classic of course where @entity25 ( @entity25 ) plays such a strong character in the film but does n't speak to another woman			2
' i also wanted to illustrate the discrepancies not just in people on screen but those behind the camera			0
' there is a significant gender difference in the numbers of men and women in producing , writing and directing roles			2
the ' @entity18 ' was developed by cartoonist and @entity30 feminist @entity29 , pictured ' if you speak to people in the film industry they will claim there is no gender inequality , yet only 4.7 per cent of the films coming out of @entity104 last year were directed by women which is just staggering			1
' i do n't think it is something considered or intentional within the industry			0
and it is certainly not based on concerns over profit ; films directed by women gross the same , films with female lead tend to gross more , and more women buy cinema tickets than men			1
' @entity117 and the @entity8 organising committee hope that their new ' f ' rating will draw attention to this issue , as well as the female characters depicted in films			1
' if you look at movies there are minuscule numbers of women in professional roles in them , yet , certainly in the @entity133 and @entity30 , in reality it is 50 per cent			0
they do n't reflect reality			0
' it feels as if we do n't shine a light on it and acknowledge it wont ever change			0
we need to look at it and talk about it			0
' it would be great if everybody took it on so that people who are interested carry on having the conversation about how disproportionate it is			0
' they hope that the f rating will also go some way to helping alleviate the falling numbers of women in the film industry in the @entity133			1
figures from the @entity157 ’s @entity156 for 2013 show that in 2011 , 18.9 per cent of @entity133 writers for released films were female , in 2012 , it was 13.4 per cent			2
similarly , in 2011 15 per cent of all @entity133 films released were directed by women , this went down too to just 7.8 per cent in 2012			0
research in the @entity30 also supports the notion that women are underrepresented on the screen and that little has changed in the past 60 years			0
of the @entity30 top 100 films in 2011 , women accounted for 33 per cent of all characters and only 11 per cent of the protagonists , according to a study by the @entity171 - based @entity170			0
another study , by the @entity172 at the @entity173 , showed the ratio of male to female characters in movies has remained at about two to one for at least six decades			0
that study , which examined 855 top box - office films from 1950 - 2006 , showed female characters were twice as likely to be seen in explicit sexual scenes as males , while male characters were more likely to be seen as violent			2
‘ apparently @entity104 thinks that films with male characters will do better at the box office			0
it is also the case that most of the aspects of movie - making - writing , production , direction , and so on - are dominated by men , and so it is not a surprise that the stories we see are those that tend to revolve around men , ’ @entity184 , the study 's lead author , said in an email .			2

@entity71 's 24th @entity8 to introduce new ' f ' rating
will be given to films with strong female lead , director , producer or writer
only 19 of the 42 films to be shown have been given an ' f ' rating
speaking to the @entity70 , festival producer says she hopes to start conversation on the gender inequality in film industry
