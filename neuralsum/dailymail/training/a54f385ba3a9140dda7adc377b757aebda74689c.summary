he is the wing wizard who combined sublime talent with incredible longevity			1
sir @entity4 played until he was 50 having taken care of his body in an era when science and sport never mixed			1
he made his debut in march 1932 for @entity11 and played his last game for them 33 years later on february 6 , exactly half a century ago			1
in between , he forged hero status at @entity15 , winning the 1953 @entity16 in a final that became synonymous with his name			1
he won two @entity21 titles 30 years apart , was knighted while still playing and won 54 @entity23 caps			1
@entity4 , who died aged 85 in 2000 , would have been 100 last sunday			1
@entity24 hears from a former team - mate , an adversary , a famous friend and his daughter			1
sir @entity4 ( left ) won the 1953 @entity16 with @entity15 in what became known as the ' @entity30 ' @entity4 ( right ) is the only player ever to have knighted while he was still alive after @entity4 won two second division titles with his hometown club @entity11 - 30 years apart from each other @entity4 receives an @entity34 outside of the old @entity35 1998 @entity36 - mate at @entity15 people talk about him being @entity23 ’s greatest footballer ; he was certainly @entity15 ’s			1
the success we had was down to his talismanic stature			1
he was the one who attracted the crowds and was known throughout the world			1
dads would take their sons to watch the greatest player they ’d seen			1
@entity4 was a national treasure			1
the first time i was picked for the @entity23 under 23 team , @entity50 — @entity15 ’s manager — sent for me			1
i thought he was going to pat me on the back but he said : ‘ the @entity16 have sent a letter that they want you to play in @entity55			1
have you thanked @entity56 ? ’ i asked why and he replied : ‘ anyone can play behind @entity56			1
’ everyone said what a wonderful passer i was at right back but all i was doing was giving the ball to the great man			1
i never once saw him out of breath			1
that ’s an incredible thing to say because when i came in he would have been in his late 30s			1
when he went back to @entity11 everyone thought that was it but he won them promotion			1
there was an aura around him			1
i picture him with the no 7 on the back of that tangerine jersey			1
most full backs ’ memories of @entity4 will be looking at that number on his back ! he never got booked			1
he never queried a referee , dived , looked for a free - kick			1
and he had some kickings			2
the man known as ' @entity87 ' goes past a @entity89 defender while playing for @entity15 in 1957 @entity4 was a pioneer in taking care of himself before the advent of nutritional advice and sports science people would come to games especially to see @entity4 who was then regarded as @entity23 's greatest @entity4 ( right ) is held aloft on team - mate 's shoulders after inspiring @entity15 's @entity16 victory @entity56 was a consummate pro. he was the first one who really worked at personal fitness			1
in a morning you could go down to the beach at 8am and he ’d be there doing deep breathing then jogging up and down			2
i learned more from him than any coach			2
i ’d just watch him			2
he had quite an amusing streak			2
he could make funny , but cutting , remarks			2
we were playing at @entity110			1
i picked him out with my left foot and instead of landing at his feet it hit his chest			2
my pass gave the defender a good chance of nailing him again			2
when he got off the floor , @entity56 looked straight at me and said : ‘ shocking			2
that shoved some life into me ! the emotion of the 1953 fa cup final came because @entity15 had lost in 1948 and ’ 51			1
this was going to be third time lucky			2
@entity56 would get his medal			2
it was @entity128 year , we were going to climb @entity129 and @entity130 was going to win the @entity131			2
the first two came off and it was @entity56 ’s turn			2
we were 3 - 1 down to @entity134			2
the game was transformed by @entity136 belting in a free - kick			1
@entity4 sprang to life in that last half - hour			1
he told me that i should n’t go around trying to kick people because that ’s not what football is about			2
he said : ‘ once a full back kicks me i ’ve got him			2
i know he ’s frightened of me			2
’ @entity4 puts in a cross for @entity147 to score the winning goal in the 1953 @entity16 final the @entity150 shakes hands with @entity4 ahead of match between @entity23 and @entity153 1949 it was that era just after the war — stiff upper lip			1
@entity56 embodied that feeling around the country			2
that ’s why when we played away from home we knew the crowd wanted to see him			2
for a man to get knighted while he was still playing ... can you see anyone else doing that ? can you see away crowds applauding like they did for @entity56 ? @entity169 at @entity170 @entity56 warmed up with weighted boots on — like diver ’s boots			1
then his actual football boots were made out of calf leather			2
a little firm in @entity177 made them			2
i ’ve never seen boots like them			0
so light , you could bend them into all shapes			0
they only lasted about three games			0
you can imagine the effects of jogging around in weighted boots then slipping on these light boots			0
he could run the 100m as fast as @entity192			0
he was very forward - thinking			0
just before the game he would have a drink of egg , milk and glucose powder			1
his pre-match meal , if you like			0
he said to me : ‘ what ’s your pre-match meal ? ’ i said probably a bit of steak or chicken about three hours before kick - off			0
he said : ‘ why do n’t you try this ? ’ four heaped tablespoons of glucose powder			0
it was a great source of energy			0
@entity4 ' speed can be associated with his training techniques , which included wearing diving boots even after his retirement , @entity4 was a keen advocate of sports fitness @entity4 shres a changing room with ( @entity218 ) @entity217 , @entity219 , @entity220 before farewell game on a monday he would n’t have anything to eat			1
he would just drink eight pints of water to flush his system out			0
these days they call it detoxifying			0
he was very much his own man			0
he would have vitamin tablets			0
all things we never thought of			0
that ’s why he played until he was 50			1
@entity232 was 40 when he packed it in			0
@entity56 went on for another 10 years ! it was @entity235 , captain of @entity15 at the time , who said : ‘ we have this winger who does n’t score goals , wo n’t head a ball and there is no chance of him tackling back , but he is the greatest winger you ’ll ever see			1
’ it was his control and over 10 - 15 yards he was lightning			0
he would just jog up to a full back , drop a shoulder and go outside him and be gone			0
full backs knew what he was going to do but there was nothing they could do about it			0
@entity254 ’ daughter as a little girl i remember him as a loving daddy who did his utmost to keep his family out of the limelight			0
in the 1940s he became the first sporting superstar — acclaimed all over the world despite there being no tv and very little media			0
in order not to be recognised he would wear sunglasses and a hat			0
it never worked ! friday nights were film nights			0
as a family we always slipped on to the back row at the cinema once the lights went down			0
@entity4 with his family ( @entity218 ) daughter @entity279 , son @entity280 and wife @entity281 @entity4 takes on @entity283 midfielder @entity282 ( right ) at @entity284 in 1963 i remember the discipline my dad followed			1
i can see him now , making his carrot juice every day			0
he managed to obtain a tiny juicer			0
all visitors to the house were offered this magical health drink			0
the only trouble was that too much carrot juice could make your skin go yellow ! pop was obsessed with eating the right foods			0
i passed this on to my own children			0
@entity56 ’s granddaughter @entity301 is a leading authority on nutrition in @entity304 and she and @entity305 planned to write a book together but sadly never got round to it			0
i can see him now , doing his deep breathing and stretching exercises before going for his workout on @entity15 beach			1
sometimes he would take me with him and i cherish this time with him			0
his aim was to be the fastest man in the world over 10 yards so that he could skip around the defenders			0
@entity318 @entity11 chairman and friend @entity56 is @entity11 ’s legendary player			1
he was the first football man to become a truly international figure			0
the gates would go up in @entity322 because they wanted to see him			0
it would happen in @entity324 and @entity325 — because they did n’t see him on the telly			0
even now , when i travel abroad and mention @entity11 i hear ‘ @entity329 , @entity4			1
’ the turnout for his funeral was the largest apart from royalty and @entity333			0
@entity4 poses for a picture from his garden , he passed away in 2000 while on holiday in @entity337 @entity23 's ( @entity218 ) @entity338 , @entity339 and @entity340 wear black armbands following @entity4 death the funeral possession of @entity4 passes through @entity11 's @entity344 in march 2000 a statue of @entity4 at the @entity344 was unveiled by @entity346 in 2011 sir @entity347 told me a story			1
he said , ‘ @entity350 ( his brother ) and i used to go to @entity352 when @entity11 were playing and we would stand by the corner flag to get close to @entity4			1
’ i first saw him just after the war as a young boy and i later got to know him well			0
he would come to mine for dinner and eat like a mouse			0
he was a man before his time , intent on prolonging his career			0
he once told me : ‘ one mistake i made was i retired too early			0
i had two more years in me			1
’ he wanted to be @entity362 , he never wanted to grow old			0
even in his 80s he had a spring in his step .			0

sir @entity4 continued playing *professionally* until he was 50
