the @entity9 drew a standing ovation and loud cheers as they walked in to the small arena at the @entity36			1
fans took pictures while press photographers and videographers crowded an entrance to take pictures			0
throughout the game , some fans ignored the action on the floor and watched the president instead			2

the @entity9 sat just behind the @entity13 bench , with the president sitting in between his wife and his friend @entity70			1
