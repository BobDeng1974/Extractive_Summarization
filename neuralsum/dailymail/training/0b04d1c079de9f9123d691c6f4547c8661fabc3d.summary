by @entity0 published : 19:56 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 15 may 2013 the @entity1 today recovered two 2ft - long unexploded bombs which were seen being casually carried along by two men who found them washed up on a beach			1
the pair were pictured with the two potentially deadly rusty 120mm tank shells slung over the shoulders			1
onlookers watched as the men strolled past them with the explosives that date back to the @entity11			1
@entity12 - shocked ! the walkers were photographed taking the tank shells away from a @entity16 beauty spot it is believed the unidentified pair may have seized the bombs to try and later cash in as scrap metal			1
the @entity1 confirmed today following an urgent appeal that the shells had been ' swiftly recovered '			1
the shells were found washed up at @entity23 , @entity16			1
the area is part of the 7,000 - acre @entity26 used by the @entity27 for tank firing practice			2
a woman who took the picture of the pair on her mobile phone , said : ' i thought they were carrying rugs at first but as they walked past i saw they were enormous shells			2
' i was with somebody who used to be in the @entity27 and he said that because their ends were intact , they were unexploded			0
' i was really scared			0
as they were walking past , my little girl was alongside them			2
a spokesman for the @entity1 said the shells would have probably been fired from a chieftain tank despite the copious signs about the military firing range , the pair risked death by taking the shells ' i just think they 're a pair of idiots			1
' another person said : ' what a couple of twits			0
if you see anything like this you should always call the police , not cart it on home			0
' a member of the public posted on a local internet message board that the men were candidates for the @entity69 , a tongue - in - cheek term for people who take themselves out of the gene pool via death			0
however , another poster commented : ' what 's the problem ? one man 's scrap is another 's treasure			0
' a spokesman for the @entity1 said the shells would have probably been fired from a @entity83 tank or a @entity85 anti-tank rifle used by the @entity27 in the 70s and 80s			2
the @entity1 confirmed today following an urgent appeal that the shells had been ' swiftly recovered ' he said : ' these shells have swiftly been recovered and we would like to urge the public using the ranges to keep to the designated pathways and remember that it is potentially extremely dangerous to touch any military material they may find			1
‘ we take the safety of the public extremely seriously and all pathways at @entity26 that are open to the public are cleared of military debris , including shells , before access is permitted			0
‘ a number of signs have been placed on - site warning members of the public of the dangers of venturing from authorised pathways and removing shells			0
unfortunately there are instances where these warnings are ignored			0
’ the spokesman confirmed there have been no charges against anyone involved , but added : ‘ they are being spoken to by the @entity1 police			2

@entity1 had appealed for duo to contact them so they can *defuse* bombs
but *ministry* confirmed today the shells had been ' swiftly recovered '
@entity11 explosives were washed ashore in @entity23 , @entity16
the two men carried rusty 120mm tank shells past shocked families
