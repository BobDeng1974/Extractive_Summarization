this map shows how @entity1 would look if every separatist movement was granted its dream of independence			1
with the @entity10 referendum just days away , the issue of regions breaking away from their traditional rulers is looming large over the continent			0
the map features well - known separatist movements , such as the powerful and vocal @entity15 movement in northern @entity16 and southwestern @entity17 , as well as the more obscure , such as the @entity18 , which supports the independence of the @entity21 region of @entity17 , which has a population of around 405,500			1
the map shows @entity38 split from @entity39 , which has a population of 12.5million			1
@entity39 nationalism has been a strong phenomenon since the incorporation of @entity39 into the state of @entity38 in 1871			2
@entity46 nationalism is a regionalist movement promoting the re-discovery of the @entity46 's heritage , traditions , culture and language			1
the @entity46 existed for 1100 years from 697 to 1797 and was the one of the first modern republics of the world			0
@entity57 dream : demonstrators converge in @entity59 waving their flags symbolizing @entity62 independence - @entity16 is under pressure to allow a november vote to proceed and be legal split : militants of the pro-independence @entity68 party carry a banner and @entity71 flags during a protest in downtown @entity73 , southwestern @entity17 in 2003 , for the self determination of the @entity71 country @entity39 nationalism has been a strong phenomenon since the incorporation of @entity39 into the state of @entity38 in 1871			1
pictured , horsewomen in traditional @entity39 attire by the renown castle @entity82 as they ride to the baroque church of @entity84 in a century - old tradition near the village of @entity87 , southern @entity38 the issue of independence was largely dormant until the 1970s and 1980s , when frustration with taxes , bureaucracy , and the inefficiency of the @entity95 government spilled over			2
separatism movements claim that local wealth is siphoned off for the benefit of a corrupt and incompetent political ruling class in capitals like @entity101 and @entity102			2
the argument has been fuelled in recent years by high unemployment and economic turmoil			0
closer to home we see the nation of @entity109 on the map			0
some @entity112 residents say the county has a distinct identity and should be a nation state with the same rights and political autonomy as @entity10 and @entity118			2
according to a recent survey on @entity71 nationalism , 59 per cent of @entity71 want a referendum on independence , a five per cent rise in just one year			1
@entity124 , leader of the @entity126 separatists , recently said : ' the right of self - determination that is triumphing in @entity46 is the only way to free ourselves from the worst bureaucratic monster of the western world â€“ the bloodthirsty beast of the @entity95 state			0
' @entity10 independence would be a ' torpedo ' to the foundations of @entity1 and wreak economic recessions across the continent , @entity16 's prime minister has warned			1
@entity141 has been trying to quell calls in the northern @entity16 region of @entity144 for a similar vote on breaking away , with his government denouncing such a move as illegal			0
he also confirmed that @entity10 would have to reapply to the @entity35 as a separate member state should it gain independence			0
with the regional government in @entity59 - which has pencilled in a consultation on independence on november 9 - set to potentially give such a vote a green light on friday , the spotlight could turn to @entity144 's drive to cut ties with @entity16 once @entity10 votes			0
last thursday , thousands of @entity62 descended on @entity59 calling for their right to vote			0
responding in parliament when asked if his government would help facilitate @entity10 's integration into the @entity35 if it voted ' yes ' , mr @entity141 said : ' the whole of @entity1 believes these processes are enormously negative			1
' ' they create big problems in areas such as currency , public debt , pension payments ... they produce recessions and poverty for all , ' he said			0
' these processes are a torpedo below the waterline of the @entity1 spirit			1
