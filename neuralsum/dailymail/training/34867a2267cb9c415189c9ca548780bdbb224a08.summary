by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 13:55 est , 15 january 2014 it is supposedly how the @entity3 and @entity4 slimmed down for the wedding of the century and counts a listers including @entity7 , supermodel @entity8 , and @entity10 singer @entity9 amongst its past followers			2
but now the @entity14 diet , brain child of @entity16 and no stranger to criticism , has again been condemned by doctors			2
the high protein , low carb regime has come under fire by the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) who warn that the diet is not nutritionally balanced and may increase risk of long term health problems			1
@entity28 of @entity29 , who personified slim elegance on her wedding , was rumoured to have used the @entity14 diet in the run up to the big day @entity35 's confession that the @entity14 diet was responsible for her trim figure at the royal wedding sparked rumours that her daughter @entity39 ( right ) may also have followed the regime on the @entity42 website , the @entity23 says of the diet : ' rapid weight loss can be motivating but it is unsustainable and unhealthy			1
the @entity14 diet is n't nutritionally balanced , which is acknowledged by the fact that you need a vitamin supplement and a fibre top - up in the form of oat bran			0
' there 's a danger this type of diet could increase your risk of long - term health problems if you do n't stick to the rules			1
the diet lacks variety in the initial phases so there 's a risk you 'll get bored quickly and give up			1
' while they acknowledge that the lack of calorie counting and initial weightless may be appealing to many , they warn that the negative side effects are highly unpleasant			0
' at the start of the diet you may experience side effects such as bad breath , a dry mouth , tiredness , dizziness , insomnia and nausea from cutting out carbs			1
both @entity8 and @entity7 have reportedly used the @entity14 diet in the past to maintain their perfect physiques ' the lack of wholegrains , fruit and veg in the early stages of the diet could cause problems such as constipation , ' the @entity42 website states			0
@entity16 is a complicated four - phase diet that starts with a protein - only approach which promotes weight loss of around 7lb per week			0
the first phase , which lasts for five days , is highly restrictive , allowing you to eat only from a list of 72 low - fat high - protein foods such as chicken , fish and eggs , and bans all carbohydrates except a few handfuls of oat bran			0
in this phase it also highly restricts fats and bans vegetables , unlike other high protein diets like @entity113			1
dr @entity16 is a controversial figure and his diet has come under fire from experts numerous times over the years although most foods are slowly re-introduced over the following three phases , the diet still advises having a protein - only day every week to maintain weight loss			0
this is not the first time the diet has been slated			0
in 2011 experts from the @entity23 named the @entity128 the worst celebrity weight loss plan to follow and said it has ' absolutely no solid science behind it at all '			1
the popularity of dr @entity16 's high - protein diet soared after @entity35 , ( it and it was speculated her two daughters ) revealed she had been following it			1
the following year in 2012 diet guru @entity16 , faced being struck off as a doctor in @entity139 for giving ' dangerous ' food advice to teenagers			1
the celebrity nutritionist was accused of breaching medical ethics for saying slimmer pupils should be awarded higher exam marks than their fatter friends			0
dr @entity16 said that pupils should be able to opt for an extra exam subject called ' ideal weight ' , which they could pass simply by being thin enough			0
in july last year dr @entity16 struck himself off the medical register voluntarily , just before he was banned by @entity139 's medical board from practising medicine and prescribing medicines			1
the 71 - year - old @entity139 , is said to have lied to his patients about the mediator pill , which has been linked to hundreds of deaths			0
sitting in @entity158 , the medical board ruled that @entity16 was guilty of a ' breach of ethical regulations ' for prescribing mediator on five separate occasions , and then lying about what he did			0
@entity16 was also ordered to pay the equivalent of Â £ 5,200 in damages to a former patient who suffered heart difficulties in the 1970s after being told to take mediator , even though it was only intended to treat diabetes			0
presenter @entity170 is one of any celebrities who have praised the 5:2 diet for their weight loss the 5:2 diet , which sees followers fasting for two days a week to lose weigh , has been nothing short of a phenomenon over the past year with stars to politicians jumping on the band wagon			0
the idea that most of the time you do n't have to restrict your intake but can still lose weight is highly seductive , and success stories abound about the eating plan			1
however the @entity23 warns that real scientific evidence of the diet 's success is limited - particularly in the long term - and that the fasting days may result in dire health consequences			1
' skipping meals could make you feel dizzy , irritable , give you headaches and make it hard to concentrate , which can affect work and other daily tasks			0
other reported side effects are difficulties sleeping and daytime sleepiness , bad breath and dehydration , ' the website states			0
it also warns that people should n't view non fasting days as a chance to gorge as this will not only reduce the diet 's effectiveness , but can be bad for your health			1
their overall verdict is : ' the 5:2 is a simple way to reduce calorie intake			0
there are lots of versions of this diet , with some less safe than others			0
many studies on intermittent fasting are short - term , involve small numbers of subjects , or are animal - based			1
those on intermittent fasting diets like the 5:2 must avoid gorging and over indulging on non fasting days ' if you choose to follow it , choose an evidence - based plan based on healthy , balanced eating and written by a dietitian like the " 2 - day diet "			1
' it 's vital for your health to avoid nutritional deficiencies , dehydration and overeating on non-fast days			2
never attempt to delay or skip meals if you are pregnant , have had , or are prone to , eating disorders or diabetes			2
' @entity244 is one of those rumoured to have followed the @entity247 diet in the past this diet is based on the theory that modern diets create too much acid in our bodies which is turned to fat , as well as causing many common medical complaints like arthritis and tiredness			2
despite many ultra slim celebrities such as @entity244 and @entity260 having reportedly sworn by the @entity247 diet at one time or another , the diet has no scientific basis			0
the @entity23 says : ' the theory of the alkaline diet is that eating certain foods can help maintain the body 's ideal ph balance ( acidity levels ) to improve overall health			1
but the body maintains its ph balance regardless of diet			0
' although if you chose to follow a loser version of the diet there can be positives - such as avoiding processed foods , alcohol and sugar - which would also be advisable on any weight loss regime			0
more stringent versions of the diet suggest cutting right back on or even eliminating ' acid producing foodsâ € ™ which include dairy			2
dairy foods provide essential calcium so the @entity23 warns : ' when cutting down on dairy products such as milk , cheese and yoghurt you need to find other calcium substitutes , as cutting out an entire food group is never a good idea			1
' the versions that advise cutting out entire food groups should be avoided			1
' the @entity42 website shares the @entity23 's verdict of many popular diets commonly followed , and the results make for bleak reading			1
from lack of evidence of the diets ' effectiveness to health risks , there seems to be something wrong with nearly every diet			2
but luckily the @entity42 and @entity23 have provided those looking to shed pounds with a diet that they do endorse			1
intended for adults with a @entity319 of 25 or over ( classified as overweight ) , the 12 week plan aims to help you lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 1lb - 2lbs a week			0
they advise that for most men this will mean consuming no more than 1,900kcals a day , and for most women , no more than 1,400kcals daily			2
the plan gives tips and advice , as well as meal and exercise plans , but does not cut out any major food groups			1
the diet advises how to spread your calorie allowance across the day to avoid hunger , but the suggestions can be altered according to your schedule			0
it also gives tips such as eating slowly and away from distractions such as television , as well as eating from smaller plates to make portions seem bigger			2
breakfast : 280kcal lunch : 420kcal dinner : 420kcal other food and drink : 280kcal breakfast : 380kcal lunch : 570kcal dinner : 570kcal other food and drink : 380kcal			2

@entity23 ( @entity356 ) *analysed* popular diets
advise against @entity128 as it 's ' unsustainable and unhealthy '
*caution* against other fad diets that involve cutting out major food groups
they *recommend* *gradual* weightloss through healthy eating and exercise
