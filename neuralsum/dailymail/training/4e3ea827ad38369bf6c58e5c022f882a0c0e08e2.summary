infamous : this silly scene from @entity3 created ' @entity21 ' , after two officers wage a bet whether one can say ' meow ' 10 times during a traffic stop ' @entity61 meow we came out , hit a few guys quickly there , ' he said			1
' we got to get into the corners meow , and maybe pass the puck a couple more times down in the neutral zone there meow			0
