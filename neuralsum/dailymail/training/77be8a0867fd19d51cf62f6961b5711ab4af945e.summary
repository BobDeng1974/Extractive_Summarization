by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 08:24 est , 29 august 2012 weighing in at almost 25 stone , @entity1 had been unhappy with her size all her adult life			1
her typical daily diet consisted of a @entity6 for breakfast , a baguette with lots of butter and mayonnaise for lunch and a greasy takeaway for dinner			1
an endless supply of sugary snacks kept her satisfied throughout the day			0
and in the end it took a life - threatening brain disease that left her unconscious for two weeks and then unable to read , write or even recognise her own son to motivate a dramatic change in her lifestyle			1
now @entity1 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , has turned her life around , having dropped 11 stone and nine dress sizes , and taught herself to read again			1
@entity1 , from @entity25 , before she dropped 11 stone and nine dress sizes after being spurred on to rebuild her life after contracting encephalitis @entity1 said : ' my husband left me and i became really depressed in the summer of 2004 , and ended up getting very run down and contracting encephalitis - an inflammation of the brain tissue			1
' i was unconscious for two weeks and my mum and dad were told i might not come round - and that if i did , i was likely to be severely brain damaged			1
' @entity1 did wake up , but although she recognised her parents , she did n't remember very much else			2
she could n't remember how to read or write and she did n't even know who her four - year - old son @entity39 was			1
' my memory came back gradually , and although i could walk and talk i had to learn to read and write again			0
it was a very scary time , especially for my parents			0
' after making her recovery , @entity1 decided to reclaim her life in every way and began a drastic diet			1
@entity1 , at her current weight , demonstrating how much smaller she is sinc joining @entity49 in 2009 and finding the strength to slim down but finding it difficult to keep the weight off without any help , @entity1 took the advice of a friend and joined her local @entity49 in 2009			2
she recalls : ' i remember i felt very nervous and scared going to the first meeting , and when i got weighed that first time , seeing the numbers on the scale was horrendous			0
i was motivated and positive after the class , but in my head i knew i wanted to lose 10 stone and that seemed so far away			0
' but instead of feeling overwhelmed , @entity1 set small , sensible , short - term goals and lost 10lbs in the first week			2
nearly three years on , @entity1 - whose son @entity39 is now 11 - has dropped 11 stone 3lbs and is close to her dream weight			1
she has also shrunk from a dress size 32 to a size 14 on top and size 18 on her bottom half			0
she says : ' your head and your heart really has to be in it			0
when i signed up for @entity49 i put my heart and soul into it			0
' @entity1 with her @entity82 2012 award which she won after losing over 11 stone since losing weight @entity1 has had such a self - confidence boost that she has rejoined the @entity87 dramatic society			1
' i auditioned to be a dancer in our production of @entity91 in may and got in - it was a massive boost to my confidence and meant i was getting lots of exercise , too Â¬ ! ' but she still gets a shock when she sees photos of her new self : ' my head has n't caught up with my body yet			2
when i saw the pictures of myself in the show i could n't believe that was really me			0
' @entity1 , who was voted slimmer of the year 2012 by her group leader , says that the best advice she has for anyone who wishes to lose weight is to join a slimming class			2
she says : ' take the first step and go to a class			0
the other big bit of advice i would say to anyone is to go to the class every week , you get a lot of support and make friends and nobody judges you			0

@entity1 , *35* , from @entity25 , would often eat @entity6 bars for breakfast
she caught encephalitis after her husband left her
she was unconscious for two weeks , then woke up and did n't recognise her four - year - old son
decided to turn her life around , and dropped from almost 25 stone to under 14 stone
