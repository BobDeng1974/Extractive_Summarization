it looks like any recession - hit high street , with a ladies ’ hair salon , a cut - price tv store and , in between , a disused kebab shop			1
but secreted above the shuttered premises that once sold @entity8 food is an altogether different import from the @entity11 world			0
the cramped flat in @entity13 , @entity14 , is now the centre of operations for @entity18 ’s once - mighty @entity17			1
the @entity17 are reported to have set up their new headquarters above a disused kebab shop on @entity13 high - street it is from here that the controversial @entity25 organisation , expelled from power in a bloody military coup in @entity28 , is plotting its comeback			1
the @entity17 ’s leader , deposed @entity18 president @entity30 , is in jail following last july ’s coup in which more than 1,000 died in street clashes			1
but it still has the support of millions across the @entity11 world and has been given shelter on @entity37 by an @entity39 charity			0
president @entity30 faces trial for alleged treason after being forced from office , but his supporters are plotting a fightback from their @entity14 office yesterday , a @entity17 official denied it was using the down - at - heel premises			1
the man , who would not give his name , told the @entity52 : ‘ this is the offices of a legitimate business and nothing more			0
’ but @entity56 , 68 , the expatriate @entity18 who has run the non-profit @entity58 for more than 20 years , confirmed : ‘ this is an @entity39 charity and we have same values of the @entity17			1
so when their members had to leave @entity18 , we helped them			2
’ regulars at an @entity65 cafe across the road are in no doubt that the flat is the organisation ’s command centre			0
one said : ‘ the @entity17 have been there for just under a year			2
the leaders come and go throughout the day and the evening			0
sometimes you see them coming out with @entity17 banners , on their way to demonstrations			2
