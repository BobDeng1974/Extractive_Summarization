by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 has been recording all of a foreign country 's phone calls , then listening to the conversations up to a month later			1
the program is the latest revelation from a trove of classified documents that former @entity2 systems analyst @entity10 leaked to certain news organizations last year			1
most of those documents have described the @entity14 collecting massive amounts of data and text			0
this program is different in that it records phone calls			0
@entity21 : the @entity2 has been recording and listening to every single phone call made in one foreign country the @entity2 listening program was first reported by the @entity25 , which agreed to not identify the targeted country or other countries where the program 's use was envisioned by officials at the request of government officials			1
this @entity2 program dates to 2009 and is called mystic , according to documents obtained by the @entity25			1
it is used to intercept conversations in one specific country , but documents show the @entity2 intends to use it in other countries , the @entity25 said			1
it records all conversations across the unidentified foreign country and stores billions of them for 30 days			0
the program was n't fully operational until 2011			0
one of the program 's senior managers told the @entity25 that @entity21 is comparable to a time machine , meaning voices from any call can be replayed without requiring the @entity2 to identify a person before the conversations are collected			1
@entity51 : the mystic program is just the latest revelation revealed by former @entity2 contractor @entity10 the conversations swept up likely include those of @entity14 who make calls to or from the targeted country			1
civil libertarians are concerned that this program and others like it will target other countries and that the @entity2 will eventually hold the data longer than what was defined its original charter and use it for other reasons			1
' this is a truly chilling revelation , and it 's one that underscores how high the stakes are in the debate we 're now having about bulk surveillance , ' @entity67 , @entity68 deputy legal director , said in a statement			0
' the @entity2 has always wanted to record everything , and now it has the capacity to do so			2
' the @entity79 would not comment on the specific program described by the @entity25			0
but @entity82 spokeswoman @entity81 said information sought by the @entity14 intelligence community is , in many cases , hidden in the ' large and complex system ' of global communications			0
@entity88 : the release by @entity10 of secret documents on @entity2 spying practices has become an enormous thorn in the heel of the spy agency ' the @entity14 must consequently collect signals intelligence in bulk in certain circumstances in order to identify these threats , ' @entity81 said in a statement			1
she said the presidential directive that authorizes this type of collection ' makes clear that signals intelligence collected in bulk may only be used to meet specific security requirements			0
' the @entity2 is authorized to collect in bulk signals intelligence - the type of intelligence that comes from radio signals and communications , for example , as long as the purpose of the collection is to counter threats regarding espionage , terrorism , proliferation , cyber security , safety of @entity14 troops and transnational crime			2
bulk collection means collecting everything , even if some of what 's collected has nothing to do with national security			0
most of the conversations collected under the @entity2 program would be irrelevant , the @entity25 said			2
' hero ' : while @entity10 is despised by many in both the public and the government , he has become a hero to many who think the government oversteps its bounds with its surveillance practices the @entity2 would not confirm the existence of the @entity21 program			1
but a spokeswoman said that the @entity2 's collection programs are legal and done for national security purposes			2
' @entity2 does not conduct signals intelligence collection in any country , or anywhere in the world , unless it is necessary to advance @entity14 national security and foreign policy interests and to protect its citizens and the citizens of its allies and partners from harm , ' @entity2 spokeswoman @entity147 said in an email			2
@entity147 said it jeopardizes national security when details about classified intelligence programs are made public .			0

the mystic program is the latest revelation from former @entity2 contractor @entity10
media outlets have agree to not specify which country was targeted at the request of government officials
@entity21 gives @entity2 analysts the ability to record every telephone conversation in a specified country and listen to the recordings more than a month later
documents show the @entity2 plans to use the program in other countries
the mystic program dates back to 2009
