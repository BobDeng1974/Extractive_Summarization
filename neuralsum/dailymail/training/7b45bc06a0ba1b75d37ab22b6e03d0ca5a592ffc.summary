she said : ' natural skincare is the essential partner to a healthy lifestyle			2
if you are conscious about your diet and what you put inside your body , then it goes without saying that you would only want to put the very best products , made of the highest quality natural ingredients on your skin			1
' @entity99 , co-founder of @entity100 , added : ‘ we are what we eat and we should all know how poisonous pesticides are so not eating them is easy to understand but our skin is also a living organ and just like the digestive system - it absorbs molecules in skincare that can be potentially harmful			1
' that ’s why we choose organic herbs and plant extracts in our skincare ; going organic for skincare is so important because it not only is healthier but also the skin looks more healthy and beautiful			1
' the celebrities are catching on too			2

@entity129 from the @entity130 said : ' we believe that organic beauty products are better for people and the planet			1
it 's as simple as that			2
certified organic beauty products contain an incredible wealth of plant extracts which have amazing skin caring benefits and do not contain harsh synthetic ingredients which can be damaging to the skin			1
' organic beauty is not just about choosing products that are better for your skin , it ’s about making a choice to care for the world around you			1
the ingredients such as rose , lavender and chamomile that are used in your pot of moisturiser or your body wash were grown without pesticides , which is better for wildlife and also protects the farmers and workers who come into contact with those ingredients			2
' buying organic also means farmers get a better deal and workers are paid a fair wage , helping them look after themselves and their families ( many ingredients are grown in developing countries where poverty is a daily problem )			1
the saying miracle in a bottle is overused in the beauty industry but organic beauty really is that - not just in terms of product performance but the way the bigger picture is part of every product you buy			1
