come the end of this season , @entity1 ’s tenure at @entity2 might just be remembered as one of the costliest appointments in the history of @entity9 football			1
a second relegation in three seasons would be damaging enough for a club that enjoyed eight largely successful years in the @entity13			2
and after failing to secure a single win at home in six months in charge — culminating in a woeful 2 - 0 defeat by @entity18 on monday — @entity1 would certainly shoulder much of the blame for that			1
@entity1 's tenure at @entity2 came to an end on monday following a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity18 @entity23 revealed in august @entity1 was being investigated over ' sexist , racism and homophobic ' texts @entity26 ( right ) appointed @entity1 ( left ) as manager of @entity2 in november 2014 despite the warnings 19 - points taken from @entity1 's 24 matches in charge of @entity2 - five wins , four draws and 15 defeats 0 - number of home games won by @entity1 's @entity2 from 13 attempts - 10 of these ended in defeat 20.8 - @entity1 's win percentage with @entity2 since taking over in november but @entity26 will also have to accept that his misguided decision to appoint the controversial @entity39 in the first place has cost him his reputation and seriously harmed the image of a fine football club too			1
people did try to warn @entity26 when he first entertained the idea of replacing @entity46 with @entity1 last november			2
but @entity26 demonstrated how little regard he had for an @entity49 investigation into an exchange of racist , sexist , homophobic and anti-semitic messages between @entity1 and his former @entity53 colleague , @entity52 , by not only appointing him but then trying to justify the decision with some deeply offensive remarks of his own			1
@entity26 was punished by the @entity49 for his comments about the @entity58 and @entity59 communities and was left with little choice but to step down as chairman , wisely handing the reins to a grandson who can now begin the process of repairing some of that damage			2
it will take time , of course			0
particularly when the response of too many in and around the club was to try to defend the indefensible , refusing to take any responsibility for the problems the club was enduring			0
it could yet prove that the ‘ very difficult decision ’ announced by the new chairman , @entity76 , on monday night has been made too late			0
@entity2 are eight points from safety with only five games remaining , after all			1
this is how @entity23 's chief sports reporter @entity80 revealed the investigation in august 2014 @entity23 led the way with the exclusive story about @entity1 and his @entity53 colleague @entity52 @entity1 was appointed manager of @entity2 in november 2014 but has arguably harmed the football club @entity26 's appointment of @entity1 did little good for the club as they face relegation from the championship how the @entity92 table currently shapes up but it might have become an awful lot more uncomfortable before it got better , irrespective of where @entity2 finish up in the championship			1
as @entity23 revealed last month , an @entity49 investigation first launched last august — with the publication of the @entity101 scandal messages in this newspaper — was close to being concluded in february			1
but new evidence was presented to the @entity49 that forced the governing body ’s disciplinary chiefs to reopen the investigation , with sources suggesting it could be the summer before we have an outcome			0
the @entity49 had already spent months wrestling with the issue of private and public communication , and whether they could charge an individual when the emails and text messages were exchanged between @entity1 and @entity52 in their capacity as manager and head of recruitment at @entity53			1
reports that suggested @entity1 and @entity52 were likely to escape punishment prompted more witnesses to come forward , however , with individuals @entity1 might have considered allies among those to have submitted fresh information			1
despite trouble on and off the pitch , @entity23 understands he was granted a stay of execution in february after a 1 - 0 away victory at @entity132			0
@entity2 were said to be content with keeping their boss until at least the end of the season and sources at the @entity138 indicated @entity1 was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at @entity53 and had been sanctioned to do so			2
and hours before the @entity39 was sacked he talked up @entity2 ’s chances of @entity92 survival , despite overseeing a 10th home defeat in 13 matches			1
‘ it ’s still mathematically possible , ’ insisted @entity1			0
‘ i ’ve got a team which is putting performances in every week			0
it ’s fine lines between winning and losing in this league			0
’ @entity2 vice-chairman @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 look on along with chairman @entity76 ( far right ) during their 2 - 0 defeat by @entity18 new @entity2 chairman @entity76 , pictured reacting to a piece of play on the pitch , saw his club lose on monday hours before being sacked , @entity1 talked up @entity2 ’s chances of @entity92 survival despite the defeat substitute @entity162 and @entity163 struck for @entity18 as they moved up to fifth in the table			1
in their dugout was @entity167 — a man overlooked for the @entity2 job in june 2013 when @entity169 replaced the departing @entity170			0
ultimately , @entity1 lost his job not because of an @entity49 investigation but because he failed to win football matches			2
as a brief club statement highlighted , a return of only 19 points from a possible 72 is disastrous			0
but at least the outcome of the @entity49 enquiries is no longer @entity2 ’s concern			2
at least they can now turn to someone like @entity182 , @entity183 or @entity184 — the names thought to be in the frame on monday night — without the baggage that arrived with @entity1			0
the harm has been done but now begins the recovery			0
@entity18 's players celebrate after @entity162 's goal gave them the lead in the second half against @entity2 @entity18 manager @entity167 was all smiles as he took his place in the stands before the game			1

@entity23 revealed in august that @entity1 and @entity52 were being investigated by @entity49 over ' sexist , racism and homophobic ' texts
@entity1 became manager of @entity2 in november 2014
@entity2 are eight points from safety as they *sit* in the relegation *zone*
the @entity92 club are on the verge of dropping into @entity211
