by @entity0 sir @entity1 will only ride in the team pursuit at the @entity3 as he bids to become @entity5 ’s most decorated @entity4 in @entity6 in 2016			1
the 4,000m four - man event , which takes place in the sir @entity9 on thursday , is one of the few @entity3 disciplines which also forms part of the @entity13 programme			1
@entity14 wants to ride in the team pursuit in two years to try and equal sir @entity16 by winning his fifth @entity13 gold			1
representing : sir @entity1 will be riding for @entity18 at the @entity3 in @entity19 in practice : @entity21 during a training session at the sir @entity9 in @entity19 it would also be the cyclist ’s eighth @entity13 medal overall , a tally that would take him above sir @entity9 to become @entity5 ’s most decorated @entity4 in his own right			1
the @entity29 won six golds and a silver			2
@entity14 said : ‘ i ’d love to get five gold medals - five sounds better than four in terms of being a nice number - and when i was a kid @entity16 was the one who set the standard , really			2
i never imagined that one day i would come close to equalling his medal haul			2
‘ but then to surpass it in terms of all the other coloured medals that you have , and also sir @entity9 , that would be an incredible way to finish			2
' i thought : “ just focus on the @entity13 event rather than try to be too greedy ”			1
i thought i ’d put all my eggs into the one i ’m going to do for the next two years			0
’ lone rider : @entity21 will compete in just the team pursuit at the @entity3 's team - mates : @entity14 ( second left ) was controversially left out of @entity52 's @entity54 lineup @entity14 said training with @entity18 ’s track cycling squad for the past seven weeks had been the ‘ perfect distraction ’ from missing out on a place with @entity52 in the @entity54 - which resumes on tuesday in @entity59 - but said he had been watching it with his son @entity64 , a cycling fan			1
he added : ‘ the road ’s so different			0
it ’s not enjoyable , in some ways			0
you go there and there ’s so much pressure because of who you are in road cycling			0
‘ everyone ’s watching you all the time , whereas you can go into the track and have off days and no - one really sees			0
it was a nice world , refreshing			0
' it was like i had been away for the school holidays and come back to a new year			0

@entity21 wo *n't* compete in *multiple* events at @entity3
he is to focus solely on the team pursuit *competition* instead
controversially left out of the @entity52 lineup for the @entity54
