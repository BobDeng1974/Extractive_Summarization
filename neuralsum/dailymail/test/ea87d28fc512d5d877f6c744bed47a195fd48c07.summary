she uploads them to social media and they are making waves across the university however instead of hiding away her condition , dr @entity31 is using it as a teaching aid			1
her students are required to learn 100 drugs for their course and each day , she will draw a new one on her skin			1

@entity62 is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines under the slightest pressure			2

if urticaria occurs frequently , it is best to take antihistamines regularly every day			2
the lecturer discovered her unusual skin condition after she started working at the @entity10 's school of pharmacy			2
she noticed her skin was itchy and irritated but the doctor could n't remember the name of the condition he thought she had and sent her away with anti-histamines			1

then my friend in @entity111 sent me a link to @entity114 's work and i knew then that was what i had			0

' @entity151 and red marks often appear as lines at the sites of scratching , and generally last for less than one hour			0
' antihistamines are used to reduce the itch and the rash , and are effective in most patients			0
people across the university have began to make requests for designs they want dr @entity31 to draw on herself ' however , antihistamines may not relieve the symptoms completely in all cases			1
' in such cases , other treatments may need to be used in addition , or higher dosages of antihistamines may be prescribed than licensed recommendations suggest			0
' sufferers of dermographism may need to take antihistamines on a daily basis , as long as the symptoms persists			0
usually , the non-sedating antihistamines are preferred as they have fewer side effects			0
' treatment needs to continue until the condition settles by itself which may take years			0
