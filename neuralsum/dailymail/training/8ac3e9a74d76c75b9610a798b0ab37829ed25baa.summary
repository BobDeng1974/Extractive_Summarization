original recipe : although pie and mash shops have modernised , early incarnations of the meal were served with eel pies , potato and parsley liquor serving suggestion : staff at @entity121 , above , stick to the recommended technique for plating up pie and mash by administering ' liberal amounts ' of liquor the addition of some cheap mashed potato and a home made ' liquor ' , which came in the form of a green parsley gravy saw pie and mash become a sit down meal for hungry families			1
it 's simplicity meant that shops could mass produce the hearty meal and serve scores of customers a day with fresh produce			0
after the second @entity4 , eel supplies in the @entity74 began to dwindle causing their price to soar			0
