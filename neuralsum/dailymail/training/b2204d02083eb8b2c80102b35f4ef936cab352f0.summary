by @entity0 @entity2 pair @entity1 and @entity3 were back in training at @entity4 , but @entity1 's future at @entity6 is far from secure			1
the former @entity8 man signed for the club last summer in a Â£ 27m deal after @entity11 failed in their bid to bring in @entity13			2
but , like @entity14 , @entity1 failed to settle in @entity15 and after being left out of the club 's @entity17 tour the 26 - year - old 's future at the club looks in doubt			1
it became clear he was never the then - champions ' first choice and as the criticism increased @entity1 's form suffered			0
the @entity38 offered some brief respite for him - and his performances improved - but after returning to @entity15 and training without the first team , @entity42 may see @entity1 's future as lying elsewhere			0
false start : @entity1 , like @entity47 , failed to really make a mark on his new club last season brute force : @entity1 attempts to use his size to get the ball off of @entity54			0
