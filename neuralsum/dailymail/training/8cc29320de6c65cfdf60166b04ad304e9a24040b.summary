by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 03:05 est , 23 january 2013 controversial : @entity1 , executive principal at the school , has defended the decision to use taxpayers ' money to fund the trip there was a time when a school trip involved an outing to a castle or a museum to mark the end of the academic year			1
but one school is spending £ 32,000 to send 40 pupils and six teachers a little further afield next month – on an all - expenses - paid trip to @entity19			1
@entity20 said the lucky pupils were selected on the basis of attendance records , study records and attitude – and an application letter outlining how the trip could ‘ support the subjects they are studying ’			1
but the four - day , taxpayer - funded ‘ holiday ’ was criticised by teaching unions and a local councillor yesterday , who accused the @entity34 academy of using the expedition to make the school more attractive to prospective pupils and their parents			2
the academy defended the trip as an opportunity to broaden the horizons of pupils who may otherwise be unable to afford to visit the @entity47 city			1
@entity48 , of the @entity49 , said the cost of the trip could pay the annual salary of an extra teacher at the academy , rated ‘ good ’ by @entity55			1
@entity34 councillor @entity56 , who is a governor at @entity57 , said : ‘ the academy , by giving holiday rewards and free uniforms , is trying to increase its numbers at the expense of neighbouring schools , not just in @entity20 but the wider area			2
’ the lucky pupils , who will have their flights and accommodation paid for , were specially selected after submitting written applications to the school stating why they should be given a place on next month ’s trip			1
the decision has been attacked by the @entity49 who say the money could have funded an extra teacher at the school			2
@entity49 regional secretary @entity48 said : ' it throws up issues about access to education and value for money			2
' this is a great opportunity for some children but it means other children will miss out			2
the money being spent could easily fund another teacher			2
' schools are now very competitive and i can understand how schools would see these trips as a high profile event which may attract pupils in a very competitive environment			0
' it is an issue about taxpayers money			0
the amount that is being spent on a number of pupils going to @entity19 could be spent on another teacher			0
' @entity1 , executive principal , has defended the decision to use taxpayers ’ money to fund a select group of pupils to go on the trip			1
she said : ' we think it is a once in a lifetime transatlantic experience			0
we believe this is value for money as a learning experience			0
@entity19 : a far more glamorous school trip than the traditional excursions to castles and historic monuments			1
but 40 pupils at an academy school will visit the @entity119 free of charge at a cost of £ 32,000 to the taxpayer the @entity20 in @entity123 , where 40 pupils have been offered a trip of a lifetime to @entity19 courtesy of the tax payer ' it links very , very closely to their sixth form studies			1
we have students who will be looking at architecture , art , music , terrorism and politics while they are in @entity19			1
' we believe it really will enhance and enliven their learning			1
' our money comes directly from the government and because of the way @entity144 operate there are economies and efficiencies of scale			0
' the school , which has 1,190 pupils , became an @entity20 in 2010			0
it is part of the @entity144 which sponsors 13 secondary and primary schools across the @entity153			0
the @entity20 site is currently undergoing a £ 20 million rebuilding project			0
the @entity20 was rated as good in an @entity55 inspection in october with its leadership and management described as ' outstanding '			0
@entity159 and a level results have improved since it became an @entity20 despite the fact that it is in an area of selective education with the cream of the pupils going to the nearby @entity57			0
the @entity55 report said : ' the academy offers students an excellent range of enrichment activities to broaden their horizons			1
' the sixth form is good			1
this represents an impressive improvement in teaching and achievement since it opened two years ago			0
the pass rate is 100 % in nearly all subjects at a and as level			0
this represents a significant improvement on the results in 2011			0
' all the students who left the sixth form in july 2012 have embarked on further training , education or employment			1
' parents have not been asked to contribute to the cost of the trip			1
it is thought the travel company may have an arrangement with helping out the cost of the teachers			1
@entity144 said in a statement : ' next month ( 6 - 10 february 2013 ) a group of 40 sixth form pupils ( a mixture of year 12 and 13 ) from the @entity20 will be taking the trip of a lifetime to @entity19			1
' pupils wishing to go on the trip had to submit a letter of application to the @entity207			2
' pupils had to highlight a specific area of interest and demonstrate how the trip would support the subjects that they are studying			2
for example , a pupil on the media studies course is keen to explore @entity47 ’s film industry and a pupil studying sport is keen to research @entity47 ’s sporting history			0
in addition , a number of other criteria were applied such as attendance , attitude and whether the pupil was up to date with their studies			0
' on their return the pupils will write a piece about their chosen topic which will be formally assessed			0
' pupils are covering a range of topics covering sport , music , photography , tourism and fashion			0
the pieces of writing will then be showcased at a celebration evening for parents along with photographs and films that the pupils took during the trip			2
' the @entity144 only works in areas of social and economic disadvantage and often pays for pupils to go on trips that they would not normally be able to afford to broaden their experiences and to enhance their studies			1

40 sixth form students and six teachers will be flown to the @entity119
the trip is designed to ' broaden their experiences ' and ' enhance study '
