a court ruling that a jobless graduate was unlawfully forced to do work experience at @entity4 could lead to benefit claimants demanding compensation totalling more than £ 40million , it emerged today			1
@entity7 complained she was subjected to ‘ forced labour ’ which breached her human rights after being told she risked losing her @entity11 if she refused to work for nothing at the discount store			1
the @entity14 yesterday backed key parts of the geology graduate ’s claim and quashed the regulations that underpin the government ’s back - to - work schemes which have helped thousands of unemployed benefit claimants find jobs			1
university graduate @entity7 has today won her @entity23 claim that requiring her to work for free at a @entity4 discount store was unlawful @entity7 was backed by three judges in @entity26 who ruled that the regulations under which most of the government 's back - to - work schemes were created are unlawful and quashed them work and pensions secretary @entity30 called the ruling ‘ utter madness ’ and said he had ‘ no intention ’ of paying compensation to any claimant who declined to join a scheme and had their benefits docked as a result			1
ministers also announced an immediate legal appeal and pushed emergency regulations through @entity43 to prevent the schemes collapsing			2
letters were being sent to one million benefit claimants last night warning them that the ruling did not mean they could pull out of work placements			2
miss @entity7 , 24 , has landed a part - time job at @entity52 following her two - week stint in november 2011 stacking shelves and sweeping floors at @entity4 , which she branded ‘ a complete waste of my time ’			1
she was hailed a hero by @entity59 , general secretary of the giant @entity61 union			0
and @entity63 chief @entity62 said the court judgment ‘ blows a big hole through the government ’s workfare policies ’			0
work experience scheme - for 16 to 24 - year - olds			2
scheme offers a work experience placement with a business for two to eight weeks			0
job seekers volunteer for the course but they must continue to look for permanent jobs			0
these placements can become apprenticeships and lead to potential employment @entity79 based work academy places - @entity81 to people of all ages			1
they are voluntary to join and can last for six weeks , including training and then four weeks ' work experience , tailored to local job vacancies			0
they end in a guaranteed job interview			0
jobseekers can still claim benefits but once they get a place attendance becomes mandatory and face losing benefits if they do n't @entity96 work activity - placements are usually for people who have been unemployed for more than 13 weeks			1
each placement can last up to four weeks			0
people can still receive benefits but can face losing them for 13 weeks if they fail to @entity102 programme - is open to anyone and is the backbone of the government 's back - to - work policy			1
if you are 18 - 24 , nine months after you start to claim jobless benefits you are required to attend the @entity109			1
if you are above 25 years old , 12 months after you start to claim jobseekers ' allowance you are required to attend			0
it is delivered by companies and charities appointed as service providers by the @entity116 work programme - expected to start this year , it will be for those who have been through the @entity109 and have still not found a job			2
participants will be expected to accept ongoing case management or a community action placement - a mandatory six - month work experience placement tailored to your local communities needs			1
anyone who fails to attend without a good reason faces losing their benefits			0
but mr @entity30 said he was determined to press ahead with schemes designed to get people back to work – and would continue to strip benefits from those who refused to take part			1
the @entity135 said : ‘ i fundamentally disagree with the ruling in this case and will fight it all the way			2
our work experience scheme is a huge success and the young people i speak to who have volunteered to take part find it hugely rewarding and helpful			2
‘ people who are fit for work should no longer expect to receive benefits in return for doing nothing			2
we want people to be ready for work and we are trying to help them			0
‘ to try and liken this to “ slave labour ” is frankly insulting to anyone living in oppression around the world and to the hard - working taxpayer here who pays for benefits			0
miss @entity7 had to leave her voluntary work at a local museum and work unpaid at the @entity4 store in @entity165 , @entity166 , under a scheme known as the ' sector - based work academy ' ‘ yet when the government recommends that someone who is out of work and capable of working should undertake a work placement , we are taken to court for breaching human rights ? this strikes me as utter madness			1
’ miss @entity7 , from @entity166 , and 40 - year - old unemployed hgv driver @entity176 , from @entity177 , succeeded in their claims that the government ’s unpaid work schemes were legally flawed			1
their solicitors said the ruling meant that ‘ all those people who have been sanctioned by having their @entity11 ( @entity11 ) withdrawn for non-compliance with the back - to - work schemes affected will be entitled to reclaim their benefits ’			1
the @entity189 last night said up to 150,000 people had had their benefits stopped for failing to take part in schemes			1
in his ruling , @entity193 said he agreed there was an ' important public interest in getting people back to work ' as well as a ' major saving in not having to pay @entity11 , and possibly other benefits			1
' the judge also said he appreciated there could be a substantial saving of public money if effective sanctions are available when jobseekers are not cooperating with proposals			0
he added : ' the secretary of state ’s object in these proceedings is not to end jobseeker ’s allowance but to ensure that it is only paid to those actively seeking employment and prepared to cooperate with attempts made by the state to achieve that end			0
the entitlement to receive the weekly sum should depend on such cooperation			0
' but the judge said it was a matter of ' statutory construction '			0
declaring the regulations unlawful , he said they must be quashed since their central purpose was to impose ' requirements ' on claimants of jobseeker allowance and impose sanctions for failing to comply			0
he said : ' claimants must be made aware of their obligations and of the circumstances in which , and the manner in which , sanctions will be applied			0
' payments can be stopped for anything from two weeks to three years , although the typical sanction for a first offence is four weeks			0
officials refused to say how much compensation might potentially be involved as ministers were determined not to pay a penny			0
but if those involved had their £ 71 - a - week @entity11 payments stopped for an average of four weeks the bill would top £ 40million			1
miss @entity7 said she was ‘ delighted ’ by the judgment , adding that it was unfair for benefit claimants to be expected to work without additional pay			1
she said she had been forced to give up voluntary work at a museum to attend the work experience at @entity4 , which she said had not provided her with any training			1
‘ i do n’t think i am above working in shops like @entity4 , ’ she said			2
‘ i now work part time in a supermarket			0
it is just that i expect to get paid for working			0
’ her claim that compulsory work experience breached her human rights was thrown out by the court			2
@entity193 said he accepted there was an ‘ important public interest in getting people back to work ’			2
but judges accepted her case that the @entity189 regulations underpinning seven back - to - work schemes were unlawful			1
they ruled that the regulations , introduced in 2011 , did not comply with separate laws setting out the power of the @entity189 to stop people ’s benefits			2
claimants were also not given enough detail about what sanctions they would face if they refused to take part			0
the @entity189 said precise figures on the number of people helped back to work by its schemes were not yet available			1
but of almost 65,000 people placed on work experience between january 2011 and may 2012 , about half were no longer on benefits 13 weeks later			0
the @entity189 said studies had found that , after 21 weeks , work experience participants were 28 per cent more likely to get a job than those who chose to languish on benefits .			1

@entity7 has won her @entity23 claim that requiring her to work for free at a @entity4 discount store was unlawful
she and unemployed hgv driver @entity298 , from @entity177 , both succeeded in their claims , in the legal aid - funded case
the move could lead to compensation claims of up to £ 40million
the ruling will not affect the schemes ’ existence but will mean the way in which they are written and enforced will need to change
*lawyers* say today 's ruling could mean those whose benefits were stripped for refusing part in back - to - work schemes could now reclaim them
but @entity189 say it is ' *adamant* there are no grounds for *repayment* '
