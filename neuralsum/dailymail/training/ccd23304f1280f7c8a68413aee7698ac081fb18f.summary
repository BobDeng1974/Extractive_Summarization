@entity0 has revealed how the @entity2 players used footballs as missiles in an attempt to knock the drone that flew over their training ground last week from the sky			1
speaking after the @entity10 opened their @entity12 campaign with an impressive 3 - 0 win over an over-physical @entity14 , the @entity2 captain spoke of this extraordinary incident that brought one of their training sessions to a halt			1
‘ it ’s a good invention , ’ @entity0 said with a smile			2
‘ it looked like a little helicopter			2
very small and it flew well			1
it ’s a good object for journalists , yes ? video : scroll down for @entity2 fans in @entity29 enjoy 3 - 0 @entity12 win over @entity14 @entity30 : @entity0 acknowledges the fans after @entity2 's 3 - 0 victory over @entity14 on sunday missiles : the drone flew over their training ground during a session last week ‘ we heard it and then we saw it			1
we did n’t see anyone controlling			2
maybe they were behind the stand or the hotel			0
but there was nothing we could do to stop it – maybe kick the ball at it			0
but it ’s a big challenge to hit it			0
’ on saturday @entity48 said the matter – something the @entity2 coach described as an invasion of their privacy – was now being investigated by @entity55			1
curiously , a @entity55 spokesperson has said they have not received an official complaint from the @entity10 federation			1
in the same @entity63 press conference a @entity61 journalist insisted his country was not responsible for the small , unmanned aircraft that was presumably armed with a camera			0
‘ no ? ’ said @entity48 with more than a hint of suspicion			1
if @entity14 were responsible – and they continue to vehemently deny it – it did not do them much good here in @entity71			1
was @entity0 concerned on privacy grounds ? ‘ players can do nothing about that , ’ he said with a shrug			1
‘ we ca n’t have control of the drone			1
maybe the guy is from the hotel just behind the stand and you ca n’t see him			0
maybe with a good job of the security we can find him ! ’ brace yourself : @entity86 scored two as @entity2 beat @entity14 in their opening game on sunday harmonious : @entity48 has created a seemingly more harmonious @entity2 camp than before 2002 : @entity2 0 - 1 @entity90 2006 : @entity2 0 - 0 @entity91 2010 : @entity2 0 - 0 @entity92 if @entity86 was among those who launched a football at the drone , he proved more accurate against @entity14			1
this @entity12 has so far seen the big - name forwards make an early impact and @entity86 was no exception , the @entity101 striker scoring twice on his @entity12 debut			1
‘ he had a really good season with @entity101 , winning the @entity106 final , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ that has given him good confidence			0
he played well during the preparation games and he was in excellent condition to play today			0
fumble : @entity14 ' goalkeeper @entity111 spills the ball over the line to give @entity2 a 2 - 0 lead goal - line technology : the ball was ruled in after the decision was taken to video replay for the first time at a @entity12 ' he showed that , scoring two , maybe three depending on the @entity55 goal - line decision , and it was important for him and for the team to start well because he is a decisive player for @entity2			1
maybe he is our key player and he showed it today			0
‘ when you play for @entity101 you have to be a special player			0
he is still young but he is an excellent player			0
he has a big talent and for him this competition is the perfect platform to show who he is to everyone			0
' this was his first game at the @entity12 after being left out four years ago			1
for all players the @entity12 only comes every four years and when you have the chance to play you have to take it			1
' you have to enjoy the possibility to play at your best level and do everything for the team			0
that ’s what every player did today			0
’ seeing red : @entity146 was sent off just before half time after a second bookable offence for flooring @entity148 in the area lucky : but the @entity151 midfielder could perhaps consider himself fortunate for not being sent off himself for an incident with the same player earlier @entity0 said the @entity2 players should be more than happy with the manner of their performance against physically aggressive opponents who were reduced to 10 men before half - time thanks to the dismissal of @entity146			1
‘ it ’s a good start , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ we expected that kind of game and we had a good control			2
it was a tough game physically because @entity14 play very hard , very strong			1
but we stayed very calm and played our own game			2
we created some chances and we scored			2
‘ we have to stay calm because it ’s just the first game			2
we have two more strong games against @entity91 and @entity171 , so it was important to get the three points today to put us in a good position with good confidence			0
i think the next game will be decisive for us			2
‘ i do n’t want to compare to four years ago			0
but for me and everyone it was really important to start well this time and come into the competition with a good performance and a good result			0
