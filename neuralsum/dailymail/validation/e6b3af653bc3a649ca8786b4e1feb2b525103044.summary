one of the first victims to receive an @entity2 payout after being sexually assaulted by @entity3 has spoken out against the ‘ derisory and insulting ’ amount he received			1
@entity6 , 50 , was awarded just £ 3,125 after a two - year legal battle			1
mr @entity6 , who was repeatedly abused by the late dj from the age of ten , told @entity10 : ‘ i would have got more for whiplash			1
' it makes you wonder how many more of @entity15 ’s victims have been fobbed off with such a derisory amount			1
’ victim : @entity6 ( left ) who was abused by @entity3 when he was 10 , was awarded £ 3,125 after a two - year legal battle mr @entity6 said his case was not about the money , but he felt the figure was a snub to all victims			1
‘ what is this going to show to other people in this situation ? ’ he asked			0
‘ do they want to go through years of absolute hell for such an amount ? hundreds of people who have yet to come forward will think , “ i ’m not having my life made into an open book for such a small amount			2
” it ’s a disgrace			0
‘ no money can make up for @entity3 ’s effect on my life			2
but there should be some recognition from the authorities of the damage done			0
’ mr @entity6 added that his payout , which had been contested by the @entity43 , ‘ is probably one day ’s work for the law firm that represented me ’			2
he added : ‘ you hear of celebrities receiving £ 50,000 after having their phones hacked , but how does that compare with being sexually molested as a ten - year - old boy again and again ? ‘ i ’ve been going through this for 40 years and i still feel @entity3 laughing at me			1
’ mr @entity6 ’s award was calculated using a compensation ‘ tariff ’ , which sets payouts at between £ 1,500 for indecent assault over clothing to £ 40,000 for rape			2
victims are entitled to more if they can prove lasting psychiatric damage or repeated abuse			2
the compensation scheme , set up jointly by @entity3 ’s estate , the @entity62 , the @entity2 , children ’s charity @entity65 and lawyers acting for the victims , was finally approved by the @entity68 three months ago			1
payments capped at £ 60,000 have been awarded to more than 200 people who applied			0
each claim triggers payments of up to £ 16,000 to lawyers			0
‘ my law firm was very caring , but they will come out of this far wealthier and happier than i did , ’ mr @entity6 said			0
he added that he was advised he might be able to secure more by continuing his fight in the @entity75 , but decided not to as success was not guaranteed			0
@entity3 befriended mr @entity6 at @entity77 , where the victim ’s mother @entity78 worked as a spinal injuries researcher			1
the abuse happened in the @entity82 and in @entity3 ’s private room at the hospital			1
mr @entity6 recalled : ‘ he used to say , “ this is our secret			0
” ‘ if everywhere was busy he would take me to the mortuary			0
he once pointed at the fridges and said , “ if you ’re a naughty boy for @entity3 , this is where you ’ll end up ”			0

repeatedly abused victim said he would have ' got more for whiplash '
@entity6 said the derisory amount was a snub to victims
feels like @entity3 *'s* ' laughing ' at him 40 years after the abuse
he was *subjected* to assaults at @entity77 where his mum worked
