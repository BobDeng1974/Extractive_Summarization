by @entity0 the lost city of @entity2 may only be a legend , but if these designs are anything to go by then underwater towns could soon become a reality			2
this incredible ' @entity8 ' , which spans four square miles , comes with its own dock , roadways and farms to make it completely self - sufficient			1
it would also feature vertical gardens , a hotel , entertainment complex and a huge floating arena which could host gigs and sports matches			1
the @entity8 has been designed by @entity21 and @entity22 architects and will feature its own docks , roadways and even farms meaning it will be self - sufficient the city will be connected above water with a series of canals meaning eco-friendly boats and submarines could provide most of the transportation the metropolis will be made from a series of hexagonal and triangular modules which connect using walkways and tunnels both above and below the waves the building is made from hexagonal and triangular modules which connect together above and below the water using a series of walkways and tunnels			1
the water world was dreamed up by @entity21 and @entity22 - based design firm @entity43 and commissioned by @entity45 construction firm @entity44			1
a series of canals connect the settlement together , meaning eco-friendly boats and submarines can provide most of the transportation			1
and for when you need to get somewhere quickly , the designers intend to fill the city with electric cars , which will prevent the underwater sections from becoming polluted			2
while there will be trees throughout the underwater metropolis , there will also be two designated areas of greenery for residents to enjoy			0
for those just wanting to visit there will be a large cruise dock to allow tourism and travel to and from the island			0
while trees will be dotted around the oasis , there will also be two dedicated green spaces within the city for residents to enjoy , along with panoramic views of the ocean if construction gets the go - ahead then architects will use the same technology currently being used to build a 31 - mile bridge between @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 if the project were to become a reality , @entity44 will use some of the same technologies they are currently using to build a 31 - mile bridge between @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
@entity89 , architect at @entity43 , said : ' part of that bridge is an underwater tunnel which is joined by a 150 - metre - long precast concrete box			0
' the mega box is cast on a nearby island and floated to site before being connected			0
' we were appointed to work with the engineer to come up with a master plan for a 10 - square - kilometre floating island that can be built with the same technology			2
' the project offered an opportunity to develop a new urban nucleus of world - class residential , commercial and cultural facilities , as well as to promote a zero - carbon , energy - efficient and self - sufficient city			0
' according to @entity108 , the proposal is now being reviewed by one of @entity45 's largest property investors , @entity111 , for a smaller scale project that could be built off of @entity81			0
in order to stop the underground tunnels becoming polluted , and to keep the city eco-friendly , citizens will use electric cars to get wherever they need to go the designers hope the city will become a tourist destination , equipped with a dock large enough for cruise ships , and to allow transport to and from the colony			1
