by @entity0 published : 20:23 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 3 december 2013 textbooks are dying out in classrooms because teachers see them as ' regimented and old - fashioned ' , @entity1 said yesterday			1
the education minister said rampant ideology in schools that teaching should be ' unstructured and free - flow ' meant just one in ten ten - year - olds are issued with them now			1
among 14 - year - olds studying science the figure falls to an astonishing eight per cent - one in 12			0
education minister @entity1 said children 's education is being harmed as teachers are making up their own materials instead of using textbooks the ' anti-textbook orthodoxy ' is damaging children 's education as they are coming home with ' dog - eared worksheets ' that give them no sense of the context of what they are learning			1
some teachers of ' essentially writing their own materials ' by collecting vast amounts of ' different worksheets and bits and pieces of paper ' , she added			0
ms @entity1 was reacting to figures which showed the @entity37 had the lowest use of textbooks out of 50 nations in a survey unions dismissed the claims yesterday , saying constant ' meddling ' in education meant schools were reluctant to invest in books			1
but education experts said the practice was driven by left - wing ideology which allowed teachers to pursue their own agenda			0
the data was buried in a report last year by the @entity56 - based @entity55 showed @entity57 has the lowest use of textbooks among the 50 nations that were surveyed			1
they are used by 99 per cent of teachers in @entity62 , 86 per cent in @entity63 and 78 per cent in @entity64 - all of which outperform @entity57 academically			1
' this country has fallen out of love with the textbook			0
they are perhaps seen as regimented and old - fashioned , ' she said in a speech to the @entity73			0
' i know many frustrated parents who have found bits of worksheets covered in orange juice at the bottom of their child 's school bag			0
' why not have a good textbook that can help lead the parent and the child through the learning of the course ? ' she added : ' i think it 's partly down to issues of ideology and education philosophy ... child - centred learning			0
the idea that there is not a best way to teach something , that actually it should be unstructured and free - flow			0
' official textbooks give pupils ' a sense of ownership over what they are studying ' and allow them to ' catch up or read ahead or study core concepts on their own ' , she argued			1
and the failure to provide children with a book that acts as a ' map or guide ' is creating a ' free - for - all ' that is handing an advantage to @entity57 's international rivals			1
' high - performing countries are creating great textbooks and make sure children flourish only if they understand essential concepts and knowledge , ' miss @entity1 said			1
' in @entity121 , textbooks are a given			2
in [ @entity62 ] @entity62 they 've got a programme where they 're introducing digital books			2
@entity62 , @entity64 and @entity63 all used more textbooks and rank above @entity57 academically they use multimedia content , animations , virtual reality - all of which can be altered to fit each student 's ability level			1
but the actual material is the same			0
' the principle of a good textbook is as important as ever - a structured progression through essential knowledge			0
' @entity141 , the general secretary of the @entity144 teachers ' union , claimed other countries benefited from ' stability ' in their education systems			0
' they can invest in textbooks and plan for the future with confidence			2
schools in @entity57 suffer constant change , meddling and interference in the curriculum , ' she said			1
but @entity158 , of the @entity159 , said : ' textbooks give structure to learning but if you have an alternative agenda they are not always the best vehicle for that			2
' the decline in textbooks has been pretty disastrous			2
children are suffering from death by a thousand worksheets			0

@entity57 had lowest use of textbooks in 50 nations surveyed
minister @entity1 claims children are **n't** being taught *properly*
unions say meddling with curriculum means schools are **n't** *buying* books
