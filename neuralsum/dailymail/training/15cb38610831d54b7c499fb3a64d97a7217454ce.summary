@entity0 last night backed a scathing attack on the internet giants by the new boss of @entity4			1
@entity5 said the prime minister shared the concerns of @entity8 , who accused firms such as @entity10 and @entity11 of turning into ‘ the command and control networks of choice ’ for terrorists			1
mr @entity8 said some @entity16 - based tech firms were ‘ in denial ’ about how their services were being used by fanatics to facilitate mass murder and said they must do more to help @entity4 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity5 said the prime minister shared the concerns of @entity8 , who accused firms such as @entity10 and @entity11 of turning into ‘ the command and control networks of choice ’ for terrorists @entity4 director @entity8 ( left ) said internet firms needed to allow the state to police on - line traffic			1
@entity32 leaker @entity31 ( right ) , revealed intensive collaboration between spy agencies and internet companies he highlighted how @entity37 fanatics in particular were using social networking sites to spread their message of poison – sending 40,000 tweets a day			1
but , rather than providing more co-operation with the security services , the tech companies have become less helpful in the wake of the revelations about state surveillance by the @entity48 fugitive @entity31			1
the new head of @entity4 accused firms such as @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) of turning into ‘ the command and control networks of choice ’ for terrorists the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) said mr @entity8 ’s comments were ‘ wrong ’ and ‘ ill - judged ’			1
but the prime minister ’s official spokesman said mr @entity57 ‘ very much shares the view that ’s being expressed around the use of internet access technologies by violent and extremist groups amongst others , and the need to do more ’			1
in his article in the @entity66 , mr @entity8 said the tech firms must understand that mobile technology and smartphones have massively increased the options available to terrorists			1
he continued : ‘ techniques for encrypting messages or making them anonymous which were once the preserve of the most sophisticated criminals or nation states now come as standard			0
these are supplemented by freely - available programs and apps adding extra layers of security , many of them proudly advertising that they are “ @entity31 approved ”			1
’ an aerial view of @entity4 in @entity84 , in the suburbs of @entity86 , @entity87 : the agency 's new chief says internet firms need to open up even more to state spies sir @entity92 , the chairman of @entity94 ’s @entity93 , backed the @entity4 boss – saying some of the technology firms had an ‘ amateurish ’ approach to monitoring alleged criminal behaviour			1
he even accused the firms of obstructing security efforts with systems that prevent intelligence agencies from being able to find out lawfully ‘ what ’s being said from one terrorist source to another ’ , he told @entity104 ’s @entity105			1
but @entity53 secretary general @entity109 criticised mr @entity8 and instead called for a ‘ full public debate ’ to determine the balance between the right to privacy and need for security			1
he added : ‘ the internet has opened amazing opportunities for communication and business			0
to mis - characterise it as a tool for terrorists is short - sighted			0
internet companies have and will work with authorities to tackle unlawful activity			0
‘ ultimately , the public will be the arbiters of where the line should be drawn between privacy and security			0
for this to happen an honest and frank debate is required based on the full facts			0
the opinion piece from @entity4 falls short of this			2
’ they help our mortal enemies — but could n’t care less says professor @entity139 historically , senior @entity4 personnel have largely remained in the shadows			1
but in remarkably robust language , @entity8 , the new director of @entity4 , has warned how the big , mainly @entity16 , technology companies such as @entity146 have singularly failed to crack down on the disturbing use of internet sites by terrorists , especially @entity151 extremists bent on the destruction of our civilisation			1
from my own work in this field , i know @entity8 is absolutely right			2
@entity37 fighters are the first terrorist generation of the internet age , and the jihadists are becoming ever more sophisticated in their exploitation of computer technology			0
jihadi @entity165 's videos were put on - line they manage their @entity170 videos and craft their @entity11 entries to gain maximum impact and to taunt our security agencies every second of every hour			2
they understand how to get round protective firewalls and spam filters that have been constructed with huge expense and hard work			0
incredibly , during their recent advance on @entity183 in @entity184 , is agents sent 40,000 tweets a day			0
but what is particularly chilling is how western self - styled crusaders for internet freedom , such as @entity191 founder @entity190 and @entity31 ( a former contractor for the @entity32 ) , have ended up helping the jihadists by revealing so much about the methods of @entity194 , @entity196 and @entity16 intelligence agencies			1
@entity31 leaked details via @entity198 about the extent to which @entity4 could monitor electronically transmitted messages and its capacity to search the vast amounts of data to identify information that might help them defeat terrorists			1
indeed , in a development that perfectly illustrates the extent to which our enemies have been technically assisted by these self - righteous leakers , some programmes and apps with high levels of encryption are now advertised as ‘ @entity31 - approved ’			1
six weeks ago , i wrote in this paper about the enormous harm done to western security by @entity31 and @entity190			2
now we have confirmation from the head of @entity4 about the extent of that damage			2
the great danger is that we are at risk as a result of the behaviour of these self - indulgent poseurs who prattle about human rights but care nothing for our genuine freedoms			0
that is why it is so vital that intelligence agencies are given the tools they need to protect us from our mortal enemies			0
in practice , that requires the internet giants to face up to their social responsibilities , instead of colluding , however inadvertently , with the jihadists			0
what is particularly chilling is how western self - styled crusaders for internet freedom , such as @entity191 founder @entity190 ( above ) and @entity31 , have ended up helping the jihadists only a few days ago , for example , the @entity249 , an activist collective affiliated to is in @entity251 , was found to be using @entity11 to distribute images of a beheading , accompanied by a message that glorified this atrocity			1
in their reluctance to help the security agencies , these internet firms have carried their much - trumpeted scruples about online privacy and freedom to a dangerous excess , thereby enabling the extremists to act with impunity			2
indeed , @entity266 and @entity146 have arrogantly announced that they have created operating systems that allow people to permanently lock their smartphones			0
only the user knows the security code			0
@entity266 and @entity146 say they ca n’t break that code , and nor could they help government agencies unlock phones owned by people suspected of having links to terror or criminal groups , even if compelled to do so by court order			0
@entity266 ( left ) and @entity146 ( right ) have arrogantly announced that they have created operating systems that allow people to permanently lock their smartphones similarly , it companies routinely sell high - tech encryption packages that allow people to surf the web anonymously			2
of course , such equipment attracts people who have something to hide			0
bristling with outrage , some of the internet providers seem to enjoy challenging the intelligence agencies			0
recently , seven of them – including @entity295 in the @entity194 and the aptly named @entity296 in @entity297 – joined forces to take legal action against @entity4 over its attempt to investigate secretive networks on the ‘ dark side ’ of the web			1
this is just part of a formidable nexus , made up of tech companies , internet providers and civil liberties groups , along with supporters of @entity31 and @entity190 , which has joined up to fight attempts by governments to tackle online terrorism			1
they are supported by sir @entity315 , widely regarded as the founding father of the web , who has said that allowing intelligence agencies to target data held on the internet would be tantamount ‘ to the destruction of human rights ’			2
but it is absolutely vital that we fight this skewed view of freedom			0
the irony that the internet providers fail to notice is that we will have no liberty at all if the jihadists triumph			0
for its part , i believe , our government has been far too feeble in taking on the companies and dogmatic libertarians , not least because the @entity336 – keen to burnish its modernising credentials – has strong connections with @entity339			0
indeed , @entity340 , a close friend of @entity57 and married to his ex-policy chief @entity341 , is vice-president of @entity146			0
the @entity342 , too , has been equally feeble and deluded , as shown by the appalling decision by the @entity344 – in the name of upholding ‘ the fundamental right to privacy ’ – to let people demand that internet providers remove their personal online records from @entity146 searches			2
far from being a blow for freedom , this showed an orwellian tendency to rewrite the past to suit wrongdoers			0
what ’s more , there is another aspect of ministerial hypocrisy			0
while the government shows deference to high - tech giants , despite mounting evidence that they profit from terrorism , it has cracked down on the press – with the @entity371 inquiry – although newspapers have done a heroic job in exposing wrongdoing in this country			2
the views of the new head of @entity4 should serve as a clarion call for change			2
despite all the phoney outrage from libertarians , @entity31 and tech companies , most @entity194 people recognise the incontrovertible truth that we can never have freedom without security .			1
