by @entity0 a woman who ballooned to 21st was shamed into losing nearly 9st - after she became too fat to go kayaking			1
@entity3 , 41 , from @entity4 , south @entity5 , enjoyed watersports as a child but drifted into bad habits , sometimes eating whole chickens in one sitting or an entire multi-pack of crisps			1
but when the project manager decided to take up kayaking again for her 40th birthday she discovered she was too big to easily slip into a wetsuit			2
@entity3 at her biggest when she weighed 21 stone ( left ) and more recently at 13st 1lb ( right ) she embarked on a new active lifestyle and has dropped from 21st 9lbs to 13st 1lbs			1
' i bought all the gear to kayak and paddle board but quickly realised i was spending more time preparing for it than actually being out on the water , ' she said			0
' i was always too tired by the time i got in the water			0
and of course a part of me always worried i would get stuck in the wetsuit ! ' @entity3 , who lives with her husband @entity30 and their three cats , said while she had always eaten relatively healthily , her downfall was large portions			2
' i did n't go from eating pizza and chips to broccoli and chicken overnight , the difference is beforehand i might have eaten the whole chicken			0
' it was the amount i was eating			0
i grew up in a healthy family so i ate meat , vegetables , pasta and things like that - but just huge portions			2
' @entity3 drifted into bad habits like eating whole chickens in one sitting or an entire multi-pack of crisps after taking up running the weight began to fall off , and @entity3 , who has no children , is now training for her 27th park race			1
she used to squeeze into size 28 clothes but has now dropped to size 14 and completed two half - marathons , three 10k races and 26 5k races			1
but unlike other dieters , the super slimmer said maintaining a healthy appetite and diet was what worked for her			0
eating 2,000 calories a day , she runs , cross trains and does weight lifting on a regular basis			1
@entity3 hiking during her weight loss			2
she took up running the weight began to fall off she has completed two half - marathons , three 10k races and 26 5k races ' it 's not about fad diets or 1,200 calories a day , ' she said			1
' i 'm never hungry , if i was then i could n't do it			0
i think a lot of people do it , they crash diet and fail			0
' it 's easier than people make out			0
for me i 've not found it impossibly difficult because i 've not deprived myself of anything			0
' @entity92 skipped or a bacon sandwich lunch : sandwich , crisps and a chocolate bar dinner : a huge portion of meat , potatoes and veg snacks : crisps , chocolate and biscuits throughout the day breakfast : granola bar and protein shake ( usually following an early gym session ) lunch : huge green salad with low - fat cottage cheese and a small portion of prawns dinner : fish or chicken with lots of steamed or roasted veg snacks : the occasional chocolate bar in just 14 months @entity3 has completed an incredible physical transformation and lifestyle overhaul			1
