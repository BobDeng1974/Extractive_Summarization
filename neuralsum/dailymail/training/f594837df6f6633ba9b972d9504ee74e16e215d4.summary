this is the dramatic moment a diver in the @entity2 had a very close encounter with a fearsome lemon shark			1
the 2.5metre long fish is shown baring a menacing set of teeth as it breaks the surface at @entity9 during sunrise			0
photographer @entity11 captured the shots during an eventful dive when the lemon sharks suddenly appeared within millimeters of his camera			1
up close and personal : the lemon shark bares its razor sharp teeth to the camera in these dramatic shots jaw - dropping : the lemon shark was pictured breaking the surface of the water at @entity9 in the @entity2 fearless : photographer @entity11 captured these images during a dramatic dive with lemon sharks several of the dangerous sharks appeared fascinated by their aquatic companion and decided to take a closer look			1
the results are these beautiful images which could n't paint are more intimate picture of one of the sea 's most feared creatures			2
@entity11 said : ' it ’s a difficult moment to capture because it is unusual to see sharks breaking the surface but at @entity9 in the @entity2 the sharks get very excited around divers and make very close passes			1
' surprisingly , @entity11 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , has never once been bitten throughout his dangerous expeditions underwater			1
and he does n’t even take precautions when underwater with the sharks			2
he explained : ' i did n't feel the need for chainmail or other armour but i always wear a dark wetsuit and dark gloves just in case the sharks mistake my hands for bait			1
i also try to stay calm and avoid erratic jerky movements that might be interpreted as an animal in distress			0
' almost finished : the lemon sharks appeared naturally curious of the cameraman @entity11 underwater friend : lemon sharks have been known to attack humans but none have been fatal ' the shark seemed wary of me but tolerated my presence			1
i say tolerated because it clearly outranked me from a size perspective			0
i believe that the shark thought of me as another predator ; albeit a clumsy one with strange flashing appendages			0
' @entity11 , who runs diving adventures company @entity75 , came so close to the sharks on this dive he said they were touching his equipment			2
' the lemons were practically bouncing off my underwater camera , but they showed no aggressiveness towards me during this photo shoot , ' he said			1
' they have never shown me any hostility			0
after nearly two decades of swimming with sharks , it has become quite clear to me that they are not interested in divers as a food source			2
we generally bring bait to attract the sharks to the boat and thats the only reason they come so close			0
' the lemon shark , which is found in tropical waters around the @entity98 and @entity99 , derives its name from its distinctive yellow colouring			0
although the species has been known to attack humans , none have been fatal and they generally survive well in captivity .			0
