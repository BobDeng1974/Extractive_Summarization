a maths teacher waded into a shallow river and captured a 17ft anaconda hours after it snatched his friend 's dog from the bank			1
@entity7 , who lives in @entity8 , @entity9 , hauled the 175lb snake onto land in nearby @entity12 , after a friend phoned him with news of his beloved pet , @entity16			2
capturing a snake that size , the 39 - year - old said , was ' a dream come true '			1
he added : ' since i was 10 years old i have liked handling reptiles but this was the biggest snake i had ever seen and i had ever caught			0
' mr @entity7 asked his friend to help capture the anaconda , by grabbing its tail , ' otherwise it could strangulate me '			1
but because it was still digesting the dog , mr @entity7 said , it was ' very calm before i touched it '			2
mr @entity7 , right , holds the anaconda 's head as he and his friend drag it from a river in @entity9 onlookers gasp in amazement as mr @entity7 ' prized catch , which has now been blindfolded and restrained with a t - shirt , is captured on film mr bascoules brave son , @entity64 , five , puts his ear to the belly of the beast @entity64 crouches next to the giant reptile which is spread out across the lawn of his family home mr @entity7 holds the anaconda 's tail as his children , from left , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity64 , sit around the snake , and @entity79 stands behind it , to complete the novel family photo after blindfolding the wriggling reptile with a t - shirt mr @entity7 put it in his bathtub to store over night - but not before his three children , @entity76 , 11 , @entity86 , eight , and @entity64 , five , could pose for pictures with it			1
mr @entity7 said by the time he had captured the snake , it was too late to re-home it away from the residential area , so he decided it could spend the night at his family home			2
not everyone was a fan of the house guest , he said : ' my wife was worried it might escape from the bathroom during the night			0
he added : ' we did n't have to be worried because i put it a cloth on his head so it was blind and became like a big worm			0
' mr @entity7 said once the snake was blindfolded with a t - shirt it was turned into a ' giant worm ' mr @entity7 , who has caught 15 - 20 anacondas , described capturing one this big as ' a dream come true ' the next day mr @entity7 released the anaconda six miles away into a river close to swamps where the creatures are often found			1
the incredible event unfolded last year but video of the remarkable capture and release exercise has only just emerged			0
mr @entity7 , originally from @entity122 , has lived in @entity9 for 15 years , and works part - time as a tour guide			2
he said he chose the area because of its fauna - particularly reptiles and amphibians			0
mr @entity7 said snakes were ' really common ' in @entity9 , where there is 98 species			0
not surprisingly , this is n't the first time mr @entity7 has captured an anaconda			1
he estimates he 's caught 15 - 20 .			0

@entity7 captured the anaconda because it ate a friend 's dog
the 39 - years - old described the catch as ' dream come true '
he asked his friend to hold the snakes tail so it would n't ' strangulate me '
after pulling it from the river his young children posed for pictures with it
the anaconda was then stored *overnight* in the family bathtub
