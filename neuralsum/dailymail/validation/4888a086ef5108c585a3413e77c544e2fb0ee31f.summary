most children can be prone to temper tantrums if they do n't get their own way but @entity3 , nine , has become so aggressive , even her own mother is terrified of her			1
single mother , @entity6 , 47 , from @entity7 , says her daughter 's behaviour can be so unpredictable she dreads outings and special occasions like birthday parties , and she feels like a victim of domestic abuse because of the daily barrage of abuse she gets at home			1
' her behaviour has deteriorated from being a normal child to attacking me on a daily basis			2
very few people have seen her that way as it 's behind doors , ' @entity6 told @entity24 show my violent child			1
@entity26 , pictured on @entity24 show my violent child , has suffered physical abuse from both her son and daughter and wonders if her parenting skills are to blame @entity33 , now 11 , pictured as a young boy with twin sisters @entity36 and @entity37 , now nine			1
@entity33 could be aggressive at this age as it was before he was diagnosed with @entity40 and @entity41 ' she can be a complete @entity43 - one minute she 's a loving child and the next she can turn , biting , pulling hair , trying to pull my earrings out , punching , kicking , trying to break things			1
' she is only a tiny little thing and she goes through this thing and it scares me			0
i have been attacked at least 30 times in one day			0
it can be for any reason			0
' the @entity24 show goes into their home to reveal how @entity36 can be aggressive - both physically and verbally - over the smallest of things if she does n't get her own way			1
during one outburst , she is seen shouting at her mother : ' it 's not f * * * ing working , do n't f * * * ing talk to me ' over a toy and when her mild - mannered twin sister , @entity37 , tells her to ' stop being silly ' she retorts : ' shut up you b * * * * ! ' @entity6 is at the end of her tether as after @entity33 was diagnosed , @entity36 then started acting violently			1
' it feels like i am in domestic violence with my kids , ' she said in another shocking scene , she bites her mother 's face during a meltdown over homework and then sobs in her arms because she 's sorry for what she 's done			2
' i do n't understand why i get angry , i hurt people and i kick them , ' @entity36 said			1
it 's not the first time @entity6 has experienced physical abuse at the hands of one of her children			2
as previously reported by @entity88 , @entity6 found raising her son , @entity33 , now 11 , a real challenge as he was prone to regular violent outbursts and he once stabbed her with some scissors			1
at the age of five , he was diagnosed with @entity40 and @entity41 ( @entity41 ) and put on anti-psychotic medication			1
' before the diagnosis he could be really violent , he stabbed me with scissors , he tried to strangle me , he could be violent punching , kicking and swearing , ' @entity6 recalled			1
@entity36 hugs her mother after regretting biting her in the face during one violent outburst filmed by the @entity24 documentary @entity33 has calmed down thanks to his diagnosis but @entity6 now faces another violent battleground with @entity36			1
after the problems she experienced with @entity33 when he was younger and now @entity36 , @entity6 said : ' it feels like i am in domestic violence with my kids			1
' they have taken the role of the abusive partner			0
this ca n't go on , i do n't know how to deal with it			2
' i try my hardest i put my all into everything for them and they just seem to fight me all the way			0
' @entity6 often has to retreat her to bedroom in fear of her children 's behaviour and is left in tears over what she can do to bring harmony to their home			2
' i do worry that it 's me , where did i go wrong ? i do the best i can do at as a mum but i worry it 's down to my parenting skills , ' she admits			0
caught in the firing line is her other daughter , @entity37 , who often retreats to sit on her own when her sister 's tantrums begin and is often at the receiving end of her verbal abuse herself			0
trying to play a simple games of cards with her sister can result in her being sworn and shouted at			0
the single mother - of - three often retreats to her room to hide from her aggressive children @entity147 , a parenting practitioner who helped @entity6 when she struggled with @entity33 , returns to help the family again now @entity36 is causing problems			1
she said @entity6 needs to establish a routine , set more ground rules and be more assertive			1
she advised @entity152 to work on her own self - esteem as her lack of confidence in her parenting is holding her back			0
' at the moment the children are on control and that 's a very unsafe place for children , ' she said			0
she observed that @entity37 was often the victim as she withdraws to find a corner to sit on her own while her mother and sister fight			0
@entity147 said : ' @entity36 has learnt a pattern of behaviour that if she wants attention , this ( being violent and aggressive ) is the way to get it			1
@entity6 is urged by a parenting practitioner to be more assertive and self - confident - she has let her children take too much control ' it 's like a dripping tap , little by little we have to get mum to be more assertive			2
@entity6 needs to focus more on @entity37 , that retreating is n't good for her			2
' the family are taken for ' intensive weekend intervention ' at an outdoor activity centre in the @entity180 to help them			0
@entity147 said : ' from experience , it helps to taken them away from a familiar environment where they have to break familiar patterns of behaviour			0
' during the weekend , the family do role play exercises where they recreate arguments taking the part of each other so they can see the situation from the other person 's perspective			0
they also take part in survival activities in the forest and games where they have to work together			0
a weekend away with her twin girls proves a revelation as @entity6 finally starts being the boss the activities all work towards @entity6 reestablishing control instead of letting @entity36 take charge			1
the mother is amazed by the transformation in her children 's behaviour when she is the boss			2
she said : ' when i have made a suggestion they have n't kicked off and have listen to what i have said which is a good thing			0
now i 'm in my element , i 'm really happy			0
' the one thing i will take home is positivity , their behaviour has been amazing			0
' @entity147 says she 's hopeful @entity6 ' will now go from strength to strength ' and take what she had learnt back into the home environment			2
my violent child is on @entity24 this evening at 9pm or catch up on demand			1
