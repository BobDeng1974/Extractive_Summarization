@entity45 and tumble : the teenager risks life and limb , scaling high buildings , leaping off objects and standing on his head , to indulge his passion for free - running ' it got to me when i started secondary school , ' he said			1
' i did n’t realise it would be as bad as it was			2
the kids would pick me up without asking me and joke about me getting into my bag			2
' they ’d call me mini-me and midget			2
' in the end , it was sorted out when i flagged it up to the teacher			2
' now if someone asks what is wrong with me , i just tell them			2
i even went to a college to talk about my condition and everyone understood it a lot more			2
' i have n’t really seen anyone else in the city with my type of dwarfism			1
' head over heels : 3ft 1ins tall @entity9 took up the extreme sport of free - running in order to keep fit ambition : @entity9 has never let his height prevent him from fulfilling his love of playing sport and keeping active @entity9 now works part - time as a junior administrator at @entity87 , in @entity88 , @entity89 , and is to start at @entity90 in september			1
he said his love of free running stemmed from a desire to keep fit			2
' a friend started doing it and i was n’t very fit so i thought i ’d do it to improve myself			0
' it is really difficult and it involves climbing really tall objects			1
' the tallest is probably around 20ft high			0
' @entity9 ’s condition was diagnosed after he was born nine weeks early at @entity26 ’s @entity102			1
his 5ft 2ins mum , administrator @entity103 , 42 , said : ' around two days later , a doctor noticed there was something wrong with his bone structures			0
' he said it seemed to a be a genetic mutation and asked if there was dwarfism in the family			1
' his parents were told he had skeletal dysplasia and more tests were carried out to find out what type of dwarfism he had			1
but doctors were baffled as he had the chromosome normally missing in those with the condition			0
diagnosis : @entity9 , pictured aged three , with his one - year - old sister , was diagnosed with a rare form of dwarfism shortly after he was born @entity103 added : ' at the time it was devastating			1
this was n’t picked up during the 20 - week scan when i was pregnant			0
' we did our own research to find out about how it would affect him			0
' there were lots of support groups for people with dwarfism , including the @entity141			1
' but we are quite independent			0
@entity142 and i wanted to give him the best upbringing possible and did n’t want him to feel any different			0
' but the differences in @entity147 became more noticeable as he got older , especially why he stands next to dad @entity142 , 47 , who is a strapping six - footer			0
' he started walking at about 13 months like others , but he looked like a baby chicken , ' @entity103 said			0
' his gait was different , too			0
but cognitively he was fine and was a typical baby in many other ways			0
' he is stared at every day			0
i can take it from children , but i find it difficult from adults			0
' sometimes people will stop their car just to look at him			2
people think he ’s just like @entity163			2
' @entity103 said of one incident : ' about ten years ago , a man on his scooter saw @entity9 and put his little finger to his mouth as the character does in the movies			1
' i said to him : " how dare you ? you would n’t take the mickey out of someone with a different disability like that "			0
' i still feel that way			0
no other disabled person would be treated that way , but people think they can poke fun at those with dwarfism			1
' i have even come across people who are scared of those with the condition			2
the word midget is highly offensive too and has no place in today ’s society			0
