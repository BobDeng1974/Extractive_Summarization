@entity0 returned to their blue kit and duly ended a five - game run without a @entity4 win with a 1 - 0 victory over @entity6			1
@entity8 's first - half header proved enough to cap an emotional day in front of a bumper crowd at the @entity11			1
the @entity12 played in front of their second highest home attendance of the season just 24 hours after the decision by club owner @entity17 to finally back down over his controversial change of team colours			2
@entity0 supporters celebrate the clubs return to blue during the game on saturday goalscorer @entity8 ( right ) celebrates with @entity0 boss @entity23 at full time and any hopes those supporters had that a return to blue from red would bring good fortune appeared promising as they opened the scoring in the 14th minute			1
@entity29 launched an arching throw into the box and @entity8 's header had enough to cross the line despite @entity34 getting a hand to it			1
@entity0 tried the same again seven minutes later with another throw - in by @entity29 but this time @entity6 's @entity38 was on - hand to block @entity40 's header at the far past and then turn @entity43 's effort for a corner			1
@entity45 used to score plenty of goals for @entity0 and looked to pull the strings for @entity6 behind the two strikers while @entity50 had a decent effort from distance that had @entity53 , in for the injured @entity54 , at full - stretch			1
@entity56 provided plenty of width for @entity0 , forcing @entity59 into conceding an early booking , and he almost set - up @entity61 for an easy finish			2
however @entity38 was again on - hand to snuff - out the danger shortly before half - time			2
@entity38 ( left ) of @entity6 and @entity65 of @entity0 in action @entity43 ( left ) of @entity0 and @entity67 of @entity6 vie for the ball it was the last telling contribution by the busy @entity71 striker , who failed to emerge from a knock for the second half			1
he was replaced by @entity75 , who made his debut following his move from @entity78 , and the tall striker almost made a swift impact with a lay - off for @entity82 , who fired wide from the edge of the box			0
left - back @entity85 also made his first appearance after joining from @entity87			0
@entity43 felled former team - mate @entity45 , who fired his free - kick on target but lacked the speed to beat @entity53			2
@entity92 rang the changes in a bid to spark his team into life with a double substitution , @entity67 and @entity98 both coming on and were soon followed by @entity99			0
but it proved a fruitless effort from the @entity103 boss			0
@entity0 dominated possession and territory but could not find a second goal to ease the pressure for the final stages			0
@entity56 and @entity29 combined on the edge of the box but could not find a shot between them			0
@entity40 rose highest at a corner only to head his effort over the bar while @entity75 fired a volley wide			0
@entity6 launched a series of attacks in the closing stages but lacked the touch to find a late equaliser .			0

@entity8 's first - half header enough for @entity0 to beat @entity6
@entity12 fans celebrate return to their *traditional* colour for the first time
@entity0 end five - game run without a win in the *championship*
