by @entity1 reporter published : 08:37 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 08:46 est , 8 may 2013 @entity3 's fashion workshop at @entity4 has been cancelled because the shamed designer refused to participate in ' a frank discussion of his career ' with students			1
the shamed designer - who was forced out of his role as creative director for @entity11 after footage of him making racist and anti-semitic comments emerged online - was set to lead a three - day course titled ' @entity15 ' at the @entity17 institute			1
however an email sent to students states that @entity20 - based mr @entity3 , 52 , refused to compromise with the requests made by the teaching facility back to the day job : @entity3 's workshop at @entity4 has been cancelled in the email , obtained by website @entity26 , @entity4 writes : ' it was a condition of our agreeing to host mr. @entity3 that we also hold a larger forum , which would include a frank discussion of his career			1
' ultimately , an agreement could not be reached with mr. @entity3 regarding the details of that forum , and so the program will not move forward			2
' the masterclass was set to include a three - day workshop and a final assessment carried out by mr @entity3 and @entity39 , @entity40			1
its cancellation comes shortly after an anonymous petition , now holding over 2,000 signatures , was launched in a bid to ban mr @entity3 from teaching			1
keeping his head down : mr @entity3 , who was the head designer at @entity11 for 15 years , has kept a low profile since his arrest , attending rehab for alcoholism and doing a temporary residency at @entity52 it reads : ' it does n't matter if it 's for three months or three days , hiring someone who has made such horrific comments shows that the school values @entity3 over their entire @entity58 student body			1
' it shows they value him over their students ' respect , peace of mind , and heritage			0
it is disgraceful to hire someone who has made such inhumane comments			0
' it also triggered a torrent of commentary			0
one person wrote on the website : ' by letting him back into the broad public influence , it sends the wrong message that his anti-semitic remarks can be swept under the rug			0
' another stated : ' a teacher 's ethics are inherent in what they teach , and i do not feel that @entity3 is the kind of person that should be teaching young minds			2
' questionable ethics : the petition made reference to mr @entity3 's disrespect towards the entire @entity58 student body at @entity4 , located in @entity17 's @entity94 the @entity3 - taught class was previously described as ' a dynamic and intimate opportunity for students to learn from an immensely talented designer			1
[ and ] about the challenges and complications of leading a design house in the 21st century			0
' the letter goes on to acknowledge the designer 's sordid past			0
' we believe that over the past two years @entity3 has demonstrated a serious intent to make amends for his past actions , ' it stated			2
mr @entity3 was arrested in february 2011 after a video showed him uttering anti-semitic remarks to group of people at a @entity20 cafe whom he assumed were @entity58			1
' i love @entity118 , ' the designer slurs drunkenly in the clip			0
' people like you would be dead			0
your mothers , your forefathers , would all be f * * * * * * gassed , ' he continued			0
since the scandal , mr @entity3 has attended rehab for alcoholism and carried out a temporary residency at @entity52 , where he received rave reviews for his contribution to the designer 's fall 2013 show .			2
