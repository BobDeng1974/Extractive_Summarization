@entity0 are quitting their jobs at the fastest rate since before the economic crash			1
the sharp spike in the ' quits rate ' means workers feel more optimistic about finding a new job on the market			1
other data on thursday showed the number of new jobless claims rose last week but remained near a 14 - year low , and the two readings suggested the @entity0 labor market was moving toward full health			2
good sign : analysts say workers were afraid to leave their jobs but the recent spike will force employers to offer competitive wages to retain talent			1
around 2.8 million workers left their jobs in september two percent of @entity0 job - holders , or about 2.8 million workers , left their jobs under their own volition in september , the @entity26 said - a dramatic rise in comparison with recent months and years , as detailed in a graph by @entity32			1
it means employers , who have not had to raise wages to retain talent , may be forced to boost salaries			1
secondly , @entity40 chair @entity39 has signaled the quits rate as an indicator she is following on her ' dashboard ' for assessing progress in the labor market 's recovery			1
the report follows figures last week that showed employers added 214,000 jobs in october after a 256,000 advance the prior month that was larger than first estimated			2
the unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent , the lowest level since july 2008 , from 5.9 percent the prior month			0
the october data lifted the monthly average employment gain so far in 2014 to 228,500 , which would mark the strongest year since employers added an average 264,750 per month in 1999			0
across the entire year , 5.03 million employees were added to staff , boosting the hiring rate to 3.6 percent and matching july 's reading as the strongest since december 2007 , the @entity26 reported today			2
' the good news in this report is really the fact that there 's more fluidity in the labor market , more activity there , ' said @entity68 , an economist at @entity69 in @entity70			0
optimism : workers feel optimistic that they can leave their job and find another , the @entity26 says ' people are ready to take more risks and seek jobs elsewhere			1
' in a separate report , the @entity26 said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to 290,000 for the week ended nov. 8			0
that was a bigger increase than expected , but claims have now been below 300,000 for nine straight weeks , suggesting firms are well past a cycle of elevated layoffs that began in the recession			0
' this increase is nothing to worry about , ' said @entity86 , an economist at @entity87			0
' claims can remain close to their current trend for an extended period			0
' yields on @entity0 government debt were little changed following the publication of the two @entity26 reports .			0
