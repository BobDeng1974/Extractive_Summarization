@entity1 , you have been warned			0
prepare for an uncomfortable evening on the south coast on wednesday			0
you would have forgiven @entity3 for being a little preoccupied by their upcoming @entity5 quarter - final glamour tie			2
not one bit of it			0
with five goals and five different goalscorers , they surged to the @entity12 summit and confirmed what we already suspected			0
the midweek trip here to take on old pal @entity17 will be far from easy for @entity18 and his mis - firing @entity19			0
@entity3 's @entity20 ( centre ) celebrates scoring during the @entity22 on saturday @entity20 put @entity3 1 - 0 up against @entity23 after just one minute on saturday @entity24 ( right ) celebrates making it 2 - 0 as the championship game saw a flurry of goals @entity3 : @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity20 ( @entity34 , 90 ) , @entity35 , @entity24 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 , 59 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 , 90 ) subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 bookings : none goals : @entity20 ( 1 ) , @entity24 ( 43 ) , @entity36 ( 45 ) , @entity38 ( 67 ) , @entity39 ( 89 ) @entity23 : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 45 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 , 71 ) , @entity61 subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 bookings : none goals : @entity59 ( 45 ) , @entity51 ( 48 , 78 ) referee : @entity71 ( @entity72 ) attendance : 10,440 ( 1,357 away ) they are a superb attacking force with goals coming from everywhere			1
@entity20 , @entity24 , @entity36 , @entity38 and @entity39 all scored here in a splendid advert for @entity12 football			1
that @entity23 kept it so close for so long was testament to their fighting spirit - goals from @entity59 and two towering headers from @entity51 made things interesting - but in the end they were deservedly beaten			1
it is an indication of @entity3 's belief they can challenge for @entity89 promotion that all mentions of wednesday night 's big match were banned			2
the @entity5 was for another day			0
@entity17 did n't give it a mention in his programme notes , nor did captain @entity31			0
with @entity95 beating @entity96 2 - 0 at lunchtime , the @entity94 knew they could finish the afternoon on top of the table and , despite the lure of @entity1 's visit , @entity17 did n't rest any players			1
@entity103 also sent out an unchanged team but to the displeasure of the travelling hordes from the @entity108 capital , they were dressed in all - white			0
' are we @entity110 in disguise ? ' was one of the more printable chants directed at owner @entity114			0
wearing the colours of your bitter rival aside , their mood had been soured just 38 seconds in			0
from the game 's first attack , @entity3 led when @entity39 darted down the left and played across a ball that fell perfectly for the onrushing @entity20 to drill into the bottom corner			1
it was his third in four games			0
' we score when we want , ' crowed the jubilant home support			0
and very early , too , it would seem			0
@entity23 's @entity59 ( right ) scores his side 's first goal of the game to make the score 2 - 1 @entity59 runs back to the half way line after scoring for @entity23 on saturday the hosts set the early tempo , with @entity33 a willing runner from left - back in support of the creative players			1
likewise @entity30 on the right and his cross was deftly taken down by @entity36 , whose shot was struck into the ground and bounced kindly for @entity49			2
@entity23 's form has undoubtedly improved since @entity103 replaced @entity145 but they still suffer from some travel sickness			2
it took them a good 20 minutes to get going , the lightweight @entity150 particularly liable to give the ball away			0
@entity58 showed some intent with a head - down charge towards the box but his effort flew high and wide			0
the brawny @entity59 showed good strength inside the danger zone but @entity31 bravely slid in to snuff out his shot			2
two minutes before the break and @entity3 doubled their lead with the best move of the first - half			1
@entity24 's fine pass out to the left found @entity33 and his centre was touched on by @entity37 to @entity36			1
@entity49 came out and forced him wide but @entity36 retained the ball , turned and found @entity24 , who 'd ghosted into the box to fire into the bottom corner			1
then , their heads giddy with the prospect of going top , @entity3 switched off and were punished			2
a long ball from the back was n't dealt with by @entity32 , who slipped and allowed @entity174 to sprint clear			0
his cut - back was perfect for @entity59 , who finished from all of six yards out			1
@entity3 manager @entity17 shouts his instructions during the high - scoring championship game @entity23 manager @entity103 looks on during the @entity12 game at @entity3 seconds later and it was @entity23 's turn to switch off as @entity24 teed up @entity36 to unleash a superb dipping shot that looped over @entity49 and into the net , his sixth goal of the campaign			1
@entity103 reshuffled a little at the break , replacing the ineffective @entity150 with @entity55 and the rewards were also instant as @entity23 again cut the deficit			2
@entity57 delivered the ball in from the left and @entity51 soared above the @entity3 defence to direct a thumping header past @entity29 into the bottom corner			1
then a moment of controversy as @entity3 claimed @entity49 handled outside the box after rushing out to stop @entity39 reaching a cross			1
referee @entity71 - and his assistant when consulted - sided with the goalkeeper			0
the game was suddenly on a knife - edge and @entity20 , who always carried a threat for @entity3 , flashed a 20 - yard hit wide just before the hour following another neat passing move			2
@entity23 's @entity49 fails to stop a shot from @entity3 's @entity36 during the @entity12 match @entity3 's @entity36 ( right ) is congratulated by @entity37 ( left ) after scoring one of five for his team then , a moment of magic from @entity38 restored the two - goal cushion			1
@entity36 was fouled by @entity50 just outside the box and the @entity213 , who had replaced @entity37 , curled a beautiful free - kick into the top corner			2
surely the contest was all over this time ? @entity218 came @entity23 once more and once again it was @entity51 leaping above the @entity3 defence to sneak a header in at the back post , again from a @entity57 cross			1
the home side came again and @entity20 had a goal ruled out for offside after @entity24 's shot had been pushed out to him by @entity49			1
still @entity23 would n't give up and substitute @entity65 attempted an audacious flick that went over @entity29 's goal			1
then , with two minutes left , the knockout blow			0
@entity20 slipped the ball through to @entity39 and the in - form striker kept running past defenders and then the goalkeeper until nobody stood in his way , rolling the ball into an unguarded net			1
' we 're top of the league , ' sang the jubilant home crowd			0
now for the week 's main attraction			0
@entity3 's @entity38 scores a free - kick during the intense @entity12 match @entity3 emerged 5 - 3 winners against @entity23 at the @entity245			1

@entity247 put @entity3 1 - 0 up after just one minute
@entity24 doubled the home side 's lead in the 43rd minute before @entity23 striker @entity59 pulled one back before the break
it was made 3 - 1 by @entity36 soon after but then 3 - 2 via @entity51
@entity3 substitute @entity38 made it 4 - 2 in the second half
@entity51 got his second and @entity39 made it 5 - 3 in 89th minute
