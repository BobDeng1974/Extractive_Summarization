this is the moment when a not - so - little baby elephant seal emerged from the sea to give a surprised tourist one big cuddle			1
@entity5 , 35 , was visiting @entity6 in the @entity7 as part of an expedition when she made an unusual friend on the beach			1
despite being no more than two months old , the elephant seal pup is still thought to have weighed around 200lbs , and ms @entity5 had a struggle sitting upright			1
we shared a very sweet moment in time i will never forget			2
' her mouth was all pink inside and her eyes were amazing to look into			2
like the deepest depths of the sea			2
i could have stared into her eyes forever			0
' she added : ' it was made very clear to me that i was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her			0
' she came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up			1
i wanted to hug her so badly			1
' physically she felt like a big dough ball , super warm and like she had no bones			0
she did not smell of fish or have bad breath			0
she had never even eaten a fish at that point in her life			0
rules : ms @entity5 explains that she badly wanted to hug the baby seal , but that regulations on the @entity7 expedition dictated that she in no way touch the pup ' @entity63 moment in time ' : ms @entity5 described the seal pup 's eyes as being ' like the deepest depths of the sea ' crushing : ms @entity5 struggles to sit upright under the weight of the 200lbs baby elephant seal two young elephant selas have a rest on the shore of @entity6 , @entity7 @entity5 , whose 2011 encounter with the seal was filmed by a friend , had at first wondered why the seal was so friendly but later learned about the harsh weaning process			1
she said : ' basically the mother fattens them up with her milk for a month or so , then abandons them on the beach			1
' they have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea			0
' this is why they can be so sweet and looking for love , i guess			0
' however , an encounter with a full - grown elephant would have been a different prospect			2
males of the species can weigh up to two tonnes and are known to have a nasty temper during mating season as the battle to control harems of females .			0
