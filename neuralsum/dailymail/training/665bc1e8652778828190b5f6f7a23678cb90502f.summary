by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 01:31 est , 30 july 2013 for years , dieters have berated themselves for every bite of bread that has passed their lips			0
but tucking into carbs could actually help us with our healthy eating plan thanks to a new loaf which claims to be ' revolutionary '			2
@entity9 , which has just launched in the @entity10 , contains seven times as much protein as normal bread and the carb count is 3g lower per slice			1
a dieter 's dream ? @entity9 , which is made in @entity10 from wholemeal flour , took almost three years to develop @entity9 , which has just been launched in the @entity10 and is made in @entity10 from wholemeal flour , took almost three years to develop with the formula going through more than 80 recipes before its manufacturers , dr @entity18 's , deemed it good enough			1
it is much denser than normal bread too			1
one loaf weighs 850 grams - about three times heavier than sliced white bread - yet its makers claim it tastes exactly like regular bread but without the excess carbs			1
it includes more than 15 grams of wheat and pea protein in every slice - regular breads contain only around two grams of protein - which aims to make consumers feel fuller without feeling bloated			2
the bread is high in @entity39 too , so eating it claims to keeps you fuller for longer than conventional high fat bread			2
and while there 's no doubt it does the trick ( see the review below ) , this is not a diet food for those avoiding carbs completely			2
a piece of @entity53 wholemeal bread contains 16g of carbohydrates , for example , whereas a piece of @entity9 contains 13.9g			2
so while the balance of protein is in the favour of the fitness enthusiast , @entity57 is not intended as part of a carb - free plan			0
the company who make the bread hope that it will be a hit with fitness fanatics because it allows them to enjoy toast and sandwiches while still maintaining a high protein diet – ideal for muscle gain			1
no excess carbs : a loaf of the bread weighs 850 grams - about three times heavier than white bread - yet makers claim it tastes exactly like regular bread without the excess carbs the bread ( pictured ) , which is made in @entity10 from wholemeal flour , took almost three years to develop with the formula going through more than 80 recipes to perfect a spokesman for @entity86 , who created the bread , said : ' everyone knows that a high protein , low carbohydrate diet is ideal for losing weight and building muscle and thousands of athletes and keep fit enthusiasts try to maintain this type of diet			1
' but avoiding carbs is n’t easy , particularly bread			0
so we saw a gap in the market for a new kind of bread , one with a much lower carbohydrate content than normal bread and a much higher protein content			1
' the best bit is it actually tastes like gorgeous bread , not cardboard but proper , freshly made bread			0
the brand knew that avoiding bread was hard so saw a gap in the market for a new kind of bread , one with a much lower carbohydrate content than normal bread and a much higher protein content ' it is more expensive than high fat bread but you would n't compare the cost of a chocolate bar to a protein bar , so you should n't compare the cost of @entity9 with high carb , high fat , low protein traditional bread			1
' in fact , our @entity9 is better value than @entity133 on a per gram of protein basis			0
' at the current offer price , just 18.6p per 10 gram of protein compared to £ 1.00 per 10 gram for @entity137 and 71p for pre-mixed @entity133			2
' we have already been amazed by the demand for the product and we really think it could lead to a revolution in weight control			0
' @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 ) at @entity147 , said : ' the protein bread does contain a much higher protein content than normal bread			1
' this offers some advantages such as slowing down digestion time compared to wheat bread alone , as well as providing an additional source of protein			0
' however it is important to remember bread is not an unhealthy food and the £ 5 per loaf price tag means there are many cheaper ways to obtain a quality protein source			1
' celebrity nutritionist @entity164 added : ' protein slows down the release of carbs effectively making this bread a source of " slow - releasing carbohydrates "			2
' the net effect should be feeling fuller for longer			0
' the ideal sandwich combines protein with carbohydrate , plus lots of vegetables			0
' using this bread , being higher in protein , together with another source of protein , such as lean meat , fish , eggs or beans ( e.g. hummus ) plus lots of greens such as lettuce , watercress or spinach , would be an ideal lunch in terms of giving you sustained energy			0
' healthy option : a loaf of the bread weighs 850 grams - about three times heavier than white bread - yet makers claim it tastes exactly like regular bread we immediately noted that the bread felt much heavier than a regular sliced loaf			1
the packaging of bread was not exactly appealing - it focused on conveying nutritional information , which is no bad thing , but the way the blueish green tinge crept down the sides of the bag was a tad reminiscent of mould - never a good look when it comes to bread			0
the bread itself tasted and felt dense and was firmer than a slice of normal bread , but also a touch more moist			1
it had a pleasant aroma to it - slightly sweet and nutty			0
it had more depth of flavour than a regular sliced loaf , and seeds gave it a pleasant texture			0
it left us feeling full and satisfied after just one slice			0
we later tried it toasted and found the texture and flavour to be very good			0
the bread kept its form and texture once toasted , even with oil drizzled over it			0
and it went very well with cheese , though maybe that is defeating the point ! the protein level is ideal for people on a high protein body - building diet - though with two slices adding up to almost 250 calories , this is not a low - cal option for those looking to lose weight ( maybe we should have stuck to one slice ? )			1
there 's wheat flour in there as well as the pea protein and wheat protein - so you wo n't be cutting back on carbs entirely			2
but it is definitely a better option than regular sliced			0
overall , it 's a better buy for those who adore bread but need to keep protein levels high ( a regular slice has 2 - 4g of protein ; this has 15g ) , or the casual healthy eater who loves bread but is keen to go for a product with a slightly lower carb count			1
unfortunately though , the £ 5 price tag is a big deterrent			1
a @entity279 - based @entity278 banker - turned - baker launched @entity280 - a unique sandwich delivery business that provides a virtually carb - free , low calorie super-bread ... made from broccoli ugg foods have created @entity285 - a mix kit that allows you to make pizza bases , pastry , gluten free bread crumbs , dumplings and of course sandwiches @entity294 is a new low - carb bread , which launched in @entity297 stores yesterday , made with protein flours rather than regular wheat based flour , it contains 50 per cent less carbs than a regular white or brown loaf			1
