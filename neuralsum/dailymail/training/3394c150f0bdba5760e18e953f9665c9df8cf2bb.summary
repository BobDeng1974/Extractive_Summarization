@entity0 , a former @entity1 player as well , was in charge of the @entity13 between 1981 and 1997 and built a team including @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 that famously beat @entity19 1 - 0 at @entity11 under @entity20 in 1988			1
in a programme piece written for saturday 's @entity23 match between @entity1 and @entity24 , @entity0 makes the surprising confession that a lot of the @entity5 stunts he instigated in the early days , like building team morale by attending army boot camps , were inspired by the unusual source @entity0 revealed a lot of team bonding exercises at @entity1 were inspired by @entity2 songs the @entity5 famously beat @entity19 1 - 0 in the 1988 fa cup final at @entity11 @entity1 supporters pictured supporting their team at the @entity23 play - off final ' our game plan was built on the words i once heard from country singer @entity2 , ' he said			1
' she was talking about appearing in films with the likes of @entity45 and admitted to being starstruck , and that the only way should could truly compete was to learn the lines of all the other actors , knowing she could fill in at any time			2
' that struck a chord with me			2
it was one of the reasons we spent pre-season training at various army training camps around @entity58 and @entity59			2
they were tough ' beasting ' days , but i wanted to build characters , make players feel at ease in different surroundings			2
' i also wanted bonding			2
i wanted mates who would rush to the rescue of mates if they ever felt they were in trouble			2
it was @entity71 thinking again – never leave a mate behind			0
' some players saw it as a hell - hole			2
@entity76 hated heights , but by the end he was abseiling down mountains like a veteran			0
@entity81 hated tunnels , but in the end he was being called an underground rat			0
' we sat down afterwards with army specialists and analysed the players , making sure they were not square pegs in round holes			2
we wanted them to feel comfortable in uncomfortable positions , so they could take this onto the field and be happy wherever and whenever they played			0
@entity0 said songs and quotes from singer @entity2 gave him ideas on how to improve @entity1 @entity0 had a contribution in appointing @entity101 as the current manager of @entity1 we also wanted character - building			1
i like to think we were ahead of our time			0
i also had every player going to @entity107 to achieve their @entity10 preliminary coaching badge to get a wider picture of the game			1
we had fun at those army training camps – and also scares			0
one night , @entity113 ( @entity114 ) , @entity115 , @entity116 ( @entity117 ) and i were dropped off by the army in a remote part of the @entity120 with just a map and compass to get home			0
' we soon got lost and decided to cut across a field			0
we were halfway across when a farmer raced out and started shouting and waving his arms and telling us to get off his land			0
when we ignored him , he raced back home , got his shotgun and started firing over our heads ! we ran for our lives			0
now that was real character - building ! ' @entity0 is still involved in @entity1 who were formed after the original club moved to @entity136			1
he helped to appoint former player @entity101 as the club 's current manager			2
@entity101 will lead his side into an @entity10 third round tie against @entity19 on january 5 in a rematch of the ' 88 final			1
@entity0 , who won a record seven automatic promotions in his managerial career , also use his article in the programme to explain his criticisms of a @entity149 documentary called the @entity5 which will air on @entity150			1
in the original cut , @entity0 and chairman @entity151 felt the programme concentrated too much on a reputation of violence and intimidation that surrounded the club and not enough of the fun			1
@entity16 ( left ) of @entity1 kisses the @entity10 as it is held by team - mate @entity159 ( right ) @entity16 describes in detail an attack @entity17 launched on a team - mate though @entity149 have now edited parts of the original version			1
@entity0 explained his connection with the club			1
' forty years ago i had a dream			0
i hope part of it still lives on in @entity1 today , ' he said			1
' our plan was to produce a group of young , mostly home - grown players who bought into my ideas			1
i am proud to say that when i left @entity1 , the club was sixth in the table and in the quarter - finals of the @entity10			1
in the side were 13 of the 21 players who began the journey with me			0
@entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity117 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity81 , @entity192 and @entity15 : all take a bow			0
@entity16 ( left ) celebrates a @entity1 goal that was scored by team - mate @entity17 ( right ) ' there certainly was n't the thuggery or bullying that has been depicted			1
i would never have tolerated that			0
i have also read that we flooded the opposition dressing room , ripped out toilet seats and blocked drains to make the place stink			0
' critics accused us sometimes of being tough , but they also forget that @entity206 had @entity207 in their side , and there were @entity210 and @entity211 at @entity19			1
@entity212 had a few that could knock you over , and so did @entity215			0
you had to stand up for yourselves			0
' prime minister @entity217 once said , ' if we can sell @entity219 to @entity220 and if @entity1 can make it to the @entity8 , then surely no achievement is beyond our reach			1
' i 'll settle for that legacy			0
