by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:26 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 08:49 est , 18 january 2013 thousands of historic pre-war posters were seized on the orders of @entity5 ’s propaganda minister @entity4 in the summer of 1938 ; months later during the @entity9 program against @entity10 , the poster ’s owner , @entity6 , was arrested and thrown into @entity11			1
though @entity6 and his wife managed to secure @entity14 visas and eventually escape to the @entity15 , @entity6 never saw his beloved posters again , even after discovering that many of them existed behind what was then the @entity20 in communist @entity21			2
now , after a seven - year battle with the @entity25 museum that held them after the fall of the @entity28 , @entity6 ’ son , @entity29 , has 4,300 of his father ’s prized posters in his possession			1
after searching in vain for a museum to house the priceless artifacts , the 75 - year - old heir to his father 's posters is selling them at auction , where they are expected to fetch $ 6million to $ 21million			2
rare : a woman looks at some of the collection of more than 4,300 @entity47 posters , looted by the @entity48 during the @entity47 impressive : @entity6 ' collection of thousands of rare posters is previewed on thursday at the @entity51 in @entity52 unparalleled : the thousands of rare posters collected by @entity6 include iconic @entity55 pieces the 75 - year - old , who lives in @entity57 , is now auctioning off many of his father ’s impressive collection of posters , which include one designed by @entity62 and another by @entity63			1
@entity4 wanted the entire collection for a museum ; it was well - known that @entity6 had the most complete collection of posters , which he had started collecting in high school			1
mr @entity6 had an eventual total of 12,500 posters , many displayed in a specially built gallery in his home			2
after the war , @entity6 assumed the collection had been destroyed and accepted compensation of about 225,000 @entity25 marks ( then worth about $ 50,000 ) from @entity78 in 1961			1
five years later , he learned that part of the collection had survived the war and had been turned over to an @entity21 museum			2
it is not known what happened to the other posters			0
@entity6 wrote the communist authorities about seeing the posters or even bringing an exhibit to the @entity78 to no avail			1
he died in 1974 without ever seeing them again			0
the posters became part of the @entity93 's collection in 1990 , after the 1989 fall of the @entity28			2
@entity94 only learned of the existence of the collection in 2005 , and began fighting then for their return			2
classic : @entity62 's 1922 poster is one of thousands of @entity6 ' collection of rare posters on preview ; they were seized by the @entity105 in 1938 from a @entity10 man on the orders of @entity5 's propaganda minister proud : @entity94 holds up a book with some of his father , @entity6 ' favorite posters at his home in @entity113 , @entity114 in 2005 legal battles went all the way to @entity78 's top federal appeals court , which ruled last march in favor of @entity119 , saying that if the museum kept the posters it would be akin to perpetuating the crimes of the @entity105			1
since being returned the posters @entity119 has repaid the 1961 restitution payment , and said he was relieved that the ordeal was now over			0
' i do n't really feel a sense of victory as much as i do of vindication , ' he said			0
' i think it 's absurd that this should have occurred in the first place ; i think the museum simply should have relinquished them in the beginning on moral grounds			2
' after the seven - year battle for their return from a @entity25 museum , @entity94 told @entity0 he hopes auctioning off the majority of the posters will mean they will finally be on display for those who love them like his father did , after he failed to find a museum willing to take the whole collection on			1
' there 's of course no practical way that i could frame and hang 4,300 posters , so i just did n't see any other alternative than to do what we 're doing , ' @entity94 , 75 , said by telephone from his home in @entity57			2
haul : the collection will be auctioned on friday , and is estimated to fetch millions of dollars @entity163 : after the war , @entity6 assumed the collection had been destroyed and accepted compensation of about 225,000 @entity25 marks ( then worth about $ 50,000 ) from @entity78 in 1961 ' but i do n't feel guilty in any way whatsoever - even with them being auctioned i think it 's far preferable that they will wind up in the hands of people who truly enjoy them and appreciate them rather than sitting in a museum 's storage for another 70 years without seeing the light of day			1

but i do n't feel guilty in any way ... i think it 's far preferable that they will wind up in the hands of people who truly enjoy them and appreciate them rather than sitting in a museum 's storage for another 70 years without seeing the light of day			0
' the auction at @entity192 's in @entity52 runs friday through sunday and features 1,233 of the posters , including one designed by @entity62 to advertise an exhibit of his own works in @entity196 in 1922 , an 1898 poster by @entity198 symbolist painter @entity63 , and even @entity201 's 1917 famous ' @entity200 ' recruiting poster ' @entity200			2

there is no reserve price set for the auction , but the individual posters being sold range in estimated value from about $ 500 to $ 40,000 , said @entity218 , president of @entity192 's			0
they date back to 1885 , and many are the only known surviving copies , and are in excellent condition , @entity218 said			0
' posters were created to be ephemeral , to be temporary things , to last an average of six weeks because they were designed to be posted up on a wall , whether it was to announce a show at a cabaret club or a political event , ' said @entity218			0
' that we 're even talking about things that are so fragile is miraculous , and despite the incredible journey these posters have been through ... in some cases they look as vibrant as the day they were printed ; the colors are so vivid			0
' @entity200 : @entity201 's ' @entity200 ' is one of thousands of @entity6 ' collection of rare posters two further auctions are envisioned for september and likely next january , but @entity6 said he also plans to hold onto about 800 posters that he will donate to a museum or museums that show an interest in putting them on display for the public			1
right now the focus is @entity10 museums , specifically with holocaust related exhibits , though other establishments would also be considered , said @entity253 , the @entity254 - based attorney who represented @entity119 in his fight for the return of the posters from @entity21 's @entity93			0
@entity253 said talks are also under way for a possible special exhibition of some of the posters at the @entity11 concentration camp memorial - the former @entity265 camp on the outskirts of @entity21 where @entity6 ' father was briefly held before he fled @entity78 for the @entity15			1
' the net result will be that a substantially larger number of the posters from this collection will be on public view than would have been had they remained in the @entity93 , ' @entity253 said			0
@entity119 is also going to hold onto four of the posters for himself - including an advertisement for @entity278 cigarettes by artist @entity279			0
he said it has special significance to him because @entity279 co-founded the art publication @entity283 , or the poster , with his father in 1910 and was a family friend			0
master : by 1905 , @entity6 was @entity78 's leading private poster collector and had a total of 12,500 displayed in a gallery in his home ' as a child i knew @entity279			1
