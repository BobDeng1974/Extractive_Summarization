the bodies were found yesterday morning in their £ 350,000 rented apartment in the resort of @entity11			1
@entity13 police said there were no signs of a struggle at the building and they were working on the theory that the father shot his wife and daughter before killing himself			1
last night the dead man was named locally as @entity23 , his wife as @entity25 , believed to be originally from @entity26 , and their daughter @entity27			1
‘ the latest information we have is that the owner of the house had not heard from the family for a few days and had not been paid , ’ said a @entity52 spokesman			1
‘ he went to the house today and when there was no reply at the door , he went inside			0
‘ inside he saw the man dead on the sofa and immediately called the @entity52			1
when officers inspected the house they found the wife and the daughter dead in a bedroom			1
‘ the initial hypothesis at this early stage is that this was a murder - suicide			2
’ the spokesman would not confirm reports that the daughter , who was in her 20s , had @entity78 ’s syndrome			1
he said : ‘ the main line of investigation points to a double murder by the father followed by his suicide			0
but the investigation is still in its early stages			0
’ scene : a shopping basket can be seen outside the front door to the property			0
there was not believed to be any sign of a struggle inside investigation : the @entity94 has said it is ' urgently ' looking into the deaths			2
drying racks for washing can be seen outside the building resort : this map shows the location of @entity11 within @entity13 the family had lived in the @entity105 complex in @entity11 , which is midway between @entity106 and @entity107 , for about seven years			1
the apartment building is in a quiet , tree - lined street in the village , which is popular with @entity3 expatriates and tourists			1
the bodies were removed yesterday afternoon and a police cordon set up			0
a friend of the family said : ‘ he had a lot of problems on his back			2
his daughter was grown - up but her mind was that of a baby ’s and his wife had been ill for some time			1
‘ he did work in a bank but told me he had changed his job			0
’ @entity129 said debt collectors had visited the family in recent days			1
several said they had heard shots , sparking speculation the bodies may have lain undiscovered for some time			0
@entity137 neighbour @entity136 , 66 , said : ‘ the couple have been in my house for a drink			2
' they were both @entity3 but i do n’t know where from			0
he must have been in his late fifties			0
he used to work in a @entity13 bank before becoming an estate agent and then losing his job			0
i think they had run out of money			0
probe : detectives investigating the triple deaths are pictured inside the property tragic : a police officer places tape around the outside of the building horrific : emergency workers can be seen at the scene ‘ he used to drive a @entity160 and his wife had a nice car of her own but then they sold them for a hired @entity165 they used to drive			1
in recent weeks i had n’t seen them driving anything			0
‘ a couple of weeks ago i saw him walking up the hill to his house with heavy bags of shopping			2
‘ his wife had fallen ill in recent months and he often came round asking if i could do anything about another neighbour ’s barking dog which was upsetting her			2
the talk round here is he killed his wife and daughter and then turned the gun on himself			1
’ garage owner @entity183 , 65 , an immediate neighbour , said : ‘ they lived like hermits			0
they always kept the metal shutters on their windows down			0
’ tragic : three members of the same @entity3 family are reported to have been found dead on the @entity6 resort of @entity11 , pictured pleasant : @entity11 is known for being civilised and family friendly expat @entity193 , 58 , added : ‘ i heard three shots the other day			1
i put it down at the time to someone shooting wild boar			0
i even joked , “ i hope someone ’s not being shot ”			2
’ @entity11 is a typical @entity201 , white - washed village with cobbled streets set in the mountains overlooking the sea			1
@entity205 , who runs the @entity206 there , said the deaths would come as a shock to the close - knit @entity3 community			2
