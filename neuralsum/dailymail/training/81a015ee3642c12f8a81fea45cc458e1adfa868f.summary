by @entity0 published : 11:55 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 12:57 est , 6 august 2013 a mummified head said to be that of a @entity4 chief will return to its origins after more than 170 years in the @entity7			1
the preserved head , known as a @entity10 moko , was brought to @entity7 in the 1840s and has been kept in @entity12 , in @entity13 , since 1843			1
but after several lifetimes in the northern hemisphere , the head of the ' @entity16 island chief ' is to be sent back in response to a call for the repatriation of such rare items , due to their ' great cultural importance '			1
@entity25 , the museum 's manager , said : ' we do n't know the precise origin of the head			0
we do know that the @entity4 used to preserve severed heads for two reasons - either to venerate a loved one , or to ridicule an enemy defeated in battle			2
not showing his age : the @entity37 was brought to @entity7 in the 1840s and kept at @entity12			2
the @entity4 considered the head to be the most sacred part of the body and it is regarded as an insult even to show a photograph of one ' but we also know that some @entity4 , when they learned that @entity46 would pay gold for the old artifacts , began to manufacture more heads for sale			1
' but in any case , @entity51 , one of the national museums of @entity54 has been asking for all such artifacts to be repatriated , at their expense , and @entity58 , which currently legally owns the head , has decided to return it			1
' the position of a @entity4 tribesmen within the tribe was identified by the tattoos on their faces , known as moko			1
the more painted the face , the higher up they were within the tribe			0
each additional motif , or moko , represented a rite of passage or a significant event in their lives			0
senior chiefs within a tribe had completely tattooed faces , while lower ranking members had only their chins and lips painted , for example			0
women were rarely tattooed , but all men who 's faces were stamped with their own special design had their heads preserved out of respect ; the preserved heads were known as mokomakai			2
this tradition reigned until about the mid 19th century when it began to disappear having been corrupt by @entity46 influences			2
@entity46 settlers brought with them firearms - a revolutionary way of fighting as far as the @entity4 were concerned and something they wanted to get their hands on			2
and one thing the @entity46 were keen to take home were mokomakai			0
and so a trade was established			0
the @entity4 would sell their mokomakai in exchange for @entity104 to fight their neighbours			0
they would steal their neighbours heads to get more guns and even started tattooing slaves with ' fake ' symbols and beheading them to sell to the foreigners			0
the problem became so bad that in 1831 the governor of @entity113 banned the further trade of heads , although some trade continued			0
@entity4 warriors , pictured at a tribal gathering in @entity54 ( stock image ) , tattooed their faces until the mid 19th century to show status ms @entity25 said many @entity122 were of @entity4 origin , adding : ' in @entity4 culture the head is considered to be the most sacred part of the body and male warriors would have an intricate facial tattoo called a moko applied to give it additional sacred powers			1
' after their death their head was smoked and dried in the sun to preserve it and ensure it was still possible to see their unique moko which allowed them to be identified , almost like a finger print			0
' because these @entity10 moko are so sacred to the @entity4 it is regarded as an insult even to show a photograph of one and the museum removed the head from public view many years ago			1
' the council 's executive board member for leisure , community and culture , cllr @entity151 , said : ' we 're proud to have had this @entity10 moko in @entity12 for all this time , and there 's a lot that can be learned from artifacts like this			1
' but we think it 's right and proper that the head should be returned to @entity54			2
' human remains like this are of great cultural importance to the @entity4 , and we 're very happy to see to it that the @entity10 moko is returned to where it came from a century and a half ago			1
' the @entity168 still perform the haka dance before their matches ( stock picture - watched by @entity173 players in @entity174 june 11 )			0
the rugby players have been offered a last chance to see the preserved head in the @entity7 as part of their @entity180 tour @entity51 has indicated that it will want to conduct a ceremony at @entity12 to thank it for its care of the @entity144 before the @entity54 authorities resume custody of it			1
the artifact is unlikely to be repatriated until the autumn so @entity58 intends to invite members of the @entity54 and @entity122 national rugby league team to pay their respects to the @entity190 during their stay in the @entity7 as part of the @entity180 .			0
