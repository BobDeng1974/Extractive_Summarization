by @entity0 and @entity1 two @entity3 servicemen have been withdrawn from the frontline while military chiefs investigate apparently damning photographs showing airmen posing beside the bloodstained body of a @entity10 fighter			1
in one graphic picture a grinning serviceman crouches beside the body lying in the sand and dirt while giving the thumbs up - trails of blood apparently from the man 's wounds beside him			1
other disturbing photographs show the bodies of other @entity10 fighters and there were concerns last night that the images could be used for recruitment and propaganda by the @entity10 in the months leading up to the withdrawal of @entity3 forces from @entity30 later this year			1
shocking : the images , uploaded to the @entity33 website , purportedly show a member of the @entity35 posing over a dead @entity10 fighter ' serious breach ' : it is against @entity35 rules to treat the bodies of enemies with disrespect			1
it is not clear whether the soldier pictured is the same as in the previous frame last night an @entity30 veteran described them as ' grotesque ' and said the apparent ' stupidity ' of the servicemen had handed the @entity10 ' a tool to beat us with			1
' ' this may have been taken as a " souvenir " but it is contrary to all instructions , it will go round the world on the internet and twisted so it comes back to haunt the reputation of the military after all the good we have done in @entity30			1
' the photographs were taken in the aftermath of a daring @entity10 attack on the main @entity3 base at @entity67 in september 2012 while prince @entity68 was deployed in @entity30 to fly @entity70 attack helicopters			1
a group of 15 @entity10 fighters wearing stolen @entity74 military uniforms crept towards @entity67 which was ringed by a 30ft wire fence			1
they cut through the wire and destroyed planes , vehicles and equipment			0
a three - hour gun battle raged involving 50 @entity3 troops , some of whom won medals for bravery			0
two @entity87 were killed and 16 troops - eight @entity74 and eight @entity3 - injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield , setting off explosions which destroyed six harrier jump jets and three vehicles			0
as well as the coalition casualties , 14 @entity10 were killed			1
the surviving gunman was captured			0
it is two of these @entity10 bodies and the subsequent actions of two members of the @entity103 - the ground fighting force of the @entity35 - tasked with guarding bases that is now at the centre of the hugely sensitive inquiry			1
the images , which also show an @entity109 burnt and destroyed in a gutted hanger , first appeared on website @entity33			1
the @entity112 said they came to its attention last month and military police were investigating			1
two of the photographs appear to show @entity3 airmen giving the thumbs up but it is unclear whether it is the same man			2
corpses : the graphic footage shows the @entity10 fighters dead on the ground			2
it is thought they were involved in a 2012 attack on @entity67 probe : military police are investigating the incident			1
two @entity35 members have been withdrawn from frontline duties defence officials said last night there is no excuse for such behaviour , which appears to break military rules			1
an @entity35 spokesman said it had a ' zero - tolerance policy on the mistreatment of deceased enemy personnel ' and this case was being treated ' extremely seriously '			2
' we can confirm that the incident is currently subject to an ongoing @entity147 investigation and therefore , it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time , ' he added			2
the photographs emerged just months after sergeant @entity149 was convicted of executing a seriously - wounded @entity10 prisoner when video footage taken on a colleague 's head camera			2
the 39 - year - old - known as @entity149 at his trial - blasted the captive in the chest at close range with his 9mm pistol in a ' moment of madness ' on the battlefield			0
controversially , he is serving a minimum of 10 years in prison after becoming the first @entity3 serviceman to be found guilty of murder in a warzone since at least the @entity167			2
@entity149 , from @entity168 , @entity169 , killed the injured insurgent following a fierce firefight on september 15 , 2011			0
the captive had been hurt by cannon fire from an @entity70 helicopter after an attack on a @entity3 base in @entity177			0
recordings from a helmet - mounted camera worn by a comrade captured the moments when @entity149 shot the prisoner and told him : ' shuffle off this mortal coil , you * * * *			0
' last month a damning report by @entity186 said blunders by @entity3 commanders were ' devastatingly exploited ' by the @entity10 to allow them to carry out the raid at @entity67			1
attack : the footage , uploaded to the @entity33 video site , also shows a destroyed @entity194 fighter jet in its hangar wreckage : the footage seems to relate to the september 2012 attack it found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years			0
the latest scandal comes amid concerns that the pull out of @entity3 troops could spark a series of legal claims for compensation by the families of @entity30 who claim to have been mistreated by @entity3 forces			2
human rights lawyers are representing more than 1,500 @entity213 who claim they are the victims of @entity3 abuse following the overthrow of @entity217			0
the vast majority of claims are being brought by two @entity3 law firms - public interest lawyers and @entity221 - who are paid huge sums of taxpayers ' money			0
@entity226 , founded by @entity228 - based lawyer @entity227 , fought a legal challenge which led to the then @entity231 government setting up the @entity232 in 2009			0
the inquiry is examining allegations that @entity3 troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others at @entity237 near @entity238 in may 2004			0
it followed a ferocious firefight with insurgents dubbed the @entity242 , named after a checkpoint			0
but after a year - long hearing costing taxpayers Â£ 23million , the case sensationally fell apart last month apr when lawyers for the @entity213 admitted there was no evidence in a central claim - that insurgents were murdered			0
it was claimed that @entity213 had conspired to claim that @entity3 troops executed and tortured prisoners to secure huge compensation pay outs .			0

images seem to show aftermath of attack on @entity67 , @entity30
a serviceman appears to smile and pose over the body of a @entity10 member
disrespecting bodies of enemies is a serious breach of @entity35 rules
@entity112 said they are aware of images and have launched a police investigation
two @entity35 servicemen have been withdrawn from frontline duties
