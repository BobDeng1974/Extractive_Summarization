@entity1 leader @entity0 has been forced to distance herself from a bizarre online site run by her boyfriend			2
@entity4 used a blog called the @entity6 maybe to defend ' rape fantasies ' , describe paedophiles as ' complex human beings ' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register			1
the couple met five years ago when ms @entity0 contacted him to correct something he had written about her , but now the @entity1 stresses they do not ' want to be associated ' with his internet rants			1
however , little is known about her private life , in contrast to the spouses of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail			2
ms @entity0 has been dating mr @entity4 for five years , after meeting online			1
he continued blogging on the @entity6 maybe site until 2011			2
he quit the @entity35 in around 2003 and later joined the @entity36			2
bizarrely , he left the party in 2012 , the year ms @entity0 replaced the more high - profile @entity38 as @entity1 leader			2
on his website , mr @entity4 appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts , often related to sex , rape or paedophiles			1
in one post , seen by @entity49 , he joked that gay sex is not a sin ' unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses '			0
in 2007 , he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn , because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims			0
mr @entity4 wrote : ' we can burn these books as a public statement against the author ( who is in jail for his crimes ) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that			1
' good , evil , interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil			0
' he also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group @entity80			0
' either i 'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than i remember … personally i did n't find it that shocking			0
' mr @entity4 quit the @entity1 in 2012 , the same year ms @entity0 became leader after replacing @entity38 ( left ) according to the @entity85 another posting included : ' new poll : sex with pupils - good idea / bad idea ? personally i 'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance			1
' it seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes			0
when you have a teacher who kissed a 17 - year - old placed on the same register as @entity99 it does make you wonder how useful the list is , no matter how creepy that teacher might be			0
' another post entitled ' even monsters have feelings ' is said to have covered the case of @entity108 schoolgirl @entity107 , who was kidnapped aged 10 by @entity109 and held in a cellar for mr @entity4 wrote : ' these are two people who had a long term and human relationship			1
' ms @entity0 and mr @entity114 reportedly share a flat she bought for £ 249,950 in 2007 in @entity116			0
last night the @entity1 distanced itself from mr @entity114 's remarks			0
a spokesman said : ' @entity119 was a personal blog written by mr @entity4 until 2011			1
' the party does not endorse the views expressed and would not want to be associated with them			0
@entity4 has not been a member of the party since 2012			1
' ms @entity0 said : ' @entity4 is a private individual not involved in party politics			1
i will not be commenting on words he 's said or written			0
