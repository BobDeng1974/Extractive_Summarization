by @entity0 a @entity2 woman has bravely spoken out after making the horrific discovery that she had been labelled a ' home - wrecker ' on a revenge porn site by her boyfriend 's ex. @entity8 admits that she started a relationship with a man she met at work when he was still married but believed he was separated and no longer living with his wife			1
the relationship did not last long after @entity14 , who has a three - year - old son , discovered her boyfriend was chasing other women			1
however the soured relationship left more than broken hearts behind - after the man 's scorned wife posted miss @entity8 's personal details along with pictures of her on shesahomewrecker.com last november , labeling the mother a ' w * * * * ' and claiming that she used drugs			1
it does n't appear that the defamatory profile of @entity14 will be taken down anytime soon - and the same goes for hundreds of women across the @entity29 who have had their nude and sexually graphic pictures posted on the site along with insults like ' fat cow ' , ' b * * * * ' , d * * * * * * * * ' and ' pitiful , home - wrecking tramp '			1
the site 's owner , a suburban mom who goes by the name of @entity41 , defiantly says that she is doing nothing wrong and that the ' scarlet women ' deserve to be publicly humiliated because they broke ' girl code ' by going after someone else 's husband			1
it ’s very hurtful ... i guess she was so scorned that she felt the need to @entity54 - stalk me , steal my pictures and say these things about me			2
' she added : ' it hurts very badly , but i ’d never blame anyone he was talking to and go after them , because that ’s on him			0
' the ex-wife of miss @entity8 's former boyfriend writes at length as to how she believes she was wronged			1
the post reads : ' she is 25 years old , with a 3 year old and is now dating my 40 year old husband			2
they are both doing drugs , and have since both lost their jobs , and i call that karma ! ' the woman who posted the profile of @entity14 has not been identified			0
miss @entity8 appears to have taken to the website to respond to the attack on her character			1
in november , she wrote : ' this is crazy b * * * * * * * ! i ’m @entity8 and this is the most disgusting thing i have ever seen you used my picture without my consent and you slandered my name because i dated your ex after he left you ! you are truly and sad excuse for a human ! ' miss @entity8 with her three - year - old son said that she was very hurt by the online profile that was put online labeling her a ' home - wrecker ' however it does n't appear that the defamatory profile will be taken down anytime soon - and the same goes for the hundreds of other women across the @entity29 being pinned by the site as ' home - wreckers '			1
the site is run by @entity41 , who operates under the fake name from her home in @entity104			1
@entity105 , 36 , who believes she is acting within the law , posts the often intimate pictures of the alleged ' homewreckers ' along with the women 's names , where they live and details about their children and occupations			1
the mother , who also runs a blog where she documents her cheating ex-husband 's affairs , said that she believes some of the alleged mistresses enjoy the attention that her site brings			1
@entity105 claims that betrayed married women from across the country have sent her more than 1,000 pictures			1
she told @entity58 that she had no intention of taking down any ' home - wrecker 's profile ' because sleeping with someone else 's husband broke ' girl code '			1
a mom , with the alias @entity41 , runs a revenge porn website where she names and shames alleged mistresses from her home in suburban @entity138 it is unclear how much money @entity105 makes from her business but the website has a number of ad placements			1
the sad tales of loyalty betrayed and marriages destroyed fill @entity105 's website in an endless scrolling list			2
one heartbroken wife from @entity151 writes : ' @entity153 day 2013 , i discovered ... all the filthy deleted texts			0
the horrible i love you ’s the descriptions of having sex in the stockroom at work			0
the talk of how they had sex , where they had sex and what they did to each other ... the affair had been going on so long i felt sick to my stomach			0
' in another a @entity171 woman sent topless pictures to the website of her daughter 's fourth - grade teacher whom her husband was allegedly having an affair			2
@entity105 's site takes a new spin on revenge porn			2

the mom runs the revenge porn site from her @entity104 home which allows women to name and shame their husband 's alleged mistresses - often including graphic pictures @entity105 's site names and shames the women accused of sleeping with other women 's husbands - with the role of the men in these alleged affairs featuring far less prominently on the blame scale			1
the alleged mistresses are tagged with long streams of insults and expletives - ' fat cow ' , ' b * * * * ' , d * * * * * * * * ' and ' pitiful , homewrecking tramp '			1

when women contacted @entity224 begging to have their picture and personal details removed , he required that they transfer $ 350 to an account linked to another one of his sites - changemyreputation.com			0
@entity105 has no remorse for her site and shrugs off responsibility over the fact that she has no proof that these women actually are the cheating mistresses they are made out to be			1
she told @entity248 : ' i ca n’t be certain for anything i read on the internet if it ’s true or not			0
' i mean , you ca n’t be certain			0
somebody ’s telling a story			0
' @entity105 also edits the photos she receives - often naked selfies of other women that scorned wives have taken off cheating husbands ' cell phones			1
she wo n't post naked pictures of women in their early twenties but of those in their thirties , forties or fifties ? ' you know better at that age ' is her response			0
the suburban mom appears to view her website as a public service for married women			2
