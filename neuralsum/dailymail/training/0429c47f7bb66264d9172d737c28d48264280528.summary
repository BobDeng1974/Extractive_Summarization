the storm , which was yesterday upgraded to a category four hurricane as its winds reached 125mph , is poised to hit @entity21 on friday and then move onto @entity100 on sunday			0

she said : ' @entity19 could hit us by monday - but it could not			2
it could swoop northwards and miss us completely - the path is still largely unknown			0
if it does hit us , it wo n't be a hurricane by the time it does and the effects of it will be no different to the usual autumnal weather we have seen lately			0
' but , if it does arrive , there could be winds of 50mph and heavy rain			2

by saturday , temperatures could reach @entity83 in parts of the south east , while central and eastern parts will also bask in glorious sunshine			0
but this will be interrupted with periods of heavy rain in western areas , @entity132 , the north west and @entity175			1
a band of rain will also linger over parts of @entity179 and the far south east coast			0
forecasters say the warm weather will continue through sunday , although the blustery and breezy winds caused by the @entity7 front means it will not feel particularly warm			2
bouts of rain will also continue to hang around the south east , while showers will be seen across western parts and the @entity189			0
but storm clouds were also seen gathering across the @entity191 later on , as @entity5 prepares itself for days of unsettled weather ferocious waves crashed into the @entity196 lighthouse in @entity197 this morning , as wintry , wet conditions hit @entity175 fierce gusts whipped up the water up into a frenzy			1
parts of @entity175 will be drenched in heavy showers over the weekend grey clouds moved overhead as the lighthouse took a battering - a sign of the unpredictable weather to come over the next few days commuters heading into @entity209 battled through the fog and mist on the @entity212 this morning a @entity214 spokesman said : ' tomorrow , a band of cloud and increasingly light and patchy rain in northern @entity175 will become confined to the @entity218			1
' many other parts of the @entity5 will have a dry morning with sunny spells , although isolated showers may affect southern and western areas			0
through the afternoon , winds will freshen as an area of rain edges in from the south - west , reaching all areas during the evening			2
' on saturday , rain may persist for a time across some southern counties of @entity134 while the rest of the @entity5 will have variable cloud and blustery showers , these potentially heavy and thundery			2
' on sunday , it looks set to remain fairly windy and unsettled with sunny spells and heavy showers , these most frequent in the north and west			0

in august this year , five flood warnings and 33 flood alerts were brought in when the remnants of @entity266 moved up from the @entity87 and swept across @entity5			0
that hurricane formed in the warm waters of the @entity87 first lashed the @entity269 , the @entity270 and the @entity271 and @entity272 with winds of up to 90mph			0
@entity274 then travelled north , veering away from the @entity260 and @entity100 coast before heading across the @entity7 and being downgraded to an ' @entity7 storm ' , which dropped 20mm of rain an hour on some parts of the @entity5			2
but hurricanes emanating from the region are not always bad news for @entity5			0
@entity283 , which ravaged parts of the @entity87 , brought warm weather to the @entity5 later in august this year by dragging an area of high pressure up from @entity288 .			0
