by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 26 june 2013 @entity1 bought some sunshine to @entity3 today as she took her seat on court one wearing a vibrant canary yellow dress			2
rain would have delayed play for her boyfriend @entity9 but the skies reflected her choice of outfit as the @entity13 took on @entity14			2
@entity1 teamed her yellow dress with a denim jacket and wedge sandals and carried her trusty @entity19 bag as she cheered and clapped her partner on to victory in his second round match			1
@entity1 was joined by @entity9 's father , @entity41 , while his mother , @entity43 , and @entity9 's best friend , @entity44 , 28 , who is currently battling cancer , were also there offering their support			2
earlier this month at @entity49 's @entity9 organised fundraising tennis tournaments in support of cancer charities in honour of his former doubles partner			0
taking her seat : artist @entity1 carried her favourite @entity19 handbag fan club : @entity1 watched the match with @entity9 's father , @entity41 , left @entity1 , an artist specialising in animal portraits , was happy to pose for photographers as she arrived on court one today			1
but on the @entity63 documentary @entity9 : @entity64 , broadcast on sunday night , she said she does n't normally court the lime light			0
she added that photographers do n't tend to stalk her and @entity9 too much over the @entity3 fortnight because the couple , who own two dogs , are ' too boring '			0
@entity9 , 26 , explained : ' the last few @entity71 they used to wait outside the house to see what we 're doing on my off days and after the fourth or fifth dog walk they realised it was a waste of time so they do n't come back anymore ! ' on to the next round : @entity9 won in straight sets against @entity82 's @entity14 in his second round match meanwhile on centre court ... @entity85 and @entity86 and @entity87 were spectators in the royal box however the couple have proved they have a great sense of humour with their @entity95 account set up in their dog @entity99 's name , who currently has more than 17,000 followers			1
while @entity9 's off court life might not impress photographers his tennis moves are continuing to wow viewers as he won the first two sets 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 while the last was closer at 7 - 5			1
as he was on court one rather the centre court today those in the royal box , including @entity87 and @entity109 and olympian @entity85 , were not able to cheer him on			0
@entity9 credited @entity112 earlier this year , as well as @entity113 and @entity114 , with giving him some extra fire power to go on and win his own olympic gold medal as he said he was inspired by their victories on @entity119 .			0
