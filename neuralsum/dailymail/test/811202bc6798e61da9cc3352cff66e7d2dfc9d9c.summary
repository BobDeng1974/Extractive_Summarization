an unemployed alcoholic who boasts of fathering 40 children plays ultra-violent @entity2 for up to 20 hours a day on a @entity4 bought with his benefits			1
@entity6 has three 48in widescreen televisions dotted around his @entity9 council house , each connected to his three £ 450 @entity4 consoles all funded by his state handouts			1
his 40 children by 20 women have cost the taxpayer more than £ 4million in benefits and care costs , with at least 16 taken off him and their mothers by social services			1
' i wo n't stop ' : father of 40 @entity6 , left and right with his fiancée @entity21 , is said to have cost taxpayers £ 4.3million in benefits and other costs because of his huge family addicted : @entity6 plays on his three £ 450 @entity4 consoles for up to 20 hours a day - all paid for by benefits but at 56 says he wants more children even though he admits he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street			1
now engaged again , the three - times married man keeps track of their names with an ever - growing family tree tattooed on his back			2
@entity36 costs : @entity6 says 16 of his children were taken into care			1
a placement in local authority care costs an average of £ 150,000 a year			1
if they each spent just a year in care , the bill would be £ 2.4million			1
child benefit : £ 1,000 per annum for the eldest child , plus £ 700 per year for each additional child , which would be claimed by the person looking after the child			2
assuming half his children are now adults and half are still entitled to child benefit , the bill would be at least £ 500,000			2
child tax credits would have been worth an average of £ 2,000 per year , per child if the parents were not working			2
his benefits : mr @entity6 claims he has received up to £ 27,000 a year in benefits , totalling £ 675,000			1
@entity62 : £ 4,375,000 his fiancee @entity63 , 46 , told @entity64 : ' he 's a good guy			2
he 's been unfaithful but that 's all in the past '			0
one of his youngest children , a three - year - old girl , was born after he agreed to help a childless couple have a baby			1
he said : ' i helped them by having sex with her			0
for all my sins i have done one or two things right '			0
one of his children , @entity77 , 25 , who is also unemployed , said : ' he was a p * * * head but he 's done well			2
i 'm proud , ' she told the @entity64 but mr @entity6 ’s brother , @entity80 , 59 , said the former fairground worker ’s ‘ shocking ’ behaviour had brought ‘ shame ’ on the family			1
@entity85 , from @entity86 , @entity87 , added : ‘ i lost touch with @entity6 when i moved to @entity87 18 years ago – he did n’t have a phone so we could n’t keep in touch			2
‘ it would n’t surprise me if he had 40 children , the way he carries on			1
i ’m not ashamed of @entity96 , but i ’m upset about the way our family name has been tarnished			0
‘ he has brought shame on us , and we are a good family			0
’ game of choice : the father of 40 loves playing @entity2 and owns more than 200 other titles worth £ 50 each his relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising , and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives			1
if they had completed just one year in care each , it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £ 2.4million			1
mr @entity6 or the children ’s mothers would also have been able to claim at least £ 500,000 in child benefit and a further £ 800,000 in child tax credits			1
on top of this , he has claimed at least £ 675,000 in benefits himself			0
yet the feckless dad , of @entity127 in @entity128 , said : ‘ i ’ll never stop [ having children ]			1
in the @entity131 , @entity130 says go forth and multiply			1
i ’m doing what @entity130 wants			2
' i ’m as fertile as sin			0
i do n’t believe in contraception and i love sex '			0
he was the subject of a @entity139 documentary this week , but last night former friends said @entity6 ’s claim to 40 children – aged between three and 37 – was nonsense			1
and as 40 kids by 20 women aired , his ex-wife @entity146 told of her embarrassment on @entity148 , writing : ‘ feeling @entity149 ’ ( sic )			0
mr @entity6 , who lives in a council house and claims benefits , said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol			2
but he still wants more children			0
‘ most of my kids have gone through the care system			0
' it makes me feel like s * * * because they ’ve suffered			0
they [ social services ] took them from me because i ’m an alcoholic			0
i ’m still an alcoholic – i just do n’t practise it			0
’ keeping track : mr @entity6 , from @entity127 in @entity9 , shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren family : @entity6 says that he loves sex and wo n't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care @entity174 ’ @entity173 chief executive @entity172 said : ‘ it is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious			1
' it is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill			0
’ but former friends say mr @entity6 ’s boasts are off the mark , and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women			1
one said he had ‘ padded ’ his numbers by including his ex-partner ’s stepchildren			0
he added : ‘ he ’s no angel after a drink but he is n’t the big ladies ’ man that he likes to think he is			0
' he ’s definitely had a football team ’s worth of little ’ uns – maybe 16 – just because he ’s not fussy and not careful			0
but no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40			0
’ offspring : @entity6 admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them mr @entity6 and his family are infamous in the former mining town of @entity127 , where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street			1
he now lives with his fiancee @entity63 , ten years his junior , in a council house in the village of @entity217			0
mr @entity6 ’s daughter @entity218 , 19 , said on @entity148 yesterday : ‘ you can all hate but it does n’t matter , there ’s plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you			2
‘ i feel like i ca n’t even leave my house without people judging			0
get off my back , i did n’t ask my dad to do what he ’s done with his life			0
’ dream : mr @entity6 says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect day out : @entity6 and @entity21 with some of the children at their local bowling alley new life : the father - of - 40 lives with his fiancée @entity63 , ten years his junior , and they live in a two - bed council house in @entity128 .			1

@entity6 , from @entity127 in @entity9 , has at least 40 children
he has three @entity246 , three widescreen tvs and more than 200 £ 50 games
16 of children taken into care ' because of my drinking and womanising '
but 56 - year - old wants more because he ' ca n't live without them '
' in the @entity131 , @entity130 says go forth and multiply . i 'm doing what @entity130 wants '
