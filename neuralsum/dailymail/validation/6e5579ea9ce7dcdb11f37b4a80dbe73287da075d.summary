after being knocked out of the @entity1 , @entity0 have just 11 games left this campaign with all eyes geared towards the @entity6 title			1
although five points clear , some chinks in @entity10 's side 's armour were bared for the world to see on wednesday			1
here , @entity13 lays out five things the @entity16 manager must do to end the season in style			0
rediscover the attacking flow anyone watching the limp defensive display against @entity22 would find it hard to remember , but for the first half of the season , @entity0 were breathtaking			1
the creative hub of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , the fearsome @entity31 in full , free - scoring behemoth mode up front , glued together with the tireless @entity34 and a rock - solid back four			0
@entity0 need to rediscover the attacking form that saw @entity28 as the league 's best creative force @entity31 nets @entity0 's third in a demolition at @entity40 that showcased the side 's attacking brilliance take the departed @entity48 ’s goal at @entity49 in the season opener , @entity30 ’s strike at @entity45 , any of the five netted at @entity40 … it seemed the @entity51 had finally meshed typical @entity10 steel with the beautiful attacking craved by @entity53			1
mar 15 - @entity54 ( @entity55 ) mar 22 - @entity56 ( a ) apr 04 - @entity57 ( @entity55 ) apr 12 - @entity58 ( a ) apr 18 - @entity59 ( @entity55 ) apr 26 - @entity60 ( a ) apr 29 - @entity61 ( a ) may 02 - @entity45 ( @entity55 ) may 16 - @entity62 ( a ) may 24 - @entity63 ( @entity55 ) in recent weeks , however , @entity10 has reverted to defensive type – to the side ’s downfall against 10 - man @entity22			1
with a host of winnable games left among the remaining @entity6 matches , putting a few teams to the sword in style would do wonders for confidence in the home straight			2
use the whole squad @entity10 has used just 22 players in the league this season – fewer than any other team			1
the boss would point to being five points clear at the division ’s summit as justification , but the stars of the side being tired out leads to displays like wednesday ’s			2
@entity89 and @entity90 must have envisaged getting more playing time when moving to @entity92 in the summer , while @entity93 would hope to have made more of an impact in his two months			0
the likes of @entity29 and @entity30 , in particular , have been noticeably poorer as the season has progressed			0
use of the whole squad is key at the top level , and something @entity10 has mastered at all his previous clubs			2
if he does n’t trust the players below the first xi , expect changes this summer			0
while he has less games left than he would have liked , @entity10 must utilise everyone at his disposal to keep the side fresh in the run - in			1
@entity90 may be wondering why he has had so little game - time since arriving at @entity92 @entity93 has found chances hard to come by since arriving in january from @entity113 give @entity114 a proper swansong @entity116 can be @entity0 ’s goalkeeper for the next decade			1
one of the most highly - rated keepers in @entity120 , his extended loan at @entity118 prepared him for a long career in @entity122			0
it would follow that we are in the final moments of @entity114 ’s sublime stewardship between the posts			2
however , the distinction between first and second choice has become far more blurred as the season has progressed			0
@entity116 has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box , leading to goals conceded @entity116 , while one of the world ’s finest shot - stoppers , has had trouble claiming crosses and showing authority in the box			1
against @entity22 , he pulled off a terrific stop only to fail to come for the resulting corner			0
he has time to develop into the role			0
for now , however , @entity10 must reinstall @entity114 as undisputed no 1			1
he has performed in every big game when called upon this season , knows what it takes to win the league , and has the experience required to guide the defence through the last 11 fixtures			0
@entity114 has impressed whenever called into the no 1 role after manning the @entity0 gloves for 10 years @entity114 ( left ) knows what it takes to win the title at @entity0 , here celebrating in 2005 with his team - mates reclaim the midfield … by giving @entity30 a rest when @entity30 left @entity163 in the summer , the @entity162 club ’s official website bemoaned his performances tailing off in the second half of the season			1
while this may have been a little facetious , his maiden campaign at @entity92 would appear to prove them correct			0
the midfielder has been poor since the turn of the year , at least			0
@entity30 , battling @entity172 , has not been firing on all cylinders since @entity174 particularly in upcoming fixtures against @entity59 , @entity176 and @entity60 , @entity10 could do with the frenetic presence of @entity178 , a repositioned @entity179 or even the young @entity180 to add more physical and defensive presence in midfield			1
@entity0 ’s midfield , with the @entity184 at the helm , completely failed to make the extra man count against @entity22			2
unless @entity30 can prove he is as useful in central midfield against a top side as he is while carving up @entity40 or @entity189 , he may lose the manager ’s faith when it comes to the crunch			0
cut out the madness every back page in the country on thursday morning showed @entity0 players surrounding the referee before being dumped out of @entity120			1
it was n’t the first time @entity51 fans woke up to see their team being discussed for the wrong reasons this season			2
@entity0 players surround the referee before @entity205 was sent off during the hot - tempered affair @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity31 have all sparked nationwide debates with on - pitch antics , while @entity10 ’s famed siege mentality has manifested itself in fairly ugly ways as the campaign has progressed			1
in these remaining 11 matches , @entity0 need to do what they do best – win , with minimum fuss			2
on form they ’re the best team in the country by some distance , so they need to remove the histrionics and resume being plastered over the papers for the right reasons			0
@entity31 has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability			0

@entity0 have reverted to defensive type in recent weeks
the @entity51 have used just 22 players this season in the @entity6
@entity114 and @entity116 have been *vying* for the no 1 shirt
@entity10 's side have come under *criticism* for their on - pitch conduct
read : @entity0 have lost leads 10 times this season . this needs fixing
