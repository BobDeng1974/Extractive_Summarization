by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 20:53 est , 26 february 2013 @entity2 wife of spy @entity2 , said @entity4 and @entity5 are conspiring to shut down his inquest @entity8 is plotting with the @entity9 to ‘ shut down ’ the inquest into the death of poisoned former @entity13 spy @entity2 in a ‘ stain on @entity4 justice ’ , it was claimed yesterday			1
the government is ‘ dancing to the @entity5 tarantella ’ by conspiring with @entity19 to hush up the assassination , a pre-inquest hearing was told			1
both countries wanted ‘ to keep a lid on the truth ’ to preserve trade deals worth millions of pounds , said a lawyer representing mr @entity2 ’s widow , @entity27			1
media organisations , including the @entity29 , are fighting the government ’s bid to withhold evidence from the inquest			0
@entity34 said : ‘ this has all the hallmarks of a situation which is shaping up to be a stain on @entity4 justice , with the @entity4 government deliberately covering up evidence			1
’ foreign secretary @entity42 , who oversees the work of @entity44 , has signed a public interest immunity ( @entity47 ) certificate to censor certain details of the case			1
coroner sir @entity50 must now decide on whether to hold part of the inquest in secret			0
mr @entity2 , said to have been a triple agent on the payroll of @entity44 and the @entity57 secret service , was poisoned with radioactive polonium - 210 while drinking tea at the @entity60 in @entity61 in 2006			1
he died in a @entity63 hospital three weeks later			0
his widow says he was assassinated on the orders of the @entity9 , and the prime suspects are former @entity13 agents @entity67 and @entity68			0
the @entity70 wants to charge @entity67 , but @entity5 refuses to extradite him			2
at yesterday ’s hearing at the @entity3 in @entity63 , mr @entity42 ’s lawyer said he had no choice but to suppress information in the case as disclosure ‘ would pose a real risk of serious harm to the public interest ’			1
the nature of the ‘ sensitive ’ evidence has not been revealed			0
but mr @entity82 said the secrecy bid risked the accusation of a cover - up ‘ orchestrated by the @entity9 ’ in cahoots with @entity87			0
mr @entity2 , an @entity88 security service officer , was poisoned by radioactive polonium in @entity63 in 2006 @entity42 has tried to exclude sensitive details relating to former @entity13 agent @entity2 's ties to @entity44 , because they could pose a ' risk of serious harm to the public ' ‘ it is absolutely crucial that the outcome of this hearing is to scotch once and for all any suggestion that it is because @entity8 is trying to promote trade with @entity5 that he is trying to close down this inquest , ’ he said			1
‘ if the material shows the @entity5 state murdered mr @entity2 , then obviously that ’s not going to be very helpful in terms of relations with @entity5			1
‘ the @entity4 government , like the @entity5 government , is conspiring to get this inquest closed down in exchange for substantial trade interests which we know mr @entity8 is pursuing			2
’ referring to the prime minister putting his arm on the shoulder of @entity5 president @entity115 during the @entity116 , he said : ‘ one has to ask what is going on			2
’ likening the situation to a folk dance , he added : ‘ we can not allow her majesty ’s government , by misusing the @entity47 system , to use this inquest to dance to the @entity5 tarantella			1
’ mr @entity82 called on the government to provide more detail on the information it wanted to withhold , to avoid the ‘ frightening prospect ’ of proceedings being ‘ suborned to the @entity5 ’			2
mr @entity2 ’s death in november 2006 plunged @entity135 - @entity5 diplomatic relations into deep freeze			1
a fugitive from the @entity115 regime , the 43 - year - old had for several years been ‘ in the employ ’ of @entity44 , with the @entity57 secret service also bankrolling his espionage activities at @entity44 ’s behest , the court heard			2
his widow believes the government failed to protect her husband			0
the inquest was due to begin on may 1 , but is likely to be delayed because of the arguments over secrecy			0
‘ the @entity4 government ’s position is untenable , ’ mr @entity82 said			0
‘ they have no right to say to an independent judiciary , “ you may not investigate these issues ”			0
that happens in @entity5 , for sure			2
’ he warned the coroner that he should not allow the process to be ‘ bogged down by the government ’s attempts to keep a lid on the truth ’			0
mrs @entity2 , who listened intently throughout proceedings , was ‘ extremely disappointed ’ by the possible setback , mr @entity82 said			0
he painted a ‘ disastrous ’ scenario in which the coroner might be shown the ‘ sensitive ’ evidence in the case , and find that although it established the guilt of the @entity5 state in the murder , he would be unable to use it in his conclusion of how mr @entity2 died because of the secrecy orders			1
@entity177 , for the media , called mr @entity42 ’s @entity47 claim ‘ extraordinarily broad ’			0
the government has ‘ neither confirmed nor denied ’ that mr @entity2 was an @entity44 spy			1
sir @entity50 is expected to announce today whether the government must shed light on the nature of the evidence it aims to conceal .			0

@entity2 was poisoned by radioactive polonium in 2006
