but newly released documents show that the soldier - turned - poet was equally sceptical about modern politicians – and twice turned down the offer of an honour from @entity5			1
@entity1 feared that his artistic independence would have been jeopardised if he had accepted either of the honours offered to him by two different @entity19 prime ministers – @entity20 and @entity21			1
his reluctance to embrace the honours system is revealed in @entity25 letters obtained by this newspaper under @entity28 laws			1
they show that other writers and artists , including @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , also turned down honours			1
@entity1 , who died in 1985 aged 90 , refused @entity20 ’s offer of an obe in 1957			1
in a letter to @entity5 on may 10 , 1957 , he wrote : ‘ i sincerely hope that the prime minister will not consider me churlish or ungrateful if i decline his proposal			0
' my reason is that i am primarily a poet , and poetry is a private activity which in my opinion should not be recognised by the award of an honorific appropriate to public servants			0
’ artists @entity33 , left , turned down a @entity50 in 1960 , and @entity34 , right , declined a @entity50 in 1977 it has emerged			1
the writer , who served as an army officer in the @entity53 , added : ‘ i am content with the three campaigning medals awarded me by @entity56 ’s @entity55 [ @entity57 ] for my services as a soldier only			0
’ @entity1 later rejected @entity21 ’s plan in may 1984 to enrol him as a @entity61			2
he was in poor health and his wife @entity63 declined the honour on his behalf			0
the writer ’s son @entity66 said last night : ‘ my father turned down the honours because he did n’t want to be beholden to anyone			2
' he thought artists should have complete independence so they could speak their minds			0
’ @entity32 ’s rejection of an obe in 1986 was abrupt			2
he wrote : ‘ i refer to your letter			0
telling me my name is being considered			0
this is to inform you that i do not wish to accept			0
’ @entity33 had turned down a @entity50 in 1960 , saying : ‘ i do not want my name now or ever to be recommended to her majesty for such an honour			1
’ @entity34 declined a @entity50 from @entity82 ’s @entity81 in 1977 , writing : ‘ i am grateful to the prime minister for his kind thought			1
although unable to accept this honour , i hope it will be understood that i have come to this decision for selfish reasons			0
