by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 11:17 est , 29 may 2012 gentlemen may prefer blondes - but it seems @entity5 men prefer buttocks , and brits prefer breasts			1
two separate studies watched the responses of male undergraduates to the female form - using eye - tracking and questionnaires , and concluded that @entity5 men tended to ogle downwards , whereas @entity17 men 's eyes went up			1
the @entity5 study , published this year , says , ' there is little empirical research that has examined individual differences in male preferences for specific traits - favouring breasts over buttocks			1
' @entity25 ( rear view ) : an eye - tracking study of @entity5 students found that the volunteers tended to prefer women with attractive buttocks @entity25 hosts @entity33 at @entity34 in @entity35 : a study found @entity5 men tended to favour buttocks it 's not just @entity5 who like a curvy posterior - @entity39 grabs @entity25 's rear end the @entity5 , led by @entity41 of the @entity42 , took a rigorously scientific approach - 184 male participants were asked to say which they preferred , breasts or buttocks			1
they were then shown an enormous number of pictures of the organs - concluding with a test where they had to judge between two women , only seeing their breasts and behinds			0
the volunteers ' eyes were tracked as they ' judged ' the women			0
we found that the first and last fixations were systematically directed towards the self - reported preferred trait , ' said the researchers			0
' we found that that @entity5 males tended to define themselves as favoring breasts or buttocks but rarely thinking that these traits contributed equally to their choice - but the distribution was biased towards buttocks , ' said the researchers			2
@entity69 is famous for her large bosom - but while @entity17 undergraduates focused on breasts , they preferred smaller ones , said the study an earlier - and very thorough study - by @entity78 academics concluded that the volunteers ( 114 @entity17 students ) preferred small breasts			2
‘ the stimuli consisted of nine nude female silhouettes , prepared … in such a manner that the size of breasts and buttocks could be varied systematically , ’ say the researchers			0
‘ the participants in this study showed a preference for small breast size , although buttocks size did not appear to alter ratings of attractiveness			2
it would be useful for future research to include a larger range of breast sizes and shapes			0

eye - tracking study proves @entity5 men prefer to *linger* on the rear
men asked to indicate preference before interview
' little research into what men prefer - breasts or buttocks '
