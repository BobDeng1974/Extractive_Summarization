@entity0 are heading to a @entity1 in @entity2 and @entity3 with all the attention on their captain and his form — and that ’s worrying			1
the issue with @entity9 i ’m afraid is the same as it was last summer			0
i said then i was concerned that the captaincy came at the expense of his best form and it is particularly relevant in one - day cricket ahead of the @entity1			1
we are talking about a world - class batsman , a player whose stats stood comparison with @entity21 ’s at the same age , but one who has now failed to score a century in 59 innings in all cricket for @entity0			1
@entity0 captain @entity9 ( centre ) watches the presentations after losing to @entity28 on tuesday @entity9 shows his frustrations as he walks back to the pavilion after his dismissal against @entity28 @entity9 ( right ) walks past a lion mascot ahead of the final one - day international in @entity34 on tuesday video @entity9 on @entity0 's loss to @entity28 if @entity9 was a @entity39 - type figure as a leader you might understand @entity0 ’s desire to keep him at the helm in @entity43 and one - day cricket , but is it worth sacrificing his batting so that he can be an ‘ ok ’ captain ? @entity9 is a fighter and wants to prove people wrong again and you have to admire that			1
the loyalty of the selectors is admirable in many ways , too , but it has led to issues , not least whether the captain is worth his place in the side			0
in the last one - day international in @entity28 , for instance , @entity9 would have had to go up to @entity59 and tell him he was leaving him out			1
but @entity59 could have been forgiven for thinking : ‘ hang on , why are you still in the side ? ’ if the @entity1 were in the sub-continent there is no way @entity9 should be captain — it is all too obvious what would happen to him in @entity28 — but as it ’s in @entity2 and @entity3 he might do reasonably well			1
it is whether it is enough in the modern world of one - day cricket for @entity0 to reach the latter stages and as it stands the selectors are simply left hoping that it will be ‘ all right on the night ’			1
it would not be too much of a gamble to replace him now			0
it should have happened months ago , of course , and more dynamic players should have been given time to bed into the side , but @entity0 do not have much to lose now			2
it is a question of whether they want to rock the boat and hurt the captain they have put such store in by admitting they were wrong and giving the captaincy to @entity92 or , at a push , @entity94			0
it ’s understandable that the focus should be on @entity9 , but that does mask a lot of problems that are just as serious as his lack of runs			0
@entity92 ’s form is key among them			0
he is such an important player , @entity0 ’s most important batsman in the one - day game , but his form has in many ways been worse than @entity9 ’s and that ’s a huge concern			1
if @entity0 are going to have any chance at this @entity1 they simply have to have @entity92 at his best because he is vital to them reaching the scores of 300 - plus that are going to be required			2
the captaincy seems to have brought something like the best out of him in recent times so maybe that would galvanise him now , but if it is not to be that , then @entity0 have to sit @entity92 down and work through what ’s wrong			0
@entity92 makes signs to his team - mates during the match against @entity28 in @entity34 @entity94 ( right ) bats as @entity0 took on @entity28 in the final match of the @entity122 series @entity28 players embrace as they celebrate their victory over @entity0 on tuesday to me , though , the bowling is an even bigger worry than the batting because @entity0 are lacking wicket - takers in this form of the game			2
they are pointing to @entity132 and @entity133 coming back — but hang on a minute			0
@entity132 has traditionally taken time to work his way back to his best after injury , while if the white ball does not swing , @entity133 may struggle for wickets			0
if @entity0 do not take wickets they will always be chasing more than 300 in this @entity1 — or will have to try to set that , and then we come back to whether the batting is dynamic enough to reach those heights			2
these problems , of course , are nothing new			0
we put test cricket first in this country and that means that predominantly test batsmen in myself , @entity150 and @entity151 have been in charge for the last three @entity155			0
perhaps the selectors wanted to stay loyal to their @entity43 leaders on those occasions , too , and we were all grateful about it at the time — but it did n’t work for us all then and you have to say the odds are against it working for @entity0 now			2
when i helped compile the @entity165 seven years ago , we were saying one - day cricket should be treated just as seriously as test cricket and i see that @entity168 was saying the same thing this week			2
well , if @entity0 really mean it this time then they have to put faith in the younger , more dynamic batsmen who have grown up with @entity174			0
@entity0 bowler @entity132 appeals during the fifth test against @entity176 at the @entity177 in august bowler @entity133 ( right ) appeals for lbw against @entity176 during the summer @entity43 series why , for instance , has it taken them so long to get @entity182 in the side when he has consistently delivered the goods at a high level of domestic one - day cricket ? @entity187 may have been ‘ found out ’ to an extent but @entity0 have to be bold and back their one - day players with the same loyalty they have shown their @entity43 players			1
that means understanding that the peaks and troughs are more extreme with younger players and understanding that they must be given a decent run in the side to show that they can adapt and grow into international cricket			0
as it is , @entity43 batsmen who play so much international cricket that they do n’t have time to work on their one - day skills are having to do just that with a @entity1 on the horizon , and that ’s all wrong			1
the fact that @entity9 is still having to work out his best way to play spin in one - day cricket is a disgrace			1
@entity0 ’s best test players , such as @entity9 and @entity212 , do not play enough white - ball cricket either domestically or around the world , and that means they are standing still while other nations are enhancing their one - day skills			1
captain cook reacts as @entity0 disappointingly go on to lose the series in @entity28 @entity9 ( left ) hits a shot as @entity28 wicketkeeper @entity220 ( centre ) and @entity223 watch another recommendation of the @entity165 was that the calendar should be changed to avoid @entity155 following @entity227 series and while that has been done this time i ca n’t think of worse preparation than a seven - match , 50 - over series in @entity28			1
all that was ever going to do was show up @entity0 ’s shortcomings and affect their confidence , which is exactly what has happened			0
it would have been far better if all @entity0 ’s players had gone off to play in the @entity239 in @entity2 — if they had been able to get contracts — because that is the type of limited - overs cricket that @entity0 must play if they are ever to make an impact			2
as it is , we are still far too ‘ @entity246 ’ in the way we play one - day cricket and it is difficult to see that being the way forward at this @entity1			1
with or without @entity9 in charge .			0

@entity0 lost the one - day international series 5 - 2 against @entity28
@entity9 has failed to score a century in 59 innings for @entity0
it 's a disgrace that @entity9 is still working out how to play spin
@entity0 worryingly head to the @entity1 with all the attention on @entity9
@entity9 should have been replaced as captain months ago
