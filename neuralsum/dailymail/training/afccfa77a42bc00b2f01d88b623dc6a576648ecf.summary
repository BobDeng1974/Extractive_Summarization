@entity1 's penalty sent @entity2 into second place in the @entity5 table after their pulsating 3 - 2 derby win over @entity7			1
substitute @entity1 fired the @entity8 to their fifth league win on the spin after @entity11 had fouled @entity12 in the box in the 75th minute			2
the @entity16 striker 's effort came after @entity17 looked to have grabbed a point for the @entity19 with his first goal since signing from @entity21			2
substitute @entity1 stepped up to slot in the winning penalty for @entity2 against @entity7 @entity26 's men , who had twice got themselves back in the game after going behind , remain just above the relegation spots after one win from 12 league matches			1
the visitors started strongest in blustery conditions with a @entity34 free - kick being deflected just past a post			0
@entity37 's cherries were making uncharacteristically sloppy passes in possession but did force the first real chance after 15 minutes			0
@entity41 jinked his way into the box and forced a low save from @entity45 , who was making his first league start of the season after signing from @entity48 on friday			0
both teams had contrasting results against @entity52 opposition in the @entity53 in midweek , with the home side knocking out @entity55 and reaching the quarter - finals for the first time in their history			0
and things got worse for the @entity19 , who were knocked out by @entity61 , when captain @entity62 headed a fizzing @entity64 cross into his own net to gift a 24th - minute opener			2
if @entity2 did not deserve their goal , @entity7 definitely did when it came three minutes later through @entity70 's first of the campaign			1
@entity72 also scored as @entity2 recorded a 3 - 2 victory in the derby against @entity7 the @entity75 picked up on a defence - splitting pass from @entity77 to round @entity78 and score only a second goal from one of the club 's strikers this season			1
but the lead did not last long as @entity72 , fresh from his hat - trick last saturday , saw his acrobatic volley fly past @entity45 via a deflection off the unlucky dunk			1
after the break @entity26 's men continued to create opportunities to force the leveller and @entity11 was inches away from heading a @entity94 free - kick past @entity78			0
@entity97 , playing against his former club , then had to make a diving interception to block @entity77 's shot after a swooping break sent him through on goal			0
when @entity17 's tidy finish from a ball forward from @entity104 made it 2 - 2 on the hour , @entity37 responded by hauling off the ineffective @entity105 and @entity41 for @entity106 and @entity1			1
and despite not showing the form which has seen them talked about as potential automatic promotion candidates , they pushed forward in search of the three points			0
@entity113 came on to try and rescue a draw but brave defending from @entity115 denied him late on			0
@entity17 equalised for the second time for @entity7 but they could not hold on and eventually lost			1

@entity2 won a pulsating south coast derby 3 - 2 on saturday
@entity122 's penalty sends @entity8 second in @entity5
@entity62 and @entity72 scored @entity2 's other goals
@entity127 and @entity17 struck for @entity7
