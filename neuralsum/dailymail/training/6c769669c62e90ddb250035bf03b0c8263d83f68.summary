rumours of @entity1 following @entity2 as safety - turned punt returner are greatly exaggerated			1
but anyone who witnessed his 81 - yard interception touchdown against the @entity7 can not fail to be impressed			1
' those days left me in high school , i guess , ' @entity1 says after his dart into the end zone put the gloss on the @entity13 ' crushing 34 - 6 win			1
@entity1 of the @entity13 returns an interception for a touchdown at the @entity17 @entity7 ' @entity18 is upended by @entity13 ' @entity1 as @entity19 , left , looks on as starts go , it was impressive			1
but the level - headed 25 - year - old is rightly refusing to get carried away			1
' it ’s a confidence - builder			1
it ’s a great place to start and we did a lot of good things but there ’s still a lot to improve on and a lot to correct so we just need to focus on getting those things done and getting better			1
' for starters getting the yards down in the passing game			1
especially being a defensive back			2
i think we gave up like 250/260 yards which is too much for us			1
but getting turnovers was big , getting sacks was big and keeping points down is the overall goal			2
' thursday : @entity40 at @entity41 sunday : @entity42 at @entity43 @entity44 at @entity45 @entity46 at @entity47 @entity48 at @entity49 @entity50 at @entity51 @entity52 at @entity53 @entity54 at @entity55 @entity56 at @entity57 @entity58 at @entity59 @entity60 at @entity61 @entity62 at @entity63 @entity64 at @entity65 @entity66 at @entity67 @entity68 at @entity69 monday : @entity70 at @entity71 @entity1 missed half of last season with turf toe - a major factor in the @entity13 conceding an average of over 30 points a game			1
and as he enters his third @entity80 season , he agrees he is one of the leaders of @entity83 's aggressive , confusing new defensive scheme			1
' i would say my approach to the game and my approach to everyday showing up is being a guy that is accountable			2
of being a guy that coaches can rely on			2
' watching other guys has helped me			2
@entity19 is a guy on the team who ’s an obvious leader on the defense , he ’s a guy i ’ve learned a ton from and continue to learn from			1
so i 'm still trying to grow with that role and get better at it			2
' @entity99 and general manager @entity100 began their overhaul of the defense in march , with the free agency additions of run - stuffing defensive tackle @entity105 from the @entity49 and cornerback captain @entity106 from the @entity57			1
' both huge additions , ' @entity1 says			1
' @entity105 , not only is he a great run - stopper - he kind of clogs up that middle - he ’s a real athletic guy			1
gets a lot of pressure on the quarterback and that showed up on sunday			2
' captain , not only can he play corner but he comes into that nickel spot			2
he ’s an aggressive player			2
@entity117 plays on the ball , tackles really well			2
so when he ’s out there he ’s going to make his presence known			2
i ’m just happy to have him on our side			0
' @entity1 's score was the third of his career from 25 games - trailing @entity106 's five from 78			1
' he ’s got a little bit of a lead on me			0
we were joking about that after the game , so i ’m trying to catch him , ' he laughs			0
@entity105 of the @entity13 celebrates after sacking @entity135 of the @entity7 @entity7 wide receiver @entity136 hooks the facemask of @entity138 cornerback captain @entity106 after joining the @entity13 from @entity139 in the 2012 draft , he knows the path from the first round ( selected 29th ) to starter well			1
he praised lockermate @entity143 , the giant linebacker who came from @entity144 as the ninth pick in may 's draft			1
' obviously @entity143 is a guy who you know , he ’s a ballplayer			1
that was obvious as soon as he stepped onto the field			0
and him being in our defense too , you really do n’t think of him as a rookie			1
@entity13 head coach @entity83 waves as he walks off the field in @entity58 ' he ’s going to get his job done , he ’s going to make plays not a lot of people can make and it ’s going to be exciting to see what he really becomes after he gets a few games under his belt because he ’s already doing things that not a lot of people can do			1
' ' he gets pressure on the quarterback , makes tackles in space , great in the coverage game and put some pretty good hits on the quarterback on sunday , so it ’s nice having him as an addition			0
' in @entity1 's first season , a @entity13 team packed with defensive stalwarts such as @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 won their final four regular season games to reach the play - offs			1
@entity1 remembers his time with the now - retired @entity181 fondly			1
' i learned how to be a pro really from him			0
just sitting in a room with him , just seeing how he shows up does his job			0
great guy on and off the field and somebody to really look up to			0
' a keen student of the game , @entity99 has spoken in glowing terms of the disruptive @entity1 's willingness to learn			1
before his injury last october , he looked set for the @entity198 , and his conscientious approach to the game is to be admired			0
' you want to improve on things that you have control over , ' he says			0
there ’s times when you can do extra			0
times when you need to watch extra film			0
times when you need to spend extra time getting your body right , working out , so i think part of learning to be a pro and to be efficient is knowing when to work on those things			0
because you ca n’t just work yourself into the ground in all areas : you ’re not going to last very long - it ’s a long season			2
so you need to know what to improve on			0
and get it done and that ’s something i ’ve tried to learn more and more every season			0
' ' there ’s guys i have a ton of respect for and like watching on film			0
[ @entity228 ] @entity227 , obviously			0
i got to watch [ @entity231 ] @entity230 last night			0
guys all over making plays			0
@entity234 was a guy who made unbelievable things happen			0
so you try and learn stuff from guys watching films every week			0
you can pick up some things that a guy will do here and there and just try and add things to your game			0
' @entity7 quarterback @entity135 throws an interception to @entity13 free safety @entity1 ' growing up i remember one of the first guys i was excited to see play the position was @entity251			1
it was toward the end of his career at @entity67			0
he was a guy , i remember watching the @entity255 against the @entity65 and he hit one of the @entity65 receivers and one of the @entity255 corners on the same play			0
he was a guy that was fun to watch when i was really young			0
' next up , the @entity13 welcome the might of the @entity263 to the @entity264			1
stinging from a 20 - 33 defeat against @entity266 , @entity1 knows facing the learned mind of @entity268 and a modern great in the shape of @entity270 will be tough			1
but that 's why he plays the game			2
' obviously , he ’s one of the best to play that position			0
i ’m excited to go against a guy of his calibre , which there are not many of			0
just even to play against them it ’s kind of what we look forward to ; playing against the best			0
we ’re going to get ready to play and we ’ll see where the chips fall after sunday			0
' and as well as being a major part of a new look team , the hard - hitting @entity1 also has a new nickname			1
christened ' @entity287 ' by ebullient play - by - play caller @entity288 , it is a moniker he is embracing			1
he asked me if it was ok to call me it			0
and i gave him the go - ahead			2
@entity294 does a great job			0
and it ’s fun to hear him get excited on the play - by - plays			2
' and if the @entity13 go to 2 - 0 on sunday , both @entity1 and @entity180 will have much to be excited about .			1

@entity1 ran 81 - yards for an interception touchdown as the @entity13 *thrashed* the @entity7 34 - 6
@entity301 , @entity302 and @entity303 also scored to get @entity83 's regime off to the *perfect* start
@entity1 credits new additions @entity105 , @entity106 and rookie @entity143 for improving the defense
and he tells why he is embracing his new nickname ' @entity311 '
