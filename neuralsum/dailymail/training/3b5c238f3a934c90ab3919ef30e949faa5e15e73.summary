by @entity0 ever felt you ca n't enjoy being happy in case you tempt fate ? if so , you 're not alone			2
millions of people actively avoid feeling happy because they think it will cause something disastrous to happen to them , research has revealed			2
@entity11 psychologists have found that we shy away from enjoying the moment because we fear it leads to unhappiness and other unfortunate consequences			2
tempting fate : millions of us fear that embracing feelings of happiness will cause something disastrous to happen later down the line others - both in @entity23 and @entity24 cultures - avoid happiness because they are convinced it makes them a worse person and others may see them as selfish , boring or shallow			1
people in non-western cultures , such as @entity33 and neighbouring countries , worry that their peers , an ' evil eye ' or some other supernatural deity may resent their happiness and they will eventually suffer any number of severe consequences , the study found			1
in @entity42 , however , it is almost taken for granted happiness is one of the most important values guiding people 's lives			1
western cultures are more driven by an urge to maximize happiness and minimise sadness			1
psychologists dr @entity52 and dr @entity54 said : ' many individuals and cultures do tend to be averse to some forms of happiness , especially when taken to the extreme , for many different reasons			1
negative : others fear that being happy makes them appear selfish , boring or shallow ' some of the beliefs about the negative consequences of happiness seem to be exaggerations , often spurred by superstition or timeless advice on how to enjoy a pleasant or prosperous life			1
the researchers , from the @entity71 , said being pleased with your lot is more likely to be the ultimate goal of @entity23 , rather than people from other cultures			1
the analysis , published in @entity79 's @entity78 , reviews why we avoid being happy and why various communities react differently to feelings of well being			2
dr @entity52 and dr @entity54 add it is ' a cultural phenomena ' that for some individuals happiness is not a supreme value			0
the researchers believe being raised in a culture that does not value happiness could encourage a person to back away from it			0
and while avoiding it exists in both @entity23 and non @entity23 cultures , it is more valued in the @entity23			0
failing to appear happy is often a cause for concern			0
its value is echoed through @entity23 positive psychology and research on subjective well being			0
but in non @entity23 cultures it is less valued			0
the ideals of harmony and conformity are often at odds with the pursuit of personal happiness and the endorsement of individualistic values			0
for instance , studies have shown @entity115 are more inclined than westerners to believe it is inappropriate to express happiness in many social situations			0
similarly , @entity120 are less inclined to savour positive emotions than @entity42 .			1

others fear that being happy makes them seem selfish , boring or shallow
in some cultures , such as @entity127 , happiness ' is not seen as a priority '
but in the @entity42 , for example , it is seen as the ultimate goal in life
