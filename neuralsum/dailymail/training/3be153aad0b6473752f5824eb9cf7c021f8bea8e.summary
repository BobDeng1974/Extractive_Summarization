as @entity0 take stock ahead of surely the defining match of this @entity3 against @entity4 , my advice would be : ‘ do n’t buy into the cliches			1
do n’t waste a second about what is meant to happen and how such a massive occasion is meant to play out			0
just have the confidence to produce your a game , execute and win			0
’ @entity13 is full of these cliches and they can get into your head			0
‘ you never know which @entity18 team are going to turn up ’ ; ‘ the @entity20 pack will always make life difficult ’ ; ‘ the @entity22 will always out - muscle you up front ’ ; ‘ @entity24 run the ball from everywhere ’ ; ‘ the @entity26 ca n’t scrummage ’ ; ‘ playing @entity4 on a wet afternoon in @entity27 is hell ’ ; ‘ you must silence the crowd in @entity30 ’ , etc. these expressions are redundant			1
before the @entity34 game i was amazed that so many pundits talked up @entity34 , at home , as strong favourites with their phalanx of great @entity39 from 2013			2
@entity40 is congratulated after scoring during @entity0 's 47 - 17 victory over @entity43 at @entity44 @entity40 escapes the clutches of @entity43 's @entity46 as @entity0 make it two wins from two at @entity3 @entity0 's win was marred by a concussion injury to @entity52 , although he should return against @entity4 @entity0 skipper @entity53 shakes hands with the bruised and battered @entity20 after the match i looked at the two teams and asked myself how many of the @entity34 players would make a @entity39 starting xv on current form and there were n’t many			1
from the off , i was convinced @entity0 , injuries or no injuries , would win			2
before the @entity43 game i got some stick and was accused of arrogance because i insisted that victory was a given and @entity0 should look to score 50 points against the @entity20 , a team i have a lot of time for and who have an important role to play in the @entity3			1
i just looked at the two line - ups on the day and assessed what should happen if @entity0 hit their straps			1
in the end @entity0 clocked up 47 after a patchy start and should probably have scored 25 more			1
the next step for @entity0 — who are beginning to excite us with their development and ambition — is for them to have total confidence in their ability and ignore all these old stereotypes			1
they are good enough now to shape the game themselves			0
rugby at this level is about spending 85 per cent of your time on what you do — put the result in your own hands and let the opposition worry about how you are going to play			0
@entity95 scored his first international try as @entity0 come from behind to beat @entity34 in their opener @entity0 players celebrate at the full - time whistle after a brilliant 21 - 16 win against @entity34 that surprised some @entity0 's @entity52 consoles @entity101 of @entity34 after victory at the @entity103 more will be written and said in the next two weeks before the game in @entity27 than for any rugby match in a long time			1
outside the @entity0 bubble , rugby fans can lap it up			2
but inside the @entity0 camp , just keep it factual and focus on your game plan			2
@entity4 are a very good side with many world - class players — notably @entity116 and @entity117 — and an extremely astute coach in @entity119 who is one of the very best and is loving this role			1
@entity4 are very fit — they demonstrated that with how they soaked up @entity18 pressure in the final quarter — they keep it simple and with @entity123 returning and @entity124 back in the groove they will be at full strength when @entity0 arrive			1
why they are at full strength and @entity0 still have players missing has been well documented in these pages			2
@entity4 demand total respect but , on current form , more @entity0 players would get in the @entity4 team than vice-versa			1
@entity0 have a better scrum and line - out and can win the battle at the breakdown			1
the @entity0 backs have been earning most of the plaudits but it ’s time for the pack to take centre stage again			2
@entity0 and @entity4 are both on an upward curve and have real momentum			1
for @entity0 this match is exactly the kind of game they will have to negotiate if they are to reach the @entity149 final			2
any win in @entity30 or @entity27 is a great victory but , if we are serious about becoming the best team in the world , they are results that @entity0 need to become comfortable with and expect of themselves			2
they need to carry the mind - set : ‘ we are @entity0 and we will win this game			2
’ this is not arrogance , this is the mind - set of champions			0
the @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 of this world			0
@entity4 defeated @entity168 18 - 11 in @entity27 to notch up a ninth consecutive victory on saturday @entity4 head coach @entity119 ( centre ) is one of the very best in international rugby @entity4 have a potential match winner in fly - half @entity116 who has returned after a 12 - week lay - off i would ease down on the training in the build - up , even though the temptation is to work the team hard			1
i would have plenty of walk - throughs but the priority must be to keep everybody sharp mentally			0
i would n’t be afraid to tweak a winning team			0
again we wait on fitness reports on @entity189 because he is always an @entity0 starter for me if fit but @entity192 must be reassured how well @entity193 and @entity194 have been doing , so it ’s not an issue			1
@entity4 will use @entity116 ’s kicking game to attack @entity0 ’s back three so @entity0 must address that in training and it will be complicated by whether @entity52 passes his concussion protocols			1
@entity0 will want their best footballing back three on the park and @entity52 , if fit , and @entity95 clearly start but there might be a debate around @entity206 , who is more of an out - and - out wing			2
that debate is fair enough but against @entity4 i would only consider bringing somebody in if they add something to the mix and have a superior defensive and kicking game to may — given how organised @entity4 ’s catch , kick and chase game is			0
i ’m not sure there is anybody who fits that description			0
finally , are @entity0 becoming slow starters ? it would be easy to get distracted and misinterpret this			0
they went 10 - 0 behind to @entity34 and conceded an early try against @entity43 but i ’m not sure a slow start per se is the problem			1
against @entity34 they took the @entity226 apart at an early scrum but @entity228 miraculously rescued the situation to create @entity34 ’ try			0
@entity0 conceded early points against both @entity34 and @entity43 , but should not be labelled slow starters @entity231 ( c ) has impressed in @entity189 ' absence , but @entity0 should n't fear making changes @entity192 congratulates @entity40 after the game ahead of a possible @entity236 decider against @entity4 against @entity43 , @entity0 did n’t get it right from the kick - off , passing the ball across the line looking for something to happen			1
no problem running the ball from the first whistle if it is on but against @entity43 it was not on and they took some time to recover			0
if in any doubt , play some phases and bang the ball straight back , put in an aggressive chase and start playing in the opposition half where you can start thinking about getting the scoreboard ticking , including drop goals very early			0
@entity0 need to be very alert tactically in those opening exchanges against @entity4 — at kick - offs and re-starts for example			1
do n’t kick the ball deep and give @entity116 an easy kick , go for the short option and contest every scrap of possession from the off			0
get that @entity0 pack into the game as soon as possible			0
above all , play in the present			0
do n’t give any thought to what has happened in the past and how @entity4 matches with @entity0 are meant to unravel			1
just play your game and the opposition			0
that is what champion teams do .			0

@entity0 followed up their opening @entity3 victory over @entity34 by defeating @entity43 47 - 17 at @entity44
@entity192 's side face a stiffer *challenge* against @entity4 on march 1
