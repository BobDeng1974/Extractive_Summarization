by @entity0 this is the part - time snake charmer who catches deadly species every day - despite being allergic to most anti-venoms			1
humble taxi driver @entity6 began catching the animals more than 30 years ago and believes he has now freed more than 40,000 from homes in @entity9 , southern @entity10			1
the serpent - lover has only been bitten four times , but when he was , doctors discovered their treatments were prompting a severe allergic reaction which could kill him			1
that means mr @entity6 's next call - out could be his last - but despite the dangers , he refuses to give up			1
' snakes are not as poisonous as human beings , ' he said			0
' i do not fear getting bitten - snakes are our friends			1
' snakes are everywhere here around @entity9			2
we are the trespassers - we take away their homes and they have nowhere to go - so i help return them peacefully to what 's left of their habitat			0
' the snake - catcher believes there around 25 species in @entity9 , including several non-venomous or near - harmless species like sand boas , tree snakes and rat snakes			2
but the city also has several highly dangerous animals			0
more than half his catches have been cobras , and he has encountered species including the saw - scaled viper - one of south @entity63 's most dangerous snakes			2
safe : mr @entity6 keeps snakes in specially - adapted jars before releasing them into the wild ' we are the trespassers , ' said the snake - catcher , who had to prevent his son doing the same job			2
' we take away their homes and they have nowhere to go , so i help return them peacefully to what 's left of their habitat ' experienced : mr @entity6 has caught snakes for 30 years and has only been bitten four times the animals often choose to live near human settlements , bury themselves in sand and are quick to bite when they feel threatened			1
mr @entity6 rounds up around 10 snakes per day from homes , schools and workplaces around the city			1
to demonstrate his fearlessness , he even kisses cobras ' heads to prove they can not harm him			0
his son also began catching snakes until he was discouraged by his father - who carries out his jobs in between ferrying children to school in his taxi			0
the snake - catcher added : ' i rarely take a day off			0
on my busiest days i can attend as many as 20 calls and travel more than 80km across the city			0
character : he is well - known in the city of @entity9 and attracts large crowds of onlookers wherever he goes records : mr @entity6 keeps a careful count of the number and species of snakes he catches ' i rarely take a day off , ' he said			1
' on my busiest days i attend as many as 20 calls and travel more than 80km ' environmentalist : the snake catcher 's cheery slogans on his taxi include ' we are all guests to nature ' ' some days i may get only one call , others ten , but never a day goes by where i do not get a call from distressed persons who need help removing a snake			0
' and he refuses to charge his clients for removing snakes from their homes , cars , water tanks and workplaces , instead receiving donations of between 10 rupees ( 10p ) and 100 ( Â£ 1 )			2
' i can not charge because then people will kill the snake rather than pay , ' he said .			0
