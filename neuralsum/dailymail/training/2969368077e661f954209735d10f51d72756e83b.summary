a @entity1 mother who is accused of kidnapping her four - year - old son for a year after @entity4 court handed custody to her ex-husband has claimed she went on the run because he threatened to kill her			1
@entity9 , 46 , from @entity10 , is facing charges of kidnapping in the @entity12 this week after taking her son when custody was awarded to her @entity16 ex-husband by a @entity4 court			1
mrs @entity9 , was a senior civil servant in east @entity10 before moving to the @entity12 in 2010			1
@entity9 , 46 , from @entity10 , is facing charges of kidnapping in the @entity12 this week after taking her son when custody was awarded to her @entity16 ex-husband by a @entity4 court she claims she has been living in poverty ' trapped ' in the country since the authorities took away her passport following a travel ban obtained by her ex-husband			1
mrs @entity9 alleges that her wealthy ex-husband has exploited @entity4 ’s legal system , based in part on @entity29 sharia law , to gain custody of the little boy and have criminal charges brought against her			1
she is now facing trial for allegedly abducting her son in march 2012 , when she failed to take him to a court - ordered access meeting in a park with her former partner , a 38 - year - old aviation engineer			1
she strongly denies the charge and told a court this week : ' i did not kidnap my son			0
but after one of our court hearings , my ex-husband threatened to kill me if i did n’t give him the boy so i got scared and stayed away from him			1
' in a letter submitted to prosecutors on february 18 last year her ex-husband wrote : ' she would forget his vaccinations , prevent the father from providing him with medical care , since he suffers eczema , and leaves the boy with strangers during her repeated travels and staying up late at parties with her friends			2
' mrs @entity9 has been told she must produce three witnesses who support her defence , that she did not turn up because she had allegedly suffered domestic abuse			2
if she is found guilty at the next hearing on february 11 , she could be imprisoned and deported			0
she told the @entity64 : ' i just want to be reunited with my son and i want to come back home			0
' i feel let down and abused by everyone and everything , and especially let down by the @entity69			0
' one of her two adult sons in @entity1 , @entity72 , 26 , is raising the profile of his mother 's case at home			0
@entity78 , @entity79 mp for @entity80 and @entity81 , told the @entity82 mrs @entity9 had moved to @entity4 , but is ' now stranded there ' he wrote on a blog : ' on one occasion @entity9 and her baby were flung into @entity4 jail where her baby was denied food and water and she was assaulted by a prison guard			1

' he told the house she had moved to @entity4 , but is ' now stranded there			2
' ' sadly , although @entity9 is a muslim , because she is a woman in a @entity116 country and because she is being reported by a man , even though he is @entity16 and , i believe , is not a @entity116 , she has to explain and defend herself to each set of police officers who come to arrest her and , when she goes to report at police stations and is detained , she has to go through the elaborate process of explaining her circumstances all over again			1
she is not able to work and is surviving on what her family can send to her from @entity10			2
' to compound @entity9 ’s misery , she found out last month that her husband had divorced her and had successfully sued for custody of their child in a sharia court in @entity4 more than 12 months ago			1
the rule in the @entity12 and under sharia law is that if 12 months have lapsed and the decision of the court has not been challenged , it is no longer appealable and is upheld			0
she was divorced and lost custody , but was not even aware of the fact			0
