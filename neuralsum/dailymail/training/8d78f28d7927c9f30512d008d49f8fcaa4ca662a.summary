by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 19:44 est , 29 november 2013 a @entity4 scientist has sparked anger by flying thousands of miles to @entity6 to do experiments on baboons that are banned in the @entity4			1
harrowing pictures show the intelligent and sociable creatures peering out of bare wire cages , babies clinging to each other for comfort and adults having pieces of their brain removed on the operating table			0
in one distressing image , a newly - caught baby is suckling its mother as she is given an identification tattoo at the primate research centre in @entity24			0
caged : a baby baboon clings to its mother as they gaze out of their wire enclosure at the research centre in @entity24 experiments on baboons and other primates caught in the wild are banned in @entity4 due to concerns about the suffering involved in trapping and transporting them			1
but an undercover investigation by the @entity38 has revealed that a @entity40 scientist is flying to @entity41 to do work on baboons captured on the @entity6 plains			1
the campaign group has accused neuroscientist @entity46 of bypassing @entity4 law and sidestepping the high welfare standards required in @entity4			1
professor @entity46 says his work could lead to vital new treatments for stroke patients and provide insights into other brain conditions such as motor neurone disease and @entity55 ’s			1
some 150,000 @entity4 suffer a stroke each year and the condition is the biggest cause of severe disability , with more than half of survivors left dependent on others for help with day - to - day life			1
professor @entity46 freely admits the experiments would n’t be allowed in the @entity4 but says that the welfare concerns behind the @entity4 ban do not apply to his work in @entity6			1
research : neuroscientist @entity46 has been accused of bypassing @entity4 law and he stresses that while animal welfare standards are n’t as high as they are here , they have improved greatly during his time there and that the centre is committed to making further changes			1
the row surrounds the @entity78 in @entity41 , which professor @entity46 has visited six times in the past two and a half years to do research on baboons caught in the wild			1
he is interested in an area deep inside the brain called the reticular formation , which is critical in regaining movement after a stroke and , in particular , control of the hand and wrist , something that is needed for dressing and other everyday tasks key to independence			2
some of his experiments , filmed secretly for the @entity38 and funded by the @entity4 taxpayer , involve cutting out pieces of the animal ’s brain , before using thin electrodes to stimulate the reticular formation			1
the experiments are done under anaesthesia			0
and , in line with welfare standards in the @entity4 , the animals are put down before they wake up			1
but the researcher has been accused of exploiting a cheap and plentiful source of animals			2
@entity110 , the @entity38 ’s director of special projects , said : ‘ if researchers respect the welfare standards of @entity4 laboratories then they should not accept lower standards when using non-uk facilities			1
‘ it makes a mockery of @entity4 law if researchers are able to just bypass policy and go overseas			1
‘ we are asking the @entity122 to close this loophole and we are asking the @entity24 government to stop using wild - caught baboons			2
the research industry talks about transparency and openness , but this is a dark secret			0
most people would be appalled to know that @entity4 researchers are going overseas to do research that would n’t be allowed in this country			2
’ photos taken at the institute earlier this year by the @entity38 show baboons being kept in bare single cages , despite the creatures being highly sociable animals that live in groups of up to 150 in the wild			2
@entity143 footage shows baboons pacing or circling in their cages			2
one , it is claimed , has been at the institute for 20 years			0
professor @entity46 told the @entity148 that one of his reasons for going to work at the @entity78 , which studies conditions from malaria to infertility , was to improve animal welfare standards			1
while almost all the baboons were kept in bare , single cages when he first went there , there have been big changes , including the building of large , split - level compounds with tree ‘ climbing frames ’			0
it is hoped that the single cages will be completely phased out before long			0
sedated : the baboons , which are caught in the wild , are put down after brain experiments he admitted that doing animal research in @entity4 was very expensive and said that going to @entity24 allows use of the large number of animals needed to advance his work			1
however , he said that the reasons behind the ban on using wild - caught primates in the @entity4 did n’t apply to his @entity6 experiments			2
this is because the creatures are caught humanely and are not being transported thousands of miles			0
in addition , far from being endangered , baboons are a pest and those used in his experiments would otherwise have been culled			0
professor @entity46 said : ‘ once you go beyond the simple “ you should n’t be using wild - caught animals ” , i do n’t think any of the reasons apply in this particular situation			2
’ he added that the part of the brain that is key to stroke recovery is so hard to reach that his experiments could not be done in any other way			0
the professor said : ‘ stroke is a very important condition that affects large numbers of people in the @entity4			1
‘ we have got better and better at treating people with stroke			0
they do n’t die from it but they are left with disability , and giving people an improved quality of life is really important			0
’ @entity78 director @entity210 said it was ‘ patronising ’ and ‘ insulting ’ to suggest that the institute was not interested in animal welfare			0
he added : ‘ i would admit that some of our old cages may not meet current standards for space and welfare but our strategy is to throw out the old and bring in the new			0
’ he added that the @entity78 ’s work is approved by the @entity24 government and said : ‘ the removal of abundant animals from the wild is both a species management issue as well as a source of animals for much - needed medical research on diseases that impose a high burden on @entity24 and globally			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity38 said : ‘ baboons are sociable , sentient and intelligent animals with strong family bonds			0
‘ this terrible suffering and mutilation is not necessary to improve the lives of people			0

neuroscientist @entity46 has been accused of bypassing @entity4 law
he has flown to @entity41 to do work on baboons captured on the plains
claims his work could lead to vital new treatments for stroke patients
could also provide insights into motor neurone disease and @entity55 *'s*
