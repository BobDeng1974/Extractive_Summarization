by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 03:13 est , 19 october 2013 they 've always been pretty shrewd about playing the property market			2
but even by the standards of @entity6 and @entity7 , their latest transaction is set to be particularly lucrative			0
a four - storey house bought for £ 1.29million for eldest son @entity9 has been put on the market for £ 2.35million – leaving the @entity11 with a potential £ 1million profit in just three years			1
shrewd : a four storey house bought by @entity6 and @entity7 , right , for their son @entity9 , left with new wife @entity16 , for £ 1.29million is now on the market for £ 2.35million just three years later there ’s one snag , however			1
the house is being marketed as containing a ‘ separate apartment ’ , even though planning permission has never been obtained for one			1
the @entity24 home was bought in the name of @entity9 , 29 , and his mother @entity26 in 2010			1
it immediately attracted controversy because of an attempt to get planning permission to separate the basement into a self - contained flat			1
@entity32 received an application to build steps down to the basement from the street , and to divide it into a separate flat			1
the internal stairs to the basement were to be removed			0
three neighbours complained , fearing greater pressure on parking , rubbish collection and other services , and after advice from the council the application was amended			0
on the market : the @entity24 property has an asking price of £ 2.35million this application retained the new external entrance – and its own kitchen – and was duly approved			1
however , a council officer noted in june 2010 : ‘ this permission does not authorise the use of the basement as a separate self - contained flat			1
’ by may 2011 , the council received a complaint that @entity9 had replaced a door to the upper floors with a wall , in an apparent attempt to create a separate basement flat			1
following ‘ enforcement action ’ the council was told the wall was being replaced by a door			0
but last year , the battle to create a separate flat resumed and , at one stage , a new number was placed on the basement door , along with a letter box			0
the council again took ‘ enforcement action ’ saying that it received a report of ‘ general nuisance ( loss of amenity ) ’ , involving the ‘ use of the basement as a self - contained flat ’			0
visits from the council led to a denial from @entity9 that he was using his basement as a separate flat , and the action ceased			0
but the property is now being marketed by @entity87 estate agents as having ‘ a separate apartment on the lower ground floor ’ ideal for a ‘ separate office or rental investment ’			2
there is no warning it still needs planning permission			0
last night sources at the estate agents claimed that the one - bedroom flat had been rented out for £ 1,200 a month			0
the source said a locked door on the stairs to the upper floors ensured the basement could be used as a separate home			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity11 refused to explain why both the house advert and estate agent suggested the basement was a self - contained home – but insisted @entity9 and @entity26 had done nothing wrong			1
‘ @entity32 has already accepted that there are two units , which is why it charges two separate council taxes , ’ the spokesman added			2
a spokesman for @entity32 said : ‘ no planning application has been received to divide this house into two dwellings – and following information received we have now started an investigation			2
’ another council spokesman said council tax valuations had no bearing on whether planning permission had been issued for the basement flat to be a separate dwelling			2
last month @entity9 married girlfriend @entity16 , 25 .			0

@entity24 house is on the market for £ 2.35million
the @entity11 bought it for £ 1.29million in @entity26 and @entity134 *'s* names in 2010
but the property is advertised as having a separate basement apartment - which @entity32 has never given permission for
