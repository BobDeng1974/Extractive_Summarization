when @entity2 the baby gorilla was rejected by her mother after birth , human surrogates stepped in to take over the role			1
and , as these touching photographs show , the adorable youngster does n't seem to know any differently , thanks to their fur - covered suits			2
on monday , @entity2 was flown by private jet from @entity11 , where she was born on august 16 , to @entity12 , where staff hope one of the female gorillas will take the baby in as their own			1
but before they try to integrate her with the troop , a team of 10 to 15 humans wearing furry vests and gloves will bottle feed and care for @entity2 for about 12 to 14 weeks			1
they will also wear masks because baby gorillas are susceptible to respiratory infections			2
she was flown to the zoo after being rejected by her mother in @entity32 after her birth last month holding on : @entity2 was taken out of her mother 's care 24 hours after her birth when the female gorilla showed no maternal instincts , putting her baby 's life in danger settling in : staff , who cover themselves with gorilla - like fur , are now hand - rearing the baby gorilla for three months before they introduce her to the gorilla troop @entity48 : staff hope that one of the female gorillas at @entity12 will take @entity2 in as their own when she gets to meet them in a few months ' [ @entity53 ] need to feel that closeness , they need to feel that love like they should from their mother on day one , ' @entity52 , the primate curator at the @entity12 , told the @entity57			1
staff will also move around like gorillas on their knuckles and make what they call ' gorilla vocalizations ' to @entity2 , a western lowland gorilla , so that she learns the sounds of her family - to - be			1
' they start learning life lessons , and language , and rules of etiquette from day one just like we do , ' @entity52 told @entity73			0
baby gorillas also rarely leave their mothers ' sides , meaning that the zoos in both @entity32 and @entity78 have relied on staff and volunteers to be with @entity2 around the clock			1
but ultimately , the baby will be handed over to her fellow gorillas			0
she will be ready to leave once she can walk on her own			0
heading to her new home : @entity2 was flown by private jet - to avoid respiratory illnesses - from @entity32 to @entity78 on monday with zoo staff on her way : the fur carried or worn by staff allows @entity2 to think she is with other gorillas			1
staff also move and make sounds like gorillas welcome to @entity95 ! she clings on to one of her carers as they emerge from the plane			1
baby gorillas rarely leave their mothers ' sides in their first few months @entity2 was forced to move homes after her mother , @entity106 , did not show any maternal care and put the newborn 's life at risk , @entity104 dr. @entity103 told @entity111			1
the zoo turned to @entity78 to see if they would be able to raise the baby , in line with the @entity116 guidelines @entity117			0
@entity11 staff , including @entity52 , took the private jet with her to her new home on monday			1
' she was in our laps the whole time			0
' @entity52 told the @entity57			0
' you can not put a gorilla that young into a crate like you could with an older animal			0
' the zoo recent had success with another rejected gorilla , @entity131 , who was also rejected by her mother in @entity134 , @entity135			2
she was flown to @entity78 in february 2013 and is now arguably the happiest animal in the entire zoo , @entity52 told @entity73			0
staff now hope @entity2 will have the same success			2
introductions : dr. @entity142 , from @entity143 , examines @entity2 in at the @entity12 on tuesday checks : staff hope that @entity2 , pictured at the new zoo , will be matched with a mother after another rejected baby gorilla found a home at the zoo last year looking good : dr. @entity142 checks on the health four - pound gorilla after she arrives in @entity95 earlier this week hello there ! specialists at the @entity156 from @entity157 oversaw the rescue plan for the endangered creature growing girl : staff will remain will @entity2 for 24 hours , seven days a week until she is walking on her own and ready to move in with the troop they have candidates to take on the role of her mother : @entity167 , who has proven to be a good mother , or @entity169 , who has no children but has shown an inclination to be motherly towards the younger members of the troop			1
another baby gorilla , @entity174 , was born just two weeks before @entity2 , so staff think she 'll also have a playmate when she is finally introduced			2
' over the next couple of months they will ease her in , ' @entity11 mammal curator @entity177 said			2
' it 's a very gradual process , and it 's important that protocol be followed			0
but we feel like she 's got a great chance to find a mom to take care of her			0
they 've had success there before , just like we have had success finding surrogates for chimpanzees			0
' @entity194 gorillas are an endangered species and there are believed to be fewer than 800 in the world			0
they live in heavy rainforests across @entity200 , which makes it difficult for scientists to know their exact numbers			0
hopeful : staff at @entity11 said they were sad to say goodbye to @entity2 but know that she has the best chance of meeting a new mother in @entity78			1

@entity2 was born at @entity11 in august but was rejected by her mother
with no other females who could adopt @entity2 , she was flown by private jet to @entity12 on monday
staff , wearing fur suits and gloves , will care for her around the clock and move and make sounds like gorillas
in three months , she will join the gorilla troop ; staff are hopeful one of the females will take her in as their own
