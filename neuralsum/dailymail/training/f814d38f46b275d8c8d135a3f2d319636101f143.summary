by @entity0 published : 08:05 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 08:20 est , 7 february 2013 an abandoned pig was found wandering the streets of @entity3 after his owners dumped him for getting too big			1
eight - month - old @entity6 , who was found by policemen out on patrol , was left malnourished and suffering from an infectious skin condition on @entity10			1
the piglet was taken in by stunned @entity13 staff who discovered that he refused to eat normal pig food and was malnourished after being fed sandwiches by his former owners			1
eight - month - old @entity6 is now living in an @entity13 centre in @entity3			1
the staff there are attempting to nurse him back to health @entity6 turned his nose up at fruit and veg when staff tried to bring his weight up to normal , as the only food he would eat was bread			1
he is now being cared for at the @entity13 centre in @entity29			0
@entity30 , @entity31 at the @entity13 's @entity3 centre , said : ' @entity6 was not in a good way when he was found , he 'd obviously been kept by someone who had no idea how to look after a pig			1
' he was n't in a good state , and unfortunately the only thing he would eat was bread so we can only assume the only food he 's ever been fed is sandwiches			0
' i 've never seen a pig abandoned on the street before , it is unbelievably cruel , especially on @entity10 when the streets were busy , fireworks were going off and he would have been very frightened			2
' staff believe @entity6 is a @entity50 pig , which are regularly used by breeders to farm ' micro pigs ' @entity6 ( left ) is a much happier pig now that he lives in the @entity13 centre being treated by @entity55 ( right ) @entity6 is the latest micro-pig to be abandoned after his owners found he grew too large @entity13 staff have found that @entity6 will only eat bread , showing that his owners did not know how to feed and care for a pig properly ms @entity30 added : ' he is n't tagged as a farm animal would be , so we think he has been kept in someone 's home as a micro pig			1
he 's at the age when they just start maturing and becoming a bit more aggressive and getting a lot bigger and it looks like someone has just thrown him out on the street			2
' @entity6 is such a lovely boy			2
we are working on getting him back to full health and then finding him a knowledgeable home where he can roam around outside at his heart 's content			0
' micro pigs became fashionable after a series of celebrities , such as @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity82 's , bought them as pets			0
but experts warn that pigs are not easy animals to look after , they will tear up a garden , and they have to have things to chew on to wear down their teeth			0
when the tiny piglets grow bigger than their owners were warned , they often end up being handed in to animal rescue centres			0
another abandoned piglet named dr @entity96 was found sheltering from the snow in a bucket using a pair of old jeans as a blanket near @entity102 , @entity103			1
a piglet named dr @entity96 was found sleeping in a bucket sheltering from the snow under a pair of old jeans near @entity102 dr @entity96 , pictured with carer @entity108 , is now being cared for by charity @entity109 in @entity110 an elderly lady raised the alarm after spotting the three - month - old pig in a field living on scraps			1
he was also found underweight , malnourished and suffering from a skin condition but has been taken to re-homing charity @entity109 in @entity110 to be nursed back to health			2
ms @entity30 said : ' people are breeding ' micro ' pigs following a surge in demand after people see them on the telly , and watch reality stars carrying them about in their handbags			0
' but often , all they do is breed the runts of the litter with each other , so it 's genetically likely their offspring will be small , but you never know how big they will grow until they 're about a year old			0
' we 'd really encourage people to think twice before taking on any pet , but especially an unusual animal like a pig			0
they need a lot of looking after			0
