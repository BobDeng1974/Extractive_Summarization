as lava courses through @entity2 ’s @entity2 towards a shopping centre , residents are making plans to keep well out of its way			1
but what happens if you are faced with the prospect of walking on lava ? on a holiday to @entity13 in @entity2 , neuroscientist @entity11 decided to find out , when his tour guide offered to tread into a pool of scorching molten rock			1
the tour guide ’s boot is shown to make a small impression , sparking a flame which bounced off the surface			1
‘ while this may not be surprising ( it is liquid rock ) , i think that many people think of lava as more of a hot - watery - like substance , ’ said mr @entity11 who is originally from @entity36			1
‘ you would never fall into a lava lake the way you would a swimming pool , the molten rock is much more dense , so you would simply land on it , sink a little , and be burned			0
’ the tour guide ’s shoe is shown to make a small impression , sparking a flame which bounced off the surface heating up : @entity25 is currently moving through @entity2 ’s @entity2 towards a shopping centre , and residents are making plans to keep well out of its way the word lava can be used to describe molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the rock that solidifies and cools after an eruption			1
when first erupted from a volcano , lava is a liquid and its temperature ranges from 700 to 1,200 ° @entity69 it is up to 100,000 times as viscous - thick and sticky - as water			1
a ' lava flow ' is when lava flows from a volcano and is created during a ' non-explosive effusive eruption			2
' when it has stopped moving , lava solidifies to form igneous rock			0
explosive eruptions create a mixture of volcanic ash and other fragments called tephra , rather than lava flows			0
@entity13 is thought to be 300,000 to 600,000 years old and is one of the most active volcanoes in the world			2
it has continuously erupted since 1983			0
lava from @entity13 volcano has been threatening @entity92 town , which has a population of about 900 , for months			1
in october , it burned a house and covered part of a cemetery but stalled just before hitting @entity92 's main road			0
‘ at certain locations , and only under proper guidance and safety procedures , you can visit some of the lava fronts			0
it is truly one of the most amazing things to witness , ’ said mr @entity11			2
the video follows footage which emerged last year showing a man taking five steps up a flow of lava on @entity113 in @entity114			1
the film was analysed by a geoscientist who has confirmed it is possible to walk on lava			0
@entity119 , from @entity120 in @entity121 , explained in his @entity122 that when boiling hot lava hits the cool air , it forms a dark crust that can be stood on - albeit for a short period of time			0
and although lava appears to flow like a stream , it is more viscous than water , which mr @entity119 claims means it can withstand a small amount of pressure			1
@entity13 is thought to be 300,000 to 600,000 years old and is one of the most active volcanoes in the world in a previous blog post , mr @entity138 explained that falling into lava would cause the water inside a human body to boil , turn to steam and the person would ' explode from within			1
' and it is n't just feet that are being tested in lava			0
there is a whole @entity150 channel dedicated to throwing cans of food and drink into the molten material			0
in one video , lavapix shows how a can of ravioli would slowly melt away when covered in lava , and eventually explode			2
' do n't try this at home , ' filmmaker @entity161 cautions			0
' of course if you do have a lava flow at your house , trying this is the least of your problems			2
' safety precautions were taken and only the @entity169 was slightly in harms way			0
' @entity13 is the youngest and most active @entity172 shield volcano , located on the southern part of the island defence : a geologist uses a handheld gps unit to mark the lava flow margin coordinates in @entity92 on friday			1
lava from @entity13 volcano has been threatening @entity92 town , which has a population of about 900			2

@entity185 neuroscientist , @entity11 , took the footage in @entity13 , @entity2
