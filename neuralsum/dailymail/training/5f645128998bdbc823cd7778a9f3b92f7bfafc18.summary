’ investigators have warned that abusers ’ methods are becoming more sophisticated with many researching the homes and schools of their targets using tools such as @entity138			0

dr @entity201 has found that exposure to pornography makes teenage boys more likely to view women as objects , engage in risky behaviour , and have sex earlier ' i was about 12 and this person started talking to me on the internet and said he was around my age			1
' he 'd steer the conversation in a way where it was turning a bit dirty , then he 'd start asking for other types of pictures as well			0
if you try and say " oh i do n't want to talk about that ' or ' whatever " , he 'd threaten or blackmail me , saying that he 'd send my dad all the chat logs if i did n't do what he said			0
i just thought you would n't blackmail someone you 're supposed to be in love with so i just told him to shut up and sent him a couple more photos but he started to do that every week			0
' my teacher said i 'd been acting depressed and they sorted me out with counselling			0
i 'd started to self harm as well because everything just came together at the same time , and i was really upset and just needed a release			0
' luckily i 'm a fairly strong person and i can get over things - i 've learned to just push them away			0
but what if it was someone who was n't , who was a weaker - minded person than me , what would have happened ? they might have committed suicide or something , and it would n't have even been their fault - it would be because people were n't there for them			0
' teenage girls will welcome @entity253 ’s plans for online porn filters because they are sick of seeing it , according to an expert who has studied the effect of web porn on young people			2
dr @entity260 , a psychologist at @entity261 , said many girls were exposed to explicit content against their will on social networking sites			0
she suggested the government could go further , perhaps bringing in the @entity268 system under which adults can only access online porn by signing a form at their post office			2
this would ensure children would be protected from hardcore images , while over- 18s			1
dr @entity260 said blocking unsuitable content could change the ‘ sexualised wallpaper ’ of young people ’s lives			0
she was the lead author of a report for the @entity282 earlier this year , which assessed 30 years of research			2
it found that porn can lead to boys viewing girls as sex objects , indulging in risky sexual behaviour and having sex earlier			1
mr @entity253 has promised that all homes will be asked to decide whether they wanted to impose a filter , with ‘ yes ’ as the default option			0
dr @entity260 said that although it might not be possible to ‘ stamp it out completely ’ but we should ‘ provide people with the option ’ .			0
