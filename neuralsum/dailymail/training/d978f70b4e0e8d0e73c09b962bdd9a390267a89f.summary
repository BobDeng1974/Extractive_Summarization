new audio reveals how @entity26 called for help with ' crowd control ' seen : video footage captured officer @entity21 pacing near @entity4 's body after he had shot the teenager police presence : audio recordings disclose that @entity2 police asked for more officers to come to the scene shooting : officer @entity21 shot @entity4 dead in august after a confrontation between the unarmed teenager and the officer the recordings are part of a second evidence dump promised as part of prosecutor @entity46 ’s controversial decision to publicly release @entity48 evidence without a judge ’s sanction and while @entity51 and @entity53 investigations into the shooting remain ongoing			1
the @entity2 dispatchers repeated calls for all available units in @entity2 and @entity58 provides an audible timeline of the situation on the ground in the @entity63 town where angry , mourning crowds – estimated by some to number in the hundreds – had gathered on the stretch of street where @entity4 ’s body lay , uncovered for four hours			1
the recordings filed in sequence reveal that medical services were only requested after several calls for police backup and detectives were placed			2
in his own testimony @entity21 admitted that he made no calls for medics and no witness statement has him approaching @entity4 to test for any signs of life			1
after the dispatcher puts out a call for ‘ any available @entity2 units , ’ the officer on the ground renews his request with increased urgency : ‘ we ’re going to need crowd control over here			1
’ @entity2 grand jury ’s decision not to indict former @entity2 officer @entity21 , 28 , for the fatal shooting this summer which saw him pump six bullets into unarmed teen was the spark that saw protests catch fire across the country			1
protest : demonstrations have swept @entity103 under the ' hands up , do n't shoot ' slogan and have now embraced the ' i ca n't breathe ' slogan prompted by the death of @entity109 as a police officer used a chokehold while arresting him in @entity112 , @entity113 , for selling single cigarettes			0
@entity115 : @entity117 ' star @entity116 warms up before an @entity119 basketball game against the @entity120 at the @entity121 wearing an ' i ca n't breathe ' t - shirt before a match watched by prince @entity124 and @entity125 , the @entity125 spreading : @entity116 , the @entity117 star became the latest sportsman to wear t - shirts with slogans inspired by the deaths of @entity4 and @entity109 as he warmed up ahead of a basketball fixture watched by @entity124 and the @entity125 in @entity132 , @entity113			2
marching under the banner , ‘ @entity134 ’ – taken from the widely discredited testimony of @entity4 ’s companion that day , @entity136 – protesters took to the streets of @entity2 , @entity63 , @entity58 and beyond			1
five @entity140 players drew praise and opprobrium in equal measure when they walked onto the field with their hands held up in support of @entity4			2
a @entity113 grand jury ’s decision not to indict @entity112 officer @entity149 for the fatal chokehold arrest of @entity151 was met with similar outrage by protesters in the streets of @entity113 , @entity155 and cities across the @entity157			1
@entity113 mayor , @entity158 refused to endorse the @entity48 ’s decision			0
he described the failure to indict in the face of damning video footage and the @entity163 ’s finding of ‘ death by homicide , ’ as ‘ a national moment of grief			0
’ last night spectators at the basketball game attended by @entity124 and the @entity125 wore ‘ i ca n’t breathe ’ t - shirts , a reference to @entity109 ’s dying words as he begged @entity174 to release him from his fatal hold			0
summit : @entity113 mayor @entity177 met president @entity178 at the @entity179 over the escalating concerns about relations between police and the black community after the @entity109 and @entity4 rulings escalation : in @entity187 , @entity188 , there has been violence four nights in a row with police using tear gas an baton rounds against protesters			2
secret wedding : officer @entity21 married his partner @entity198 shortly before the grand jury reached his decision @entity174 remains at work , though off patrol			1
officer @entity21 who had been in hiding and on paid administrative leave last week resigned from @entity204 citing as his reasons the threat to his brother officers ’ safety that his continued service would bring and his hope that his action would ‘ help the community heal			2
’ he married his partner , fellow @entity2 cop @entity198 during his time in hiding and announced that they are expecting their first child in a post @entity48 television interview			2
and though he resigned without severance pay , fundraising efforts of his supporters have garnered him a potential war chest of $ 1million			0
@entity4 ’s family may yet bring a civil case against the officer			2
and while @entity21 ’s supporters have pointed to conflicting eye witness accounts of the shooting and insist that the officer feared for his life , @entity226 last week revealed that @entity21 himself changed his story about just what happened in the crucial moments that lead to his fatal encounter with @entity4			1
in @entity21 ’s now very public account of his encounter with @entity4 and @entity136 on august 9 he has claimed that he asked @entity4 and @entity239 to move to the sidewalk rather than walk in the street			1
when they walked on , @entity21 has repeatedly stated , he realized they matched the description of two suspects wanted in connection with the robbery of nearby @entity249			0
a youth matching @entity4 ’s description had stolen a box of @entity254 cigarillos			0
it was this realization , he stated , that caused him to reverse his vehicle and sparked the car - side confrontation that left @entity4 dead on the street with six bullets in his body			1
but the sworn testimony of @entity21 ’s squad supervisor directly contradicts this account			0
@entity21 ’s supervisor was the first officer to speak with the 28 - year - old cop following the shooting			2
the men spoke before @entity269 had even been notified of the incident and before the medical examiner or investigating officers had arrived on the scene			0
at that time , the @entity274 admitted , ‘ he [ @entity21 ] did not know anything about the stealing call			0
’ when pressed by the attorney questioning him the officer reiterated that @entity21 , ‘ did not know anything			0
’ asked , ‘ he told you he did n’t know about there being a stealing at @entity282 ? ’ the officer responded , ‘ @entity284			0
’ nor did he make any mention of reversing back towards the youths			0
in fact the @entity274 stated that , in several subsequent conversations , @entity21 said ‘ he did not have that call			0
’ the first batch of @entity48 evidence , released on the day of their decision and reviewed by @entity226 , has revealed a litany of failures to follow protocol			0
@entity21 handed in and bagged his own gun in direct contradiction to recognised @entity58 procedure which demands strict guidelines in the securing and sealing of a weapon when fired by an officer with fatal consequences			1
theft : officer @entity21 's evidence that he was aware of the robbery of a store in @entity2 by @entity4 directly contradicted what he had told his squad supervisor immediately after the shooting the weapon was not brushed for fingerprints , key measurements were not taken at the scene , interviews were not recorded or annotated			1
photographs were not taken because a battery was flat in the relevant officer ’s camera			0
and though @entity21 claimed that he had feared for his life and that , punched twice by @entity4 in a tussel by his squad vehicle , he feared a third punch might kill him , medical records show him to have sustained nothing more serious that mild bruising to his jawline .			1
