@entity3 ( pictured with his wife , @entity7 , and his children , @entity9 and @entity10 ) has been hiccuping every seven seconds for the last 14 months			0
he has undergone numerous tests but none have offered a solution the problem is so bad , that they sometimes cause him to pass out and keep him awake for hours at night			1
he also spends many nights in the spare room so his long - suffering wife , @entity7 , can get some sleep			0
mr @entity3 has seen a number of experts , had two endoscopies , a ct scan , changed his diet , taken tranquilisers and consulted a chiropractor - all in vain			1
the software worker with @entity30 is now waiting for an mri scan fearing that the hiccups may be an indication of a serious medical problem			1
he said : ‘ they ’ve taken over my life			0
i woke up with them one morning after a stag do and i ’ve had them ever since			1
‘ i ’ve no idea why they started - i ’d had more to drink than i had for some time but it was nothing out of the ordinary , just the usual mix of beer and spirits			1
mr @entity49 ( pictured with his wife , @entity7 ) has hiccupped an estimated 5.25 million times since the problem began in july last year			1
he has to sleep in the spare room so he does n't disturb his wife ‘ some days are worse than others and on odd days they ’ll stop , but they can get so bad i pass out or throw up my food			1
‘ there are times when i ca n’t breathe for 30 seconds because they lock up my diaphragm			1
‘ nights are bad and sometimes i wake up and the whole bed is shaking because they are so violent and i ’ll go to sleep in a different room so @entity7 can get some rest			2
‘ i ’ve learned to control them to some extent and disguise them and hiccup quietly but when i stop thinking about them they start sounding again			0
‘ people find it quite funny when they first meet me but then it becomes quite annoying for someone to have to listen to			0
’ mr @entity49 says he has tried all the tricks he has come across to stop his hiccups - including eating sugar and vinegar ( pictured )			1
he says a chiropractor gave him some relief but that the hiccups soon returned mr @entity3 , father to @entity9 , three , and 10 month - old @entity10 , says he has been able to continue working as he is deskbound and has little contact with people outside his office			2
he said : ‘ i ’ve tried all the old wives ’ tales like eating sugar and vinegar and all manner of supposed cures , but nothing ’s worked			0
‘ last month i had some relief after seeing a chiropractor who manipulated the phrenic nerve in my neck which is connected to the diaphragm			0
mr @entity49 said : ' i 've to try to keep cheerful but i 'm at the stage now where i 'm scraping the barrel for ideas and looking for people to help me			1
' he is pictured trying to stop the hiccups by breathing into a paper bag ‘ they stopped for ten days and i thought i ’d finally got rid of them - but then they started again and are as bad as ever			1
‘ i ’ve to try to keep cheerful but i ’m at the stage now where i ’m scraping the barrel for ideas and looking for people to help me			0
‘ the medical community does n’t seem to know what to do , but it is quite rare			0
‘ i ’m told there ’s only a handful of people in the world at this moment who will have hiccups as bad			1
’ mr @entity3 decided to have an mri scan after reading of @entity118 , 29 , from @entity119 , who had hiccups for nearly three years before a scan in 2008 detected a brain tumour			1
mr @entity3 , from @entity123 , @entity124 , said : ‘ obviously that ’s a worst - case scenario but i need to have one done at least to eliminate it			0
’ mrs @entity127 , 38 , said : ‘ he ’s in a bad way and they are getting him down			2
‘ he ’s constantly losing his breath and it ’s difficult for anyone to concentrate on anything else when he ’s around			0
‘ they can wake me up in the night and i then lie there waiting for the next one and i have to send him out of the room			0
’ she added : ‘ he ’s had blood tests and tried different diets , thinking they might be related to gluten but nothing ’s worked			2
‘ we seem to have exhausted the stomach route and are now looking at nerves as being a possible cause			0
‘ he ’s seen a chiropractor who thought it could be related to his posture and he had 12 days ’ relief but they came back again really bad @entity152			2
‘ we are just desperate to find someone who can help him because the hiccups are ruining our lives			2
’ hiccups occur when the diaphragm - a thin membrane of muscles separating the chest from the abdomen - suddenly and involuntarily contracts			2
as the diaphragm contracts , it causes a person to breathe in air very quickly			0
this air is stopped when the vocal cords close suddenly - this produces the characteristic sound of a hiccup			0
they are very common and are usually short - lived			0
short - term hiccups can be caused by consuming alcohol , excessive smoking , a bloated stomach , a sudden change in temperature , shock and excitement			1
occasionally , and usually in men , hiccups can be longer - lived			2
these hiccups can be caused by gastrointestinal conditions , respiratory conditions , problems of the central nervous system or psychological conditions			1
they can also be caused by a reaction to medications including anaesthetics , sedatives and anti-seizure medication			2
prolonged hiccups can cause insomnia , weight loss , exhaustion and depression			0
treatment for long - lived hiccups usually involves establishing and treating the underlying cause			0
however , in some cases , medication can help			0

@entity49 , 37 , woke up with hiccups and a hangover in july 2012
it is estimated he has hiccuped around *5.25million* times over this time
the hiccups are so bad they sometimes cause him to pass out or vomit
has seen many experts and had tests but none have *revealed* the cause
he is now concerned the hiccups could be caused by a brain tumour so he is awaiting an @entity224 scan
