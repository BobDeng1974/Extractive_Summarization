‘ what he has not done in my eyes is commit murder			0
he genuinely thought , and i have absolutely no reason to disbelieve him , that that insurgent was already dead			0
’ she said her husband is ashamed of his actions , and that his behaviour was a moment of madness brought on by the mental strain of active service			0
she told the @entity39 : ‘ he ’s been convicted of murder , but everything that defines @entity42 points me and everyone who knows him in completely the opposite direction – he is not made that way			0
