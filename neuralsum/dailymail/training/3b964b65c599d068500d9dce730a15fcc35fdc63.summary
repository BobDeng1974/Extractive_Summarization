by @entity0 @entity1 always ensured that her daughter had not one , but two asthma inhalers at primary school			1
@entity6 was diagnosed with severe asthma at just three months old , and her mother knew how quickly her attacks could escalate , and that she needed her inhaler within seconds			2
when @entity6 was 11 , she had an asthma attack just as the school day was finishing			1
@entity1 was n't worried , as she knew she 'd immediately be able to get one of inhalers - one was kept in reception , and the other in her daughter 's classroom			1
' i came to pick @entity6 up from school and knew straight away that she was at the beginning of an attack , ' recalls @entity1 , 36 , a full - time mother , who lives with her husband @entity24 , 41 , a shop manager , @entity6 , now 13 , and son @entity25 , ten , in @entity26			1
@entity1 ( @entity27 ) and daughter @entity6 , 13 , ( r ) who had an asthma attack at school ' she was pale and blotchy , and i could hear her wheezing			1
she 'd been too shy to say anything to her teacher			0
' what @entity6 needed was her reliever inhaler - these usually come in a blue container and contain salbutamol , which quickly relaxes the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways to make breathing easier ( this is different from preventer inhalers , taken daily , which contain low - dose steroids to build up protection by reducing long - term inflammation in the airways )			2
@entity1 asked for the inhaler kept at reception			1
but renovation works meant the inhaler had been locked in a cupboard for safekeeping			2
the deputy head had a key , but she 'd gone home			0
@entity6 's wheezing was getting worse			0
@entity1 asked the receptionist to fetch the second inhaler from her classroom			1
thirty minutes later , he returned and said it was nowhere to be found			0
by this point , someone had alerted the deputy head , who 'd returned to school to unlock the cupboard and get the other inhaler , but @entity6 was now struggling to breathe			1
' i always remain outwardly very calm as it keeps @entity68 calm , but inside i felt a rising panic , ' says @entity1			1
' her wheezing had become severe and i knew she needed to get to hospital because it 's happened many times before			0
it 's five minutes away , so i drove her there			0
she was treated in @entity74 and then transferred to intensive care , where she had asthma drugs through an intravenous line			0
' @entity6 's inhalers were n't accessible she adds that @entity6 spent the next four days in hospital			1
she went straight back to school when she came out , but had to take it easy and her dose of oral steroids was temporarily increased			2
it 's a common story , says the charity @entity86			0
a child has an asthma attack at school and needs their inhaler , but for some reason it 's not accessible			1
secondary school children can carry their own inhalers , but even that does n't guarantee access			1
' a worrying 86 per cent of children say they have been without their own inhaler because they have forgotten , lost , broken or run out of it , ' says @entity98 , the charity 's chief executive			2
the ideal solution would be for schools to hold a spare emergency inhaler in their first - aid kits , but it 's illegal to do so because it 's a prescription - only medication			2
with one in 11 @entity86 children having asthma , it 's a pressing issue			0
asthma @entity86 has been campaigning since 2011 to get the law changed to allow schools to hold a spare inhaler			2
as @entity98 explains : ' the equivalent of a classroom of children die because of asthma every year			0
we know it could really make a difference because more than two - thirds of children with asthma in the @entity86 have had an attack while at school			1
' the school environment has many potential triggers for an asthmatic child , adds @entity126 , a clinical lead nurse for the charity			1
these include exercise during @entity131 lessons or break time , sudden changes in temperature ( going from a warm classroom to a cold playground ) , exam / test stress , and wood dust or glues from woodwork lessons			0
prescription - only medication can only be administered to a named person , which has prevented schools from carrying a spare - as the drugs watchdog , the @entity148 points out , this also applies to adrenaline injections known as @entity150 , which are administered during severe allergic reactions			0
asthma @entity86 wants an exemption to this rule for schools , allowing them to administer an inhaler to any child registered as asthmatic who has a parental consent form signed in advance			1
' reliever inhalers have a standard dosage and there would be clear guidance about when and how the spare inhaler should be used , ' explains @entity126			2
' there is no danger , however , if an inhaler is used unnecessarily - the worst that can happen is some shakiness and an increased heart rate , but this soon passes and causes no harm			2
' fourteen - year - old @entity175 , from @entity176 , @entity177 , carries his inhaler with him , as he needs to use it at least three times a week , especially during winter and the pollen season , as the cold and pollen are two of his triggers			2
' but one day last year , i left it by the side of the football pitch during @entity131 and forgot to pick it up after the lesson , ' he says			0
' i went back to retrieve it as soon as i remembered , but someone had trodden on it and it was in pieces			0
' that lunchtime , @entity175 played football with his friends			0
' i did n't want to sit inside and be a misery , ' he says			2
' after a few minutes , though , i started feeling really breathless and knew it could lead to an attack			0
i would usually have had a puff on my inhaler , but i could n't , so i stopped straight away and managed to get my breathing under control by staying calm and taking long , deep breaths			1
' it could have been a lot worse			0
i felt so panicky that i did n't have my inhaler			1
having an asthma attack is terrifying - it 's like having a plug in your throat and you ca n't breathe in - and the thought that i could n't access the medicine that can save my life made me really anxious			1
' it 's my responsibility to carry my inhaler now that i 'm in secondary school , but i 've misplaced it more than once as i have so many bags and books to remember			1
@entity6 was treated in @entity74 and then transferred to intensive care , where she had asthma drugs ' i wish that my school was allowed to have an emergency inhaler , and i think they wish they could , too ! i know several people at school who 've been without their inhaler at some point , and once had to lend mine to a boy who 'd left his at home			1
' a lack of a spare inhaler in school can have tragic consequences			1
eight - year - old @entity239 died after having an asthma attack in school in october 2010			1
her mother @entity241 was called to bring in a spare inhaler , but by the time she arrived , the school had called an ambulance and @entity239 was on the floor being given cpr by the paramedics			1
it was too late to save her			0
' things might have been very different for @entity239 if the school had been able to keep an emergency inhaler on site , ' says @entity241 , 34 , from @entity252			1
during an asthma attack , two main things happen , explains dr @entity255 , consultant in respiratory medicine at @entity257 , @entity26			1
' the airways become inflamed and can become clogged with extra mucus , and the muscles of the airways spasm , causing them to narrow			0
if left untreated , this can lead to the airways becoming completely blocked , causing a fatal attack			0
' a reliever inhaler can have an instant effect and prevent the attack from progressing to status asthmaticus , a stage where the airways becomes unresponsive to the reliever inhaler and the person needs hospital intervention			1
' every second counts once a child starts having an attack , adds @entity126			0
' the school could call an ambulance , but that takes time and could be prevented if the child has guaranteed access to an inhaler at all times			2
' the good news is that the government is expected to announce a consultation on the issue soon , which could lead to a change in the law			0
this could happen as soon as october , in time for the winter cough and cold season - a trigger for many asthmatics			0
for the @entity294 family this is welcome news			0
@entity239 's sister , @entity295 , five , also has asthma - ' she understands what happened to her sister , ' says her father @entity299			0
' she has an inhaler in her classroom , but i would feel much more at ease if i knew there was also a spare inhaler on site in case of emergencies			0
if this campaign can save just one child 's life , it will have been a huge success			0
' asthma @entity86 would like anyone with experience of being without an inhaler in school to tell their story during the government consultation			2

@entity1 , 36 , from @entity26 , always ensured her daughter had inhaler
but when it was n't accessible at school asthmatic *saarah* , 13 , had an attack
