read chief sports writer @entity0 's full column - including why @entity2 will not return to @entity3 on loan many times we agonise over the state and status of the @entity9 game			1
are we better than @entity10 ? are we better than @entity11 ? maybe not , but think on this			0
in june 1995 , @entity13 signed for @entity14 after two difficult seasons with @entity16			2
his time there had deteriorated to such an extent that a newspaper giving a facetious award for the ‘ @entity22 ’ renamed it ‘ @entity24 ’			0
when @entity13 left , @entity16 owner @entity25 predicted he would not score 10 goals for @entity14 : the @entity27 could not believe they had got their money back			1
that is how it was then			0
@entity9 clubs were way down @entity33 ’s pecking order , the dumping ground for rejects or players looking for a last pay day			2
the same year as @entity13 joined @entity14 , 32 - year - old @entity38 signed for @entity39 on a free transfer , having suffered massive injuries			1
@entity42 , one of the finest midfield players in the country , meanwhile , was sold by @entity45 to @entity16 at the age of 27			0
@entity47 arrived in @entity9 in 1995 after an unsuccessful spell with @entity16 @entity38 ( right ) was another big - name player who came to @entity9 during the end of his career @entity53 ( right ) shakes hands with @entity55 after sealing a loan move to @entity16 last week the @entity58 international arrived at @entity16 's training ground , @entity60 , on saturday @entity53 was mobbed by jubiliant @entity16 fans at @entity16 's @entity62 upon his arrival in @entity27 @entity64 ( centre ) was let go by @entity45 earlier in the summer and joined @entity16 @entity66 ( right ) left @entity39 for @entity67 in the latter part of his career - not during his prime now , two decades on , look at us			1
@entity53 can not get in the team at @entity14 , so where does he go ? @entity16			1
he arrived in @entity27 on friday to complete a loan deal with a view to a £ 5million transfer			0
@entity64 waited until approaching his 33rd birthday before swapping @entity45 for the @entity76 , too			0
now @entity77 , who can not get into @entity79 ’ team , is holding out for his second loan move to @entity81			0
the decline of the @entity16 giants — @entity84 are seventh , @entity16 11th coming out of @entity27 ’s winter break — has been dramatic , but this shift in power runs deeper			2
@entity66 had played his best years in the @entity88 and could not even make @entity9 ’s team at the @entity90 , so decamped to @entity67			1
@entity27 ’s relationship with @entity9 football has reversed			1
@entity93 , @entity94 and @entity11 may be the might of @entity33 right now — but we forget how it once was for @entity9 clubs and how much has changed for us to even aspire to their level .			0

in the 1990s @entity27 football was more *dominant* than the @entity9 game
players like @entity38 would come to @entity9 at the end of their careers
two decades on , @entity88 players have their *swansongs* in @entity27
@entity64 and @entity66 went to @entity27 after their prime years
@entity53 joined @entity16 on loan after losing his place at @entity14
