a lawyer for the family of the black 18 - year - old shot dead by white officer @entity3 has slammed the grand jury process as ' unfair ' just hours before the anticipated verdict			1
seven men and five women have spent three months deliberating over evidence to decide whether to charge @entity3 with the august 9 shooting that sparked violent protests across @entity11 , @entity12 , and nationwide			1
the conflicted suburb of @entity14 , @entity12 , is now bracing itself for outcry , with the deployment of the @entity17 , grenade - armed police officers , and almost 100 @entity20 agents			2
' unfair ' : @entity21 , attorney for @entity23 's family , said the case should have gone straight to trial and despite calls for calm from @entity23 's mother and president @entity30 , attorney @entity21 has revealed the family does not trust the procedure , which could see officer @entity3 avoid trial			1
' the process is completely unfair , ' @entity21 told @entity35			2
he added : ' i have no doubt if they were to indict the police officer , he would be guaranteed his full constitutional rights of innocent until proven guilty			2
' he would get every benefit of the doubt			0
' i do n't worry about the due process for officer @entity3			2
i worry about the due process for the little black boy dead on the ground			0
' his words come as authorities in @entity50 erect barricades around @entity52 , where the jury is expected to announce its verdict on monday morning			1
@entity56 prosecuting attorney @entity55 called for a jury - made up of nine white and three black people to reflect the racial make up of the county - to decide whether officer @entity3 should be charged			1
anger : @entity63 words came hours before the jury is expected to decide whether @entity3 should be indicted outrage : the august 9 shooting of @entity23 , 18 , has sparked outrage across @entity50 and the nation tributes : mourners paid tribute in the streets on sunday during the tense wait for the jury to conclude following evidence from officer @entity3 , forensic pathologists and witnesses , the panel will have to decide whether @entity3 intentionally violated @entity23 's civil rights by fatally shooting him			1
@entity21 said : ' i just think this is process is unlike anything i 've ever seen in my 20 years of practice			0
we do n't think it 's fair			0
' if this prosecutor says ... we 're not going to recommend any charges , that 's different from anything he 's done in his past 28 years with grand juries			0
' he added : ' why ca n't it be equal justice ? why ca n't we have the same process ? ' last month , legal experts told @entity97 the charge is more complex and difficult to prove than a murder or manslaughter charge			1
@entity101 , a professor at the @entity102 in @entity14 , told @entity97 the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter , as the 12 jury members will have to be certain @entity3 intended to violate @entity23 's civil rights by shooting him dead			2
protests : grenade - armed police have been deployed for fear of violent reactions to the jury 's verdict conflict : hundreds of people have been arrested since the unrest began almost four months ago racial divides : demonstrators have accused the county police force of racism in the majority black district ' the civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction			1
the federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse			0
' there are some criminal charges that do n't involve that kind of mental state , like murder			0
they can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly , but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right			0
' as a result , he said , they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove @entity3 's account if they are to find him guilty			0
@entity149 law professor @entity148 told @entity97 an innocent verdict would ' totally undermine the @entity14 criminal justice system '			0
' if a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self - defense that simply is not plausible , ' he said			1
@entity23 's mother @entity156 has urged protesters to refrain from violence , and president @entity30 has called for calm			0
@entity30 added that he has not ruled out a trip to @entity50 following the announcement of the jury 's verdict .			1

@entity21 questions why the prosecutor did n't take case to trial
says ' he would have been guaranteed his rights , why no equal justice ? '
barricades have been erected across @entity50 , @entity12 , and *schools* are slated to close for fear of violent reactions to the grand jury verdict
7 men and 5 women - 9 white , 3 black - deciding whether to indict @entity3
@entity30 said he may visit @entity50 following the verdict
