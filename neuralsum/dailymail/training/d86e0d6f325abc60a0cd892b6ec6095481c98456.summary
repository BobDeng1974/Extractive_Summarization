by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:52 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:48 est , 30 december 2013 happy hearts : a synthetic pregnancy hormone has been found to slash death rates for people with acute heart failure a pregnancy hormone could provide the first breakthrough in 20 years for treating acute heart failure			1
doctors found that @entity11 , a synthetic version of the hormone relaxin , can slash the death rate for people with the condition			1
heart failure , which affects around 900,000 people in the @entity18 , means the heart can no longer pump enough blood around the body			1
the body tries to compensate by increasing the heart rate and narrowing blood vessels to push up blood pressure			1
but in the long term these put the heart under greater strain			1
as the heart becomes less efficient , blood can pool in vessels around the lungs ; the pressure builds up and fluid leaks from the blood vessels into the tiny air sacs , causing breathlessness , tiredness and swelling			1
current medications such as beta blockers and ace inhibitors reduce stress on the heart by , for example , lowering blood pressure			1
this helps alleviate symptoms but does not help the underlying condition , which can progress to acute heart failure			1
here the lungs are so filled with fluid the patient finds it difficult to breathe at all , and feels as though they are drowning			2
it is a life - threatening emergency which requires immediate hospital treatment — around 30 per cent of patients hospitalised after an episode of acute heart failure die within a year , making it more deadly than a heart attack			1
just ' relaxin ' : @entity64 is a man - made version of relaxin , which rises dramatically during pregnancy in order to reduce strain on the mother ¿ s heart the new treatment is based on relaxin — levels of this rise dramatically during pregnancy in order to reduce strain on the mother ’s heart			1
the amount of blood circulating in a woman ’s body increases by between 20 - 50 per cent in order to transport oxygen to the foetus via the placenta			2
scientists have discovered people with psoriasis are at raised risk of heart failure			1
a team at the @entity95 studied adults with and without psoriasis over 12 years and found those with the condition had almost double the incidence of heart failure			1
the risk went up as the severity of psoriasis increased			2
psoriasis causes scaly , inflamed patches and is caused by an overproduction of skin cells			2
‘ chronic inflammation is a characteristic of both psoriasis and heart failure and may play a significant role in their development , ’ said lead author dr @entity106 , a cardiologist from @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109			1
‘ psoriasis should be considered an inflammatory disease that affects the whole body , rather than an isolated skin lesion			0
‘ patients with psoriasis need education about the association between their skin condition and cardiovascular disease so that they can be sure to adopt heart - healthy behaviours			2
’ however , this means her heart needs to work 30 per cent harder			2
@entity130 helps by opening up the blood vessels and reducing blood pressure , taking excess strain off the heart ; relaxin also boosts kidney function , removing waste products from the blood			2
a six - month international study found that @entity11 reduced heart failure death rates by a third ( 37 per cent ) compared to conventional treatments such as @entity143 inhibitors			1
@entity11 appears to help the heart itself , unlike existing treatments which simply improve symptoms , says @entity148 , professor of cardiology at @entity150			1
he was not involved in the research but believes the new drug could mark ‘ a seismic shift ’ in the treatment of acute heart failure			1
‘ the current medications dampen the body ’s own responses to the heart not pumping properly ( such as increased blood pressure ) whereas @entity11 works in synch with the body , he says			1
‘ we are not entirely clear how it works but it helps take the load off the heart			2
it also helps prevent further damage to the heart and kidneys , and this translates into longer - term benefit			2
’ the drug , which was developed by @entity175 , is given in a drip for the first 48 hours after a patient is admitted with heart failure — when the risk of other organs failing is greatest , because of the poor blood supply			1
more studies are being conducted on the drug , which could be approved as early as next year			0
fighting cancer : black raspberry black raspberries might help prevent bowel cancer , suggest @entity188 researchers			0
the @entity190 berries are a more intensely flavoured variety and are rich in antioxidants ( disease - fighting compounds )			0
previous studies have suggested that eating black raspberries regularly could reduce the risks of bowel cancer			0
in a new study , the @entity197 tested the berries on mice with ulcerative colitis ( an inflammatory condition that ’s a possible precursor to bowel cancer )			0
one group of mice was fed black rasp - berries , another were put on a normal diet , and ulceration in the colon was measured ( an indicator of the risk of cancer )			0
the results found the berries prevented ulceration by blocking the signals that instruct healthy cells to become malignant			0
a decay detector has been designed to identify dental problems long before fillings are needed			0
the hand - held wand or probe - like device homes in on subtle changes in the mineral content of tooth enamel — these tiny changes , a sign that the tooth is being damaged by decay , can be detected by passing a mild electric current through the teeth			0
detection of decay at a very early stage is usually difficult			0
one problem is the widespread use of fluoride , which helps keep the enamel intact and apparently healthy , masking decay inside it			0
in a trial starting this month at the @entity241 , the device will be used on 200 children			0
a device that puffs medication into the nose has been developed to tackle low blood sugar levels — hypoglycaemia — in diabetes			0
this can occur if a patient takes too much insulin , misses a meal or after exercise , and causes drowsiness or loss of consciousness			0
prolonged , severe hypoglycaemia can led to brain damage and heart problems			2
sugary food or drink can reverse it ; in severe cases , the drug glucagon is injected to raise blood sugar			0
but this is available only as a powder that must be diluted , which is difficult during an attack			0
the new device , being tested on 70 patients at @entity272 and other @entity188 centres , speeds up the delivery , administering a powdered form of glucagon into the nostrils without the need to inhale			0
the trial is due to end next may .			0

@entity11 can cut the death rate for people with acute heart failure
around 900,000 people in the @entity18 suffer from heart failure
