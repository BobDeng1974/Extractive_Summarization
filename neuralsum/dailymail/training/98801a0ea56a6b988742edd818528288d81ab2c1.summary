by @entity0 published : 05:51 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 06:54 est , 19 october 2012 director @entity1 was arrested last november - and held in prison for three months without a trial or the option to post bail @entity6 film director @entity1 is suing the @entity7 after , he claims , he became ' lost ' in the prison system for three months - with no option to post bail and no legal recourse			1
the director was caught in what the @entity13 called a ' kafka-esque corner of @entity17 's immigration war ' , after his name was flagged up by the @entity19			1
despite having the means to post a £ 35,000 bail on an extortion charge , the director , whose best - known film is a semi-autobiographical account , ' @entity23 ' , instead became trapped in a vicious circle			1
the @entity7 would not accept bail until custom officers had cleared his records - but somehow @entity1 was lost in the system and a ' ice hold ' , which normally lasts 48 hours , was never lifted			1
@entity1 , who is recovering from testicular cancer , said he suffered a nervous breakdown during his 89 days inside			1
four other plaintiffs are making similar claims against the department , in a lawsuit being filed by the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) today			0
according to the @entity13 , @entity1 was arrested on november 15 in @entity40 on an extortion charge			1
he was in the country legally - but was identified as a suspected legal immigrant when his fingerprints were put through the system			1
when this occurs , all bail possibilities are held - which the @entity39 breaks a ' fundamental principle ' of justice			1
but for @entity1 , it was worse , for while a hold should be a straightforward procedure , it turned into a three - month nightmare from which there was ' no escape ' , it is claimed there are thousands of people who get trapped in similar situations - although the @entity39 says in its suit that the holds system may itself have been put on hold in the last week			1
incarcerated : @entity1 was kept at the @entity68 men 's @entity66 @entity1 's arrest followed issues with the foundations of his @entity68 property , after the director says he received a late - night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty , reducing the property 's value			1
further incidents led to @entity1 calling his ex-boyfriend and saying , as @entity1 tells the @entity13 : ' i said : " you 've conned me out of $ 500,000 , and why do n't you take the house back ? i 'll give you the house back for $ 500,000 - or i could just blog about what you 've done to me			1
' i threatened to blog about him			0
' the next day , @entity1 was called to the @entity84 for a meeting - and was arrested for extortion			1
while he believed his arrest was an over-reaction , instead he found himself on a ' never - ending @entity89 ' , spending the first night in cell with no blanket while his lawyers scrambled to release him			2
@entity1 , pictured in 2000 , made headlines in the 1980s when he re-invented himself as ' lord @entity94 ' but @entity1 's bondsman , @entity95 , said : ' the minute he got arrested , it was one weird incident after another			1
the jailer basically said , " we have an @entity19 hold , so we ca n't accept the bond			2
" there was just a runaround			0
' two days later at an arraignment , the judge set bail at $ 35,000 but was told about the @entity19 hold , and @entity1 was remanded to county custody			1
this was @entity111 's @entity110 - which @entity1 said was ' theatrically unpleasant			1
' you 're being shouted and screamed at			0
you 're not allowed to look anybody in the eye - you have to look at the floors at all times			2
it was an understandably barbaric situation			0
there he claims he was left for long periods without food , and was kept incarcerated except for a once - weekly trip to a roof			2
the rest of the time he spent in a small cell , awaiting news that never came , trapped in what the @entity39 calls a ' legal dead zone ' between the @entity19 and the @entity131 's office			0
@entity132 , of the @entity39 of @entity133 , said : ' a lot of time , when you talk to immigration about a person who is in custody , they say , " we ca n't do anything about it because the person 's not in our custody			2
' then you talk to the sheriff and they say , " we ca n't do anything about it			0
we did n't place the hold			2
" ' they keep pointing fingers at each other			0
' @entity1 , who says he is innocent of the charges , even debated pleading guilty after three months - during which @entity155 and @entity156 passed him by			1
finally , an fellow prisoner told @entity1 about the @entity159 , a @entity160 - based charity			1
he was able to make contact and : ' this woman literally turns up at the dorm , @entity164			0
and she 's wearing a bright pink suit			0
' she said : " my boss does n't usually take individual cases , but i think we can take yours			0
" ' they took my passport information to prove that i was here legally			0
' and 24 hours later he was free - because @entity174 knew ' exactly who to call at @entity19 '			2
when she explained the situation , the hold was lifted			0
@entity19 told @entity180 : ' because he had no prior criminal convictions and did not otherwise fall into @entity19 's enforcement priorities , the agency rescinded the immigration detainer and mr. @entity1 did not come into @entity19 custody			1
' @entity1 said : ' you are literally spat out of the jail			1
then they pull you through a door , and you 're outside			0
and it 's the weirdest feeling			0
i 'm on the street at 3 o'clock in the morning , waiting for the bail guy who 's going to take me home			0
' the @entity13 said that @entity1 ' still seems very much in shock , speaking in a calm , almost disembodied voice that suggests the toll has not sunk in '			2
he said : ' i still keep an eye on the roads in case a police car comes			0
i 'm terrified they 're going to take me back there			0
' ironically , the whole drama started when @entity1 prepared to sell his house for a move to @entity208			2
but , due to the charges , he now can not leave @entity17			0
but at least this time , his prison is a whole country and not a small @entity213 cell .			0

@entity1 , who filmed the 2002 film @entity23 , was arrested and held in @entity68 for three months without trial or chance to post bail
immigration authorities ' put a 48 - hour hold on director posting bail - and it lasted 89 days '
