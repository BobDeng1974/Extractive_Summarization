by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 09:25 est , 20 july 2012 an anti-olympics piece of graffiti in @entity3 shows the sentiment felt by people in the area			1
although they are looking forward to the 100metres businesses in the shadow of the @entity10 are enraged at what they call the betrayal of @entity14 's promises that @entity15 would boost the local community			1
one of the boasts of @entity14 's team was how local businesses would be helped by having the @entity19 on their doorsteps , yet dozens only a few hundred metres from the @entity10 now claim they are being deliberately denied the opportunity to cash - in			1
in what locals described as an ' extraordinary and shameful ' decision just days before the @entity27 , @entity3 , one of the railway stations closest to the @entity30 where tens of thousands of visitors are expected each day is to be closed , depriving businesses of potential customers			1
shops , restaurants and bars in the @entity38 area known for its artistic community have been gearing up for thousands of new customers investing money in advertising and pr for the @entity19 , as well as recruiting extra staff in anticipation of brisk trade			1
local businessman @entity47 , owner of the bar and cafe @entity50 , said : ' this decision is outrageous and flies in the face of what we were promised			2
' we were led to believe there would be an increase in trade and yet we are now effectively being cut off from any access at all			2
' it makes a mockery of the @entity19 bid as it was based on these promises			1
' many organisations moved to the area to specifically benefit from the @entity19 and they are astonished that only now have been told the key access to them is effectively being shut - off			1
@entity3 station is one stop from @entity67 , the main gateway to the @entity19 , and @entity69 and @entity70 , the owners of @entity72 , say westbound trains will not pick - up passengers from the station from 1pm each day			1
they contend the trains are likely to be packed full from @entity67 and would not be able to take on extra passengers at @entity3 where the platform for those travelling back to @entity80 would be full			1
with road closures and bus diversions affecting access to the area and parts of the river towpath , previously touted as an @entity19 route , shut down , one supermarket owner said : ' it is an absolute betrayal – we have built - up stocks for these weeks and now it will end - up costing us			1
' it seems a disgrace that only now are we being told of this decision , why was n't it made months ago so we could plan properly ? ' the @entity99 , a performance space approved by @entity101 , the very creation of which was to rejuvenate the areas closest to the @entity19 , is among those hit			1
@entity3 , one of the railway stations closest to the @entity30 , is to be closed to westbound trains , depriving businesses of potential customers producer @entity108 expects at ' a conservative estimate the loss of income of more than £ 20,000 over the two weeks , with many of our 12 staff being forced to take indeterminate unpaid leave			1
' department store chain @entity115 today said @entity19 fever helped drive a 17.3 per cent hike in sales as shoppers rushed to snap up @entity15 themed goods			1
the group notched up £ 70.3million in sales last week thanks to strong demand for @entity19 related sports clothing and homeware , while it also received a boost from the final week of clearance			1
@entity115 added that customers were hitting stores to pick up bargains as a form of " retail therapy " amid the ongoing poor summer weather			0
sales of @entity15 products meant a 39 per cent year - on - year surge in sportswear and spur an 8.9 per cent lift in home revenues in the week to july 14			0
fellow local business man @entity140 , joint md of a local film production company , has sympathy for businesses that rely on footfall : ' we were looking forward to there being a real buzz in the local community			1
some businesses actually moved here to capitalise on the @entity19 though it now seems that the opposite will happen			1
i ca n't see the logic in it and the reason for the decision has not been explained to us			0
' @entity157 , the @entity38 organising authority , have created much fanfare over the amount of work and income that the @entity19 will generate however it seems that for the independent businesses of @entity3 the opposite will be true , should this closure go ahead			1
resident and owner of @entity171 's @entity170 , @entity167 relies on the train service to meet clients , as well as having staff whose commute will be disrupted			0
but she also draws attention to the impact it will have on residents			0
many of her neighbours are elderly and they rely on the bus and train services to reach nearby amenities			0
' these people will be trapped , ' she said			0
' i really do n't know what they are going to do			0
many of these people are without the internet and can not walk more than short distances			0
their quality of life will be totally affected			0
' businesses have raised a petition and hope that transport chiefs will relent			2
many organisations moved to @entity3 to benefit from the @entity19 and have been left feeling betrayed that access to them is effectively being shut off @entity202 , chief operating officer of @entity203 , said : ' during the @entity19 , @entity38 will become a massive sporting and cultural venue , with up to one million extra visitors expected in the capital every day at @entity19 - time			1
' they will make an additional three million daily journeys , over and above the regular 12m journeys on public transport			0
' we and our operators have detailed crowd management plans in place for every station on the network , including @entity3 , which will enable us to deal safely with the exceptional increase in passenger numbers on @entity72			1
' those plans are based on the projected increase we expect around key stations serving the @entity19 venues and major @entity224			1
' shops are boarded up , the buildings look tatty and roads are littered with discarded mattresses , cupboards and wardrobes			0
welcome to the side of @entity67 , east @entity38 , that @entity19 organisers would rather you did n't see			1
@entity38 was awarded the @entity234 after the team behind the bid convinced officials that it would leave a lasting legacy for the regeneration of one of the capital 's poorest areas			0
but these grim pictures , taken only a stone 's throw from the @entity30 , reveal that more work is needed to turn around @entity67 's fortunes			0
discarded : mattresses and furniture line a pavement in @entity67 , where some residents are struggling to see how their area has benefited from the @entity19 @entity253 : a newsagent 's shop in @entity67 has its window boarded up damaging : this street has a view of the @entity10 , but a crashed car has been abandoned on the pavement almost £ 9.3billion has been spent on the @entity19 - with three - quarters of it earmarked for regeneration projects - but some residents say it is hard to see where the money has gone			1
the area has a new £ 1.45billion shopping mall , @entity268 , which has created 10,000 jobs and brought new waves of shoppers			2
the athletes ' village is believed to have cost about £ 1.1billion to build , although it was sold to @entity275 developers last year for only £ 557million			2
but critics fear other parts of @entity67 have been forgotten			0
@entity279 , of the @entity280 , a pressure group set up to hold @entity15 officials to account , said : ' you look at the old @entity283 and it is dwarfed by the new glistening @entity268			0
' @entity268 is a stark contrast to the town centre that 's for sure			0
they have placed some turquoise sculptures in @entity67 , but that 's about it			0
' the @entity19 ' @entity289 ' statue overlooks a building in need of refurbishment closed : a statue on the @entity30 stands behind businesses with their shutters down the dour exterior of the old shopping centre is a world away form the bright @entity268 complex			1
and the town 's high street is peppered with shut - down shops and closing down sales			0
mr @entity279 said : ' you could argue that there is no need to spruce it up because i doubt many visitors to the @entity19 will ever bother to venture outside the @entity30			2
' they will just get the tube or train straight to @entity67 and turn left into the @entity19 complex			2
' it 's questionable what tarting up the area would actually do for the fortunes of the businesses			2
they will just be inconvenienced by the games			0
' shopkeeper @entity319 , who runs a newsagent business in the @entity283 opposite @entity268 , said : ' money needs to be invested in the @entity283 , not just the @entity30			0
a bed shop is closed with shutters drawn down in @entity67 town centre ' it does n't impact locals if not			2
how are we meant to compete ? ' the least the council could do is lower our rates so we can be more competitive because business has been affected badly			0
' residents said the changes they had seen so far were cosmetic			0
@entity333 said : ' i 'm glad @entity268 is there , it 's a great local facility for the people of @entity67 but you ca n't help feel it was created more for people from outside to come in , shop and leave without really entering the real @entity67			2
' it has been given its own district - @entity342 - and that helps create this idea that it is a separate from the town			0
' i do n't think the regeneration and tidying up that 's happened before the @entity19 has really had much impact on the wider @entity67 area			2

@entity3 railway station will be closed to westbound trains
local businesses *suggest* they will lose out on £ 20,000 of trade as a result
organisations say they moved there to take advantage of @entity19
