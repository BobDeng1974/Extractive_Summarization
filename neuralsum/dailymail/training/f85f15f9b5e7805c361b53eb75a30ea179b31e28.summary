they were mocked as ' jackasses ' for revealing how they had been ' exiled ' from the @entity3 - to @entity5 's most exclusive resort			1
now the @entity8 - born @entity7 socialites refused re-entry to the @entity3 , after being accused of ' enslaving ' their @entity8 nanny , have broken their silence to @entity12 - to say that it is ' heart - breaking ' spending @entity14 in @entity15			1
@entity16 and her husband @entity17 were formally cleared of trafficking their child - minder to the @entity3 and forcing her to work in slave - like conditions			1
but during a family sailing holiday around the @entity23 , their visas were rescinded - and the family have been stuck in @entity15 on the @entity5 @entity25 ever since			1
now as they face @entity14 away from their @entity28 home and an ongoing legal tussle , mother - of - four @entity16 has told @entity32 of her despair after being denied entry to the country where she grew up			1
stranded : socialites @entity16 , 29 , left , and @entity17 , 35 , right , are not allowed to return to @entity7 from @entity5 despite being cleared of abusing their nanny ' distress ' : the couple and their four children are stuck in @entity15 , north @entity5 the 30 - year - old said it was ' heart - breaking ' for the couple to tell the children they were n't going to get home for the holidays			1
she said : ' my eldest son asked for no presents for @entity14			1
instead he made a card saying all he wanted for @entity14 was to go back to @entity7 , as a family			1
' the couple 's elder children @entity57 , @entity16 and @entity58 , have now missed the first semester of the school year and the @entity61 have been forced to enroll them in an @entity5 school ' to distract them ' and ' give them some normality in their lives '			1
@entity16 , who was born in @entity8 into a prominent family , grew up in @entity7 until , at the age of 19 , she fell pregnant with @entity57 and moved with @entity17 to her native country			1
but after she gained a place at the prestigious @entity70 in 2011 the family relocated to the @entity71 's @entity28			1
@entity17 and the three elder children had permission to live there because of @entity16 's student visa while their youngest was born in the @entity3 and is a @entity3 citizen			1
the family were accompanied by a nanny , @entity78 , whom they had hired through an agency in @entity8			1
but with three months she had left			0
two years later she accused the couple of taking her passport , locking her in their apartment , not giving her enough food while they dined out at @entity71 's trendiest restaurants and allowing their children to beat her			1
the @entity61 denied the charges but were ordered to pay around $ 6,000 in backpay			0
in the surrounding publicity a series of unpleasant emails between @entity17 and a photographer who had worked with him emerged , creating the impression of an over-privileged snob			2
in one email @entity17 allegedly tormented his former collaborator with the fact that he was the great - grandson of a seamstress			1
' if you were reborn a million times your grandmother would never be a baroness like mine			0
' @entity17 claims his grandmother was born an aristocrat in @entity108 , although his exact lineage is unclear			2
' abuse ' : @entity16 claims the pair have been receiving hate mail in the wake of the dismissed lawsuit but @entity16 insists their home life in @entity7 was ' very simple ' and says she and her husband divided the chores and had no any help around the house after the nanny left			1
this summer as the case dragged on and with the stress of proving their innocence weighing on them the couple accepted an invitation to stay on a friend 's boat sailing along the @entity132 and @entity5 coast			1
since @entity16 had n't left the @entity3 for two years , their visas had expired , but she believed renewing them was a formality and she claims she had all the paper work in order			2
the lawsuit was not yet resolved but as it was a civil suit it should n't have had any bearing on the decision , @entity16 says			2
but when she went to pick up the passports the first thing they did was stamp them with denials as she looked on in horror			0
on a peninsula in the @entity151 , @entity15 is @entity5 's most exclusive and glamorous resort			1
it is where @entity153 and @entity154 romanced in the 1961 as she took a break from filming @entity157 , and its main hotel , the @entity160 , offers stunning views , lavish fine dining and the chance to bump into a-list guests			0
the resort itself has hosted everyone from @entity168 to @entity169 , drawn by its scenery and climate			0
@entity14 is low season but it compares favorably to @entity7 for climate			1
today it is mostly sunny and @entity174 - compared to a rainy @entity71 where the temperature is @entity176 the officials would not explain the problem but gave her a code that corresponded to the stated reason for refusal			1
it was only afterwards that she discovered the visa was refused on grounds of the ' human trafficking ' claims made against her by the nanny			2
she remembered : ' i was in a complete state of shock			0
i lived in the @entity3 from the age of one until i was 19			0
never could i have imagined that this would happen			0
i felt like i had been judged without having been found guilty			0
' she said it ' broke her heart ' to tell the family			2
' one more way the lawsuit ruined our lives			2
' things went from bad to worse			0
within 24 hours of the decision her husband was hospitalized and operated on for a collapsed lung			0
@entity16 describes this time as ' the most difficult experience of our lives '			0
but after two weeks @entity17 was allowed to go ' home ' , which was by then , a friend 's house , a former chapel near @entity15			1
and on december 9 they were officially cleared of all charges brought by the nanny			1
' we cried tears of joy and relief ' she said			0
however it will be impossible to forget the ' suffering we went through because of all the lies , ' she said			0
but the ramifications of the lawsuit that ' ruined our lives ' are still with them as they have not so far been granted permission for a reconsideration of their immigration ban			0
' all those false allegations were deemed baseless and thrown out of court ... it was all a lie , but the repercussions of this lawsuit seem endless , ' she said			0
with @entity14 here it is particularly tough			2
' the children miss their friends , their toys , belongings			0
' the @entity61 will be having a ' simple ' family @entity14 she said			2
' we will give the children their gifts , we will go to mass in family			2
we will continue to pray that this wrong be righted			0
friends and family can not believe the injustice , she said			0
' it makes no sense to anyone looking from the outside in			0
well , it does n't make sense to us either and we are living it			0
' ' we want to leave all this nightmare behind us , and get back to @entity7 , where we have a right to be , adding , ' our bags are packed			2
we are ready to go			0
