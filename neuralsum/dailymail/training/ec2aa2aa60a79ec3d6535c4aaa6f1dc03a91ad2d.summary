by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 10 september 2012 @entity1 has been careful to set herself apart from the typical celebrity designer , and this morning it seemed that her efforts had paid off			0
a front row that included @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , as well as proud husband , @entity9 , broke out into rapturous applause as she took her bow at the end			1
clearly delighted by the reaction , mrs @entity1 is seen holding her hands to her face in surprise , before returning backstage			0
stunned : a thrilled @entity1 could not believe the rapturous applause as she took her bow at the end of her @entity18 show this morning take a bow : the designer wore a black minidress from the collection with the same towering peeop - toe shoe - boots worn by her models the latest in a string of critically - acclaimed collections , mrs @entity1 continued the sharp schoolgirl theme that has been filtering into her collections lately			1
@entity29 pointed collars and cropped jackets were new for the label , and a welcome addition to her repertoire of fitted dresses			1
pleated white tennis skirts and racer - back tanks had a sporty feel , heightened by the styling which teamed them with flat brogues and boots			0
a delicate lattice pattern was a key detail ; it appeared on dresses and tops on cutaway sections , as well as handbags and clutches			0
commenting on the line , @entity51 , pr director at @entity52 said : ' it was good i see her move to separates - there was almost a @entity58 feel to some of the pieces such as the box skirts and cropped jackets			0
' but there was a relaxed feel to the collection			0
i liked it , it 's good to see her confidence growing with each collection			2
' done and dusted ! mrs @entity1 tweeted this picture of herself along with the caption : ' relieved ! ! ! ca n't believe it 's over			0
thank you # vbteam ! ! ! ' proud supporter : mrs @entity1 's husband @entity9 takes his seat on the front row ahead of her show in the thick of it : @entity81 sat front row at his wife 's show there were also more famous names in the front row than past seasons			1
as well as @entity6 and mr @entity81 , who also attended the last show , @entity89 's @entity8 was present this time ( clad in @entity1 , of course )			1
and tennis player @entity7 wore hot pink trousers to take her seat in prime position next to ms @entity6			1
the designer herself wore a black minidress from the collection with the same towering peep - toe shoe - boots worn by her models			2
the dress that mrs @entity1 was wearing appeared as one of the looks in the show ( left )			0
a shot of orange - red was the only concession to colour ( centre ) jackets , shirts and skirts were mrs @entity1 's first major foray into separates new themes : flippy tiered tennis skirts ( left ) and that lattice pattern on the front of a collared dress ( right ) the lattice pattern appeared on a clutch bag too ( left )			1
and instead of mrs @entity1 's favourite towering heels many models wore flat brogues and boots leading lights : @entity6 beamed as she took in the shows , as did @entity9 at a later event where he did n't have to stress for his wife			2

crisp shirts and sharp , pointed collars were a *highlight* of the designer 's collection for *spring* / *summer* 2013
