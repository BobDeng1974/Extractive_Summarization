by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 08:15 est , 15 october 2013 a farmer has created purple , green and orange varieties of cauliflower in a bid to get more people eating vegetables			1
the ' rainbow ' caulis are part of @entity12 ' plan to improve the diets of people across the country by making the vegetables more appetising			1
the 48 - year - old has set aside a small patch of land in @entity20 to grow his experimental vegetables - which took him years to develop			1
bright idea : farmer @entity12 has created three colourful varieties of cauliflower - called grafitti , top , @entity26 , left , and @entity27 , right - in a bid to get more people eating vegetables the weird and wonderful creations , which are all organic , are made by cross-breeding ancient varieties			1
all of the hybrids were hand - pollinated by mr @entity12 , who farms 15,000 acres in total			1
as well as brightening up everyday dishes , the colourful vegetables are also healthier than regular cauliflowers			1
the purple variety , called grafitti , is packed with antioxidants while the orange ones , called @entity26 , contain carotene - a form of vitamin a that encourages healthy skin			1
the green variety , @entity27 , is a hybrid cauliflower with similar features to broccoli and so is high in vitamin c and fibre			0
mr @entity12 , who is director of agriculture for his family business @entity53 , said : ' we started off growing the coloured cauliflowers for show			1
' the purple and the green varieties tasted just like normal cauliflower but then we found the orange ones had a really nutty flavour			2
long process : the organic vegetables are created by cross-breeding ancient varieties and were all hand - pollinated by the farmer - who said the colourful varieties took years to develop ' we created the colours by cross-breeding			1
we pick out the various traits we want , then hybridise the variety to make sure they are stable			0
' it takes a long time to develop different varieties though - some can take up to five years to get right			1
' the cauliflowers are grown over half a dozen plots in the test field , which works out about a quarter of an acre			0
' next year i will step up the orange cauliflowers with the hope that they could be on supermarket shelves in the near future			0
' one idea we had was to sell the caulis ready floreted , perhaps as a mixed colour bag			0
unusual : the purple @entity89 , pictured , is packed with antioxidants weird and wonderful : the green variety , @entity27 , left , is similar to broccoli and is high in vitamin @entity93 the orange variety , called @entity96 , right , is nutty in flavour and contains carotene that encourages healthy skin			1
' there are health and taste benefits but also it 's about making food a bit more fun			0
' growing is a passion for me			0
i enjoy my job so much it is more like a hobby - i love to discover new things			0
' every other year i take a trip to a different part of the world in search of new ideas and new varieties			0
the cauliflower is a member of the brassica oleracea species - which also includes broccoli , cabbage , brussels sprouts and kale			0
there are hundreds of varieties of cauliflower - which is grown around the world			2
the unusual vegetables were originally developed for show , but mr @entity12 soon realised they could be produced on a mass scale			1
the colours are created by cross-breeding			0
the farmer would pick out a desired trait in a variety and would then breed that with another to create a hybrid product			2
although it sounds reasonably straight forward , it can take a long time to develop - with the farmer saying it can take up to five years to get right			2
mr @entity12 grows the cauliflowers over half a dozen plots in a test field , which works out about a quarter of an acre			1
he hopes the orange variety - with its distinct nutty taste - will be in supermarkets within the year			2
' if i see something i like that i think might work i bring it home and experiement with it in the trial field - it 's like my playground			2
' if i think we can grow it successfully we will try maybe an acre and if that goes well we will scale it up			0
' the idea behind the trial field is to change people 's perceptions of vegetables			2
' if we ate a healthier diet with more vegetables we could save the country millions of pounds but we have to convince people to do that			2
' our ultimate goal is to try to create healthy , appealing vegetables that people want eat more of			1
' the cauliflower is a member of the brassica oleracea species which also includes broccoli , cabbage , brussels sprouts and kale			0
there are hundreds of varieties of cauliflower being grown around the world			0
the vegetable is known for being low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamin c and dietery fibre			0
the @entity191 ' farming business produces 500,000 tonnes of vegetables each year and employs 1,000 staff			0
mr @entity12 is the latest in a long line of farmers in the family , who started growing vegetables in 1898			1
the @entity53 company boomed in the years following the @entity199 as the nation emerged from rationing			0
on the shelves : mr @entity12 , pictured on his farm in @entity20 , hopes the orange variety will be stocked in supermarkets within the year			1

' @entity207 ' hand - pollinated in @entity20 field by cross-breeding ancient varieties - a process than can take years to *perfect*
as well as brightening up bland meals , the varieties are packed with antioxidants and vitamins so are healthier than regular type , farmer says
farmer @entity12 hopes creations will get people eating vegetables
