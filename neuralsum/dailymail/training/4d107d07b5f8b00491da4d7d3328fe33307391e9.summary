@entity1 defender @entity0 has warned @entity2 not to take anything for granted as they attempt to succeed where @entity6 leaders @entity4 failed			1
@entity9 's men left the @entity10 with a 0 - 0 draw - the first time they have failed to score this season - on saturday evening as the @entity13 turned in a stubborn defensive display and might even have snatched victory in a late flurry of activity			1
@entity2 will follow in their footsteps on wednesday night when they head for @entity19 desperate to end a run of four successive 1 - 0 league defeats on @entity19 , although @entity0 is looking for more of the same			1
@entity1 defender managed to keep @entity4 striker @entity23 quiet at the @entity10 @entity23 of @entity4 ( right ) catches @entity1 's @entity0 with an arm while battling for a header asked if @entity1 could extend their remarkable run , the former @entity27 defender said : ' after this result , there 's always a possibility			2
' every game , we go into the game looking to win it and if we show the same commitment again , i 'm sure we 'll have chances			0
' if you ask any player which teams they want to play , they 'd say the top four or five			0
i suppose you would be up for it a little bit more and wanting to do really well			0
' everyone is watching and why not play well against the best teams ? ' @entity23 's arm connects with the face of @entity1 during a challenge in the air @entity4 arrived in the north east six points clear at the top of the league after a 19 - game unbeaten start to the campaign and determined not to allow their hosts a third win on the trot over them inside 12 months			1
they enjoyed the greater share of the possession , but were rarely able to break through a red and white wall , and although @entity68 struck a post with a 17th - minute shot , @entity13 defender @entity64 was later denied by the crossbar			2
@entity9 , who saw striker @entity23 pick up just a single yellow card - his fifth of the season , which means he will miss wednesday game against @entity78 - after clashes with central defenders @entity80 and @entity0 , was complimentary about @entity1 's defensive resilience and insisted he had nothing for which to reproach his players			2
@entity4 defender @entity85 ( left ) challenges @entity1 defender @entity80 in the air on saturday evening @entity0 said : ' we made it very difficult			1
i thought @entity91 [ midfielder @entity90 ] was tremendous , like most of the lads , and that gave us a good balance and we showed them they were not going to have it all their own way			0
we went in at half - time 0 - 0 and in the second half , anything can happen			2
there were a few tired legs , and they had some good chances as well - not perfect chances , but they had a couple of half - chances and then at the end , we probably could have nicked it as well			0
' at the beginning of the game , you would have said it would have been a great point earned , but we battled all the way through and then we had a couple of half - chances at the end			0
@entity118 celebrates @entity2 's second at @entity120 during the 3 - 0 win on the south coast @entity90 robs @entity123 of possession during the 0 - 0 draw against @entity4 on saturday ' we are happy with the result			1
we maybe could have nicked it , but it was a good @entity4 team and we put everything in and managed to stop them scoring and get the draw			0
' that draw means @entity1 are now unbeaten in four games since their season took an alarming dip with an 8 - 0 defeat at @entity120 and @entity138 's 2 - 0 victory on @entity19 , although @entity0 insists engineering the transformation has not been complicated			1
he said : ' if anything , it 's just back to basics , doing everything right , not necessarily making it difficult for ourselves , playing simple football , but in a quick way and defending how we know we can defend , where we make it very difficult for teams to score			0
