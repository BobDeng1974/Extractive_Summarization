but some users do n't think that is enough thanks and they want a cut of the money but the social network in @entity29 , @entity30 , is now facing a backlash from some of its 845million users , some of whom are unhappy that so much money is being made from the information and photos they posted for free			1
and they wo n't see a cent of it			0
along with that criticism , the relatively care - free days of ‘ hypergrowth ’ may be behind @entity1 , as the firm begins the difficult task of living up to @entity49 's lofty expectations under the new , public microscope , analysts say			1
at a valuation of $ 100billion , @entity1 is worth $ 118 per user			1

‘ so , everyone , message the high " z " for your minimum one share			2
’ and there may be bigger riches to come for the company and the thousands of employees who hold equity in the company			0
@entity1 's advertising business has room for growth			1
in 2011 , the number of ads delivered on the website rose 42 per cent year on year , while the average price per ad delivered rose 18 per cent			0
the wealth of information that users give @entity1 - from their age , gender and city of residence to the music and products that they ‘ like ’ - means that the company can easily do targeted marketing			1
hugely - popular : social network @entity1 is now facing a backlash from its 845million users , unhappy it 's making so much money from their content , details and photos they posted for free @entity137 joked that he was considering making a ‘ @entity139 ’ website			1

it 's time to get paid ' @entity137 , user ‘ for the valuation that people are going to be paying for this name , they 're going to probably be overpaying by a third because of the optimism related to just the name , ’ @entity157 said			2
mr @entity157 , the chief executive of @entity30 - based wealth management firm @entity164 , added : ‘ the numbers justify maybe a $ 50billion ( valuation ) number			0
’ @entity1 's revenue growth rate - roughly 88 per cent in 2011 - would justify a $ 65billion valuation , which is far short of the $ 100billion that sources have said the company is looking for , he said			1
no doubt some disgruntled users would take their share of that lower valuation figure			2
