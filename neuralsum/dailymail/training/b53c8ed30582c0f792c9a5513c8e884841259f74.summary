the prime minister voiced his opposition last week to the prospect of @entity3 being appointed to the role , warning it would enrage @entity18 voters across @entity19			1
yesterday it emerged that he had gone further in private , reportedly telling @entity5 chancellor @entity4 it could lead to @entity7 ’s departure from the @entity8			1
mr @entity3 , a former prime minister of @entity24 , is a veteran enthusiast for the creation of a ‘ @entity26 ’			1
mr @entity1 believes handing him the controls in @entity28 would send a provocative message to the millions across @entity19 who voted for @entity18 parties in last month ’s @entity8 parliamentary elections			2
the respected @entity5 magazine @entity33 said that in private talks with mrs @entity4 , the prime minister branded mr @entity3 a ‘ face from the 1980s ’ who ‘ can not solve the problems of the next five years ’			1
he is said to have warned that the selection of mr @entity3 ‘ would destabilise his government to such an extent that the referendum would have to be brought forward and will be likely to lead to the @entity7 voting no to @entity8 membership ’			1
@entity47 sources did not dispute mr @entity1 ’s reported attack on mr @entity3 last night			1
however , one insisted he was making a broader statement about ‘ stability in the @entity8 ’ rather than the @entity52			0
the source insisted there was no threat to bring forward the planned referendum on @entity8 membership from 2017			0
mrs @entity4 with mr @entity3 : @entity5 magazine @entity33 said that in private talks with mrs @entity4 , mr @entity1 branded mr @entity3 a ' face from the 1980s ' who ' can not solve the problems of the next five years ' mr @entity1 ’s reported remarks angered mr @entity3 , who has the backing of the @entity65 , the centre - right group in the @entity61 that includes mrs @entity4 ’s meps			1
@entity66 will launch a staunch defence of the @entity8 today , amid speculation that he will make a fresh bid to be president of @entity19			0
the former prime minister will use a speech to the @entity73 in @entity74 to underline his pro-eu credentials – just days after private talks with @entity5 leader @entity4 in which he reportedly offered to tour @entity19 with the message ‘ being in the @entity8 is good for you ’			1
however his office strenuously denied he is after the top job , saying that he ‘ is not seeking any role ’			0
mr @entity3 called on @entity8 leaders not to bow to ‘ minority ’ pressure , telling @entity5 ’s @entity87 newspaper : ‘ @entity19 must not allow itself to be blackmailed			1
’ he said he was ‘ optimistic about being chosen as the next commission president by mid-july ’			0
@entity7 sources believe it may eventually be possible to persuade @entity8 leaders to back a more reform - minded candidate , not least because @entity93 is also unenthusiastic about mr @entity3			1
the post is one of the most powerful in @entity28 as the commission has the power to draw up legislation , and will play a key role in mr @entity1 ’s attempt to renegotiate @entity7 ’s relationship with the @entity8			2

married to former @entity122 leader @entity121 ’s son @entity120 , she would probably get mr @entity1 ’s support			2
also in the running is @entity125 , 58 , the @entity93 head of the @entity126 , a conservative and friend of @entity128			0
as a former finance minister to @entity130 , however , she is unlikely to win the backing of @entity93 ’s socialist president @entity132			0
an outside choice is @entity134 , 58 , the president of @entity135 , who has served as an @entity8 budget commissioner			0
