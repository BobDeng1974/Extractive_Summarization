by @entity0 published : 09:58 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 13:14 est , 18 september 2013 president @entity1 is facing widespread backlash for his decision to deliver a speech touting his fiscal policies on monday while three miles away , @entity6 was under siege by a gunman who slaughtered 12 people in @entity10 's deadliest day since september 11 , 2001			1
the move was baffling to @entity1 's critics and supporters alike			1
in the midst of the confusion and bloodshed that unfolded monday , tv networks cut away from the drama to hear @entity1 address the massacre only briefly before quickly pivoting to an attack on @entity21 in @entity22			1
@entity24 columnist @entity23 blasted @entity1 's decision in a piece published wednesday			1
in this photo taken monday , september 16 , 2013 , president @entity1 pauses as he speaks in the @entity29 on the @entity31 complex in @entity10 ' he could have posted his original remarks on the @entity31 web site and replaced them with a @entity35 on gun control , or comfort for the shaken city , ' she wrote			1
' the 12 who died were , after all , under his aegis as workers in a federal building			0
' ' but , jarringly , the president went ahead with his political attack , briefly addressing the slaughter before moving on to jab @entity21 over the corporate tax rate and resistance to @entity48			2
' calling the move ' out of joint , ' @entity23 declared : ' the man who connected so electrically and facilely in 2008 , causing @entity52 to overlook his thin résumé , can not seem to connect anymore			2
' @entity56 's ' @entity55 ' host @entity54 offered an even more scathing review			1
' on the day while people were hiding , while people were bleeding , while people were dying , while the nation was locked in on this - he ’s talking about harsh partisanship and @entity21 wanting to hurt people , ' @entity54 said of @entity1			1
frantic search : emergency responders arrive at the @entity6 in @entity10 , where 12 people were killed and eight injured on monday one of @entity69 ' victims was @entity70 and a candlelight vigil was held in his honor at @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 on tuesday ' what is more partisan than not being able to put aside one of these stupid @entity10 battles - [ postponing it ] for a day ? @entity80 came under consideration			1
there ’s not one person in the @entity31 that said , " you know right down the block , people are dying right now and there ’s a gunman on the loose and there ’s local schools shutdown			2
the @entity92 is on shutdown			0
and there may be a second or third gunman			0
and you know what ? maybe we ’ll just give this speech tomorrow			0
" ' @entity21 lawmakers have also been quick to attack @entity1 , with @entity31 speaker @entity101 calling his speech a ' shame			2
' former house speaker and 2012 @entity21 presidential candidate @entity104 also weighed in , saying , ' president @entity1 should have recognized that an event this painful and tragic , in the nation 's capital , required being president rather than partisan , and being concerned about people rather than concerned about attacking			1
' vigil for the victims : @entity111 , who became step dad to @entity113 when he was eight years old , said he did not see any initial signs of @entity115 in @entity69 after 9/11 chaos : more than 3,000 people work at the site in @entity10 where gunfire erupted on monday feeling the need to jump to his own defense , @entity1 on tuesday tried to explain his remarks			1
he told @entity124 in an interview to ' keep in mind ' that he delivered the remarks ' while we were still gathering information ' about the shooting			1
' i think that everybody understands that the minute something like this happens , i 'm in touch with the @entity136 , i 'm in touch with my national security team , we 're making sure that all the assets are out there for us to deal with this as well as we can , ' he continued			0
' what is also important to remember is that @entity22 has a lot of work to do right now			0
' @entity31 press secretary @entity145 also sought to defend the president 's actions , saying tuesday that @entity21 are ' trying to make something ' out of nothing			2
escape : employees at the naval yard run from the building with their hands in the air following the shooting traumatized from pulling bodies from the mangled wreckage on 9/11 , @entity69 did n't sleep for days afterwards and later developed @entity115 - possibly as a result of what he saw at ground zero ' the president spoke about the @entity6 at the very top of his briefing , ' he said			1
' he talked about the cowardly act that had taken place , the tragedy that was unfolding and the loss of life and he called for and demanded a seamless investigation with federal and local law enforcement officials and that is what we 're seeing now			0
' but a brief statement at the top of his remarks just was n't enough in light of the tragedy at hand , a @entity176 consultant told @entity183			0
the speech was ' suprisingly tone - deaf , ' the consultant said , speaking anonymously			0
' national unity has been at the heart of the @entity1 brand since his 2004 " there are no red states and no blue states " speech			2
to pass up a chance to unite the country after a tragedy was a missed opportunity			0
unhelpful in terms of politics			0
even more unhelpful in terms of governance			0
