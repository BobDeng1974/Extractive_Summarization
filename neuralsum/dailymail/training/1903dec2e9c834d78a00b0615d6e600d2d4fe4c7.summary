by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 11:47 est , 26 july 2013 a @entity2 man who lost his arm in a motorcycle accident has built his own prosthesis after finding out he was to become a father			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , built an ingenious robotic arm that allows him to perform a series of useful tasks and resume his career as an electronics technician to provide for his family			1
a doctor had advised mr @entity7 to accept his disability , but he instead built his own prosthesis to carry on with this old life and win a prize for science , technology and innovation			1
mr @entity7 was rushed to the emergency room , but doctors had to amputate his left arm from the shoulder			0
he also suffered severe internal organ damage and fractured legs			0
the amputation operation was particularly traumatic as it was clear that the electronics technician , who worked for a computer part manufacturer , would not be able to continue doing his job with one arm			0
@entity7 's arm has a clamp for holding objects so that he can grip electronic items in need of repair , as well as a magnifying glass and lighting so he can repair fiddly components more easily and earn a living while an orthopedist told mr @entity7 that he should come to terms with his disability and move on with life in a new way , he had other ideas			2
when lying in intensive care recovering from his injuries , mr @entity7 learned he would soon become a father , which made him determined to provide for his new family			0
just three months after his accident , mr @entity7 designed a prosthetic arm that would allow him to repair electrical components and earn a living as he did before			0
he created his robotic arm with the help of his orthopedist uncle , @entity71 , who provided the essential parts to build the prosthesis			0
mr @entity7 used his electronics expertise to ensure the arm performed the functions he needed to allow him to resume his job without anyone else 's help			2
@entity7 , from @entity8 , built an ingenious robotic arm that allows him to perform a series of useful tasks and resume his career as an electronics technician to provide for his family although the arm looks rather basic , it has a number of switches and sensors that allow mr @entity7 to control it with the movement around his collarbone			1
it also has a clamp for holding objects so that he can grip electronic items in need of repair , as well as a magnifying glass and lighting so he can fix fiddly components more easily			0
before his accident , mr @entity7 used to mend six mobile phones every day			1
with the help of his new prostheses , he can fix four , but plans on upgrading his arm to help boost his productivity			0
mr @entity7 's home made robotic arm cost between 2,000 and 5,000 bolivars - between £ 200 and £ 500 because it was largely built from domestic materials			1
he said : ' i ’m doing this kind of prosthesis for me , but if one day someone wants me to make one for them , i can do it with my eyes closed and adapt it to the way they live and work			0
' the robotic arm is powered by a small motor connected to a battery and has sensors connected to mr @entity7 's collarbone to detect movements mr @entity7 also intends to build a more efficient wheelchair to donate to a child who needs it			1
the robotic arm is powered by a small motor connected to a battery , and has sensors connected to mr @entity7 's collarbone to detect movements			1
the duo 's focus was on functionality , not aesthetics , but mr @entity7 already has plans to develop a new prosthesis that looks more like a natural arm			2
he also intends to replace the small motor with a servomotor that will allow him to control his arm faster and with more precision			2
a prosthesis costs 90,000 bolivars in @entity147 , which is equivalent to approximately £ 9,500 - an amount that is too much for many people to afford			0
his focus was on functionality , not aesthetics , but mr @entity7 already has plans to develop a new prosthesis that looks more like a natural arm and will react faster and with more precision to his movements			1

@entity7 built his own arm , which has a number of switches and sensors that allow him to control it with the movement around his collarbone
the electrician started work on the device after he was told he was to become a father , so he could carry on with his job of fixing mobile phones
he is now working on a more aesthetically - *pleasing* arm using servomotors to allow him to control his prosthesis faster and with more precision
