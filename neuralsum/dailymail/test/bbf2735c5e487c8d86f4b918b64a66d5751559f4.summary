a laser could be mounted on the @entity1 and used to shoot down pieces of space debris in @entity5 orbit , says a new paper			1
the system would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles ( 100km ) away			1
powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into @entity5 ’s atmosphere , where it would burn up			1
@entity17 researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the iss. it would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in @entity5 orbit ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
the system would have a range of 62 miles ( 100km ) and could target things less than 0.4 inches ( 1cm ) in size the paper , by researchers at the @entity30 research institute in @entity17 , was published in @entity31			1
their system would use the @entity34 ’s ( @entity34 ) super-wide - field telescope on @entity37 ’s @entity36 on the @entity1 the laser , meanwhile , use bundles of optical fibres to produce powerful laser pulses - capable of both high power and high frequency , although exact figures were not given			1
since the first object , @entity47 1 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris			0
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			0
one major source of debris in the past was a @entity70 anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere			2
accidental events have also contributed to the problem			0
in 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a @entity80 communications satellite and a defunct @entity82 military probe over @entity83			0
combining these two instruments would create a system that could deorbit space debris down to the size of 0.4 inches ( one centimetre )			2
the impact of the laser beam on debris would create a force that reduced its velocity , causing it to fall into @entity5 ’s atmosphere and burn up			1
the group plans to deploy a small proof - of - concept experiment on the @entity1 , with a small , eight - inch ( 20 - centimetre ) version of the @entity34 telescope and a laser with 100 fibres			2
‘ if that goes well , we plan to install a full - scale version on the @entity1 , incorporating a three - meter [ 10ft ] telescope and a laser with 10,000 fibres , giving it the ability to deorbit debris with a range of approximately 100 kilometers [ 62 miles ] , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity100			1
looking further into the future , the team said they could have a ‘ free - flyer ’ mission not attached to @entity1 in another orbit to shoot down debris			1
for example , such a system could be deployed in polar orbit at an altitude of about 500 miles ( 800km ) , ‘ where the greatest concentration of debris is found , ’ according to dr @entity100			2
without going into specifics , the team says their proposal could remove ‘ most ’ of the centimetre - sized debris in @entity5 orbit within five years of operation			1
@entity125 has asked the researchers to explain how often the laser would fire , and what its maximum capacity in terms of debris - size to deorbit would be			1
the technology bears some similarities to the @entity134 - shown - used to devastating effect in the original star wars trilogy			0
without going into specifics , the team says their proposal could remove ‘ most ’ of the centimetre - sized debris in @entity5 orbit within five years of operation the paper , by researchers at the @entity30 research institute in @entity17 , was published in @entity31			1
their system would use the @entity34 ’s ( @entity34 ) super-wide - field telescope on @entity37 ’s @entity36 on the @entity1 ( shown ) the @entity34 telescope was originally planned to detect ultraviolet light from air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays			2
but the researchers realised they could put it to another use - the removal of space debris			2
the fibre - powered laser , meanwhile , was originally developed to power particle accelerators - but again another use for it was found			0
space debris , which is continuously accumulating as a result of human space activities , consists of artificial objects orbiting the earth			0
the number of objects nearly doubled from 2000 to 2014 and they have become a major obstacle to space development			0
the total mass of space debris is calculated to be about 3,000 tons			0
it consists of derelict satellites , rocket bodies and parts , and small fragments produced by collisions between debris			0
‘ we may finally have a way to stop the headache of rapidly growing space debris that endangers space activities , ’ added dr @entity100 .			0

@entity17 researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the @entity1
it would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in @entity5 orbit
would have a range of 100km and could target things less than 1cm in size
the team says their proposal could remove ' most ' of the debris in orbit
