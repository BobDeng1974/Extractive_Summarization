a pill to combat obesity is a step closer today after scientists discovered cells that transform ' bad ' fat to ' good '			2
the cells , known as @entity7 , are involved in converting white fat , which causes people to put on weight , into brown fat , which helps burn excess energy			1
the @entity14 researchers believe that by targeting the body 's metabolic pathways , where these cells work , could help combat obesity			0
they said the breakthrough could lead to a new way of treating obesity - related diseases			0
scientists at the @entity23 in @entity24 have discovered a specific type of cell , known as @entity7 , help convert white or ' bad ' fat into ' good ' brown fat			1
they believe the study could pave the way for a pill to treat obesity , and help combat obesity - related diseases the human body has two types of fat tissue			0
when a person eats too many calories without burning them off , they are stored as white fat cells			1
that is what causes a person to put on weight			0
@entity47 fat cells burn excess energy and subsquently reduce the size and numbers of white fat cells			1
the new study found @entity7 , which live in white fat tissue and limit the development of obesity by increasing energy levels , play a part in controlling weight gain			1
they help transform white ' bad ' fat into brown ' good ' , in turn helping combat diabetes , heart disease and other life - threatening conditions linked to obesity			0
past studies have revealed problems with the function of these cells has been found to cause obesity in mice			0
but more recent experiments on white fat tissue have revealed the abnormalities are also present in humans and have an impact on energy metabolism			2
this new piece of research found @entity80 stimulates the browning of white fat in response to a signalling protein called @entity85 - 33			2
the new research was carried out by researchers at @entity24 's @entity23			0
professor @entity88 and colleagues also showed that when mice are injected with @entity85 - 33 they accumulated more @entity7 in their white fat , which burned up calories and decreased their weight compared with animals not given the treatment			1
white fat cells , right , accumulate in the body when a person eats too many calories , but fails to burn them off			1
@entity47 fat cells , left , burn excess energy , and help reduce the size and number of white fat cells , thus helping a person to lose weight one in four adults in @entity109 is obese and these figures are set to climb to 60 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women by 2050			1
obesity and diabetes already costs the @entity115 over £ 5 billion every year which is likely to rise to £ 50 billion in the next 36 years			0
as well as helping people to lose weight a drug which turned white cells into brown cells would reduce the chance of developing type 2 diabetes and protect against heart disease			2
professor @entity88 , of @entity23 in @entity24 , said : ' here we identify @entity7 in human white adipose tissue and demonstrate decreased @entity129 responses are a conserved characteristic of obesity in humans and mice			2
' @entity85 ( @entity85 ) -33 was found to be critical for the maintenance of @entity7 in white adipose tissue and in limiting adiposity in mice by increasing caloric expenditure			0

scientists in @entity24 found @entity7 help convert white fat into brown
white fat is stored when a person eats too many calories without burning them off , causing them to put on weight
@entity47 fat cells burn excess energy and help reduce the amount of white fat
