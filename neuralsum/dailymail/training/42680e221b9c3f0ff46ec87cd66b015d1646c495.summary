baby food maker @entity0 is being sued by the @entity3 government after allegedly claiming falsely that its @entity5 formula can prevent or reduce allergies in children			1
in a complaint filed on thursday in court , the @entity8 said the @entity12 - based firm put labels on the product saying it would ' reduce the risk of developing allergies '			1
it claims these stickers contained bogus information , including the suggestion that the formula was the first to meet government approval for reducing the risk of allergies			1
one label , released by the @entity8 , shows a youngster staring wide - eyed at the camera , with the caption : ' i love mommy 's eyes , not her allergies '			1
lawsuit : this label from @entity0 's @entity5 formula , released by the @entity8 , shows a baby staring wide - eyed at the camera , with the caption : ' i love mommy 's eyes , not her allergies ' the @entity8 says it wants @entity42 - which is also doing business as @entity44 - to pull its claim from formula labels and advertisements			1
at some point , it may even ask the court to require that @entity0 issue refunds to consumers for the $ 20 - plus packages sold since 2011			0
however , in a statement , @entity0 said it had not violated the law			0
' we are defending our position because we believe we have met , and will continue to meet , all legal requirements to make these product claims , ' @entity56 , @entity0 's vice president and general counsel , said			1
claims : the @entity3 government says @entity0 has falsely claimed that its @entity5 formula ( pictured ) can prevent or reduce allergies in children the main issue in the case is how far @entity0 went when claiming that its formula could prevent atopic dermatitis , a skin rash known as baby eczema that can be caused by allergies			1
according to the @entity8 , @entity0 had petitioned the @entity74 in 2009 for permission to connect its use of partially hydrolyzed whey proteins to reducing atopic dermatitis			0
the @entity74 agreed , but only if @entity0 qualified its statement by making clear that there was ' little scientific evidence ' for the relationship			0
instead , packages of @entity5 in 2011 suggested it was the first formula approved by the @entity74 to reduce the risk that a baby would develop allergies in general			2
no qualifier was included , and the labels could easily be interpreted to mean that the formula could prevent a child from developing life - threatening food or environmental allergies , the @entity8 said			2
' parents trusted @entity0 to tell the truth about the health benefits of its formula , and the company 's ads failed to live up to that trust , ' said @entity102 , director of the @entity8 's bureau of consumer protection			2
' @entity0 did n't have evidence to back up its claim that @entity5 formula reduces the risk of babies developing their parents ' allergies			2
' in its statement , released on thursday , @entity0 reiterated the claim that its formula can help prevent baby eczema , and said the company had been authorized by the @entity74 to feature that claim			0
' @entity0 always has and will continue to treat its mission of delivering nutrition and benefits to infants as its top priority , ' mr @entity56 wrote			0
dispute : ' parents trusted @entity0 to tell the truth about the health benefits of its formula , and the company 's ads failed to live up to that trust , ' said @entity102 ( left ) , director of the @entity8 's bureau of consumer protection ' we believe the information conveyed in our marketing is important for parents who have children at risk for atopic dermatitis , the most common allergy in infancy			1
' with @entity0 suggesting that it refuses to settle , the case will likely be decided by a district court in @entity12 , where the firm 's headquarters is located			0
the @entity8 has not yet determined whether consumer refunds may be necessary			0
