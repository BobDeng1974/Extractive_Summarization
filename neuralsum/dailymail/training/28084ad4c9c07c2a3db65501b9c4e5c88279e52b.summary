for @entity1 , the international break has arrived just in time			1
some time and space are required to patch up a few bodies and take a breath after what has been a fraught and testing summer transfer window			2
when @entity11 ’s players return to @entity12 for the resumption of the @entity14 in less than two weeks , however , they will face just the same challenges as an evolving squad tries to tackle confidence problems and a new system			1
@entity1 manager @entity19 appeared to indicate after this scoreless and largely thrill-less draw at @entity23 on saturday that there is no going back from the 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 formation he is trying to drill into his players			1
video scoll down for @entity11 on another poor @entity1 result tactics : @entity11 has shown little sign he will deviate from the 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 system he used at the @entity31 as a result , then , @entity1 ’s destiny would appear to lie more than ever in the hands and hearts of its players			1
vice-captain @entity38 underlined that fact when he insisted there was no point hiding behind the difficulties and uncertainty that come with fundamental change			1
‘ we are n’t doing that at all , ’ insisted @entity38 , who has started every league game under @entity19 this season			1
‘ we have to master the system and we have to play better and win individual battles			2
‘ there are other things that come into it apart from the system			2
i am confident that we will put things right if we keep believing in ourselves and the manager			2
‘ this is another disappointing result so when we come back from our internationals we are going to have to work on things			2
everything is new but basic football principles come into it , too			0
we are trying our best			0
we just need to keep believing in the manager ’s philosophies and ideas			0
’ vice-captain : @entity38 said that all of @entity1 's players are working hard at adjusting to the new system struggle : @entity72 has struggled to impose himself on games under @entity11 with @entity1 agreeing £ 14.25m rising to £ 15.8m for @entity74 , @entity11 ’s net spend on transfer fees is £ 149m — just £ 74m less than sir @entity77 paid out in his 21 @entity14 seasons			1
the @entity14 ’s @entity80 net spenders @entity81 - £ 224.6m ( @entity82 only ) sir @entity77 - £ 222.7m ( @entity1 , @entity14 only ) @entity84 - £ 183.8m ( @entity82 ) @entity85 - £ 174m ( @entity86 ) @entity87 - £ 167.13m ( @entity86 ) @entity11 - £ 149.1m ( @entity1 ) @entity88 - £ 120.71m ( @entity82 ) @entity89 - £ 120m.13m ( @entity90 ) @entity91 - £ 113.63m ( @entity86 ) @entity92 - £ 105.94m ( @entity90 ) @entity1 were slightly better at @entity93 than they had been in losing to @entity94 and drawing at @entity95 in previous @entity14 matches			1
new signing @entity97 enjoyed an impressive debut and @entity1 enjoyed enough possession			1
still , though , there were signs of the disconnect between the manager ’s theory and his players ’ execution			2
at times the simple things continued to look rather difficult			0
‘ it ’s mentally challenging but that ’s always been the case here , ’ added @entity38			1
‘ it ’s mentally challenging playing for a club of this size			0
the players are well used to that			2
‘ as players learning a new system and developing new ideas you know it ’s going to make you a better player in the long term , without a doubt			2
‘ it ’s training , videos , constant learning , looking over every match			0
we are putting a lot of effort into it and there has been improvement , but there is going to have to be a lot more if we are going to get where we want to be			0
‘ we have to look to ourselves			0
we expect the other top teams to win but we have to start winning , too			0
it ’s a long season but we need to get going			0
’ after saturday ’s game in blustery @entity144 , @entity19 himself looked a little like a man who wanted to get away and reflect on what he has learned during his first weeks of competitive action in @entity148			0
for now , the @entity150 ’s message continues to be the same : namely that over time , improvement will come			0
‘ i think you can only judge after one season and not in weeks or months or something like that , ’ said the @entity1 manager			1
transfer : @entity1 spent a record £ 60million on signing @entity97 from @entity158 ‘ i think we have to rebuild a new team and what i have already said is that this needs time			1
‘ at the moment i have to repeat myself every week when we are losing points			0
you are tired of my answer but also the fans shall be tired of them soon and that ’s not a good way to discuss that subject			0
’ with @entity150 utility player @entity74 the latest significant signing of @entity1 ’s summer , @entity19 can certainly not claim to have had anything other than appropriate financial backing from the club			1
by the time @entity177 visit @entity178 on september 14 , competition for places should be relatively lively			0
it will be interesting to see how many times @entity19 is brave enough to play @entity181 , @entity72 , @entity182 and @entity183 in the same team			1
on saturday ’s evidence , @entity72 looks the most vulnerable to change but @entity182 , too , must find some of his real form			1
his partnership with @entity188 is now in its third season but still appears to need work			1
@entity19 said : ‘ you have seen what @entity182 was doing , eh ? he ’s running everywhere in the game			1
‘ it ’s always difficult when you do n’t score as a striker to say , “ ok , he played fantastic ”			0
it ’s always difficult to say that			0
but he gives an example in hard work for the team			2
’ super stat : @entity23 have kept only four clean sheets in 41 @entity14 matches ... but two have come against @entity1			1
the @entity23 beat @entity1 1 - 0 at @entity93 in 2009 with a goal from @entity208			1
@entity23 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity209 7 ; @entity210 6.5 , @entity211 8 , @entity212 7 , @entity213 6 ; @entity214 6 , @entity215 7 , @entity216 6.5 , @entity217 6 ( @entity218 88min ) ; @entity219 5.5 ( @entity220 78 ) , @entity221 6			1
subs not used : @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227			0
booked : @entity216 , @entity218			0
@entity1 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity228 7.5 ; @entity229 6 , @entity215 6 , @entity230 5.5 ; @entity231 5.5 , @entity38 6 , @entity181 7 ( @entity232 70 , 6 ) , @entity233 6 ; @entity72 5.5 ( @entity234 87 ) ; @entity182 6 , @entity188 6.5 ( @entity235 73 , 6 )			1
subs not used : @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240			0
booked : @entity38 , @entity230			2
man of the match : @entity211			0
referee : @entity244 6 .			0

@entity11 shows no sign of deviating from 3 - 4 - 1 - 2
even after @entity1 's goalless draw with @entity23
@entity182 and @entity183 partnership still needs work
@entity38 says it is up to the players to adjust
international break may be *welcomed* at @entity12
