by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political editor @entity3 : 17:10 est , 28 december 2013 @entity4 : 08:46 est , 29 december 2013 @entity6 's hopes of ousting @entity7 as @entity8 were hit last night after a shocking foul - mouthed outburst by the former cabinet minister			1
in an extraordinary interview , the mp – who was made a dame last year and is known for her ‘ mumsy image ’ – used the word ‘ f * * * ’ four times in addition to ‘ s * * * ’ , ‘ a * * * * * * e ’ and ‘ penis ’			1
her comments came in an interview with the @entity24 - supporting @entity23 intended to promote her campaign to become @entity24 ’s candidate in the 2016 @entity28 poll			1
back together : @entity6 ( left ) split with her husband @entity29 ( right ) , but they have since got back together			1
they now spend weekends in the @entity33 , where mr @entity29 lives , and weekdays in @entity28 but it backfired badly as @entity23 attacked her , calling her a ‘ broken model ’ and accusing her of faking emotion when she burst into tears			1
@entity40 ’s tirade came as she was asked about her split from her husband , lawyer @entity29 , who was prosecuted in @entity42 for allegedly accepting a bribe from @entity44 when @entity6 was a minister			1
she always said she knew nothing about it and the couple separated , prompting claims they had done so to protect her career			0
' @entity52 model ' : @entity40 was accused of faking emotion when she burst into tears during an interview with @entity23 they have since got back together and she was subsequently honoured for her work on the @entity58			1
dame @entity40 , 66 , who is to stand down as mp for @entity59 in @entity60 for the mayoral challenge , attacked the way she was treated by the press , saying : ‘ those a * * * * * * es are so f * * * * * * rancid that i just hope every morning they wake up and think , ‘ ‘ i ’m ashamed of the job i do			1
’ ’ ' to say that somehow i got up one morning and thought , ‘ ‘ you know what i ’m going to do today , i think i ’m going to separate from my husband ? ’ ’ f * * * off			2
‘ there was a toerag who slept in his little white van outside my house for six days ... and for five days i was intimidated			0
and then i was coming out to go to the gym at eight o’clock on a saturday morning , and there he was with his f * * * * * * , you know , penis - like lens , waving out of the window			1
i banged on the roof of his minivan and i said , ‘ ‘ you f * * * off out of here in ten minutes or i ’m calling the police			2
” ’ in a cruel put - down , interviewer @entity90 says : ‘ when she tells me she wants to discuss the “ broken model of politics ” , she knows what she is talking about			2
' but i confess the broken model i keep seeing in my head when we meet is n’t the one @entity6 is worried about			0
’ ms @entity90 continues : ‘ within minutes she is telling me about the woman who made the fabulous dress she is wearing			0
her manner is both animated and amazingly intimate and , as she talks about the issues that have meant most to her , her eyes well up so many times that i lose count			0
shattered hopes : dame @entity40 's hopes of ousting @entity7 as @entity28 mayor have been hit after the shocking foul - mouthed outburst			1
above , @entity6 is pictured with mr @entity7 at the @entity111 in @entity28 allegations : the dame 's tirade came as she was asked about her split from mr @entity29 ( left ) , who was prosecuted in @entity42 for allegedly accepting a bribe from @entity44 ( right ) when @entity6 was a minister ‘ essentially , she is describing everything you would want a politician to be – idealistic , dedicated , emotionally engaged			1
and yet i ca n’t stop thinking about @entity121 , or picturing the @entity124 satire ’s spin doctor , @entity125 , telling @entity6 what to say			0
‘ so when a chat about her dressmaker segues into a wider conversation about ethics , it sounds suspiciously like code for “ i ’m not dodgy			0
” ’ @entity40 and @entity133 now spend weekends at their country house in the @entity33 , where he lives , and during the week he visits @entity6 at her @entity28 home			2
‘ but nothing will ever be the same , ’ the mp said			0
‘ of course all that s * * * still affects us all			2
’ but she insists fear of further press scrutiny will not stop her trying to oust mr @entity7			0
‘ i will not be cowed by what people in the press who do n’t like my politics decide to do to me			0
’ one of mr @entity7 ’s allies said last night : ‘ if poor old @entity151 ca n’t stand the heat , she should get away from the @entity153			0
@entity7 has been on the rough end of far worse from the feral beasts of the @entity156 over his private life – and has never whinged , let alone sworn like a trooper			0
