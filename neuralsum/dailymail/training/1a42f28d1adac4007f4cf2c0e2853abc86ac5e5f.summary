by @entity0 a holidaymaker who left his motor in a near empty car park has been fined after he veered into a marked bay by the width of a tyre			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , broke the strict terms and conditions after marginally overshooting his space at a privately - run car park in @entity14			1
the 61 - year - old was visiting the county for a few days with his wife when he decided to see @entity18 , where the hit tv show @entity20 is filmed			1
this photo was taken by @entity7 to show the position of his car when he got a £ 100 parking ticket in @entity25 , @entity14 mr @entity7 bought a £ 3 ticket , went into the village and enjoyed walking around the tv set			1
but when he returned he was shocked to find he 'd been fined			2
he said : ' when i returned to the car park i found a @entity31 which said i was not wholly within the parking bay			2
i agree i was about eight inches outside the bay on the passenger side - i had n't noticed			0
' but the car park was less than five per cent full so i was n't inconveniencing anyone and as this was late afternoon the car park was n't going to get any fuller			0
' now i have been stung with a £ 100 fine for my being the two hand - widths out of line			1
' i 'm quite prepared to pay them £ 3 for parking in the " 2nd bay " but they do n't allow any right of appeal for anything other than exceptional circumstances			2
they basically write their own rules and laws ! ' the car park is privately - run and enforcement is carried out by @entity55 - based firm @entity54 @entity7 also took this picture showing how empty the car park in @entity25 was terms and conditions : the sign at a car park in @entity18 where @entity7 got a £ 100 parking ticket for parking outside a marked bay @entity66 ( centre ) stars in the @entity68 show @entity20 , set in @entity25 enforcement of @entity18 's car parking rules is carried out by a @entity55 - based firm @entity54			1
@entity73 manager @entity72 said : ' i have now reviewed this and can see that the notice was issued correctly as the vehicle was not parked within a single allocated bay			0
' @entity79 of use apply at all times and are non-negotiable , therefore the issuing officer was correct in issuing the notice			0
' we have to issue notices for all contraventions , however minor they may appear to onlookers , in order to remain fair and consistent			0
' had we not issued a ticket in this instance and issued a ticket to a neighbouring vehicle for having no ticket ( for example ) , the motorist could rightly complain that they were alienated as the neighbouring vehicle also failed to adhere to the @entity99 's			0
' having said the above , if a motorist appeals in cases such as this ( i.e. minor contraventions ) we always offer a concession as a gesture of good will ; instructing them to ensure that they adhere to the rules in future			0

@entity7 , 61 , from @entity9 , was visiting @entity14 for a few days
but when he parked up in @entity25 he veered into another bay
he bought a ticket , but when he returned he found he 'd been fined
mr @entity7 said : ' now i have been stung with a £ 100 fine . this is absurd '
