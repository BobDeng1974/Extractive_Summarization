by @entity0 last updated at 1:56 am on 1st october 2011 dilemma : sir @entity2 has got motor neurone disease sir @entity2 , the former head of @entity4 , says he would now consider going to the @entity6 clinic to kill himself after watching a controversial @entity8 documentary			1
he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease five years ago and now , at 64 , he can no longer walk or move his arms			1
sir @entity2 , who took on the left - wing establishment during his six years in charge of the education watchdog , had previously ruled out travelling to an assisted suicide clinic			1
two years ago he said : ‘ i would be more likely to drive myself off a cliff in @entity16 than go to @entity6 and speak to a bearded social worker			2
’ but he admitted in a new interview that the @entity20 programme , @entity21 : choosing to @entity22 , had changed his mind			2
the documentary , broadcast in june , showed the death of millionaire @entity26 at the @entity28 clinic			2
mr @entity26 , 71 , also a motor neurone disease ( @entity31 ) sufferer , gave writer sir @entity21 and the tv crew permission to film him drinking poison at @entity6 with his wife @entity34 , 60 , at his side			1
he was seen choking and gasping for water after he swallowed the barbiturate - based drink			2
sir @entity2 said : ‘ it was very dignified			1
his wife was there and they sat on the sofa together			2
it was 30 seconds or so , and he was coughing a bit and he looked in some discomfort , but i thought it was n’t a bad way to go			2
’ sir @entity2 indicated that his views have been shaped by his parents ’ deaths			1
he suspects his father may have had undiagnosed @entity31 , which destroys brain cells and leads to paralysis and possible suffocation			0
from the @entity8 film : @entity26 shakes hands with sir @entity21 moving : a scene from the @entity20 documentary choosing to @entity22			1
@entity26 is comforted by a woman @entity6 as his wife ( in navy blue ) looks on referring to his parents , sir @entity2 said : ‘ the last five years of their lives , increasingly they felt , “ why ca n’t we be allowed to die ? why ca n’t we just hold hands together and go ? ” they became increasingly irascible as they became increasingly desperate about their plight			1
‘ their experience , and my experience watching them , and my experience now , makes me feel that there are no persuasive arguments against			0
’ sir @entity2 said his dilemma is that if he waits too long , he may no longer be capable of swallowing the liquid drugs used by the clinic			1
he said : ‘ it ’s an issue for me , an incredibly difficult issue , as to what point you decide you ’ve had enough and you kill yourself			0
' [ the government ] decided their could be a badger cull ... maybe they could agree on a cull of the terminally ill ' ‘ the decision can not be entirely your own : @entity34 , my wife , @entity88 , my daughter , maybe even my granddaughter , the oldest one – they ’ve all got views			0
‘ if it were n’t for them i might already have said i ’d had enough			0
’ sir @entity2 , who once claimed there were 15,000 incompetent teachers in the education system , believes it is an outrage that terminally ill patients have to travel abroad to end their lives in a way of their choosing			1
he added : ‘ the thing that worries me about assisted dying is i do n’t think our politicians are ever going to have the b * * * s. ‘ maybe i ’m wrong			0
they ’ve decided that there could be a badger cull ; maybe they could agree , too , that there should be a cull of the terminally ill ! ’ almost 900 viewers made formal complaints to the @entity8 about the programme by sir @entity21 , who has @entity115 ’s , while others took to internet sites to accuse the corporation of ‘ romanticising ’ and ‘ normalising ’ assisted death			1
controversial : more than 150 @entity120 have ended their lives at the @entity6 clinic in @entity122 ( pictured ) over the past eight years the charity , @entity123 , warned that the documentary posed a ‘ significant risk ’ to vulnerable people and said copycat suicides were ‘ highly likely ’			0
more than 150 @entity120 have ended their lives at the @entity6 clinic in @entity122 over the past eight years , taking advantage of @entity28 laws that allow assisted suicide			0
this has opened up cracks in @entity120 law , under which helping someone to commit suicide is a crime carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years in jail			0
it is usually impossible for someone who is seriously ill to travel to die without help from family or friends			0
the @entity145 , @entity146 , drew up guidelines suggesting that those who help a death will not be prosecuted it they act out of compassion and do not stand to gain from it			0
no one has been prosecuted over a @entity6 death , even though mr @entity156 has been given nearly 40 cases to consider since his guidelines were published .			0
