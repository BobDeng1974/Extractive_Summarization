by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 published : 20:58 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 22:48 est , 6 september 2012 vice president @entity3 has declared that ‘ @entity8 is coming back ’ and delivered a powerful personal appeal for he and president @entity5 to be re-elected to continue ‘ a mission we will complete ’			1
@entity3 , known for his verbal miscues , stuck closely to a script in which the @entity11 had helped draw up with the aim of his offering personal testimony about @entity5 ’s character , determination and dedication			1
‘ @entity18 , tonight , i want to tell you about @entity5 , ’ he said			2
‘ the @entity5 i ’ve come to know			2
i want to show you the character of a leader - who had what it took , when the @entity8 people stood at the brink of a new depression			2
a leader who has what it takes to lead us over the next four years - to a future as great as our people			2
’ speech : vice president @entity3 delivered a fiery speech to the @entity38 congratulations : second lady @entity40 joined her husband on stage at the end of his speech hug : the couple have been married for 25 years and have raised three children @entity5 , he said , had rescued @entity8 from a depression			1
‘ day after day , night after night , i sat beside him , as he made one gutsy decision after another - to stop the slide and reverse it			2
i watched him stand up to intense pressure and stare down choices of enormous consequence			2
most of all , i saw what drove him : his profound concern for the @entity8 people			2
’ he continued : ‘ folks , i ’ve watched him			2
he asks the same thing over and over again : how is this going to work for ordinary families ? will it help them ? ‘ and because of the decisions he ’s made , and the strength the @entity8 people have demonstrated every day , @entity8 has turned the corner			0
after the worst job loss since the @entity69 , we ’ve created 4.5 million private sector jobs in the past 29 months			0
’ @entity3 , who served in the @entity71 for 36 years before becoming vice-president in 2008 , also drew a sharp contrast between @entity5 and his rival @entity74 , the @entity75 nominee			1
fierce : mr @entity3 delivered an aggressive speech in defence of the @entity5 administration 's record arena : the speech was moved from a nearby stadium , apparently due to concerns about the weather tribute : mr @entity3 devoted a large part of his speech to standing up for his boss , president @entity5 talking about @entity5 ’s successful bailout of the car industry , @entity3 took the opportunity to castigate @entity74 for opposing for it and for his work heading up the venture capital firm @entity95			1
‘ when i look back now on the president ’s decision , i also think of another son of an automobile man - @entity74 , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity74 grew up in @entity100			0
‘ yet he was willing to let @entity100 go bankrupt			0
it ’s not that he ’s a bad guy			0
i ’m sure he grew up loving cars as much as i did			0
i just do n’t think he understood - i just do n’t think he understood what saving the automobile industry meant to all of @entity8			0
i think he saw it the @entity95 way			0
’ @entity3 also spoke extensively about the mission to kill @entity112 in may 2011			1
he said : ‘ in 2008 , @entity5 made a promise to the @entity8 people			0
he said , “ if we have @entity112 in our sights , we will take him out			1
that has to be our biggest national security priority			0
” supporters : @entity119 joined her mother @entity120 and @entity40 to watch the vice president 's speech earlier : mrs @entity40 told the convention about her ongoing career as a teacher in @entity126 nomination : mr @entity3 's son @entity128 gave the speech officially nominating the vice president for re-election ‘ @entity5 understood that the search for @entity112 was about a lot more than taking a monstrous leader off the battlefield			1
it was about righting an unspeakable wrong , healing a nearly unbearable wound in @entity8 ’s heart			0
‘ he also knew the message we had to send to terrorists around the world — if you attack innocent @entity8 , we will follow you to the ends of the earth			1
most of all , the president had faith in our special forces -- the finest warriors the world has ever known			1
‘ we sat for days in the @entity150			0
he listened to the risks and reservations about the raid			0
and he asked the tough questions			0
but when admiral @entity159 looked him in the eye and said , “ sir , we can get this done ” , i knew at that moment @entity5 had made his decision			0
‘ but governor @entity74 did n’t see things that way			0
when he was asked about @entity112 in 2007 , he said , and i quote , “ it ’s not worth moving heaven and earth , and spending billions of dollars , just trying to catch one person ”			1
if you understood that @entity8 ’s heart had to be healed , you would have done exactly what the president did			1
and you too would have moved @entity169 -- to hunt down @entity112 , and bring him to justice			1
’ summing up the @entity5 - @entity3 campaign message in bumper - sticker style , he said to resounding cheers : ‘ @entity112 is dead , and @entity180 is alive			1

vice president plays ' attack dog ' role as he tears into @entity75 plans
returns to *favourite* *slogan* : ' @entity112 is dead and @entity180 is alive '
