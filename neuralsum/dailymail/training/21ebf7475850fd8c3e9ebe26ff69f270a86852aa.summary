the outlook for the economy is worsening , international experts said yesterday			1
the @entity3 expects output to shrink by 0.7 per cent this year – far worse than the 0.5 per cent growth it had predicted in may			1
coalition ministers warned however that there was no ‘ quick fix ’ for the economy while ridiculing @entity10 ’s solution to add more debt			0
hard times : the @entity14 is unlikely to pull out of its double - dip recession this quarter , global economic think tank the @entity3 has warned , meaning more suffering for @entity14 businesses and consumers the @entity20 - based @entity3 also cut its forecasts for other major developed countries including @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
but the @entity14 downgrade was by far the worst and came as a blow to chancellor @entity29 ’s battle to drag the economy out of recession and wipe out the deficit inherited from @entity10			1
@entity33 said yesterday that it was difficult to kickstart growth : ‘ if there was a button you could push in @entity39 which just said “ right , growth comes ” i would have pushed it long ago			0
what the government can do is set the conditions for growth , provide that background of low interest rates , low tax rates – which we ’ve done in this country – a steady and sensible government , then we ’ll find that households will want to come forward and business will want to come forward and invest			0
’ in the @entity55 , @entity54 business secretary @entity54 exploded with uncharacteristic anger as @entity10 challenged the government ’s economic record			0
he said @entity14 ’s problems stemmed from a @entity10 boom that was allowed to go ‘ out of control ’ , with ‘ broken banks , a very serious consumer debt problem and very major problems in our export market ’			2
world in crisis : this table shows the @entity3 's predictions for annualised quarter - on - quarter growth in the @entity74 economies in a speech in @entity76 last night , mr @entity29 admitted the economic outlook remained uncertain but insisted there were some positive signs			1

‘ but the scale of the challenge is so great there are no quick fixes or easy routes to recovery			0
‘ nobody is offering a credible or convincing alternative economic strategy			0
there is no easy path to recovery and prosperity			0
we in @entity14 have to confront our problems head on , be honest about the scale of the challenge , and be consistent in our determination to succeed			2
’ @entity14 is in the worst double - dip recession for more than 50 years and the longest period of economic weakness for a century			1
the slump which started in 2008 outstrips even the @entity113 of the 1930s			0
possible booster : the @entity3 's predictions do not take into account the effect of the @entity119 , which may help to boost the economy			1
however initial signs have been that it has not had the expected impact however , analysts said the @entity3 outlook for the @entity14 was ‘ overly pessimistic ’ because it did not take account of any bounce back from the disruption caused by the @entity129			1
the @entity130 has cut its 2012 forecast to 0.2 per cent growth while the @entity132 is expecting stagnation			1
the @entity3 has been one of mr @entity29 ’s most influential supporters and has defended the chancellor ’s austerity plans			1
@entity138 , of the @entity3 , said the slump was down to global factors , such as the eurozone , and added that the chancellor ’s plan to tackle the deficit was ‘ appropriate ’			2
