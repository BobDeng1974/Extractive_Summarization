the original show , started in october 1998 , featured a wooden bench – and it has since come along way			0
given the nature of live television , there have been a number of infamous incidents over the years			1
there was the glorious moment in 2010 when @entity43 , in full flow on @entity45 , goes over to @entity46 live at @entity47 for @entity48 versus @entity49 where there has just been a red card			0
‘ i do n’t know @entity43 , has there ? ’ @entity46 says in a panic			0
‘ i must ’ve missed that			0
red card ? ’ he continues to look backwards and forward from the pitch to the camera in disbelief			0
and there was the time @entity61 has a slip - of - the - tongue when explaining @entity64 ’s loan move from @entity65 to @entity49 in 2011			2
‘ @entity67 now going from a @entity69 sh * * * y shirt into a @entity49 shirt , ’ he says , without a hint of a smile			0
work in progress : the new studio where @entity75 will present his deadline day coverage takes shape getting there : builders scurry around to get the home of sports news on @entity4 ready for august 12 having a laugh : @entity46 's gaffes on @entity1 have made him into a cult hero among fans previous presenters over the years have included @entity88 and @entity89 while household names @entity20 and @entity75 still present today			1
