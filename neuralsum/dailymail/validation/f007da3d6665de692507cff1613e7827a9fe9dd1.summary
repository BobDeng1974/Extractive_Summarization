' my reptiles are my children , ' said mr @entity9 , from @entity42			1
' i made the decision a long time ago that it would take a lot to commit to a long - term relationship or have children of my own because my pets mean the world to me			0
' i had a girlfriend while i was at college and there 's no doubt that that the reptiles were a key factor in the reason we split : she hated them ! i 've been single ever since			2
' occasionally there have been opportunities and nice people who have tried to flirt with me but i know they 'd never understand my reptiles , or put up with sharing the bed with a lizard			0

hands - on : mr @entity9 has been passionate about reptiles since he was just a child danger : these photographs show the gory bites mr @entity9 has sustained from his beloved animals he said : ' their frustrations can be taken out on the owner so of course they can be dangerous			1

the problem is recognising the warning signs			0
' what i like about reptiles is that they 're difference from your usual household pets			0

there is nothing more rewarding than that			0
' and at least they never nag me to do the washing up			0
