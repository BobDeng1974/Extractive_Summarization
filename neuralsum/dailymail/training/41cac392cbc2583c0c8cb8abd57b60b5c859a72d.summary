by @entity1 reporter published : 12:43 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 11 january 2013 the @entity2 has announced that it will require manufacturers of zolpidem , a popular sleeping pill commonly sold as brands including @entity7 and @entity7 , to reduce recommended dosages amid concerns about morning drowsiness caused by the pills			1
new research released thursday shows that the drugs remains in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with alertness and coordination , which increases the risk of car accidents			2
regulators are ordering drug manufacturers to cut the dose of the medications in half for women , who process the drug more slowly			2
hidden dangers : new research shows that zolpidem remains in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with alertness and coordination the @entity2 has recommended drug companies reduce the recommended dosage of @entity7 because it causes morning drowsiness doses will be lowered from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams for regular products , and 12.5 milligrams to 6.25 milligrams for extended - release formulations			1
the @entity2 is recommending that manufacturers apply these lower doses to men as well , though it is not making them a requirement			2
a @entity42 study published in the @entity43 last year found that sleeping pill usage may have contributed to as many as 500,000 ' excess deaths ' in the @entity46 in 2010 , and noted that sleeping pill users have a fivefold increased risk of ' early death			2
' the new doses apply to all insomnia treatments containing the drug zolpidem , which is sold under different brands including @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity55 , @entity7 , @entity56 and in generic forms			1
it is the most widely prescribed sleeping aid in the @entity46 the changes do n't affect other popular sleeping medicines like @entity61 and sonata , which use different drugs			1
@entity2 officials pointed out that all sleeping drugs carry warnings about drowsiness			0
morning drowsiness caused by sleeping pills containing zolpidem has been found to interfere with alertness and coordination , increasing the risk of car accidents @entity7 has been blamed for high - profile driving accidents involving @entity76 and @entity77 ‘ all sleep drugs have the potential to cause this , so health professionals should prescribe - and patients should take - the lowest dose that is capable of preventing insomnia , ’ said dr. @entity78 , a director in @entity2 's @entity79			1
@entity78 added that the @entity2 will begin requiring developers of sleep drugs to conduct driving simulation studies going forward			0
@entity7 has been blamed for several recent high - profile driving accidents in the past year , including @entity76 in september and @entity77 in july			1
the @entity2 has received more than 700 reports of driving - related problems connected to zolpidem over the years			1
‘ but in most cases it was very difficult to determine if the driving impairment was actually related to zolpidem , ’ @entity78 said			0
‘ usually the reports did not contain information about when the accident happened or how much time had lapsed since taking the drug			0
’ the agency decided to take action after recent driving simulation studies showed that , in some patients , drug levels remained high enough to cause difficulty driving			2
the data came from company studies of @entity110 , a new form of zolpidem which was approved in 2011 for people who wake late at night and ca n't get back to sleep			0
the data showed that 33 percent of women and 25 percent of men taking extended - release zolpidem had enough of the drug in their blood to interfere with driving as much as eight hours later			1
@entity7 is present in sleeping aids including @entity55 and has been found to have a much stronger effect on women than men when the dose was cut in half only 15 percent of women and five percent of men had those same drug levels			1
@entity2 analysis was unable to determine why women metabolize zolpidem so much more slowly than men			1
according to @entity2 staff , the difference can not be accounted for by usual factors like size and weight			0
for now , patients should continue taking their currently prescribed dose until they can talk to their doctor about the best way to proceed			0
‘ we really do n't want people to change the dose they 're on			0
we want them to talk to their health care provider , ' @entity78 said			0
@entity7 is marketed by @entity145 , @entity110 by @entity146 and @entity55 by @entity147			0

it has been blamed for several recent high - profile driving accidents , including @entity76 and @entity77
