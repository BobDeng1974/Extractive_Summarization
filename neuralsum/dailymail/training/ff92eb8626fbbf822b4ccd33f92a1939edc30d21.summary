by @entity0 last updated at 1:56 am on 29th september 2011 the first tv commercial for a sex toy company has been approved for broadcast during daytime viewing hours			1
executives at the firm involved , @entity6 , have hailed the development as a breakthrough in terms of the nation ’s attitude to sex and pleasure			1
however , the decision has triggered anger among family campaigners who argue it turns sex into a commodity			1
the commercial , which carries the strapline ‘ @entity21 ’ advertises the company rather than any specific products			2
racy ? a still from the @entity6 advert to be shown on television and used as a print ad in women 's magazines such as @entity30 nonetheless , parents may find it difficult to explain away the tv commercial and the internet shopping site that is being promoted			2
it features a couple in a steamy embrace , kissing passionately for around 20 seconds			2
they then break away as they laugh and giggle and say to each other ‘ have a good day ’			2
a recent study claimed that @entity43 and international sales of sex toys are set to match smartphones like the @entity46			1
the study , @entity47 , argued that sales of so - called ' pleasure goods ' have escaped their sleazy history and are about to move into the mainstream			0
the research was compiled by respected analysts @entity53 and identified a strong desire among women to buy products designed to enhance their sex lives			1
it stated : ' over 60 per cent of women find the idea of buying a sex toy to be ‘ exciting ’			1
' women are motivated by far more basic instincts than are commonly ascribed to them			0
the erotic , the naughty , the forbidden and even perhaps the slightly sordid all have their appeal			0
' @entity6 , who dub themselves ' sexual happiness people , ' say they 're keen for consumers to cast aside their prudishness and enjoy their sex lives some four million sex toys are said to be sold in the @entity43 every year , while it estimates the number of women using them at 6.5 to 9.6million			1
the decision by regulators to approve the @entity6 commercial follows earlier controversy over the liberalisation of advertising rules			0
last year , industry codes were changed to allow condoms to be advertised before the 9pm watershed			0
an advertisement by the @entity86 organisation , which carries out thousands of abortions each year , drew more complaints than any other last year – 4,600 , including those via petition			0
@entity6 describes itself as ‘ the sexual happiness people ’			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we sell more sex toys online than any other @entity43 company			1
‘ we are now a £ 13.4 million business , fulfilling in excess of 10,000 orders every week			0
’ ' one in two marriages is failing and a way of dealing with that is to use sex toys			1
we should be encouraging it , ' says expert @entity104 an initial booking to show the commercial on @entity107 at 10.15am on october 3 during the programme @entity109 of @entity110 fell through			1
however , @entity6 claims it will be shown during daytime on @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
director of the @entity116 , @entity117 , condemned the decision , saying : ‘ sex is an intimate expression of lifelong commitment between a man and a woman , not a commodity to be advertised and sold like washing powder or a mobile phone			1
‘ sexual intimacy belongs in private and is cheapened when it is paraded on television and used as a tool to entice viewers to visit and make purchases from an online shop			0
‘ many viewers will find this advert very distasteful , not because they are prudes who disapprove of sex , but because it divorces sex from its proper context and further adds to the sexualisation of society with all its damaging consequences			2
’ the web retailer has a relationship with sex therapist @entity104 , who sells a range of products through the site			1
she said the commercial was tame in comparison to the music videos which appear regularly on daytime tv			0
‘ if you look at the ad and compare it to any music video clip – like @entity157 for example – this is pre-school			0
what they get away with in music videos is crazy , ’ she said			0
one in two marriages is failing and a way of dealing with that is to use sex toys			1
we should be encouraging it			0
’ what do you think of the advert ? watch in full here ...			2

family campaign *groups* say *bedroom* toys commodify sex ...
... but relationship expert @entity104 argues using toys could help save the one in two marriages that are failing
