by @entity0 last updated at 9:08 am on 20th december 2011 they have become a tourist attraction in their own right , taken into the hearts of visitors to the beauty spot			2
so popular is this family of boar that they have managed to avoid the chop in the forest of @entity13 's culling programme			1
but not for much longer , as they could only have a few months left to live before being slaughtered			2
this particular group of six have been given a death sentence after the @entity17 decided they would no longer be excluded from the cull - a move which is expected to spark outcry among their fans			1
death sentence : some of the @entity24 graze near the visitor center near @entity26 , blissfully unaware of the fate that could await them out on a limb : @entity17 bosses have confirmed the boars ' exclusion from previous culls will come to an end in march next year the animals have become a firm favourite with visitors to the @entity41 beauty spot 's @entity39 tourist centre near @entity26			1
the boar - dubbed the @entity24 - are often seen grubbing for food in the grounds surrounding the tourist centre , and have built up quite a following			1
so far they have been spared from any culling by the @entity17 over to concerns at opposition to the move			1
however @entity17 bosses have now confirmed their exclusion from previous culls will come to an end in march next year			1
a spokesman said : ' a decision was taken back in the summer , when local people were focused on this particular family of boar , not to cull them as part of the overall cull of wild boar			2
' a new cull target will be set in march 2012 based upon the best available information			0
it does not follow that these particular animals will be either targeted or not targeted in 2012/13			0
' common problems : the @entity13 has long had a population of wild boar ( pictured ) but environmentalists have called for a closed season on hunting the boar to help them flourish pricey problem : it costs the @entity17 £ 50,000 a year to cull boar in @entity13 @entity26 's @entity75 councillor @entity74 , said : ' there could well be a public outcry if that family of boar is culled			1
' people have taken them into their hearts			0
the thing is , people have been feeding them , which then domesticates them			0
' people would help them more by not feeding them			0
they get too familiar with people if they get fed , and that ’s when the problems start			0
' he added : ' i personally think the cull was too heavy to start off with			0
we want wild boar in the @entity92 and they need to be managed , but perhaps there were n’t as many as the @entity17 first thought			1
' i think they need to take two steps back and look again at how the population is managed			0
' the selection of cull animals on @entity17 - managed land by its professional wildlife ranger staff takes into account many factors before handing out death sentences			1
this includes the degree of nuisance , perception of levels of aggression , population dynamics and perceived population densities in any given area			0
culling for 2011/12 was completed by the end of september 2011 , so , except for the removal of animals for animal welfare reasons , this year ’s cull has stopped			0
during the most recent census , using night - vision technology , only 16 boar were counted despite the @entity17 previously claiming there were around 350 roaming the @entity92			1
the census , when completed early next year , will help form the @entity17 ’s cull target for 2012			2
meanwhile , environmentalists in the @entity13 have been calling for a closed season on hunting the boar to help them flourish			0
it costs the @entity17 £ 50,000 a year to cull boar in @entity13 .			2

' @entity24 ' so popular they avoid previous death sentences
@entity17 is expecting a *backlash* from the boars ' fans
