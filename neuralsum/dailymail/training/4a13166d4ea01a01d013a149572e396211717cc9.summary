by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 03:04 est , 2 may 2013 native americans are facing the final deadline in their battle to save the @entity5 massacre site - and expressed their outrage at the landowner ' making a buck out of miserable history			2
' the land in @entity11 is where @entity13 troops killed up to 300 @entity16 men , women and children in 1890			1
@entity19 , whose family has owned the property since 1968 , is trying to sell the 40 - acre fraction of the historic landmark for $ 3.9 million			1
he has given the @entity24 until today to agree to the price or plans to open it up to outside investors			0
chief @entity28 , a former chairman of the @entity29 and a traditional chief said : ' the reason he asked for $ 3.9m is because of the land 's historical significance , based on the deaths of hundreds of our relatives			1
if someone turns a buck on our ancestors ' misery then shame on them			0
' anger : the @entity5 site and mass grave - the site where @entity13 troops killed up to 300 @entity16 men , women and children in 1890 is up for sale up for sale : the 40 - acre property in @entity11 is on the market for $ 3.9 million ( about £ 2.5 million ) sale : @entity19 , 74 , is trying to sell a 40 - acre fraction of the landmark for $ 3.9 million to the @entity24			1
but leaders on the @entity56 say the asking price for a property appraised at less than $ 7,000 is just too much the last major bloodshed of the @entity60 occurred on december 29 when the @entity13 troops went into the camp to disarm the men			1
according to the @entity13 version of the story , a deaf tribesman named @entity64 resisted attempts to disarm him that morning and in the struggle a shot was fired			1
@entity13 troops then opened fire in response and a small number of @entity74 fighters who still had guns fired back			1
the @entity76 overwhelmed the @entity74 warriors and began shooting haphazardly killing men , women and children of the @entity74 - they also wounded at least 51			1
@entity13 military authorities awarded twenty troopers the @entity83 for the massacre			1
along with its proximity to the burial grounds , the land includes the site of a former trading post burned down during the 1973 @entity5 uprising , in which hundreds of @entity92 protesters occupied the town built at the site of the 1890 massacre			1
the 71 - day standoff that left two tribal members dead and a federal agent seriously wounded is credited with raising awareness about @entity16 struggles and giving rise to a wider protest movement that lasted the rest of the decade			1
he did n't return calls this week to @entity107 seeking information about the prospective buyers			0
the ultimatum has caused anger among many tribal members and descendants of the massacre victims			0
' i know we are at the 11th hour , but selling this massacre site and using the victims as a selling pitch is , for lack of a better word , it 's grotesque , ' said @entity123 , 56 , whose grandfather was 10 when he survived the massacre ' to use the murdered children , the murdered teenagers , the unborn , women screaming and running for their lives , using that as a selling pitch ... that has got to be the most barbaric thing ever to use as a selling pitch			2
' @entity19 acknowledges the historical significance adds value to each parcel of land , which have each been at less than $ 7,000 apiece , according to records reviewed by the @entity107 besides its proximity to the burial grounds , the land includes the site of a former trading post burned down during the 1973 @entity5 uprising , in which hundreds of @entity92 protesters occupied the town built at the massacre site			2
the 71 - day standoff that left two tribal members dead and a federal agent seriously wounded is credited with raising awareness about @entity16 struggles and giving rise to a wider protest movement that lasted the rest of the decade			1
scene : this is the site where a battle was fought between the @entity158 and @entity74			0
after the battle ended , there were approximately 300 dead @entity74 and 25 dead soldiers artist impression : a lithograph after a painting of the @entity5 by @entity164 killed : the @entity76 overwhelmed the @entity74 warriors and began shooting haphazardly killing men , women and children of the @entity74 - they also wounded at least 51 price : land owner @entity19 insists the site 's historical significance adds value the land sits on the @entity56 , home to the @entity24 , but many of the descendants of the massacre victims and survivors are members of several different @entity74 tribes , said @entity28 , a former chairman of the @entity29 and a traditional chief			1
@entity28 said the tribes are not in a position to pay millions of dollars for the land			2
although tribal members are not opposed to development that would preserve , beautify or better educate the public about the land and its history , they are opposed to commercialization , he said			2
' you do n't go and dance on grandma and grandpa 's grave to turn a hefty dollar sign , ' he said			0
tribal members and descendants have reached out to president @entity195 to make the site a @entity197 , which would better guard the site against development and commercialization , @entity28 said			0
but even if an outside investor buys the land with intent to develop , there will be obstacles , said @entity206 , an @entity207 member			2
past : a picture of @entity5 on 28 mar 1973			0
it was the site of a violent clash in 1973 between a group of native activists , the @entity92 and @entity213 massacre : @entity13 military authorities awarded twenty troopers the @entity83 for the massacre frozen : ' @entity221 , ' the leader of the @entity74 tribe , lies frozen on the battlefield of @entity5 , @entity11 the tribe could pass new laws preventing the buyer from actually building at the site			1
' whoever buys that is still going to have to deal with the tribe , ' @entity206 said			2
' access is going to be an issue			0
development is going to be an issue			0
i 'm not threatening anybody , but my tone is be aware you have to deal with the tribe if you purchase it			2
' there are nearly 2,500 national historic landmarks across the country , with the vast majority of them owned by private landowners , said @entity244 , chief of the @entity245 and @entity246 in the @entity247 for the @entity248			0
remembrance : members of the @entity92 stand near the @entity251 last month to mark the 40th anniversary of the start of the 71 - day occupation respect : @entity13 @entity74 on the @entity256 arrive at @entity257 n 2007 to remember the 1890 @entity5 massacre gathering : a crowd gathers to mark the 30th anniversary of the @entity92 standoff near the gravesite at @entity5 , @entity11 ' we advocate for preservation and we always express concern about potential harm for their care , ' @entity244 said , adding that the @entity248 does not have any legal authority			1
still , a site can lose its designation if it does not retain its physical integrity , he said			0
one example is @entity274 in @entity275 , which lost the designation when it was remodeled a decade ago because it changed its physical character			0
as for the @entity5 site , @entity244 said any development could potentially affect the @entity281 designation			0
' certainly you would hear a hue and cry about that type of thing , ' he said			0
' and certainly if we saw something going up , we 'd express our concern , even if we do n't have a legal jurisdiction to intercede , we 'd express our concern			0
