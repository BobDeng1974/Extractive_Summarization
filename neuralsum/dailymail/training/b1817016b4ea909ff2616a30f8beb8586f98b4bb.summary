he 's still puffing away on 70 cigarettes a day but the new @entity3 wants to settle down , the author of the latest spy novel has revealed			0
speaking at the launch of @entity6 in @entity7 yesterday , author @entity4 claimed the 007 star is not after casual sex – he wants a relationship			1
and while the old mr @entity3 has always enjoyed a single egg boiled for precisely 3 and a 1/3 minutes for breakfast , mr @entity4 has turned him into a man who prefers his eggs scrambled			2
solo author @entity4 revealed a few changes in 007 's character but said he wanted to keep the character much the same as he was in the past mr @entity4 is the third author to be invited by the @entity20 estate to write an official @entity3 novel , following in the footsteps of @entity23 and @entity24			1
solo is set in @entity26 in 1969 when @entity3 is aged 45			2
@entity3 ’s mission takes him across the continent to @entity26 , which is embroiled in a civil war , and to @entity30 – via a multitude of @entity32 and two different women			1
mr @entity4 , who has written screenplays for films starring the three @entity3 actors , said his book had the ‘ classic ingredients of a @entity3 novel ’ and he had not bowed to pressure to make @entity3 more acceptable to ‘ modern sensibilities ’			1
he said : ‘ times have changed but @entity3 is a heavy smoker , there is a wonderful line in one of the novels , which is @entity3 lit his 70th cigarette of the day			0
‘ i have no desire to water down or make @entity3 more acceptable to modern sensibilities			2
actor @entity51 has starred in the past three @entity3 films but does n't have the right physique to play the agent described in @entity6 according to @entity4 ‘ he drinks , he smokes , he does everything you would expect of a classic @entity3			1
’ and although mr @entity58 is in bed with a beautiful woman by page 86 of the novel , it seems his interpretation of mr @entity3 ’s love life is wholly dissimilar from mr @entity20 ’s			0
when asked who his favourite ‘ @entity65 ’ was , mr @entity4 responded : ‘ i ’m not too keen on the expression @entity65 because i think that @entity3 has relationships with women and i do think he wants a relationship , not just casual sex			0
’ mr @entity4 said earlier this month he had deliberately written about the spy 's relationships with women differently , saying of @entity20 ’s novels : ‘ the sex can veer from terrible @entity77 romanticism to almost sadism			0
’ he also revealed yesterday he had had ‘ discussions ’ with actor @entity51 – who played @entity3 in the latest film - about whether he should write the book			1
but he said - should there be a film made of his book - mr @entity51 did not have the correct ‘ physique ’ for the part of the secret agent , and he would sooner choose film - star @entity89			1
he said : ‘ i think @entity51 is an astonishing actor actually , even though he ’s physically not like the @entity3 described in the novel			2
‘ if there was an actor to play my @entity3 i ’d choose another actor who has been in a film of mine , @entity89 , because i think he actually resembles the @entity3 that @entity20 describes			0
’ he added that @entity20 once described @entity3 as ‘ looking like the @entity30 singer - songwriter @entity96			0
’ fittingly , the book launch was held at the five - star @entity98 in central @entity7 – the venue for the opening of @entity6			1
@entity4 said he had no desire to ' water down or make @entity3 ( played here by actor @entity51 ) more acceptable to modern sensibilities ' in the first chapter of the book , @entity3 heads to the dining room in the hotel on his 45th birthday and orders ‘ four eggs , scrambled , and half a dozen rashers of unsmoked back bacon , well done , on the side ’			1
in @entity20 's novels , @entity3 enjoys boiled eggs from @entity119 hens , boiled for three and a third minutes each , eaten off @entity120 , with toast			0
@entity122 , the niece of @entity3 creator mr @entity20 , said her uncle would have approved of the novel greatly			0
the novel takes 007 into war - torn @entity26 as the 1960s come to an end			1
@entity4 ( right ) follows in the footsteps of authors including @entity131 and @entity132 , who have both written new @entity3 books since the death of his creator , @entity20 , in 1964 speaking at the launch she said : ‘ did you know that breakfast was @entity3 ’s favourite meal of the day ? ’ seven numbered and signed copies of the book were driven off from the hotel in vintage @entity145 cars like the vehicle bond drives in the novel and flown around the world			2
this year marks the 60th anniversary of the publication of @entity20 ’s first @entity3 novel , @entity152			0
