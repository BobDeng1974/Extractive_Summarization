divorcing parents who try to maintain an amicable relationship for the sake of their children are doing nothing to help them , a major study suggests			1
the impact of the split on youngsters is the same whether or not the mother and father keep cordial links , it found			2
the findings undermine a government - backed consensus that the harm caused to children by separating parents can be limited if the couple remain friends			1
the new study , the first in 20 years to examine how the behaviour of separated parents affects their children , was carried out by @entity31 academics			1
it covered 270 parents who were divorced or separated between 1998 and 2004 in an unnamed @entity31 state that compels divorcees to take part in an education programme on ‘ co-operative co-parenting ’			1
of these , 31 per cent considered their relationship with their ex-spouse as ‘ co-operative and involved ’ ; 45 per cent were ‘ moderately engaged ’ with their divorced partner , with some conflict between them ; and 24 per cent said their co-operation was ‘ infrequent but conflictual ’			0
they were asked to say how their break - up had affected the youngest child in their family			1
the average age of children involved was eight years			0
the study , published in the academic journal @entity75 , said that children of divorced parents are more likely than others to suffer ‘ external ’ symptoms such as behaviour problems or drug abuse , more likely to have ‘ internal ’ difficulties like anxiety or depression , and more likely to do badly at school			1
but the researchers , headed by dr @entity86 of @entity87 , found that these children ’s problems were no worse if their parents continued to row and bicker with each other after the divorce cut off : the study undermines a government consensus about divorce which says conflict is the problem the study said ‘ despite the expectation that children fare better ’ if their divorced parents develop a co-operative relationship , the behaviour of children as assessed by their parents ‘ did not significantly differ ’ between the friendly and the fighting groups of divorcees			1
divorced parents should be reassured that their children will not be more seriously harmed if they fail to establish a cordial and co-operative relationship with their former husband or wife , it added			2
the most recent authoritative @entity114 investigation into whether conflict or divorce is worse for children was published in 1994			2
@entity119 ’s @entity118 has produced a guide for divorcing parents called @entity122 which tells them : ‘ it ’s not the separation itself that can cause harm to your children , it ’s the level of conflict that they see or hear between parents			1
this is universally recognised as being very harmful			0
’ the programme was launched in 2012 by @entity136 pensions minister @entity135 , who said : ‘ parents working together is in the best interests of the children , and more collaboration helps minimise the impact of separation on them			0
’ but @entity143 , of the @entity145 pressure group , said : ‘ this study fully exposes the mismatch between parents ’ and children ’s perceptions			2
‘ getting on well might make the parents feel better about their split			0
but it does little for the children			0
to them it makes no sense if the parents get on well yet wo n’t live together			0
the “ good divorce ” is a myth			0

@entity31 study examined 270 parents who split between 1998 and 2004
break - up children more likely to have behaviour problems or drug abuse
but researchers found there was no difference even if the split was amicable
findings undermine government consensus that conflict is the problem
