fearful : popular commons speaker @entity1 dreaded interest in his sexual proclivities the row over claims of an establishment cover - up of an alleged paedophile ring took a new turn last night over fresh claims concerning former commons speaker @entity1			1
when late @entity13 mp @entity12 tried to expose public figures he claimed were involved in a @entity16 child sex ring in the 1980s , @entity1 , who was in the speaker ’s chair at the time , had himself been blackmailed over his homosexuality			1
furthermore , @entity18 has been told of claims that @entity1 , who later became @entity1 , propositioned young men in the speaker ’s official grace and favour apartment in @entity24			1
a senior political source said : ‘ @entity1 had an interest in young men and did not hide it at @entity16			1
’ in the 1960s , @entity1 was a minister in the @entity29 , which is accused of losing over 114 files on alleged child sex cases , including @entity12 ’s dossier in the 1980s			1
and he reportedly used his @entity29 position to help @entity35 leader @entity34 – who was later acquitted of attempted murder of his gay lover – to cover up an alleged homosexual offence against a minor			2
the disclosures follow the announcement of official inquiries into claims of a @entity16 paedophile ring and a @entity29 cover - up			1
@entity1 , who died in 1997 , was one of @entity47 ’s best - loved and most influential public figures as speaker from 1976 to 1983			1
a methodist lay preacher , he was a @entity29 in @entity52 ’s @entity51 and joined the @entity53			1
as speaker , he had unrivalled power , including control of @entity57 debates , security and disciplining mps and even reading the lesson at @entity62 ’s 1981 wedding to @entity63			1
influence : @entity1 ' helped @entity34 , later charged with a plot to kill his gay lover , to cover up an offence against a minor ' close friend and fellow @entity70 mp @entity69 revealed before his death in 2008 that his friend and ally @entity1 lived in constant fear of being unmasked as a homosexual			1
@entity69 , who led the campaign to legalise homosexuality , said @entity1 was blackmailed for being gay and added : ‘ the slightest tremor of scandal , however faintly reverberating into his private domain , reduced him to jelly			1
‘ in 1976 , i found him grey - faced and trembling , ’ said @entity69			2
‘ investigative journalists were pursuing inquiries into @entity34			2
they had reached the conclusion that 16 years earlier , political intervention saved @entity34 from being prosecuted for a homosexual offence against a minor			2
' they believed that when @entity34 became embroiled in another scandal in 1964 , he feared @entity29 records of his earlier misbehaviour would wreck his efforts to free himself			2
’ @entity69 said @entity34 – using his friend , fraudster and @entity35 mp @entity97 , as an intermediary – ‘ turned to @entity1 for help			1
yielding to @entity97 ’s importuning , @entity1 set up a private meeting between @entity97 and the home secretary [ @entity99 ] ’			1
‘ @entity1 was frightened the journalists would be more interested in his own sexual proclivities than in @entity34 ’s , ’ added @entity107			1
' he asked for £ 800 to pay extortioner ... he felt trapped ' @entity70 mp @entity69 , who led the campaign to legalise homosexuality , died six years ago			1
in 2001 , in a book on @entity113 , mr @entity69 revealed how his friend , the former commons speaker @entity1 , was secretly blackmailed for being gay			1
by @entity69 the phone rang at 6am			2
‘ @entity1 here , ’ came a familiar voice			1
it was my friend @entity1 , secret homosexual and – until barely a year beforehand – superb speaker of the @entity123			1
his voice sounded strangulated , and @entity1 was sobbing			1
‘ i ’m in terrible , terrible trouble			2
’ i immediately thought he was phoning me from a police station			2
i feared he was about to be crushed by scandal			2
revelations : @entity70 mp @entity69 was a loyal friend of @entity1 i knew i had to dash to him ; he would panic if there was the slightest sign of a crack in the thin ice upon which he skated all his life			1
@entity1 was 75 and one of the best - known men in @entity47			1
he had been speaker for seven years , an mp since 1945 , @entity29 in the 1960s and secretary of state for wales			1
he was a prominent lay preacher , read the lesson at the wedding of the @entity62 and @entity141 , and enjoyed a warm relationship with the @entity143			2
during his political life , @entity1 could benignly sublimate his inclinations			1
but those inclinations could not always be contained under the fraternal rubric			2
sometimes , overwhelmed , what he regarded as lapses did occur			2
given his exposed position , it was inevitable that he would fall victim to blackmail			2
on one occasion , after a distraught recounting to me of the pressure upon him , i insisted i would meet and deal with the young criminal in his @entity160 constituency into whose hands he had fallen			2
the blackmailing cur had no doubt that , unless he desisted , i would carry out my threat to ensure he was put behind bars for ten years			2
shortly after our encounter , he found it politic to quit the city			0
@entity1 had always been on the edge of catastrophe			1
i learnt he was visiting a grubby cinema in @entity16 where , under cover of the darkness , groping prevailed unchecked			0
i warned him against his lack of discretion			0
alarmed that i had been able to know about his haunt , he thereafter kept well away from it			0
but there were times when my advice had gone unheeded			0
while still a backbench mp , he asked me for a loan			2
the specificity and size of the loan , £ 800 , aroused my suspicions			0
he poured out the story			0
i urged him to let me deal with this extortioner			0
that sum – the ticket and resettlement money which was to take the man to @entity196 – would , @entity1 insisted , mark the end of the affair			1
i had profound misgivings but i could see @entity1 was near breaking point			1
i gave him the money			0
the slightest tremor of scandal , however faintly reverberating into his private domain , reduced him to jelly			0
one such occasion was in 1976 when , summoned to his sitting room in the speaker ’s house , i found him grey - faced and trembling			1
journalists were pursuing inquiries into the then @entity35 leader , @entity34			0
they had concluded that , 16 years earlier , political intervention saved @entity34 from being prosecuted for a homosexual offence against a minor			0
they also believed that when @entity34 became embroiled in another scandal in 1964 , he feared @entity29 records of his earlier misbehaviour would wreck his efforts to free himself			0
@entity34 – using fraudulent @entity35 mp @entity97 , as an intermediary – had turned to @entity1 , then a junior home office minister , for help			1
yielding to @entity97 ’s importuning , @entity1 had set up a private meeting between @entity97 and the home secretary			1
the journalists wanted a probing interview with @entity1			1
he was frightened his motivation in assisting @entity97 was under scrutiny and that the journalists , if denied the interview , would become more interested in his own sexual proclivities than in @entity34 ’s			2
i had noted at funerals and marriages his penchant for using texts from the epistle to the @entity239 ( on the ‘ sin ’ of homosexuality ) – as he would again in the marriage of the @entity62 and @entity141 in 1981			0
i told him he must pull rank and indicate the impropriety of the speaker granting a private interview			1
he took my advice , and regained his equanimity			0
he never again turned to me for assistance – until that poignant early - morning call in 1984 , the year after his retirement			0
it turned out he was not at a police station , as i feared , but in a hospital			0
puzzled and concerned , i rushed to him			0
there was , i knew , a link between his past flights into illness and dangerous threats of exposure			0
once , when he was a backbencher , it drove him into hospital with a bout of shingles			0
sometimes , overwhelmed with praise , his guilt at the encomiums being bestowed upon such a ‘ sinner ’ crushed him			0
( he collapsed at a party given for him at @entity270 to celebrate his 80th birthday			0
) i wondered , as i approached the hospital that dawn , what ghost had visited the haunted man this time			0
before i even arrived , he phoned my wife three times			0
i reached @entity1 ’s bed and found him convulsively sobbing			1
he grabbed my hand and said he was ruined			0
soon the whole world would know that he was in hospital suffering from ... venereal disease			0
i chastened him to get a grip			0
‘ waterworks ’ was the answer , i explained			0
he should allow it to be known he had been rushed to hospital with prostate difficulties			0
@entity1 entered enthusiastically into the tale i had created for him			1
he even sent me , from the hospital , a beflowered ‘ thank you ’ card obviously designed to be shown to my wife			0
it read : ‘ @entity295 , i shall be for ever grateful			0
strangely enough there had been no need for me to worry – it was all in my brain ! i am due for the prostate gland operation next wednesday			0
’ my wife laughed indulgently at his naivety that she would be deceived ; but it helped @entity1 to think so and very soon he was out of hospital – taking , i hoped , the precautions that would avoid his ever again being placed in such a predicament			1
once , after i had saved him from the consequences of some escapade , he could not contain his anger against the homophobic hostilities which had so dogged him			0
with tears in his eyes , he railed : ‘ bust them , @entity295			0
i do not care a damn what is said after i ’m dead but i could n’t stand them taunting me in my lifetime			0
’ extract from @entity69 ’s book @entity113 : @entity321 , @entity322 , 2001 .			2
