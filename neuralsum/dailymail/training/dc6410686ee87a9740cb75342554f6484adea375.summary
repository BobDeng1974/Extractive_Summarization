thousands of @entity1 people with second homes in @entity3 are facing tax rises of 20 per cent as the country ’s @entity6 government targets wealthy foreigners			1
president @entity10 ’s floundering administration wants to use the extra money to raise an extra £ 117m towards its @entity13 budget deficit			1
mr @entity10 ’s employment minister , @entity14 , said some 170,000 homes in @entity16 alone were owned by ‘ rich foreigners ’ who could afford to pay more tax			1
@entity3 president , @entity10 wants to use the new tax to fill a major hole in the nation 's finances but mr @entity14 questioned the fairness of the new charge , saying : ‘ i am mostly against it			1
when we say that we wo n't increase taxes , we should n't increase taxes			2
’ other opponents said it was another example of a desperate left - wing government which views property owners as ‘ lambs to the slaughter ’			0
the so - called ‘ @entity40 ’ would primarily be aimed at those who buy apartments in major cities and then leave them empty for most of the year			0
it will mean an extra 20 per cent on the ‘ tax d’habitation ’ ( habitation tax ) , paid by anyone with property in @entity3			1
the increase will apply to homes which are not primary residences and which have not been rented out in around 30 major urban areas – a status which applies to properties owned by thousands of rich @entity1 people			1
@entity16 is notorious for its empty apartment blocks , with flats only used occasionally at weekends and during holidays			0
the tax d’habitation on a two bedroom flat in central @entity16 is currently around £ 550 a year – a figure which will rise to £ 660			2
@entity3 finance minister @entity58 , pictured , pledged that no new taxes would be introduced in 2015 it is hoped that the rise in charges will put more of the apartments on the rental market , and add to the coffers of local authorities			1
but @entity67 , president of the @entity68 , said the @entity69 had reduced property owners to ‘ lambs to the slaughter ’			0
mr @entity67 said : ‘ it ’s a new craze of this government to tax property			0
it ’s a mistake because it will increase the cost of real estate and punish owners who have worked hard to have a second home			0
mr @entity67 added : ‘ saying this is about freeing up housing is a fundamental error			0
’ mr @entity10 ’s party came to power as an avowed enemy of the rich , proposing a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent , but it has since softened its approach			2
finance minister @entity58 said last month that no new taxes would be introduced in 2015 – a claim which has not been greeted with much confidence			1
there are some 200,000 @entity1 holiday homeowners in @entity3			2
most are in @entity96 , the @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , but flats in cities such as @entity16 , @entity102 and @entity103 are also extremely popular – both as an investment and as a weekend and holiday retreat			0
according to a report in the respected financial newspaper , @entity108 , the new property tax bill will be presented to @entity110 in the coming months .			0

@entity112 needs the extra cash to boost his floundering economy
he is considering a 20 per cent tax hike on all second homes in @entity3
the tax , which will hit thousands of @entity1 , could rake in £ 117 *million*
however @entity10 's finance minister has ruled out new taxes during 2015
