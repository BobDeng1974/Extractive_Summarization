a double killer who knifed his girlfriend and their six - year - old son to death in a frenzied attack will today begin a court bid to inherit their £ 200,000 estate			1
paranoid schizophrenic @entity9 is seeking to exploit a loophole in the law that prevents killers profiting from their crimes			2
but his victims ’ family have told of their torment at the prospect of having to face him across a courtroom again and their anguish at having to relive the tragedy			0
killer @entity9 has launched a bid to inherit the £ 200,000 estate of his victims , partner @entity27 ( left ) and their six - year - old son @entity28 @entity9 , 35 , claims that his mental illness meant that he had not intended to kill			1
he has been granted permission to bring a test case at the @entity32 – and has applied for the case to be heard in secret ‘ in the interests of justice ’ , claiming it would breach his human rights for confidential information about him and his financial affairs to be made public			0
@entity9 stabbed partner @entity27 32 times and their son @entity28 25 times at their home in @entity46 , @entity47 , in april last year			1
his plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted and last september he was ordered to be detained indefinitely in a secure mental unit			1
the landscape gardener has been granted permission to leave the secure unit in @entity56 to give evidence at the hearing at @entity59			2
@entity9 is demanding the £ 150,000 semi-detached home he shared with miss @entity27 , 40 , his son ’s £ 30,000 trust fund and £ 16,000 in joint bank accounts			1
@entity9 is demanding the £ 150,000 semi-detached home he shared with miss @entity27 , 40 , as well as @entity28 's ( pictured ) £ 30,000 trust fund and £ 16,000 in joint bank accounts he claims that because he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he carried out the killings he is entitled to the assets – the proceeds of money inherited by @entity70 – because he was the beneficiary of her will			1
if successful , he could set a precedent for other killers to make a claim because their mental health was impaired at the time of their crimes			0
the @entity80 of 1982 says those convicted of murder or manslaughter can not inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes			0
but there is clause allowing that ban to be waived in exceptional circumstances			0
for example , if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence suddenly retaliates and accidentally kills her partner , she may still be able to inherit his estate			2
@entity97 heard that @entity9 had complained of hearing voices days before the killings and told @entity70 , who worked part - time in a @entity101 store , he was concerned that people thought he was gay			2
miss @entity27 ’s family , who learnt of the @entity32 action just before @entity105 , told in a statement yesterday of their anguish at @entity9 ’s attempt to claim his victims ’ estate			1
‘ to have @entity27 and @entity28 killed in this way is a tragedy we will never overcome , ’ it said			2
‘ but to be faced with the prospect of seeing their killer in court , fighting to inherit money from the two people he stabbed to death , has been too much for us			0
‘ he has nothing to lose from taking this action , but it has caused such torment for us			0
‘ one of @entity27 ’s aunts was going to give evidence but has had to pull out because of the anguish caused by the thought of seeing him			0
‘ she is still distraught and this has brought back the nightmares			1
’ another family member due to give evidence , who does not want to be named , said : ‘ i ’m dreading the idea of going into the witness box and seeing him			0
is it justice that he can stand there in court with the hope of claiming @entity27 ’s estate while we have to sit there with the prospect that he could soon be released to enjoy the spoils of his horrendous crime ? ’ miss @entity27 ’s relatives have been forced to use their savings to fight the case , while @entity9 has launched a claim against them for his legal costs to be paid			1
@entity160 , of @entity161 , who is representing miss @entity27 ’s family , said : ‘ manslaughter is the unjustifiable , inexcusable and intentional killing of another person			1
the usual rule should not be relaxed where the violence was grievous and unprovoked , as here			0
