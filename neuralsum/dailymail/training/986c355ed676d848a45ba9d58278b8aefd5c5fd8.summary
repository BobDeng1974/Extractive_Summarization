by @entity0 and @entity1 they have been a bleak part of the @entity5 skyline for half a century			2
but as part of the @entity11 £ 10million opening ceremony , five of the city ’s tower blocks will be demolished			1
as organisers yesterday proudly unveiled their plan , it was slammed as ‘ crass and insensitive ’ and ‘ a spectacle on the cheap ’			2
the 15 - second stunt to be screened around the world stands in stark contrast to the triumphant opening to the @entity20 in 2012			1
five tower blocks which have been part of @entity5 's skyline for almost 50 years will be blown up as part of the @entity11 opening ceremony six of the original eight tower blocks remain after two earlier demolitions , one in 2012 and one last year ( pictured ) conservative @entity5 councillor @entity28 , whose mother grew up in the flats , said : ‘ there has been no consultation about this , it is a few cultural bureaucrats thinking this sounds like an arty idea , but it is a very odd decision			1
‘ people watching in developing countries with substandard housing will not understand why these high - rise buildings are being blown up			1
‘ this is not the positive vision of @entity5 we should be portraying			0
’ sir @entity47 , former @entity48 leader and ex @entity11 athlete , whose father oversaw construction of the flats , said : ‘ it seems a really curious way to celebrate			2
’ @entity57 , author of a book based on the flats ’ residents added : ‘ it is crass and insensitive in the extreme			2
‘ it ’s ignoring the thousands of people who had lived their lives there and their memories of the place			0
’ the sixth tower , currently occupied by asylum seekers , will be demolished by 2017			2
@entity20 opened with @entity72 and @entity73 parachuting into the @entity74 - now bosses of @entity71 plan own explosive opening by blowing up five tower blocks the @entity20 began with a bang as billions tuned into the spectacular @entity78 a performance at the stat of the @entity82 2012 games which saw hundreds of dancers take to the stage the summer ’s explosions will create 50,000 tons of twisted steel and rubble which will take years to be cleared away			2
a @entity5 2014 spokesman described the event as a ‘ bold and dramatic statement of intent from a city focused on regeneration ’			1
but organisers admit that if there are safety issues , the demolition will be cancelled depriving the @entity11 of its opening ceremony showpiece on july 23			1
the blocks ’ final few moments will be beamed live into the ceremony at @entity102 on a giant 100 - metre screen , as well as to an estimated tv audience of more than one billion people around the world			2
almost 900 homes near the site will be temporarily evacuated during the event and their residents invited to join in the opening celebrations at local venues			1
@entity113 , independent director on the @entity5 2014 board and chair of the ceremonies , culture and @entity72 ’s baton relay committee , said : ' by sharing the final moments of the @entity120 with the world as part of the opening ceremony of the @entity11 , @entity5 is proving it is a city that is proud of its history but does n’t stand still			1
residents from the flats where three asylum seekers died in june 2010 in a triple suicide march in support of asylum seekers ( file photo ) ' a city that is constantly regenerating , renewing and re-inventing itself			2
' @entity5 ’s story is always one of its people ; their tenacity , their genuine warmth , their ambitions			0
marking the end of @entity120 is very much a celebration of all of those things			1
' when they were built between 1964 and 1969 , the @entity120 flats were the highest in @entity143 at 292ft ( 89 metres )			1
they were designed to accommodate 4,700 people , but lately far fewer people remain there after decades of the properties slipping into decline			0
@entity120 resident @entity150 , 21 , said the tower blocks have been like family to him since he moved to @entity5 three years ago			1
the student said : ' they have been a family to me , that 's how i would describe it			0
' it 's been a great experience and they will be missed			0
the area will be entirely different after they 've gone			0
but they have been here for 60 years or something and it was time to get them demolished anyway			2
' when they were built between 1964 and 1969 , the @entity120 flats were the highest in @entity143 at 292ft ( 89 metres ) the @entity120 flats have housed many asylum seekers over the years and the community was horrified by the deaths of a @entity172 family who jumped from their block in march 2010			1
@entity175 , 43 , his wife @entity176 , and his 19 - year - old stepson @entity177 had apparently had their application to remain in the @entity180 refused			2
campaigner @entity181 said : ' for the @entity183 , they light a torch , and here in @entity5 , they are celebrating the start of the @entity11 by blowing up the @entity120 flats			1
' it 's highly insensitive and jars with the senses			0
many of the sportsmen and women in the @entity11 games from other countries may well be claiming asylum here , as so often happens , because of the threat of torture or denial of certain freedoms over there in their own countries			0
' the @entity11 committee clearly thinks it 's a great idea to blow it up but clearly has no concept of the misery the @entity120 flats caused to thousands of people from @entity5 and across the world			1
' the director of @entity210 in @entity211 said the @entity120 flats were a ' place of despair ' and should never have been built			1
demolition of the five skyscrapers will be part of the curtain raiser to the largest sporting and cultural event @entity220 has ever h games organisers believe the live blow - down will ' serve as an unforgettable statement of how @entity5 is confidently embracing the future and changing for the better ' , while being a ' respectful recognition and celebration of the role the @entity120 flats have played in shaping the lives of thousands of city families ' who lived there			1
in 2006 , director @entity231 used the flats as the setting for her @entity235 - winning film @entity120			1
and in 2007 tightrope walker @entity236 attempted to walk ninety metres above the ground on a thin metal wire stretching between three of the tower blocks , although due to unpredictable winds he was not able to complete the walk			0

it will be a ceremony like no other , showcasing our city ’s unique style and personality and with our people and communities at its very heart			0
we are going to wow the world , with the demolition of the @entity120 flats set to play a starring role			1
' @entity120 has an iconic place in @entity5 ’s history , having been home to thousands of families and dominating the city ’s skyline for decades			1
their demolition will all but mark the end of high - rise living in the area and is symbolic of the changing face of @entity5 , not least in terms of our preparations for the @entity11			1
' @entity283 , head of ceremonies and artistic director for @entity5 2014 , said : ' over the course of just a few seconds the city ’s skyline will be transformed forever			2
' it ’s a bold and confident statement that says ‘ bring on the future ’ , but it will also be an important opportunity for us to contemplate the many lives lived in the tower blocks over the last 50 years			0
' @entity220 ’s @entity11 minister @entity294 said : ' for many people , these @entity11 are more than sport , they are a chance for regeneration , renewal and having better places to live and work			0

now the @entity120 estate is a dumping ground for asylum seekers			2
@entity5 's @entity120 housing estate epitomises the failed council housing policies of the 1960s which saw communities torn apart and moved into huge , impersonal tower blocks			2
glaswegian comedian @entity312 compared the peripheral estates to ' deserts with windows '			0
when they were built between 1964 and 1969 , the steel - framed buildings - some up to 31 storeys high - contained 4,700 people and were the tallest residential blocks in @entity143			1
council tenants in @entity5 's notorious tenement slums swarmed on to waiting lists to move into the spacious new flats on the estate			0
but the rot soon set in			0
the first lifts failed in the 1970s			0
then the graffiti artists arrived			0
the 1980s brought chronic drug dependency and spiralling crime			0
@entity330 handed two blocks with the worst reputation to the @entity333 as part of an effort to improve the area			0
in 2005 @entity337 announced its intention to demolish one of the tallest blocks as part of a regeneration plan for the area			1
regeneration is well underway with new housing developments and the demolition process of the flats ongoing			1
