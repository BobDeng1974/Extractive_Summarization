you ca n’t take the city out of the boy and , as far as @entity3 is concerned , you ca n’t take the boy out of the city either			1
the rising cross-over star of the @entity8 ring — from @entity10 idolatry to appreciation on mainland @entity8 , from the hardcore boxing audience to multi-million viewership on mainstream terrestrial television — is so grounded in @entity15 that he is considering back - tracking on his recent move with his young family to a farmhouse outside his home town			1
‘ it ’s a bit of a handsome place but when we look out of the window across the fields there ’s not another house to be seen , ’ he says			2
@entity3 poses with @entity28 's @entity27 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) in a @entity31 gym @entity3 will defend his @entity34 super-bantamweight title against @entity35 in @entity15 a week on saturday @entity3 pictured using the sauna as he undergoes the final stages of his preparation to take on @entity39 @entity3 says he was easily picked on in the streets because he was ' short , small and had big ears ' they call ‘ yer man @entity3 ’ @entity44 but this is an urban animal : ‘ i ’m a @entity15 lad to my bones			1
’ @entity3 is talking as he prepares to headline the return of boxing to our major broadcast networks , @entity51 having picked him as the exciting reason for turning back to the sport for the first time in the best part of a decade			1
he defends his @entity34 super-bantamweight title against @entity35 , a typically tough @entity58 , on saturday week in @entity15 ’s @entity59 , which has become a steaming cauldron for his exploits			1
satellite transmission from @entity15 will be beamed live not only across the @entity64 but also to another 54 countries , the @entity62 included			1
@entity3 ’s fame will grow worldwide if , as expected , he comes through this mandatory commitment and moves on to world championship unification battles with @entity70 ’s @entity69 in @entity71 , and then @entity73 sensation @entity72 in @entity62			1
but no matter how much success he enjoys , it will be the same unspoiled young man who will celebrate by going out for a pint with his pals			0
@entity3 greatly admires @entity79 as the best pound - for - pound boxer on earth but says : ‘ you wo n’t see me buying a fleet of @entity84 or a private plane			1
i ’ll never change , famous or not			2
i ’ll never be too big for my boots			2
for one thing , my wife would n’t let me			0
nor would @entity15 , where being flash quickly gets you disliked			1
a lot of them go back to schooldays			0
we ’re all working - class boys			2
‘ the tough neighbourhood i come from is a big part of what has made me a world champion			2
the first punch i threw was probably at my brother , @entity101 , when we were kids			0
i had my first sparring session in the gym when i was seven			0
@entity3 's bout with @entity35 will be broadcast on @entity51 and across 54 countries , including the @entity62 @entity3 ( left ) is put through his paces by @entity107 ( right ) , the son of promoter @entity29 @entity3 has been training in @entity29 's gym in @entity31 as his preparations for the bout intensify @entity3 says that his upbringing in a tough neighbourhood has contributed to his mentality and success ‘ i had to learn how to handle bigger guys			1
i was easily picked on in the streets because i was short , small and had these big ears			1
’ that @entity119 ’s @entity118 of @entity15 is a hardline @entity120 stronghold and @entity3 grew up within the bullet - holed walls left behind by the @entity122			1
he knows that had he not punched his way out he could have gone the wrong way			0
‘ in a place like that it ’s all too easy to do one stupid thing when you ’re drunk , make that one mistake which puts you the wrong side of the law			2
’ not to mention fall prey to prejudice			0
in a mirror image of his manager and mentor , legendary ex-world champion @entity29 , @entity3 is helping heal that sectarian divide			1
@entity29 , a @entity138 , married a @entity120			0
@entity3 ’s bride @entity139 is catholic			2
fighter and manager have harnessed the two communities , rallying them into a united body of support whenever they climb through the ropes			0
such defiance of historic enmities requires the kind of courage demanded of any man entering the professional ring but @entity3 defers to @entity29			1
he says : ‘ @entity29 was fearless			2
had to be , back then			0
it ’s easier for me , @entity15 is a better place now			2
there are more mixed marriages			0
’ @entity3 is crossing boxing ’s social divide , too			1
he says : ‘ one of the pleasures for me is that not only are there are folk of all persuasions among my fans but wives and girlfriends insist on the men taking them to the fights			0
many of them bring the kids too			0
’ that was evident when @entity3 beat @entity170 to win his world title in a 20,000 - seat pop - up arena erected in the dramatic setting of the @entity175 shipbuilding yards			1
but it is within the enclosed , reverberating , 9,000 - ticket confines of the @entity59 that his support is at its most deafening			1
@entity3 takes justifiable pride in saying : ‘ honestly , this is the biggest atmosphere for any sporting event in @entity182 now — the rugby , hurling and gaelic football included			1
’ @entity3 ( left ) stands alongside @entity29 ( right ) who is his manager and mentor @entity3 is going to defend his @entity34 super-bantamweight title against @entity39 @entity29 believes that @entity3 now has the ability to surpass his won achievements in boxing @entity28 's @entity27 ( left ) spoke to @entity3 ( right ) about his preparations for the impending fight with @entity35 the frenzy will be cranked up by @entity62 ’s ‘ @entity193 ’ ring announcer @entity193 , and @entity195 ’s former world heavyweight champion @entity194 is flying to join the party as one of @entity51 ’s commentators			1
there are loud echoes here of the old @entity202 in which @entity29 fought his way towards featherweight glory			0
@entity29 expects his protege to surpass his own achievements , saying : ‘ @entity3 now has the physical strength , the punching power , the speed and the brain to become one of the greatest @entity64 boxers of all time			1
’ the full package is cemented by the work ethic which @entity29 impressed upon @entity3 as being vital to any plan for conquering the world			2
‘ the point came when i realised i had to improve my attitude , ’ @entity3 confesses			1
‘ i had to get real serious about boxing			2
luckily i love the sparring			0
not all boxers do but it ’s my favourite part of training			0
the running and some of the other stuff can be boring but i like nothing better than practising what i do			0
’ more than a hundred rounds of sparring have gone into preparing him to meet @entity35			1
most of them against bigger , heavier men			0
many , unusually , without the protection of a full headguard , about which he says : ‘ i do n’t feel comfortable in the crash helmet			0
’ this core toughness of the natural - born fighter is drawn from his upbringing , so much so that he does not regard the hardest game as especially rigorous			0
‘ if boxing and me had n’t found each other i might have been out on the oil rigs , going to war in the army , maybe in a gang			2
i ’ve never had to think about any other job			0
if i had , who knows what would have become of me ? @entity3 is preparing to take on @entity39 ( left ) at @entity15 's @entity59 @entity3 greatly admires @entity79 but does n't quite possess his flash lifestyle the 27 - year - old says promoter @entity29 was fearless back in @entity15 but it is now easier for him ‘ i ’m grateful to boxing			1
so if me getting on to mainstream television proves to be good for the sport , that ’ll be great			1
’ we are in the gym in south @entity195 where a wall has been decorated in boxing idiom by a @entity261 artist who paints murals with his hands			0
there is enough space for a ring and a minimum of necessary equipment but they are moving to larger premises soon , as the stable presided over by @entity29 and his son @entity272 , @entity3 ’s trainer , keeps growing			1
there is room at the moment for a sauna in which @entity3 catches up with his family on a mobile phone while sweating out a head cold so that he can resume sparring			2
his weight is never an issue since he is rarely , if ever , more than a few pounds over the super-bantamweight 8st 10lb limit			0
nor does he take any opponent lightly			0
‘ @entity69 keeps calling me out , and maybe we will do that next , but i expect @entity35 to be a harder fight			1
and although @entity72 is the best in the world i want him sooner rather than later			0
’ the latter of those fights could be built into a blockbuster in @entity293 , @entity294 or @entity295 but @entity3 does not want that process to take too long			2
he celebrates his 28th birthday on saturday and says : ‘ unlike some boxers ( such as the 50 - year - old @entity299 ) i do n’t intend to go on fighting for ever			1
we want enough to live comfortably but lots of money is not on my agenda			0
my ambitions are all professional			0
i would like to become the undisputed world champion , then go up to win titles in at least one more division			0
i hope that would carry me into the boxing @entity309			0
‘ then it would be time to repay my wife for putting my career before her own			0
time for me to take over looking after our daughters so she can go back to work			0
’ @entity3 knocks down @entity170 during their @entity34 super-bantamweight world title bout in september @entity3 would like to fight @entity69 and @entity72 , the latter of which possible in the @entity62 @entity139 is a lawyer and was embarking on a career in criminal justice before marrying @entity3 and giving birth to @entity322 , now four , and nine - month - old @entity323			1
before @entity3 quits the ring he will put it to his wife that moving the family back into the city might be more convenient for her to resume her profession			1
once the @entity15 boy , always the @entity15 boy			2
@entity330 live on @entity331 on saturday , february 28 , preceded by the undercard on @entity333 .			1

@entity3 preparing for fight with @entity35 in @entity15
@entity337 will be live on @entity51 on saturday , february 28 at the @entity59
@entity3 is the rising cross-over star of the @entity8 ring
