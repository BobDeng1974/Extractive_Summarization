by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 14 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:00 est , 14 december 2013 tragedy : an inquest has been launched into the passing of @entity6 , 44 , examining whether her death could have been caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump the catchphrase ‘ in better control			1
’ appears again and again on the @entity12 website			2
it is the pharmaceutical company ’s clever marketing strategy to promote their insulin pumps – medical devices often thought of as a foolproof alternative to the daily injections of lifesaving drugs needed by diabetics			1
yet last week , an inquest was launched into the death in her sleep of financial journalist @entity6 , 44 , with the family ’s legal team examining whether it could have been caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump			1
a year before , a 26 - year - old woman , known only as @entity29 as she wishes to remain anonymous , claims to have suffered a massive overdose after her pump released a large amount of the drug insulin into her bloodstream			1
she spent two days on a life support machine and lay in an induced coma for a further two days , but has since recovered fully			2
in may , a week after @entity6 ’s body was found , the @entity37 ( @entity39 ) watchdog sent out a warning regarding the device after the manufacturer discovered some to be faulty			1
problems identified included mechanical faults that could result in too much insulin being released – a potentially life - threatening overdose – by accident			1
@entity12 , who make the @entity50 pumps , one of the most popular brands – models of which were used by both women – say their products were not at fault in @entity58 ’s case			2
they tested her pump and found it to be fully functional			1
human error is a known cause of overdose with all methods of taking insulin			1
the cause of @entity6 ’s death is yet to be determined by the coroner			1
but lawyer @entity69 , who is representing both the @entity6 family and @entity29 , says known problems may predate these incidents			1
on april 2 this year , @entity12 sent an ‘ urgent recall ’ letter to all @entity76 users of @entity50 pumps , warning them that malfunctions with the device might lead to overdose			1
in july , @entity81 regulators the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) followed suit after @entity12 admitted similar faults with the devices there			2
‘ @entity89 illness ’ resulting from overdose was highlighted as a potential risk			1
under investigation : @entity6 was using a programmable insulin pump administering it continuously through a catheter into her body warnings are usually triggered when doctors or , more rarely , patients report back to manufacturers , or directly to the relevant regulators , that they are having problems with a device			1
@entity69 is concerned by the delay in issuing a @entity104 warning and the fact that it was not an urgent recall as had happened in @entity76 a month before			2
‘ we are worried that @entity104 patients may still not be aware of serious issues with these devices			0
’ people with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin of their own , which is a problem because insulin controls the body ’s absorption of sugars , or glucose			1
this leads to dangerously high levels in the blood			0
synthetic insulin is taken to control this problem			1
insulin pumps are portable devices , about the size of a pack of cards , which stay connected to the body and deliver insulin from a reservoir via a cannula ( tube ) placed under the skin			1
they are programmable , allowing the user to modify the amount of drug they receive at any given time , which could be while sleeping			0
there are currently about three million diabetics in @entity104 , with ten per cent of those diagnosed with the type 1 form			0
in type 2 diabetes , the most common form , the condition is often controllable – and even reversible – with diet and tablets			0
for those with type 1 , injections of insulin are the only treatment option			1
typically , one daily injection provides a slow - acting background level of insulin , with additional fast - acting doses given with a separate injection ‘ pen ’ before or after eating or drinking			1
before : a traditional insulin pen the major problem with the treatment is the risk of hypoglycaemia ( very low blood - sugar levels ) if too much of the drug is taken			2
often called ‘ a hypo ’ , typically patients experience shakes , sweating , hunger , palpitations and mood swings due to not enough glucose being available for use by cells throughout the body			0
this is unpleasant but can usually be corrected by consuming a high - sugar food , such as a glucose tablet , fruit juice or sweets			0
but if blood - sugar drops for a longer period or sharply , patients can lose consciousness			0
this is considered a medical emergency , as the condition can be fatal			0
just a few too many units of insulin given at any one time can be enough to trigger an episode			2
insulin pumps eliminate the need for multiple jabs and , according to studies put forward by manufacturers , also reduce the likelihood of hypos			2
children – who may forget or misjudge amounts to inject – as well as those who are very active or lead erratic lives , meaning they miss meals , and those with extremely difficult - to - control diabetes are usually considered candidates for a pump			2
according to diabetes.co.uk , six per cent of adults and 19 per cent of children with type 1 diabetes use one			0
however , they are not foolproof			0
the @entity82 has reported 17,000 cases of health problems linked to insulin pumps made by manufacturers including @entity12 , @entity12 , @entity215 and @entity216 , all of which distribute in the @entity104			2
in some cases human error is to blame , but just how many incidents are related to mechanical faults is unclear			0
@entity58 suffered an overdose of insulin in may 2012 after her pump released insulin into her bloodstream while she slept			1
she suffered convulsions which woke her boyfriend , who called an ambulance			0
@entity58 initially sent her pump back to @entity12 for analysis			2
they wrote to her in april this year claiming there were ‘ no anomalies ’ with the device			0
she says : ‘ essentially , this implied it was my fault , not theirs			0
it made me very , very angry			0
if i had been sleeping alone , i would n’t be here now			0
’ @entity69 , a partner at @entity240 solicitors , adds : ‘ their letter to @entity29 fails to flag up the known problems in other countries			0
it was only after our own investigations that these malfunctions came to light			0
it seems strange that they did not mention the @entity76 urgent recall that happened in the same month			0
’ a spokesman for @entity12 said : ‘ patient safety is our top priority			0
we are committed to ensuring high - quality standards of manufactured products to support them in their daily diabetes management			0
‘ every day hundreds of thousands of customers use the @entity261 in order to seek better control in their diabetes management			0
‘ we have not been contacted by any investigating authority or had the opportunity to examine the insulin pump ms @entity6 used			1
due to this and to patient confidentiality , we are unable to comment on the circumstances that led to ms @entity6 ’s death			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity39 said : ‘ our priority is to ensure that patients have acceptably safe medical devices and we take prompt action to address any safety or performance concerns			0
’ @entity6 ’s older brother @entity279 is not reassured			1
he says : ‘ if @entity6 ’s death was caused by a failing pump , the manufacturers need to take them off the market to ensure no other family ever has to go through the pain and misery that we are suffering			1

@entity6 , 44 , is *suspected* to have died from an insulin overdose
she was using an insulin pump which her family believe was malfunctioning
