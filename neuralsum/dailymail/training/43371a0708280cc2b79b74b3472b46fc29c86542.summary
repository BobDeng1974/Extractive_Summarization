the @entity9 youngster swept the ball home during a goalmouth scramble after @entity6 goalkeeper @entity14 's punch failed to clear the danger from a 43rd - minute corner			2
despite controlling much of the possession , @entity6 's @entity17 could n't find a way back into the contest in gale - force winds and driving rain by the @entity23 in north - west @entity2			2

it was a scrappy opening at the @entity98 , with @entity50 midfielder @entity99 enjoying the best chance when his free - kick flew over the crossbar			0
at the other end , @entity2 had their best chance when @entity44 played through @entity42 , only for the @entity43 teenager to fire just wide of the right - hand post			0
@entity46 did hit the target for @entity2 just after the half - hour but was denied by an offside flag			0
the hosts were handed a massive let - off just before half - time when their keeper , @entity24 , parried the ball straight out to @entity68 's @entity77 who conspired to shoot wide from just five yards			0
@entity6 's @entity66 competes for the ball with @entity48 ( right ) of @entity2 during the contest @entity6 's @entity79 attempts an acrobatic effort during the match at the @entity98 @entity6 coach @entity93 ( left ) chats to his @entity2 counterpart @entity118 conditions deteriorated in the second half as heavy rain made it difficult for the players to gain a foothold and this thwarted @entity6 's attempts to get back into the game after @entity0 's scrambled goal			1
@entity6 threw on @entity84 's @entity33 , @entity43 's @entity86 and @entity47 's @entity87 as they searched for the equaliser but it did n't arrive			0
