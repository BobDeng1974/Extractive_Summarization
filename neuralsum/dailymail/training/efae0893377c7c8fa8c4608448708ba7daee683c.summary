less than a week after a video seemingly showing men trying to take advantage of a drunken woman on @entity7 was revealed to be a hoax , the actress who took part in the marketing ploy issued an apology			1
@entity10 , a 24 - year - old @entity11 - based actress and model , took to @entity13 tuesday saying that she had been led to believe that she will be taking part in a ' light - hearted prank ' when she was hired to portray a drunk girl			1
' had i known the damaging outcome of this video , i never would have participated , ’ @entity16 said			2
' ‘ so , from the bottom of my heart , i am very , very sorry for my participation in this production and any harm it may have caused , ’ the striking brunette said into the camera			0
the ' @entity23 in @entity25 ' video was posted on @entity13 november 11 and quickly became a hit with people across the internet expressing outrage at the several sober men who came up to the actress - who was pretending to be intoxicated while staggering down @entity7 - and tried to coax her back to their homes			1
just two days later , one of the men who appeared in the video came forward to reveal that the whole thing was staged by a viral marketing company and they were just following prompts from directors @entity64 , 20 , and @entity66			2
and when one of those men posted on @entity69 to express his anger that he had been portrayed as a predator , one of the filmmakers tried to silence him with free drinks and the promise of future work			2
the real ' drunk girl ' : the woman in the video is a 24 - year - old @entity11 - based actress and model , who goes by the nickname ' @entity40 ' setting the record straight : @entity16 said that she was hired to take part in what she had been told was a ' light - hearted ' prank truth comes out : the striking brunette said that all the men featured in the video were ' perfect gentlemen ' the video follows 24 - year - old model @entity10 as she pretends to be seriously intoxicated , walking down @entity7 and asking men for directions to the bus stop that will get her to @entity96			1
shockingly , of the five men featured , only one actually offers her assistance , while the rest attempt to lure her back to their homes - despite her obviously drunken state			1
two sources told @entity104 that men in the video were approached on the street and asked to participate in a ' comedic , hidden camera ' video			2
one man who decided not to appear in the video , says he was told it was a ' student video ' and that it appeared they had no releases or paperwork to sign			2
@entity116 is one of the men who agreed to participate in the video and is filmed in a blue tank top , telling the tipsy woman : ' you 're in no shape to be walking around like this ' before leading her in the direction of his home where there is ' more beer '			2
@entity116 , pictured right , said he was asked to participate in what he thought was a student video , in which he followed the direction of its creators in the video , he is interrupted talking to the woman by another man who also then tries to take advantage of her but both mr @entity116 and his boss deny the film 's authenticity , saying he was just trying to help the student filmmakers out			1
@entity143 is the owner of @entity144 , a company which arranges nightclub crawls , and she said mr @entity116 worked selling tickets to tourists			0
he was wearing a tank - top advertising the business when he was approached by the video 's creators on the street to ' say a couple of lines for a comedy sketch			1
' ' they made it seem like he was trying to take the girl home , ' she said , adding that her business does not ' condone such behavior			0
' mr @entity116 has also spoken out about the video on @entity69 , writing that it ' was all staged and all of the people in it were acting '			0
the first man ( pictured ) tries to lure @entity10 back to his apartment with the promise of a water bed			0
but the authenticity of the film has now been called into question after those who appeared in it say they were told they were acting in a student video the video ' does not portray myself or any of the other people in it correctly , ' he said , adding that it 's a ' false a * * portrayal and i was lied to about what the video even was			1
faulty a * * * shit			0
' after publishing the post , he says he received a private @entity69 message from mr @entity66 who tried to convince him to keep quiet			0
' the important thing to consider is that this video is going to get you well known and have a future with us and our company , ' he allegedly wrote			0
' we are going to be huge and you are part of it , ' mr @entity66 also said , before inviting him out for a night of free drinks			0
' just go with it dude , you are in our team now and we will take care of you			0
' mr @entity66 himself appears unconcerned about the latest claims			0
last tuesday , he boasted on @entity69 about the video 's success and to say he was leaving @entity11 for a few days and will be ' creating some more viral videos for your viewing and learning pleasure '			1
' i just want to help you ' : the video showed another man trying to get the young woman into his car in the video , only one man ( pictured ) offered to help the woman find her bus stop			1
