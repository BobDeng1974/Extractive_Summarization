by @entity0 published : 04:15 est , 8 march 2014 updated : 08:03 est , 8 march 2014 two friends who got gastric bands together after getting fed up of their size 20 plus figures ended up being nicknamed ‘ little and large ’ after the surgery had an opposite effect			1
@entity8 , 46 , dropped to a size six after her gastric band was fitted as opposed to best friend @entity11 , 38 , who remained a size 24			1
they decided to take action after over two decades of friendship they slowly ballooned in size until 5ft 4ins @entity8 became a 16 - stone size 20 and 5ft 9in @entity11 was a 20 - stone size 24			1
@entity20 , left , lost a lot of weight after her gastric band was fitted while @entity11 , right , remained a size 24			1
they have both since had their bands adjusted and are now both at their ideal weight best friends @entity20 and @entity11 both decided to have weight loss surgery after they ballooned to size 20 plus they both kept trying diets without success and with her 40th birthday close @entity8 decided to take drastic action			1
inspired by her friend , @entity11 also booked in to have surgery and a month later they were lying in side - by - side hospital beds in @entity38			1
but that ’s where their paths diverged			0
while @entity8 then lost so much weight she went down to a six - stone size four and was labelled anorexic , @entity11 did n’t lose a single pound			1
mrs @entity8 said : ‘ we ’d always been fat together so it was awful when i ended up so thin			1
we got called the @entity48 and large show			0
’ only now , six years later , have they finally achieved the figures they always wanted			0
procurement manager @entity8 has gained weight and sales manager @entity11 has finally shed some of hers			1
mrs @entity8 added : ‘ there were times when we questioned what the hell we had done			1
it ’s been a bumpy ride but neither of us regret it because we got here in the end			0
we supported each other through it and now we love finally being slim together			0
’ the friends met at work in 1991 and with matching appetites for fatty , sugary foods they went shopping together for goodies to eat at their desks			2
the pair , who have been friends for two decades , took action after their weight crept up , left			1
they are now enjoying their new slimmer sizes , right , and spend weekends going shopping for new clothes mrs @entity8 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , said : ‘ every lunchtime we would hit the supermarket with a trolley			1
it looked like we were shopping for a party but it was just our lunch and afternoon snacks			0
‘ we would eat huge meals and desserts			0
for lunch we would have a huge filled baguette , a bag of crisps and some chocolate or biscuits			0
’ every afternoon they snacked on treats including chocolate minstrels , flapjacks , cookies , dairy milk bars and babybel cheeses			0
but they hated being fat , felt guilty , and vowed to change their unhealthy ways			0
ms @entity11 , from @entity113 , said : ‘ over the years we tried every diet going together			1
we ’d lose a bit of weight then our love of food would take over and we ’d start scoffing treats again			1
’ when @entity8 was 39 they were living and working in different areas , but still remained best friends			1
she recalls : ‘ @entity122 was still our favourite topic			0
but i did n’t want to be fat at 40 so told @entity11 my surgery plan and was n’t surprised when she followed suit			1
’ mrs @entity20 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , pictured before her weight loss , decided to have the gastric band fitted before her 40th birthday @entity20 , pictured after her weight loss , is much happier now she is a size 10 - 12 @entity8 , left , is now a healthy size 10 - 12 while @entity11 , right , has dropped seven stone to a size 14 with the operation likely to cost them £ 10,000 each in the @entity135 , they went abroad where the price was £ 4,000			1
the night before the surgery in @entity139 they pigged out at a @entity141 restaurant			2
ms @entity11 said : ‘ it felt like the last supper because we both knew we would never be able to do it again			1
’ the next morning @entity8 was first into theatre for the two - hour operation and the friends spent two days recovering before flying home			1
in the first two weeks @entity8 lost half a stone eating tiny amounts of pureed food			1
but @entity11 did n’t lose anything			1
she said : ‘ i was n’t too worried at that point			0
everyone is different so i hoped i would catch up			0
’ over the following year @entity8 lost three stone but @entity11 was still struggling			1
ms @entity11 said : ‘ i did n’t feel envious			1
@entity8 was proof that it could work and i just needed to get mine right			1
‘ she could barely eat half of a plate of food but i could still polish off the lot			0
’ @entity8 , pictured , who is now a healthy size 10 - 12 , is happy with her figure after dropping six stone to celebrate their new figures , the best friends booked a glamourous photo shoot to show off their new bodies by the time @entity8 had dropped to a size 12 @entity11 had gone back to @entity38 for new surgery to adjust her band			1
afterwards her weight finally started to fall off			2
but @entity8 was still losing pound after pound even though she ’d passed her target			1
after treating herself to a whole new size 12 wardrobe , in the year that followed it started to swamp her frame and soon she had to wear a tiny size six			2
she said : ‘ i was trying to eat more but would just bring it back up and kept losing more weight			2
i bought a size eight outfit before i went on holiday , and when i returned two weeks later it drowned me			2
i had lost another stone in that fortnight			2
‘ it got to the point where i could only eat tiny amounts of food and even that would leave me in pain and being sick			0
i reached a size four and looked anorexic			2
@entity8 , left , dropped to a size six after her gastric band was fitted too tight			1
she has since gone back to a healthy size 10 - 12			2
@entity11 , right , lost seven stone after her band was also adjusted ‘ i hated it – i looked old and haggard			1
people kept asking me if i was ill. i knew they meant with an eating disorder			0
‘ my husband @entity206 had been so supportive all the way			0
when i told him i wanted the surgery he said it was my decision and he would back me			2
but when i lost so much weight he was really worried			2
’ eventually @entity8 ’s boss insisted she go to hospital for a check - up and it was later confirmed that her band had slipped , meaning she was n’t absorbing any nutrients and had become seriously malnourished			1
‘ it was made even more difficult because my surgeon was in @entity38 so i could n’t keep nipping back to see him , ’ she said			0
‘ when i was admitted to hospital here the doctors had to speak to my surgeon in @entity139 so they could work together to solve the problem			0
’ she had a new operation to correct the problem and was told to keep eating until her weight reached a healthy range			2
she said : ‘ it was fun being able to eat what i wanted again			0
i was so relieved when my bottom and bust started to fill out again			0
’ eventually she reached 10 stone and a size 10 - 12			2
she said : ‘ my wardrobe was stuffed with everything from size 20 to size four			2
’ while @entity8 was regaining weight @entity11 , who is single , had dropped to 13 stone 12lbs and a size 14 and was finally happy with her figure too			1
she said : ‘ we went from being two fatties to @entity48 and @entity241 and now we both feel fabulous			0
it was n’t exactly the quick answer we hoped , but we could n’t be happier now			0
’ mrs @entity8 added : ‘ instead of bonding over our love of food , now we bond over our love of clothes and shopping			2
‘ every time we see each other we hit the shops			0
unless you have been overweight you do n’t understand what it feels like now to be thin			0
it has boosted our confidence no end			0
‘ it is amazing just to be able to go out and buy what you want and wear what you want for the first time ever			0
we have both gone from wearing black shapeless things and leggings to buying nice colourful dresses , even bikinis for holidays			0
‘ i love shoes and have more than 300 pairs but even my shoe size has dropped from a 7.5 to a 6			2
i need to have a good clear - out to make room for some more			0
’ to celebrate their slimming success , the pair booked a glamorous photoshoot - something they would never have dreamed of before their surgery			0
ms @entity8 said : ‘ i booked it as a surprise for @entity11			1
it was a real treat and we giggled all the way there and back pretending to be famous			0
‘ having the surgery really has changed our lives for the better in the end			0
