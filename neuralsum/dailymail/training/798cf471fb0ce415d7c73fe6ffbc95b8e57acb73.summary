by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 , long - time coach of @entity3 when she played , illustrates her character by telling of the surprise that awaited him when he got back from holiday after the season when she made it to world no 1			1
‘ it was in 2004 , we were at the @entity16 and there was a very nice car i saw on the street , an @entity20 , ’ he recalled on monday at the @entity12 , where he is now guiding @entity14 @entity13			2
‘ she did n’t say anything at the time but at end of the year i was on holiday and she called			2
i was in @entity26 , she asked when i was coming back and told me she was coming to the airport to pick me up			2
she came with this same car to give me because she was no 1 in the world			2
she had found it for me			0
’ many who know her intimately — and @entity2 is among her closest confidants — speak of a thoughtfulness that is combined with an excellent tennis brain			0
appointment : @entity35 , pictured training at @entity37 , has appointed @entity3 as his new coach top job : the two - time @entity41 winner will take over in time for @entity37 's understanding : @entity2 used to coach the former world no 1 @entity3 this combination has swayed @entity35 to hire her			1
‘ when she is commentating on tv she says good things , sometimes the guys do n’t get it right but all the time she says the right things , ’ added @entity2			2
‘ what i like very much is that when she decides on something , she goes to the end			0
some people you can not talk to , but she is sensitive emotionally			0
‘ she is very clever , maybe for @entity35 ’s team it will be different at the beginning but they are generous and will fit very well			1
‘ maybe she and @entity35 should play mixed doubles together , that would be great ! ’ ' excited ' : @entity35 said @entity3 was someone he ' always looked up to and admired ' @entity60 : @entity3 won @entity61 in 2006 and the @entity62 in the same year something the teetotal @entity35 will not have in common with his new coach is her passion for wine			1
when she won @entity61 in 2006 , @entity3 gave herself a long - awaited treat — buying a bottle of 1921 @entity68			1
but the signs are that the pair will gel better than she did with @entity71 , despite the fact that she was on her compatriot ’s team when she won @entity61 last year			0
it appears that the extrovert @entity71 , who relishes a high profile , grated with @entity3 , who is much more private by inclination			1
‘ we were not compatible , ’ she revealed			0
@entity3 has been publicity shy ever since she came out as gay at the @entity81 , something that happened with a fanfare she subsequently regretted			1
hurtful things were said during that tournament , such as @entity85 describing playing her as like facing ‘ half a man ’ because of her impressive physique			0
previous : @entity3 already has experience of coaching man , having worked with @entity90 exit : @entity35 lost to @entity92 in the semi-finals of the @entity94 in @entity95 for someone with a reserved nature who comes from a traditionally - minded family based just north of @entity95 , the whole experience was not enjoyable			1
on several occasions she has said she found being in @entity103 more relaxing than being in her home country — and that becoming the first world no 1 in a nation where tennis is massively popular brought an unwelcome focus			0
some who know her well from @entity14 tennis believe that the biggest obstacle to her forming a successful partnership with @entity35 may be how she copes with the pressure			1
she arrives this morning at @entity116 to begin work and the attention will be fairly relentless until her new client finishes his @entity61 campaign			0
@entity35 has factored all this in and does not believe it will be a difficulty — not even the logistics of @entity3 being unable to enter the men ’s locker room			1
‘ obviously you ca n’t sit down and chat in there , but there ’s enough places where you can chat			0
the players ’ lounge is pretty large , ’ he told the @entity126			0
laugh : @entity135 @entity134 joked about @entity136 or @entity137 becoming a coach to a male tonic : @entity35 will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of @entity92 ‘ normally i speak about tactics the night before my matches and then 20 , 30 minutes before i go on court when i ’m normally in the gym anyway			1
i do n’t see any problems in that respect			0
’ few know @entity35 better than @entity149 , the @entity150 doubles player who is tournament director this week			1
he pointed out that his close friend has a long history of picking coaches through innovative hunches , rather than looking at their experience			0
@entity149 also ventured that @entity3 will be given full responsibility for guiding his career : ‘ i ’d imagine that she will be the boss			2
in most sitiuations the head coach will be leading the show , organising the team			2
i believe @entity3 will do that but ultimately it is @entity35 ’s call about how much control she has			1
‘ i think she ’ll be very smart , it ’s not like she ’s someone who is incapable of running his team			0
’ @entity134 had a typically irreverent reaction to the appointment , however , telling @entity171 last night : ‘ i am waiting for a couple of good - looking tennis players to also quit tennis so that i can also have a new coach			2
‘ @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity176 maybe			0
who would make the better coach ? ’ contact : @entity3 said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks long term : @entity3 suggested the pair would team not just on a short team basis			1

*mauresmo* has been appointed as @entity35 's new coach
@entity35 has been without a coach since splitting with @entity188
@entity3 will take up her new role in time for @entity37 's
