at 22 inches tall , @entity8 is perfect house pet size , and barely as big as his best friend , his owner ’s black labrador , @entity10			1
as a result he enjoys all the comforts of home			0
@entity8 , now aged three , was born with dwarfism , caused by a recessive gene which only affects a foal when it is carried by both of the parents			1
she said : ‘ we imported his dad from @entity45 and put him with our @entity45 mare and they must both have been carrying the dwarf gene – he was the result			2
‘ due to dwarves having various health issues most breeders would have put him down , but little @entity8 was so full of life and otherwise healthy , it was never an option			1
‘ one day we were in the living room and he just wandered in , we were really surprised			0
my little pony : @entity33 with @entity8 , who she could n't bear to put down - despite his potential health problems walkies ! thanks to his size , @entity33 can simply take @entity8 for a walk on his lead in the nearby fields horse power : the horse , believed to be @entity73 's smallest , can even fit into the family car for a run out stable of pals : @entity8 sniffs at a treat with his best friend , @entity10 the black labrador in @entity33 's kitchen ‘ when he comes in he loves to watch the television , he just stands there staring at it			1
he likes to walk around and sniff everything so now we let him come and go when he wants			0
’ although he is more than welcome to wander around the house , @entity8 does have his own traditional stable at the farm			2
but it does cater for his size with the tiniest of stable doors so he can see out onto the yard			0

’ @entity99 : though @entity8 has the run of the house , he also has his own traditional stable at the farm cuddles : @entity8 gets close to @entity33 as she takes him for a spin on the back of a golf buggy around the farm wait for me ! the diminutive horse has to trot to keep up with @entity33 as she takes him for a walk on his lead unusual : @entity8 , now aged three , was born with dwarfism , caused by a recessive gene carried by both parents			1

three - year - old @entity8 was born with dwarfism , caused by a recessive gene
