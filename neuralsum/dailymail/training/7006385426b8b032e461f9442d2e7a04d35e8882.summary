@entity7 was forced to retract his first - ever column for @entity9 , but his huge mistake on a tax story was made more odd by the fact he already has a @entity13 for financial reporting			1
mr @entity7 has admitted his piece for the top news agency - in which he claimed @entity18 ’s @entity17 got a $ 4.8billion tax refund for the past four years - was ‘ 100 per cent dead wrong ’			2

the mistake was highlighted by @entity44 of @entity45 , who pointed out @entity17 has been using negative numbers to report outflows , rather than tax inflows , since 2007			0
successful : mr @entity7 's huge mistake was made more odd by the fact he won a @entity13 for financial reporting in 2001 at the @entity25 mr @entity7 , who teaches at @entity52 in @entity53 , realised that @entity17 had in fact paid the $ 4.8billion sum in cash for corporate income taxes between 2007 and 2010			1
‘ i will do all i can to make sure everyone who has read or heard secondary reports based on my column also learns the facts and would appreciate the help of readers in that cause ’ @entity7 he said he did not know about the switch in convention for reporting positive and negative numbers because he missed a note on @entity69 of the company ’s annual report in 2007			1
