@entity2 's departure from the @entity93 is the latest humiliation in a tumultuous fall from grace that began when allegations over the speeding penalty surfaced early in 2011			1

mr @entity57 had tried the stay the proceedings as an abuse of the court process of the court , claiming police investigations had not been ‘ thorough , rigorous and conscientious ’			0
he also appealed to the judge to consider the difficulties @entity2 faced due to the passage of time , lack of documents and negative publicity			1
he said @entity2 could ‘ not sensibly ’ be expected to remember the events of 2003 and that key documents ‘ demonstrative to the truth in a fundamental respect of this case ’ were no longer available			1

mr @entity49 rejected the applications to dismiss the charges saying it was his judgement that ‘ there is a case to answer ’			2
