@entity189 @entity188 said : ' with an inevitability of war approaching and a shortfall in soldiers , @entity190 authorised an increase in the army of half a million men in august 1914			2

at the outbreak of war in 1914 , many young men were quick to enlist into the @entity3 - spurred on by a desire to serve their country , or simply to avoid unemployment			1
by the end of september 1914 more than 750,000 men had joined up - many of them as part of ' pals battalions ' from the same workplace , football team or friendship group			2
however , within a year of @entity17 's declaration of war in august 1914 , it became obvious that the country would not be able to continue fighting with just voluntary recruits			0
although the famous ' @entity283 ' poster helped encourage more than one million men to enlist by january 1915 this was not enough to cover the rising number of casualties and the government decided there was no choice but to bring in conscription - compulsory active service			1
the @entity293 became law in march 1916 and imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41 , other than the medically unfit , teachers , clergymen and certain industrial workers			2
conscientious objectors who opposed fighting on moral ground were also spared the draft , as were those living in @entity304 , and men called up could appeal against the call up at a local @entity307			0
married men were subject to conscription following the passing of a second @entity293 in may 1916 , and in 1918 a further law raised the age limit to 51			2

however , if they expressed a preference to join the @entity322 then it had first refusal on whether to take him			0
throughout the war around 2.5 million men joined the @entity327 through conscription , with 1.1 million of them joining during the first year			2
