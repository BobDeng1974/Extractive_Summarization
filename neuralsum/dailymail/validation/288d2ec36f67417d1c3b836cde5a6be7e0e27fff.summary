here 's the bad news for @entity1 : despite the camouflage we can see what you 're wearing at the @entity6 on thursday			1
the 37 - year - old @entity7 turned heads at the @entity10 event by wearing an ostentatious blue and pink camouflage jumper , and in the process added to golf 's long list of crimes against fashion			1
@entity1 has arguably the most famous hair in golf thanks to his insistence on being one of the few players not to wear a sponsored cap , leaving his carefully - coiffed mane on view at all times			2
@entity27 got a fine view of the do when @entity1 claimed a brilliant victory by beating the 14 - time major champion at the 2012 @entity32			2
@entity1 shows off his camouflage jumper at the @entity6 in @entity34 @entity35 hits his tee shot on the 11th hole on his way to a two - over - par round of 74 rock is still visible against the trees at @entity42 despite his camouflage but , sadly , neither the hair nor the jumper could inspire a better score than 74 - two over par - in the first round at @entity42 in @entity34 on thursday			1
that left the @entity50 man nine shots behind the leader , @entity52 , with three rounds to go after the @entity54 's opening 75			0
rock is far from the first offender when it comes to golfers breaking the laws of fashion			0
there are too many examples of awful golfing attire to list here , but among the chief culprits are loud - mouthed and loud - trousered @entity67 @entity66 , numerous @entity69 teams down the years and , of course , the not - so - shrinking violet , @entity72			0
here is a taster of some of golf 's fashion hall of shame ... big - hitting @entity67 @entity66 has an infamous collection of loud and proud golf trousers @entity27 , @entity80 and @entity81 show off the awful shirts of the 1999 @entity67 @entity69 team @entity72 wore his claret jug trousers ( left ) for the @entity85 in 2005 and the @entity87 pair in 2004 @entity88 wears his garish all - orange outfit on sundays and as a tribute to his alma mater , @entity91 ( left ) ; @entity92 wears a horrific tartan jacket ( right ) , but to be fair to the @entity94 it was his ( rather dubious ) prize for winning the @entity96 tournament at @entity97 in 2013 @entity98 shows off during @entity85 at @entity99 in 2008 ( left - no prizes for guessing his nationality ) ; and what do you ink about @entity106 's octopus - print pants at the @entity107 ? @entity108 and @entity109 wear matching pink tank tops at the @entity69 in 2005 oh , and if you want to wear the @entity111 look yourself , visit @entity112 and get ready to shell out Â£ 130			1
good luck trying to get your local members ' club to let you on the course , though ...			0
