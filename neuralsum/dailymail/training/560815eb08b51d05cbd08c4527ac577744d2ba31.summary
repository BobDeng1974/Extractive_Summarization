by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter shamed @entity4 drugs cheat @entity5 has made good on his promise to take the fight against his historic ban to court			1
the suspended slugger filed a lawsuit monday in federal court against both @entity13 and the player ’s union seeking to overturn his banishing for the 2014 season			1
the lawsuit also made public the entire 33 - page decision made by arbitrator @entity19 after a series of contentious hearings between @entity5 , the league , the player ’s union and @entity25			1
a man of his word : @entity5 vowed saturday in a statement to take the fight to federal court ‘ we recognize the standard to overturn an arbitration is a high one , ’ attorney @entity32 , part of @entity5 ’s legal team , told @entity35			1
" but we think this proceeding was so flawed from beginning to end , including obvious bias from arbitration @entity19 in favor of @entity13 , which is put forth in our complaint			1
' the suit comes only one day after ’ @entity48 ’ aired a shocking interview during which mr @entity25 admitted to personally injected steroids into mr @entity5 , directing his doping regimen and even drawing blood from him in a @entity54 nightclub bathroom stall			1
‘ given the intense public interest in this matter and commissioner @entity62 's disclosures last night on ' @entity48 , ' it 's difficult to imagine that any portion of this proceeding should be under seal , ’ @entity56 district judge @entity55 said during the hearing			0
‘ mr. @entity5 is directed to file his unredacted complaint with the attached exhibits , ’ he added			2
the third baseman ’s legal team had originally brought a redacted lawsuit ‘ in an abundance of caution , ’ according to mr @entity32 , who said mr @entity5 and his lawyers were afraid of running afoul of the collective bargaining agreement between the players union and the league			1
out in the open : the lawsuit comes only one day after @entity25 spilled the beans to ' @entity48 ' ‘ we 're perfectly content to unredact and file the entire complaint , ’ mr @entity32 continued			1
@entity82 lawyer @entity81 unsuccessfully argued in favour of the redacted complaint , saying ‘ the [ union ] believes that those matters should stay confidential , that is , the decision and the underlying proceedings			0
’ ‘ we 're thrilled , ’ said mr @entity32			0
‘ we want the entire record to be public			0
we want everyone to be able to see exactly what @entity25 said			2
’ @entity5 legal team frontman @entity92 had to participate in the hearing via telephone , @entity35 noted , but @entity95 picked up right where his co-defense council left off last night on ’ 60 minutes			1
’ ‘ the introduction of triple , quadruple hearsay , inauthentic documents , documents that were stolen not once , but twice that were presented out of order , that were presented in incomplete fashion that @entity25 could n't even identify - all of this was relied on without question by ( @entity19 ) , ’ mr @entity32 griped			2
mr @entity5 ’s team was denied access to the actual @entity107			2
‘ @entity13 had two experts that were allowed to examine those @entity107 with unfettered access			2
we did n't get one , ’ mr @entity32 continued			0
no refuting : @entity13 coo @entity112 told ' @entity48 ' that @entity5 never tried to defend himself against mr @entity25 's allegations during the arbitration hearings that resulted in the 162 - game ban the lawyer then bashed mlb commissioner @entity62 for talking to ’ 60 minutes ’ but not testifying during the hearing , which famously caused mr @entity5 to storm out in a fit			1
‘ one thing that was very interesting was whenever we had discussions on ways to resolve this , @entity13 was adamant that they wanted 162 games , ’ said mr @entity32			0
‘ @entity126 and behold , where did this decision come out ? it is all in the complaint			0
’ @entity13 chief operating officer @entity112 was quick to point out that the 14 - time all - star never testified during the arbitration hearings in his own defense , he never tried to refute mr @entity25 ’s claims			1
the ballplayer claimed in a statement issued shortly after the suspension was announced that the arbitration process was unfair and that the deck was stacked against him			0
running out of options : @entity5 has no where else to turn should this lawsuit not go his way ' this is one man 's decision , that was not put before a fair and impartial jury , does not involve me having failed a single drug test , ' the former mvp said			2
the league will almost certainly call him to the stand during the upcoming civil trial – and he can be asked about anything , including steroids , human growth hormone and whatever else he may have ingested			0
the only way mr @entity5 is likely to get his suspension overturned is by testifying under oath or submitting a sworn document he did n’t take the drugs he is accused of taking , a @entity160 legal analyst said			0
should he go that route and be found guilty of taking the banned substances , the next chapter in this saga would be a criminal trial			0
the player fans deride as @entity172 will finally have his day in court either way , but the truth may set him free or see him locked up .			0
