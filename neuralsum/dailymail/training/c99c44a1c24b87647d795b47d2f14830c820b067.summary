by @entity1 reporter published : 17:28 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 18:14 est , 20 august 2013 as a star of @entity5 ’s oldest television soap , he has been involved in some dramatic storylines			0
but it is clear that @entity9 ’s life off - screen is equally colourful			1
the gay actor , who plays midwife @entity12 in @entity13 , has spoken of how he became a father of two after making a pact with his straight female friend @entity17			1
modern family : from left @entity19 , @entity9 , @entity17 and their daughter @entity22 they agreed that if she did n’t find her ‘ mr @entity27 ’ by the time she was 40 they would embark on parenthood together			1
thrown into the equation is mr @entity9 ’s partner @entity19 , 49 , with all three sharing the responsibility of raising @entity22 , four , and two - year - old @entity31 , who were born by @entity32			1
mr @entity9 , 40 , said : ‘ i always wanted to be a dad			2
when i came out to my parents as a teenager , their only concern was i might never be a father and they knew how much i wanted to be			0
‘ @entity17 and i had the conversation i ’m sure thousands of women have with their gay friends , a sort of plan - b pact – to have a child together should mr @entity27 not appear			1
i ’d had other female friends ask me and it never felt right			0
but with @entity17 it did			2
’ mr @entity9 said he was lucky his family were supportive , as were miss @entity17 ’s			1
he joked that the 45 - year - old actress ’s father had heard a similar story on @entity52 , which had helped his understanding of what his daughter was doing			1
miss @entity17 said : ‘ i was never one of those women who saw a baby and thought “ i want one ” , but i also knew i did n’t want to not have children			1
‘ when @entity9 first brought up the subject of having kids together i was n’t opposed to the idea , but it was n’t how i wanted to do it			2
‘ i still had hopes of @entity67 appearing in a shaft of light and told @entity9 to come back when i was 40			2
then i turned 40 and mr @entity27 still had n’t materialised , so it started to take on more meaning			0
i could n’t shake the fear that i might hit 50 and regret not trying			0
strong figures : @entity9 , right , with partner @entity19 attending a @entity74 in order to raise awareness of homophobic bullying in schools last year ‘ we had both been single when we discussed this , but then @entity9 started seeing @entity79			1
it was clear if we were to go ahead , @entity79 would need to be involved			0
and so there were three			0
’ recalling their visit to the @entity32 clinic , miss @entity17 said it was ‘ surreal – we were the only threesome in a waiting room of couples ’			1
it took a year and four cycles of @entity32 before the first positive pregnancy test			1
although miss @entity17 , mr @entity9 and mr @entity19 initially moved in together , they now live separately			1
mr @entity9 said the children spend half their time with him and mr @entity19 at their home in @entity98 , @entity99 , and the rest with miss @entity17 , who lives nearby			1
mr @entity9 said the only negative response appears to have come from a couple of gay friends , with ‘ one accusing us of trying to fit into some kind of heterosexual stereotype ’			2
in his professional life , he has been involved in a ‘ gay dad ’ storyline			0
mr @entity9 joined @entity13 in 2007 as @entity12 , boyfriend of barman @entity110 , but left after three years to spend more time with his daughter			1
he was tempted back to the @entity114 soap last year to feature in a story where they looked after @entity110 ’s son @entity117			0
but in recent months viewers have seen @entity12 fall in love with @entity120 , the character ’s first heterosexual relationship			2
in the interview for @entity125 magazine , miss @entity17 , who has appeared in @entity127 on tv and also works in the theatre , admitted the hardest part for her was dealing with the unexpected loneliness her circumstances brought on			2
on screen : pictured here in 2012 as midwife @entity12 alongside co-stars @entity135 , as @entity136 , left , @entity137 as @entity138 , right , and @entity139 as @entity120 ‘ it felt like i spent the first 12 weeks of my pregnancy holding my breath , ’ she said			2
‘ and i found it surprisingly lonely			0
@entity9 and @entity79 had each other to bounce fears off , but i was on my own			2
@entity9 was supportive , but it was n’t the same			0
those first months were harder than i anticipated			0
but we ’ve all had our moments			0
‘ @entity9 is the middleman , so he has to placate two people			0
and @entity19 sometimes felt isolated because , biologically , it was happening to @entity9 and me			1
‘ towards the end of the pregnancy we agreed it made sense to be living together : practically , so we could all be hands on ; emotionally so we all felt involved			0
’ mr @entity9 added : ‘ something i realised early on is that i ’ll never be the one who feels compromised : i ’m in a relationship with @entity19 and i ’m the biological parent with @entity17 , so my position is clear			1
‘ @entity17 is single , so she does n’t have someone to talk to about the kids in the way @entity79 and i do			0
’ for mr @entity19 his modern family set - up is a marriage with three people			1
‘ or at least it ’s like a friendly divorce , where the kids split their time between two homes ! ’ he said			0
‘ it works well , though			0

@entity9 , who plays @entity12 , made pact with friend @entity17 to be parents together
after four rounds of @entity32 she became pregnant with their *eldest* @entity22 , now four , followed by two - year - old @entity31
the pair and @entity9 *'s* partner @entity19 , 49 , share joint responsibility for both children
