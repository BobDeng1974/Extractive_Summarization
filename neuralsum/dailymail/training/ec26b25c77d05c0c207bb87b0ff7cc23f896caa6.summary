the baboon jumped in to claim the comfy seat ahead of tired walkers hiking near @entity8 in @entity9			1
instead of moving off when they approached , these photographs show one particularly brazen one just sucking its finger in defiance			0
favourite bench : a @entity17 baboon reclined in the sun at @entity8 and decided he was n't going to budge @entity20 monkey : he impolitely began sucking his finger as tourists try to coax him off the seat unruffled : the baboons at @entity8 are very used to tourists so they could not be shooed away it presented the perfect photo opportunity for 33 - year - old tourist @entity29 from @entity30 , @entity31			1
she had just been climbing up a steep path leading to the famous waterfalls when a group of @entity17 baboons ran across her			2
she said : ' i was wondering where all the baboons were , as i had been told there would be many			2
' all of a sudden a troop of about 15 came out of nowhere			0
their territory : none of the baboons felt inclined to move , however much the weary tourists wanted to sit down keeping an eye out : the baboons wearily watched the tourists move away from their patch extreme relaxation : overwhelmed by the head of the summer months , this baboon just lay flat out on the path there were babies and their mums , juveniles , and adults			1
the young ones were running around and playing			0
' a large adult lay down right on the pathway blocking my way and then another climbed onto the bench			0
he just sat there owning it			0
' baboons at @entity8 are famously very bold			1
in the past they have reportedly stolen and other items from unwitting tourists			0
watchful : a baboon eyed up the hikers , clearly waiting for them to leave on the look out : eventually the tourists left the baboons to enjoy their domain in peace			1

baboons *hogged* the seating areas as weary tourists looked for somewhere to sit at @entity8 , @entity9
