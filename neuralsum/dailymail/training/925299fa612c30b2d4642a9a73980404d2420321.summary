by @entity0 for @entity1 a surgeon has rendered a patient infertile by giving him a vasectomy when he went into hospital for a minor operation			1
the patient was the victim of what hospital chiefs have called a ' never event ' - a medical mistake that should never happen			1
the man , who had the original procedure at @entity14 in @entity15 earlier this year , has been told that an operation to reverse the vasectomy was unsuccessful			1
he could now be entitled to more than £ 100,000 in compensation			2
the urology department at @entity14 ( pictured ) , part of the @entity22 and @entity21 , has admitted the error was just one of five botched operations - and two ' never events ' - in the last 12 months it is understood that the surgeon who performed the surgery has since been fired , according a report			1

another mistake involved a medical swab being left inside a patient during an operation			1
the @entity42 ' apologised unreservedly ' to the man when details of the mistake , which they termed ' wrong site surgery ' , emerged earlier this year			2
the vasectomy - and the failed reversal - means that the patient will not be able to conceive naturally			0
@entity49 , clinical negligence lawyer at @entity51 , said the vasectomy patient could be eligible for more than £ 100,000 in compensation , but it would depend on how old he is and whether or not he has been left infertile			2

( @entity59 image ) mr @entity49 said : ' this is a truly shocking and worrying case			0
from what we know there has been a catastrophic breakdown in procedure , as simple checks designed to ensure the correct operation is carried out on the right patient seem to have failed			1
' if a 25 - year - old who wants a family is told he wo n’t be able to father children , it will be devastating			0
' hospital bosses say the blunders have been reported to @entity77 chiefs and that investigations are under way to establish how they happened			0
dr @entity80 , medical director at @entity22 and @entity21 said : ' our urology department is the biggest in @entity83 and @entity84 , caring for over 4,000 patients a year			2
' the vast majority of feedback from these patients is overwhelmingly positive			0
' we have excellent , highly regarded clinical teams who treat the most difficult urological cases , many of which are referred to us by other hospitals for our expertise and leading edge surgical techniques			0
' in the last 12 months , three serious incidents and two never events occurred in our urology department and these were reported to the appropriate bodies			1
' we are still in the process of investigating some of these incidents , including looking at how to improve the processes and systems in place and are taking appropriate action			0
' we can not comment on the outcomes of these investigations at this stage			0
' patient safety is always our priority and we use the lessons learnt from any incident to continually improve our standard of care			0
