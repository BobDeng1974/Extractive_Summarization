by @entity0 published : 12:30 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 15:19 est , 16 october 2013 a half - tonne rock , suspected to be a meteorite , has today been pulled out of murky lake in the @entity4 , @entity5			1
experts believe it may be part of a meteor whose ground - shaking shockwave hurt 1,600 people in @entity5 in february			1
the dramatic recovery operation came eight months after a piercing streak of light lit up the morning sky in the central @entity5 region of @entity16 in scenes some locals said made them think of the onset of a nuclear war			1
much of the meteor landed in a local lake called @entity34 that the divers entered in an operation covered live on @entity5 television			1
live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5 - metre - long ( five - foot - long ) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special casing while it was still underwater			0
the bolder was then pulled ashore and placed on top of a massive scale for the all - important weighing - an operation that quickly went partially wrong			0
a meteor fireball , pictured , crashed into @entity5 in february , it was part of a 656 - feet wide asteroid called 2011 @entity52			1
@entity54 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and claim it came from the @entity59 asteroid that regularly crosses passed earth as it orbits the sun a meteor that blazed across southern @entity4 in february was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century			2
more than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion , estimated to be as strong as 20 @entity68 atomic bombs , as it landed near the city of @entity16			2
the fireball measuring 18 meters across , screamed into @entity72 's atmosphere at 41,600 mph			0
much of the meteor landed in a local lake called @entity34			0
other than the latest find , scientists have already uncovered more than 12 pieces from @entity78 since the february 15 incident			1
however , only five of them turned out being real meteorites			0
the rock broke up into at least three large pieces as scientists began lifting it from the ground with the help of levers and ropes			1
the scale itself broke the moment it hit the 570 - kilogramme ( 1,255 - pound ) mark			2
‘ the rock had a fracture when we found it , ’ one unnamed scientists told the lifenews.ru website in a live transmission			2
‘ it weighed 570 kilogrammes before the pieces fell off			0
and then the scale broke , ’ said the scientist			0
‘ we think the whole thing weighs more than 600 kilogrammes , ’ he said			0
experts cautioned however that it will take time before scientists can certify that the rock they pulled from the lake had indeed come from outer space			2
the @entity112 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from @entity78 since the february 15 incident			2
@entity16 , 900 miles east of @entity116 and close to the @entity118 border , took the brunt of the impact the station cautioned that only four or five them turned out being real meteorites			0
the meteor fireball that crashed into @entity5 in february was part of a 656 - foot wide asteroid called 2011 @entity52			1
the fireball measuring 18 meters across , screamed into @entity72 's atmosphere at 41,600 mph			0
in august , @entity130 satellites made the unprecedented measurements of the meteor which is thought to have released 30 times more energy than the atomic bomb that destroyed @entity68			0
@entity54 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor that were scattered across the @entity5 town of @entity16 , where the meteor landed , and claim it came from the large @entity59 asteroid that regularly crosses passed @entity72 as it orbits the sun. they added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused by the gravitational pull of the planets and the sun , or could have been caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit			1
satellite data from @entity130 has revealed that that four days after the bolide explosion , the faster , higher portion of the plume ( red ) had snaked its way entirely around the northern hemisphere and back to @entity16 in @entity5			1

*enormous* rock was found in the murky @entity78 in the @entity4 , @entity5
experts believe it is part of a meteor that hit @entity16 eight months *ago*
the rock broke up into at least three large pieces as scientists tried to lift it
