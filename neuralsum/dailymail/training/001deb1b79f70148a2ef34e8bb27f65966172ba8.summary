' guilty : @entity70 @entity2 , 27 , now faces life in prison without parole after a jury in @entity75 , @entity26 found him guilty of murder on tuesday			1

' it 's huge to know that everybody - not just @entity88 and not just people in the @entity91 - people all over the world [ are ] in support of it , ' he said			2
@entity2 was unemotional as he was found guilty of the two murders on tuesday evening , little more than two hours after the jury started deliberating			2
