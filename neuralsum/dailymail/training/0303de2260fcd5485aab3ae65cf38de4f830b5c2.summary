as the @entity5 mother , acting in @entity1 or debating life on @entity3 , @entity0 has always had a special place in the nation 's heart			1
in the @entity10 issue she talks openly and frankly about her battle with stage four colon cancer and explains how she made the difficult decision to cease having treatment			1
' from the start i told @entity18 i did n't want to hang around if things got too bad			1
a few months ago i felt that time had come , ' explained @entity0			1
i knew from the beginning the long - term prognosis was not good , but i was prepared to give it my best shot			2
' now i feel the cancer is winning and rather than keep on fighting it , i have decided to stop the treatment that is keeping me alive			1
my time will be shorter – i 'll live a couple of months if i am lucky – but it will be much happier for me and my family			1
' @entity0 , who was a panellist on @entity3 and starred in the @entity5 adverts in the 1980s , has weeks to live ' i have always tried very hard not to cry in front of the family			1
i know that if i stay positive , they will too			2
but one night in august i was in such agonising pain down my left side that i could n't stop the tears			1
' the illness had gone to another level and i did n't feel like myself any more			2
it 's the little things that get to you : the mouth ulcers , the tiredness ... the difficulty of dealing with a stoma bag			2
' it was the progression of her disease and the increasing side effects , as well as the bleak prognosis , that has prompted her decision to stop treatment in november – which she hopes will give her one last @entity26 feeling as normal as possible			1
@entity0 says her biggest sadness is leaving husband @entity18 , who she married in 2008 the actress , who received an obe in march this year , is determined that people understand her decision , but not feel sorry for her ' my decision has taken such a weight from my shoulders , and the sense of relief means i can enjoy things again			2
as i 'm very well aware , life is too short and nothing is going to stop me enjoying myself while i can			1
' after november there will be no more chemo			2
we [ her husband @entity18 ] both know that once i stop treatment , i will have around eight weeks left			1
' at the time , we just held each other and cried			1
but it was such a relief to say the words			2
the scariest thing about this disease is that you no longer feel in control			0
this is my way of taking back control			0
i 'm not giving up , just being realistic			0
' read the full @entity0 interview in the november issue of @entity10 the actress , who received an obe in march this year , is determined that people understand her decision , but do not feel sorry for her			0
' i want my family to remember me at my best : laughing , fighting , being theatrical			0
not hobbling around in pain			0
' i do n't believe in bucket lists			0
what 's the point of spending all the money in the coffers and leaving everyone penniless when i 'm gone ? but i do have one important last wish – a lovely final @entity26 with my family			1
' what i want everyone to remember is that i 'm 66 , i 've had a fantastic life and i could n't really wish for more			0
' i 've thought about my funeral and chosen my favourite hymns but at the end i want to cut through it with @entity114 singing there 's @entity116 , before everyone gets too weepy			1
' her biggest sadness is leaving husband @entity18 , who she married in 2008			0
' it 's a tragedy that having met this amazing man and been given a third chance at love – after two cock - ups ! – we 've only had 10 years together			0
it 's not long enough			0
' we 've both worked hard so that we could travel more and have a lovely life when we retired			0
i feel that i 've let him down			0
