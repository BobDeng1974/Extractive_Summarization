ever wondered what it 's like to be a fish , bird or horse ? well , the wait is over			2
a range of immersive helmets that let you see the world though different animals ' eyes , such as a chameleon ’s , have been created			0
the metal devices use optical tricks to enable people to experience the hyper - stereo vision of a hammerhead shark , or the 357 ° view of a horse running in the @entity20			1
the helmets first went on display at the @entity37 of @entity29 in november and are now at the @entity38 in @entity39 until february			1
@entity40 and @entity30 were inspired to make the helmets after exploring the pioneering experiments by psychologist @entity43 in the early twentieth century			2
he wore specially adapted glasses that inverted images up and down and left and right for over a week and discovered that the human brain could adapt to these new conditions			0
@entity29 artists clearly @entity30 have spent years developing a series of hand - crafted aluminium helmets which explore ‘ the mysteries of visual perception			1
’ here , an individual tries on the horse helmet , which effectively puts their eyes on the side of their head so they can experience the 357 ° view as if they are a horse @entity40 and @entity30 were inspired to make the helmets ( an illustration is pictured ) after exploring the pioneering experiments by psychologist @entity43 in the early twentieth century the @entity29 artists ' helmets are inspired by the work of @entity43			1
in an experiment conducted in the early to mid 20th century , he wore specially made glasses that turned the world upside down and swapped left and right			0
he did this for a whole week and slept with a blindfold on to ensure that his vision did n't revert to normal			0
while the experience was initially unpleasant and disorientating , within a few days , the scientist 's brain learned to make sense of the visual information			0
astonishingly , after a week , he said that his upside - down world felt relatively normal , indicating his brain adapted relatively easily to the changes			0
the animal helmets are designed to make wearers question why humans see the world as we do and why our vision is so limited , while animals see their surroundings differently			0
this is achieved by using carefully set up mirrors inside the helmets to direct the light into a person ’s eyeballs			1
they work in a similar way to a periscope to achieve a desired effect , such as allowing someone to see backwards , or an elevated view , without raising their head			2
the ‘ @entity109 ’ give humans the opportunity to experience the hyper - stereo vision of the hammerhead shark , so it is as if their eyes are spread much further apart			2
in 2009 , scientists discovered that despite the shark 's distinctive head shape , including its protruding eyes , the animal actually see like a human using binocular vision , but with added benefits			0
the predator also has stereo vision to enjoy a sweeping view of its surroundings , far superior to that of humans			0
these ‘ @entity109 ’ give humans the opportunity to experience the hyper - stereo vision of the hammerhead shark ( pictured )			2
its wide set eyes allow the shark to see 360 degrees , which enables it to hunt prey such as squid that are able to propel themselves swiftly in any direction while the hammerhead shark ( stock image ) has a large blind spot in the centre of its field of vision - in front of its head – it solves this by swinging its head form side - to - side as it swims , so it has a clear view all around itself , including above and below its wide set eyes allow the shark to see 360 degrees , which enables it to hunt prey such as squid that are able to propel themselves swiftly in any direction			1
while the shark has a large blind spot in the centre of its field of vision - in front of its head – it solves this by swinging its head form side - to - side as it swims , so it has a clear view all around its body , including above and below			1
another shiny helmet lets wearers try the backward / forward vision of the chameleon , using metal ' spouts ' coming up from the top of the helmet , with mirrors inside			2
chameleons arguably have the most distinctive eyes among reptiles , with a scaly cone - shaped lid and small round opening in the middle for a pupil			0
one of the helmets enables people to see like a chameleon			0
it is the not the first headset to be developed that allows humans to experience the sensation of seeing in two separate directions at one , as seen in this video one shiny helmet lets wearers try the backward / forward vision of the chameleon ( left ) which can focus its eyes independently to look at two objects at the same time , while another helmet gives the the viewpoint of a horse ( right ) , which has a blind spot that humans may find frustrating the sleek aluminium helmets , which were hand crafted by master coachbuilder @entity199 , hide optics similar to those used in a periscope to ' bend ' light and give different effects , such as seeing behind and at an elevated level			1
here , the helmets are shown mid way through their production the lizard can rotate and focus its eyes independently to look at two objects at the same time – something that is difficult and disorientating for wearers of the helmet			0
this unusual ability gives the lizard a 360 - degree view around its body and when it sees prey , it is able to focus both eyes in the same direction to get a clear view and accurately gauge its depth before launching its sticky tongue to catch a fly , for example			0
a giraffe - inspired helmet gives wearers the feeling of being taller than they are , while another lets them explore the wide peripheral vision of a horse , including its challenging blind spot at the centre of its vision , as if their eyes are on the sides of their head			1
the position of the horse 's eyes affords the animal a wide , circular view of 350 - degrees so it can spot predators sneaking up behind it , but just 65 - degrees of their vision is binocular			1
because its binocular vision - seeing with both eyes - is directed down its nose , the horse has a blind spot in front of its forehead			1
but it has the largest eyes of all land mammals , so it can easily detect the tiniest of movements the artists have also designed two helmets inspired by mythology and literature , allowing people to see the world through the eyes of the @entity270 from @entity271 ( pictured ) and @entity272 the two helmets based on literature and mythology give people an imaginative experience of seeing in a bizarre way			2
a 16th century illustration of cyclops is pictures left , and an illustration of the @entity270 , right ‘ the @entity283 ( a sketch is pictured ) is so called because of the strange lingering effect of dominating visual information such as a smile or the eyes , ’ the artists explained the artists have also designed two helmets inspired by mythology and literature , allowing people to see the world through the eyes of the @entity270 from @entity271 and @entity294 and @entity272			1
‘ @entity295 is so called because of the strange lingering effect of dominating visual information such as a smile or the eyes , ’ the artists explained , while ‘ the @entity272 allows one large central eye to take in the world around while a second tiny hidden eye focuses on a close up task			0
’ ms clearly and mr @entity30 explained : ‘ wearing the helmets , the visitor becomes a hybrid creature himself , part human , part machine , part animal , but also : part work of art ; a work of art that challenges those who contemplate the helmet - from the inside or from the outside - to take a new perspective on the world			1

@entity29 artists clearly @entity30 came up with the *concept* for the helmets
they are crafted from aluminium with carefully positioned mirrors inside
different shapes enable people to experience the 360 ° vision of a shark , elevated view of a giraffe and a horse 's *curious* blind spot
art project is designed to explore ‘ the mysteries of visual perception '
the helmets are on show at the @entity38 in @entity39
