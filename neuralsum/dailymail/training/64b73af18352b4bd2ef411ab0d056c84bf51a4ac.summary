it is said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at their bookshelf and music collection			0
and now experts have found that certain songs can even affect how generous a person is likely to be			0
@entity11 scientists discovered that listening to a pleasing song makes individuals more generous , but they become less altruistic if they are played a tune they dislike			1
@entity11 scientists have found that listening to a pleasing song makes individuals more generous , but they become less altruistic if they are played a tune they dislike			1
this graph shows changes between the allocation of money before and after listening to pleasing music , disliked music and silence it has previously been proven that music has the ability to strongly affect a person ’s emotions and sometimes even control them , with recent studies showing that emotion evoked by listening to a song can affect activity in the limbic and paralimbic brain structures			1
researchers from the @entity37 , @entity11 , conducted an experiment to examine whether music has the power to promote altruistic behaviour			1
they asked 11 male and female students , with an average age of 21 years , to complete a questionnaire in which they described their musical tastes and emotional experiences through music			0
individuals then listened to ‘ chill inducing ’ music that they liked , as well as a track they said they disliked			2
both of these tracks were followed by silence , according to the study published in @entity55			0
the researchers concluded : ‘ preferred music promotes altruistic behaviour , whereas disliked music is associated with selfish behaviour '			1
so , listening to @entity60 ( pictured ) could make his fans more generous , but people who are n't fans may become more selfish they were given money and were asked to share it with people who were represented as stylised figures on a computer screen			2
this money was distributed before and after listening to the music , with both men and women doling out more money after listening to their favourite songs			0
both sexes were stingier with their donations after hearing music that they disliked , and silence had no effect at all on their generosity			2
consequently , the researchers concluded : ‘ preferred music promotes altruistic behaviour , whereas disliked music is associated with selfish behaviour , and what differentiates these behaviours is the emotional response dictated by the listener ’s musical preferences			1
the study also found that that on the whole , men were more generous than women , and whether the music had words or not did not make a difference to an individual ’s generosity			1

an image of @entity105 , whose music could either make people more or less generous , is pictured scientists at the @entity110 claimed last month that listening to hip hop can help suffering from depression			1
' there is often a message of hope in among the lyrics , describing the place where they want to be – the cars they want to own , the models they want to date , ' the researchers wrote			0
in an article in @entity123 , the team claims that lyrics which speak of overcoming hardships and struggles can offer refuge			0
researchers recommend the message by @entity130 ( pictured ) & the @entity131 , released in 1982 , which includes the lyrics : ' i ca n't take the smell , ca n't take the noise got no money to move out , i guess i got no choice ' to help beat depression ' much of hip - hop comes from areas of great socioeconomic deprivation , so it 's inevitable that its lyrics will reflect the issues faced by people brought up in these areas , including poverty , marginalisation , crime and drugs , ' said dr @entity152 , of the @entity110			2
' in fact , we can see in the lyrics many of the key risk factors for mental illness , from which it can be difficult to escape			0
' hip - hop artists use their skills and talents not only to describe the world they see , but also as a means of breaking free			0
' we believe that hip - hop , with its rich , visual narrative style , can be used to make therapies that are more effective for specific populations and can help patients with depression to create more positive images of themselves , their situations and their future			0

researchers from the @entity37 in @entity11 , discovered that music has the power to promote altruistic behaviour
favourite tracks make people more generous while silence has no effect
while tracks that they disliked *reduced* how altruistic they were likely to be
altruism based on music is *dependent* on people 's personal preferences
whether a song has words did not make a difference in the experiment
