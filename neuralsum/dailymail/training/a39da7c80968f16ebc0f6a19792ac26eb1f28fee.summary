from the dingy donut shops of @entity1 to the cloistered police watering holes in @entity4 , a number of black @entity7 officers say they have experienced the same racial profiling that cost @entity9 his life			1
@entity9 , a 43 - year - old black man suspected of illegally peddling loose cigarettes , died in july after a white officer put him in a chokehold			1
his death , and that of an unarmed black teenager in @entity17 , @entity18 , has sparked a slew of nationwide protests against police tactics			1
on saturday , those tensions escalated after a black gunman , who wrote of avenging the black deaths on social media , shot dead two @entity27 policemen			0
retired detective @entity28 , a 30 - year veteran of the @entity7 , says he fell victim to racial profiling when he was off duty and insists : ' if i was white , it would n't have happened ' the protests and the ambush of the uniformed officers pose a major challenge for @entity27 mayor @entity38			1
the mayor must try to ease damaged relations with a police force that feels he has n't fully supported them , while at the same time bridging a chasm with communities who say the police unfairly target them			0
what 's emerging now is that , within the thin blue line of the @entity7 , there is another divide â€” between black and white officers			1
@entity52 interviewed 25 @entity54 officers on the @entity7 , 15 of whom are retired and 10 of whom are still serving			0
all but one said that , when off duty and out of uniform , they had been victims of racial profiling , which refers to using race or ethnicity as grounds for suspecting someone of having committed a crime			1
the officers said this included being pulled over for no reason , having their heads slammed against their cars , getting guns brandished in their faces , being thrown into prison vans and experiencing stop and frisks while shopping			1
the majority of the officers said they had been pulled over multiple times while driving			2
five had had guns pulled on them			2
@entity82 , who retired two years ago as a sergeant in the @entity84 in the @entity85 , said he once got stopped while taking a jog through @entity4 's upmarket @entity87			0
' i had my @entity89 on me so it did n't escalate , ' said @entity82 , who has sued the department alleging he was racially harassed on the job			0
' but what 's suspicious about a jogger ? in jogging clothes ? ' the @entity7 and the @entity95 , the police officers ' union , declined requests for comment			1
however , defenders of the @entity7 credit its policing methods with transforming @entity27 from the former murder capital of the world into the safest big city in the @entity104			0
the badge and identification card of retired @entity7 detective @entity28 , who is one of dozens of black cops in @entity27 who say they are also victims of racial profiling ' it makes good headlines to say this is occurring , but i do n't think you can validate it until you look into the circumstances they were stopped in , ' said @entity119 , the former chief of the @entity120 , who is @entity54			1
' now if you want to get into the essence of why certain groups are stopped more than others , then you only need to go to the crime reports and see which ethnic groups are listed more as suspects			0
that 's the crime data the officers are living with			2
' @entity129 made up 73 percent of the shooting perpetrators in @entity27 in 2011 and were 23 percent of the population			0
some black @entity7 cops say the death of @entity9 ( pictured ) could have been avoided and add : ' that could have been any one of us ' a number of academics believe those statistics are potentially skewed because police over-focus on black communities , while ignoring crime in other areas			1
they also note that being stopped as a suspect does not automatically equate to criminality			0
nearly 90 percent of blacks stopped by the @entity7 , for example , are found not to be engaged in any crime			0
the black officers interviewed said they had been racially profiled by white officers exclusively , and about one third said they made some form of complaint to a supervisor			1
all but one said their supervisors either dismissed the complaints or retaliated against them by denying them overtime , choice assignments , or promotions			0
the remaining officers who made no complaints said they refrained from doing so either because they feared retribution or because they saw racial profiling as part of the system			1
in declining to comment to @entity52 , the @entity7 did not respond to a specific request for data showing the racial breakdown of officers who made complaints and how such cases were handled			2
@entity171 officers were not the only ones accused of wrongdoing			0
civilian complaints against police officers are in direct proportion to their demographic makeup on the force , according to the @entity7 's @entity179			1
indeed , some of the officers @entity52 interviewed acknowledged that they themselves had been defendants in lawsuits , with allegations ranging from making a false arrest to use of excessive force			0
such claims against police are not uncommon in @entity27 , say veterans			0
still , social psychologists from @entity192 and @entity193 universities and @entity194 have conducted research - including the 2004 study ' seeing @entity54 : @entity197 ' - showing there is an implicit racial bias in the @entity54 psyche that correlates black maleness with crime			2
@entity194 professor @entity203 cited a 2010 @entity206 @entity205 report on police - on - police shootings - the first such inquiry of its kind - that found that in the previous 15 years , officers of color had suffered the highest fatalities in encounters with police officers who mistook them for criminals			1
there 's evidence that aggressive policing in the @entity7 is intensifying , according to data from the @entity221			0
@entity28 , a former @entity7 detective , is suing the city over an altercation with police that he says ended in his head being smashed against the hood of his car police misconduct claims - including lawsuits against police for using the kind of excessive force that killed @entity9 - have risen 214 percent since 2000 , while the amount the city paid out has risen 75 percent in the same period , to $ 64.4 million in fiscal year 2012 , the last year for which data is available			2
people who have taken part in the marches against @entity9 's death - and that of @entity17 teenager @entity239 - say they are protesting against the indignity of being stopped by police for little or no reason as much as for the deaths themselves			1
' there 's no real outlet to report the abuse , ' said @entity248 president @entity247 , a former @entity7 captain who said he was stigmatized and retaliated against throughout his 22 - year career for speaking out against racial profiling and police brutality			1
officers make complaints to the @entity7 's investigative arm , the @entity255 , only to later have their identities leaked , said @entity247			2
one of the better - known cases of alleged racial profiling of a black policeman concerns @entity28 , a decorated detective who retired this year after 30 years of service , including in @entity27 's elite @entity261			1
shortly before 1 a.m. one night in august 2012 , @entity28 was leaving a birthday party at a trendy @entity27 nightclub			0
wearing flashy jewelry , green sweatpants and a white t - shirt , @entity28 walked toward his brand - new white @entity267 when two white police officers approached him			1
what happened next is in dispute , but an altercation ensued , culminating in @entity28 getting his head smashed against the hood of his car and then spun to the ground and put in handcuffs			0
' if i was white , it would n't have happened , ' said @entity28 , who has filed a lawsuit against the city over the incident			0
the @entity282 said it could not comment on pending litigation			0
at an ale house in @entity287 , @entity4 last week , a group of black police officers from across the city gathered for the beer and chicken wing special			1
they discussed how the officers involved in the @entity9 incident could have tried harder to talk down an upset @entity9 , or sprayed mace in his face , or forced him to the ground without using a chokehold			2
they all agreed his death was avoidable			2
said one officer from the @entity300 in @entity301 , ' that could have been any one of us			0

many black officers say that , when off duty and out of uniform , they have been victims of racial profiling
officers say this includes being pulled over for no reason , having their heads slammed against cars and having guns brandished in their faces
others say they have been thrown into prison vans and experiencing stop and frisks while shopping
a group of police officers says @entity9 's death was avoidable and adds : ' that could have been any one of us '
