a businessman who was wrongly issued with a £ 15,000 phone bill by @entity2 only managed to get it cancelled by staging a three - hour sit - in at the firm 's headquarters			1
@entity7 was sent the enormous invoice after the mobile phone company put him on a new tariff , but after eight hours on the phone he was unable to get them to admit their mistake			1
eventually , he was forced to go and camp outside the multinational firm 's headquarters - and they were so desperate to make him go away that they caved in and cancelled the bill			1
victory : @entity7 managed to get a £ 15,000 phone bill cancelled by protesting at @entity2 's head office mr @entity7 , 52 , who runs a clothing business in @entity25 , @entity26 , said that his troubles started when he was put on a new package and told his bill would be recalculated			1
@entity2 then sent him a series of inflated bills adding up to £ 14,949.41 - without explaining why he suddenly had to pay more			2
' i have been a @entity2 customer for 21 years with no trouble , ' he said			2
' but in december they called me to say they had made a mistake and they would recalculate my bill			2
' but they never called me back and never let me know in writing what my new tariff was			2
all they want is for me to pay up but i 'm not going to because they have made a mistake , not me			0
' i have n't used any more text or data than i did before i went into the @entity48 store to get a new deal			0
i really do n't understand what has changed			0
' proactive : mr @entity7 had been unable to resolve the situation by phoning customer services he repeatedly tried to phone the company to discuss the error , but was unable to rectify the situation			1
' i must have spent eight hours on the phone to them being transferred to @entity60 , then @entity61 , then onto @entity62 and back to @entity63 , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' on one occasion i waited 27 minutes to speak with someone who told me they would call me back but they never did			0
that 's just basic disregard for their customers			2
' the businessman finally decided to take drastic action , and yesterday he drove two hours from his home to the firm 's head office in @entity77 , @entity78			1
staff there initially said it would take three days to resolve the problem - but when mr @entity7 refused to leave the premises , they dealt with his issue immediately			1
hq : @entity2 's global headquarters are situated in @entity77 , @entity78 , two hours from mr @entity7 's home he said : ' all seven car parks were full so i parked at the very front of the building , ignoring protestations from the security guys , and marched into reception			1
' i was directed to the retail shop in the foyer - the shop staff were apparently highly trained in " problem resolution "			0
' the techie guy i spoke to made calls to various teams and one hour later appeared to tell me it would be sorted on friday			0
' i said this was unacceptable and i feared they were just giving me the run - around like they 've been doing for the past four months			0
' i thought nothing would be resolved by friday so i told him i would wait there until then			0
he told me i could not do that so i sat firmly on a chair and told him to call security			0
' he disappeared to the office and one hour later the headquarters store assistant manager appeared and told me that the whole bill would be cleared immediately			2
' about 15 minutes later i was on my way with a letter confirming that my overcharge had been cleared and a copy of my correct contract			0
' they have apologised and have launched an investigation , but they could have done a lot of damage to other people and businesses			0
' a @entity2 spokesman said that an ' internal communication error ' was to blame for mr @entity7 's enormous bill , and confirmed it has now been wiped clean .			1
