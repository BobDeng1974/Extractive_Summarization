by @entity0 the optimum amount is 3 - 4mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight one hour prior to exercise many of us rely on our morning cup of coffee to help us feel more alert , but new research says it can actually help us perform better in the gym , too			1
the caffeine in coffee makes exercise feel easier , improves attention and reduces symptoms of fatigue - and a cup at the right time can help us to exercise harder and for longer			1
studies show the optimum amount is 3 - 4mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight one hour prior to exercise			1
an average mug of instant coffee contains approximately 100mg of caffeine			1
so for someone who weighs 61kg who wants to consume 3.5mgs of caffeine , that would equal 213.5mgs - or just over two average mugs			2
this amount of caffeine enables gym bunnies to perform for 30 per cent longer , while improving alertness and the ability to sustain motor skills and helping persistence , vigour and output levels according to a new report from the @entity43			1
studies have shown how caffeine improves endurance and performance in cycling high intensity running , repeated sprinting and sports such as football and rugby ; and some athletes have said they consume caffeine to enhance their endurance , alertness and motor skills			2
these benefits result from the actions of caffeine in the brain where it reduces the chemical messages that normally induce fatigue and stimulates energy production and fat oxidation			2
however nutrition experts warn of the associated dangers of continued reliance of caffeine for sports			1
' coffee is a proven performance enhancer and weightloss aid , but we do need to be careful ' ' the short term effects of caffeine on fatigue , endurance and performance are well established and for many drinking large volumes of coffee and caffeine energy drinks this is the norm , ' says dr @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 ( yorktest.com )			1
' however , there are many negative effects of caffeine including insomnia , anxiety , headaches , palpitations and high blood pressure that also come into play			1
' high caffeine consumption can also cause high levels of homocysteine in the blood , raised levels of which are associated with strokes , heart - attacks , dementia and infertility – it ’s important to not only think about the quick fix but the longer term on your health too			1
' independent personal trainer @entity110 from urbanenergiefitness.com has written at length about the pros and cons of drinking coffee for fitness on his website , highlighting many fo dr @entity84 's concerns			0
however he says it 's still worth drinking			0
' coffee is a proven ergogenic ( performance enhancer ) and weightloss aid , but we do need to be a little careful			0
one must exercise prudence when incorporating coffee into the diet			2
' too much caffeine causes stress on your adrenal system which can lead to poor sleep and increased cortisol levels ( stress ) - and ultimately weight gain			0
there are many negative effects of caffeine including insomnia , anxiety and headaches ' some people tolerate caffeine better than others , so that 's why everyone needs to be careful about how much they 're having			1
' the recommended daily dose for an average person is 400mg , which equates to around 4 cups of coffee each day ; obviously this is dependent on what coffee we 're drinking			0
if we keep within this bracket , we should not experience the associated negative side effects			0
' i would recommend drinking coffee for three particular purposes including pre-workout to maximize performance , in the morning to help you wake up , and for general weight loss			0
' around 70 million cups consumed every day in the @entity168 , and contrary to popular belief exercise lovers who drink it do not necessarily need to compensate by increasing their intake of water			0
recent research found any diuretic effect of caffeine in a normal cup of coffee is more than balanced by the amount of water in the drink - leading to hydration			2
recent research from @entity184 reveals that 51 per cent of us drink caffeinated drinks during the day , with 55 per cent drinking 3 or more cups of coffee per day			0
nutritionist @entity190 comments : ' caffeine is scientifically proven to help you when exercising , however it 's an unpredictable substance			0
when drinking coffee you ca n't be sure on the amount of caffeine you are ingesting			2
it 's important to stay hydrated with water as it improves performance and helps keep the body running at an optimum temperature			0
staying hydrated will also improve your concentration levels , allowing you to get more out of your workout			0
' the research from @entity184 also revealed that 62 per cent of us only drink water when we are really thirsty			0
' getting thirsty is actually one of the very last physical effects dehydration has on the body so the damage may have already begun , ' says @entity190			0
key insights on coffee and making exercise feel easier drink coffee one hour before morning or lunchtime exercise			1
if you want to exercise in the afternoon or evening , enjoy a coffee with your lunch to avoid the effect of the lunchtime dip for competitive sports , consuming coffee improves attention to detail , observance of your surroundings , and reduces symptoms of fatigue through caffeine 's effect on the central nervous system3 hydration is important for endurance exercise performance			1
coffee , when consumed in moderation ( four to five cups of coffee or 400mg of caffeine per day ) , provides similar hydrating qualities to water and does not cause dehydration @entity241 , exercise biochemistry professor at @entity242 , says : ' studies show that if you consume enough caffeine at the right time , it can enhance your physical performance			1
' new research shows black instant coffee consumed one hour prior to exercise can improve endurance performance in a similar way to pure caffeine ( of equivalent amounts ) , which suggests coffee may be a very effective way to consume caffeine before exercise			1
' ' studies have found caffeine consumption has a greater effect on physical performance in those who are recreationally active than in trained athletes , and can improve cycling , running , and high - intensity sports such as football and rugby over a 80 - 90 minute period			2
' for pregnant women the @entity271 recommends consuming no more than 200mg of caffeine per day from all sources .			0
