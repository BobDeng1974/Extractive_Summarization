call for vigilance : @entity2 's assistant commissioner , @entity1 has warned that @entity4 @entity3 are guilty of ' complacency and passivity ' over the threat from home - grown jihadists @entity3 communities in @entity4 are guilty of ‘ complacency and passivity ’ over the threat from home - grown jihadists , the @entity4 ’s top counter-terrorism officer warned last night			1
the @entity2 ’s assistant commissioner , @entity1 , said there were many cases where ‘ warning signs ’ about extremists were not brought to the attention of authorities			1
she also indicated some @entity3 were too accepting of radical views , saying it was the police ’s ‘ greatest challenge ’ to make them ‘ wholly hostile to violent extremism ’			1
her comments came as the government was confronted with a damning assessment by a former head of the military of @entity4 ’s capacity to confront terrorism			2
lord @entity32 of @entity33 , chief of the defence staff until last year , said the military was ‘ not good enough ’ to deal with the global threat from jihadis			1
the crossbench peer , formerly general sir @entity32 , called for a rise in defence spending and warned that without it , the effectiveness of the @entity42 would inevitably deteriorate further			1
he told the @entity44 that militant jihadism was the biggest threat to the ‘ free world today ’ , adding : ‘ are our @entity42 in a fit state to play their role in dealing with these and other risks to our way of life ? … the answer must be that it ’s not good enough but it ’s some consolation that it ’s better than any other allied nation except the @entity56			2
’ another senior police officer backed miss @entity1 ’s remarks			2
sir @entity59 , the chief constable of @entity60 , said a lot of extremists were radicalised ‘ in their own community ’			2
he said propaganda videos of @entity66 made the conflict look like a ‘ boy scout camp ’ when the reality was ‘ very brutal , very callous ’			0
‘ we must n’t over-emphasise the power of the internet , ’ he said			0
‘ we know that a lot of people have been radicalised in their own community by people who themselves have given this very perverted message			0
’ he added that police needed the ‘ whole of the community to counter this narrative ’			2
' brutal ' : sir @entity59 , the chief constable of @entity60 said propaganda videos of @entity66 made the conflict look like a ' boy scout camp ' when the reality was ' very brutal , very callous ' the government ’s former counter-terror adviser @entity84 called for ministers to bring back powers used to control terror suspects , which were watered down after pressure from @entity91			0
he said it was impossible for police and security services to follow jihadis returning to @entity4 from @entity66 or @entity96 and said ministers were wrong to ‘ abandon ’ control orders which had protected the public			0
miss @entity1 , who leaves her role tomorrow , made her comments in an address to the @entity104 think - tank			0
she said there is less ‘ alertness ’ among @entity4 muslims about extremism compared with those in other countries			0
but she said violent images from @entity66 and @entity96 were forcing them to confront the problem			0
police were using the conflicts to try to convince families and friends to turn in loved ones if they suspect them of extremist activities damning : lord @entity32 of @entity33 , chief of the defence staff until last year , said the military was ' not good enough ' to deal with the global threat from jihadis she said : ‘ in the @entity4 we want to depend more on families , schools , friends , health professionals , employers , observing changes in behaviour and having the confidence to come forward			1
we do have frequent examples of this , but also many examples of warning signs being missed , ignored or not being brought to the attention of the authorities			1
’ miss @entity1 added : ‘ in the @entity4 , it will be communities that defeat terrorism and it remains our greatest challenge to support the development of communities that are wholly hostile to violent extremism and to identify , support and protect those who are vulnerable to radicalisation			1
’ but she said that communities also need to ‘ stand up to them and reject them ’ , adding : ‘ the daily awful news stories underline the scale of the challenge and are , i believe , reducing complacency and passivity			0
