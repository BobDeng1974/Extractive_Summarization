by @entity0 a shocking photograph of a sick and distressed coyote cramped into a tiny cage has again placed @entity4 's troubled @entity6 reality show firmly under the spotlight			1
according to the whistleblower who took the depressing picture , the coyote had been captured and held for three days beforehand for use in a scripted scene in which the show 's star , @entity14 , lures and traps a wild coyote lurking in a barn			1
even more damning for @entity4 , the person who provided the photograph alleges that when the time came to film the scene , the coyote was too sick , so the show runners paid $ 500 to have another one transported from @entity24 to @entity25 - which is illegal			1
caged : this is the coyote that was allegedly held while sick for @entity4 's @entity6 show for use in filming in may 2013 it is then alleged , that even with the replacement coyote on set , the producers still brought the sick one on location for the may 10 , 2013 filming , ' just in case something happens '			1
the scripted segment was aired in the episode lured into @entity40 in july 2013 and was filmed on may 10 , 2013 in @entity41 , @entity25 , three days after the photograph of the caged coyote was taken in @entity42 @entity25			2
according to an investigation by @entity44 , @entity45 - the production company commissioned by @entity4 to make @entity6 - obtained the first coyote through the @entity48 ( @entity49 )			1
@entity44 ' investigation also alleges that even though the sick coyote was captured by a licensed wildlife control operator - the show broke @entity25 regulations that forbid keeping captive wildlife for more than 48 hours			1
more - so , the investigation also got hold of government documents that show state wildlife regulators had been warning @entity60 about violations and animal welfare issues since march 2012			2
according to the allegations of the man who provided the photograph , a @entity49 official captured the coyote at the request of the show and ' was transported for hours in cramped conditions '			2
reality show : the show follows the exploits of @entity25 woodsman @entity74 , nicknamed ' the @entity60 ' as he traps nuisance animals across the @entity76 however , it is not known if the coyote was kept inside the cage it was pictured in for three whole days , but regardless , as the may 10 shoot approached the coyote was sick and had begun to limp			1
the fact it was brought to the filming location along with its replacement left the source who provided the photograph to @entity44 , ' sickened '			0
another person who witnessed the coyote said that it ' was just sitting there , so they had to get another coyote fairly quickly			0
' @entity95 documents obtained from @entity45 reveal that the second coyote was obtained from @entity97 , a farm in @entity24 that breeds exotic animals			1
its owner , @entity99 made the news in 2011 when one of his own kangaroos attacked and injured him			0
the new coyote was fetched by staffers from @entity45 on may 9 for $ 500 and brought to @entity25			1
this is against @entity25 law and while the state can exempt zoos or researchers to do this , it is uncommon			0
friends : @entity114 is aided in the show by his friend @entity116 - but it has come under fire in the last year for allegations of animal cruelty during filming @entity120 , an official with the @entity121 told @entity44 the main concern is rabies			2
according to @entity25 officials there are no recorded exemptions dated on may 9 or 10 for the transportation of a coyote into @entity25			0
so far representatives from @entity4 and @entity45 have refused to comment on the matter			0
however , @entity45 ’s vice president @entity131 denied the practice of snaring animals deliberately for the reality show and insisted that the ' coyote in question was determined to be sick by the licensed officers on location , and the determination was made not to film with it because production policy is not to film with sick or injured animals			1
' on the day in question you bring up , a licensed @entity49 officer arrived to a location with a coyote he had caught after receiving a nuisance call , and when he brought it to us , the licensed @entity49 officers on set moved it from the smaller cage it was caught in to an appropriately sized cage			0
' in its tagline , @entity6 is supposed to give nusiance wildlife ' a second lease on life			0
' during previous allegations that the show is too scripted , @entity45 has said that ' @entity49 officers are compensated for bringing animals to production that they have captured in the regular course of their work			1
' commissioned : @entity4 have said ' the notion that there is a culture of ' neglect ' at the only network that is devoted to celebrating and protecting animals is absurd ' animal rights groups , already sickened by prior allegations of abuse by the show have called for the show to be axed			1
' it appears that numerous @entity25 animal - protection laws were violated in the way that this ailing coyote was handled , and @entity184 is filing a complaint with the @entity121 , ' said @entity184 ( @entity184 ) , @entity186 , @entity187			2
' @entity184 will also file a complaint with the @entity189 regarding numerous apparent violations of the federal @entity191 in the production of this episode of ‘ @entity6 ’ and numerous others			0
' earlier this year , @entity44 allaged that the production team associated with @entity6 mistreated animals and ' found " evidence of a culture that tolerated legally and ethically dubious activities			1
' the allegations included a zebra being sedated and animals being trapped beforehand only to be caught again as part of a script			0
legal warnings for @entity6 : in august 2013 , @entity206 sent @entity74 a warning letter that some of his actions on the show were a violation of his @entity213 permit @entity4 released a statement to @entity216 's @entity215 , saying in part : ' the life and welfare of all animals is of paramount importance to @entity4			1
it is core to our ethos that every animal 's life has value ... the notion that there is a culture of ' neglect ' at the only network that is devoted to celebrating and protecting animals is absurd			0
' claims in the ' @entity44 ' article were brought to the production company 's attention nearly nine months ago			2
where appropriate , @entity45 promptly instituted changes to further ensure the welfare of animals while filming the series			0
@entity131 , senior vice president of @entity45 , said " the idea that there is a culture of neglect or abuse on the show is completely false ... everyone on the show from staff to talent love animals			2
' ' the idea that animals are killed or drugged on ' @entity6 ' is false , ' he said			0
the @entity76 @entity258 , which enforces the @entity259 , told @entity216 in january it is ' fact - finding ' but has not launched an investigation .			0

photograph shows ' sick and *unresponsive* ' coyote captured for use in @entity6 on set in @entity25 in may 2013
picture was taken by *member* of the production team concerned for the animals welfare
@entity273 was allegedly held for three days - the legal limit for trapped animals in @entity25 is 48 hours
the animal was so sick that a replacement was brought in from @entity24 for $ 500 from an exotic animal breeder
this *contravenes* *inter-state* laws *designed* to stop the *spread* of rabies
this is the latest *revelation* to hit the troubled show after allegations of animal abuse earlier in the year
@entity4 and production company @entity45 have called allegations of mistreatment ' absurd '
