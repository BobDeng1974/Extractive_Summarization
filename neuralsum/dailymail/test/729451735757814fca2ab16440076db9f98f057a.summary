@entity0 is developing a fondness for @entity2			1
two goals for @entity4 against @entity5 were followed by two goals in the @entity8 semi-final against @entity9			1
it is a stage that suits him and @entity12 will expect even more when they return for the @entity8 final next month			1
‘ let us hope he keeps that up and scores twice in the final , ’ said @entity13			2
‘ we are happy for him			2
he is a key player for us , in a good moment			0
’ @entity0 celebrates as his goals take @entity12 into the 2015 @entity22 the @entity23 forward wheels away after opening the scoring in the 2 - 1 defeat of @entity9 on saturday @entity0 slides to his knees as he keeps his impressive scoring record at @entity2 going after an explosive start to his first season in @entity5 , including a burst of 14 goals in 18 games , @entity0 has emerged from a more subdued mid-season with three strikes in his last three matches			1
the extra-time winner on saturday , however , owed almost everything to a dreadful goalkeeping error by @entity40			2
@entity0 is shortlisted for the @entity41 with @entity43 ’s @entity42 the hot favourite , but it may be the most impressive debut campaign from an overseas signing since @entity48			1
like @entity48 , who arrived at @entity43 in 1996 - 97 , @entity0 can end his first season with an @entity8 win and @entity51 will stress the marginal gains if @entity12 can claim second in the @entity53 for the first time in a decade			1
the @entity4 international struck his second goal to save @entity12 in extra-time @entity12 team - mates congratulate @entity0 as they head into a second successive @entity22 @entity0 's second goal owed a lot to a mistake by @entity9 keeper @entity40 if so , the @entity62 signed for £ 32million from @entity63 last summer has been largely responsible			1
he has been fabulous to watch , loyal to the traditions of @entity51 ’s flamboyant attacking style with bottomless reserves of energy and a contagious desire			0
he has 22 goals and there are signs of a good chemistry developing with @entity74 since the @entity76 ’s return from injury in january			2
they combined for the first at @entity2			1
@entity51 has admitted for weeks that he would like to give @entity0 a breather but his influence has been so vital — and the race for @entity83 places so tight — that the manager has found it difficult			1
and @entity0 just keeps going			1
his season started with 45 minutes in the @entity87 , his @entity12 debut , on august 10 and will stretch through to the @entity89 in his home country			1
the 26 - year - old also scored a brace at @entity2 in @entity4 's 2 - 0 defeat of @entity5 in november 2013 @entity0 celebrates his second goal against @entity5 before his move to the @entity53 from @entity63 he has played eight internationals since the @entity97 , starting in seven , with six of them on the other side of the @entity100			1
‘ of course , we are all tired and so is he , ’ said @entity13			0
‘ he has the @entity89 , too , but he just wants to play all of the time			0
now , we have to rest and finish the season with the objectives we had at the start			2
’ sunday will be a test of @entity12 ’s progress			2
can they stall @entity43 ’s title charge ? has @entity51 made enough improvements to halt his terrible run of results against @entity113 teams ? ‘ we have to show we are now on a consistent level and it is a good opportunity to do that next sunday , ’ said @entity51			0
‘ let ’s finish this season well			2
we have six games , a big game next weekend and i believe we have the spirit , which is encouraged by the results			0
‘ we have learned from our hiccups			0
we have matured a little bit			0
when we had a difficult moment against @entity9 the team kept going			2
we do n’t feel sorry for ourselves			0
we just keep to our plan			0
’ per @entity127 was forced off with an ankle problem but most of @entity51 ’s injury worries are clearing			0
‘ the cup final is better than any doctor , ’ quipped the @entity12 boss			1
@entity51 's side host league leaders @entity43 at the @entity135 in their next match @entity137 ( centre ) was among the substitutes on saturday as he continues his recovery @entity12 defender per @entity127 was forced off the @entity2 pitch with an ankle injury @entity137 was back in the squad , an unused substitute at @entity2 after five months out , and @entity146 played for the first time since dislocating his shoulder in january			1
in contrast to @entity0 , it has been a miserable first season at @entity12 for @entity146 , with operations on an ankle and a shoulder each ruling him out for three months			1
but the @entity155 defender is back and his next task will be a duel with @entity42			0
‘ i am so happy , it is so important to be back on the pitch with the team , ’ said @entity146			0
‘ it was hard for me after the second surgery but i am strong in my head			0
i need to work hard			0
i am not 100 per cent but i need to be ready			0
