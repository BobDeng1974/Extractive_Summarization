@entity1 coach @entity0 has criticized the behavior of @entity4 striker @entity3 , saying he has a nasty habit of insulting referees in @entity7 or @entity8			1
@entity10 league leader @entity1 hosts second - place @entity4 on sunday , and the @entity10 champions will climb into first if they win			1
the well - traveled @entity3 , who has played in @entity13 , @entity14 , the @entity15 , and his native @entity16 , is returning to form after recovering from a nagging heel injury			2
@entity3 in action against @entity19 in the @entity20 on tuesday night @entity0 thinks referee @entity21 should brace himself for a difficult time dealing with the notoriously fiery @entity3 , who has won league titles with @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and two - time defending champion @entity4			1
' the person who is going to be most provoked is rather mr @entity21 , like all the referees in this league who get insulted by this person , ' @entity0 said on friday at a pre-match news conference			0
' apparently , the referees are not bilingual or trilingual , so they do n't understand			1
in a way , it 's better to speak @entity8 or @entity7 to insult referees			0
' the @entity4 striker stretches his leg as he tries to pull the ball out of the air the game could be a turning point in the season , and opposes @entity1 's tight unit of largely homegrown players with the expensive signings of a @entity4 side sometimes found wanting for team spirit			0
@entity0 has warned his players to keep their composure - and to stay respectful			0
' i do n't want ( our team ) to provoke , i do n't want us to insult the officials , ' he said			0
' i hope we remember not to fall for @entity3 's provocations			0
' @entity3 has suffered an injury hit season but is now getting back to his best @entity4 's confidence is high following six straight wins , while @entity1 has been dealt a double blow by the injury - enforced absences of 21 - goal league top - scorer @entity65 and key center half @entity66 both out injured			1
@entity65 wo n't be sidelined for long by a hamstring injury , but @entity66 is out for the rest of the season with a knee injury , meaning @entity1 have to try and contain @entity3 with a makeshift center - half pairing .			2

@entity4 take on @entity1 in a top of the table clash in @entity76 on sunday
the @entity10 champions can go top if they beat the league leaders
@entity1 coach @entity0 claims @entity3 insults referees in @entity7 and @entity14 so they ca n't understand him
