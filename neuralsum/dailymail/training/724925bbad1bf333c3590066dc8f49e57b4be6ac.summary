@entity2 , 59 , subjected the family next door to @entity13 news reports , documentaries and other music stations throughout the night			1
@entity16 and @entity17 and their two teenage children were forced to wear earplugs to try and get some sleep			1
but when they complained @entity2 began a ' sustained campaign of anti-social behaviour ' - including vandalism and spraying them with a garden hose			1
the situation got so bad the family were eventually forced to move out of their semi-detached home next door to the defendant in the @entity35 area of @entity36			2
@entity2 had already been given an asbo for his behaviour which he admitted breaching on four occasions between september and october 2011			1
he was handed a six month community order with six months supervision at @entity42			1
recorder @entity43 told him : ' there is no doubt you played music at times which were inappropriate and in a manner bound to cause disruption and upset			2
' an asbo is serious and you breached it which is obviously a serious matter			0
' the court was told @entity2 became increasingly aggressive towards the family and at one point threw a garden ornament through their car window			1
on another occasion @entity2 sat on the bonnet of mrs @entity17 's car and stopped her from exiting her driveway			1
@entity2 had already been sentenced to an interim @entity1 meaning he must not cause anyone , including the @entity65 , harassment , alarm or distress			2
but while the interim @entity1 was in place @entity2 breached it on four occasions by playing loud music in anti social hours			2
mr @entity73 continued : ' on september 14 the @entity65 were awoken by loud music at 5.15am			0
through experience they were able to ignore it and put earplugs in			0
' the same happened on september 16 and 17 when @entity73 and mrs @entity17 were again awoken by loud music coming from the defendant 's house			0
anti-social behaviour : @entity2 , 59 , who lives in the house on the left , played @entity4 so loud it kept his neighbours awake			1
they eventually moved out of their home ' it was not just continuously loud music - it was being turned on and off - which is particularly irritating			0
it was loud , intrusive and completely inappropriate			0
' on october 7 music was again heard and it was monitored by @entity93 equipment			0
it was not just music but radio played loud and knocking against the wall			0
' the court heard @entity2 had previous matters for anti-social behaviour including a caution for his behaviour towards the @entity65			2
@entity102 , defending , said his client had a delusional disorder			0
an appeal against the imposition of the asbo will be heard at a later date .			0
