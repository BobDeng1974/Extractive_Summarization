@entity0 is opening up about life in the public eye , being a new mother and whether or not she would like to see her own mother become president in a new interview			1
@entity7 , whose mother @entity8 is expected to formally announce her presidential campaign this sunday , said it is time the @entity11 had a female leader			1
' one of our core values in this country is that we are the land of equal opportunity , but when equal has n't yet included gender , there is a fundamental challenge there that , i believe , having our first woman president — whenever that is — will help resolve , ' said @entity7			1
yes , @entity47 is now a mom , wife , and advocate for women			2
being the daughter of two of the most influential people on the planet does n't seem to faze @entity47			0
she gave a candid interview to @entity32 this month about motherhood and talks of how her own mom should be the first female president of the @entity11			1
in between the interview she was able to take a few editorial shots in all black outfits			0
her cover look is a fitted black dress with cut out detail by @entity33			0
we love the fitted silhouette and cut - out that takes a basic lbd to new stylish heights			0
you can get @entity47 's dress now at @entity37 's for $ 1500			0
not all of our pockets are that deep for a black dress , but you are in luck			0
our team has picked our favorite lbd 's that will not break the bank , but have you smiling with style			0
@entity85 dress at @entity86 visit site do n't panic midi dress the fifth label at @entity90 visit site @entity92 & @entity93 at @entity94 visit site @entity96 at @entity97 visit site ' i now understand all of the enthusiastic , bombastically spectacular , wonderful things people say about their children , ' says @entity7 of her daughter ( above with her family shortly after the birth ) in the interview with @entity32 , @entity7 does not however say too much about her mother 's campaign plans , and focuses instead on the general lack of female representation in politics			1
' we 've made real progress on legal protections for women , but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace , ' she explains			2
' and if we look in the political sphere , it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of @entity127 is treated as a real success			1
since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality ? ' she then adds ; ' and so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president , absolutely it 's important , for , yes , symbolic reasons — symbols are important ; it is important who and what we choose to elevate , and to celebrate			1
' @entity7 , who looks almost unrecognizable in the accompanying fashion spread , also talks about life with daughter @entity143			1
@entity7 says that though the @entity11 is the ' land of equal opportunity , ' that is not true about gender , and a female president would change that @entity8 and @entity0 in a photo taken shortly after her birth in 1980 ' i now understand — this is something else that @entity154 and i talk about all the time — all of the enthusiastic , bombastically spectacular , wonderful things people say about their children , because we also feel and think all those things about @entity143 , ' said @entity7			1
and now , almost 25 years after she first hit the campaign trail as a child , @entity7 seems ready to do it all over again , as the 35 - year - old may once again return to the role of first daughter			2
@entity32 's editor - in - chief @entity168 is certainly excited about this prospect , describing @entity7 as ' innately regal ' in her editor 's letter			1
' she ’s a person of substance for sure , a young woman who , while measured in her manner , has a fierceness of conviction , and a calling to make the world a better place , ' says @entity168			0
@entity7 meanwhile is focused on seeing that first female president			2
' yes , we 've seen again and again , when women have been in positions of leadership , they have had different degrees of success versus their male counterparts , historically being able to build more consensus so that decisions have longer - term effects , whether in economic investments or in building social capital , ' says @entity7			2
' who sits around the table matters			0
and who sits at the head of the table matters , too			0
' as for her mom , her big announcement is expected to come on @entity202 , and from there she is off to @entity204 to get to work .			0
