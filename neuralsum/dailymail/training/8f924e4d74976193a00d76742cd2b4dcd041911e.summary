@entity0 is poised to overtake ailing rival @entity2 in car production as @entity0 motor manufacturing heads towards a new record high			1
strong and rising sales of @entity0 - built cars - both at home and abroad - mean @entity2 is set to slip from third place in the @entity14 production league - table - behind @entity12 and @entity13 - to be replaced by @entity0			1
figures to be released later this month are expected to show @entity0 car production nudging ahead of @entity2 with around 1.55million cars built in 2013			1
pushing ahead : figures to be released later this month are expected to show 1.55million cars were built in the @entity0 in 2013 this would be up from 1.47 million in 2012 and 1.35million in 2011			1
and it is predicted to hit a new record of nearly 2 million within three years			1
by contrast @entity2 ’s car production is expected to slip to around 1.54million cars for 2013 - down from 1.66million in 2012 and 1.88 million in 2011			1
@entity2 ’s ailing economy - exacerbated by problems with the @entity29 - and overcapacity under the current socialist government are cited as key reasons for its declining car sales			1
a spokesman for @entity0 ’s @entity34 ( @entity34 ) said : ‘ we ’re currently neck and neck with @entity2			1
‘ but @entity0 ’s car production is on an upward trend			1
@entity2 ’s is on a downward trend			0
we ’re about to cross			0
it could well be that the new figures will show that 2013 is the year in which we overtake them			0
’ @entity12 is on track for 5.45m cars in 2013 with @entity13 reaching 1.76m			0
but recent big investments by car - makers in @entity0 are aimed at boosting production even further , said the @entity34			1
so by 2017 @entity0 is expected to hit a new record production level exceeding the 1.92million cars built in 1972 during the highpoint of the @entity0 car industry - but also a period blighted by strikes , industrial unrest and union militancy			1
car production for the first 11 months of 2013 was up 4.5 per cent to 1.424million with the @entity34 predicting full year production is ‘ set to pass 1.million for the first time in six years			2
’ the news comes as latest figures released yesterday ( tuesday ) showed sales of cars in the @entity0 soared by nearly 11 per cent in 2013 to a six year high of more than 2.26milliion - and back to levels last seen before the economic melt - down			1
production : the motor industry and its suppliers already employs 750,00 people in the @entity0 the sales boom has been fuelled by rising confidence , cheap and flexible car finance deals , and windfall pay - outs by the banks to customers from the ‘ personal protection insurance ’ or ‘ ppi ’ miss - selling scandal			1
pay - outs of around £ 3,000 per customer equate roughly to the deposit needed on a car finance plan			0
the motor industry and its suppliers already employs 750,00 people in the @entity0			0
some 80 per cent of the cars built in the @entity0 are exported			1
of those exports , worth £ 30bn , half go to @entity14 and the other half to the rest of the world			0
exports of cars and engines make up 10 per cent of the value of total @entity0 exports			2
the car - building boom is being spearheaded by mainstream @entity0 - brands such as @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 , super-luxury car - makers like @entity100 and @entity101 , and the @entity0 factories of @entity104 giants such as @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			2
@entity101 , owned by @entity12 ’s giant @entity108 , is expanding to produce a new luxury 4x4 at its @entity111 factory			0
@entity105 is about to start full production of its new generation @entity116 model at its factory in @entity118 where it employs more than 6,100 building it and the note , juke and all - electric leaf models			0
in 2012 it recorded record production of 510,57 cars			1
from 2015 a new @entity127 model will be added following £ 250m investment creating 1,000 new jobs at the factory and with suppliers			0
@entity97 , owned by @entity12 ’s @entity132 , started production at its @entity135 plant of its latest generation model in november with the help of 1,000 new robots installed as part of a major £ 750million investment that helps preserve 5,500 jobs at the plant			0
leading the way : the car - buying boom is being spearheaded by companies such as @entity96 @entity100 , also owned by @entity132 , is enjoying record sales with its @entity147			0
@entity96 , owned by @entity149 ’s @entity148 , is now expanding globally after investing billions in @entity0 including £ 1.5billion in a new hi - tech aluminium facility in @entity151 creating 1,700 new jobs			2
because so many car - makers are foreign owned , executives refer now to ‘ the car industry in @entity0 ’ rather than ‘ the @entity0 car industry ’			2
but business leaders and ministers say their presence proves that the @entity0 is a good place to manufacture motor cars			2
new car sales in the @entity0 alone raced to a six - year high in 2013			1
a total of 2,264,737 new cars were registered in 2013 - a 10.8 % rise on the 2012 figure and the best annual total since the pre-recession year of 2007 , said the @entity34			1
