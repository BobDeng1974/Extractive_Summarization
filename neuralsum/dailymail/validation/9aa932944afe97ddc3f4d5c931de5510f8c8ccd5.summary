@entity0 will fail to qualify for the @entity1 due to a difficult season run in , claim @entity4 's pundits			1
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 were on @entity4 ahead of @entity9 's match with @entity10 and the trio all picked @entity12 as @entity14 champions with @entity9 , @entity15 and @entity16 completing their top four			1
however @entity19 's side , who visit @entity21 on sunday afternoon , have been on a respectable run of recent form whereas neighbours @entity9 have faltered in their past nine matches			1
@entity0 manager @entity19 takes training on friday ahead of facing @entity16 at @entity21 ‘ @entity12 i think will finish top			1
they ’ve strengthened their team better than anybody else and they ’ll prove they ’re the best , which they have been all season , ' said @entity5 at the @entity31			0
fellow pundit @entity7 insisted @entity9 's three wins in their past nine games was only a blip and they 'll finish at least second : ' i think it will be a monumental slip of concentration and huge slip up from @entity9 , but i ’m sure they ’ll be fine , ' @entity7 told @entity4			2
the @entity4 pundits on saturday all predicted that @entity0 will fall short in the race for the top four here is the current form table but the @entity4 pundits think @entity9 will still finish second this season however the @entity4 pundits all declared that @entity0 will miss out on @entity1 football again next season			1
@entity19 's side face @entity1 rivals @entity12 , @entity15 and @entity16 before the season concludes			1

before today ( saturday ) i would have said that they would finish fourth but looking through all the fixtures , i really think it favours @entity16 , ' added @entity5			2
' as much as it pains me to say , i think they ’re going to struggle to finish in the top four with those remaining fixtures			0
' the @entity16 players appear relaxed ahead of a crunch @entity1 @entity0 prevailed in the last fixture with @entity16 , winning 3 - 0 back in december at @entity61 @entity63 ' @entity16 side host @entity0 on sunday in what will surely be a pivotal clash in the race for the top four : ‘ i completely agree with @entity5			1

they ’re at home , they have the advantage , they have the form , ' said @entity7			0
