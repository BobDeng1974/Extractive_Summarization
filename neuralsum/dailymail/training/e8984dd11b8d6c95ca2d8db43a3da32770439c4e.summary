@entity1 's superhuman effort to make 16 saves in @entity5 's @entity4 game against @entity6 could have been helped by his tourette 's , experts have claimed			1
they say the condition , which @entity1 has , can give sufferers more cognitive self - control , not less			1
researchers believe this is a lifetime of trying to control tics and also leads to improved timings			1
named after @entity30 doctor , @entity23 , who first described the syndrome in the 19th century , it is characterised by involuntary noises and movements			1
tics are usually vocal ( grunting , coughing and shouting ) or physical , with typical movements including jerking the head or jumping up and down			2
most sufferers are first diagnosed during childhood and it is linked to adhd and obsessive compulsive @entity40 : @entity41 the @entity5 goalkeeper made 16 saves in this weeks heartbreaking knockout match against @entity6 , the most by any keeper in a @entity4 match in nearly half a century			1
after the game , @entity1 was hailed a national hero , sparking a flurry of internet memes and even a prank to change the @entity53 picture of the @entity5 secretary of defence to a shot of him diving to catch a ball			2
' i ’ve never counted how many tics i have in a game , ' he said in a 2013 interview with @entity62 when asked about the condition			2
he said his tics include blinking , clearing his throat , and muscle tensing			2
' it happens all the time , without any warning , and it increases the nearer an important game draws , ' when the ball is far away , he says he indulges his twitches			2
' i do n’t suppress it , ' he told the @entity75 publication			0
however , he said when an opposing player approaches , he calms down			0
' i have no idea how i do it			0
not even my doctors can explain it to me			0
' it ’s probably because at that moment my concentration on the game is stronger than the @entity84 ’s syndrome			0
' mr @entity85 : @entity1 has been lauded as a national hero after his performance in @entity88 on tuesday the @entity89 today pointed out that his tourettes may have helped , tweeting ' people with @entity23 's have more cognitive self - control , not less - more from @ @entity93 @ timhowardgk # @entity94 ' it pointed to a 2006 study in the @entity97			1
@entity98 and colleagues at the @entity100 asked nine young patients with @entity23 ’s and 19 controls to sometimes make fast eye movements towards an onscreen target , and sometimes to do the reverse – to make fast eye movements in the opposite direction to a target			0
a coloured border on the screen told them which rule to follow , and the rule changed every two trials			0
switching between the two commands takes mental effort , especially when the natural reflex to look at a suddenly appearing target must be inhibited			0
as expected , the participants were slower to respond whenever the rule changed , as they adjusted their mental ‘ set ’ to the new rule			0
glum : in the end @entity1 was unable to prevent the @entity5 losing 2 - 1 in extra-time at the last 16 stage in @entity125 however , to the researchers ' surprise , without sacrificing their accuracy the @entity84 ’s patients actually slowed down less than the healthy controls			1
the researchers said the patients ’ superior performance at the task “ may reflect a compensatory change in which the chronic suppression of tics results in a generalised suppression of reflexive behaviour in favour of increased cognitive control ” .			1
