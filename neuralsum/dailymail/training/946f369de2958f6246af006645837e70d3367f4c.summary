a small town in @entity1 was hit with a whopper of a storm wednesday morning that left four feet of hail in its wake			1
officials from the @entity7 in @entity8 said that the storm was so severe and the hail so unrelenting that a major highway in @entity12 was completely covered			1
but the photos of the one - off event are so unbelievable that an army of online sceptics have cast doubt on their authenticity , suggesting that instead they may simply show large rocks			1
one @entity41 , a large suv , got stuck in hail up to its hood , @entity45 , a spokeswoman for the weather service office in @entity8 , told @entity47			1
when the weather service posted a photograph to @entity34 of a firefighter next to the ice — which reached all the way up to his chest — commenters could n't believe their eyes			2
' that just does n't even look real ! @entity58 ! ' @entity57 said on the site			0
commenters turned their disbelief into hypotheses , offering alternative explanations to the unbelievable reality			2
' looks like a bunch of rocks / stones , ' suggested @entity68			1
another cynical poster wrote : ' it 's a lite dusting of hail on some damn rocks			1
' perfect storm : the snow stranded motorists in muddy , hail drifts and closed a highway for several hours ' i can assure you we do not have big rocks like that in @entity1 , ' @entity45 retorted to @entity47			1
' that was four feet of ice , ' she insisted , adding that the hail was compacted by rain and floodwater across a wide area			2
the storm which dumped several feet of hail on a @entity1 town was apparently a supercell , also known as a ' rotating thunderstorm '			1
while the hailstones produced by the storm were not extremely large , the slow - moving storm allowed the hail to accumulate in one place			1
meteorologist @entity98 wrote on his blog that the hail was the result of ' the slow storm motion and its relatively efficient precipitation production '			1
he continued : ' the storm motion was so slow because the low - level easterly upslope nearly opposed the midlevel westerly flow			2
' this unusual weather front creates a storm which moves particularly slowly , meaning that the area directly beneath it is heavily affected even if it is not otherwise particularly severe			2
of course , to create that much hail required a large amount of water in the atmosphere - and according to mr @entity98 , the air was indeed much more moist than would be expected for the season			2
she blamed the ice 's rock - like appearance on drought			0
' we 're very dusty around here , ' she said			0
' it was actually the rain / water that caused the drifts , ' @entity45 said			0
' anytime you have hail accumulate two to four feet high and get over three inches of rain , no matter how it occurs , it 's pretty incredible			2
' the @entity129 said that at the storm 's climax , there was zero visibility on the road			0
maintenance crews worked on thursday to clear roads after the storm , which left so much hail in its wake that workers had to use snow plows to clear the piles from the road			1
' it was crazy , ' @entity7 meteorologist @entity144 said about the freak event			0
as the hail started to melt , it created flash floods which swept through the area			0
' it looked like soap suds , ' said a local tv meteorologist			0
' the storm was moving really slow and a combination of the pea - sized hail and four to six inches of rain created those conditions			1
' the rural area where the storm struck was mainly ranch land , about 25 miles north of @entity8 and south of @entity163			1
@entity165 gushed across the parched land , washing dirt and then mud into the hail , pushing it all onto @entity170 287 , @entity12 sheriff @entity164 said			0
' there were just piles of hail , ' said @entity174 with the @entity8 / @entity12 / @entity175			1
' some of the cars were just buried in hail and people were trapped in their cars			0
' the southbound lane of the highway , which was shut down around 5pm on wednesday , finally reopened early on thursday morning ,			0
emergency crews also got several swift - water rescue calls as the road was flooded in low - lying areas , she said			0
rural fences and vehicles suffered hail damage but there were no reported injuries			0
@entity192 said work crews stayed in roadside ditches on thursday afternoon diligently trying to break up the ice jams and debris that had fused together and prevented drainage			0
' we 've got five , six - foot high icebergs along the roadway , ' @entity192 said			0
' if we get another rainstorm it will flood again			0
' not the first time : a storm this huge hit @entity1 in 1993 and left behind nearly six feet of hail but the @entity7 said it 's starting to clear up and should be a sunny weekend			1
' that 's a good thing since it will take a few days for that hail to melt , ' said @entity209 , an @entity7 meteorologist in @entity8			1
pea - sized hail , flash flooding and rain combined to form the perfect storm , but it did n't set any records			1
@entity45 says the weather service does n't keep records of quantities of hail			0
freak of nature : the massive drift of hail appeared brown as it was covered in dust from the prolonged drought recently experienced in the area ' this was just one of those weird storms , ' @entity12 sheriff @entity164 told @entity228			2
the region is n't unfamiliar with this kind of weather either			0
a similar storm hit @entity233 , @entity1 , in 1993 , according to @entity234 , the chief forecaster at @entity8 's weather service			1
he said that the five to six - foot deep hail took over a month to melt			2

huge storm hit @entity8 and covered up major highway with deep covering of hail
online commenters express scepticism and say amazing pictures only show ' a bunch of rocks '
