by @entity0 to his millions of followers , @entity1 presented a picture of a loyal man who had been forced into exile from the country he loves			2
twenty - four hours after being dismissed by @entity7 , @entity1 took to @entity8 to post a picture of him looking distraught after his final test innings in @entity11 as @entity7 crashed to a defeat that sealed their 5 - 0 @entity14 humiliation			1
‘ so sad that this will now be the last time i leave a field in an @entity7 shirt , ’ posted @entity1			1
‘ i love @entity7 and honestly hope they have every success in the future			0
@entity39 can reveal that as soon as @entity1 was away from the public eye in the @entity11 pavilion he whistled happily all the way into the @entity7 dressing room and continued as he sat down in his place alongside team - mates			1
@entity1 ’s apparent nonchalance over his dismissal , at the start of an embarrassing clatter of wickets that left @entity52 cricket as a complete laughing stock , shocked his team - mates and the @entity7 management			1
some senior @entity7 figures believe he departed the international scene with a whiff of hypocrisy			0
his actions were considered another example of the attitude and poor example that had completely exasperated senior figures and convinced them it was the end of the road for their gifted maverick			0
over and out : @entity7 have decided it is not worth keeping @entity1 in the side happier times : @entity1 is presented with a commemorative cap after playing in his 100th test ‘ it said everything about his apparent commitment to @entity7 , ’ one of the people in that dressing room told @entity39 on thursday , ‘ it confirmed we had lost our way , lost the team ethos that had taken us so far			1
’ in isolation it may not seem too serious but to a chastened @entity7 , who had welcomed @entity1 back after the @entity87 text-gate scandal , it was pretty much the final straw			1
@entity1 had started the ashes as an integrated part of the @entity7 group but as time went on old habits began to creep back , with his behaviour starting to deteriorate after the @entity95			2
@entity39 ’s information is that @entity1 was perceived to be undermining coach @entity97 , whom @entity1 tried to oust as batting coach when he led his failed coup against @entity100 in 2008 , and whose relationship never recovered from ‘ text-gate ’			1
out of place ? he was a character , but @entity104 - born @entity1 never belonged there was the pivotal team meeting after the @entity107 , revealed in these pages on thursday , where @entity1 misjudged the mood of other players and started trying to garner support for his anti-flower stance			2
@entity1 ’s decision to whistle a happy tune after his demise in the final test was not the only time he clashed with his team - mates in @entity11			1
reports that he squared up to captain @entity121 are wide of the mark but the pair , @entity39 understands , did disagree over the best preparation for the final test			1
@entity121 wanted to concentrate on fitness , where @entity7 had been found wanting , whereas @entity1 thought they should be working on skills			1
it was then that @entity97 confronted @entity1 over what he saw as attempts to turn younger players against him after the @entity132 meeting and decided in his mind that @entity7 ’s record runscorer had to go if they were going to emerge from the ashes of their worst ever tour with their team principles reinstated			1
critic : @entity1 told @entity97 the issues that the @entity7 players had with his management at that stage it looked sure that @entity97 was going to stay to oversee that rebuilding process but even after he resigned last friday @entity1 had fallen out with far too many important figures for any sort of reprieve to be granted			1
he was told his fate on monday night , ahead of a final meeting between @entity121 , managing director @entity147 and one - day coach @entity148 , and knew that his @entity7 career was over when he conducted a coaching session at @entity153 on tuesday			1
it was confirmed by the @entity155 on wednesday			0
it is important these details emerge because the @entity155 remain adamant that they can not publicly say what @entity1 has done wrong for legal reasons , with the last details of @entity1 ’s contract settlement still being finalised			0
that decision is leaving them open to ridicule from @entity7 fans , who expect a proper explanation			0
there was even support for @entity1 on thursday , from prime minister @entity168 as only a one - sided version of events has so far emerged			0
re-integrated : team - mate @entity171 posted this picture of @entity1 on @entity25 in late 2012 with the caption : ' " re-integration complete			2
' @entity175 , the new national selector , became the first man involved in the seismic decision to speak publicly about the sacking on thursday , but his appearance on @entity180 was little more than an embarrassing shambles			0
no newspapers were allowed at the announcement of @entity7 ’s squad for their tours of @entity186 and @entity187 and @entity175 ’s answers to @entity180 ’s @entity189 , who was admirable in the circumstances , seemed strictly controlled			0
however , the usually personable @entity175 did allow himself to say of @entity1 ’s sacking : ‘ in a way it was a tricky decision but in another way it gives other players an opportunity to excel in that environment			0
there is a legal position and i ’m not at liberty to say anything else			0
@entity7 exit : @entity1 peers out of his car after discovering his international career is over ‘ any team has certain values that good teams adhere to and carry with them			1
@entity7 over the past four or five years have shown these good values			0
over time they can ( slip ) a bit but now is the time to rewrite those			0
we want to win back the positive perception of what the @entity7 team are all about			0
’ it has been a miserable week for that objective and @entity7 clearly remain paranoid about any confidentiality clause in their agreement with @entity1			2
but if one exists , is n’t @entity1 breaking it by leaking details of the @entity132 team meeting to his mouthpiece @entity225 ? @entity1 ’s attack on @entity171 , the most selfless of @entity7 players , via @entity225 on @entity25 on wednesday was a spectacular own goal for his status as a martyr and perhaps revealing of the real reasons behind his departure			2
and surely it frees up senior @entity7 figures to say far more than @entity175 managed on thursday			0
freelance : @entity1 can chase the money in @entity238 competitions after his @entity7 sacking			2

@entity39 can reveal @entity1 whistled happily after his final dismissal
comes after @entity1 's @entity8 post *insisting* he was ' so sad ' that his @entity7 career had ended , accompanied by the picture his last dismissal
' it said everything about his apparent commitment ' said one person in the dressing room at the final test in @entity11
he was also perceived to be undermining coach @entity97
@entity1 and @entity121 disagreed over the best preparation for the final @entity257 , which ended in defeat and confirmation of a 5 - 0 *whitewash*
