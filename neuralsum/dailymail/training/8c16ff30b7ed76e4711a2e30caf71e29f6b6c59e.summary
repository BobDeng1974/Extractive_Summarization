' over the course of the day the deceased and his work colleagues purchased a bottle of vodka each from a local store and shared the contents amongst themselves			2
' this is believed to have resulted in high levels of intoxication			0
' as the men prepared to finish work for the evening mr @entity20 came down the ladder , because the stairs had not yet been built , but fell and sustained fatal injuries to his chest			1
he broke a number of ribs , which punctured his lungs leading to a very sudden death			2
his colleagues could find no pulse and concluded that he had died - although they did not call the emergency services			0
' they decided to place mr @entity20 in a van and drive him away from the site , ' said @entity81			2
' it would appear that while driving down a single track road , @entity86 , @entity34 , the person driving the van tried to turn around			0
' this resulted in the @entity90 - type van being stuck between the raised banks on either side of the road , it was wedged firmly bank - to - bank			0

' ms @entity128 said that mr @entity20 , of @entity142 , @entity143 , had fallen around two metres			2
she said that supervisor @entity144 had been away from the site , and had not known that his workers had been drinking - or what had happened to mr @entity20			1
' he is very shocked by this , i have no reason to believe mr @entity144 knew there was drinking on his site , i do n't think it was a regular occurrence and there is no suggestion he was condoning this behaviour , " she said			0
