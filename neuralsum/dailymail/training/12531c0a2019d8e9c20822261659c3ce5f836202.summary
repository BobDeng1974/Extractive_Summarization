judging by @entity3 ’s dismal @entity2 performance in recent years , we ’ve been holding out for a hero			0
but fans hope all that could be about to change – after it was announced that @entity8 will be representing the @entity3 in the song contest in may			0
@entity11 , who is best known for 1980s hits such as @entity12 , it ’s a heartache and @entity13 , has described being chosen to perform for the country as ‘ an honour ’			2
hope : @entity17 - born singer @entity8 , pictured ( left ) this year and ( right ) in her 80s heyday , has been chosen to represent the @entity3 at this year 's @entity2 however , the 61 - year - old will be hoping to fare better than the last veteran singer who represented the @entity3			1
last year @entity21 was @entity3 ’s entrant into the contest , held in @entity24 , @entity25			1
despite being one of the better - known names to represent the country in recent years , the 76 - year - old finished in 25th place with only 12 points			1
whether or not @entity11 will achieve a better score in this year ’s contest , held in @entity34 , @entity35 , remains to be seen			2
it is widely believed that many countries vote for each other for ‘ political ’ reasons rather than for the quality of their songs			0
the @entity17 - born singer will be performing a track called @entity45 , written for her by @entity46			1
honoured : the 61 - year - old singer described being chosen as ' an honour ' he has previously penned hits for chart toppers including @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
@entity11 , whose husky voice has led to her being described as ‘ the female @entity56 ’ , said : ‘ it is an honour to represent my country and is also a wonderful way to ensure that my song @entity45 reaches the widest possible audience			1
‘ it is a very strong , catchy and melodic song that appeals to a wide range of people			0
@entity46 partially wrote this song at the dinner table at his house in @entity68 whilst we were all eating together			0
’ @entity11 , who was born @entity8 , credits her remarkably youthful looks to @entity72 injections , which she has had twice a year for 15 years			2
disappointing : @entity21 was @entity3 's entrant into the contest , held in @entity24 , @entity25 , but finished in 25th place with only 12 points last year she also showed off her slimmer figure after losing more than a stone and half in three months			1
and despite her last big hit in the @entity3 being almost 30 years ago , @entity11 has enjoyed continued success on the continent and hopes this will help her in the competition			0
she said : ‘ i do believe that @entity88 blessed me in life with a wonderful family , a successful career and a loving marriage , and remain thankful for that blessing			0
’ describing almost four decades of marriage to property developer @entity95 , she added : ‘ it ’s simple , we still love each other			0
