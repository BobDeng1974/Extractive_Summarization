@entity1 's dramatic bid to oust @entity3 chief executive @entity2 could thwart an initial £ 16million proposal being tabled by an alliance of potential investors including @entity7			1
a statement from former director @entity9 and shareholder @entity10 – two figureheads of the investment group – confirmed last night they have been in detailed discussions with the @entity16 board			0
@entity17 believes their proposal involves an up - front investment of around £ 16m – close to the current market value of the club - in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue			0
that would see them take control of the boardroom , with further investments then staggered to move closer to the £ 30m - plus @entity7 has previously stated it will take to restore @entity3			1
@entity1 is flexing his muscles with regards to @entity3 , and is putting investment in the club at risk ‘ we confirm that we are in discussions with the @entity38 regarding a proposal to provide the club with a funding package to be provided by like - minded individuals including @entity7 , ’ said a statement from @entity9 and @entity10			1
‘ the discussions should remain private and confidential and we will provide more details in due course			0
’ the potential success of those talks has , however , been thrown into serious doubt by @entity1 ’s bid to remove @entity2 and ally @entity49 as directors			1
both are perceived as being favourable towards the plan the @entity7 group are putting forward			2
@entity1 raised his stake at @entity16 to 8.9 per cent last week and is now seeking an extraordinary general meeting at which a resolution to axe @entity2 and financial expert @entity49 would be voted upon by shareholders			1
@entity3 were last night assessing whether the request from the @entity61 owner was ‘ properly constituted ’			2
should it be deemed valid and an egm ballot take place , the board have vowed to fight @entity1 ’s motion			2
@entity3 ceo @entity2 ( right ) has been targeted by controversial billionaire @entity1 the move has been described by one source close to @entity16 as a ‘ full - fronted attack ’ on the only two members of the board with previous experience of running football clubs – wallace through his time as chief financial officer at @entity77 and @entity49 via spells at @entity79 and @entity80			1
it also provides clear evidence that @entity1 will fight to have an influential say in the future of @entity3 as he seeks to protect his commercial interests			1
his sports direct firm already have retail contracts in place , while he also owns – but has yet to activate – naming rights for the stadium			0
@entity1 has amassed an estimated £ 4billion from his business interests and would seem to be confident of landing the backing of more than 50 per cent of shareholders for his proposed shake - up			2
@entity94 , chairman of the football board at @entity3 , has previously spoken of his support for @entity1 ’s greater involvement			1
he carries the voting rights for a 26.15 per cent chunk of @entity16 shares			0
a spokesman for @entity102 would only say that he was watching the latest development ‘ with interest ’ but the backing of his voting block would see @entity1 move within 15 per cent of his target			2
@entity1 currently owns 8.9 per cent of the @entity109 club , but is interested in increasing that stake hedge fund @entity111 are the largest single shareholder at @entity3 with a 16.3 per cent stake			1
non-executive director @entity114 is their representative and approved the @entity116 statement which said the board was ‘ united ’ in its support for @entity2 and @entity49			1
however , observers will recall @entity120 effectively switching sides during the boardroom battle that eventually ended in victory for the incumbents at the club ’s previous agm			0
this year ’s agm must take place before december 31 , but @entity1 ’s decision not to wait for that meeting could be viewed as a bid to cut off the @entity7 group at the pass			1
the @entity134 declined to invest in last month ’s stop - gap open offer that raised £ 3.13m			0
however , he then more than doubled his stake with an £ 850,000 purchase from fund managers @entity139 – a decision which kept his money away from a @entity3 board battling another imminent crisis			2
the @entity16 cash reserves are expected to run dry before the end of the year			0
@entity3 currently sit second in the @entity146 , six points behind @entity148 it ’s understood @entity1 held talks with the @entity3 board about providing a loan prior to the open offer			1
those discussions reportedly broke down over a demand to include trademark rights as a condition			0
closing off @entity7 could , though , leave finance from @entity1 as the clearest option left available to @entity3			1
in terms of purchasing shares , the tycoon is currently limited to a 10 per cent stake at @entity16 through an agreement struck with the @entity163 as part of their rules on dual ownership of clubs			0
there could be an application for the board of the governing body to consider raising that limit , provided it was backed by a detailed business case			0
responding to the @entity177 demand from @entity1 , the @entity3 board said yesterday : ‘ if valid , the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company ’s forthcoming annual general meeting , further details of which will be announced in due course			2
‘ the board is united in its support of the executive team			0
if the notice is valid and is not withdrawn , the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions			0
a further announcement will be made shortly			0

@entity7 and alliance of potential investors tabled £ 16million offer
@entity3 could take the offer , but @entity1 has other ideas
@entity1 attempting to oust @entity49 and ceo @entity2
both men are supportive of @entity7 deal
if @entity7 deal does *n't* happen , @entity1 is only source of finance for @entity3
