in the end , after 120 minutes , there were broken hearts and sweat - stained shirts hiding the heads of @entity6 ’s players			1
@entity6 did n’t deserve to go out of the @entity8 in the second round after this staggering performance at the @entity11			1
if this is how @entity13 want to win a fourth @entity8 then they can only hope to stumble across the finish line in @entity16 on july 13			0
@entity17 has a lucky , lucky team			0
@entity6 ( 5 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity47 7 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 7 , @entity51 6.5 ( @entity52 97 ) , @entity53 7.5 , @entity54 6.5 ( @entity55 78 ) , @entity55 78 , @entity56 6.5 , @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 7 , @entity59 6.5 ( @entity60 100 )			1
manager : @entity62 7 booked : @entity51			0
goals : @entity60 120 att : 51,300 ref : @entity64 ( @entity65 )			0
the world ’s second - best side were taken to extra-time , stretched to their limits by their powerful , muscular , resourceful @entity71 opponents			1
eventually @entity6 were undone by @entity43 ’s 92nd - minute strike , picked off by the experience and know - how of some of @entity13 ’s finest players			1
that was the difference between them			0
sure , @entity40 scored @entity13 ’s second and there was a late rally when substitute @entity81 crashed a left - foot volley beyond @entity30			1
the real story was elsewhere			0
without the security provided by @entity30 , @entity13 would be out of the @entity8			0
surely now he is the best goalkeeper of them all			0
at times he played sweeper , racing off his line to deny the exuberant @entity58 when he scooted past @entity13 ’s defence			0
@entity90 are next up for @entity13 in the @entity92 and yet we could so easily have been speaking of @entity6			1
they ran them so , so close			0
@entity13 ’s @entity96 defender @entity33 hit back at criticism of his team ’s performance			1
‘ would you rather we played beautiful football but got knocked out ? ’ he snapped , visibly upset at the harsh tone of questioning by the @entity103 media after the match			0
@entity107 : @entity26 celebrates after scoring the first goal against @entity109 beaten : @entity6 goalkeeper @entity110 ca n't keep out @entity43 's flick @entity112 @entity103 survive @entity6 scare ‘ i do n’t know what you want from me — do you think that just @entity118 teams are involved in the last 16 ? @entity119 is we ’re in the quarter - finals			1
’ @entity43 echoed his view , saying : ‘ @entity6 did a really good job			1
but it does n’t matter how we ’ve done it , the main thing is we ’re in the quarter - finals			2
there was a bit of luck involved in my goal and we ’ve got to play better against @entity90			0
’ there is a nagging suspicion that @entity13 are playing tournament football , with @entity17 ’s team keeping their opponents at arm ’s length as they prepare for the latter stages			0
@entity6 , by contrast were focused at the back and electrifying on the break			2
their fans made quite a racket , pulling on green and white head gear and waving national flags as they created enough of a din to drown out @entity13 ’s supporters			0
thunderbolt : @entity13 midfielder @entity40 scores the second goal against @entity6 screamer : @entity40 celebrates scoring the second goal against @entity6 blast : @entity13 coach @entity17 dismissed criticism of his tactics after escaping a group including @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 , @entity62 ’s team had every right to play with aggression			1
they ran like men possessed , spiriting the ball away from @entity39 , @entity38 and @entity40 in the centre of @entity13 ’s midfield during a commanding first - half spell			1
they had threats going forward , with @entity53 cutting his way through @entity13 ’s defence with his raking passes up the line			2
every time @entity6 threatened , that man @entity53 was providing the impetus from left back			2
heads up : @entity13 keeper @entity30 comes out to clear with @entity58 closing in for @entity6 on the slide : @entity13 keeper @entity30 clears the ball from @entity6 's @entity57 @entity180 : @entity30 @entity13 possess some of the finest ball players in the world and yet there were times when they were lazy and casual in the centre of the pitch			2
@entity39 , outstanding for @entity13 in their 1 - 0 win over @entity190 at @entity191 last november , looked sluggish alongside @entity36			0
eventually , @entity36 succumbed to exhaustion			0
where were the cute little balls from @entity39 around the corner to @entity40 or @entity36 that we usually drool over ? @entity13 are in need of a re-think , particularly with @entity199 ’s @entity32 , @entity200 and @entity43 itching to start			1
on the ball : @entity13 striker @entity41 takes on @entity50 of @entity6 @entity107 and pain : @entity13 's @entity40 celebrates victory against @entity6 down and out : @entity6 midfielder @entity49 after the final whistle @entity36 was forced off in extra-time , substituted because his tired legs could take no more			1
it has been a difficult season for him			0
the call for @entity43 came at the break when @entity42 was replaced by the @entity211 forward			1
@entity40 switched to the left and suddenly it all made sense			2
@entity39 provided cross for @entity31 to tower above the @entity6 defence and yet the outstanding @entity47 refused to be beaten			2
the @entity6 keeper saved again from @entity38 , pushing the ball over the bar just when @entity39 was starting to influence this game in a way that we have become accustomed to			2
in the end they settled for extra-time and @entity43 was sharp enough to react to @entity41 ’s teasing ball across the six - yard box with a somewhat fortuitous flick			1
@entity40 added another in the final minute of extra-time and then there was some glory for @entity6 as @entity60 scored an absolute pearl in the dying seconds			1
there was no time for a fightback , but @entity6 can be proud after quite a night here			2
for @entity13 , it was quite a fright .			0

@entity211 forward @entity43 broke the *deadlock* with *audacious* flick
@entity96 midfielder @entity40 *doubled* the lead in extra-time
@entity248 scored last - gasp *consolation* for @entity6
