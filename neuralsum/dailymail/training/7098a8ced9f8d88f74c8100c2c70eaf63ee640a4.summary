by @entity0 published : 15:47 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 6 august 2013 @entity2 ’s 87th - minute winner for @entity3 against bitter rivals @entity4 sparked ugly scenes which ended with a steward being trampled by two police horses and taken to hospital			1
the @entity10 derby atmosphere boiled over when hundreds of home supporters flooded the @entity13 pitch at the final whistle			1
@entity16 ’s side had booked their place into the @entity19 second round , but the significance of beating @entity4 in the first meeting for over three years became too much for some			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ a steward was injured by a police horse			1
he suffered damage to his shoulder and has gone for an x-ray			1
’ ugly scenes : a steward was trampled by a police horse as @entity3 fans invaded the pitch shock : the steward looks on in disbelief treatment : the steward was taken to hospital for a shoulder x-ray match commander chief inspector @entity38 said : ' the behaviour of those involved in the disorder and the behaviour of some people towards officers and stewards was absolutely disgraceful			1
' this was a very difficult situation which presented significant challenges for both the club and for ourselves and we were able to bring the situation under control quickly			0
the disorder last night was completely unacceptable and we will be making significant efforts to locate and prosecute those involved			0
@entity4 manager @entity53 was apoplectic afterwards and feared for the safety of his players			0
‘ it ’s an absolute joke , ’ he fumed			0
‘ who knows what could happen ? it ’s going to take someone to get stabbed or something else to happen before we ’re going to listen			0
‘ i wonder if there are enough stewards there			0
you see enough situations in football where fans are hitting a player			2
we sit down at these management meetings and talk about these respect campaigns , but what about getting enough stewards to control people ? abuse : @entity4 manager @entity53 and his son @entity78 are goaded by a fan as they walk off at the final whistle invasion : @entity3 fans head for the away end after the 1 - 0 win invasion : @entity3 fans rushed on to the pitch at the end of the match scampering : police running off the field after the fans have mostly gone on watch : police armed with batons along with some on horseback patrol the pitch @entity3 : @entity99 , @entity2 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 ( @entity107 69 ) , @entity108 ( @entity109 81 ) , @entity110 ( @entity111 90 ) subs not used : @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 booked : @entity104 goal : @entity2 87 @entity4 : @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 ( @entity126 75 ) , @entity111 , @entity53 , @entity127 subs not used : @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 booked : @entity127 attendance : 17,470 ‘ i can understand excitement from supporters but there are enough frightening things that have happened to players to clamp down on this			1
‘ who are the stewards anyway ? are they @entity3 fans ? if they are they should n’t be stewards			1
they just let people run on the pitch			2
it ’s not just @entity3 – it ’s football in general			1
‘ we need to knuckle down because you ca n’t have fans running on the pitch			1
i do n’t care whether they win , lose or draw			0
’ fans fell over advertising hoardings in their insistence to get as close to the @entity155 as possible			2
police tried to act swiftly to diffuse the situation with horses employed to disperse the crowd , but in turn flattened a steward on what was a sad night for @entity164 football			2
one away supporter managed to confront the hundreds before him on the pitch and while @entity16 was more laid back about the incident than his opposite number , @entity3 though are worried that they will now face serious @entity170 ramifications			1
‘ hopefully it was only supporters being boisterous and there ’s nothing too intense or any damage to anybody , ’ the manager said			2
‘ i ’m not saying i ’m pleased they did it			0
i hope not too many people were seriously injured hopefully in the next few days everybody settles down			2
’ an @entity170 spokesman said : ' we are aware of this and will be looking into what happened , including liaising with both clubs and the police to get a full picture of events and what preparations were in place			2
' @entity192 had been rumbling on throughout the day			0
a number of @entity4 fans did n’t even make it to the match and were escorted back to the seaside town by train			2
inside the ground , pipes were ripped out of the away end ’s toilets			2
jubilant : @entity2 celebrates in front of a delighted @entity13 crowd late winner : @entity2 's header gave @entity208 a 1 - 0 win a car had been set ablaze in the city centre earlier in the afternoon , although that has n’t officially been labelled a football matter			1
the football itself was drab			0
@entity3 manager @entity16 was facing his old employers for the first time since moving over to @entity13 but neither he nor @entity53 could inspire much creative spark and there was a lack of clear - cut opportunities			1
there were plenty of gutsy displays and a heap of endeavour but the dearth of quality indicated two sides still rusty and too keen on not making mistakes			0
there remained an edge to proceedings all evening and the lid almost flew off when @entity2 ’s thumping downward header from @entity104 ’ free - kick put @entity3 through			1
breaking free : @entity237 bursts past the @entity3 defence in the first half strong tackle : @entity2 wins the ball cleanly from @entity4 's @entity120 @entity16 added : ‘ it shows everybody what it means to this club			1
we played well tonight - kept our shape and worked hard			0
‘ they ’ve got good players and we knew we could n’t be gung - ho and go chasing the game			0
we could have got done on the counter attack			0
’ @entity53 called the defeat ‘ daylight robbery ’ but his son , @entity78 , was the only one to threaten for the visitors			0
but even he wasted a clutch of chances – while the hosts were largely restricted to efforts from distance until @entity108 ’s turn and shot forced @entity118 into a decent save			0
@entity125 , @entity127 and @entity123 all went close for @entity4 after the break but @entity2 proved the difference before the shameful scenes afterwards			1
@entity268 word : @entity16 and @entity53 have a chat before kick off			0
