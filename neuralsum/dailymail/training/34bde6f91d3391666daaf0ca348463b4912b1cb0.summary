elderly care home residents ’ lives are being put at risk because many staff do not give them enough to drink , experts warned yesterday			1
they were found to be at least five times more likely to be dehydrated on admission to hospital than those living in their own homes			0
residents who had not been given enough fluids by care home staff were also up to ten times more likely to die in hospital than patients who arrived properly hydrated , they said			1
some carers are suspected of not giving their patients enough fluids because it makes them more likely go to the toilet or suffer incontinence during the night			1
elderly care home residents ’ lives are being put at risk because many staff do not give them enough to drink , experts warned yesterday			1
file image used in a report , the researchers said the findings were ‘ disturbing ’ and ‘ distressing ’ and that conditions in some care homes may be as bad as those found by the @entity34 into the @entity36 hospital scandal , which found patients had been drinking water from vases			1
their warning comes at a time of growing concern about standards in some homes and the ability of regulators and social workers to ensure they are well run			0
these concerns were underlined last year when two unsatisfactory @entity52 homes were closed by industry regulator the @entity54 , one so quickly that residents waited to be moved for hours in their pyjamas on one of the coldest nights of the year			0
the study calls for strict measures in hospitals to check how care homes treat residents			1
if one elderly person at a care home is found to have the high sodium levels that indicate dehydration , the home ’s gp shoud be alerted , it said			1
if there is a second case , the @entity54 should be alerted			0
the study , published in the @entity73 , was based on the records of more than 20,000 patients aged over 65 who went into @entity77 hospitals over three years			2
it found that the official figure of just 200 elderly people admitted to hospital each year from care homes with dehydration was ‘ implausibly low ’			2
the main author , dr @entity84 , of the @entity85 , said : ‘ i have anecdotally heard that care home workers have been advised not to give too much water to reduce incontinence and people getting up at night			2
the study found care home residents were not offered enough water in what could be an attempt to reduce trips to the toilet ‘ it may be these workers are thinking they are doing the right thing			1
residents do n’t want to get up at night , they are at greater risk of falling and there is greater risk of being incontinent			0
’ along with @entity106 , of @entity107 , and @entity108 , of the @entity109 , dr @entity84 found that one in 100 older patients admitted to hospitals from their own homes showed high sodium levels			0
but among patients admitted from care homes , 12 per cent had high sodium levels			2
once the higher ages of care home residents and the greater possibility that they are suffering from dementia was taken into account , care home residents were still more than five times more likely to be dehydrated when admitted to hospital			2
the study explained : ‘ our findings are consistent with concerns about the quality of care in care homes			0
‘ care home staff do not offer water in sufficient amounts , either as an act of omission or , more perversely , as an active decision in an attempt to reduce incontinence and frequent requests for assistance			1
’ @entity143 research , it said , found there was a worse risk of dehydration when homes were inadequately staffed and workers did not speak @entity149			0
it said the link between dehydration and death in hospital was a matter of further concern			0
@entity157 , the minister for care and support , said : ‘ failings of care that lead to people being dehydrated are completely unacceptable and if it is being done deliberately then this is abhorrent			0
‘ the law is very clear – care homes must make sure residents get enough to eat and drink and we are making it easier to prosecute homes that fail to do so			1
’ @entity169 , of @entity170 , said : ‘ deaths linked to dehydration are completely avoidable and unacceptable			0
‘ older people may need assistance with drinking , and we need to ensure that care home staff are trained to help them drink enough and avoid increased health risks associated with dehydration , like confusion , low blood pressure and falls , which can lead to hospitalisation			1
’ dr @entity182 , the government ’s business champion for older workers , said : ‘ this is a problem that can be fatal – many elderly people die of dehydration , which simply should not happen in this day and age			0
