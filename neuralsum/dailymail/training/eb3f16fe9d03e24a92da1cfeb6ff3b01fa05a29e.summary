by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 07:40 est , 16 december 2013 the @entity1 has been accused of ' giving the game away ' last night after it cut to @entity4 winner @entity3 before his victory was announced			1
critics said @entity7 ' killed the suspense ' after he introduced the @entity10 champion ' just in case ' he won about five minutes before the result , but did not refer to any of the other nominees			2
viewers were also furious that within minutes of the public vote closing last night the @entity10 champion was being handed the trophy in @entity17			1
but the @entity1 has admitted it has a replica , which was sent to @entity19 when the tennis star announced he would not be attending the event in @entity22			1
his achievement , becoming the first @entity43 man in 77 years to win the famous grand slam , also led to him winning more votes than the rest of the nominees combined			2
he received more than 400,000 of the 717,000 votes cast but there was still criticism at the lack of suspense after the @entity1 's blunder			1
@entity56 tweeted afterwards : ' pleased @entity3 won # spoty2013 but did n't it give the game away saying @entity34 was with him before they announced the winner ? ' @entity61 wrote : ' did anyone see @entity3 pop up on the big screen just before third place was announced ? gave the game away a bit '			1
prized trophy : he received the award from @entity34 at his training base in @entity17 , but viewers questioned why he was introduced before the result and why the trophy was there already @entity75 said : ' someone is stood with @entity3 who ca n't be there			1
i think @ @entity80 told us who had won too early ! ' @entity83 added : ' glad they cut to @entity3 early , just to ease any nerves '			2
@entity86 wrote : ' awkward moment when the vision mixer cut 's to @entity3 too soon , giving the winner away , and killing the suspense '			1
meanwhile other viewers were bemused by the appearance of the trophy , which was likely stood next to @entity3 before his victory was announced			1
the 26 - year - old @entity95 , who was runner - up to sir @entity97 last year , was presented with his trophy by tennis legend @entity34 live via satellite from @entity17 , where he is in the middle of his training regime			1
@entity102 tweeted : ' erm ... @entity103 after a live national tv vote			0
so why was the trophy already in @entity17 ? ' reaction : viewers said that the moment that @entity7 introduced @entity3 before the result meant he ' told us who had won ' @entity112 wrote : ' so @ @entity1 , how did you get the trophy out to @entity3 in @entity17 so quickly ? i thought it was a open and fair public vote ? ' @entity117 said : ' very impressed at how quickly the @entity1 got the @entity118 to @entity3 in the @entity119 after the live voting closed			1
