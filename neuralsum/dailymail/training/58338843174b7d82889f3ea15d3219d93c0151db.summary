by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:55 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 11:29 est , 1 november 2013 with a global football icon for a father , it was hardly surprising that @entity5 has been a target for his old club			2
but despite @entity11 's son training at @entity12 this week , he will not be offered a deal at the club , @entity8 can reveal today			1
the 14 - year - old , the eldest of @entity11 's four children , was at @entity12 's @entity19 training ground on yesterday accompanied by his father			1
he has spent the last couple of days training with @entity12 's youngsters and took part in a practice match			1
@entity11 would have had to have gone some to emulate his father 's success at @entity42			1
@entity43 played 394 times for @entity12 , scoring 85 goals			0
he won six @entity47 titles , two @entity48 , one @entity49 and , of course , one @entity51			0
but all is not lost for the eldest of @entity11 's four children			2
the brother of @entity56 , 12 , @entity57 , eight , and @entity58 , two , had trials at @entity60 in january and has been training with the @entity62 ' academy - alongside @entity64 's son @entity63			1
the two played together in a friendly for their @entity68 team against @entity69 in september			0
his younger brother @entity56 , 12 , has also trained with @entity73 's academy			0
@entity11 had trials at @entity60 in january and has been training with @entity62 ' academy , notably figuring alongside @entity64 's son @entity63 in a friendly for their @entity75 against @entity69 in september			1
his younger brother @entity56 , 12 , has also enjoyed training with @entity73 's academy			0
the @entity11 boys have always been in close attendance to their famous father throughout his globetrotting career			2
they have often turned up at training , occasionally alongside illustrious team - mates such as @entity82 and @entity83			0
indeed @entity11 's football skills have been witnessed before at @entity42			0
he was introduced to the @entity42 ' crowd at the tender age of just two years old when he accompanied his father on @entity12 's lap of honour following their @entity47 title triumph of 2001			2
even then in front of the massed photographers he showed an aptitude for the game by scoring an impromptu goal			0
practice makes perfect : @entity11 trained with the @entity99 youth team when his father was playing in @entity101 back in time : the pair together when @entity12 won the @entity47 in 2000			1

@entity11 , 14 , has been training at @entity12 - *sparking* hopes he will join his father 's old club
@entity8 today said eldest @entity11 child will not be offered a deal
@entity11 had trials at @entity60 in january and has been training with @entity62 ' @entity113 alongside @entity64 's son @entity63
