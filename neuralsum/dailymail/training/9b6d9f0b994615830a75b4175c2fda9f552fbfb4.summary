politicians make good liars because they manage to convince themselves they are telling the truth , a study has revealed			1
and this has also made it easier to hoodwink the public because the best liars are the ones who do not realise they are lying , said the study			1
from @entity13 to weapons of mass destruction ( @entity15 ) , world leaders have been guilty of untruths whether it is blatant lies or honest mistakes , it claims			2
politicians make good liars because they convince themselves they are telling the truth , new research suggests			1
the researchers say examples include @entity24 ( left ) lying about his affair with @entity26 and @entity27 claiming innocence over the @entity13 which brought him down but they may have fooled themselves into believing , for instance , that @entity31 had @entity15 because it is what they wanted to believe , said political professor dr @entity34			1
other examples include president @entity24 denying his affair with @entity26 and @entity27 claiming his innocence over the @entity13 that brought him down			1
in each case , politicians may have been guilty of self - deception , dr @entity34 , of the @entity42 , @entity43 , told the journal @entity45			2
everyone has their own in - built lie detector but it is easier to spot someone who is lying deliberately than someone who is lying without , perhaps , realising it , she added			1
@entity53 has been found guilty of paying for sex with an under - age dancer , called @entity56			0
he denies the charges because of this , politicians not only lie convincingly , but are still convinced they are telling the truth even after they have proved to have lied , the report added			0
and it may be more common in politics that many realised			0
dr @entity34 said : ‘ self - deception is a type of motivated irrationality - the art of believing something simply because it is desired to be true when evidence points to the very opposite			2
‘ the more convinced is a political leader , the more convincing he or she appears			0
‘ a charismatic leader is persuasive in proportion to his convictions and faith ; a cynical , self - interested liar is more easily detected and can hardly become a charismatic leader			0
’ however , it may be that those who go on to become the most successful politicians are those who have most developed the ability to deceive themselves and to believe their own lies			0
she said : ‘ in order to sustain deception over time , one needs to be very alert , clever and consistent			0
‘ some evolutionary psychologists maintain that humans have evolved sophisticated abilities of lie detector in order to counter the possibility of others ' deception ; hence the most efficient way of deceiving others is to believe one 's lies			2

it 's easier for them to convince the public as they do *n't* realise they *'re* lying
they fool themselves into believing what they want to believe
examples include @entity24 denying his affair with @entity26
