well , they want continuity and stability at @entity3			1
it was perhaps fitting , then , that @entity5 marked his first game in charge with a defeat , a fourth in six matches to leave the @entity3 perilously perched one point above the drop zone			1
not even the re-introduction of top goalscorer @entity13 – on as a second - half substitute after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an under - age girl – could inspire a side who have won just once in 2015			1
@entity22 paid for that run with his job this week , but @entity5 must repair those ruins if his own cv is not to be stained with a first relegation in 28 years in the dugout			1
@entity29 scored a late winner to earn @entity31 all three points against @entity3 in the @entity34 encounter @entity29 struck from a tight angle in the 88th minute to earn his @entity31 side all three points against @entity3 the @entity39 striker shot past @entity40 and into the bottom corner in the dying minutes @entity3 goalkeeper @entity42 watches on in despair as @entity29 finds the bottom corner of his net late on @entity46 and @entity47 celebrate a hard - fought victory for @entity31 at @entity49 on saturday evening indeed , the @entity50 suggested on friday that he was ‘ relegation proof ’			1
let ’s hope he is also immune to criticism , for without wins the honeymoon period will expire far quicker than his nine - game contract			1
@entity5 , though , might have celebrated victory on his @entity34 bow had former @entity59 not spurned a first - half sitter			1
the home fans were jeering him before that miss. their cheers were laced with irony by the time he was substituted on 88 minutes after a dire display			0
within 30 seconds of his exit @entity29 was showing @entity59 how to locate the back of the net as he smashed an uncompromising winner			2
it would have made for painful viewing for @entity59 and @entity5 , especially as there was a strong suspicion of a foul on @entity76 seconds before @entity29 hammered his 12th of the season to lift @entity80 ’s side to ninth			1

@entity29 scored a late winner for @entity31 , which is shown by our graphic from match zone			1
click here for more @entity13 made a return to the @entity3 first - team squad as he took up a place on the bench @entity13 came off the bench in the 73rd minute in place of @entity104 after the club lifted his suspension and @entity5 said : ‘ the luck was not on our side			1
everybody saw it ( the foul ) and not the referee , but i do not want to complain			0
‘ i can take confidence from that performance			0
if @entity59 scores they have to take more risks and we would have got more space			0
it was a chance and a player of his quality should at least hit the target			0
‘ but i did not expect the goal from @entity31 because everything was under control			2
’ @entity80 agreed with his opposite number			2
‘ it was probably a foul but it ’s about time something went for us , ’ he said			0
‘ in the end it was a devastating decision for @entity3 because we scored on the back of it			2
‘ but i thought we deserved to win			0
we ’re heading for the best points total we ’ve had since we ’ve been back in the @entity34			0
you ca n’t ask for more than that			0
’ for @entity5 , this is no time for hard - luck stories and the 67 - year - old needs to draw on his experience – even though none of it is in the @entity167 top - flight – to avoid the ignominy of a first demotion			1
he did answer one career - long criticism with his first team selection , three strikers in the starting xi a rebuttal to those who suggested the defensive - minded coach would try to spoil his way to survival			0
@entity5 was an animated figure on the touchline in his first match in charge of the @entity3 @entity3 striker @entity59 takes on @entity31 's @entity84 on his return to @entity49 @entity3 's @entity103 holds off the challenge from @entity31 midfielder @entity86 @entity31 midfielder @entity87 turns away from @entity3 's @entity102 and looks for a pass two of those frontmen combined in the seventh minute to carve the game ’s first opening			1
@entity59 scampered down the right wing before locating @entity106 who , 18 yards out , controlled eloquently on his chest before smashing a volley down the throat of @entity82 , the @entity194 fisting to safety			0
@entity104 – the third of @entity5 ’s attacking trio – then sprung @entity59 clear with a headed flick but the former resident failed to silence the locals as he spooned woefully wide			2
@entity5 wore a pained expression at the passing of what was the sort of chance @entity59 would have dispatched in his pomp			2
and he would have looked even more horrified had @entity29 ’s header – from @entity85 ’s whipped centre – bounced inside the post rather than inches wide with @entity42 beaten			2
it had not taken long for @entity5 to vacate his dugout earlier in the half and the @entity214 spent the bulk of the opening period barking orders from the touchline			2
he had promised to run on the pitch and reprimand any players who did not adhere to his instruction , and @entity103 was very nearly the first to incur his wrath when one pass was jettisoned straight out of play			0
and he might have been tempted to bolt on and drag @entity59 from the action within minutes of the second half when a promising attack broke down following a feeble back - heel from the forlorn frontman			0
@entity13 eventually emerged to warm up just after the hour mark and was predictably the subject of taunts			0
@entity3 defender @entity100 had his match cut short early as he was forced off injured @entity100 hobbled off in the 12th minute and was replaced by @entity40 at @entity49 in the @entity34 clash @entity3 forward @entity102 evades a challenge from @entity31 's @entity237 midfielder @entity86 but the home fans soon forgot about his presence amid the injustice of the refereeing error which cost them a penalty and a certain red card for @entity40			1
@entity83 loaded a deadball forward from his own half and @entity247 inadvertently flicked on to @entity88 , lurking in the six - yard area			0
the @entity31 skipper , however , was denied a strike on goal by @entity40 ’s man - handling act but the flag was up for offside , the assistant having mistaken @entity247 ’s head for that of a home player			1
but @entity31 did enjoy a spot of good fortune seconds before @entity29 ’s winner when @entity76 was flattened by @entity89			1
it was @entity5 , however , who was left feeling flat .			0

@entity29 scores late winner as @entity31 win for the first time since *january* 18
@entity39 striker 's goal ended a three - game losing streak for @entity80 's side
@entity5 took charge of @entity3 for the first time since taking over from @entity22
@entity13 returned to the @entity3 side after the club lifted his suspension
