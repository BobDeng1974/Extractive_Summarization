people who are skinny fat are likely to *neglect* their health because they assume they are well *due* to their appearance
one in four skinny people have pre-diabetes , are ' metabolically obese '
skinny diabetics have a higher mortality rate than obese diabetics
they often have unhealthy fat around their organs
problems occur when people try to be skinny instead of fit
running without doing any weights is *surprisingly* a bad *decision*
artificial sweeteners are **damaging** to a person 's metabolism
a lack of sleep , high stress levels and not enough @entity331 are **damaging**
