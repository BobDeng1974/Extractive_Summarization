@entity9 had *n't* seen her father since she was a baby
sought him out on @entity17 in hope he could walk her down the aisle
they agreed to meet and had *emotional* reconciliation last year
@entity24 was diagnosed with cancer just days later
recovered from operation enough to give away his daughter
