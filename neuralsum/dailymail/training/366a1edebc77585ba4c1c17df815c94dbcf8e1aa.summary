by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 30 march 2013 bombed to pieces in a raid which could have come straight out of the film @entity4 , it was a stark symbol of @entity6 's rule over @entity7 having been broken and destroyed			1
the @entity8 , translated as ‘ @entity9 ’ , was the dictator ’s £ 25million yacht which was blasted during the @entity12 in march 2003 - and 10 years on it is still a stark reminder of a fallen tyrant			1
the 400ft boat , weighing 7,400 tons , could seat 200 guests under a glass atrium in the middle and even had a secret escape route descending down from @entity6 ’s room into a submarine launch pod			1
bombed : @entity6 's private yacht , the @entity8 , lies at the dockside in @entity25 on april 10 2003 blasted : the 400ft boat , weighing 7,400 tons , could seat 200 guests under a glass atrium in the middle it was designed to @entity6 's personal specifications and sumptuously decorated all over in marble , exotic woods , and with silver and gold fittings			1
measuring 350ft long , the boat weighed 7,359 tons and looked more like a smart @entity38 ferry than a private yacht			1
@entity6 's love for @entity8 was proved just five days before the war began			1
despite all the other urgent war preparations , he had ordered the yacht to be moved under a full naval guard from its normal berth in the far southern port of @entity47 to @entity25 's inner harbour in a vain attempt to offer it better protection			2
but it was blown up in @entity25 harbour by 500lb @entity54 bombs during the @entity56 invasion by two @entity57 with @entity58 ( @entity58 ) from @entity59			0
these ‘ @entity61 ’ @entity62 attacked the yacht on march 27 , 2003 , more than 20 years after it had been launched in 1982			1
it had escaped damage during the @entity65 of 1980 to 1988			0
in profile : @entity6 's presidential yacht took its name , @entity8 , from an 8th century caliph described by historians as a merciless potentate who destroyed any threat to his rule up in the air : a @entity77 @entity76 is pictured on the flight deck of the @entity79			1
it was @entity62 planes that bombed @entity6 's ship dictator : @entity6 was hanged in @entity85 , @entity7 , for crimes against humanity in december 2006 the f - 14s were flying near the @entity89 for a standard @entity58 reconnaissance mission when a @entity92 forward air controller asked them to attack the yacht , reported the @entity96 blog			1
the @entity97 had realised that radio equipment on the ship was being used for battlefield communication , although the vessel had never been used for military purposes before			0
the ship had already been hit by a shot from an @entity104 - a primarily anti-submarine plane - but it was missed by two laser - guided bombs from @entity107 , reported @entity96			1
however , on march 27 the attack was led by a @entity76 team of lt @entity110 and lt @entity111 , which dropped two bomb runs while lt @entity113 and lt @entity114 provided cover in the second @entity62 above			0
they then switched positions and @entity113 and @entity118 dropped their bombs , hitting the hull above the water			0
both planes headed back to the @entity123 with the @entity8 on fire			1
the team knew their attacks had not sunk the vessel			0
the bombs were designed with fuses intended for ground support , but not for sinking the ship - because they exploded before hitting			1
but the @entity8 was rendered unusable by the bombs and was decommissioned almost three months later before being scrapped at @entity25 in 2005			1
in 2009 the boat 's sister ship which was also built in secret for the @entity7 dictator went on sale for £ 17million			0
decor aboard the floating palace - originally called @entity6 - included @entity141 arches , dark wood carvings , deep pile carpets , and loose rugs woven in @entity146 's holiest cities			0
as well as other typically @entity148 features , including prayer rooms and ornate fountains , the @entity152 builders also installed gold - tap bathrooms , whirl pools , steam rooms , and hi - tech bathrooms			0
unlike the @entity8 , the @entity6 was kept abroad after it was built in @entity152 in 1981 and was completely untouched by the numerous wars @entity6 was involved in during his reign			1
the statue of @entity148 caliph @entity8 , founder of @entity85 , sitting in a dreary square in the city @entity8 ( 712 to 775 ) was the second caliph of the @entity166 dynasty and is generally regarded as the real founder of the @entity166			2
his father was a great - grandson of @entity170 's uncle @entity169			0
@entity8 wiped out the last remnants of the deposed @entity173 dynasty , and cut the @entity166 free from the revolutionary movement that had brought them to power			2
he achieved power with the aid of @entity179 troops , and he established his new capital at @entity85			0
@entity182 historian @entity181 in @entity183 recounts a number of anecdotes that present aspects of this caliph 's character			0
he tells of a blind poet on two occasions reciting praise poems for the @entity173 to one he did n't realize was this @entity166 caliph			0
@entity8 rewarded the poet for the verses			2
@entity181 relates a tale of the arrow with verses inscribed on feathers and shaft arriving close to @entity8			2
these verses prompted him to investigate the situation of a notable from @entity199 unjustly imprisoned and release him			0
there is also the account of the foreboding verses @entity8 saw written on the wall just before his death			2
a very impressive aspect of this caliph 's character is that when he died he left in the treasury six hundred thousand dirhams and fourteen million dinars			0
in 2008 , @entity211 1 had depicted the life and leadership of @entity8 in a historical series aired during the holy month of @entity215 .			2

boat could seat 200 guests under glass atrium and measured 400ft
' @entity61 ' f - 14 *tomcats* attacked yacht although it did n't sink
