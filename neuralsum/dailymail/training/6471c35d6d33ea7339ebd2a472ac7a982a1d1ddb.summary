by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:05 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 17:22 est , 13 january 2014 beleaguered @entity4 governor @entity3 faces a federal probe into the misuse of superstorm sandy relief money after his government supervised the funding of a ' @entity11 ' ad campaign featuring the governor and his family just weeks before his re-election , it was revealed on monday			1
@entity1 @entity17 officials are probing the use of $ 4.7 million of hurricane rebuilding funds on the self - congratulatory tourism ads. @entity21 is already under fire in his home state following revelations that at least four of his aides and political appointees were involved in a scheme to manipulate traffic patterns leading to the massive @entity32 in order to bring gridlock to a @entity4 town as punishment to its mayor , who refused to back @entity21 's re-election			1
a lower bidder could have won the ad contract , but @entity21 's mug would n't have been on - screen @entity21 daughters @entity50 ( @entity51 ) and @entity52 ( r ) also had their moments on tv , courtesy of @entity1 taxpayers @entity57 , the governor 's son , turned up on the @entity59 to appear in one of the ' @entity11 ' ads the @entity21 family on election night : three of the four kids shown here -- plus gov. @entity21 himself -- made cameos in the @entity70 tourism ads @entity4 @entity3 gov. @entity3 is under pressure following revelations that his administration may have closed highway lanes to exact political retribution against a @entity77 mayor @entity21 himself apologized on thursday for his administration 's role in the scandal and fired two long - time confidantes , while insisting that he had no involvement in the plot and no knowledge of it ahead of time			1
two other officials linked to the saga resigned in december			0
nearly $ 5 million in @entity44 rebuilding funds paid for the ' @entity11 ' media campaign , which included brief cameos by @entity21 and members of his family			1
at least another $ 25 million was spent on buying air time for the campaign			2
[ related federal investigators are trying to determine if laws were broken when a politically connected advertising firm won the contract to produce the ads , despite proposing a budget more than $ 2 million more than the next highest bidder – whose scripts did not include the @entity21 family			1
hud secretary @entity106 , an @entity107 appointee , presides over the agency investigating the @entity44 recovery grant -- but he praised @entity21 's ads at the time they weer first broadcast @entity115 , @entity4 - based @entity114 and a subcontractor billed the state $ 4.7 million to run this year ’s campaign			1
another firm offered to do it for $ 2.5 million			2
the governor 's administration determined how to parcel out the federal dollars once they reached the state capital			2
@entity21 critics in both major parties have complained , including one @entity77 rival who has the ear of the @entity107 administration			1
] @entity4 @entity77 rep. @entity130 asked @entity17 's inspector general in august to examine look into how @entity21 chose to spend the marketing money the federal agency approved			1
@entity130 told @entity134 that the @entity136 's preliminary review found enough evidence to mount a more thorough , months - long investigation into whether federal dollars were misused			2
a @entity17 official confirmed that the preliminary investigation took place , but would n't discuss its findings with @entity144			0
hud secretary @entity106 , however , defended the ads during a november 2013 hearing on @entity147			0
the @entity148 reported that @entity106 called his agency 's @entity149 ' a very flexible program			0
' the ads , he said , were ' clearly within the legal boundaries of what @entity155 has determined the program can be used for			2
' @entity21 also attracted slings and arrows from sen. @entity159 in november			1
the gang 's all here : @entity21 , the first lady of @entity4 , made a cameo in one of the ads under investigation the series of ads cost $ 4.7 million in labor costs and cost - overruns from a politically connected @entity4 firm and its subcontractors , but another company bid $ 2.5 million federal investigators at the @entity17 want to know if @entity21 can be held responsible for wasting hurricane relief dollars that could have been spent elsewhere in his state @entity1 rep. @entity130 , a @entity4 @entity178 , asked @entity17 in @entity179 to look into the legality of using federal disaster relief funds for a @entity21 promotion stunt instead of rebuilding homes destroyed by @entity44 apology accepted : @entity185 , @entity4 mayor @entity186 was targeted for political retribution with a plot to slow bridge - bound traffic in his town to a crawl the @entity193 @entity192 carped to hud secretary @entity106 in a @entity195 hearing that the campaign funded ' ads that included somebody running for political office			1
i 'm thinking there might be a conflict of interest there			0
that 's a real problem			0
... when people are trying to do good and trying to use the taxpayer 's money wisely , they 're offended to see our money spent on political ads. that 's just offensive			0
' sen. @entity159 , a @entity193 @entity3 who hopes to be the @entity192 presidential nominee two years from now , slammed @entity21 over the ads last year at the time , the @entity215 's top watchdog , @entity216 , told @entity217 that @entity21 's two - second cameos in the tv ads were no big deal			1
' i ca n't say it 's unethical , ' @entity216 said , ' because it 's not unusual for a governor to be involved in a tourism campaign			0
when you drive into a state , you see the welcome signs with the governor 's picture			0
the pictures are usually bigger in an election year			0
' the @entity32 scandal , dubbed ' @entity235 ' – although ' @entity236 ' might be more apropos – is threatening to derail @entity21 's future political career at a time when he 's considering whether to run for president in 2016			1
the deputy speaker of the @entity243 , democrat @entity242 , predicted on sunday that ' if it becomes known that the governor was involved and he knew about it and he knew about the cover - up , and he was approving the actions taken by his senior staff , that raises serious questions that the assembly ought to look at			0
' ' and that ought to be considered in light of what our responsibility is			0
the @entity243 has the ability to do articles of impeachment			0
' the latest trouble for @entity21 comes on top of the @entity32 scandal , which already threatens to derail any hope he has of claiming the presidency in 2016			2

$ 4.7 million from the @entity17 paid for a @entity70 ad campaign touting @entity4 's recovery
gov. @entity3 and his family appeared in the spots , and his administration awarded the contract to a politically connected firm
now @entity17 , *prompted* by a @entity77 @entity21 rival in @entity155 , is probing the *transaction*
another bid , $ *2.2* million *cheaper* , would have produced the *commercials* without the @entity283 ' cameos – just weeks before @entity284
@entity192 sen. @entity159 and @entity77 rep. @entity130 have both gone after @entity21 over the ads
the latest @entity21 flap comes as he 's *battling* back from ' @entity235 , ' a scandal involving the use of traffic patterns to punish a @entity4 mayor
