@entity0 will sit down with @entity2 ’s newest senior recruit on friday and remind @entity3 of his responsibilities			1
@entity6 manager and striker have formed a close bond since the @entity10 ’s arrival at @entity11 following @entity3 ’s turbulent breakthrough season			1
the in - form forward has responded with eight goals for @entity6 and appears to have turned over a new leaf after a series of incidents last year			1
@entity6 manager @entity0 ( right ) and @entity3 ( left ) have formed a close bond working together @entity2 manager @entity18 named @entity3 in his squad for the @entity21 qualifier against @entity22 ‘ he had some highs and some big lows , ’ admitted @entity0			1
i think he ’s learned there have been people who can help him and that includes himself and his family			1
‘ i ’ve had a few chats with him and i ’ll have another one with him tomorrow , first of all to congratulate him			1
i ’ll make him aware of the potential pitfalls			2
‘ it can have an adverse effect if it ’s not handled properly			2
i think he ’s got an understanding of how he should behave			2
i ca n’t complain about anything he ’s done so far			2
’ berahino burst on to the scene in 2013 , scoring a hat - trick for @entity6 in the @entity38 against @entity39			1
the kid who fled war - torn @entity41 as a refugee was suddenly an £ 850 - a - week , headline - making star and it appeared he was struggling to handle the fame			1
a £ 40,000 - a - week contract was signed and @entity3 was pictured in a large 4x4 , supposedly spotted canoodling with an ex-girlfriend of @entity48 ’s , and finally inhaling ‘ hippy crack ’			1
by the end of the season he was struggling to persuade @entity52 that he was worth a place in the starting line - up and there was talk of dressing - room clashes			1
the most public one was with @entity59 after the youngster casually lost possession in the 3 - 3 draw with @entity63 which led to an equalising goal			1
the 21 - year - old scores from the penalty spot for the @entity67 against @entity68 in october @entity3 has scored 10 goals in 13 appearances for @entity71 21s a change of agent and a change of attitude saw @entity3 start pre-season training early and he has never looked back			1
@entity0 added : ‘ it ’s a fantastic achievement to get a call - up so early			1
i ’ve had a few chats with him and told him that if he keeps on doing what he does on the training ground and living his life as he does then good things can happen			2
‘ i have to say i did n’t think such a good thing would happen so quickly			2
it can come too quickly if they do n’t handle the occasion properly and do n’t keep their feet on the ground			2
‘ we ’ll try and help him as far as that ’s concerned			0
hopefully he ’ll understand that and it is vitally important he realises this is a reward for what he ’s done so far			0
as long as he does n’t change the reward can continue			0
‘ his profile is now bigger which is great but it also makes life more difficult for him			0
everyone is expecting him to star in every game and that adds to the press we ’ll try to help him cope with that			0
‘ he ’s becoming a better player week by week			0
that ’s down to how he lives his life and goes about his training			0
good things will happen if he keeps doing these things			0
‘ there ’s always a bit of fear that young players ca n’t cope with everything that happens off the pitch			1
it ’s vitally important we help him as much as we can			0
’ @entity3 gave an interview recently which showed how much he has grown up			1
he is a committed @entity118 and religion now plays a big part in his life			0
he said : ‘ you get caught up in this world , you want to do certain things that really do n’t have a value			0
i am not perfect , i will never say i am perfect or the best @entity118 , but i try			0
‘ people out there will ask how can i be a religious person , look at the amount of stuff i did in the past			0
at the end of the day , you get judged for what you do in the past			0
‘ i try to be the best i can be , it is not easy			0
i just try every day and see where it takes me			0
