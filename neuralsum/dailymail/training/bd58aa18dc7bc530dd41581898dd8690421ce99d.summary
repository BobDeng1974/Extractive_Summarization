by @entity0 for @entity1 despite student loan debt hitting $ 1trillion this decade , going to college is still the smart thing to do , as the average student makes back the cost of their degree in 10 years , says the @entity10 @entity9 @entity13 and @entity14 , economists at the @entity12 , looked at data on college graduates and found steady growth in earnings over the last few decades			1
the average value of earning a bachelor 's degree instead of only graduating high school has been hovering ' near its all - time high of about $ 300,000 ' for around a decade , according to a blog posted on the @entity12 's site tuesday			1
higher ed : researchers at the @entity12 found that college graduates earn $ 300,000 more than high school graduates over their lifetime @entity13 and @entity14 looked at data going back to 1970 for the study , which was originally published in june			1
the record earnings took student loan debt into account on the balance , though the researchers acknowledge they did not count jobless or part - time workers with college degrees			0
graduates weather bad economies better than the rest , but college graduates experienced their worst unemployment rates in decades during 2010 according to @entity42			2
what 's encouraging for students with five - or six - figure debts are findings that a college degree pays off twice as fast as it used to			0
back in 1980 , it took more than 20 years for a graduate to break even on a college degree			1
now the average is around 10			0
this is in spite of the fact that tuition nearly sextupled from 1985 to 2011 as the @entity56 reported			0
payoff : @entity13 and @entity14 found that the time it took for a college degree to pay for itself dropped significantly over the past few decades college students should n't take this as a chance to slack			2
in a follow - up , @entity13 and @entity14 explained that in addition to paying tuition , those who take an extra year to complete their bachelor 's degree lose out on $ 37,000 in wages and earn $ 41,000 less over their lifetime			1
students who spend a sixth year can kiss $ 144,000 goodbye			2
the returns on investment for a bachelor 's degree are also not evenly distributed across every field of study			1
unsurprisingly , graduates with engineering or math and computer science degrees experienced the highest rates of return			0
the lowest was education , where the average graduate 's income amounted to nine percent return , only slightly better than investing those tuition dollars into the stock market .			0

@entity13 and @entity14 of the @entity12 studied data on graduate earnings beginning in 1970
a bachelor 's degree is a $ 300,000 value over a high school degree
college graduates now earn back the cost of their degree in around 10 years compared to more than 20 years in 1980
a fifth year in college can cost almost $ *80,000* in lost wages , two extra costs around $ 144,000
engineering degrees have the best return on investment , education the worst
