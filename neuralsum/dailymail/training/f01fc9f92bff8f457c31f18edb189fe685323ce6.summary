they described the operation as ‘ straightforward ’ and ‘ uneventful ’ , saying that almost 40 babies have been born from pieces of ovary that were preserved in liquid nitrogen			1
the leading fertility doctors said it was time the £ 8,000 technique was more widely used			0
a handful of clinics do ovarian tissue freezing in the @entity18 but they usually treat cancer patients			1
in an article in the @entity22 medical journal , however , the fertility doctors said it was now time to allow healthy young women to put an ovary – or a piece of ovary – on ice			0
the tissue would remain there until the woman is ready to start a family			0
it would then be thawed and put back in her body			2
@entity18 women already have the option of freezing eggs for medical and non-medical , or lifestyle , reasons			0
but collecting eggs to store for use later can be a lengthy process and when the woman is ready to have a baby , she will need @entity47			0
in contrast , taking ovarian tissue means a large number of eggs is collected quickly , and after the tissue is put back in the woman , she can try to get pregnant naturally			1
but critics say the operation could damage a woman ’s fertility and that while cancer patients have few other options , the risks are too great for healthy women			1
one of the article ’s authors , dr @entity64 , of @entity65 in @entity66 in the @entity67 , said : ‘ replacement of ovarian tissue requires surgery and might seem more onerous than egg retrieval but it is a straightforward and uneventful procedure			1
‘ with freezing ovarian tissue , a woman does n’t need @entity47 and her fertility ten or 15 or 20 years from now will be the same as if she was a young woman			2
’ dr @entity64 , one of the few doctors to perform the operation simply to allow healthy women to delay motherhood , said the frozen tissue could be transplanted back at any time – even 50 years later			2
the operation does not damage fertility , he added			0
commenting on the issue , dr @entity84 , director of @entity85 , said ovarian tissue freezing can be useful for cancer patients who in some ways ‘ have nothing to lose ’ , but that it should not be used to allow healthy women put motherhood on ice .			1

ovarian tissue is *removed* and frozen , then thawed and put back in
experts described operation as ‘ straightforward ’ and ‘ uneventful ’
process exists in @entity18 , but is normally used for cancer patients
women can already freeze eggs and then attempt to give birth through *ivf*
but taking ovarian tissue means a large number of eggs is collected quickly
however critics say the operation could damage a woman ’s fertility
