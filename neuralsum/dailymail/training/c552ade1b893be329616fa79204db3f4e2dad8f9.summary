by @entity0 @entity1 admits the @entity3 final was probably his last match for @entity5 but could think of no better way to end his time with the club			1
the @entity10 goalkeeper has spent much of his time since arriving from @entity12 in 2007 watching from the sidelines			2
@entity1 , now 29 , has understandably grown frustrated at playing second fiddle and is set to leave at the end of his contract this summer , having rejected offers of an extension			1
it was a decision the @entity31 may well have been cursing as @entity32 scored twice early on in the @entity3 final , although it was all smiles in the end as @entity36 struck in stoppage time to secure a 3 - 2 extra-time win and end @entity5 's nine - year trophy drought			1
' it feels great , it feels amazing , ' @entity1 said			1
' i do n't know how best to express my emotions but it feels amazing			0
' it was probably my last game for @entity5			0
i do n't know what i can say , but if i end my @entity5 career in that way then it is the best way to finish			0
' it is a massive relief because it has been a long time without a trophy , especially after that kind of game when we were 2 - 0 down in the cup final			1
' no - one was expecting us to be two goals down after 10 minutes and to produce that great comeback i think was a massive , massive relief			2
safe pair of hands : @entity1 has been kept out of the side by no 1 goalkeeper @entity27 ' hopefully the club can now kick on			1
i think this gives us or gives @entity5 the idea that those players can win trophies , that they are able to			2
' @entity69 may be joined by right - back @entity70 in leaving the club this summer , although unlike the goalkeeper the @entity74 right - back was unwilling to speak after the final			1
however , even with those potential departures @entity26 will be hopeful that @entity5 's first silverware since the 2005 @entity3 can act as a catalyst to further success			0
@entity81 did not have his greatest game in saturday 's triumph but has been a key member of the squad this season and knows just how important the victory against @entity32 was			1
' you win nothing for nine years so it is special for us , ' the @entity89 international said			0
' we have to come and celebrate now			0
all smiles : @entity36 ( centre ) notched an extra-time winner for the @entity25 against @entity32 ' for the fans , for the club , it is something special			1
you wait and wait for nine years and some people repeatedly said " @entity5 win nothing , @entity5 win nothing "			0
' it is a lot of pressure but in the end it is a cup game and , in the end , it can happen			0
we were 2 - 0 down and came back , it was a great match and we had the cup in our hands			2
' we have a great spirit in the team			0
everybody is a part of this and you see in the last matches we did well , getting fourth place and now winning the @entity3			0
' it was a special cup game because @entity32 fought great and played great but in the end we have it			2
