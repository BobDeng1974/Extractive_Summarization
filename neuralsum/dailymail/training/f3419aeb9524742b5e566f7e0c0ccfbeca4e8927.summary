it sounds such an all - action role			2
impact is one of those words that just conjures excitement in the brain			0
there is impact , a 1949 crime drama involving a cheating wife and a duplicitous husband			0
@entity11 , a 2008 television mini-series in which an asteroid sets the moon on collision course with earth			0
@entity11 , 1998 film , same thing but with a seven - mile wide comet making a pest of itself			2
and @entity25 , the fourth @entity26 movie and the one in which @entity27 actually says ' go ahead â€“ make my day			0
' will @entity31 's impact substitute be making anybody 's day in @entity33 ? that is the question			1
on his bike : @entity37 appeared in good spirits after @entity39 touched down in @entity40 on sunday flying the flag : @entity37 was forced to watch saturday 's game from the stands as he was suspended by popular consent the brightest spark in @entity39 's @entity46 friendly matches has been @entity48			1
mention his name , however , and the phrase impact substitute rolls off an informed tongue by way of reply			0
in training , @entity37 is said to have excelled			1
again the clever money is on his late introduction , when he can have the greatest effect on tired legs , certainly in tropical @entity59 on saturday against @entity60			0
this always presumes there is a contest to have impact on by that time			0
if @entity39 were losing by a slender margin , @entity37 or @entity48 could snatch a handy point			1
if they were losing by two goals or more , to claw @entity39 's way back against any reasonably competent @entity71 side would be tough			1
and if @entity39 were drawing ? that is where the impact argument falls down			1
@entity60 0 @entity39 0 , 20 minutes remaining			1
is @entity31 seriously going to gamble on attack - minded substitutions , just at the point when his opponents are quite possibly settling for honours even ? impressive : @entity48 has been the brightest spark in @entity39 's @entity46 friendly matches the creatives play from the start or , more than likely , they remain spectators if the game is at stalemate long into the second half			1
nobody would blame @entity31 for caution in those circumstances			2
if he gambled and lost the whole dynamic of the @entity93 campaign would change			0
so the idea of impact substitutions is bunk , unless specific circumstances dictate			0
the theory that @entity39 will play a game of containment for 75 minutes and , if that works , metamorphose into thrilling cavaliers for the final 15 minutes is so far - fetched it should be a film script			1
in the @entity106 version , the hero of @entity104 comes on and scores four goals in the last ten minutes ; in real life he looks glumly on as @entity39 and @entity60 play out time and shake hands			2
@entity31 sought not to lose in the tight match away in @entity112 last year , too			2
the score was 0 - 0 going into the final 30 minutes in @entity114			2
on the bench were @entity48 , @entity37 and the form man of the moment , @entity116			1
@entity31 brought on @entity118 for @entity119 , who was having a poor game , and @entity121 for @entity122 very late			2
early bath : @entity37 was sent off during @entity39 's clash against @entity125 and was subsequently suspended to the surprise of nobody he did not go for broke as the referee began checking his watch			1
he made one like - for - like replacement and another intended to shore up midfield			2
that is what managers do			0
these warm - up matches have been a missed opportunity , sadly			1
one of two primary aims has been unfulfilled and that was @entity31 's fault			1
he needed to find out about the best two youngsters in @entity142 and @entity37 - and yet on one count remains very much in the dark			1
@entity48 impressed in a cameo against @entity146 , was even better when starting against @entity125 and made a very good impression coming on at half time against @entity149			1
in charge : but has @entity31 missed a trick by not starting with @entity37 against @entity146 or @entity125 ? @entity37 , who knows ? @entity31 rejected the chance to start him against @entity146 or @entity125 and was faced with a young man so desperate to make an impression in that second game that he got sent - off and missed the final match in which he was ear - marked to start			1
and there is the folly of the impact substitute			0
by delaying @entity37 's involvement , @entity31 lost the chance to see him to any degree of usefulness			1
in the 1991 @entity164 semi-final with @entity166 , @entity168 manager @entity167 was told by the club doctor that @entity170 would not last much more than 30 minutes			0
he had the choice of starting him , or bringing him on			0
@entity167 chose to start him			2
' what if we were 3 - 0 down after an hour ? we would never know what difference he could have made			2
' tough draw : @entity39 were frustrated not to have beaten 10 - man @entity149 in their final warm - up match he told @entity170 to see what he could do in 30 minutes : and he won the game in ten			1
the myth of the impact substitute eschews another , more logical , tactic			0
get ahead and then consolidate			0
why ca n't the impact substitute be the diligent worker whose care sees out the game , once the most dangerous players have done the hardest part ? there is a reason the order of play for the singles matches on the final day of the @entity197 is so key to the captain 's art. front - load the team too heavily and there is a risk of rookies in the tail not being able to get over the line			1
put all of your best players down the order to finish the job and there is a chance they could be stranded out on the course , the competition over and their match an irrelevance			0
@entity218 was furious when this happened to him at @entity220 in 2002 when @entity221 kept all of his strongest golfers in reserve and @entity225 of @entity226 did the opposite			0
we know that football is about 14 players , not 11 , these days , but it seems almost perverse to concede that a player is a match - winner - and that is what an impact substitute equates to , after all - then keep him on the bench			0
it may be that @entity31 is gearing up to spring a surprise with @entity37 , as he did by selecting @entity239 for the first game of the 2012 @entity241 against @entity242			1
it may be that he thinks a slower tempo is the only way a fixture in @entity59 can be approached and young attacking players in a first @entity93 may run themselves out			0
yet it is always harder to work without the ball			0
@entity39 invariably tire in the heat of tournament competition because they do too much hurrying and scurrying , while their opponents keep possession			2
the greatest impact would involve addressing that historical flaw , a change that would be as startling as any seven - mile wide comet .			0

@entity31 needed to find out about @entity37 but has failed to do so
@entity37 said to have excelled in training but @entity31 did not start with him in the games against @entity146 and @entity125 and he was suspended for @entity149
@entity48 has been the brightest spark in @entity39 's warm - up matches
