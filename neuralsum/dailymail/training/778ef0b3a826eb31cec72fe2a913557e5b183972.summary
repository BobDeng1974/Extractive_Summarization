this is the inquisitive puppy who gave himself and his owners a fright after he got his head stuck in the plug hole of a kitchen sink			1
@entity7 became trapped in the discarded basin while he was out playing with his brother @entity9 in a @entity11 garden on sunday			1
thankfully the poor eight - week - old was released by vets later , after an attempt to ease his head back out using shampoo as a lubricant failed at home			1
@entity7 was fed a sedative and as he relaxed medical staff gave his little body a wiggle and his head slipped back out of the plug hole			1
poor puppy : eight - week - old @entity7 the dog was playing in the garden when he somehow got his head lodged in the sink free : it was only when taken to the vets that @entity7 's head was freed using a sedative to relax him owner @entity30 , from @entity31 , had to drive @entity7 - and the kitchen sink - to an animal surgery , where vets were relieved to find a sedative and a bit of manoeuvring was all that was needed to free the @entity39 shepherd rottweiler cross			1
' the pair of them were playing in the garden with my daughter , @entity44 , and she went upstairs to get changed into some old clothes so she did n't get dirty , ' his owner said today			2
' we heard barking and i thought something must be wrong because they never bark			0
' my daughter started shouting to me			0
i ran down to her and saw @entity7 had got his head stuck in the the wastage plug hole of the sink			2

she said : ' he did n't like that and my daughter was crying and panicking and i did n't know what to do			0
' luckily , he is the lazy one of the pair of dogs and he was n't really panicking			0
' they rang vets at @entity75 and bundled @entity7 and the sink into the car			2
