@entity0 must take his time before deciding whether to commit his future to @entity3 , according to his former @entity5 team - mate @entity4			1
the @entity7 skipper is out of contract next summer and is yet to sign a new deal despite being offered a contract beyond this season by @entity12			1
but @entity4 , who has forged a successful media career since hanging up his boots , insists that both parties must not rush into a decision before @entity17			1
@entity0 , pictured celebrating against @entity18 , is out of contract at @entity3 next summer @entity0 ( centre ) is yet to sign a new contract at @entity3 despite being offered one by @entity12 the former @entity23 defender admits that he is only just starting to have a clear idea of what he wants to do in the future as he juggles his role as a @entity30 pundit with coaching duties for the three @entity32 writing in his column for @entity34 , @entity4 said : ' @entity0 has entered the ' storm phase ' of his career , when big decisions are unavoidable			1
i can empathise because i 'm still in a fact - finding stage of life where he will eventually join me			0
' a footballer 's life is divided into two halves			0
from 35 - 40 the player almost becomes a 16 - year - old again , with a blank space stretching out in front			0
only now am i starting to feel clearer about how i want the second half of my own life to be			2
@entity3 's captain is entitled to think about his future with his main focus on what 's best for him			1
' this week @entity0 told @entity3 fans that he would speak to them when the time was right , which was a sensible stance			1
i ca n't quite understand where the fire is coming from on this issue			0
the idea that a 34 - year - old can decide his future before @entity17 seems odd to me			2
my take on it would be that both parties should sit back and relax			2
' @entity4 ( right ) , pictured with @entity67 , has become a respected pundit with @entity30 @entity3 boss @entity12 is hoping to keep @entity0 at the club beyond this season @entity0 can agree a free transfer to a club outside of @entity5 from january but @entity4 sees no reason for @entity3 to panic about losing their captain for nothing			1
' the fuss over the decision - making seems counterproductive , ' he adds			0
' @entity0 and @entity3 should be making a decision , i would say , around march or april next year			1
the club should have planned already ( or be planning ) for life without him			0
that would be true for any 34 - year - old , however illustrious			0
@entity0 , on the other hand , is approaching post-career mode in his thinking			2
as so many footballers find , there is no manual and no right or wrong path			0

@entity0 has been offered a new deal at @entity3
but the *midfielder* is yet to sign and could leave the club on a free transfer
@entity4 believes both parties must take their @entity98
the former @entity23 defender admits he is only just feeling clearer about his future plansÂ
