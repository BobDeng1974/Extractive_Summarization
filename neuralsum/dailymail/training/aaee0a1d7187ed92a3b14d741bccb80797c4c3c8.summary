a @entity1 space craft which helped paved the way putting man on the moon encountered a issue of a far more earthly kind this week when it was given a parking ticket in downtown @entity8			1
traffic officers were unhappy at the time it was taking for the two tonne 1960s @entity12 space capsule to be delivered to @entity14 saleroom and handed auctioneer @entity15 a fine			1
the capsule - which is considered a piece of space history , having been used in the testing of highly dangerous missions that resulted in the first ever space walks - is due to go on sale at the auction house tomorrow with a $ 50,000 asking price			1
no parking : traffic officers were unhappy at the time it was taking for the two tonne 1960s gemini space capsule to be delivered to @entity14 saleroom and handed auctioneer @entity15 ( right ) a fine not enough space : the capsule - which is considered a piece of space history , having been used in the testing of highly dangerous missions that resulted in the first ever space walks - is due to go on sale at the @entity39 auction house tomorrow a piece of space history : an image taken from @entity43 with views of @entity45 and earth , taken in december 1965 mr @entity15 said was taking delivery of the enormous capsule , part of @entity1 's ground - breaking @entity12 space missions , when he was handed the fine			1

the @entity12 missions paved the way for putting man on the moon with the @entity62 space programme by testing longer space flights and perfecting methods of re-entry and landing			1
following the success of @entity62 in the late 1960s @entity1 turned their attention to the space shuttle programme which resulted in the building of the @entity71			2
much of the redundant equipment from previous missions was sold off in the 1970s to create space for the new technologies to be developed and tested			0

mr @entity15 , president of @entity14 , said : ' these capsules were used by @entity1 to test how the spacecraft would react on landing			0
' seven were made in total for the @entity102 space missions , the second manned space flight @entity1 conducted , ' he added			0
' when @entity1 started developing the space shuttle following the @entity62 missions they needed space so they had a massive clear - out of equipment that was by that point redundant , ' he went on to say			2
@entity12 was @entity1 's second human spaceflight program , with ten manned flights occurring between 1965 and 1966			0
similar in design to the @entity102 capsule but much larger , the new gemini spacecraft was designed to carry two astronauts into @entity116 orbit to test long - duration flight , rendezvous and docking and other technologies needed for later journies to the moon astronauts @entity123 and @entity125 sit with their spacecraft hatches open while awaiting the arrival of the recovery ship , the @entity129 after the successful completion of their @entity132 mission in march 16 , 1966			2

when mr @entity88 died in 2000 the capsule was discovered rotting among his vast collection of space junk			0
it was bought by the current owner who set about restoring the capsule to its former glory			0
' it is in incredible piece of space history but any prospective buyer will have to have the space to house it - it 's 9ft tall and weighs 2.5 tonnes , ' mr @entity15 said			1
' there is a real market for memorabilia from the early days of space exploration , especially capsules such as this - they 're pretty rare , ' he added			0
' it would be a perfect tourist attraction for an institution but we 've also had interest from private collectors ... anyone who buys this capsule will have to make sure they can home it - it 's huge , ' mr @entity15 went on to say			0
the @entity12 missions paved the way for putting man on the moon with the @entity62 space programme by testing longer space flights and perfecting methods of re-entry and landing photographs show re-entry tests involving a @entity12 capsule and a paraglider in the early 1960s @entity12 was launched on january 3 , 1962			1
it followed on from @entity1 's @entity102 projects which put man into space and allowed @entity1 to trial longer flights deeper into space			2
astronauts were able to test methods of manoeuvring and docking with other space craft and perfect ways of re-entering the @entity116 's atmosphere			0
famous astronauts who flew on the gemini missions include @entity123 and @entity204 , the first humans ever to land on the moon , and @entity207 , commander of @entity62			1
