by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 14:39 est , 13 march 2012 @entity1 is today hoping to seal his status as the @entity4 presidential front - runner with a thus - far elusive victory in the conservative @entity6			1
the pivotal primaries in @entity8 and @entity9 come as a new poll appears to prove just how non-progressive some @entity4 voters in the region are			1
an astonishing 29 per cent of @entity4 voters in @entity9 believe that interracial marriage should be illegal			1
front - runner : @entity1 addresses supporters outside the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity8 , yesterday			1
a poll has revealed that 21 per cent of @entity4 voters in the state oppose interracial marriage , rising to 29 per cent in @entity9 this number falls to a still significant 21 per cent among self - declared @entity4 supporters in @entity8 , according to the survey by @entity26			1
in @entity9 , 54 per cent said they were in favour of mixed - race marriage , a figure that increased to 67 per cent in @entity8			2
interracial marriage has been legal across the @entity32 since june 1967 , when a @entity34 ruling banned anti-miscegenation laws then enforced in 16 states			2
today 's closely - forced primaries in @entity8 and @entity9 offer mr @entity1 a key opportunity in a region that has been slow to embrace him			1
the primaries are also poised to render a possible final verdict on @entity45 's @entity44 - focused candidacy			2
with polls showing an unexpectedly tight race in the conservative heartland states , mr @entity1 made a campaign appearance yesterday in @entity8 - a clear indication he is eyeing a potential win there			1
the former @entity53 governor campaigned with @entity44 comedian @entity54 and poked fun at his own lack of hunting skills , saying he hoped to set out with an @entity8 friend who ' can actually show me which end of the rifle to point '			0
meeting the public : the former @entity53 governor greets supporters inside the cafe still fighting : fellow candidate @entity45 addresses the @entity66 forum at the @entity67 in @entity68 last night battling to become mr @entity1 's main conservative challenger , mr @entity45 and @entity70 both spoke at an energy forum in @entity9 and took questions on religion in public life at a presidential forum in @entity68 , @entity8			1
they took sharp aim at president @entity79 , with mr @entity70 labeling the president 's foreign policy ' pathetic ' and mr @entity45 taunting @entity79 as ' president algae ' for an energy speech in which mr @entity79 spoke of research that would allow oil and gas to be developed from algae one day			0
mr @entity45 has focused his campaign in recent weeks on rising gas prices , promising to bring the price to $ 2.50 per gallon if elected			0
the @entity44 showdown comes as new polling showed a steep drop in mr @entity79 's approval ratings amid escalating prices at the pump and renewed turbulence in the @entity98			0
a @entity100 poll found that 46 per cent of those surveyed approve the way the president is handling his job , and 50 per cent disapprove			0
a @entity108 / @entity107 poll found 41 per cent approval , and 47 per cent disapproval			0
taking the stage : @entity70 speaks during the @entity112 at the @entity113 in @entity114 yesterday a win in either @entity9 or @entity8 would be an important breakthrough for mr @entity1 , easing concerns that the @entity118 - educated north - easterner can not win the party 's most conservative and evangelical voters			1
mr @entity70 , who has angled to campaign head - to - head with mr @entity1 , pressed the case again that mr @entity45 should consider stepping aside			1
speaking in @entity114 , he said : ' people of @entity9 and @entity8 want a conservative			0
if they want a conservative nominee for sure , they can do that by lining up behind us and making this race clearly a two - person race outside of the @entity6			2
' mr @entity70 planned to watch returns from @entity132 , which holds its primary on march 24			0
while mr @entity45 insists he plans to remain in the race until the @entity137 in august , his campaign 's survival essentially rests on winning both of today 's primaries			0
the former @entity140 speaker has pursued an all - @entity44 strategy , but he has won only @entity142 and @entity143 , the latter the state he represented in @entity146 for 20 years			2
a fourth candidate , @entity147 , is not competing actively in the two contests			0
@entity149 is also holding a primary today , but none of the @entity4 hopefuls campaigned there			1
mr @entity1 has more delegates than his rivals combined , and is amassing them at a rate that puts him on track to clinch control of nomination before the convention opens next summer			2
he has 454 of the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination			0
mr @entity70 has 217 ; mr @entity162 107 and @entity164 .			0

@entity1 is hoping to seal status as @entity4 front - runner in region that has been slow to embrace him
