by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:29 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:14 est , 12 december 2013 as millions of @entity4 flock to the shops and spend hours - or sometimes minutes - labouring over the perfect gift for their loved one , it seems that their efforts may well be futile			1
a new survey has revealed that nearly half of us are preparing to fake a positive reaction to an unwanted gift in order to avoid upsetting a loved one 's feelings this @entity19			1
from the ' long - suffering ' to the ' faking it face ' , @entity21 and body language expert @entity23 are here to help you decipher the 12 telltale faces you could be witnessing on christmas morning			1
not impressed : if your woman pulls the ' disappointed face ' ( left ) she is not happy ; while the ' long - suffering ' face ( right ) says ' thanks for the socks ... the same pair you 've bought me for the past ten years ' fuming : only 0.4 per cent of people have witnessed the ' rage face ' but it is the worst of the lot - and quite easy to spot @entity23 showed over 2,000 people photographs of the twelve faces and asked them to pick the ones they recognised most when giving gifts to friends and family			1
the ' happy face ' topped the list , with 64 per cent recognising it , followed by the ' love face ' ( 37 per cent ) and the ' curious face ' ( 19 per cent )			0
other popular faces were the ' omg face ' , the ' disappointed face ' and the ' fake it ' face			1
win ! men , if your lady displays this ' happy face ' it means she is delighted with her @entity19 gift what does her face say ? the ' love face ' ( @entity61 ) , which is the second most popular face , means she adores her present , while the ' curious face ' ( r ) means she is intrigued oh em gee ! the ' omg face ' means she is shocked , but in a good way the research found that , surprisingly , mum is the most likely person to be on the receiving end of the ‘ fake ’ smile , with nearly 1 in 5 people claiming she is responsible for the majority of unwanted @entity19 gifts			1
thankfully , amidst the faking , there will be genuine delight with almost two thirds of people claiming to see happy reactions from their gift giving efforts , and a third seeing a love face			0
however , it seems there is a degree of awkward uncertainty among some gift recipients with one in five claiming to have witnessed a curious face as the reaction to their gift			2
@entity23 explains : ' being put on the spot to open a gift in front of friends and family can be a stressful situation , so it ’s natural for people to ‘ fake it ’ in order not to hurt a loved one ’s feelings			0
not convinced : the ' faking it ' face ( @entity61 ) is one to look out for this year , and the ' styling it out face ' ( r ) probably means she does n't take your gift seriously behind the smile : the ' guilty face ' ( @entity61 ) and the ' suspicious face ' are two to look out for this year ' a lot of time and effort normally goes into buying @entity19 gifts , so it ’s probably the one time of year that a white lie is ok ! '			1
but how can you truly tell if someone is delighted or not ? @entity23 maintains that it ’s all in the smile			0
' when it comes to knowing whether someone is truly happy with their gift look closely ; the smile is usually spread evenly across the face , with a subtle display of upper and lower teeth and the eyes are narrowed slightly into a crescent shaped eye - smile			2
' on the other hand , when we perform a white lie , we are often guilty of over-acting ; look for over the top wide eyes and a wide open mouth displaying upper and lower teeth with a hand on the chest , ' she advises			0
so how do you ensure you do n't get a ‘ fake smile ’ ? men , take note			0
here are the year 's most unwanted @entity19 gifts			2
topping the list is bubble bath ( 37 per cent ) , ill - fitting clothes ( 29 per cent ) , ornaments ( 27 per cent ) and perfume or aftershave that smell awful ( 24 per cent )			0
women are more likely to want to bin the bubble bath than men , with over a third ( 39 per cent ) saying it ’s the item they ’d least like to receive , compared to only 18 per cent of men			0
for men its socks that are the most undesired @entity19 gift with 27 per cent listing this as the top no - go gift , compared to only 10 per cent of women , found the survey by @entity164			2
