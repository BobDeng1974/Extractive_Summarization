the inquest in @entity34 was told the father - of - two had been a competent paraglider and had been paragliding for the last couple of years			1
after assessing the ‘ benign ’ weather conditions on december 4 he took to the skies using his new equipment which he had bought just a few weeks prior			2
the inquest was told that the equipment had not been at fault and his death amounted to a combination of changing winds , turbulence and convection that had caused his wing to collapse			1
miss @entity23 fought back tears after the inquest to say that he had been ‘ an inspiration ’			1
she said : ‘ that morning was the same as every morning			2
i took him up a cup of tea and gave him a kiss			2
‘ i always said " be careful " and he would say : " but would n’t it be a good way to go "			2
he died knowing i loved him and doing something he loved			1
he would take any opportunity he had to go and fly			0
’ miss @entity23 said : ' i always said " be careful " and he would say : " but would n't it be a good way to go " the friend who had accompanied mr @entity9 to @entity32 told the inquest that they had met through social media groups relating to the sport			1
he told the inquest that they had parked their car and walked a short distance to the position from which they were going to launch			0
but he said he had packed away his equipment after misjudging his own launch and injuring his ankle			0
he said : ‘ the risk to any flying activity is that there is always a threat of an accident caused by the weather conditions , not doing the necessary checks , falling outside ability			0
‘ we took stock of the weather conditions and whether it was worsening or getting better			0
he deployed his equipment and i assumed he did the normal safety checks			0
he went into soaring pattern and soared across the front of the ridge			0
‘ he went went into hovering mode which indicated he was trying to come in to a landing			0
he flew across the face of the hill , gained a little bit of height and flew around and behind me			0
‘ i viewed half of his canopy collapse			0
he was flying forward , as he got to a level the whole right - hand side of the canopy collapsed under himself			1
it had half the capability of the wing			1
he travelled forward and down at speed at which point he impacted the ground			0
i did n’t see the impact			0
’ the inquest in @entity34 was told the father - of - two had been a competent paraglider and had been paragliding for the last couple of years he told how he scrambled to his friend before calling the emergency services and performing cpr			1
@entity115 and @entity116 and @entity117 were also called to the scene			1
the inquest was told that mr @entity9 had been wearing a safety helmet and a broken head camera was found close to his body			1
no footage of his fall had been recorded			2
post-mortem tests concluded he had died from multiple injuries including multiple bone fractures and a haemorrhage of the spinal chord			2
technical manager for the @entity132 @entity131 and @entity133 was asked to prepare an analysis of the incident			0
he told the inquest that mr @entity9 ’s wing had collapsed at a very low height which can occur if flying into turbulence			1
he added that the wind speed on the day had increased from 5 - 10mph to at least 18 - 25mph but ‘ could quite probably have become even stronger ’			1
post-mortem tests concluded he had died from multiple injuries including multiple bone fractures and a haemorrhage of the spinal chord he said : ‘ evidence suggests that the weather conditions seem suitable for flying initially but very rapidly become unsuitable			2
it is quite possible he was the first ever paraglider that attempted to top land that part of the hill in these wind speeds			1
winds can change pace very rapidly			0
‘ it is quite clear that conditions were changing very rapidly , it can very easily lead to getting caught out			0
with ten years flying experience he may have looked at conditions and noticed that they were changing			0
they were surprisingly benign to begin with and rapidly became worse			0
’ he added that another pilot had chosen not to fly after assessing the wind that day			2
coroner @entity164 recorded a verdict of accidental death and said : ‘ it seems to represent a very tragic accident			0
it is clearly a sport that with it brings some dangers , part of the exhilaration is the danger			2
it is tragic that some people end up paying the ultimate price			0
