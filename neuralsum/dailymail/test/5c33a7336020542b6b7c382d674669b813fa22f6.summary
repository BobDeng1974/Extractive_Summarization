there is a problem with @entity3 's top order and it is not an easy one to solve			1
do n't get me wrong			0
@entity3 's top three are exceptional players but the issue is that they are very one - paced and when the @entity10 bowling was so disciplined , that became a problem on the first morning of the first test			1
it is ok batting the way @entity3 did if they had got through to lunch on 60 without loss , but they will be exposed against better teams than @entity10 , like @entity18 , if they crash to 34 for three in the first session as they did here			1
as a player i would never worry about the pace runs came as long as they came			0
you are there to win games			0
but now i appreciate the need to entertain as well and the way the top three go about things might become a bit monotonous			0
@entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket on day one in @entity35 @entity32 raises his bat to the crowd after scoring his 22nd test match century at the sir @entity39 ok , if they stay in the runs will come and @entity3 supporters will be happy but it should be remembered that @entity3 have promised to play a certain way			1
you have to give @entity47 huge credit for battling his way back to test cricket but a bit of a risk has been taken with him because if it does n't come off it will look like another big decision that @entity3 have got wrong			2
as for captain @entity54 , he has been working hard with @entity55 and has opened his shoulder up a bit , but the pitched up delivery continues to get him out			0
@entity59 was unbeaten on 71 at the close of play as @entity3 reached 341 for five @entity32 and @entity31 lifted @entity3 's run rate and got them out of a hole having fallen to 34 for three @entity64 has got this big backwards movement so to get him driving , and dismissing him the way the @entity10 did , represented a sucker punch			1
then you looked at the way @entity32 and @entity31 went about their business and they were just that bit busier			2
you ca n't bowl one way to them to dry up their scoring shots because they both drive and they both pull well			0
thanks to those two and @entity59 , this turned out to be very much @entity3 's day			1
i was delighted that @entity59 batted so well on his return to the side			0
he made no excuses when he was left out of the side and said he deserved to be dropped			0
i like that , and i like a player like him coming in at @entity92 and taking the game away from the opposition			0
@entity54 is bowled through the gate by @entity96 for 11 on the first morning in @entity35 @entity47 's first test in 18 months ended in a third - ball duck as he was dismissed in the first over @entity100 and @entity54 are both genuinely good guys trying to do a good job , so when i received a text from @entity100 asking if i would have a motivational talk with the team on the eve of the test i was happy to oblige			1
i have always said that if @entity3 ever want any input from me i will try to help			0
it 's difficult to do that at times , being on the other side of the fence now with the media , but my heart is in @entity117 cricket and i want @entity3 to do well			2
it was only a 15 - minute chat at the end of @entity3 's team meeting and , while not going into it too deeply , i just tried to give the team a sense of perspective			1
@entity64 was third to go for @entity3 on the first morning as he was dismissed by @entity125 it 's difficult at times when you are in the bubble to remember what it means to be an @entity3 cricketer and i tried to emphasise that it is important , but you have to try to play down in your mind quite how important it is and enjoy the journey			2
and when @entity3 were 34 for three , i was receiving a lot of comments in the commentary box about my supposed motivational skills ! i replied that i only actually spoke to the @entity3 middle order .			1

@entity3 close day one of first test against @entity10 on 341 for five
@entity32 , @entity31 and @entity59 all played well to lead the *recovery*
@entity3 's top three were all dismissed *cheaply* to leave @entity3 in a hole
when @entity3 were 34 for three i received a lot of comments about my supposed motivational skills . i replied that i only spoke to the middle order
