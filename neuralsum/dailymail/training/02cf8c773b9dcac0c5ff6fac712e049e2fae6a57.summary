the fiancé of a young woman whose life was cut short as she waited for a double lung transplant is urging people to join the donor register and give others ' a second chance at life '			1
@entity9 died in march aged just 23 after a life - long battle with cystic fibrosis			1
miss @entity9 had been on the transplant list for almost two years but succumbed to the disease before a match was found			2
since her death her partner of five years , @entity15 has been raising awareness of the disease , which causes the lungs to become clogged with mucus			2
his call comes as data from @entity37 revealed that despite a 10 per cent rise on the number of transplants carried out in 2013 - 14 on the year prior , the shortage of donors means three people a day still die waiting for their call			1
' my message is simple , ' he told @entity47			0
' if people register as an organ donor they are registering to one day save someone ’s life			2
' @entity9 wanted a second chance at life , but sadly she never got it			2
' i do n’t want others going through what we have , because it could be so easily solved through having more organ donors			0
' if more people realised the lives they could save by doing this – surely they would n’t think twice , so many people could be given the second chance that @entity9 never had			2
' @entity9 did n’t want much , it was the simple things such as being able to breathe without being in pain and being able to walk her dogs – that ’s all she wanted			0
' miss @entity9 was diagnosed with @entity70 when she was just six - months - old			1
but at the age of 20 doctors told her , that a double lung transplant was her only hope , giving her just 18 months to live			1
at the age of 20 doctors told @entity26 her only hope would be a double lung transplant			1
they gave her 18 months to live			0
she fought for three years , but died before a donor was found			0
miss @entity9 is pictured at @entity78 with mr @entity15 and her family , shortly before she died ' my message is simple , ' mr @entity15 told @entity47			1
' if people register as an organ donor they are registering to one day save someone 's life			2
@entity9 wanted a second chance at life , but sadly never got it ' miss @entity9 inspired countless people to sign the @entity25 as she fought to survive long enough for her donor to be found			1
she fronted a national campaign for the charity , the @entity92 , @entity93 despite her drive to help others , time ran out for @entity9 she outlived their predictions , but her life became an endless cycle of hospital visits and medication			1
but the selfless 23 - year - old dedicated the time she had left to helping others			1
as she fought for her own life , she urged countless people to sign up to become organ donors , fronting a national campaign , @entity93			1
with the support of miss @entity9 ’s family , mr @entity15 has set up a charity in her honour – the @entity9 @entity112 – aiming to raise awareness for organ donation and @entity70 and help support the children in @entity32 battling the life shortening disease			1
so far more than £ 6,500 has been raised since miss @entity9 lost her fight			0
the charity is now working with @entity120 , where @entity26 received treatment as a child before turning 16 when her care was transferred to the adult @entity70 centre at @entity78 in @entity125			1
' @entity9 had great memories of her time at @entity120 and we ’re looking to hold wish days for the children there who are suffering from @entity70 , ' mr @entity15 said			1
' we also want to support the hospital ’s classroom by buying any toys or educational goods they need			0
' the @entity37 wants to increase the donor rate by more than 50 per cent by 2020 , and while mr @entity15 says he ’d like to think it would be an easy task he has to remain ' realistic '			1
' hopefully people understand the situation we 've been in and we can get them thinking about organ donations , ' he said			0
' you do n't need them when you ’re dead and while it would be amazing to think everyone is going to instantly join the register it 's an unrealistic wish			0
mr @entity15 has set up the @entity147 , in memory of his partner of five years			1
he is raising money to help children battling the illness at @entity120 , where @entity9 first received treatment ' we can all make a difference in someone else 's life and that 's an amazing thing to be able to do			1
' the more people on the donor register , the less time people have to wait for their transplant and the more likely they are to have a good recovery post transplant			0
' @entity9 would have been in a much better situation having a transplant three months after being put on the list compared to having one 18 months after being put on the list because obviously health can deteriorate when you 're that unwell			2
' @entity169 is trialling an opt - out system for organ donation in 2015 , which mr @entity15 describes as ' a massive step in the right direction '			1
he hopes it will eventually be rolled out @entity175 - wide			0
he added : ' if you ’re not a donor , ask yourself why not and at least consider it because the impact you will having is massive			0
what better gift to others than the second chance at life ? ' i 'll miss @entity9 every day but the trust is my way of making sure her legacy goes on			0

cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus			1
symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough , recurring chest infections and failure to thrive			0
as the condition develops , a lung transplant may be required			2
there is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long - term damage caused by infections			1
the most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs , and antibiotics to treat infections			0
the condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build - up of mucus			0
for a child to inherit the condition , both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene			0
in this situation , there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes , a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer , and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition			0
about one in every 2,500 babies born in the @entity175 are born with cystic fibrosis			2
as treatments have improved , the outlook for these children has improved dramatically			0
life expectancy remains in the 40s			0
