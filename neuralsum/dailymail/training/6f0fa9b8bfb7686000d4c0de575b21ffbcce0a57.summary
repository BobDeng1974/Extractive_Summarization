by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 14:10 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 16:40 est , 30 august 2013 the @entity1 judge who provoked outrage by sentencing a teacher who repeatedly raped a 14 - year - old girl to just 30 days in jail has today claimed that his paltry sentence ‘ actually upped ’ the convicted rapist ’s ‘ debt to society ’			1
in a written addendum to his sentence handed down in @entity16 on monday judge g @entity17 stated : ‘ had the defendant pled guilty or been convicted by a jury three years ago , he would have had a basis from which to argue for a minimum sentence			2
’ victim @entity20 committed suicide on february 6 , 2010			2
she shot herself in her mother ’s bed just three weeks before her 17th birthday			1
horror : @entity20 , pictured , shot herself dead in her mother 's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail controversial : judge @entity29 sentence has sparked outrage and will be reviewed teacher : @entity32 , 54 , lost his house , his job , his teaching license and his wife as a result of the charges			1
his lawyer suggested , and the judge seemed to agree on monday , that he had been ' punished enough ' according to her mother , @entity43 , the pending trial of teacher @entity45 - 49 when the rapes were committed - and trauma of the abuse were ‘ major factors ’ in her daughter ’s death			1
speaking to @entity52 mrs @entity43 said that her daughter had been ‘ in hell , ’ shunned by classmates and bullied following the revelations of the abuse			2
her death complicated the prosecution of former @entity60 teacher @entity32 , now 54 , who was arrested and charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in 2008			1
prosecutors who had sought to put @entity66 behind bars instead settled for a three - year deferred prosecution			0
according to the terms of the agreement the case would be dismissed after this term if @entity32 pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and entered a three - stage sex offender treatment program			2
but in december 2012 the case was revived when it transpired that @entity32 had violated the terms of the program , having contact with minors and engaging in a sexual relationship [ not with a minor ] without informing his counselor			1
in his written explanation @entity85 maintained that these violations were ‘ not significant ’			0
he stated : ‘ there were violations of the treatment program , but involved no violence , no inappropriate sexual conduct , and no new criminal activity			2
‘ @entity95 ’s old treatment provider recommended that the defendant still be assessed as a low risk offender and treatable in the community			0
critic : @entity43 , @entity20 's mother criticized the judge 's apology as ' meaningless ' ‘ knowing that the @entity95 had enrolled in another sexual offender treatment program , the @entity16 is faced with deciding if the defendant should go to prison for relatively minor infractions			1
’ judge @entity17 went on to state that there was other information that could not be publicly released but had played a part in the court ’s decision : a july 2013 pre-sentence report from the @entity113 , an august 2009 psychological / psychosocial evaluation of @entity115 , and two interviews with the victim in 2009			0
judge @entity17 was forced to apologize for his comments in court , in which he claimed that the victim was ‘ older than her chronological years ’ and ‘ in control of the situation ’ in which she was raped in @entity32 ’s car , his then marital home and on school premises			1
similarly he drew fierce criticism when appearing to diminish the crime as , in defending his sentence , he said : ‘ i think people have in mind that this was some violent , forcible , horrible rape ... but it was n’t this forcible , beat up rape			0
’ in his addendum he conceded : ‘ rape under any circumstances is a horrible violent offense			0
some involved physical beatings , broken bones			0
others , as here , involve young victims legally not capable of consenting			0
all are traumatic and all are crimes			0
’ though he stated that he believed a prison sentence to be ‘ appropriate ’ in this case @entity85 stood by his decision to suspend all but 31 days of @entity115 ’s 15 years plus one day ’s credit for time served			1
he said : ‘ based on all circumstances , the @entity16 upped mr @entity32 ’s debt to society from the almost expired three years @entity157 to the 15 years suspended sentence			1
’ @entity32 ’s sentence puts him on probation for 15 years and requires him to finish sex - offender treatment and to register as a convicted sex offender			2
@entity165 prosecutor @entity164 is still reviewing the sentence with a view to finding some legal grounds for appeal , and judge @entity17 ’s explanation and defense of his decision will do little to silence the voices of those clamoring for his resignation			0
' bad form ' : judge @entity17 is running for re-election next year			0
protestors vowed to ensure he does n't receive a fifth term tens of thousands have signed an online petition calling for him to be removed from his post and yesterday hundreds protested his sentence outside @entity184			1
speaking to @entity186 ’s mother said : ‘ @entity32 took away everything beautiful in my life and he just gets to walk away			1
‘ with this sentence the judge just lets everyone off – he lets the school off and he lets him off			0
