you might need to dig out those sunglasses earlier than expected this year			0
scientists believe there is a 75 per cent chance that 2014 will be the hottest on record			1
that ’s because the menacing @entity8 weather pattern seems to be ready to blow huge amounts of heat into the atmosphere			2
the image shows what happens when a @entity8 strikes surface waters in the equatorial @entity16			1
warm water anomalies ( red ) develop in the @entity18			0
winds that normally blow in a westerly direction weaken allowing the easterly winds to push the warm water up against the @entity23 an @entity8 occurs when equatorial @entity16 waters are unusually warm			1
it can change ocean and wind currents across the globe , wreaking havoc on the climate			1
scientists in @entity32 now believe they can forecast disruptive @entity8 events a year in advance , according to a study in @entity36			1
they hope the forecast could allow countries to develop better strategies that can counter the devastating effects of an @entity8 event			1
scientists commonly forecast @entity8 , which means ‘ little boy ’ in @entity44 , about six months in advance , but long - term predictions have so far been tricky			1
scientists in @entity32 recently said they can forecast disruptive @entity8 events a year in advance			1
they hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires , pictured in the @entity52			0
meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 @entity8 will be firmed up ' in the next month or two ' during an @entity8 event the trade winds weaken			2
warm , nutrient - poor water is not pushed westward and comes to occupy the entire tropical @entity16			2
the cold water is not forced to the surface and the coastal waters of @entity61 and @entity62 are unusually warm			1
this warmer water has a devastating impact on their fishing crops which rely on cool waters to thrive			0
the region also experiences an extremely higher than average amounts of rainfall			0
the name @entity8 is believed to have been coined in the 19th century after @entity61 fisherman observed it around @entity74			0
the word is @entity44 for ' boy ' in reference to the infant @entity78			0
up until now , scientists have forecast the event by analysing water temperatures in the eastern @entity16 , along the equator			1
but because water temperature is strongly influenced by the winds blowing across the equator , predictions have been limited to six months or less			0
instead of analysing the water temperature in a specific area of the @entity16 , @entity89 of @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity32 , and his colleagues looked at the atmospheric temperatures in all areas of the @entity16			1
they then looks at how the temperatures in the @entity8 basin are linked to the temperatures in the rest of the @entity16 area			2
the researchers claim their method correctly predicted the absence of @entity8 events over the past two years , and forecast about a 75 per cent chance of an @entity8 in late 2014			1
climatologist @entity106 at the @entity107 in @entity108 , told @entity109 that the methods the researchers employed were outdated			0
‘ the techniques the researchers used made me feel like i was back in the 1980s and 1990s , ’ mr @entity106 said in an interview			0
the warmer - than - average sea surface temperatures in the eastern @entity16 are seen in this map of ocean temperatures taken by satellite in 2006			2
@entity120 spots are where temperatures are warmer than normal a separate study has found that extreme weather events fuelled by @entity125 are expected to double			0
climate scientists warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts , fires and foods every ten years			0
extreme @entity8 events develop differently from standard @entity132 , which first appear in the @entity16			1
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the equatorial @entity16			1
others argue that this approach does not look at the physics of the seas or atmosphere , but only looked for statistical patterns in temperature – which they claim can always be found if you look hard enough			0
‘ the risk of an @entity8 event in the second half of 2014 has increased , but it 's certainly not guaranteed at this point in time , ’ said @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 at @entity148 's @entity147			2
mr @entity144 said early indications suggested that the weather pattern could arrive as early as june , though the prospect would not become clear until the second quarter			0
last month , a separate study found that extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong @entity125 are expected to double			2
climate scientists warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts , wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years			0
an international team of scientists from the @entity165 ( @entity166 ) , the @entity167 @entity168 and @entity169 , has spotted a link between global warming and extreme @entity8 events			1
‘ we currently experience an unusually strong @entity8 event every 20 years			2
our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years , ’ said @entity173 of @entity166 , who co-authored the study .			0
