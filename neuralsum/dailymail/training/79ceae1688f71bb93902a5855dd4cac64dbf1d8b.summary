looking for love : millions of singletons will be looking for their perfect date online this week with dating websites reporting a surge in users in the period between @entity8 and @entity9 it may be the annual onslaught of loved ones questioning your single status over @entity8 dinner or the pressure to find that special someone to kiss at midnight on @entity18			1
but it seems that the post @entity8 slump is the time to find romance online with the period between @entity24 and the turn of the year the busiest stretch for online dating sites			1
some websites have reported an increase in traffic as high as 350 per cent with some of the most popular sites bombarding singletons with adverts to convince them that 2013 , or even the tail end of 2012 , could be their time to be lucky in love			2
@entity38 expects a staggering three million email messages to be sent by users this week with a further 2.5million ' winks ' sent and 500,000 instant messaging conversations taking place			1
traffic to some of the most popular sites including @entity46 and @entity38 has a tendency to peak at the startof january			2
according to @entity48 , of the @entity49 , the reason for the surge in people signing up to dating websites is down to singletons taking stock of their lot at the end of another year			0
he told the @entity59 : ' @entity8 tends to be a period of review and revision , partly because it gives you the chance to observe existing models of relationship – the ones that you have , the ones you want to avoid and the ones you want to emulate			0
' it is also the winter pause when you review what has been missing in your life and what you want in it , and a period of great loneliness for people who do n't fit into the government - approved vision of family			0
' many sense they want a crack at feeling better than they did in the preceding 12 months			0
' the surge in interest surrounding online dating comes as the @entity87 becomes somewhat less snobby about the way we meet our perfect mate			1
according to @entity93 , one in five relationships in the @entity87 now begins online , and meeting via the internet is the third most popular way to find a date behind ' through friends ' or making acquaintance at a pub or bar			1
improving standards : dating websites such as @entity38 have met with the @entity104 to discuss industry - wide behaviour standards ' shopping ' mentality : browsing dating websites online can lead to singletons becoming excessively picky when looking for their perfect partner according to a university study nearly half of the @entity87 's singletons are also thought to have dabbled with dating online at some stage too			1
so it 's little wonder that in 2011 dating websites were big business , bringing some £ 170million to the @entity87 economy - an upsurge of six per cent on the previous year			2
and the @entity87 is leaps and bounds ahead of its @entity123 neighbours when it comes to web dating with 1,500 of the continent 's 5,000 dating websites originating in @entity87			2
but it 's not all good news for those looking for the perfect partner online - interest wanes significantly when people return to work in the @entity133			0
a study from the @entity135 in the @entity136 earlier this year said that dating websites are making people more judgemental			0
browsing through profiles on dating websites is said to result in a ' shopping ' mentality making people excessively picky according to the study .			0
