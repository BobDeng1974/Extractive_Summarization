parents who have agonised over getting their children into the best school may have been wasting their time and effort			1
surrounding a child with brighter peers could actually damage his or her education , researchers warn			1
they said constantly being outshone in the classroom by brainboxes could shatter their confidence so much that they end up doing worse academically			1
findings : weaker children may be better off at lower performing schools , research from the @entity16 has shown so weaker students – both boys and girls – might be better off at a less competitive school as they have the psychological advantage of being a ‘ bigger fish in a smaller pond ’			1
being a competent pupil in such a setting can help ‘ motivate ’ children and lead to ‘ confidence , resilience and perseverance ’ , according to the findings			0
bright children , however , tend to thrive as they move through their school careers because they are already filled with self - confidence			1
this positive side of the phenomenon affects both sexes although it is far more pronounced in boys , according to the paper from the @entity16			1
similar levels : both sexes seem to suffer when they are surrounded by brighter pupils , the study found ( library image ) the gain was said to be similar to a child who is the best in their street at football and ‘ becomes more confident and spends more time playing and so further improves ’			1
dr @entity51 , a post-doctoral research fellow in economics , said : ‘ our findings go against the common assumption that having better peers is always the best for children			2
previously we thought there were no negative effects			0
‘ but just making it into a better school and being at the bottom end of the ranks can have a negative effect			0
’ the research looked at almost 2.3million @entity68 pupils taking national curriculum tests in maths , @entity68 and science			0
assessments for those aged 11 ( @entity74 ) were used as a benchmark of ability while those for 14 - year - olds ( @entity79 ) were used to rate how well they did at secondary school			2
the project also used a survey on confidence taken by 15,000 pupils			0
the data revealed those near the top of their class in primary school continued to improve while those who struggled often did worse			2
the upward trend was stronger for boys but the same for both genders in pupils from deprived backgrounds			0
the ratings for both boys and girls in the bottom quarter of performance at primary dropped at secondary level			0
dr @entity51 said parents could follow up the conclusions by flagging up a struggling pupil ’s strong areas eg that they were ahead of others in the area or were doing well according to national ratings .			0

surrounding a child with ' brainboxes ' could mean they do worse academically , research has found
weaker students – both boys and girls – might be better off at a less competitive school , a paper from the @entity16 claims
bright children thrive as they move through school because they are already self - confident , it is also *suggested*
