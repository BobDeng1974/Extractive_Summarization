by @entity0 the @entity1 go in search of their first ever @entity4 trophy on @entity5 on saturday and @entity6 is confident they can upset the odds at home			1
the @entity1 face @entity9 in the last four , with @entity10 and @entity12 meeting in the other semi-final tie at @entity14 but despite their consistent form across all three formats this season - they are third in the @entity17 and in the quarter - finals of the @entity19 insists his side are underdogs			1
the 25 - year - old all - rounder , who has taken four wickets and scored 28 runs in four @entity4 matches this season , said : ' you could say we just snuck in the back door , qualifying fourth in the group			0
but you could also say we peaked at the right time			0
high fives : the @entity1 beat the @entity34 in the @entity35 first semi-final : @entity9 v @entity37 ( 11am ) second semi : @entity10 v @entity12 ( 2.30pm ) final at 6.45pm ' it 's my first finals day			1
i have been as a spectator before but never as a player			0
' it should be a great experience and anyone can win it on the day - it 's just whoever turns up			0
' we face @entity9 in the semi-finals and they have some world - class players throughout their team			1
it 's on our home ground as well , and we have to take some confidence from that			0
' @entity10 have been very strong this year and on paper they are probably most people 's favourite for the title			1
@entity12 have some big players coming back though - particularly in @entity64 and @entity65 - so they will be no pushovers			1
' whoever qualifies from that other semi-final is going to be a tough task			0
but we have to concentrate on @entity9 first			2
' opening up : having @entity70 and @entity71 ( below ) at the top of the order gives the @entity1 confidence hopeful : @entity6 could return for the @entity1 but @entity76 ( right ) is sweating on a place despite @entity6 trying to play down their chances , the @entity1 have their fair share of match winners including @entity76 , who despite his reputation for slow batting and limited involvement in this year â€™s competition used to be regarded as a @entity4 specialist			1
@entity6 added : ' if he plays then we know he can and will do the business			2
he is excellent in and around the camp and he gives the other guys in the side confidence - and most importantly he just keeps scoring runs for us			0
' but let 's not forget we also have @entity93 who is a world - class operator , too			2
' then , with guys like ( @entity70 ) @entity70 and ( @entity96 ) @entity71 opening the batting , or ( @entity99 ) @entity98 providing us with some crucial off - spin bowling , we have to be confident			1
