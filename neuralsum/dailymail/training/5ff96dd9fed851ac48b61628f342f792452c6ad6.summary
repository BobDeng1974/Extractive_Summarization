by @entity1 reporter published : 13:11 est , 7 february 2014 @entity3 : 14:58 est , 7 february 2014 even some of the tracks for the @entity6 are n't complete , and those that are , come up short			1
course workers added 40 meters ( 130 feet ) to the biathlon track for the @entity6 on friday because it was too short			1
the loop should measure 2.5 kilometers ( 1.6 miles )			1

coming up short : workers prepare the track at @entity13 inear @entity18 , @entity19			1
officials found the @entity22 track to be 130 feet too short and had to make some last minute adjustments ' we had an issue with the length but we made a change , which takes care of it , ' biathlon 's technical delegate at the @entity26 , @entity24 , said			1
first doubts about the track length came from the @entity36 team , and they proved right after @entity38 officials measured the course on thursday			1
on the @entity42 circuit , most courses are inspected four days before the actual competition though @entity45 rules are different , leaving organizers less time for adaptions if needed			2
' it 's much too late and it creates issues , ' @entity24 said			2
' all of us feel it 's the right thing to do and we still have ( one ) day before racing			2
' the venue hosted a @entity42 biathlon event last year but the shape of the course has been modified since			1
ready for action : the biathlon winter sport combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting the new part of the track will be used in the women 's @entity65 on sunday , and after that in the women 's 12.5k mass start , the men 's 12.5k pursuit and the three relays			1
@entity74 head coach @entity73 told @entity75 he was ' a little surprised it was a little on the short side			2
' ' it 's still the @entity26 , so they should have measured that before , ' @entity73 said			2
' five percent ( deviation ) is allowed but this felt like a @entity81 ( for the women 's @entity65 )			0
it was the right decision they corrected it			0
everybody is happy with that			0
' another change to the track moved the starting line back by more than 30 meters			1
in the initial course set , athletes were not given enough time to speed up from the start before approaching a steep hill			0
@entity73 called the course ' super tough			0
it will be a big fight			0
' ' in some courses on the @entity42 you have big climbs and then you have quite some recovery , ' @entity73 said			0
' here you 're down to the bottom in a tough downhill , so you do n't recover the legs and then you have a long , long climb			0
' expense : the most expensive olympic games are now underway			0
@entity26 in @entity18 , have been plagued by complaints of poor organisation and infrastructure			0
