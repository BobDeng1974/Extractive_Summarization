by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 1 august 2013 it may be in the same retail group as high - fashion @entity3 and @entity4 but for years @entity5 has been languishing in the style doldrums			2
the @entity8 chain owned by sir @entity10 's @entity9 has been regarded as a place for women of a certain age seeking comfortable clothing and practical homewear			1
today the brand has unveiled a slick new collection for next season , and it looks set to give the most glamorous of its @entity8 competitors a run for their money			2
they 're back ! @entity5 have had a style overhaul and unveiled a fresh and slick new a / @entity26 collection ( coat £ 65 , blouse £ 22 , skirt £ 26 , croc clutch £ 20 , leather gloves £ 18 ) wearable : the store hope their new collection evokes simplicity , elegance and sophistication ( l - belted coat £ 65 , bag £ 28 , r - biker jacket £ 55 , roll neck £ 10 , jeans £ 22 ) the new range is designed to evoke ' simplicity , elegance and sophistication ' and the store say they hope to offer ' modern - day ladylike glamour combined with structured fits and clean lines '			1
and all with a purse - friendly price tag			0
' @entity50 is a measured mix of clever pieces and wardrobe essentials that have created a very wearable and confident collection designed to suit every woman , ' say the store			1
easy to wear monochrome is key and comes in the form of stripes , geometrical prints , florals and bold mono - blocking			0
and for the more adventurous there are plenty of subtle colour injections with tones of emerald , claret , rust , teal and cobalt			0
fashion forward : monochrome and checks are key to the collection and come in the form of stripes , geometrical prints and bold mono - blocking ( l - jumper £ 28 , bag £ 28 , r - pyjama set £ 28 ) in a nod to @entity81 's @entity80 trend , classic shapes have been updated with tweed , textured knits , faux leather trimming , quilting and jacquard			1
and in another homage to high fashion the brand has used super chic model @entity90 , who bares a striking resemblance to it girl @entity94 , to showcase the collection			2
key looks for the new season are oversized knits or box tops worn with leather or print pencil skirts and the collection also serves up tweed coats , shift dresses and tunics			1
@entity5 have also taken note of the sports luxe trend , as championed by @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity94 , and introduced the style with silk - mix print bomber jackets and a quilted bomber teamed peg - leg trousers			0
comfort and style : there are plenty of cosy knits , black jeans and nude heels in the new collection , which starts at £ 10 ( jumper £ 25 , trousers £ 22 ) on trend : classic shapes have been updated with tweed , textured knits , faux leather trimming , quilting and jacquard ( l - tunic £ 35 , roll neck £ 10 , @entity134 - textured coat £ 65 , roll neck £ 10 , trousers £ 22 ) for outerwear , there are tweed and leather biker jackets , as well as khaki long jackets , which can be teamed with a roll neck and the boyfriend jean			1
as for footwear , the store have stuck to vintage - inspired styles with low block heel courts , @entity149 and kitten heels			1
but for those looking to add a tougher edge , there 's sturdy biker boots , jewel coloured suede shoe boots and brogues			0
@entity5 a / @entity26 is available in - store and online			0
familiar face : @entity5 's model , @entity90 ( left ) and her bushy eyebrows bear an uncanny resemblance to model - of - the - moment @entity94 ( right ) @entity5 began life in the 1970s and was acquired by sir @entity10 in 2002 and incorporated into the @entity9 in 2009			1
in early 2006 , @entity10 considered selling the store and contacted rivals including @entity165 and @entity166 with no success			1
in 2010 , @entity5 gave itself a brand overhaul by changing its logo , resurrecting the uppercase form of the abbreviation , launching an e-commerce website and a new store design			0
@entity5 has 179 stores nationwide and it has a rolling programme to modernise them ; about a quarter of the stores are now in the new formats			0
@entity5 has 18 dedicated home stores across the country			0
@entity183 offers over 30,000 products with on - line exclusives			0
@entity5 is expanding its international portfolio , currently at 90 stores			0
@entity188 set £ 28 it might have been given a glamorous new makeover but @entity5 has still kept its eye on the retail prize : the 30something professional woman with a bit of money to spend			2
like @entity195 , who has recently turned around its womenswear offering , the brand has listened to its customers and delivered wearable pieces that can be slotted in to an existing wardrobe ( complete with longer hemlines and sleeves ) rather than chasing the trends and trying to compete with ' younger ' brands like @entity3 or @entity206			1
interest comes in flashes of design detail rather than a too - short skirt or plunging neckline and while there is a nod to successful trends from the last few seasons ( pyjamas as outerwear , pictured right , were first seen in loud prints on the @entity220 catwalk ) the success of this collection lies in its simplicity : key pieces in easy - to - wear colours that will update a look without breaking the bank			2
favourite pieces include the @entity230 - style coat which i 'll be wearing with skinny leather trousers and the biker jacket worn with a 60s style polo neck .			2

@entity236 makes a *comeback* with fashionable new collection
' wearable and confident collection designed to suit every woman '
features vintage inspired shoes , lots of leather and tweed pencil skirts
