the discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages , when it is easiest to treat , and even stopping the disease in its tracks the telltale signs of @entity11 ’s can be seen in people as young as 20 , research shows			1
the ‘ unprecedented ’ finding suggests that the disease starts to eat away at the brain half a century before symptoms develop			1
this is a ‘ much younger age than the scientists ever imagined ’			0
the discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages , when it is easiest to treat , and even stopping the disease in its tracks			0
however , @entity24 experts cautioned that the research is still at an early stage			0
crucially , it is n’t known how many people who have the early signs of @entity11 ’s in their brains in their 20s will go on to develop the disease			1
@entity11 ’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 @entity24 and , worldwide , the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages			2
with no cure for dementia and existing drugs of limited use , the prime minister @entity37 has described dementia as ‘ the key health challenge of this generation ’			0
researchers , from @entity45 in @entity46 , examined the brains of elderly people with and without @entity11 ’s , as well as samples taken from 13 people aged between 20 and 66			1
these younger people were free of memory problems when they died			2
tests showed that beta - amyloid , the toxic protein that clogs up the brain in @entity11 ’s , had started building up in people as young as 20			1
it had been thought that the damage to the brain started just 15 or 20 years before the disease takes hold			1
lead researcher professor @entity63 said : ‘ discovering that amyloid begins to accumulate so early in life is unprecedented			0
’ the amyloid clumps were found inside neurons , or brain cells , that are involved in memory and attention and are among the first to die in normal ageing , as well as in @entity11 ’s			1
the professor said : ‘ this points to why those neurons die early			0
the lifelong accumulation of amyloid likely contributes to the vulnerability of these cells			0
‘ the growing clumps likely damage and eventually kill the neurons			2
’ scientists around the world are trying to make drugs that stop @entity11 ’s in its tracks			2
they believe the key to treatment will be to give the medicines as early as possible in the disease			0
but doctors called for more research to be carried out with not everyone who showed signs of @entity11 's developing the disease even delaying the onset of @entity11 ’s would have a massive impact on the lives of sufferers and their loved ones			1
the @entity98 gave the research , which is published in the journal brain a cautious welcome			0
dr @entity101 , the charity ’s head of research said the study was very small and that it is already known that not everyone with amyloid clumps will develop @entity11 ’s			1
he added : ‘ more research is needed to explain why only a proportion of people with a build - up of amyloid go on to develop alzheimer ’s disease			2
‘ there are clinical trials currently underway of drugs that reduce amyloid in the brain and we hope to find out if this is a successful way to prevent or delay alzheimer ’s disease in the next few years			0
’ dr @entity123 of @entity124 , said : ‘ with half a million people living with @entity11 ’s in the @entity24 and that number on the increase , we urgently need new treatments to stop the disease in its tracks			1
‘ a greater understanding of the early stages of @entity11 could provide new clues to help fight the disease , which is why investment in research is crucial			0

@entity138 means people can be treated years before showing symptoms
tests showed toxic protein which clogs brain started growing at age 20
as clumps of protein build up , cells surrounding the memory *weaken*
this explains why @entity11 's can advance so *quickly* , said experts
