one very good player moves out and another very good player moves in			0
@entity3 supporters have stopped fretting about departures because they have good reason to be confident in the people that run the club and their ability to find adequate replacements			1
in goal @entity11 became @entity13 , became @entity14 , who looks to have become @entity15			1
while centre - forward @entity18 became @entity19 , became @entity20 , became @entity21 who has now become that bloodied battering - ram @entity22			1
@entity3 know how to replace stars , from @entity13 ( left to right ) , to @entity14 , to @entity15 @entity19 ( left ) was a star at @entity3 before being replaced by @entity20 at the @entity26 club @entity21 ( left , squaring up to @entity27 ) was sold to @entity28 but replaced by @entity22 ( right ) @entity3 manager @entity29 has been pulling the strings at the @entity32 club in terms of transfers the secret of their success is often exactly that – a secret			1
no club has used the third - party ownership lenience in @entity41 more to its advantage than @entity3			1
transfers like @entity20 were always shrouded in mystery			0
how were they able to sell @entity19 to @entity46 and hand over a large portion of the fee to the tax man to service their monumental overdraft with the state , and yet still go into the transfer market and get @entity20 for an even higher price than @entity19 ? @entity55 has worked closely with the club and with its managing director @entity58 angel @entity59 across the last five years and there is no question the club have benefited from a healthy relationship with the world ’s most prolific agent			0
it was bordering on comical in 2010 when the @entity67 in @entity68 picked @entity59 as its sports director of the year			0
@entity55 played a large part in the setting up of the annual awards – he himself has won agent of the year every year since its inauguration			0
@entity3 playmaker @entity16 became @entity17 at the @entity78 under @entity29 @entity20 ( right ) , formerly of @entity3 , sits with super-agent @entity55 ( left ) during a match in @entity80 @entity3 's ceo @entity81 ( far right ) give a press conference in @entity3 in 2009 his domination of the best agent award was easier to justify than @entity59 ’s prize that year , coming as it did when @entity3 were still hugely indebted to @entity41 ’s @entity86 and forced to fire sell every summer			1
but @entity59 has led @entity3 out of trouble			2
he has picked his agent friends well , worked the loophole in the system – one @entity91 want to close allowing third party ownership in @entity41 when it is banned in other leagues - and that has played a part in the club 's rise			2
mendes it was who discovered @entity21 and brought him to @entity3 via @entity101			1
the super-agent can also claim to have been the man who saw the huge potential in the unrefined @entity106 front man , overruling scouts that he usually trusted without question and signing the youngster from @entity111 thus beginning the process of making him one of @entity114 ’s top striker			0
he was loaned him out to four @entity32 clubs but was always brought back to @entity3 who would eventually win the @entity118 , the @entity119 and the @entity120 with him as their centre - forward			1
@entity122 is @entity3 's brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on tuesday night @entity124 and @entity125 try to stop @entity126 during the @entity3 derby in the @entity120 as well as using the right agents to get the right players @entity3 have – like so many teams in @entity41 benefitted from an extensive and well - run youth system			1
@entity122 is their brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on tuesday against @entity135 with @entity124 and @entity125 who also both came through the ranks at @entity3 albeit only arriving at the first team after long spells away from the club			1
next season @entity141 should return from a hugely successful spell at @entity144 and line up alongside another off the conveyor build : the hugely impressive @entity147			0
it also should n’t be forgotten that with a very similar squad back in 2012 @entity3 were closer to the relegation places than the @entity152 places and even their most blinkered fan would have dismissed out of hand the idea that they would ever be winning the league and playing the @entity120 final in the same season any time soon			2
the reason for the change is perhaps their greatest signing of all – @entity29			0
he arrived at the start of 2012 just after they had been knocked out of @entity118 by a third division side			0
the likes of former @entity168 winger @entity167 were in the team back then too – he looked a symbol of the oh - so average signings being made by the club at the time			0
@entity29 has been up there with their greatest signings when they made him manager previously @entity167 was converted by @entity29 to full - back and is now in the form of his life at @entity3 @entity167 was converted by @entity29 to full - back and is now first choice on the right hand side of @entity41 ’s defence			2
his transformation is still a symbol , only now it is one of just how much the club and team have progressed			0
@entity194 company @entity193 now owns 20 per cent of @entity3 , their tax debt is under control and they are in a position to sign players without having to sell			2
having bought so well when they were in a worse financial situation , supporters are optimistic – just as long as they do n’t lose @entity29 : the real alchemist at @entity3 .			2

@entity3 0 - 0 @entity135 : click here for @entity204 's report
@entity3 have a knack for replacing star players with others just as good
@entity15 is the latest , having replaced *goalkeeper* @entity14
@entity22 looks to be a *suitable* replacement for @entity21
