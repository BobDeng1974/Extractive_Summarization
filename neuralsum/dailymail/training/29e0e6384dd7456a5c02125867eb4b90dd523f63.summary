@entity2 's @entity1 stars are set to be greeted with a playing surface not befitting the occasion when they face @entity5 in their @entity7 opener on saturday			1
pictures of the @entity9 , where @entity11 's side will face their @entity13 counterparts in just three days , emerged on wednesday			1
the pitch , in the heat of @entity15 , appeared to be in a poor condition with noticeable dry patches on the turf , particularly bare around one of the goals			2
the grass is n't greener : @entity2 will open their @entity1 campaign against @entity5 at the @entity9 patches : the pitch appeared dry in places and was noticeably bare , just three days ahead of the @entity7 match running out of time ! a lonely groundsman cuts the grass in the empty @entity9 stadium in @entity15 hoof and hope ? the uneven pitch surface is unlikley to promote passing football for @entity2 's opener it 's not the @entity38 ! weathered lines are clearly visible across the pitch in @entity15 @entity2 's stars have become accustomed to immaculate playing surfaces in the @entity38 , but now not only will they have to face the searing heat – with temperatures set to hit a tropical 30 degrees – but a questionable playing surface , too			1
construction work was also taking place at the venue with tarmac being laid only days before the @entity1 clash			0
meanwhile , @entity52 is a major injury doubt ahead of @entity2 's opener after limping out of training on tuesday			0
on track : @entity57 road builders work inside the stadium area of the @entity9 in @entity15 @entity2 vs @entity5 - @entity7 - june 14 @entity59 vs @entity61 - @entity60 - june 18 @entity62 vs @entity64 - @entity63 - june 22 @entity65 vs @entity67 - @entity66 - june 25 @entity52 pulled up midway through the 90 minute session based on team shape ahead of saturday 's clash with @entity72 's side			1
the @entity2 forward , who is a firm selection favourite with @entity2 head coach @entity11 , appears to have a hamstring strain			0
he left the training ground with blue tape on the inside of his thigh after undergoing treatment with @entity2 head physio @entity81			0
up for the battle : @entity83 and @entity84 will come face - to - face in saturday 's encounter warm weather : @entity88 is sprayed with water as the @entity2 defender bids to stay cool during training on your bike : @entity94 and @entity95 , who is set to miss the @entity5 match , observe training @entity11 also revealed that the players have started practising penalties and they were taken without a keeper during yesterday ’s session			1
@entity2 ’s players were asked to nominate a spot in the goal and had to shoot through hoops as part of the drill which is believed to have involved every squad member			0
@entity52 ’s chances of starting against @entity5 in @entity15 appear to rest on whether the @entity111 forward can train fully in the next two days			0
