by @entity0 scientists have made a ‘ giant leap forward ’ in the battle against deadly superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics			1
@entity7 researchers have decoded a key defence mechanism of some of the most hard - to - treat bacteria			1
the breakthrough paves the way for new drugs to treat those bugs which have become resistant to antibiotics – including a single pill that treats multiple illnesses			1
@entity7 researchers have decoded a key defence mechanism of some of the most hard - to - treat bacteria a spokesman for the researchers said : ‘ this is a giant leap forward in the fight against superbugs			1
‘ this discovery does n’t come a moment too soon			0
’ detailed in the prestigious journal nature , it follows stark warnings that the rise of antibiotic - resistant superbugs could drag the health service back to the 19th century			1
dame @entity31 , the chief medical officer , has described an ‘ apocalyptic scenario ’ in which , in just 20 years ’ time , routine operations such as hip replacements become deadly because relatively minor infections ca n’t be quashed			0
and the @entity37 has said that deaths from scratches and scrapes will soon become common because antibiotics are losing their power			0
dame @entity31 , the chief medical officer , has described an ' apocalyptic scenario ' the @entity45 research focuses on gram negative bacteria – a large family of bugs that includes @entity49 and @entity50 and many hospital superbugs			1
these bacteria have a thick outer layer that make them particularly hard to kill and are becoming more and more resistant to antibiotics			2
the researchers identified a way of disabling this defensive wall			2
without it bugs can not @entity60 researcher professor @entity59 , said : ‘ this is really important because drug - resistant bacteria is a global health problem			1
many current antibiotics are becoming useless , causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year			0
‘ the number of superbugs is increasing at an unexpected rate			2
this research provides the platform for urgently - needed new generation drugs			1
’ professor @entity74 , of the @entity75 , said : ‘ new antibiotics against gram negative bacteria including many hospital superbugs are notoriously difficult to develop and the problem is exacerbated as many of these bacteria are increasingly resistant to currently used antibiotics			1
’ he added that the research offers the possibility of creating a new drugs that disarm dangerous bacteria			0
the discovery was made using one of the world ’s most powerful x-ray machines			0
housed near @entity91 in @entity92 , the @entity90 uses beams of light 10 billion times more powerful than the sun to peer inside everything from medical molecules to historical documents			0
antibiotics are important medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria			0
bacteria can adapt and ﬁnd ways to survive the effects of an antibiotic			0
they become ‘ antibiotic resistant ’ , meaning that the antibiotic no longer works			2
the more often we use an antibiotic , the more likely it is that bacteria will become resistant to it			2
some bacteria that cause infections in hospitals , such as @entity116 , are resistant to several antibiotics .			0
