@entity12 , the information commissioner , said the deluge of unsolicited material was ‘ one of the great curses of the age ’ which he was increasingly powerless to stop			1
his warning follows a court case in which a judge ruled a company could not be fined hundreds of thousands of pounds despite bombarding phone users with millions of text messages over three years			1
companies which bombard the public with spam text messages , silent phone calls and junk emails could escape prosecution because of a legal ruling , the privacy watchdog warned last night @entity31 was originally fined £ 440,000 but won on appeal after a tribunal ruled the text messages were only a minor nuisance and did not cause ‘ substantial damage and distress ’			1
mr @entity12 said : ‘ we could show there was nuisance - that is n’t enough apparently ’ - as he called for the law to be changed			2
‘ we have just got to lower that hurdle because i think if you ask most people they would say silent calls and unsolicited spam texts are one of the great curses of the age - and if the information commissioner ca n’t protect you it ’s a poor lookout			1
’ experts suggest the ruling makes it hugely difficult , if not impossible for the @entity54 - the watchdog charged with protecting the public against the tidal wave of junk - to issue fines			0
the commissioner said the public were worried about the growth of the @entity63 care.data programme which was designed to harvest patients ¿ data on a huge database ministers have suggested they could pass a new law , and mr @entity12 is appealing the ruling - but until the legal position is clarified there are few deterrents for companies issuing spam messages			1
the fine was first handed down in november 2012 against two men , @entity77 and @entity78			0
@entity77 , who was hit with the bulk of the fine , appealed and won			0
an @entity54 probe found their firm was sending huge volumes of text messages from offices in @entity87 and @entity88 without phone users ’ consent and in breach of the law			1
the company made huge profits of around £ 8,000 a day from passing on personal details of anyone who responded to messages calling on them to make a legal claim following an accident or if they had been mis - sold @entity101			1
an @entity54 spokesman said the judgment was ‘ disappointing ’			0
he said : ‘ the public is clear that it wants to see a stop put to nuisance text messages			1
the fines we issue help to achieve that , and if we are prevented from issuing fines then it ’s fair to expect that the public will receive more of these messages			0
mr @entity12 said the public were much more concerned about privacy concerns than the stories about data collection by the security services gleaned from secret files stolen by @entity121 ( pictured ) ‘ this is another reminder of why we ’re pushing for a change in the law to make it easier for us to issue penalties			2
’ mr @entity12 also said the public were very concerned about the growth of the @entity63 care.data programme which was designed to harvest patients ’ data on a huge database			2
the project was put on hold for six months last week following privacy concerns			0
in an interview with the @entity138 mr @entity12 said the public were much more concerned about that issue than the stories about data collection by the security services gleaned from secret files stolen by @entity121			2
mr @entity12 said : ‘ people have been challenging me on the bus about care			2
that ’s the talking point but @entity121 has n’t been , which is kind of a surprise			0
’ he criticised the @entity63 ’s efforts to explain the care.data system - which included leaflets sent to households in @entity154 and not a personalised letter as he advised			0
‘ they said " no , we ’re going to do a leaflet			0
" i never received my leaflet , ' he said .			0
