@entity0 has scored against a @entity1 from @entity2 before			1
not the club boasting a single player worth almost £ 60million , however , but the one formed in 2005 by fans unhappy about the @entity7 family takeover			2
‘ a tap - in in front of 4,000 fans , ’ recalled 27 - year - old @entity0 on sunday night , fresh from vanquishing far greater adversaries with his searing pace and aggression			1
that 4 - 1 victory for @entity16 in the @entity17 came on @entity18 2011 , and the crowd ( 4,023 to be exact ) was the largest in the division ’s history — swollen because of the relative size of each club			1
@entity0 celebrates his goal against @entity1 which capped off a stellar display @entity0 took his goal with the look of an experienced @entity29 striker but has come a long way quickly @entity31 finished as champions that season , but @entity0 , then 24 , was out - scored in the strikers ’ chart by @entity36 of @entity37 ( 35 goals to 24 )			1
@entity39 is now at @entity40 , no small climb itself , but @entity0 ’s trajectory is on another gradient altogether			1
he was at @entity31 for only a year			2
before that , between 2003 and 2010 , he played for @entity46 on the eighth rung of the football ladder , having been released by @entity49 for being too small			1
‘ when i signed for @entity46 i was only 17 , getting kicked left , right , and centre by fully - grown blokes , ’ @entity0 remembered while clutching his man - of - the - match award			1
‘ that toughens you up			2
when it comes to games like this , they are always going to try get in your face — it does n’t faze me one bit			0
’ @entity0 was scoring in non-league football as recently as 2012 but has made incredible progress at @entity64 @entity64 striker @entity0 congratulates @entity65 after creating the @entity67 's first goal @entity0 won the penalty which got @entity64 back into the game , tumbling under the challenge of @entity71 in his early years at @entity72 , a town of 17,000 people in north @entity74 , @entity0 was under curfew and obliged to wear an electronic tag on his ankle after being charged with assault			1
he was struggling to cope with the anguish at seeing his golden opportunity in the game seemingly disappear			0
‘ when i was released by wednesday i thought that was it , ’ said @entity0 in an interview last year			1
‘ there were some hard times			0
it was n’t nice wearing the tag and it ’s not good having to be in your house at 6pm every night			0
‘ i was sticking up for a mate who was deaf and somebody was taking the p * * * out of him for wearing a hearing aid			0
they got thrown out of the pub but they were waiting for us an hour and half later			0
‘ they started attacking him and i was n’t going to stand there and let him take a beating			0
i learned from that and from that stage things started looking up			0
’ during his time at @entity72 , where the ground holds 3,500 people , @entity64 manager @entity107 , who lives in the @entity74 area , would watch him play as he plundered 66 goals in 107 league games			2
@entity0 is extremely popular with both his teammates and the @entity64 fans and is rewarding their faith @entity0 was a constant handful , sometimes literally as @entity118 shows , for the @entity1 defence ‘ we ’ve known about him since then , ’ said @entity107 in march			1
‘ a long , long time			0
’ @entity0 went from @entity31 to @entity122 side @entity121 in 2011 and 31 goals in 36 league games later , @entity107 finally made his move			1
@entity64 paid £ 1m for his signature , a record for a @entity129 player , in may 2012			1
‘ it was probably more than we ’d have liked to have paid , ’ admitted @entity107 , ‘ but it was needed when there were four or five other @entity133 sides who wanted to sign him all of a sudden			0
’ another signpost in @entity0 ’s remarkable story is that he scored twice in the @entity122 against @entity137 as recently as april 2012			1
in his first season at @entity139 struggled severely to adjust and has said he almost quit as a result of heavy criticism			2
but last season he came back fitter and was a major reason behind the @entity143 ’ march to the @entity133 title , scoring 16 goals			0
@entity0 has come a long way from playing non-league football in 2012 to sinking @entity1 on sunday @entity0 is brought down by @entity149 , leaving to the @entity1 defender 's red card and @entity64 's fifth goal he is an immensely popular member of the dressing room , earning the nickname @entity156 more for his explosive sense of humour than powerful shooting , it appears			1
‘ i ’m a bit of a nut - job in the changing room , ’ laughed @entity0 last night having out - performed @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			2
‘ we ’ve all had different routes			0
@entity168 was a bit worse but i ’ve managed to make my way up that pyramid			0
i could n’t tell you what league i started at			0
’ @entity0 paid tribute to his manager for having faith			2
‘ it was a massive gamble but hopefully now i ’m repaying him			0

@entity0 scored one and made four as @entity64 beat @entity1
four years *ago* @entity0 was playing for @entity16 against @entity182 in front of 4,000 fans
@entity0 was released by @entity49 for being too small aged 17
forward became most *expensive* signing from non-league football when he *joined* @entity64 for £ 1m in 2012
in april 2012 @entity139 scored his last @entity129 goal - two years on and he helps @entity64 beat @entity1 5 - 3
