professor @entity0 , of @entity1 , has joined the campaign to oppose a housing development in a @entity5 hamlet where @entity6 was inspired to pen his famous works the fight to save a village where @entity6 was inspired to write some of his most famous works has stretched across the world , to @entity11			1
@entity1 has now joined the campaign to protect the village of @entity14 in @entity5 after campaigners , including @entity17 creator @entity16 , said it would be ' obliterated ' if a new housing development were to go ahead			1
an application by an agricultural college to build 70 homes at the tiny village where @entity6 went to school has been fiercely opposed by fans of the writer who said the extra houses would triple the size of the hamlet and ruin its tranquil setting			1
now 3,000 miles away , professor @entity0 , has launched an official objection to the development			2
@entity6 went to school in @entity14 , near @entity34 , and penned @entity35 at his parents ' cottage nearby			1
the village , which has just 28 houses , also provided the inspiration for two of his greatest works ; ' under the @entity43 ' and ' @entity44			2
' as well as @entity50 and @entity1 , @entity51 , @entity52 , the @entity53 , the @entity49 the @entity45 and a member of the public called @entity48 are fighting the plans			1
prof @entity0 , who has taught at @entity1 for 20 years and is the president of the @entity56 , said : ' the size , scale and intrusive nature of the proposed development would adversely affect the serene , rustic character of the high value landscape			1
' such heritage assets once destroyed would be destroyed forever			0
' the setting of the hamlet , to which thousands of visitors are drawn every year - many in homage to @entity6 's country - would cease to be a global attraction ; indeed its loss would be mourned by millions			2
' @entity6 was born in @entity14 in 1840 and grew up in his parents ' thatched cottage			1
he walked a mile every day to go to school at @entity14 , which the author called @entity75 , and has just 28 properties			2
in ' under the @entity43 ' , the new school mistress , @entity78 , arrives in ' @entity75 ' and attracts a number of suiters to the school house where she lives , including the local vicar			0
the old school house is now a private residence but the original bell that would have signaled to @entity6 the start of the school day remains in the porch			2
@entity6 walked to @entity14 in @entity5 every day , taking inspiration to write @entity44 @entity14 is also the place where @entity6 first encountered an 18 - year - old milkmaid who he based the main character in ' @entity44 ' on			1
@entity17 creator @entity16 lives in the neighbouring village of @entity95 and is president of the @entity6 society			1
he said the development would be like an ' atomic bomb ' for residents and the countryside and rolling hills needed to be preserved as they were key to @entity6 's inspiration			2
he said : ' following the examples of @entity105 or @entity106 where students of the @entity108 or @entity109 may still see and understand the places that inspired their work			0
@entity16 , pictured on a bridge in the hamlet , said he believes it will be obliterated by the development @entity6 was inspired by the sights , buildings and people he saw in @entity14 to pen his novels campaigners have opposed the planning application since it was submitted by an agricultural college ' the truth is that @entity5 , unlike most counties , boasts a writer of global significance in @entity6 and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve the environment that gave birth to his works for students all over the planet to come and see for themselves			1
' he added : ' it would be quite impossible to drop seventy houses on to this little community without destroying it utterly			0
' @entity141 agricultural college , which owns two parcels of land either side of @entity14 , submitted the planning application			1
it said developing the land is the only way they can raise funds to expand and develop			0
the plans involve building 70 properties on land between @entity14 and @entity14 @entity141 agricultural college said it needs to build the properties so it can expand and develop principal @entity154 said : ' we want to provide additional @entity157 agri - tech facilities and expand our higher education offer enabling more students to study degree programmes on their doorstep			1
' the capital released from the sale of land will enable the college to embark on a programme of redevelopment and will have a positive impact on meeting local housing needs			0
' the plans to change the use of the two sites and build the 70 homes will be considered by @entity174 in the near future			1
born in 1840 , @entity6 is now one of the most celebrated novelists and poets in @entity179 history - not least because of his descriptions of rural @entity5 life			1
he immortalised the county where he grew up as ' @entity183 ' , setting all of his major novels in the somewhat idealised , fictionalised world			0
to him as to many romantic and @entity188 authors , the countryside represented a more pristine life than the grunting machinery which heralded the @entity191 , but also one more closely entwined with mankind 's animalistic desires			0
celebrated : @entity6 created a pastoral picture of the rural @entity179 in which he grew up @entity183 was first used in @entity35 , which told the story of an independent - minded young woman who refuses to marry humble shepherd @entity35			1
the girl , @entity35 , comes into money and moves away - but is forced to seek @entity203 's help when her sheep begin dying			0
a long and complex friendship follows , and slowly @entity206 realises the friendship of her youth - not the temptations of the wider world - is the key to her happiness			0
@entity203 asks her to marry him a second time and she accepts			0
@entity183 was also used in @entity6 's 1892 masterwork @entity44 - whose original subtitle was a @entity216			2
she is the daughter of a poor family which is corrupted at the beginning of the novel by a rumour that she is descended from nobility			0
but when she goes to meet the libertine @entity224 , instead of inheriting his family 's estate she starts working on it - before being raped by @entity224 in a symbolic , and real , loss of innocence			0
as her life unravels it does so in that same country setting , and after she finally stabs @entity224 to death it is to @entity234 that she walks to await her fate			0
@entity183 itself was named after the @entity238 @entity179 kingdom which took in much of the south west , but its borders were not the same and changed from novel to novel			2
in reality it was a poor area which changed little in hundreds of years and was blighted by a devastating death rate in sickness and childbirth ' @entity6 turned away from novels in the 1890s after @entity44 and @entity250 received mixed reviews , and began writing poetry instead			0
he died in 1928 and his ashes were interred in @entity254 at @entity255 .			0
