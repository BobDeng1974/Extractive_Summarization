an @entity1 tv channel has been fined £ 85,000 after it broadcast a hate preacher to instructing muslims to kill those who insult @entity4 live on live television			1
broadcasting watchdog @entity6 reprimanded @entity7 , which runs the @entity1 channel @entity8 for allowing its presenter to tell viewers it was their duty to murder non-muslims during a phone in show			1
the channel broadcasts both in the @entity17 and internationally mostly in @entity18 but also @entity19 and @entity20 and is aimed at young @entity17 muslims			2
offensive : allama @entity22 told viewers that it was their ' mission ' to ' protect the sanctity of our beloved lord ' the offending show was broadcast on may 3 last year and featured the presenter @entity29 taking phone - in from audience members around the world			1
mr @entity29 answered questions about a wide range of issues and personal conduct relating to @entity1 and @entity1 teachings			0
but following a question from a @entity41 caller asking what the ' punishment ' should be for those who disrespect the @entity4 , his answer was that they ' should be eliminated			1
' speaking directly into the camera mr @entity47 said : ' one has to choose one ’s own method			0
' our way is the peaceful way but when someone crosses the limits , faith - based emotions are instigated ... the mission of our life is to protect the sanctity of our beloved lord			2
' may @entity58 accept us wherever there is a need [ to kill a blasphemer ]			0
we are ready and should be ready at all times [ to kill a blasphemer ] ' the regulator judged that these comments were ' likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or to lead to disorder			2
' it also said it was concerned that young people watching the show could become ' radicalised ' or take ' violent and criminal action as a result of watching videos of @entity1 with extreme views			0
' it considered the remarks to be so inflammatory they could have inspired a repeat of the murder of @entity82 filmmaker @entity81 , who was killed after @entity1 clerics condemned his film which criticised the treatment of @entity1 women			0
the regulator said is was concerned that young @entity1 watching the extremist views might become radicalised in its ruling , @entity6 criticised @entity90 based - @entity7 for not taking the comments seriously enough after concerns were initially raised by the broadcast watchdog			1
@entity8 has however remained defiant and has not broadcast an apology for the comments , instead opting to broadcast a ' clarification ' six months later			1
@entity6 said : ' @entity96 [ @entity97 ] has not at any point broadcast any form of apology for , or condemnation of mr @entity29 ’s remarks , and neither on air nor in correspondence with @entity6 has the @entity96 expressed its unequivocal regret that these comments were broadcast			1
' @entity96 regretted only in its submissions that the presenter ’s comments " may have been misinterpreted " and that he expressed his own political views during the programme			0
' taking all these factors into account , @entity6 was concerned that the @entity96 has still not recognised the gravity of the statements made by mr @entity29			0
' but despite this the regulator decided only to give @entity7 a third of the full £ 250,000 fine which it could have enforced because it said it wished to protect the station 's right to ' freedom of expression			1
' in it 's judgement it added : ' if any financial penalty was to be so high that its effect would be to close a service down , then it might be a disproportionate interference with the @entity96 ’s and the audience ’s right to freedom of expression in particular and exceed the purposes of imposing a penalty			2
' @entity6 therefore carefully took this point into account and carefully weighed it in reaching its decision on the proportionality of the financial penalty			0
' the fine announced today , comes three years after @entity97 was fined £ 75,000 for appealing for viewers to donate money in return for ' prayers or the receipt of a “ special gift ” of earth from the tomb of @entity4			1
' @entity146 were not available for comment on the matter			0
last december @entity149 , in @entity150 , was fined £ 4,000 for breaching broadcasting rules in programmes involving a presenter called ‘ @entity154 ’			1
she told listeners homosexuals should be beaten and tortured , adding : ‘ torture them ; punish them ; beat them and give them mental torture			2
’ @entity163 , based in @entity164 , has been found in breach of the code twice in 18 months for programmes which denigrated a minority muslim sect .			0

allama @entity22 told viewers live on - air that those who caused offence to the @entity4 ' should be eliminated '
the channel could have been fined up to £ 250,000 but regulator opted to protect their ' freedom of expression '
broadcaster remains *unrepentant* and have since broadcast a ' clarification ' instead of an apology
