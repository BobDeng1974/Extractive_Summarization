the investigation comes as agriculture minister @entity47 questioned the ethics of @entity12 investigators who obtained footage			1
mr @entity47 told the @entity51 : ' one of the questions i ask is with the up close shot of the man hitting the sheep , which is obviously exceptional and cruel and in many instances would be immediate dismissal , where exactly was the camera ? ' did the person know that they were filmed ? were they actually part of process ? there are lots of questions that need to be asked			1
' but @entity12 hit back at mr @entity47 's comments , explaining that some of the shearers committing the abuse knew that they were being filmed			1
@entity75 , from @entity76 , told @entity31 on friday : ' some of the footage was filmed openly and many of the shearers were aware they were being filmed			1

' @entity119 senator @entity118 has also slammed mr @entity47 's comments and called for a police investigation into the footage			1
' mr @entity47 as the agriculture minister does n't do justice to the farming communities who share concerns of cruelty to animals , ' she told @entity31			1

this includes good wool handling and shearing practices			0
' shocking footage was released in 2011 by @entity159 showing the sever mistreatment of animals being exported to @entity162 following its release live exports were banned for nearly a month by the @entity167 government @entity170 ( @entity169 ) president @entity168 said the actions of shearers in the video was ' unacceptable and unsupportable ' , according to @entity174			2
mr @entity168 added the footage showed isolated incidents by a few shearers			0
' we ’re sure it does n’t portray the 99.9 per cent majority of wool shearers and those shearers would be appalled by it as well , ' he said			0
' woolgrowers condemn this treatment of animals ; we ’re not in the business of treating animals like that and nor are shearers			0

' the allegations are serious and will be investigated by @entity195 as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation , ' a spokeswoman said			2

' ' we do not condone or support the actions of anyone that results in the abuse of sheep either intentionally or unintentionally , ' @entity210 told the website			0
' rough handling of animals that might result in the injury of a sheep is an unacceptable maneuver during the shearing process or anytime when sheep are handled			2

this prompted a national and international outcry , and live exports to @entity162 were suspended for just under a month , from june 7 to july 6 2011			0
following this , the @entity167 government were forced to put in place stronger safeguards to ensure the well being of all animals leaving @entity18 , but animal rights groups argue the situation has not improved			1
following the more recent footage released on thursday , the @entity12 investigators claim farmers put tight rings on some lambs ' scrotums with anaesthetics to castrate them , but when that failed shearers would just cut off their testicles with shears			1
the animals were also deprived of food and water before being sheared so they were too weak to fight , they claim			0

' i think it ’s extremely shocking			0
sheep are very gentle animals			0
they show fear if they ’re on their own			0
' it ’s devastating and no compassionate person could watch that footage and not be horrified			0

mr @entity168 said $ 2.8 million had been spent by @entity169 in the last year to train shearers to prevent injury or cruelty			0
' there will be a fair bit of attention focused on the industry now and we ’re disappointed because we ’ve come a long way in the last 10 years with animal welfare standards and we ’re continuing to put a lot of resources into that area of our business ; it ’s a high priority , ' he said			0
he added that @entity169 would never make @entity12 happy because the activists wanted them to stop farming all together			0
