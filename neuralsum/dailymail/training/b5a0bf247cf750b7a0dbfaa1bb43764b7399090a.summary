by @entity1 reporter published : 20:04 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 04:18 est , 28 may 2013 women could evolve out of having the menopause so that they can have children at a later age , according to scientists			1
with improved medical treatments for an ageing population , experts say there is no need for the menopause , which only serves to stop older and younger generations competing			1
scientist and writer @entity13 explained that no other animal underwent the process whereby a woman stops ovulating , which in turn making her infertile			1
scientists say that in the future women well into their 50s could mother children			0
they believe that women will either evolve out of the menopause or targeted gene therapies will be developed to treat the condition she said that the process was abnormal , that there was ' no benefit ' to the condition and that women should not have to go through it			1
the @entity34 reported that older women are becoming increasingly healthy and could be able to have children in their 50s			2
if experts are correct , pregnancy will one day not only be the preserve of the young speaking at the @entity40 , biologist @entity41 , said that the menopause is something that could be ' overcome ' as we evolve			2
she explained that scientists are investigating early menopause and looking for a specific gene that causes the condition			1
this could eventually lead to gene therapy for all women			0
she said : ' the mood of scientists working on this and looking into the future is we will either technologically or scientifically evolve out of the menopause			0
' it is a health risk and it is a real and inescapable block on reproduction for one half of us - the women , but not the men			0
' the researcher in cancer genetics at @entity65 argued that ovarian failure should be treated like any other organ failure			0
she pointed out that women were at an increased risk of certain conditions such as osteoporosis and breast cancer after the menopause .			0

scientists and writer @entity13 spoke at the @entity40
' grandmother *hypothesis* ' says menopause developed so that older women could look after their child *'s* babies and it stopped generations competing
@entity13 said we may evolve out of menopause but that scientists are also trying to *pinpoint* specific gene to create therapy to treat condition
