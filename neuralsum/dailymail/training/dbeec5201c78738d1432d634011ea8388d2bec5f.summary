@entity0 said he had paid cash for work but not so the trader could avoid tax @entity0 today waded into the row over cash - in - hand work - insisting it was okay not to ask for a receipt because the ' onus ' was not on tragers to pay their tax			1
a spokeswoman for the prime minister said he had occasionally paid for goods and services in cash without getting a receipt , but insists that he has never helped someone ' evade the taxes that they should pay '			1
she added : ' if you have one - off payments for something , you may well pay cash			2
the onus is on the trader , who is responsible for making sure they pay the taxes that they owe			0
' mr @entity0 's intervention came after @entity31 's shadow business secretary @entity30 said getting a receipt for all cash - in - hand jobs was a ' matter of good housekeeping ' and was a ' good thing to do '			1
mr @entity30 's remarks were in response to the controversy sparked by @entity31 's shadow chancellor @entity40 who said families had a duty document how much they pay every time they get their hedge trimmed			1
mr @entity40 said people had a duty to demand receipts for the smallest cash jobs carried out by gardeners , cleaners and handymen			1
but mr @entity30 this morning defended the shadow chancellor			2
he said : ' is he demanding that your viewers keep every single receipt they get ? ... no , he was n't			1
' however , he added : ' as a matter of good housekeeping it 's a good thing to do ' the @entity60 this morning claimed mr @entity40 's suggestion revealed a ' complete lack of understanding ' about business			1
work and pensions secretary @entity65 said it was ' absurd '			0
he said : ' i do n't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process ; in other words , if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business , then of course i suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record , that 's the right thing to do			2
' but if you have a one - off payment for something and you pay cash , i should n't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is @entity31 's complete lack of understanding about how business works and , actually , how people get by			1
' @entity31 's shadow business secretary @entity30 said it was ' a matter of good housekeeping ' to get a receipt for cash - in - hand jobs , following @entity40 's remarks shadow @entity30 refused five times to say whether @entity31 would hand back any money received from a donor found to have used aggressive tax avoidance			1
he was quizzed on the subject on the today programme yesterday by @entity113			0
mr @entity113 : can we take it as an absolute given that if you discover that anyone who 's given money to the @entity31 has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance , you give the money back ? mr @entity30 : i think the @entity31 would think twice about accepting money from people who fit the description that you give			1
mr @entity113 : no , simple question : if you 've taken it , from somebody who is discovered to have been involved in aggressive tax avoidance , will you give the money back ? mr @entity30 : well i 'm not aware that we have taken money from anybody who 's engaged			2
mr @entity113 : no , but if it emerged , nor am i , but if it emerged , are you going to be as good as your word ? if it emerged , would you give that money back ? mr @entity30 : well as i said , i think the @entity31 found out that somebody was engaged in aggressive tax avoidance , would think twice before taking the money			1
mr @entity113 : but if you had taken the money you 'd give it back ? mr @entity30 : well i 'm not , i mean , you 're asking me a hypothetical question , because i 'm not aware that we have taken it			2
mr @entity113 : well most questions in the run up to an election are hypothetical			0
you 're talking about hypothetical questions about what you would do with business if you became a government			0
you are n't a government			0
therefore that 's hypothetical , this is hypothetical			0
if the money came from a tax dodger , would you give it back ? mr @entity30 : well i 'm not aware that it has , that we have received any monies from people engaging in aggressive tax avoidance			2
he told @entity162 : ' here we have a man that would be the chancellor who is wandering around saying @entity166 is going to watch you carefully , that if you do any cash transactions and do n't keep receipts , somehow they are going to punish you			0
' the shadow chancellor 's comments came as @entity31 and the @entity60 engaged in furious clashes over tax dodging , with both sides complaining of smears			2
as he was pressed on @entity180 's @entity179 's politics about what constituted tax avoidance , mr @entity40 said : ' the right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them			1
' asked whether he himself followed that rule , he said : ' absolutely			0
that 's because i am the shadow chancellor and i 'm extremely careful about these things			0
' over my life , have i ever given people a tenner and not given a receipt for it ? probably yes			0
but he had not done so ' since i have been involved in politics and @entity208 matters '			0
mr @entity40 said : ' it 's not your job to pay their taxes for them and i think most people you give a tenner to are not going to be vat - registered			1
' they 've got the legal obligation to make sure they pay their taxes if it 's that kind of transaction - but i think the sensible thing for anybody is that you 've got a record of it and you 've done it properly			1
' mr @entity65 said he could ' understand the frustrations people feel ' about tax avoidance but insisted the government had acted to close loopholes			0
mr @entity30 this morning dismissed the row as ' a storm in a teacup '			1
he told @entity233 : ' i sometimes think the whole way we do politics and debate things in this bubble is just so ridiculous			0
' he was doomed if he did and doomed if he did n't , in answering that question			0
it 's all over the papers this morning , and actually it 's a bit of a storm in a teacup , in my view			0
' mr @entity30 acknowledged that he did not keep all his own receipts , suggesting that mr @entity40 was in a special position as he was putting himself forward as a future chancellor who might one day be in charge of @entity249			1
' for my own part , do i keep a receipt every time i pay for something ? i just paid for something using contactless payment , i did n't get a receipt for that , ' mr @entity30 told @entity233 .			2
