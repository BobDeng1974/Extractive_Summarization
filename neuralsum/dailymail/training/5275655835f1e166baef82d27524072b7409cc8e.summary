by @entity0 published : 17:31 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 18 april 2013 strictly speaking , their names were n’t on the guest list			1
there were no celebrated faces among them , and certainly no dignitaries or royalty			1
but yesterday , in a swathe that stretched nearly three miles through @entity11 , the ordinary people of @entity9 turned out in their tens of thousands for @entity12			1
there were dissenters , of course , but this was one day when the jeers were massively overwhelmed by the cheers			1
’ three decades ago it might have been unimaginable that so many might turn out to pay their respects to the woman once dubbed a schoolchildren ’s ‘ milk snatcher ’ , a prime minister who stubbornly stuck to her principles in defiance of what others thought was right			1
yet this was n’t a funeral to mirror the one afforded to @entity63 in thanks for uniting the people ; more an indication , perhaps , that hindsight had allowed so many to realise how much 11 years of @entity68 might ultimately have shaped their lives for the better			1
from the heart of the @entity73 , but without @entity74 to signal 10am , up along @entity75 to @entity76 , it was thick with hundreds , later thousands of men , women and children , prepared to witness even the briefest of moments in history as the cortege passed beneath @entity86 ’s watchful eye			1
love : a man proudly waves a homemade banner on the three - mile route of the funeral procession which was eight deep in places thank you : a @entity95 worker shows his appreciation to @entity12 one middle - aged woman held up a placard			1
‘ thank you @entity12 ’ was all it said			1
indeed , by 10am there was hardly a square foot remaining on which to stand , nor a single piece of street furniture to climb on			2
they were seven to ten deep in places and shoulder to shoulder as far as you could see			2
others opted for a view from the top of office blocks			2
fan : a boy flies the @entity33 flag at the funeral of @entity12 yesterday expensive city suits stood alongside mothers with pushchairs ; pensioners beside children and grandchildren who should probably have been at school			1
‘ here she comes ! ’ someone shouted , and all eyes turned westward			2
by the time the cortege came into view the crowds were so tightly packed it was a struggle to catch even a glimpse of the procession , save for horses ’ hooves and the too many pairs of highly polished military boots to count			2
from somewhere behind the throng , an arm raised up to throw a white rose towards the coffin			2
one group of veteran paratroopers who fought in the @entity48 stood to attention and saluted			1
former lance corporal @entity144 , 51 , recalled those who lost their lives in 1982 and told me : ‘ she put the great back in @entity46 at a time when it was desperately needed			2
’ beside him captain @entity152 , 63 , said of the protesters : ‘ they have a right to protest			0
that ’s democracy … and that was the reason we went to war when the islands were taken over by a fascist regime			0
‘ if it was n’t for @entity12 , they ’d all be living under a different government now			0
’ an effigy of @entity12 in a noose was paraded through the streets and set ablaze in a former mining village where there were beers rather than tears yesterday			0
ex-miners , led by @entity174 ’s former wife @entity173 , cheered as they staged the ‘ alternative ’ mock cremation in @entity176 , near @entity177			0
villagers also let off fireworks in a deliberate snub to the dignified pageantry of the funeral service in @entity183			0
an effigy of former @entity22 prime minister @entity12 hangs from a roof as people gather to celebrate her death in @entity176 , @entity188 protestors turn their backs as the coffin makes its way past the @entity193 in the @entity194 protest : a woman burns a mock coffin of @entity12 in the @entity198 area of @entity199 , @entity200 mrs @entity174 , 71 , said : ‘ we ’ve waited a long time for this day here , and as you can see there ’s a party atmosphere			1
‘ @entity12 – that woman – she decimated our communities			0
she starved our kids , there ’s no jobs			0
she will never be forgiven			0
’ in @entity11 , outside @entity183 ’s , a minor scuffle involving 20 protesters broke out after mourners told them to ‘ go away and have some respect ’			0
much of the anger was directed at former @entity217 prime minister @entity216 with anti-war activists shouting ‘ shame on you ’ , as he arrived with wife @entity219			0
@entity223 chiefs were delighted that their multi-million - pound security operation passed without a single arrest			0
anti-thatcher protesters hold placards during a demonstration against @entity12 in @entity229 in @entity230 @entity232 @entity231 celebrate by burning a mock coffin of @entity12 in the @entity198 area of @entity199 in @entity200 people from all generations came together to protest against @entity12 in @entity230 revellers partying at the death of former @entity12 by dancing with a makeshift coffin at @entity229 in @entity230 march : protesters at @entity241 , @entity230 on the day of @entity12 's funeral placards : hundreds gathered in @entity230 to celebrate the death of @entity12			0

in a quite remarkable tribute supporters threw flowers and applauded
expensive city suits stood alongside mothers with pushchairs
despite the support there were also dissenters across the @entity22
