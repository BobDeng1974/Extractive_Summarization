@entity0 pointedly refused to call @entity2 terrorists @entity1 today as he spoke at a joint press conference with @entity5 prime minister @entity4			1
standing just a few feet away , @entity4 warned of a global ' @entity8 extremist terrorist threat , ' condemning the perversion of @entity10 in the strongest possible terms three times and using the word ' poisonous ' to describe the radicalized ideology five times			1
keeping with his administration 's policy to label foreign fighters as ' terrorists , ' @entity0 would not refer to the religion of @entity2 militants during the @entity22 news conference but at one point called them ' fanatics			1
' @entity0 said the world must ' lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the @entity29 ' and push a counter narrative as ' aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming ' from the radicals			1
@entity4 repeatedly referred to radicalized @entity10 as a ' poisonous ' ideology but @entity0 would n't imply religion was a motivating factor of terrorists ' this phenomenon has violent roots , the ideology , the networks , ' @entity0 said of @entity2			1
' this has metastasized and it is widespread and it has penetrated communities around the world ' their @entity37 , news conference came after a working dinner on thursday evening and a meeting in the @entity55 this morning			0
the @entity34 president said in his opening remarks that the coalition against @entity2 is ' systematically taking out their fighters , ' and he looked forward to hosting @entity60 at terror summit in february			2
in his own statement @entity4 told reporters , ' we face a poisonous and fanatical ideology that wants to pervert @entity10			1
' ' we do face a very serious @entity8 extremist terrorist threat in @entity68 , in @entity34 , across the world			0
and we have to be incredibly vigilant in terms of that threat , ' he later said			0
@entity4 said the world must focus on breaking down the ' poisonous radical death cult of a narrative ' that 's corrupting the @entity10 religion			1
that is ' the heart of the matter ' he said			0
it must also avoid creating ' safe havens for terrorists to otherwise talk to each other			0
' @entity0 said the @entity34 and his allies were working to identify terrorist actors in @entity86 and deactivate them			1
' this phenomenon has violent roots , the ideology , the networks , ' he said			0
' this has metastasized and it is widespread and it has penetrated communities around the world			0
' the @entity34 president said he does not consider the threat from @entity2 an ' existential ' one , and like @entity4 , he believe is one ' that we will solve			2
' ' we are stronger			0
we are representing values that the vast majority of @entity1 believe in , in tolerance , and in working together to build rather than destroy , and so this is a problem that causes great heartache and tragedy and destruction , ' he said			1
' but it is one that ultimately we 're going to defeat			0
' @entity0 said that weapons alone would do the job , and that he and @entity4 discussed during their meeting how to ' lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the @entity1 world so that this counter narrative against this nihilism is put out there as aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming out from these fanatics			1
' ' how do we make sure that we are working with local communities and faith leaders , and families ' whether in @entity60 or the @entity34 , he said , ' so that we 're inoculating ourselves against this kind of ideology			0
' that 's gon na be slow , plotting , systematic work , ' @entity0 noted , but it 's work he 's ' confident ' the @entity34 can achieve it , ' especially with partners like the @entity5			1
' @entity0 also suggested that the @entity34 had an ' advantage ' over countries like @entity60 when it comes to fighting terrorism because ' our @entity1 populations , they feel themselves to be @entity34			2
' ' there is this incredible process of immigration and assimilation that is part of our tradition			0
that is probably our greatest strength , ' he said			0
@entity4 and @entity0 were just coming off of a meeting a working dinner on thursday evening followed by an @entity55 meeting this morning @entity0 said that during their meeting , he talked with @entity4 about his views that the world must ' lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the @entity29 ' and push a counter narrative as ' aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming ' from the radicals the @entity22 has actively refused to describe @entity10 radicals fighting in @entity159 and @entity86 for a caliphate in religious terms			1
' let ’s call them what they are , ' @entity0 's spokesman said on tuesday			1
' these terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion			1
' but based on the fact that the religious leaders of that religion have roundly condemned their actions , those religious leaders have indicated that their actions are entirely inconsistent with @entity10 , ' he said			2
@entity176 said the fact that the ' majority of victims of terror attacks ' are @entity1 ' is a pretty clear indication that this is not a matter of the world being at war with @entity10			2
' ' the world and the @entity34 ... is at war with these individuals , these violent extremists who carry out these acts of terror and try to justify it by invoking this religion			2
the @entity34 official admitted that unlike other @entity195 leaders , including @entity197 president @entity196 , @entity0 's administration was purposefully avoiding use of the term ' radical @entity10			1
' one reason , he said , is that , he ' would n’t want to be in a position where i ’m repeating the justification that they have cited that i think is completely illegitimate			0
' ' these are individuals who are terrorists , '' ] he again said			2
' and what they did was they tried to invoke their own distorted deviant view of @entity10 to try to justify them			2
' and i think that is completely illegitimate			0
and what we should do is we should call it what it is			0
and it ’s an act of terror , and it ’s one that we roundly condemn			0
