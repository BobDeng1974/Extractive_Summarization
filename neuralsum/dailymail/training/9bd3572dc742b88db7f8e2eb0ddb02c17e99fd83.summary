@entity0 will welcome back a number of familiar faces when @entity3 arrive next weekend for a match @entity5 believes could prove vital in the top - four race			1
during last summer 's unparalleled talent drain , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 all left @entity11 's in favour of a move to @entity14			1
those exits came at a reported combined cost of Â£ 49million and compounded the departures of head coach @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			0
@entity5 is confident @entity0 can beat top - four rivals @entity3 at @entity11 's a week on sunday the @entity23 full back helped @entity0 keep their 12th clean sheet of the season against @entity26 saints , though , have confounded those expecting them to struggle , with @entity31 's men sitting fourth in the @entity33 standings with 13 matches remaining			1

@entity31 's side have not won in four successive home matches in all competitions , with the 10 men of @entity26 the latest to leave with a smile on their face			2
@entity5 believes @entity0 have found it difficult to break teams down at home because teams defend deep ' i think teams are coming up against us and making it really difficult for us to play , ' @entity5 said after wednesday 's goalless draw			1
' i think they are coming to play counter-attacking football , which means that we have to try and break them down			0
' yeah , it makes it difficult but we 're up for the challenge			0
' @entity0 have certainly proved up to the challenge defensively , with their record of 12 clean sheets and just 17 goals conceded the best in the @entity33			2
the right back makes an acrobatic attempt to clear the ball during the draw with @entity0 ' i think we 've been solid all season , really , ' @entity5 added			1
