with her toothy grin , large brown eyes and friendly expression , this preening female looks like a natural in front of the camera			2
but it seems when the crested black macaque pushed the camera button and took her first ever ‘ selfie ’ - a picture which would be viewed millions of times on the internet - she may have been frightened			1
‘ that ’s not a big smile , ’ explains award - winning @entity17 wildlife photographer @entity16 , whose camera the macaque commandeered to take her picture			1
it may signal that she is not sure what to do			0
’ the picture was snapped when @entity16 , 49 , followed a troupe of around 20 primates on an expedition in the tropical forests on the @entity46 island of @entity47			1
yet it has now become the subject of a copyright battle , with @entity16 threatening to sue a website that is allowing the image to be downloaded for free - claiming it is the work of the animal , not @entity16			1
the pictures were taken in 2011 , when @entity16 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , rose at dawn every day to try to capture the macaques in their local habitat			1
but it turned out to be a case of monkey - see , monkey - do , as the primates , which boast blazing reddish eyes and spiky hairdos , quickly took @entity16 ’s job in hand			1
at the end of the second day , the animals got so used to @entity16 , they started coming up to groom him , looking for insects in his hair and inspecting his camera equipment			1
why the long face ? ol ' @entity77 looks a bit down in the mouth for this perfect selfie @entity16 , a professional photographer for 15 years , says : ‘ these lovely little primates are particularly inquisitive and intelligent			1
they have amazing human - like characteristics , not least their “ punk ” hairdo			0
‘ but their red eyes seal the fascination for me ; they are unnerving when they make eye contact with you - a memory of our ancient ancestors , perhaps ? they started to get quite mischievous , jumping all over my equipment			0
at first the click of the lens scared them away , but they soon came back			0
’ he anchored the camera to a tripod , and then lay on the floor holding it so they could not carry it off			0
for the next half an hour , he let the monkeys fool around in front of the lens for the ultimate selfie session			0
@entity16 says : ‘ sure enough they put their muzzles right into the lens and starting snapping away			2
it was like the joy of seeing your new baby learn to play with a toy			0
’ me and my primates : @entity16 and a macaque hold hands for the photographer 's own selfie time for lunch : i know these taste good - but how do you open it ? just as in the human world , most of the selfie - snappers were females - macaques live in groups of up to 70 , dominated by one alpha male			1
the photoshoot came to an abrupt end when the male head of the clan decided his harem had monkeyed around enough			0
‘ he jumped on my back and gave me a thump , ’ says @entity16			2
‘ they have formidably large teeth , so i decided to call it a day			0
’ when he looked through the pictures , @entity16 knew he had something special			2
although hundreds of shots were blurry , four were perfectly in focus			0
when he released the pictures , he immediately got emails from people saying they had made them smile			0
but it was only when the selfie craze took off about 18 months ago , that the pictures became iconic as a reflection of how similar to us animals can be			0
@entity16 says : ‘ they show these monkeys are as fascinated with their own image as we are			1
’ the main threat to the crested black macaque is man hunting them for food			2
they are trapped as black - market meat and served as a delicacy			2
girls just wan na have fun : the inquisitive monkeys father around the camera is @entity47 there are estimated to be between 4,000 and 6,000 on the island , a fall of 80 per cent in the past 40 years			1
indeed , while @entity16 was in @entity47 he came across a close relative of the crested black macaque , a booted macaque , whose hand was stuck in a painful trap			1
‘ i got him released for a 20p packet of cigarettes as a bribe			0
the value of these monkeys ’ lives is astonishingly low , ’ he says			0
as well as the one - in - a - million shot that every wildlife photographer dreams of , @entity16 had hoped the pictures would raise awareness of the how endangered these animals are			1
but the selfies have instead turned into an international legal row			0
because monkeys ca n’t own copyright , the images have been added to @entity198 ’s bank of free images - and both the macaques and @entity16 miss out on royalties of tens of thousands of pounds			1
@entity16 says the income should come to him - with a share going to a conservation project to protect these endangered creatures			1
but despite the fight , @entity16 says : ‘ one day i would like to meet them again			2
i owe them all a big thank - you			0

@entity16 , 49 , followed black crested macaques around island of @entity47
gained their trust , and they played with camera gear - leading to selfies
one image is *controversial* because it is *unclear* whose the copyright is
a website claimed it is not *mr* @entity16 's because the monkey took it
