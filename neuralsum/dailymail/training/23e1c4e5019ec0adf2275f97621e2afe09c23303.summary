by @entity0 the battle over scallop stocks in the @entity3 escalated yesterday when militant @entity5 fishermen threatened to mobilise a 250 - strong armada to block @entity8 ferries			1
the ultimatum came as @entity8 trawlermen demanded @entity12 protection from the @entity5 who have already fired flares and rocks at their boats			1
the @entity5 – who also tried to ram @entity8 boats – are furious that ‘ @entity8 intruders ’ have been fishing for the lucrative mollusc in @entity20 , off the coast of @entity22			1
to the rescue : members of the @entity12 's @entity26 conflict : a @entity8 fishing trawler ( not pictured ) suspected of illegally dredging scallops was ordered into a @entity5 port today and her crew threatened with prison.this picture shows @entity5 and @entity8 boats during the first clash last year @entity37 laws prevent @entity8 vessels in this area from fishing within 12 miles of the @entity5 coast , but the @entity8 boats were at least 15 miles offshore when they were attacked			1
footage of the attack has been broadcast on @entity5 television and local newspaper @entity44 published a headline saying ‘ @entity46 is declared ’			1
warning : @entity5 scallop trader @entity47 now the @entity5 have threatened to launch a modern - day armada against the @entity8 , with 250 vessels set to cause havoc by blocking cross-channel ferries			1
@entity47 , a scallop trader at @entity52 , said : ‘ our government is doing nothing to protect us from the @entity8 intruders who are pillaging our livelihood			1
' we will not hesitate to call out 250 boats or more			0
our fellow trawlermen at the other ports are with us			0
our battle is their battle			0
‘ this situation is going to end badly			0
we will do what it takes to win the war			0
‘ we have enough boats along the @entity3 coast to cause disruption by blocking the ferries			2
we do n’t want to but if we have to , we will			0
’ @entity5 fishermen are demanding a ban of all fishing in the @entity73 in order to replenish its cash - rich stock of fish and scallops			1
they imposed a voluntary ban on fishing through the summer but when they returned on october 1 they were angry to see how much had been harvested by @entity8 boats			1
@entity8 fishermen believe the attack earlier this week had been premeditated because one of the 40 @entity5 vessels had a television cameraman and an interpreter on board			1
rude : @entity5 fisherman seen offering rude hand gestures and burning @entity92 rugby shirts during a dispute over scallop fishing areas the ‘ frightening ’ attack lasted for more than six hours and came to a halt only when a @entity98 vessel and the @entity5 coastguard intervened			1
the @entity12 was deployed to protect @entity8 fishermen during the @entity100 with @entity101 in the 1970s			1
in 1972 , @entity101 had declared an @entity102 beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing			0
this led to the @entity107 cutting the nets of @entity8 trawlers that fished in the area			1
the @entity8 retaliated by deploying @entity12 warships to protect @entity8 fishing crews			1
there followed a number of stand - offs between @entity8 and @entity101 vessels , which included them ramming each other			1
the lengthy dispute finally ended in 1976 when @entity101 threatened to close a vital @entity120 base in retaliation for the deployment of the @entity12			2
the @entity8 government conceded that @entity8 vessels would no longer fish within the disputed 200 - nautical - mile limit			1
now @entity8 fishermen are demanding protection from the @entity12 ’s three - strong @entity26 ( @entity128 ) which patrols the @entity8 ’s @entity129			1
@entity131 , of @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , had to call @entity135 for help when one of his skippers telephoned to say his crew were under attack			0
the crew of the vessel were forced to hide in the wheelhouse as rocks and iron bars were thrown			0
he said : ‘ the skipper was very concerned for his safety and the safety of the crew			0
‘ i could hear on the telephone the rocks and bricks raining down on the wheelhouse window			0
‘ @entity155 would be a welcome sight			0
' it would be comforting to know that we had some help nearby if things escalate again			0
’ the fps is the oldest front - line force in the @entity12 , dating back to 1481			1
its mission is to protect the extended fisheries zone – an area covering 80,000 square miles of sea and stretching up to 200 miles from the coastline			0
the squadron comprises three @entity168 – @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 – in @entity8 waters			2
a fourth – @entity174 – is stationed in the @entity175			0
frustration : angry @entity5 protestors have called on @entity37 authorities to impose a temporary ban on fishing for scallops claiming that overfishing had reduced sizes of shellfish and catches anger : @entity5 trawlers confront the larger @entity8 trawler , in the centre of the picture , during the standoff the 1,700 - tonne vessels , each with a crew of about 45 sailors , patrol @entity92 , @entity195 and @entity197 waters			1
@entity134 has its own fleet			0
they can operate with helicopters , carry two rigid inflatable landing craft and are armed with one 20mm gun and two general - purpose machine guns			2
however the @entity12 says it has no plans to send one of its three @entity168 vessels to the scene			2
instead @entity8 authorities are relying on the @entity5 government to deal with its fishermen and stop the ‘ @entity46 ’ from escalating			1
@entity211 , head of coastal operations for the @entity213 , said : ‘ we are continuing high - level discussions with @entity5 counterparts to seek assurances that these issues will not recur			1
’ tension : the @entity5 trawlers confronted the @entity8 following a dispute over fishing for scallops			1
this image shows a @entity8 trawler with catch of scallops but mr @entity47 added : ‘ we will do what we have to do to preserve the future of our industry			2
‘ for 25 years we have imposed a ban on fishing scallops during the summer up until the autumn			0
but the @entity8 are legally entitled to fish while we have to sit and watch			2
‘ what is making us even more angry is the fact that thousands of tons of the @entity8 - caught scallops are exported back to @entity5 and sold as local produce			1
’ @entity5 fishermen have proved true to their word when they have threatened a blockade in the @entity3			2
in 1996 , trawlermen sailed dozens of boats into the harbour mouth at the cross-channel port of @entity246 , roped themselves together and blocked its entrance			0
they delayed tens of thousands of passengers and hundreds of lorries for two days before the government gave into their demands for @entity37 benefits			0
what is crystal clear after this week ’s skirmish in the @entity3 is that the @entity8 fishermen were doing nothing wrong , writes analyst @entity258			1
they were dredging for scallops in international waters – defined as more than 12 miles from the coast – when they came under attack			2
the dispute is complex and its origins goes back years			0
the @entity5 have long accused @entity8 trawlers of over-fishing – and putting scallop stocks at risk – in and just outside their waters			1
for commercial reasons , they resent the fact that two thirds of the scallops caught by @entity8 boats are exported – with a large number ending up in @entity5 , undercutting their own shellfish prices			1
and they are frustrated by a self - imposed rule which bans @entity5 dredgers from catching scallops in the @entity283 off the @entity22 coast between may 1 and october 1			1
the ban – which extends to 15 miles from the @entity5 coast – does not affect @entity8 fishermen			1
this year rumours of a bumper year of scallops reached @entity8 ports in september			2
within days a dozen @entity8 boats were in international waters off the @entity22 coasts			1
by the time the @entity5 set sail on october 1 , they had missed out on weeks of rich pickings			2
the @entity5 concede that the @entity8 are acting lawfully			1
but they believe it is unfair that @entity8 boats can steam across the channel to pick the best scallops while they can only watch			2
the @entity303 authorities say the closed scallop season prevents over-fishing and allows the scallops to spawn in peace			0
but dr @entity308 of the government - funded @entity309 , said : ‘ as far as i ’m aware there is no particular scientific justification for that closed season			0
there are peaks in their spawning but you can find spawning scallops all year round			0
’ @entity320 , of the @entity321 , says the @entity5 closed season is a marketing ploy that owes more to protecting prices than protecting fish			2
‘ it ’s an arbitrary season , ’ he said			0
‘ we can only assume that it ensures the market is concentrated into the seven months of open season so they get a better price			0
’ scallop fishing is big business in @entity8			2
in the @entity8 , 50,000 tons of the shellfish worth about £ 54million are landed at ports each year			2
all but 2 per cent are caught by vessels using dredges – 3ft - wide spiked metal rakes that scrape along the seabed picking up the shellfish			0
it is a brutal and crude form of fishing that does untold damage to the sea floor and which is banned in the most important conservation areas			0
scallops are not endangered and there are no fixed @entity37 quotas restricting the size catches			0
but to prevent over-fishing , fisherman must follow complex rules covering the size of equipment , the type of dredgers , the size of scallops they can harvest and how many days they spend at sea each year			0
each @entity37 nation may dredge for scallops in its own coastal waters and in any international waters			0
but nations may set their own restrictions			0
just as the @entity5 have a closed summer season off @entity22 , @entity8 boats are banned from fishing for scallops in the @entity369 from june to the end of october			1
and just as @entity8 fishermen can ignore the @entity5 restrictions , there is nothing to stop a @entity5 boat looking for scallops in the summer off the coast of @entity195			1
in practice , they rarely bother because travelling so far is uneconomical			0
this week ’s tension partly stems from the failure of talks this year over the @entity73			0
@entity5 and @entity8 were close to a deal in which @entity8 boats would stay away from the area in the summer in exchange for being given some of @entity5 ’s unwanted ‘ days at sea ’ quota			1
but fishermen from @entity390 objected			0
they were concerned the @entity8 boats would head west and start competing with them .			2
