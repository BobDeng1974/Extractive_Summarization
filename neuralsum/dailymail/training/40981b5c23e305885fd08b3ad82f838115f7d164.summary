@entity0 - not her real name - who is pictured , was abused by an older man when she was a teenager and claims social workers knew what was going on a woman who was abused as a teenager told last night how social workers allowed her to have daily contact with a man ten years older than her who was suspected of grooming dozens of young girls for sex			1
@entity0 – not her real name – was one of 54 girls abused by the man she saw as her boyfriend , as well as his friends			1
she says that despite knowing he had served two stints in jail for violent crime and was part of a circle of men under investigation for sexual exploitation , social workers allowed her to leave her foster home at night to meet him			1
@entity0 said she was shocked to hear that , in fact , more than 1,400 girls had been victims of sexual exploitation in @entity32			1
now 29 , she is one of 15 girls bringing a civil case against the council and police			1
she said ‘ people at the top ’ had covered up what happened to her and the others			0
@entity0 added : ‘ they knew what he was capable of			1
they thought he was a pimp and was getting me into drugs			2
they ’re trained to recognise it and they were adults			0
they ’ve got to be stupid not to recognise the signs of abuse			2
' i was a child in danger – that should have been recognised			0
i think it is a massive cover - up			1
they knew it was happening – there are files showing they knew			1
' i think it was all done deliberately			0
they called me a liar and now all this comes out – it just shows the total lack of respect that council has for victims like me			2
’ @entity0 , pictured , had just turned 14 when she met her abuser through friends in 1999			2
he began contacting her every day and the pair soon started a relationship			0
even then the man was 24 , married and had already been in prison twice for violent crimes			0
@entity0 believes the authorities also suspected that he was part of a small group involved in the grooming and sexual exploitation of more than 40 teenagers in @entity32			1
but far from protecting @entity0 , she says bungling police and social services failed to halt his abuse and actually facilitated it			1
her desperate parents did everything they could to stop the relationship with the man , who has never been prosecuted for any sexual abuse against a child			2
they tried to stop her going out and even cut off the phone lines so he could n’t call			0
at one point her parents reported her as missing to the police , knowing she was with him			0
but instead of arresting him , @entity0 says police negotiated a deal whereby he handed her over to officers on a petrol forecourt on condition he would n’t be arrested			1
things took a more sinister turn when , after her 15th birthday , police found her semi-naked , hiding under a bed in a house			0
her parents then agreed to have her placed in care in the hope that it would finally break the abuser ’s hold over their daughter			0
but once in social care @entity0 was allowed to see her ‘ boyfriend ’ every day , despite the fact that he was increasingly violent and controlling			1
large - scale child exploitation in the town has been revealed in a damning report			0

incredibly , @entity0 says workers at the foster home where she was living sometimes allowed her to go out and see him at night			1
@entity0 believed the pair were in ‘ a normal relationship ’			2
she began skipping school to see him , and going missing from her home for longer periods			0
before she was 16 , he had got her pregnant twice			0
she said : ‘ they placed me in care thinking it would keep me away from him but the social workers said i could see him as long as i was home by 10pm and met him at the top of the street			1
at that time i thought it was a normal boyfriend - girlfriend relationship			2
‘ my family were on my case , saying he was dangerous and that he was too old for me but i did n’t listen			0
i was just a typical teenager , i thought my parents wanted to ruin my life			0
