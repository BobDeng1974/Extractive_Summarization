some 700,000 children in @entity1 aged five to 17 will be offered the treatment pupils will be vaccinated with a nasal spray this winter in a bid to stop the spread of flu			1
some 700,000 children in @entity1 aged five to 17 will be offered the treatment in what will be the biggest school immunisation pilot for 30 years			1
last year , the spray – called @entity15 – was offered to all children aged two and three but this year it will also be pitched to parents of all four - year - olds			1
and @entity1 ( @entity22 ) will trial the larger programme in primary and secondary schools to immunise pupils			0
dr @entity24 , head of flu at @entity22 , said : ‘ this is an ambitious campaign but with good reason , because studies have shown children are “ superspreaders ” of the flu virus			0
when they sneeze , they often wo n’t have a handkerchief or wash their hands , and protecting them will help to protect their parents , siblings and grandparents			0
‘ the pilot of 700,000 schoolchildren is to identify and iron out any issues we may have with the programme			0
’ although for most people flu is an unpleasant inconvenience , for others it can be deadly			0
@entity51 contributed to an estimated 8,000 deaths in @entity1 last year , mostly thought to be the elderly or infirm , or those with conditions such as asthma			1
dr @entity57 , medical director at @entity22 , described the spray as a ‘ quick , easy and painless ’ way to prevent children catching flu and spreading it to others who are more vulnerable			2
he added : ‘ people with certain long - term health conditions are at much greater risk of becoming seriously unwell if they catch flu and sadly , many end up in hospital			2
’ the government is today launching a major campaign to encourage adults to take advantage of the free flu jab			0
pregnant women , parents of young children and those with health problems are among those being targeted by officials			0
last year only half of those eligible for the injection took up the offer			0
the government ’s chief medical officer , professor dame @entity83 , said : ‘ i would urge those offered the free flu vaccination to visit their gp early in the flu season			2
’ the school nasal spray vaccination pilot is being run by 12 local authorities in the @entity92 , the @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
parents will receive letters inviting them to let their children receive @entity15 from the school nurse			2
doctors think the nasal spray has great potential to encourage uptake among children averse to needles			1
however , it costs twice as much as the flu jab , with the cost of immunising all children in @entity1 estimated to be £ 100million a year			1
the last time there was such a large - scale school immunisation pilot here was in 1984 when the @entity114 was introduced to fight @entity115 .			1

pupils aged five to 17 will be offered nasal spray treatment called @entity15
it is set to be the biggest school immunisation pilot for 30 years
but it will cost government £ 100million a year - twice as much as flu jabs
@entity51 contributed to around 8,000 @entity128 deaths last year
