by @entity0 @entity1 : the beauty queen now struggles to wear stilettos as a result of the crash a beauty queen received £ 18,000 in damages yesterday after a car crash left her unable to wear high heels comfortably			1
@entity1 , 24 , was hit by a @entity10 while driving , leaving her with back injuries that make slipping into stilettos a painful experience			1
incredibly , despite her injuries , the 24 - year - old went on to win the @entity18 @entity17 competition in 2010 following the collision in april the previous year , but her ability to take part in charity events has been limited because of continuing back pain			1
she raised an action at the @entity25 in @entity17 suing the other driver @entity26 , also of @entity17 , for damages following the collision			0
@entity26 admitted liability but he wanted to pay around £ 3,500 but miss @entity1 wanted closer to £ 20,000			1
the court heard that the accident occurred on april 10 in 2009 shortly after midnight in @entity17 ’s @entity32 clerk street as miss @entity1 returned home from working at a drinks promotion event			1
she was left shocked and distressed and suffered bruising to her chest and pain in her neck and back			1
the sales manager went home after the accident but later phoned @entity42 because she was in pain			2
a nurse said she should consult her gp and she was subsequently referred for physiotherapy , where miss @entity1 was later diagnosed with chronic low back pain			1
after deciding on the £ 18,000 compensation today , which included £ 10,000 for ' pain and suffering ' judge @entity51 said : ' the pursuer ( miss @entity1 ) is an attractive young woman and also carried out some work as a model , usually at charitable events			1
' she did not wish however to have a career as a model			2
' she was expected to wear high heels for this promotional work			2
doing so aggravated her back			0
' mr @entity61 said that after she won the @entity18 @entity17 contest her main duty was attend and take part in charity events			0
' her ability to participate in the usual range of such events was limited because of her continuing back pain , ' he said			2
payout : the @entity70 , pictured , heard today that she would be getting £ 18,000 - £ 10,000 of which was for pain and suffering ' the pursuer felt she was letting people down by not participating in as many events as , but for her back pain , she would other wise have done			1
she gave as an example various fun runs in which she was not able to participate			0
' in spite of her attractive looks and the promotional work which she carried out the pursuer was very much against women being employed on the basis of their looks			0
' she strongly opposed the @entity88 ( wives and girlfriends ) culture and part of her purpose in wishing to become miss @entity17 was to encourage young girls to be independent , to be their own boss and not to rely on men , ' he said			0
' she has adopted a sensible attitude to her continuing back problems			0
@entity99 knows she can wear high heels but will suffer the next day for doing so			2
it seems to me that rather than being criticised she should be commended for her efforts ' in the present case it is abundantly plain on the evidence that since the accident she has complained of and suffered intermittent lower back pain			2
she did not suffer such pain before the accident			0
' she is not exaggerating her injuries to enhance the value of her claim			0
if she is , it is a strange way of going about it			0
she returned to work , resumed part - time employment over and above her day job and continued her modelling and charity work , ' he said			0
the judge awarded her a total of pounds 18,281 , including pounds 10,000 for her pain and suffering .			1

@entity1 hurt her neck and back after her car was hit by a @entity127 that *undertook* her and then *swerved* back to avoid a parked car
the 24 - year - old can not wear heels without getting *severe* pain , which has hit her career
her payout included £ 10,000 for pain and suffering
