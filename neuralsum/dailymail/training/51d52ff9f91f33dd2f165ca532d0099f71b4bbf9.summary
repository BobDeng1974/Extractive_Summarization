by @entity0 it may soon be impossible to find a home in @entity4 for less than £ 100,000 after the handful of properties on the market for five figures are being quickly snapped up by buyers , experts have claimed			1
at the end of last year , just seven flats across the capital were on sale for less than £ 100,000 , the majority of which have now been sold			2
property experts claim a ' milestone ' has now been reached and it unlikely that freehold properties will drop under the £ 100,000 mark again unless there is a housing market crash			1
bargain buy : this one bedroom flat in lord @entity24 , @entity26 , @entity27 , is being advertised for sale at £ 90,000 tight squeeze : the property in lord @entity24 in @entity26 has a small living room decorated in pink and purple the kitchen of the @entity26 flat has also been painted yellow to match the outside of the building ' ideal for first time buyers ' : the property does have a good sized bathroom complete with a bath and shower unit research by @entity44 found it is now near impossible to buy a home in @entity4 for less than six figures unless they are sold at auction , are part of shared ownership schemes , retirement homes , student accommodation or house boats			1
@entity54 , founder of property search engine @entity44 , said : ' the @entity4 property market has reached a milestone			0
' this may be the last time we see properties under £ 100k being sold in the capital , well on land at least , as currently the only properties for sale under £ 100k are houseboats			1
' in other parts of the country you can buy a family home for under £ 100k - in @entity4 it wo n't even buy you a studio flat in one of the cheaper boroughs			1
just under six figures : a one bedroom flat in this apartment block in @entity75 , @entity4 , @entity27 , sold for £ 99,500 natural light : the kitchen in the @entity75 apartment has a large window - making it feel bigger estate agents believe properties such as this one in @entity75 will be one of the last in @entity4 to be put on the market under £ 100,000 snapped up : buyers are rushing to purchase the remaining five figure properties such as the one in @entity75 , pictured ' for many @entity87 on normal salaries , not @entity89 sized wages , home ownership is quite simply out of reach			1
' of the few remaining properties advertised for under £ 100,000 in recent months , these included four in the east or south - east of @entity4 and one in @entity96 - although this was only a short term lease			1
a one bed flat in @entity75 , @entity4 , @entity27 , sold for £ 99,500 while another one bed flat in lord @entity24 , @entity26 , @entity27 , is being advertised , under offer , for £ 90,000			2
described as an ideal purchase for a first time buyer , the @entity26 property has a lounge , bedroom , kitchen , bathroom and communal gardens			0
a studio flat in this apartment building in @entity113 , @entity4 , is being advertised for £ 84,995 one room for everything : a double bed and sofa can be seen inside the studio flat in @entity113 but the @entity113 studio flat does have a separate kitchen and bathroom a studio in @entity123 was on the market , also under offer , for £ 74,995 , while just one other studio apartment is still being advertised for sale in @entity113 for £ 84,995			1
a one bed flat for sale in @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , was on for £ 94,950 but received an offer of £ 110k			0
finally a two bed flat in @entity134 is on the market for £ 94,995 while a one bedroom flat in @entity113 is still being advertised for £ 89,000			1
this leaves bidding at auction or shared ownership as the only other option for finding a home for five figures			2
a studio flat in this converted property in @entity145 , @entity4 , @entity123 , was on the market for £ 74,995 the advertisement for the £ 74,995 studio in @entity145 , @entity4 , @entity123 , did not include any pictures of the inside of the property - just this floor plan there are currently three houseboats on offer in the capital - a one bed barge for sale in @entity123 for £ 99,000 , a houseboat in @entity159 for £ 87,000 and a houseboat near @entity161 for £ 80,000			1
@entity162 , managing director of online estate agents @entity164 , said : ' i 'm sure many people will be surprised that you could actually still buy something under £ 100k in @entity4			2
' the capital 's property market is so hot at the moment that in many boroughs you would probably struggle to find anything under £ 200k let alone £ 100k			2
' any quality stock coming onto the market is gong under offer within hours of the " for sale " boards going up			0
a one bedroom flat in @entity181 , @entity113 , @entity4 , being advertised for £ 89,000 the second floor flat in @entity113 has a kitchen , lounge , bathroom , one bedroom and a garage on site back to basics : the bathroom in the @entity113 one bedroom flat has been stripped down to the basic utilities ' and properties in the most popular areas are selling well over asking price as buyers compete against each other			1
' will we ever see properties under £ 100k again ? i 'm sure we will but do n't expect to get too much space for that kind of money			0
' also , the chances are if you 're spending less than £ 100k the property will not be in great condition			0
' you might buy at a knock down price , but the refurbishment could cost you thousands			0
' a one bedroom flat in this building in @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , was on the market for £ 94,950 but received an offer of £ 110,000 just five figures : a two bedroom flat for sale in @entity218 , @entity4 , for £ 94,995 it comes as private sector rents in @entity4 increased at eight times the pace of those in the @entity223 over 2013			2
every region across @entity225 saw an annual rise in average rental prices paid by tenants , but @entity4 recorded the biggest increase over the last 12 months at 1.6 per cent			0
the @entity223 saw the smallest increase at 0.2 per cent , according to the report from the @entity232 ( @entity232 )			0
the combination of increasingly higher rents and stagnate wages has sparked concern in recent years that tenants are becoming ' trapped ' in the rental sector because they can not save enough money for a deposit to make the jump onto the housing ladder			0
but government support schemes such as help to buy have resulted in some strong increases in first - time buyer numbers			0
but there 's always the option of a house boat ! this one bedroom house boat moored in @entity251 , @entity123 , is on the market for £ 99,000 living on the river : this barge moored in @entity255 in @entity159 in being advertised fro sale at £ 87,000 cheaper alternative : @entity258 , moored in @entity259 , is on the market for £ 80,000			0

vary from a studio flat in @entity113 to a two bed house in @entity134
the majority of the homes on sale for five figures have already been sold
experts believe the market has hit a ' milestone ' and it 's unlikely properties will drop below six figures in @entity4 unless there 's a crash
