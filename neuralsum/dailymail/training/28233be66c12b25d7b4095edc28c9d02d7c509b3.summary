@entity0 struggled to make an impression as @entity2 were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity3 on saturday , leading to suggestions that age and fatigue is starting to catch up with the 34 - year - old captain			1
the midfielder has played every minute of @entity2 's season so far and , judging by the statistics from the match at @entity13 , it 's taking its toll			1
@entity0 surrendered possession on 14 occasions , very unlike him , and only @entity18 ( 20 ) gave the ball away more in the @entity2 team			1
@entity0 looked well short of his best form in @entity2 's 3 - 1 loss to @entity3 on saturday @entity2 manager @entity23 issues instructions to @entity0 from the sidelines at @entity13 @entity0 was poor against @entity3 , as his stats from the game show			1
is age finally catching up with @entity2 ’s 34 - year - old captain ? @entity30 lost the ball 14 times			2
only @entity18 ( 20 ) lost it more for @entity2			0
11 he misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half , more than any @entity2 player			0
25 % @entity0 won just 25 per cent of his duels , the worst percentage of any @entity2 player			2
only six players in last year ’s top six squads are older than @entity0 , and most now play bit - part roles			0
the former @entity44 midfielder also misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half , more than any other @entity2 player , and that resulted in a poor passing completion rate of 57.7 per cent in @entity3 territory			1
he also won just 25 per cent of his duels , the worst percentage of any player in the team			0
@entity0 is pretty much unique in the @entity52 for the amount of minutes he 's expected to put in for his age and @entity23 will consider resting him for a game or two to restore him to somewhere near his best form			2
but that break of two or three games is out of the question			0
@entity0 should be nowhere near the midweek @entity60 tie with @entity61 but he 'll be needed in saturday 's @entity63 derby against @entity64			0
a tough trip to @entity66 in the @entity67 then follows			0
the international break that follows @entity2 's home match with @entity70 on october 4 ca n't come soon enough			1
his application ca n't be faulted , however			0
@entity0 ran 6.4 miles against @entity3 , second only to his midfield partner @entity74 , but his usual influence just was n't there			2
model professional gerrard has played every minute for @entity2 so far this season @entity0 's out - of - sorts performance led to suggestions that the 34 - year - old is showing his age tuesday @entity61 ( @entity81 ) @entity60 saturday @entity64 ( @entity81 ) october 1 @entity66 ( a ) @entity67 october 4 @entity70 ( @entity81 ) october 19 @entity82 ( a ) october 22 @entity83 ( @entity81 ) @entity67 having been away from @entity86 competition last season , @entity2 must now quickly reacquaint themselves with the punishing routine of playing @entity52 at the weekend and @entity67 on tuesday or wednesday			1
despite the scoreline in east @entity89 , @entity23 insisted afterwards that would n't be a problem : ' it 's a tiring competition , the @entity67 , but we 've earned the right to be in it and we also have to do well in the @entity52			1
' there 's the preparation time , the travel time , and then you need your players to recover after games in order to get ready for the next one			0
