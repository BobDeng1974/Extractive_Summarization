by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 12 october 2013 a woman found an unexploded bomb at the back of her neighbour 's garden when she popped over to help out by mowing the lawn			1
@entity7 was just about to start cutting the grass when she found the rusty object - lying on the top of the soil			1
the 67 - year - old recognised the device straight away and called police to the house in @entity16 , @entity17 , where she had been helping out while her neighbour , @entity19 , was at work			1
unexploded : the wartime bomb , which was said to have been found on top of the soil at the bottom of the @entity17 garden mrs @entity7 , who has lived in her house for 45 years , said : ' it is definitely the most remarkable thing i have ever dug up in the garden			1
' i always try to help out my neighbour @entity19 as much as i can , and it does n't take me long to mow my lawn so i decided to pop round and do her 's while she was at work			2
' i spotted it on top of the soil at the bottom of the garden , and my first thought was that it looked like a bomb			1
discovery : @entity7 , who found the bomb , said it brought back memories of her parents as her father served in the military ' she had some work men in the day before who were putting up some new fencing and posts			1
' they must have dug it up and left it - one of them had been hitting it with a spade ! ' they are lucky that it did n't go off			2
' i asked the police to pop round , and i think they thought i was joking at first			0
homes nearby were evacuated and the street was closed for over an hour as some 15 police officers turned up , mrs @entity7 said			1
a controlled explosion was then carried out by experts from the @entity66 on @entity16 beach , around three hours after the device was first discovered			0
: " we went round to a friend 's house for a coffee and she could n't believe what i 'd found , ' said mrs @entity7			2
the green - fingered neighbour , whose father had served in the @entity75 when she was a child , said finding the bomb ' brought back memories ' of her parents			1
' i knew what it was as soon as i laid eyes on it , ' she said			0
' i 'd seen deactivated bombs and replicas in museums before , and from watching old war films			0
' i had the strangest nights sleep after i found it , and i dreamt a lot about my mother			0
' i think that finding it must have triggered all of those old memories for me			0
' it 's amazing to think it has just been buried there all this time , and had the builders not dug up the soil , we might never have found it			2
' evacuated : the back garden of the house in @entity16 , where the bomb was found			1
the street had to be cleared while experts removed the bomb to detonate it mrs @entity7 's husband @entity107 added : ' it would be interesting to find out where it came from , and when it was dropped there			1
' we 've lived here for more than 40 years and it has been buried just metres away all this time			0
' these houses were built in the 1920s but before that it was all just fields and farmland around here , so it makes sense			0
' a spokesperson from @entity123 said : ' we received a call that a member of the public had found what was described as a large device thought to be a @entity130 bomb			2
' officers attended and the bomb disposal unit was called in to carry out a controlled explosion			2
' while it is not known where the bomb came from , the small @entity135 station of @entity136 lies on the outskirts of @entity16			0
