@entity1 chancellor @entity0 has fallen victim to hacking after a sophisticated computer virus was discovered on the usb drive of one of her aides			1
the @entity9 virus , which is believed to have been developed by @entity11 and @entity12 spying agencies , was detected after one of mrs @entity0 's employees plugged her personal drive into a work laptop			1
the woman , who works in close contact with mrs @entity0 , had loaded a speech she was editing on to the drive , took it home to continue working on it , before returning to the office			2
she had used the same drive the day before on work computers without causing an alert			2
checks on the @entity43 's 200 other computers showed no more traces of the virus , and officials said it would be impossible to trace whoever put the malware there			0
it is also not known what , if any , information was taken			0
@entity9 allows users to take pictures of a computer screen , take control of the mouse , record passwords and restore deleted files			1
staff working for the @entity1 government are prohibited from using personal drives on office computers for fear of transferring a virus , and it is not clear whether the staff member will be disciplined over the breach			2
the speech itself was believed to have been on @entity72 strategy and was almost certainly not the target of the hack , as it was due to be delivered publicly several days later			0
while sources at it security firm @entity77 have previously said the @entity9 virus was likely created by the @entity12 or @entity11 , it is not clear that either country was behind this attack			1
the virus code could have been downloaded from the internet by a third party before finding its way on to the aide 's hard drive			1
the @entity9 virus allows users to take control of a computer mouse , take snapshots of the screen , record passwords and restore deleted data			1
experts believe @entity12 or @entity11 spies are behind the sophisticated code however , the discovery of the virus will still likely prove embarrassing for the @entity11 as it comes after after the country 's spies were accused of bugging mrs @entity0 's phone earlier this year			1
whistleblower @entity101 claimed in october that the @entity11 @entity103 had been listening in on the calls of up to 35 prominent allies , including @entity106 and @entity1			1
that lead to claims @entity0 's personal mobile phone was tapped , and caused mrs @entity0 to demand answers from the @entity11 government			2
while @entity11 authorities never acknowledged whether spying took place , @entity112 was forced to offer mrs @entity0 an apology			0
reign is known as a @entity118 , a malicious piece of software which is hidden in other data and downloaded on to a laptop , tablet , or pc computer without the user knowing			0
according to web security firm @entity127 , the virus has been around since at least 2008 and may have taken years to develop			0
it is highly sophisticated , can have its capabilities tailored to each target , and carefully covers its own tracks			0
it is extremely difficult to detect , and even once it has been detected , it is difficult to identify what exactly the code is doing			0
the company says it has been used for spying against governments , businesses and private individuals since 2008 , and was updated some time in 2013 .			0

aide took usb drive home in order to work on @entity1 leader 's speech
returned to work next day and plugged drive in when virus was found
