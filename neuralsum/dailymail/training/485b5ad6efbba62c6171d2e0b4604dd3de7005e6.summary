by @entity0 last updated at 10:02 pm on 6th january 2012 labour leader @entity1 faced embarrassment yesterday after he bungled the task of sending a tweet to mark the death of @entity6			2
a tribute to the @entity9 host on his @entity11 account read : ‘ sad to hear that @entity6 has died			1
a generation will remember him fondly from @entity14			1
’ within minutes , the message was removed and replaced with the correct spelling of the game show			2
the mistake suggests the @entity20 leadership might still have thursday ’s race row on its mind , when shadow minister @entity23 apologised for tweeting that ‘ white people love playing divide and rule ’			1
just minutes ago the @entity20 leader took to @entity11 to pay tribute to @entity29 host @entity6 , typing ' sad to hear that @entity6 has died			1
a generation will remember him fondly from @entity14 ' correction : @entity1 hastily corrected his gaffe with the right spelling of blockbusters mr @entity1 ’s gaffe has sparked a @entity11 storm , with a competition establishing itself on the internet to come up with other fitting mistakes based on game show titles			1
examples included ‘ ready steady cock - up ’ , ‘ @entity44 ’ , ‘ @entity45 ’ , ‘ @entity46 ’ and ‘ eight out of ten cuts ’			0
some concentrated on his thorny relationship with leadership rival and brother @entity50 , such as ‘ @entity51 ’ and simply ‘ @entity52 ’			0
other genuine titles that tweeters suggested might be appropriate for mr @entity1 included ‘ @entity55 ’ , ‘ are you smarter than a ten year old ? ’ and ‘ @entity58 ’			0
then there were more suggested spoofs , including ‘ @entity61 ’ , ‘ @entity62 ’ , ‘ @entity63 ’ , ‘ universally challenged ’ , ‘ @entity64 or @entity65 ’ , ‘ @entity66 ’ and ‘ @entity67 ’			0
at one point yesterday , the competition was the most popular subject on @entity11			1
meanwhile , miss @entity23 became embroiled in yet another race row yesterday after it emerged she had accused taxi drivers of racism in another tweet earlier in the week			1
@entity1 quickly deleted his mis - spelled tribute to @entity6 , who died today at the age of 83 who 's that ringing ? an unrepentant @entity23 takes a call and the @entity20 leader tells her to apologise whoops ! @entity1 's tweet has been trending on @entity11 this afternoon @entity85 cabbies attacked her suggestion that they do not pick up black passengers			1
she had tweeted : ‘ dubious of black people claiming they ’ve never experienced racism			2
ever tried hailing a taxi i wonder ? ’ @entity93 , a spokesman for the @entity94 said miss @entity23 was indulging in the ‘ stereotypes of the 1960s ’ , and that many drivers now were black and @entity98			2
‘ at worst she is racist and at best she is stupid in making comments like that , ’ he said			2
‘ either way , she should go			0
’ mr @entity1 has endured one of his most difficult weeks as @entity20 leader – being attacked in print by his guru and criticised by one of his frontbenchers			0
on tuesday , academic @entity108 , who received a peerage on mr @entity1 ’s recommendation last year , wrote that the leader had ‘ no strategy , no narrative and little energy ’			0
a day later , a memo written by @entity20 spin doctor @entity116 was reduced to claiming that mr @entity1 was not as bad an opposition leader as @entity118			0
and on thursday , it emerged that the party ’s defence spokesman , @entity120 , was distancing himself from @entity20 ’s attacks on government spending cuts			0
he told @entity124 that @entity20 ’s credibility depended on rejecting ‘ shallow and temporary ’ populism			0
@entity128 's comment about ' divide and rule ' caused a @entity11 storm and led to calls for her resignation the full conversation between @entity23 and freelance journalist , @entity136 following the sentencing of @entity139 's killers miss @entity23 responded , saying that her comment had been ' taken out of context '			1

comes after he was forced to phone @entity23 yesterday to demand she apologise for @entity11 comments about white people
