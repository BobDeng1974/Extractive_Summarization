so dramatic has @entity1 's slide down the table been in 2014 - 15 that even if they won every single match until the end of the @entity6 campaign they would still not reach last season 's tally of 84 points			1
@entity11 ' side impressed fans across the country with their swashbuckling style last season and finished second only to @entity16 , scoring 101 goals in the process			0
but the current campaign has seen a significant drop in form , with the @entity22 having won just nine matches and accumulated a mere 32 points from their 21 matches this season - leaving @entity11 ' team a lowly eighth in the @entity6			1
in the unlikely event the @entity22 won every single one of those 17 matches , they would only reach 83 points			1
nevertheless , @entity1 will be determined to accumulate as many wins as they can between now and the end of the season - starting with @entity30 on saturday			0
@entity55 , who cost Â£ 16million from @entity56 , has struggled to fill the void left by @entity37 last season @entity1 's swashbuckling approach saw them finish second to @entity16 the @entity22 head to @entity59 to take on a side who have scored just 11 league goals all season			0
but despite that , @entity11 ' record against the @entity30 boss is hardly inspiring - he has won just twice in seven meetings with @entity68 , with the @entity69 claiming victory on four occasions ( plus one draw )			0
however , @entity11 ' two victories against @entity68 have come at @entity59 on the two most - recent occasions @entity1 have visited @entity74 - with a 2 - 1 win in march 2013 followed up by a 1 - 0 triumph in august the same year			2
and @entity1 will also be looking for revenge following the 1 - 0 reversal they suffered against @entity30 at @entity79 in september , when @entity80 netted the only goal to send @entity68 's men home with all three points			2
@entity68 ( left ) has only lost twice to @entity11 during their managerial careers ( in seven matches ) @entity1 did win at @entity30 last season though , with @entity87 ( right ) scoring from the spot @entity80 grabbed @entity30 's winner at @entity79 back in september @entity30 ( a ) - saturday january 17 , 3pm kick - off @entity91 ( @entity92 ) - saturday january 31 , 3pm kick - off @entity94 ( a ) - saturday february 7 , 5.30pm kick - off @entity96 ( @entity92 ) - tuesday february 10 , 8pm kick - off @entity98 ( a ) - sunday february 22 , 4pm kick - off @entity16 ( @entity92 ) - sunday march 1 , 12pm kick - off @entity101 ( @entity92 ) - wednesday march 4 , 8pm kick - off @entity103 ( a ) - saturday march 14 , 3pm kick - off @entity33 ( @entity92 ) - saturday march 21 , 3pm kick - off @entity106 ( a ) - saturday april 4 , 3pm kick - off @entity108 ( @entity92 ) - saturday april 11 , kick - off tbc @entity109 ( a ) - saturday april 18 , 3pm kick - off @entity111 ( a ) - saturday april 25 , 3pm kick - off @entity113 ( @entity92 ) - saturday may 2 , 3pm kick - off @entity115 ( a ) - saturday may 9 , 3pm kick - off @entity117 ( @entity92 ) - saturday may 16 , 3pm kick - off @entity119 ( a ) - sunday may 24 , 3pm kick - off			1

@entity1 finished second in the @entity6 last season with 84 points
@entity11 ' men are eighth in the table this season after 21 matches
even if they win all of 17 remaining games , @entity22 can only reach 83 points
reds face @entity30 in the @entity6 on saturday
@entity11 has *beaten* @entity68 just twice in his managerial career
