' claims : @entity1 rubbished claims from a former inmate of @entity4 's @entity8 that it had purchased disposable headphones manufactured by prisoners at the jail investigation : @entity10 announced it had suspended its current sourcing arrangements pending an investigation he claimed some prisoners ' hands were left ' deformed ' by the repetitive nature of producing the intricate inductors , which he said inmates made by winding copper wire around a ceramic cylinder			1
another inmate , who withheld his name , also told the @entity77 newspaper he had made inductors and headphones for @entity10 while serving time at @entity8			1
' we also made them for @entity11 , @entity1 and lots of others , ' he said			1

' the allegation that our supplier of economy class headsets , which is in @entity109 , used a third party company in @entity4 to help fill an order contradicts the verbal and written assurances we 've had from this supplier that their supply chain process met our standards - including the ethical treatment of workers			0
' to be clear , @entity10 has no relationship with the @entity4 - based company at the centre of @entity16 's claims , ' the statement goes on , insisting that the airline conducts regular audits of factories to ensure the strict conditions it places on suppliers are met			1

he added that while the firm 's audits had indicated no cause for concern , any evidence of the kind of production methods outlined in the @entity16 report would be ' completely unacceptable ' to @entity46 and against the company 's code of practice			0
