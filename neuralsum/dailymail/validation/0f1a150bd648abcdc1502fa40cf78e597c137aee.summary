they have been blamed for casting a shadow over urban areas and occasionally creating a ' death ray - style ' beam of sunlight capable of melting cars on the street			0
so architects have now designed skyscrapers which do n't block out the light by diffusing it onto a wide area in a bid to tackle the problem of shade encroaching on public space in @entity17			1
the revolutionary ' @entity19 ' design is the brainchild of architects @entity21 , who used a computer program to design two buildings , which work together to disperse and refract sunlight			1
they are designed so that when one building creates shade , the other can act as a huge curved mirror , allowing the light to be reflected downwards into its shadow			2
architects have designed skyscrapers which do n't block out the light by diffusing it onto a wide area the theoretical development has been touted for construction at the @entity41 , close to the @entity42 , but similar buildings could be constructed in cities all over the world			1
@entity46 , @entity21 's design director , said : ' the relationship between the sun and shadow is the relationship between the two buildings			1
he said the project is about ' improving the quality of our urban environment ... finding a way in which we can have the tall buildings we need without losing natural light on the areas below '			0
mr @entity46 hopes that architects will use this type of modelling to see how their designs will affect the light levels around their buildings			2
the revolutionary ' @entity19 ' design is the brainchild of architects @entity21 , who used a computer program to design two building the theoretical development has been touted for construction at the @entity41 , close to the @entity42 he said the method could also be adapted to control how much sunlight is reflected at different times of year			1
it is hoped that the design would avoid a repeat of @entity17 's disastrous ' @entity76 ' dubbed the ' @entity77 ' which directed fierce beams of sunlight capable of melting cars on the street			2
@entity83 , head of the @entity84 ( @entity85 ) forum , said the ' no @entity19 ' design was a ' perfectly feasible ' theory			0
he added that one of the problems people have with skyscrapers is the long shadows they cast : ' if you can reduce that , that must be a good thing			0
' they are designed so that when one building creates shade , the other can act as a huge curved mirror , allowing the light to be reflected downwards into its shadow planning permission has been approved or is pending approval for 236 new high - rise buildings in central @entity17 , pictured is the @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity76 dr @entity109 , an expert in tall buildings at the @entity112 's @entity111 , said : ' what 's great about the project is the focus on tall - building form and shape , not only to look dramatic , but to contribute to creating a comfortable space at ground level			1
' planning permission has been approved or is pending approval for 236 new high - rise buildings in central @entity17			0
described by the @entity85 as a ' veritable tsunami of towers ' , most will be apartment blocks rising from a minimum of 20 storeys to the current permitted maximum of 75			0
@entity128 's @entity127 has moveable mirrors that reflect light onto shaded areas below or block the sun during the hot summer			0
it is hoped that the design would avoid a repeat of @entity17 's disastrous ' @entity76 ' which directed fierce beams of sunlight capable of melting cars on the street the ' @entity76 ' was dubbed the ' @entity77 ' after reflected light caused damage to cars and other buildings			2
