by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 20:02 est , 30 august 2012 @entity1 follows @entity2 and his wife @entity3 ’s various misfortunes as they battle against the trials of modern life			1
and in a case of life imitating art , the actress who played @entity3 is embroiled in her own suburban struggle			1
@entity11 , 78 , is locked in a dispute with developers after she learnt of plans to build ‘ ugly and intrusive ’ retirement homes on her doorstep			1
' offended ' : @entity11 and neighbour @entity17 at the site of the proposed residential home indeed , the actress may well be tempted to use @entity2 ’s immortal catchphrase ‘ i do n’t believe it ’ to vent her frustration			1
miss @entity11 , who lives in @entity23 , south - west @entity24 , said she was ‘ deeply offended ’ by the design of the homes and criticised developers for failing to ask residents for their views			1
the actress ’s house backs on to land belonging to @entity33			2
after 15 years of wrangling , plans for its redevelopment are now in an advanced stage			0
part of the site will be turned into a care centre with two gp surgeries			0
developers also want to turn a car park area into a retirement home for 51 residents , plans which @entity11 objects to			1
the actress said : ‘ what angers me is the high - handed way it ’s been done			1
we have n’t been consulted			0
i ’m deeply offended by the design			1
this is for people aged 80 and over			0
i look at this and i think this has just not been done with any compassion or interest or empathy			0
it ’s been done because the @entity62 needs money and needs the developers to do what they need to do to the hospital			2
it looks like a warehouse			2
‘ i do n’t care what they decorate the facade with			0
fifty - one people my age and over are going to be squashed in there just so that the development can go ahead			1
’ ' i do n't believe it ! ' : @entity11 with her @entity1 co-star @entity77 , who plays @entity2 @entity17 , another resident , described the plans as ‘ ugly , intrusive and monolithic ’			1
he said : ‘ we live in a lovely road and it ’s going to be horribly affected by this huge monolithic building			0
it ’s a big thing and will potentially ruin our street			0
‘ our street is part of the conservation area and there ’s a directive that says any development in such an area should preserve and enhance the area and should not adversely affect it			2
our contention is that it ’s going to ruin it substantially			0
’ a spokesman for developers @entity96 and @entity97 said : ‘ our strength lies in our experience of building superb homes tailored to the needs and aspirations of our older residents , promoting independence and allowing older people to continue to lead healthy and active lives			2
‘ our plans aim to meet the needs of residents keen to remain in @entity110			0
‘ the proposal would offer an opportunity to introduce a sensitive form of development , which is designed to complement the surrounding area and blend with the design of the new hospital			1
’ the development is part of the @entity62 ’s plan to modernise care facilities and provide more services			0
the plans are due to go before a planning committee on september 6 .			0
