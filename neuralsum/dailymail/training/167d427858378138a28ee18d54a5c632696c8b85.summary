@entity0 is set to drop £ 12million @entity1 as he admits there is one simple solution to easing the pressure on his position – victory at @entity8 on saturday			1
the @entity10 boss has endured another week of intense speculation regarding his future following monday ’s televised 1 - 0 loss at @entity14			1
fans on the street have started to let their feelings be known and defeat at @entity8 would make for an uncomfortable international fortnight			1
@entity1 ( left ) passes the ball whilst being challenged by @entity21 during training on thursday @entity10 boss @entity23 under intense pressure to turn around the club 's fortunes owner @entity27 will not sack @entity0 , regardless of saturday afternoon ’s outcome , but the @entity30 manager does not want to rest on that assumption			1
indeed , he tore in to some of his players on the training ground this week and we understand he will shake up team selection against the @entity37			2
@entity1 – their marquee summer signing – is almost certain to be axed after a string of weak and ineffective performances , while @entity42 and @entity43 are also under threat			1
@entity45 will come in for his first @entity47 start in 18 months			1
and @entity0 said : ‘ we have n’t got time to wait for players to come through			1
we need that to happen now			2
‘ @entity1 has got to start performing now			1
our younger players like @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and ( @entity54 ) @entity53 have got to deliver now , we are n’t hanging about anymore			2
‘ it ’s important we step up to the plate			2
’ @entity42 ( 3rd from right ) smiles with teammates ( seen left to right ) @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity43 and @entity52 during training and , when asked what it would take to ease the scrutiny on his position , @entity0 said : ‘ i have to win a game to calm it down a little bit , particularly for the players			1
‘ they need the confidence of a win			2
@entity14 is a tough game but @entity8 is even tougher			1
‘ normally if we went there and came away with a draw and played well i would be quite pleased			0
‘ but that probably is n’t going to be enough to take the spotlight off us			0
i have to accept that			0
‘ only if we win will it take the spotlight away a little bit			0
it is still going to be around us			0
i am trying to get everyone to understand in my training ground that is n’t going to go away			0
it will be here a while and we need to be strong			0
’ the players remain behind the manager , evidenced by televisions inside the training ground being turned off when speculation centres on their boss			2
but they need to return on that support on the pitch			0
@entity0 added : ‘ the characters will grow as we go along			1
this is a difficult club to play for , i think			0
owner @entity27 has stuck by under - fire @entity10 boss @entity0 ‘ it can be the greatest club in the world to play for when you are winning , but we are not winning , so it becomes even harder to play for us , and we need to make sure we can handle that			1
‘ these players are going to learn more in the next six weeks than they have for the last two years of their careers			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , refused to be drawn on the suggestion that the current squad has been left short in key areas by the failings of a transfer model in which he does not have autonomy on incomings			2
‘ the way players are brought in , it ’s obviously a process that we go through , but the model is to buy younger players , and that makes it difficult if you are not winning , ’ he said , chief scout @entity113 the man responsible for the bulk of recruitment			0
‘ we have produced some fantastic signings at this football clubs – i do n’t think anyone would deny that – so we ca n’t suddenly say we have got it all wrong and this is the wrong model and these are the wrong players			0
’ disgruntled supporters display ' @entity133 ' banners against @entity14			0
