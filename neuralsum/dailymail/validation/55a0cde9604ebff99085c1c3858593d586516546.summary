the real victim : @entity1 spent three weeks in jail after falsely being accused of rap a businessman who spent three weeks in jail after falsely being accused of rape by a woman he met on the internet is suing the police for malicious prosecution and wrongful imprisonment			1
@entity1 , a former boyfriend of @entity13 ’s sister @entity12 , said his reputation has been destroyed and he lost his business because police failed to investigate properly the woman ’s fictitious allegations – including that he possessed firearms – or the glaring inconsistencies in her story			1
the 28 - year - old former spa owner was arrested at his home in @entity24 shortly after spending two days with the woman			1
his accuser gave a harrowing but entirely false account of being tied up and moved around the north - east of @entity27 against her will , after a sexual encounter turned terrifyingly violent			1
mr @entity1 , who has lived in @entity30 since the age of three , was dragged from his bed by the police , handcuffed and questioned for three days without legal representation before being charged with multiple counts of rape and kidnapping			1
on the basis of the woman ’s lies , @entity38 declared he was ‘ a danger to women ’ and he was remanded in jail for three weeks			1
last week the @entity45 called for people accused of sexual offences to be given anonymity			2
mr @entity1 ’s lawyer has referred the case to the @entity51			1
@entity52 , of @entity53 , said : ‘ it illustrates the flaws of a legal system that names and shames those accused of sex crimes , without giving them any protection when the accusations turn out to be untrue			2
' even though it was obvious in court that the woman lied and lied , she is still protected by the legal system because no criminal charges have so far been brought against her			1
' as things stands she has a lifetime anonymity while my client remains tainted by the abhorrent stigma of a rape charge			1
it ’s also clearly a case that would not have gone to trial if the police had done their jobs correctly			1
it was as if they could n’t be bothered			2
’ mr @entity1 was acquitted when his trial at @entity79 collapsed last year due to glaring discrepancies in the prosecution case			1
but he said that by then the damage had already been done			0
‘ the judge directed the jury to acquit me , but my reputation was left in tatters , ’ he says			1
‘ there are people out there who think , “ no smoke without fire ”			0
@entity92 's former girlfriend @entity12 is pictured right with her brother @entity13 ‘ it is grossly unfair that my details have been in the media , while my accuser gets away without a blemish to her name			1
rape is one of the most repulsive crimes there is			1
‘ a false claim not only ruins the lives of innocent men , but it damages their families			1
i did nothing wrong and yet this case almost destroyed me			1
’ he is supporting the demands of @entity113 mps @entity112 and @entity114 – both cleared after being falsely accused of rape – that the accused also remain anonymous , unless convicted			1
what mr @entity1 describes as ‘ the most terrifying period ’ in his life began in august 2013 when he responded to a ‘ friend request ’ on @entity118 from a beautiful blonde woman he had never met before			1
the law prevents us from naming her even though the court found her allegations to be entirely false			1
he says : ‘ she was very attractive			0
we texted and skyped each other before meeting			0
she was the driving force behind our meeting and i was flattered by her attention			0
’ during their time together mr @entity1 took the woman to restaurants , a club and they stayed in two hotels which she booked and paid for			1
he also drove her home to pack an overnight bag and spent 30 minutes talking with her mother			1
‘ my accuser was alone in her room upstairs and could have used her phone to call for help if i had been the mad rapist she made me out to be , ’ he added			0
‘ i told all of this to the police questioning me			2
' i also gave them the passwords to my phone and laptop so they could check the correspondence between us			0
’ he still has text messages she sent after they parted			0
there were also numerous cctv images of the pair cuddling , kissing and holding hands			0
@entity157 ( pictured ) killed herself after being accused of making a false rape claim @entity157 , 23 , killed herself last april after being accused of making a false rape claim against @entity160 , son of a @entity162 shipping magnate			1
police dropped the case against mr @entity160 because of insufficient evidence			1
mr @entity160 , 35 , said the allegation has devastated his life			0
@entity168 , 21 , was president of @entity169 when arrested after a false rape claim in may last year			1
he was held in a cell for 12 hours before being released on police bail			2
the case never came to court			2
the alleged victim has exercised her right to have it reviewed			0
@entity177 , 33 , from @entity178 in @entity179 , was stabbed and attacked by a mob after he was wrongly accused of rape			2
his accuser , @entity183 - @entity182 , was later jailed for 20 months			0
‘ there was ample @entity186 evidence and witnesses to prove she was all over me in public , but the police did n’t seem to be interested in proving my innocence			2
they seemed convinced they had their man , ’ he says			0
‘ when the female officer told me i would be remanded because i was a danger to women and a flight risk , my legs buckled			0
i had done nothing wrong , yet i was facing a lengthy prison sentence if found guilty			0
’ further charges for firearms offences and a threat to kill were dropped because no weapon was found in his flat			0
once mr @entity1 ’s case came to trial , alarming discrepancies emerged			1
the accuser claimed she had known her attacker for years			0
yet in her opening message on @entity118 , she admitted they ’d never met			0
she said she had been tied up and moved around against her will			0
yet it emerged she texted her boyfriend to tell him she was ok			2
‘ she told the court i had stolen her phone and written the text , ’ mr @entity1 says			0
‘ but this fell apart when it was revealed she had also texted her friend to say happy birthday and called her mum while we were together			0
’ incredibly , the police did not examine the outgoing texts or calls from her mobile			2
by the time the judge instructed the jury to acquit him , his name had been reported , his bank accounts frozen on order of the police , and he ’d lost his salon			2
‘ i lost everything , ’ he says bitterly			0
‘ i was even evicted from the gated community where i lived after women residents complained about living with a potential rapist			0
’ but what hurts him most is that the stigma of being a rapist still follows him ‘ like a bad smell ’			0
it is the key factor – along with his financial losses – in his decision to sue the police			2
‘ i want it made clear i did nothing wrong and i was the real victim			0
’ a spokesman for @entity38 confirmed there was ongoing correspondence but made no further comment			0
