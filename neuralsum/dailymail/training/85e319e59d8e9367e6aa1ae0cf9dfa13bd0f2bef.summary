previously , @entity58 reported a forklift operator ' opened the sealed crate and noticed damage to one of the crates in the form of a puncture from a forklift			0
it was a hole large enough to put your arm in			2

' officials have not disclosed who the money was meant for or why it was being sent			0
no comment ? @entity84 , spokesman for the @entity9 in @entity12 , declined to provide further information			2
but the @entity54 reports that the agency is performing lie detector tests on @entity7 employees investigators are now looking in to how many mechanics , crew members and airport personnel had access to the jet and whether any of them could feasibly have emptied the box and escaped unnoticed			1
according to the @entity97 , $ 1 million in $ 100 bills is estimated to weigh just 22 pounds , meaning a thief could easily cart around the cash			1

at the time it was also the largest cash theft to have been carried out on @entity106 soil and went on to be portrayed in the movie ' @entity107 '			0
