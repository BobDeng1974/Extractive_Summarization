by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 admits there are no more excuses after persuading owner @entity5 to invest £ 40million in his @entity7 squad this summer			1
the @entity9 manager signed off from last season with supporters calling for him to be sacked after a horrendous run of 15 defeats in 21 from @entity14 onwards			2
that led to a frank discussion between @entity2 and his billionaire boss and the upshot was nine new players , headed by £ 12m @entity21 playmaker @entity20			1
ready to go : @entity7 players train ahead of their season opener against @entity24 good business : @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) are among the players signed by @entity2 top acquisition : summer signing @entity20 is expected to play a major role for @entity7 this season and , ahead of sunday 's opener at home to champions @entity24 , @entity2 said : ‘ it was fairly obvious that he ( @entity5 ) listened to me at the back end of last year and the support i ’ve had in terms of the new signings is exactly what was needed			1
‘ i ’ve nothing to moan about now in terms of what ’s happened this summer			2
we ’ve got a strong squad , perhaps the biggest and best i ’ve ever had in terms of options , so we ’re in a great position			0
’ he went on : ‘ when i signed the new ( eight - year ) contract , @entity5 always knew there would be ups and downs for both of us			1
‘ he stood by me and this feels like an up time for me			0
he ’s armed me again			0
stand by me : @entity2 is delighted with the way @entity7 owner @entity5 has backed him this summer ‘ one thing i can always give him is an honesty of where we are and he listens – that ’s why so many players have entered the building , we needed them			1
‘ it ’s that kind of relationship you can only hope for as a @entity72 manager and i ’m lucky enough to have it			2
i hope i can repay him this season			0
’ @entity2 , then , is under pressure to deliver from the off and fans , disillusioned at the manner in which last season fell away , are also demanding an instant return			1
‘ i have to live with ( the pressure ) constantly because i live in the city , i ’m surrounded by fans and they remind me constantly , ’ he said			0
‘ i have to shield myself a little bit and almost put myself in a bubble , of trying to do the job to the best of my ability			0
