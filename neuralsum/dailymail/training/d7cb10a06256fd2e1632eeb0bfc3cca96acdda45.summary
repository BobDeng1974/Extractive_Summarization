last updated at 3:49 pm on 25th february 2012 the head of @entity2 's biggest drugs company has accused the government of systematically delaying the introduction of new cancer drugs in order to save money			1
@entity9 chief executive sir @entity8 warned that ministers were making false economies as they tried to grapple with the deficit in the public finances			1
in an interview with the @entity15 , he said that governments across @entity17 had already cut drug prices by 5 per cent a year - costing @entity9 around £ 300 million per annum			2
warning : sir @entity8 , head of @entity9 , warns that government attempts to save money by delaying the introduction of new drugs is a false economy however , he said governments were now seeking to go further in an effort to achieve even bigger savings - and he highlighted @entity2 's decision to delay new cancer treatments			1
' the bit i 'm much more frightened about is that what 's now beginning to become clear is that , in addition to price reductions , governments are delaying the approval of innovative new drugs , ' he said			1
' so a second way they can save money , they think , is ' let 's just not buy the next round of innovation '			2
' cancer in the @entity2 is a good example where we 're seeing oncology drugs being systematically delayed from introduction and reimbursement			1
' we are seeing a variety of the more innovative and more expensive medicines being delayed in a whole series of different diseases across @entity17			0
' not an option : the drug @entity54 , made by the firm @entity56 to treat breast cancer , was one of the drugs rejected by @entity60 and is therefore not available on the @entity61 sir @entity8 accused governments of treating the pharmaceuticals industry as a ' simple procurement business ' without understanding the wider implications of their decisions			1
' as governments have got more and more anxious about their debt positions and austerity agendas , what happened is quite predictable , ' he said			0
' if you are a minister and you need to cut costs , it is a lot easier to cut drug prices than it is to close a hospital or reduce the size of the @entity80			0
' the issue here is , of course , if you do n't buy the new drug it is going to save you money in the drug bill			2
but the drug bill is only 8 per cent to 10 per cent of the total healthcare bill and what is being lost in this stampede for cost cut is any kind of strategic thoughtfulness			0
' professor @entity97 , of @entity98 , said a number of new cancer drugs had been blocked by the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , which assesses the cost - effectiveness of new treatments			1
rough treatment : professor @entity97 said @entity60 had blocked a number of new cancer drugs ' in my view , @entity60 has over-regulated and proscribed drugs that offer real advances to people with cancer , ' he told the @entity113 4 today programme			1
' in my particular area of specialisation , which is prostate cancer , we have had two new drugs become available over the last year and a half which offer real benefits for patients			0
' i would argue that they have been disallowed - banned - by @entity60 on the basis of an assessment which is not a true financial costing of the worth of the drugs			1
' he warned that drug companies may soon no longer find it worthwhile to seek approval for their products in @entity2			1
' the regulation is such in this country that it is not worthwhile for the drug companies making the effort of actually negotiating with our regulatory authorities for the sale of their products in the @entity2			2
it is a complete loss - leader for them - waste of time , ' he said			0
' we are going to have a situation in the @entity2 where drugs are not available for our patients			1
someone just needs to sort this out			0
' a @entity152 spokesman hit back at the criticism of its spending and of the decisions taken by @entity60			2
he said : ' the government has increased spending on health , which includes new drugs , and thousands more patients are getting access to the most advanced treatments			2
' this includes the 11,000 extra patients who have benefited from the setting up of our £ 650 million @entity167			0
' the need for careful assessment of drugs ' effectiveness by @entity60 is particularly important for patients and taxpayers during a time of economic austerity			1
' the government has not changed any assessment processes relating to cancer drugs			0
' furthermore , drug companies need to look hard at the high costs they are asking of the health service for their latest treatments			0
' shadow health secretary @entity185 accused @entity186 of breaking his general election commitment to cancer patients			0
" with a great fanfare , he said he would deliver quicker access to drugs for cancer patients			0
today we hear that his government is in fact delaying new treatments to save money , " he said			1
" if true , this is a shameful state of affairs and a false economy			0
the prime minister must be kept to his pre-election promises			0
