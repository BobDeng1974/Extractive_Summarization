in a moment of need , many people call on @entity3 to help them			1
now , a study has found that just being reminded of @entity3 gives people the courage to seek out and take risks			1
psychologists suggest that religious people are willing to take risks because they believe @entity3 will protect them from harm			1
a study has found that reminders of @entity3 give people courage to seek out and take risks			1
for example , those who saw adverts included a mention of @entity3 – for example , ‘ @entity3 knows what you ’re missing ! find skydiving near you , ’ were more inclined to click on it , with a view to taking risks the study , published in @entity29 , a journal of the @entity31 , goes against previous research that suggest religious people are less likely to engage in risky behaviour , such as gambling			1
from bumper stickers to colloquial expressions , references to @entity3 pervade daily life , said lead researcher @entity39 of @entity40			1
‘ in fact , the word “ @entity3 ” is one of the most common nouns in the @entity44 language			0
‘ the fact that reminders of @entity3 are so ubiquitous suggests that this effect may impact a large number of people			2
’ previous studies have indicated religious people are less likely to gamble or take drugs – seen as risky behaviours – but ms @entity39 and her colleagues noticed that the risks examined in these studies tended to share a negative moral component			1
psychologists suggest that religious people ( illustrated with a stock image ) are willing to take risks because they believe @entity3 will protect them from harm an free app called @entity65 lets people send prayers or words of encouragement - regardless of religious persuasion - to others who are having a difficult time			1
this can be in the form of public posts , or in private groups with friends as well as strangers			0
a ticker on the site shows that more than 33 million prayers have been posted using the app in 195 countries , which is the equivalent of 192 years of prayers			0
the name is n't restricted to religious people , it can be used by anyone with spiritual beliefs or people who want to discover and discuss world events			2
members of the @entity65 community can post prayers and encouragement publicly or create private groups			0
they can also join more broad - based groups that focus on global issues concerning peace in the @entity101 , victims of natural disasters , or a cure for @entity105 , for example			0
the researchers hypothesised that thinking about @entity3 may have a different effect in relation to risks that have no moral connotation , such as doing a bungee jump , since people tend to view @entity3 as a source of protection and security			1
to investigate , they issued online surveys to nearly 900 people and found that those who were reminded of @entity3 - either by working on word scrambles that included @entity3 - related words or by reading a paragraph about @entity3 - were more willing to take risks than participants who were n’t prompted to think about religion			1
in one study , for example , participants were asked to choose which version of the study they wanted to complete			0
one version would give them a small bonus payment , but involved looking at an ‘ extremely bright colour ’ that they were told could potentially damage their eyes , while the other version involved looking at a harmless darker colour			0
the researchers found that participants who had been reminded of @entity3 before making their choice were more likely to opt for the dangerous version of the experiment – at 96 per cent – than those who had n’t been reminded of @entity3 , at 84 per cent			2
in another study , the researchers posted variations of three adverts online and recorded the click - through rates for each			0
some adverts promoted an immoral risk , such as ‘ learn how to bribe , ’ others promoted a non-moral risk , such as ‘ find skydiving near you ’ and another set promoted no risk , such as ‘ find amazing video games ’			2
previous studies have indicated religious people are less likely to gamble ( stock image ) or take drugs – seen as risky behaviours – but ms @entity39 and her colleagues noticed that the risks examined in these studies tended to share a negative moral component in some cases , the adverts included a mention of @entity3 – for example , ‘ @entity3 knows what you ’re missing ! find skydiving near you			1
’ the research revealed that when the adverts included a religious reference , people clicked on the non-moral risk of skydiving , more often			1
however , they clicked on the bribing - moral risk - less often			0
people clicked about the same number of times on the computer games advert , with or without a mention of @entity3			0
‘ we were surprised to find that even a simple colloquial expression - “ @entity3 knows what you ’re missing ” - influences whether people click on a real online ad that is promoting a risky behaviour , ’ ms @entity39 said			0
the study also indicated that people who were reminded of @entity3 perceived less danger in various risky behaviours than participants who were not reminded of @entity3			2
and they reported more negative feelings toward @entity3 when they lost their potential winnings in a risk - related game , suggesting that they had expected @entity3 to protect them from losing the money and were disappointed in the outcome			2
the researchers noted that this effect may apply to people from cultures in which @entity3 is not seen as a protective force .			0

study by @entity40 suggests people are willing to take risks because they believe @entity3 will protect them from harm
contradicts previous research that hinted religious people are risk averse
experiments found thinking about *god* makes people more likely to take risks , including non-moral ' dangers ' such as skydiving
but they were less interested in taking moral risks , like gambling
