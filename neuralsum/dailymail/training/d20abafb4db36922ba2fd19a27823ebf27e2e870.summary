by @entity1 reporter frustrated residents in a remote village finally have superfast broadband – after they dug trenches and laid new cables themselves			1
locals in @entity8 , @entity9 , had repeatedly asked internet provider @entity10 to wire them up to the new superfast cable , since it took them several minutes to load a single webpage			1
but @entity10 refused because of the village ’s remoteness and the cost			1
so volunteers laid new cables themselves to connect the village of around 50 homes to a superfast network , provided by independent firm @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
residents of @entity26 , @entity9 ( above ) , repeatedly asked internet provider @entity10 to wire them up to the new superfast cable but took the matter into their own hands when the internet provider refused to help they now have one of the fastest networks in the @entity33			1
@entity35 , of the @entity36 , it was ' life changing ' to the village			2
he said : ‘ it ’s no exaggeration to say that having hyper - speed broadband is a life - changing event			0
' previously , we were getting speeds of around one megabit meaning it could take six or seven hours to download a simple smartphone software update and minutes to load a webpage			0
' @entity1 activities that many people take for granted ... are only now a reality for residents in @entity8			0
’ volunteer @entity53 said it was tough but they managed to have fun while they were digging the trenches			0
she said : ' it 's been very , very hard especially in the winter when it was very muddy and you were up to your knees and trying to dig and you could n't get the mud off your spade			0
' @entity26 - two - and - a - half miles from the @entity66 - only boasts one pub , a village hall , two chapels , a garage , a tennis court and a bowling green			1
@entity36 was launched in 2011 when villagers realised they would be unlikely to see superfast broadband from the state - funded network , managed by @entity77 and provided by @entity10			2
residents in @entity8 , @entity9 now have one of the fastest networks in the @entity33 superfast broadband is defined by the @entity81 as broadband with speeds of @entity84 ( megabits per second ) or above			1
a survey conducted by insurance firm @entity86 in march suggested one in five rural families have poor broadband links and families said it was affecting their children 's education			0
the first homes , in the hamlet of @entity96 , @entity9 , were connected in 2012 and nearby @entity97 was next			1
raising its own funding without government help , @entity24 enlisted farmers and other local residents to dig its @entity102 ( fibre to the premises ) network , providing @entity107 broadband , plus phone and tv , to the most remote locations			0
by contrast , the @entity10 and council scheme can only deliver up to @entity114 within a kilometre of its central hub cabinets , and promises only a minimum of @entity118 in rural areas			2
a spokesman for @entity24 praised the locals for making the superfast broadband dream for their village happen			0
he added : ' the @entity124 was dedicated to completing this project , which means bringing the service to all those in @entity26 who want it			2

residents of @entity26 , @entity9 laid internet cables themselves
move came after @entity10 refused to because of village 's remoteness and cost
up to 50 homes in village now have one of the fastest networks in the @entity33
