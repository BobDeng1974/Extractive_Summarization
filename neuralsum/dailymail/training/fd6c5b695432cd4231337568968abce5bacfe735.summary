you might have seen @entity1 photobomb the moon and a comet get in a shot with the @entity6 spacecraft , but have you ever seen the red planet turn up in a picture of the blue one ? in an image of @entity10 taken from the moon our planet appears large and easily visible , but a much smaller speck of light reveals the fourth planet in the solar system - @entity18 - in the same shot			1
despite being 300 times further than our own planet , the planet can just about be spotted with a keen eye in one of the longest - distance photobombs ever			0
@entity27 - based @entity26 has released an image of @entity18 and @entity10 ( shown , @entity18 is in the red ring )			1
the picture was taken by the @entity31			0
this spacecraft in lunar orbit normally images the surface of the moon			1
but this time it was pointed towards @entity10 to capture the rare photo the image was taken by @entity26 ’s @entity31 on 24 may this year			1
usually the spacecraft is used to photograph the moon , but on this occasion it was pointed back at @entity10 to see our planet and @entity18 together			1
in the image @entity10 is about 234,062 miles ( 376,687 km ) from the spacecraft			2
@entity18 , meanwhile , is 70 million miles ( 112.5 million km ) away - 300 times further than @entity10			1
the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) entered lunar orbit in june 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface , probe the radiation environment , investigate water and key mineral resources , and gather geological clues about the moon 's evolution			1
the robotic mission set out to map the moon 's surface and , after a year of exploration , was extended with a unique set of science objectives			0
@entity31 observations have enabled numerous groundbreaking discoveries , creating a new picture of the moon as a dynamic and complex body			2
these developments have set up a scientific framework through which to challenge and improve our understanding of processes throughout the solar system			0
the image was taken by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , which is actually a set of two narrow - angle cameras ( @entity77 ) on the spacecraft			1
the images were built from rows of pixels taken by each of the cameras			0
however the cameras ca n't move by themselves and instead always point in the same direction			0
this means that they rely on the movement of the spacecraft to take a picture			0
to make @entity18 more visible a technique known as contrast stretching was used , making the planet more noticeable against the enormity of @entity10			2
‘ this view of @entity10 includes several cloud patterns that satellites observe frequently , ’ @entity26 writes on their site			2
' a line of rain and thunderstorms are visible in a band near the equator , an area known as the @entity105			0
' to the north , off the west coast of @entity107 , notice the banks of closed - cell clouds over the @entity111			0
' moving into the high latitudes , we see comma - shaped cloud patterns caused by extra-tropical cyclones			0
' in the image @entity10 is about 234,062 miles ( 376,687 km ) from the spacecraft			2
@entity18 , meanwhile , is 70 million miles ( 112.5 million kilometres ) away - 300 times further than @entity10			1
the images were built from rows of pixels taken by each of the cameras on @entity26 's @entity31 spacecraft the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , illustration shown , entered lunar orbit in june 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface , probe the radiation environment , investigate water and key mineral resources , and gather geological clues about the moon 's evolution in august skygazers were treated to a stunning photobomb of the moon by @entity1 , as the ringed planet peeked into view behind our natural satellite ( shown )			1
in @entity142 , the event could be seen with the naked eye as @entity1 disappeared behind the moon and reappeared on the other side			0

@entity27 - based @entity26 released an image of @entity18 and @entity10
the picture was taken by the @entity31
this spacecraft in lunar orbit normally images the surface of the moon
but this time it was pointed towards @entity10 to capture the rare photo
the chance *alignment* follows other ' *cosmic* photobombs ' this year
