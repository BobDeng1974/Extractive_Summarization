' i was shocked to hear there is to be an internal investigation only			1
this will be heard behind closed doors and the full findings would not be published			0
' this is n’t justice			0
justice needs to be seen to be done and the @entity15 has a moral and legal obligation to co-operate fully with any criminal investigation			2

meanwhile , @entity33 is understood to be living in a safe house in @entity78 and is not expected to set foot in @entity80 again			0
church insiders say he has been told by senior officials that he must now live as a shamed recluse after his dramatic statement on sunday night			1
the shockwaves from the admission by the 74 - year - old cleric that his ‘ sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected ’ also threatened to destabilise talks to select the new pope , which are getting under way in @entity95			2

we need , rather , to renew our faithfulness to @entity120 and to go about our business humbly			0
’ first minister @entity122 , who publicly backed @entity33 last week , has so far failed to comment on the cleric ’s downfall – but yesterday justice secretary @entity125 described it as a ‘ tragedy ’			2
@entity33 , who has not travelled to @entity95 to take part in the conclave convened to choose the new pope , was accused of sexual contact with young priests			2
most of the allegations , which he at first denied , dated back some 30 years			0

he is now staying at a secret address at a property which is not owned by the church			0
a source said : ‘ when told how he would need to live the rest of his life , he asked , “ am i to live like a hermit ? ” he was told that is exactly what it amounts to			2
’ insiders believe it is ‘ questionable ’ if the man dubbed the @entity138 because of his condemnation of gay marriage will ever return to @entity80			0
a @entity172 spokesman said officials expected the allegations against @entity33 to be investigated ‘ and a conclusion drawn ’			0
in his sermon at @entity104 ’s , archbishop @entity106 said it was a ‘ sad moment ’ for the @entity15 , adding : ‘ we will not forget for a long time , but we will heal and we will carry on ... as for the @entity15 ’s mission in our country , yes , our credibility and moral authority have been undermined			0
