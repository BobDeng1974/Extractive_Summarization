by @entity0 it ’s taken almost half a century to discover what creature made these tiny fossilised footprints , but researchers are now sure they were made by an ancient spider			1
the prints were uncovered during the 1960s in @entity8 by palaeontologist @entity9			2
following years of experiments and studies , experts now claim the prints were made by a 2.5 - inch long tarantula - sized arachnid , and date back approximately 260 million years			1
the footprints , pictured , were uncovered in @entity8 in 1968			2
they are on display at the @entity19 of @entity20 in @entity21 and experts believe the tracks date back 260 million years			1
they would have been made by a tarantula - sized creature said to have been approximately 2.5 - inches long in january , researchers from @entity26 discovered a rare spider fossil in @entity28 , after uncovering a similar fossil in the same region three years earlier			1
the original female fossil , found in the @entity32 of @entity33 in 2011 , was so well preserved experts claimed it was part of the @entity37 species			0
but the recent discovery of a similar - sized male fossil cast serious doubt over this theory because its relative size did n’t fit the @entity37 mould			2
in fact , the researchers were so baffled by the differences , they proposed a new genus called @entity49 , to describe the creature			0
it is thought the arachnids roamed the east 165 million years ago – almost a millennia after the spider who left the footprints in @entity8			1
the fossils are on display in the @entity59 at the @entity19 of @entity20 , named after the palaeontologist who made the discovery			1
@entity9 discovered the imprints in rock during an expedition to the deserts of @entity8 in 1968 , which include the @entity66 and parts of the @entity68			1
according to the museum , the moisture in the sand preserved the prints and as the sand dried in the sun , these prints became permanent			0
this sand eventually hardened into rock			0
after retrieving the fossils , @entity9 carried out a number of experiments which involved walking spiders and scorpions over inkpads and paper to mimic the shape and size of the prints			0
these tests were repeated by geologist @entity88 in 1993 and both experiments concluded the prints were made by a tarantula - sized spider			1

’ researchers have n't determined the exact type of spider which left the prints , but it 's believed to have been similar to modern - day tarantulas found in northern @entity8 , stock image pictured @entity9 museum curator @entity125 added the arachnid was likely to have been 2.5 - inches in length , and research suggests the fossils are 260 million - years - old			1

spider fossils are rare because their bodies are soft , but this pair was found in volcanic deposits and experts believe these deposits may have buried the pair at the bottom of a lake , perfectly preserving them			0
the fossils are roughly the size of the spider 's modern - day descendants , with a body one - inch long and more than half an inch wide , and legs that stretch to 2.5 inches			2

they are on display at the @entity19 in its @entity59
palaeontologists believe the tracks date back 260 million years
they were made by tarantula - sized creature approximately 2.5 - inches long
