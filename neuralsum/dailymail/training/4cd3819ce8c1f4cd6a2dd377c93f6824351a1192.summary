terrorists are taking out student loans and cheating the welfare system to bankroll jihad overseas , a senior police officer warned last night			1
@entity5 , of the @entity7 ’s counter-terrorism command , said charity scams were also being used to fund @entity10 fanatics in @entity11			1
‘ we are seeing diverse fraud including substantial fraud online , abuse of the benefits system , abuse of student loans , in order to fund terrorism , ’ she said			1
terrorists are also turning to online fraud and are using some forms of internet currency to transfer money abroad to fund jihadist groups , according to police ‘ we have had a number of cases in recent times where student loans have been abused to fund both crime and terrorism			1
‘ we have seen some cases where virtual currency is being considered and used by both criminals and terrorists			1
and so we are increasing our understanding of the abuse of those methods			2
’ the detective chief superintendent said women were increasingly being deployed to take the money overseas because they arouse less suspicion			1
‘ it is far better in many cases to use somebody who is not known to law enforcement , and females absolutely are used by both criminals and terrorists alike to move funds , ’ she said			2
she urged the public to be careful when donating to charities to ensure their money is not diverted by ‘ undesirable individuals ’			2
in the past 18 months , police in @entity57 have seized £ 2.5million of donations destined for criminal and terrorist gangs			0
miss @entity5 ’s intervention came amid continued fallout from the @entity63 ’s report into the @entity65 atrocity			0
his sister , @entity66 , said she ‘ blamed ’ @entity68 for the fact @entity70 failed to prevent his appalling murder at the hands of @entity74 and @entity75 at @entity76			0
as the @entity78 reported yesterday , the social networking site hosted ‘ graphic and emotive ’ messages by @entity74 in which he revealed his grotesque wish to ‘ kill a soldier ’			0
the new warning comes amid fallout from the report into the killing of @entity65 ( left ) after it emerged that @entity68 failed to report messages from @entity74 ( right ) about wanting to ' kill a soldier ' in ‘ substantial ’ online exchanges with an @entity91 extremist codenamed @entity92 , the @entity93 convert received advice on how to carry out an assault and was instructed to use a knife – one of the weapons used to hack @entity99 to death in may last year			2
but @entity68 did not alert @entity70 to the messages , which were not detected by its automated software and only emerged after the murder in may last year			0
it also failed to tell the security services it had already disabled seven of @entity74 ’s accounts – five for links to terrorism			0
the @entity63 report also criticised @entity70 and @entity110 for blunders made while tracking @entity74 and @entity75 .			0
