until now , @entity0 left at the scene of a crime only proves useful if it is already stored in a database and can be matched to a suspect			0
but a team of forensic experts have devised a way to recreate the face of a person , including eye and skin colour , using as little as 50 picograms ( 0.05 nanograms ) of extracted dna			1
called dna phenotyping , the tests also determine the person 's ancestry , if they have freckles and can be used to match with distant relatives			2
@entity0 phenotyping is the prediction of physical appearance from dna and is a technique being pioneered by @entity23 - based @entity22 ( example pictured )			1
the technology can be used to generate leads in cases where there are no suspects or database hits , or to help identify remains , for example @entity0 phenotyping is the prediction of physical appearance from dna and is a technique being pioneered by @entity23 - based @entity22			1
the technology can be used to generate leads in criminal cases where there are no suspects or database hits , or to help identify remains , for example			0
samples can be potentially taken from as little as a fingerprint			0
family history site @entity44 has extended its @entity47 service - a home testing kit that unlocks the secrets of a person ’s genetic ethnicity - to the @entity52			0
the results can be cross-checked with millions of family trees to help people discover unknown relatives			0
it uses microarray - based autosomal dna testing , which looks at person ’s entire genome at more than 700,000 locations using saliva			2
since it was released in 2012 , @entity47 has been used by around 700,000 people			0
all of these results have been stored on a secure , encrypted database , and each set of results is linked to a person ’s individual ancestry account and subsequent family tree			0
@entity47 can help people identify relationships with unknown relatives through a list of possible dna member matches			2
@entity78 's @entity77 system is said to be able to accurately predict genetic ancestry , eye colour , hair colour , skin colour , freckling , and face shape in individuals from any ethnic background			1
each prediction is presented with a ‘ measure of confidence ’			1
as an example , the test can say a person has green eyes with 61 per cent confidence , green or blue with 79 per cent confidence , and that they definitely do n’t have brown eyes , with 99 per cent confidence			2
based on ancestry , and other markers , the test also creates a likely facial shape			2
from all of this information , it builds a computer generated e-fit			1
and the test will predict how two people are related , as distant as third cousins , and great - great - great - great - grandparents			0
‘ dna carries the genetic instruction set for an individual 's physical characteristics , producing the wide range of appearances among people , ’ explained @entity22			1
‘ by determining how genetic information translates into physical appearance , it is possible to “ reverse - engineer " dna into a physical profile			1
‘ snapshot reads tens of thousands of genetic variants from a dna sample and uses this information to predict what an unknown person looks like			1
’ the project was supported with funding from the the @entity131 @entity130 ( @entity130 )			2
samples can be taken from as little as a fingerprint			0

a series of example charts is pictured @entity157 , @entity158 's director of bioinformatics told @entity159 that the system has been used in 10 cases across the @entity131 , and the first department to release a snapshot report was the @entity164			0
it produced a profile for a ‘ person of interest ’ in the murder of 25 - year - old @entity169 and her daughter @entity170 in 2011			1
the only piece of evidence left at the scene was an unspecified dna sample			0
investigators in @entity176 are hoping the @entity0 technique could lead to to a breakthrough in the unsolved murder case of @entity170 , three , ( left ) and her mother @entity169 ( right ) in 2011 there were no witnesses to the murder , so the local authorities turned to the forensic phenotyping and found the person was a male with dark - skinned , brown hair and brown eyes ( profile pictured ) there were no witnesses to the murder , so the local authorities turned to the forensic phenotyping and found the person was a male with dark - skinned , brown hair and brown eyes			1
@entity198 , a cold case investigator with the @entity200 police department , said that more than 200 people were interviewed in connection with the deaths			0
around 150 of them submitted their dna - but none matched the sample left at the scene .			0

@entity210 is the prediction of physical appearance from dna
the @entity77 system was designed by @entity22
it predicts , eye colour , hair colour , skin colour , freckling , and face shape
each prediction is presented with a ‘ measure of confidence ’
using all of this data , the system builds an e-fit of the owner of the dna
it has already been used as part of an unsolved murder case from 2011
