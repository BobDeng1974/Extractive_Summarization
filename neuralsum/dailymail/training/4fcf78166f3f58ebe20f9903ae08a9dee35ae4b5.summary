by @entity0 , @entity1 goalkeeper @entity2 insists finishing fourth would not have been his idea of success for @entity5 before the season started			1
the @entity7 signed off their final home @entity9 match with a 1 - 0 win over @entity12 , having already been secure in fourth place following @entity15 's defeat by @entity16 on saturday			2
it was a positive end to a campaign which a couple of months ago had been on the verge of implosion , and will end at @entity21 for the @entity23 final against @entity24 on may 17			1
despite that , @entity2 feels things could have been so different , and so much better			0
success ? @entity2 was part of @entity5 's lap of appreciation but says the season has been disappointing sign - off : @entity34 's header gave the gunners a 1 - 0 win to end the season at the @entity38 ' it is good to sign off with a win in front of our fans , but with two games to go we had nothing to play for and i think we should n't really be in that position - we should be fighting for the title , so that is disappointing , ' said @entity2			1
' i never considered fourth place before the start of the season as a successful season and a good position - i play for @entity5 because i want to win the title every year			1
' obviously at some point , when you lose games and you lose the chance to fight for the title , then the new challenge is to secure the @entity64 spot and that was the aim this season , but i would n't have taken it before the season			2
' after failing to keep pace with @entity68 , @entity16 and @entity69 - @entity5 suffered heavy away defeats against all of them - @entity72 's side slowly turned their form around			2
four straight league wins following the nerve - shredding @entity23 semi-final penalty shoot - out win over @entity77 saw the @entity7 overhaul @entity15 and give themselves another shot at elite @entity81 football once again next season			1
@entity2 feels confident @entity5 - who had to cope without key men like @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 for long spells because of injury - can regroup to last the distance in 2014 - 15			2
injury list : @entity2 said that injuries to the likes of @entity86 had cost @entity5 a shot at glory @entity98 @entity97 : @entity99 and @entity2 are competing for a place in @entity72 's @entity21 line - up ' it did n't happen for us this year , but one thing we have learned is that that we are good enough to challenge next year , and hopefully add a little bit more strength as well with a couple of new players coming in , ' the goalkeeper said			1
' if we manage to keep the consistency for the whole season , then we will be up there			0
' we have had a good run and the momentum is with us so we stay positive and hopefully finish with a trophy at the end of the season			2
' stand - in goalkeeper @entity99 was the @entity23 hero for @entity5 against @entity77 , saving two of the penalties			1
@entity2 believes his compatriot - who is out of contract in the summer - has earned the chance to play at @entity21 again			0
' i think @entity99 has done so well , that he deserves to play , but having said that i am a professional and i would love to play in the @entity23 final , ' @entity2 added			1
' it is the boss ' decision to make , not an easy one , because there is a number one at the club and a goalkeeper who is the reason we are in the @entity23 final			1
' another decision @entity72 has yet to confirm is whether he will be staying on next season himself , although the @entity5 manager moved to allay any fears his lap of appreciation would be the last time @entity7 fans saw him at the @entity38			1
wenger in : the gunners boss is yet to put pen to paper on a new contract but insists he will stay appreciation : @entity148 saluted the crowd amid rumours that he will leave the club this summer @entity2 said : ' it would be huge for us			0
' he is our manager and he has shown a lot of trust in a lot of the players at this club and we owe a lot to him			0
' the @entity12 appear set for another campaign in the top flight , as @entity163 's goalless draw at @entity69 left them three points clear with two matches still to play and holding a far superior goal difference			0
manager @entity171 will resolve his future at the end of the season , when it looks like his remit of keeping the midlands club up will have been met			0
in doubt : @entity171 has almost certainly kept @entity12 up , but is yet to seal his future at the club defender @entity177 believes there is plenty of character within the squad on which to build			0
' you have targets and ambitions , but without taking my ambitions down , i think any season where @entity12 stay up is an okay achievement , ' the @entity183 international said			0
' if you finish eighth you want to prosper and finish higher ( the next season ) , but there needs to be a balance between ambition and realism , so that is something to reflect on after this season			0

keeper claims injuries have cost the gunners , but maintains that fourth was not good enough
' i would n't have taken it before the season ' , says @entity5 number one
