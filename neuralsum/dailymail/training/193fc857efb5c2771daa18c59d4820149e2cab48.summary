the debate about climate change is distracting us from the true causes of flooding , a group of eminent scientists warned yesterday			1
concreting over flood plains , cutting down trees and expanding cities is making flooding much worse – and we need to act on that knowledge , they said			1
the exact link between global warming and flooding is much less certain , and those who keep pursuing the topic are taking attention away from the true problem of over-development , they said in a research paper			1
over-development : building on flood plains , cutting down trees and the expansion of cities are to blame for flooding , eminent scientists have claimed prime minister @entity29 , pictured left , claimed global warming was to blame for the floods but environment secretary @entity33 , pictured right , refused to endorse @entity29 's views @entity29 ignited a row at the height of the recent @entity38 floods by proclaiming that he ‘ very much ’ suspected the devastation had been caused by climate change			1
environment secretary @entity33 refused to endorse the prime minister ’s views and the @entity43 said there was no evidence that the winter floods had been caused by man - made global warming			1
the 19 scientists , from prestigious universities and institutes in @entity38 , the @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and across @entity54 , said that while greenhouse gas emissions are ‘ strongly linked ’ to flooding , there is insufficient evidence to accurately describe the connection			2
they said that until there is firm evidence about the role of climate change , it is better to concentrate on what we do know – that the way we are changing our physical landscape is making flooding worse			1
many of the authors , all respected climate change scientists , have contributed to @entity72 @entity74 reports			1
they include professor @entity76 , from @entity78 ’s department of meteorology , @entity80 , a @entity81 - based consultant who advises the @entity82 and @entity72			0
scientists claim there is no firm evidence to link climate change to flooding			1
much of the @entity38 was affected by floods in december , including @entity89 , @entity90 , after the @entity91 burst its banks and flooded homes and gardens worth millions the paper , published in the @entity96 yesterday , says : ‘ there is such a furore of concern about the linkage between greenhouse forcing [ the process by which man - made greenhouse gases are said to force climate change ] and floods that it causes society to lose focus on the things we already know for certain about floods and how to mitigate and adapt to them			1
‘ blaming climate change for flood losses makes flood losses a global issue that appears to be out of the control of regional or national institutions			2
' the scientific community needs to emphasize that the problem of flood losses is mostly about what we do on or to the landscape and that will be the case for decades to come			0
’ the authors say we know there is a clear link between population density and flooding			2
millions of houses and businesses have been built on flood plains , meaning that when rivers burst their banks the water flows onto roads and concrete , rather than bare earth			0
when it can not soak into the ground it causes untold damage			0
cutting down trees – which take up water – exacerbates the problem , as does changing the course of rivers for irrigation and to make way for more developments			0
but the authors say that when it comes to climate change they had only ‘ low confidence ’ in models that try to forecast the impact on flooding			2
different solution : scientists are calling for governments to look at the way changing physical landscapes is causing flooding , pictured near @entity165 in @entity166 ‘ the linkages between enhanced greenhouse forcing and flood phenomena are highly complex and it has not been possible to describe the connections well , either by empirical analysis or by the use of models , ’ they say			0
but they add : ‘ it is clear that current trends in human activity on the landscape continue to cause an increase in flood damages			0
‘ decreasing or reversing this trend will require substantial attention from governments , private citizens , scientists and engineers , and the actions needed to accomplish this are largely the same regardless of the nature of the greenhouse gas - flood linkage			0
’ @entity192 , policy director at the @entity193 , disagreed , warning that talking about climate change is vital to the debate			2
‘ four of the five wettest years on record in the @entity38 have all occurred since 2000 , with 2012 being the second wettest , and this winter shaping up to be the wettest ever , ’ he said			0
the row about spending on @entity38 ’s flood defences continued yesterday , when the @entity201 – the government ’s independent advisory body – said spending shortfalls could lead to £ 3billion in avoidable damage from a serious flood in future .			0

eminent scientists claim over-development is making flooding much worse
they say the link between global warming and flooding is less certain
it comes after @entity29 claimed climate change had caused the recent floods in the @entity38
