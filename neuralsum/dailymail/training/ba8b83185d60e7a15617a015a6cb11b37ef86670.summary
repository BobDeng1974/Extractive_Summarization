as the owner of a food shop , @entity0 was constantly surrounded by temptation - and saw her weight balloon to 27 stone 7lb			1
the 43 - year - old , from @entity7 , @entity8 , spent years overeating and snacking on the treats that she sells at her upmarket delicatessen , resulting in the pounds piling on			1
however , the final straw came in 2013 when @entity0 realised her size 30 frame would not fit into a plane seat , and she changed her eating habits - and lost half her body weight in just 18 months			1
@entity0 endured six torturous months of not eating any traditional food , only protein - heavy meal replacement products			1
she then introduced a small evening meal for six months - all while resisting the tasty food on sale in her deli			0
within a year @entity0 dropped 13st 1lb and lost a staggering 20.5ins off her waist and 27ins off her hips			1
@entity0 was a size 30 , right , and was firmly in the morbidly obese			1
@entity0 endured a strict diet and dropped 13st 1lb and lost 20.5in off her waist , left , as a result @entity0 endured six torturous months of not eating any traditional food , only protein - heavy meal replacement products and never once did a sweet treat from her deli pass her lips she 's now shed more than half her body weight and plummeted 18 dress sizes to a size 12 - 14 and tips the scales at 12st 6lb mother - of - two @entity0 , pictured at her heaviest , had been overweight since childhood , which she attributed to emotionally - motivated binge eating she 's now shed more than half her body weight and plummeted 18 dress sizes to a size 12 - 14 and tips the scales at 12st 6lb			1
the weight loss has been so dramatic that people no longer recognise her - especially customers coming into her @entity68 shop in @entity7			2
she said : ' about six months ago one elderly customer asked me very sternly " what happened to that other very stout girl that used to work here ? " ' i replied with a very big smile : " that ’s me ma’am ! "			0
" well i never , " she replied whilst reeling backwards ! ' mother - of - two @entity0 had been overweight since childhood , which she attributed to emotionally - motivated binge eating			1
' looking back , food has been my crutch and my drug of choice for my entire life and i had reached an enormous weight , ' she said			2
' never have i wanted to be fat , even at my darkest points and my deepest binges			0
' i hated the way food controlled me and dictated my life , from the clothes i wore to how i felt about myself			0
i felt useless and pathetic and a complete failure			0
' at the beginning of 2013 , her doctor recommended fitting a gastric band after her @entity98 hit 60 - twice the obese level of 30			2
but she says the produce in her shop was easier to resist once she decided to shed the pounds			0
' following a diet plan made it easier for me to work in the deli - because i could n’t make any decisions about what i was eating , ' she said			2
' before that , it was lethal			0
it was just too easy to have a snack in the deli			0
i did not once - in one year - have one thing i was n’t meant to have			1
i did n’t put a piece of ham off the slicer into my mouth , i did n’t take a biscuit out of the jar			0
' the weight loss has been so dramatic people have stopped recognising her , even customers from her deli now she is off her strict plan , @entity0 has a light breakfast of half a grapefruit and a piece of toast , a @entity33 product for lunch and whatever the family is having for dinner			1
but @entity0 does not feel the battle with her weight is over			2
' i feel scared that i will go back there one day , ' she said			0
but i am incredibly grateful that i found tools to fix a problem i made			0
i am slimmer , healthier and happier with myself than i have been in over 25 years			0
' @entity0 on the last day of her diet with @entity140 , an independent @entity33 consultant @entity0 was a size 30 and was firmly in the morbidly obese category according to her @entity98 score of 60 - double the obese level of 3 first 12 weeks food replacement products : porridge for @entity147 , @entity148 at noon , @entity149 at 6pm , @entity148 around 9pm next 12 weeks @entity150 , @entity149 at noon , shake at 6pm , bar around 9pm @entity153 6 months porridge for @entity147 , @entity156 food for supper ( from a specific list of allowable protein and vegetables along with weights ) , bar around 9pm .			1
