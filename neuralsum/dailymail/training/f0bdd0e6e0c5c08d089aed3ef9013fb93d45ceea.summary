by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 9 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:02 est , 9 february 2014 a church clock maintained by a devoted doctor for almost thirty years stopped at the very same moment he passed away			1
dr @entity6 climbed the narrow stone spiraled stairs of the @entity10 clock tower in @entity11 , @entity12 , every week for three decades			1
he died at his home aged 92 surrounded by family on @entity15			0
the clock on the tower of @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , stopped at the very moment , 8.15am , dr @entity6 ( pictured with his wife @entity19 , right ) passed away the doctor had maintained the clock - winding and cleaning it - every week for thirty years dr @entity6 , pictured , emigrated from @entity23 in the 1950s after he inherited the @entity25 estate - located close to the church the man 's son , also dr @entity6 , glanced at his watch as his father slipped away - and later realised the church clock also stopped at the exact same time			1
dr @entity6 said : ' the clock stopped literally to the minute of dad 's death			1
as a family doctor i 'm used to looking at my watch because sometimes it can be critical for the death certificate			0
the doctor , pictured as a young man , continued working as a medic until he was 70 ' it was just habit that i did it as we knew he was going to die			0
he was having palliative treatment , but i realised he had stopped breathing and i read the time on my watch as 8.15am			2
' it was only later when i spoke to two different people in the village that we realised the clock had stopped at the same time			2
' dr @entity6 's death came just a few weeks after the 60th anniversary of his arrival in the village to take over the 10,000 - acre @entity25 family estate , which he had inherited			1
although @entity10 is not part of the estate , it was rebuilt around 150 years ago using the @entity6 's family money			1
' something strange was certainly going on , ' said dr @entity6			1
' but it 's quite a nice touch when we think of all the time my father devoted to it			0
' he had maintained it for 30 years but it eventually became too much for him and he reluctantly had to hand over the responsibility			2
' it 's the focus of the village and because the village is small enough to hear the clock chime it 's a real time keeper			0
it was very close to my dad 's heart			0
' the clock was restarted following dr @entity6 's funeral , where he was remembered for his dedication for the village as well as his medical career			1
dr @entity6 with his wife , @entity19 and children @entity89 and @entity91 leaving @entity23 in 1953 the late doctor 's son , dr @entity6 pictured , said the clock stopping was ' a nice touch ' as his father was so dedicated to it born in @entity99 , @entity23 in 1921 , his family later moved to @entity100 and he was educated at @entity101 , one of @entity23 's oldest public schools			1
later he went to medical school and trained as a doctor			0
while at the @entity106 in @entity100 , he met @entity19 , an operating theatre nurse and they were married in 1947			0
in the early 50s , a telegram arrived to say that his uncle @entity109 had died in @entity110 and the doctor was faced with the choice of taking over the @entity12 estate that had been in the family since the 1700s			2
he and his family took up residence in november 1953 where he worked until he retired			0
the doctor became ill in november 2013 and after a period in hospital , returned to his home of 60 years when it became clear that he was not going to recover			0
there will be a celebration of dr @entity125 's life at @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity126 on february 18 , at 2pm .			2

dr @entity6 maintained @entity129 clock in @entity11 , @entity12 for 30 years
would climb the stairs of @entity10 every week to wind clock
died last month and clock stopped at 8.15am - the moment he passed
