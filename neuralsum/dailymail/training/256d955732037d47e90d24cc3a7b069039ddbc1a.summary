by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 05:23 est , 7 may 2013 the @entity1 last night bowed to pressure to launch an inquiry into presenter @entity4 ’s reign of child abuse			1
former staff said @entity4 ’s sick behaviour was well known at the corporation , but until now the @entity1 had resisted a new inquiry			1
only on sunday , @entity11 chairman @entity10 ruled one out , dismissing calls from victims and mps by saying it ‘ would probably delay arriving at the truth ’			1
u-turn : the @entity1 has announced it will launch a formal inquiry into presenter @entity4 , pictured outside @entity20 he said the existing dame @entity23 review into the @entity25 crisis would be widened to examine @entity4 ’s two decades of abuse			1
but within 24 hours the corporation performed a dramatic u-turn by announcing a new ‘ freestanding investigation ’			0
a spokesman said : ‘ in light of a potential conflict of interest with dame @entity23 there will be a freestanding investigation covering @entity4 ’s conduct at the @entity1 which will feed into her review			1
‘ this work will be led by a different individual appointed by the @entity1			2
’ the ‘ different individual ’ who will lead the inquiry was not named , leading to speculation the corporation has yet to find a suitable person willing to take on the task			0
the potential conflict of interest has arisen because @entity49 knows @entity50 , who worked with @entity4 at the @entity1 in @entity51			1
@entity10 told the @entity52 that a review in to the @entity25 scandal would also include questions over how @entity4 was able to abuse his victims @entity4 abused children as young as nine			1
he invited teenagers desperate for fame to his @entity1 dressing room and molested them , and also groped girls in a sick bay on @entity1 premises			2
some of the dressing - room attacks were allegedly videoed by a floor manager known as ‘ @entity67 ’			0
@entity10 said it was clear there were people who had been willing to ‘ turn a blind eye ’ to the ‘ thoroughly unpleasant ’ behaviour of the it ’s a @entity74 presenter			2
and he said the @entity1 would be liable to pay compensation to his victims			2
@entity4 has pleaded guilty to assaulting 13 girls between 1967 and 1986			0
he faces a jail sentence and was described as an ‘ opportunistic predator ’ after he appeared at @entity20 last thursday			0
in striking parallels to @entity81 , @entity1 managers were afraid to intervene because he was such a successful star			0
the @entity1 denies its change of plan is a @entity85 turn golden boy : @entity4 pictured while working as a presenter for the @entity89 news programme @entity4 was awarded an obe for his services to broadcasting and charity last year however , unlike with @entity25 – who died in 2012 – @entity4 , 83 , is still alive and may yet face further sex abuse charges			1
police have confirmed they are investigating claims made by more women who have come forward			0
a @entity1 source said its inquiry would need to be careful not to interfere with any new police investigations			2
@entity25 's time at the @entity1 is being reviewed by @entity23 it is understood corporation executives are in talks with senior officers to avoid a potential clash			1
the @entity1 move will be welcomed by victims ’ groups			0
the @entity109 for people abused in @entity112 charity has said the @entity1 ‘ gave @entity4 unfettered opportunities to carry out his abuse ’ , and it owed victims answers			1
a former colleague of @entity4 ’s , @entity118 , said @entity1 bosses must have known about his behaviour because he was ‘ unable to talk to a woman without touching her ’			1
mp @entity122 said : ‘ once again the @entity11 and @entity10 look slow and reluctant to act			1
only yesterday he said no new investigation , today it has changed			0
‘ i had hoped something would have been learned from the @entity81 debacle			0
‘ the important thing now is that we find out who knew about @entity4 and when they knew it			0
was his behaviour reported internally and if so what action was taken ? what exactly went wrong ? ’ last night another @entity1 spokesman stressed : ‘ this is not a u-turn			0
it is not a separate inquiry			0
it is just an extension of the @entity23 inquiry			2
‘ i know it sounds like we are dancing on the head of a pin , but it is a freestanding inquiry that will be fed into the @entity23 review			1
’ presenter : @entity4 , pictured in 1968 , has pleaded guilty to assaulting 13 girls between 1967 and 1986			0

@entity10 , @entity11 chairman , yesterday dismissed calls for an inquiry
he said @entity1 would look into @entity4 's reign of abuse as part of the @entity23 review into the @entity25 scandal
but @entity156 today confirmed it will hold a formal inquiry into @entity4
