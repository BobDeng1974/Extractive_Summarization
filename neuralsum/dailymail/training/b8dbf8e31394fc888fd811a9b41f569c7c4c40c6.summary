former @entity1 governor @entity0 says his views about @entity4 's place in the world will often be compared with those of his father and brother , but insists , ' i am my own man			1
' the likely @entity12 candidate for president , in remarks wednesday to the @entity15 , said he is ' lucky ' to have family members who have ' shaped @entity4 's foreign policy from the @entity18			1
' ' i recognize that as a result , my views will often be held up in comparison to theirs ' – sometimes in contrast to theirs , ' @entity0 said			2
in the course of answering questions from the audience , he admitted that 2002 pre-war intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in @entity29 was wrong , seeming to part with his brother president @entity31 on his justification for sending @entity4 's military in full - bore			1
' there were mistakes made in @entity29 , for sure , ' he said			1
@entity0 took questions after speaking to the @entity15 on wednesday in @entity39 in his brother 's shadow : @entity0 , right , said he loves his older brother @entity31 , center , ' but i am my own man ' but he also praised his brother for an act of political ' courage ' for later authorizing a troop surge in @entity29 to stabilize the country , something few in the federal government at the time thought was wise			1
that move , he claimed , was ' hugely successful			2
' ' i am my own man – and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences , ' he insisted			0
' each president learns from those who came before – their principles , their adjustments			0
' while @entity0 has not yet formally declared his candidacy , he is all but certain to run for president in 2016 and has already faced questions about how he would distinguish himself from his family , particularly his older brother , former president @entity31			1
the older @entity0 brother finished his second term in 2009 amid an unpopular war in @entity29 , an economy in freefall and with a majority of @entity4 disapproving of his job performance			1
among donors , @entity0 has noted a strong family and religious bond with his older brother , but has also said they are not clones and have differences common among siblings			1
some foreign policy experts say @entity0 must go farther			0
@entity83 , a former national security adviser to @entity31 , said that includes taking a stance on whether @entity31 's decision to invade @entity29 in 2003 was appropriate			1
@entity0 did not answer that question directly when asked about it last week after an event in @entity1 for his mother 's literacy charity			1
' the answer he gave last week , about not litigating the past , that 's not a satisfying answer , ' @entity83 said			1
' he has to come up with a better answer than that			0
' he seemed to go there on wednesday			2
@entity83 said @entity0 , should he win election , would inherit an international landscape far different from the one his brother left behind			2
instead of the lurking threat of @entity103 , @entity0 would take on a map dotted with violent and unstable spots that include @entity106 , @entity29 and @entity107			1
' the @entity4 has an undiminished ability to shape events and build alliances of free people , ' he said			0
' we can project power and enforce peaceful stability in far - off areas of the globe			0
' man of the people ? @entity0 is trying to distinguish himself from his more famous relatives the former governor insisted on wednesday that the @entity123 administration 's policies on @entity124 and the @entity126 terror army are wrong - headed @entity0 aides also released what they called a preliminary group of experts who would provide him advice			1
they included familiar names , such as @entity133 and @entity134 , both secretaries of @entity136 under president @entity137 ; former @entity138 secretaries @entity139 and @entity140 , and former deputy secretary of defense @entity141 , all three of whom served under @entity31			1
the list also included some lesser - known names , such as @entity144 , a former national security adviser to @entity31 , who now teaches at @entity145 and is seen as key to @entity0 's idea of lessening @entity4 dependence on @entity150 energy			2
@entity0 has harsh words for the foreign policy of president @entity123 , whose administration is ' inconsistent and indecisive ' and has led the @entity4 to lose ' the trust and the confidence of our friends			0
' ' the great irony of the @entity123 presidency is this : someone who came to office promising greater engagement with the world has left @entity4 less influential in the world , ' @entity0 said			0
and he spelled out a need for @entity4 to respond to the threat of the @entity126 terror army with a strategy that ' takes them out			0
' ' there 's no talking about this			0
that 's just not going to work for terrorism , ' he said			0
@entity0 insisted that the @entity123 administration 's approach to @entity124 was wrongheaded , and blasted the @entity178 for conducting secret negotiations that will give the @entity181 regime access to @entity4 tourism dollars and open markets			2
' we got nothing in return , ' he said			0
' i would n't call what we did a reset			2
i would call it bad negotiations			0
' @entity0 aides also confirmed late tuesday that former @entity194 congressman @entity193 , a senior policy aide to 2012 @entity12 presidential nominee @entity195 , was advising @entity0 .			0

former @entity1 governor still has n't addressed the question of whether or not @entity31 made the right decision in starting a war in @entity29
he would be the third person in his family to live in the @entity178 if the 2016 race goes his way
last week he hedged on the question , saying he did n't want to ' litigate the past '
but wednesday he *agreed* that 2002 pre-war intelligence about weapons of mass destruction was wrong
he also praised his brother for implementing a troop ' surge ' after in the war , when few in the federal government supported it
