@entity1 's rich history , stunning landscapes and events such as golf 's @entity4 are luring over two million holidaymakers a year , but what will happen to the country 's lucrative tourism industry if it splits from the @entity10 ? with rising anticipation over the @entity1 referendum on thursday , a number of industry analysts and tourism chiefs are trying to predict what a @entity17 vote could mean for visitors and for @entity1 who travel abroad			1
experts ' biggest concerns relate to the potential impact on border controls , visa requirements and currency exchange rates if @entity1 decides to go it alone			1
visit @entity1 , the country 's official tourism board , said the industry is worth £ 11bn and showing faster growth than the country 's manufacturing , retail and transport industries			1
but observers are offering conflicting views over whether that growth will accelerate or slow down in an independent @entity1			1
border controls crossing the border is not expected to be a hassle if @entity1 votes to separate			1
because the @entity10 is part of an agreed @entity50 , @entity1 is likely to remain part of it			2
that means travel between the @entity10 and @entity1 would have minimal border control and people travelling to and from @entity1 may not necessarily need their passport , according to insurance provider @entity58			1
money on the mind : @entity1 's tourism industry will suffer if it can not continue using @entity62 , says one analyst a recent survey by @entity65 suggests most visitors do not care if @entity1 is independent or not			1
of more than 700 international and local visitors to the @entity10 in august , 84 per cent said their decision to visit @entity1 would be unaffected by the referendum results			1
but @entity71 respondents were twice as likely as international visitors to feel less inclined to visit			0
@entity73 , managing director of @entity74 , said : ' it is likely that @entity1 's tourism industry will suffer if it can not continue using @entity62 , as this factor will likely act as a barrier among inbound visitors ' decision			1
' @entity1 holidaymakers may face a reduction in availability of insurance , says @entity58 travel blogger @entity84 , who writes for the @entity87 website , is n't convinced that crossing the border will be a smooth experience in an independent @entity1			2
@entity84 wrote : ' border controls on the border with @entity1 could make a @entity10 holiday as stressful as heading abroad			1
' what exactly an independent @entity1 might mean for holidaymakers is yet to be seen and of course it does all depend on a @entity17 vote , but it could mean the need to change money to a @entity1 currency in the same way you need to when you go abroad			2
' it could mean passport control for those entering and leaving the country , and in time should the @entity1 economy not be able to support its @entity107 that you may even need travel insurance to cover injury while you 're away			0
' what will happen ? there are concerns about border controls , visa requirements and currency exchange rates @entity117 , an expert in event tourism in @entity119 , believes tourism to @entity1 will boom if independence wins the vote			1
he told travel news and data agency @entity125 : ' in the short term , tourism will dramatically increase in @entity1 following independence due to the enthusiasm and interest in @entity1 ancestry and culture			2
' in the long term , tourism will grow even stronger due to easier and better visa regulations being put in place that will welcome more tourists to @entity1 and encourage them to extend their stay to explore different parts of its beautiful land			1
' the @entity138 claims independence will lead to lower tourism taxes , meaning cheaper holidays , more visitors and a boost for the @entity1 economy			2
but those in the no campaign say independence would hamper tourist flows and @entity1 would lose its profile of being a member of the @entity10			0
a recent survey by @entity65 suggests most visitors to the @entity10 do not care if @entity1 is independent or not travel insurance @entity1 holidaymakers may face a reduction in availability when choosing insurance because many @entity10 - based insurers are only able to insure @entity10 residents , meaning @entity1 may either not be eligible for cover or will be directed to a specialist provider for their insurance			0
there has been speculation that @entity1 independence may result in a change of currency to the @entity168 , meaning that @entity10 insurers with license to sell insurance in @entity1 may only be able to accept payments and offer settlements in @entity62			2
however , @entity1 independence may lead to a rise in the number of @entity1 - based insurers			0
@entity176 of @entity58 said : ' if the polls are to be believed , the results on thursday will be extremely close and a vote for independence could have a direct impact on travellers on both sides of the border			0
' in the short - term , a @entity17 vote will disrupt the insurance markets , with both choice and price affected , but my view is that it will inevitably stabilise over time			0
' the insurance industry is a mature market and adept to change and therefore will evolve to meet the needs of residents , whatever the outcome			0
' big business : @entity1 's tourism industry attracted over 2.5 million overseas visitors last year health while @entity1 is likely to keep its @entity107 , it will operate as a separate and independent @entity1 nhs , meaning unless a reciprocal agreement is made between the @entity10 and @entity1 , anyone travelling between the two countries may have to pay for any medical care they receive			1
if this does change , travel insurers are likely to charge higher premiums			0
the premiums would be similar to those that they charge for @entity213 travel , with some providers potentially charging their customers double for cover			0
crossing the border may not be that much of a hassle if @entity1 votes to separate national airline and air travel and then there is the question of whether an independent @entity1 should create a national airline			2
faced with the possibility of a new competitor , several aviation bosses told the @entity228 that @entity1 should n't bother			0
@entity229 , chief executive of @entity230 , said : ' do n't do it			0
' professor @entity231 from @entity232 , who has written an analysis on what he believes could happen if @entity1 separates , said : ' there is also a good deal of anxiety about the implications , for @entity239 in particular , of an independent @entity1 government committing itself to an immediate 50 per cent reduction in @entity242			0
' there are also fears that cross-border businesses would suffer from any variation in exchange rates and from the potential administrative costs of dealing with two different currencies			0

@entity1 's lucrative tourism industry employs around 200,000 people
visit @entity1 says industry is worth £ 11bn and showing *incredible* growth
biggest concerns relate to border controls , visa requirements , currency
