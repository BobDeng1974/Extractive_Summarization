thousands of migrants are exploiting lax @entity2 rules to bring their families and spouses to @entity5 by the back door			1
foreign nationals from outside @entity8 who would be unlikely to gain a visa to live or work in the @entity5 are instead applying for citizenship elsewhere in the @entity2			1
under @entity12 rules , they can then move to @entity5 and apply for permission to bring in their spouse or children			2
' growing problem ' : chief inspector of @entity19 and @entity20 has warned that @entity21 were using @entity12 ' free movement rules to get into the @entity5 now a damning report by an immigration watchdog has found that the system is suffering ‘ significant abuse ’ at the hands of migrants who falsely claim they are related or married to a @entity30 living in the @entity5			1
yesterday , chief inspector of @entity19 and @entity20 called it a ‘ growing problem ’			1
he said : ‘ our findings suggest the @entity36 citizenship route is becoming an increasingly important way into the @entity5 for those whose origins lie outside the @entity40 [ @entity40 ] , particularly now that the immigration rules have been tightened			1
’ the report looked at more than 100 sample cases from the @entity44 between april and september last year			2
it found that more than a third of @entity36 nationals – 36 per cent – who were applying for citizenship for their partner were born in @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53 and had gained @entity36 citizenship before arriving in @entity5			1
@entity55 vowed to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year , but is failing because of the soaring number of @entity8 moving to the @entity5 in a quarter of cases the ‘ sponsors ’ – whose new nationalities included @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 – were born in the same @entity60 country as their partner			1
in one case , a migrant who acquired @entity66 nationality before then moving to the @entity5 received 97 per cent of his income from welfare handouts			2
some 60 per cent of those applying for citizenship for a so - called spouse last year failed because immigration officials feared the relationship was fake – but thousands still slip through the net			1
some had taken part in a sham marriage while in the @entity5 and others claimed they had been wed by proxy , where a couple remain in @entity5 and both are represented at an overseas wedding ceremony , usually by family members			2
most proxy marriages were found to be invalid , according to the report			0
it found that there is also a problem with @entity93 women moving to the @entity5 and applying for citizenship for men they had supposedly married , mainly from @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			2
mr @entity20 said there had been ‘ significant attempted abuse by @entity102 nationals applying on the basis of marriage or civil partnership with a @entity36 citizen ’			0
he added : ‘ if the @entity44 does not act decisively to identify and tackle these abuses , many of the individuals involved may go on to obtain settlement in the @entity5 on the basis of relationships that are not genuine			0
’ inspectors found that in some cases where there was suspicion of a sham marriage , the culprits were not properly investigated			0
the report added that the @entity44 targeted sham marriage and trafficking by organised crime gangs , but prosecuted fewer individuals			0
@entity123 chairman @entity122 said : ‘ i am deeply concerned by these findings			0
it is vital that all applications for admission to this country are subjected to appropriate levels of scrutiny			0
we have seen during the passport crisis that standards of scrutiny for applications should never be lowered			0
’ @entity137 immigration minister @entity136 said : ‘ it is clear that after four years in office @entity139 may just has n’t got a grip on sham marriages			0
’ a @entity44 spokesman said : ‘ we are taking ever tougher action to crack down on those who try to cheat our immigration system by abusing marriage laws and we are pleased the chief inspector has praised our robust approach to identifying sham marriages			1
last year , we intervened in more than 1,300 sham marriages – more than double that of the previous year			0
