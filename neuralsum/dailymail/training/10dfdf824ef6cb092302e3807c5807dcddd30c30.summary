the once squeaky clean boy band have spent almost as much time in tattoo parlours as they have on stage in recent years			1
with the sole exception of @entity6 , @entity4 have devoted hours to getting themselves inked from head to toe since hitting 18			2
the first to hit the ink was @entity10 , who had an outline of a star tattooed on his inner bicep as soon as he reached 18 - and his band mates were quick to follow suit			1
however , speaking in an interview with @entity33 , the boys opened up about the meaning of a few of their tattoos - some of it proving quite unexpected			1
interviewed backstage during the @entity37 leg of their world tour , @entity10 , who famously got nine tattoos in just 10 months , revealed that he takes inspiration from the people he meets			1
' we get to meet a lot cool people and they say stuff that sticks , ' said the teen heartthrob			1
' some tattoos are just reminders of friends i 've made - whether it be lifelong friends or those i 've made in the past four years			1
' it 's nice to have people impact you in different ways			1
' fan : @entity10 famously returned to the tattoo parlour nine times in just 10 months people power : @entity10 says he is inspired by the ' cool people ' he meets as he travels the world not all of the boys think so deeply about their body art , however , with @entity19 admitting that several of his came about simply because he ' likes the look of them '			1
' to be honest , not many of them actually have any meaning , ' he explained			2
' i just like to look at them			0
' i started with a silly stick man			0
and then i like skateboarding , so that 's why i got that one			0
this is for the world tour			0
this " oops " is because i did n't like this line here , so i was like , " oops ! " ' although @entity20 and @entity10 were both quick off the mark , @entity19 gives both a run for their money in the tattoo stakes and also boasts a spider 's web and a bomb ( ' because i 'm da bomb ' ) on his forearm			1
ink : @entity20 has an entire sleeve of tattoos on his right arm , many of which he has helped to design himself superheroes : @entity20 says the @entity97 ! tattoo relates to his childhood passion for comic books @entity20 revealed that his famous ' @entity97 ! ' tattoo came about because of a childhood fascination with superheroes			1
' i 'm a bit of a geek when it comes to comic books , ' said the star			0
' i 've always had a bit of fascination with cartoons and comics			0
' the news may come as a surprise to dedicated @entity4 , as the 21 - year - old has previously claimed that the tattoo had an alternative meaning			2
in an interview with @entity119 in 2012 , @entity20 insisted that the ' @entity97 ! ' tattoo referred to his own secret society called ' @entity122 ' in which he and @entity19 are captains			1
no reason : louis says that there is no meaning behind his tattoos and he just likes to look at them unusual : @entity19 ' earlier tattoos ( left ) were more basic than his famous bird on his forearm naughty : @entity19 caused controversy when he had the name of his old band @entity136 tattooed on his shins prior to making his bizarre claims public , many had thought that the comic book style tattoo was an acronym for ' @entity20 and @entity27			1
' whatever the real meaning of ' @entity97 ! ' , the star has plenty more inkings to decode , among them a small black script on his collarbone			1
taking to @entity147 after having it done in 2012 , he tweeted : ' for every1 asking what the new tatt means it says be true to who you are '			0
the performer also has his grandfather 's name on his chest in @entity159 as well as a @entity161 symbol on his hip which means ' born lucky ' , while the yin and yang symbol is to be found on his wrist			0
not impressed : @entity21 's mother reportedly loathes his tattoos with the exception of the feather tribute : the feather is a reference to his grandmother while the words beneath are a @entity4 song lyric unmarked : @entity6 remains the only member of one direction to successfully resist the lure of ink the final tattoo fan in one direction is @entity30 , whose most recent inking paid tribute to his band and involved having the lyrics ' i figured it out ' from the song you and i added to his feather etching			1
the 21 - year - old says his feather is especially meaningful to him - and even managed to impress his mother - because it refers to his deceased grandmother			0
' my mum hates tattoos but she likes this one , because this one is specifically to do with my nan			2
that was actually the one that turned her around to tattoos and she was ok with it			2
' ' the feather was a thing , when i was a kid we used to find feathers around the house and whenever we found them my mum used to say it was my nan leaving them around for us to find , so that was quite sweet			0
' @entity21 's other tattoos include the words ' everything i wanted but nothing i 'll ever need ' on his left forearm			2
he also has ' @entity221 ' on his right wrist and four chevrons on his right forearm			0
of his ankle tattoos , he says : ' these are the first tattoos i ever got			2
all of us apart from @entity6 have got these on are ankles			0
' they 're just crosses , the screws which keep you together			0
i suppose it 's a keep you ground thing			0
keep your feet on the ground			0

one direction have come clean about the meanings of their many tattoos
@entity20 claims that the reason for his ' @entity97 ! ' tattoo is simpler than imagined
louis says that there is very little thought behind any of his etchings
@entity10 says he takes inspiration from ' cool people ' he meets
