victims of the 2011 attacks , which the government called a hate crime and an attempt by a splinter group to shame members who left or denounced it , say justice is needed , especially for the ringleader			1
in a rare interview last week in @entity44 at the community 's sprawling farm amid rolling hills in eastern @entity12 , unmarried 19 - year - old @entity36 , grandson of ring leader @entity69 , said he is anticipating a life of mentoring @entity3 children and sharing in child - rearing if the parents go to prison			1
while he spoke , a 15 - year - old boy used a chain saw to cut fence planks and a 12 - year - old crisply drove nails into the planks as a 10 - year - old held up the board			0
the youngest trudged in boots through ankle - deep mud and a creek surging with melting snow			0
prison terms will make the whole operation harder to maintain , @entity36 said			0
left behind : @entity3 girls look out the windows of the home of @entity69 , in @entity44 , @entity12 - he faces a life sentence for orchestrating beard - cutting attacks isolation : the @entity3 community shuns the outside world and lives off the land in rural @entity12 ' it will be a mess , ' he added shaking his head under a wide - brim hat			1
the accused ringleader @entity69 broke away from the mainstream amish in 1995 , seeking stricter cultural rules and @entity108 interpretation than is the norm in the eastern @entity12 community , authorities have said			1
he was the undisputed leader of his group , counseling relatives on religious matters , negotiating drilling rights on his land and denouncing @entity3 who questioned his authority			2
@entity69 's community , like many @entity3 groups , grew through marriage and the purchase of farmland to sustain extended families that work and pray together , mostly shut off from outside influences like electricity , autos and electronics			1
amish communities have a highly insular , modest lifestyle , are deeply religious and believe in following the @entity132 , which they believe instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry			1
contact with the modern world is limited , and glimpses from the news media inside @entity3 communities even rarer			2
fending for themselves : a pair of young @entity3 boys play in a sandbox in front of the home of @entity149 the community has been torn apart by the scandal and highly - publicized court case traditions : an @entity3 buggy is driven down the road between the farms in @entity44 where a tight - knit community live by strict religious rules the five beard - and hair - cutting attacks followed years of animosity , traced in part to a nasty custody battle involving @entity69 's daughter and his strict demands on religious observance			1
the custody dispute led to a contentious history with local law enforcement over the county 's seizure of two @entity69 granddaughters from their mother			2
one of @entity69 's daughters - in - law and a former brother - in - law told investigators that he allowed others to beat members who disobeyed him , according to an affidavit			2
he punished some by making them sleep in a chicken coop for days and was sexually intimate with married women to ' cleanse them of the devil , ' the two relatives said in the affidavit			0
@entity69 's defense argued there was no proof of such sexual conduct			2
his community had contact with other @entity3 groups , often because of family ties throughout the region or when gathering at livestock auctions or to buy farming equipment			1
some @entity3 spoke out against his authoritarian style , and the government said that led to the attacks as @entity69 tried to discipline dissenters who left his community and @entity3 bishops who condemned him			1
taking charge : younger members of the @entity3 community are being forced to put children to work to keep up with the labor at farms since 16 adults have been put on trial marching on : the @entity3 community has fascinated the outside world with its shunning of electricity , cars , electronics and the media @entity217 , 48 , of @entity218 , whose husband , an @entity3 bishop , was among the victims , said she thinks @entity69 deserves a tough sentence and the others should get less time if they get cult deprogramming counseling			1
' it 's a cult , ' she said			0
' their minds were programmed in the wrong way by @entity69 , so we feel like these people are very deceived and they are actually victims of @entity69			2
' she said there were no winners in the ordeal			0
' there 's no happy ending to this , ' she said			0
some @entity3 remain fearful of @entity69 , whose family denies his community is a cult			1
' i do n't want @entity69 to be around my nieces and nephews for the threats he made and things he done			2
so please keep @entity69 in jail , ' one person said in a letter to the court			2
the name and hometown were blocked in the court filing because of fear of retaliation			0
' please understand that we have many fears of him being released , ' another writer said			0
prosecutors submitted 14 letters , some warning that @entity69 and his family would disturb the peace of the @entity3 community			1
one called @entity69 an evil , dangerous person			2
on trial : @entity266 is accused of allegedly terrorizing the @entity3 community which he leads including having reported sexual relations with married women to ' cleanse ' them the government asked for a life sentence for @entity69 , saying he orchestrated the attacks and controlled members of his @entity3 settlement and frazzled nerves in quiet @entity3 communities in @entity12 and neighboring states			1
his attorney asked for a sentence of 1Â½ to two years			0
the government said the cuttings were an attempt to shame members @entity69 believed were straying from their beliefs			0
his followers were found guilty of carrying out the attacks			0
@entity36 said that women whose husbands are facing prison are anxious for them to return home , and that the children ask about their fathers			0
' they 're always talking about the day when @entity292 comes home again ; what they are going to do and what they want to do , ' @entity36 said			0
scandal : a @entity298 court has heard that the breakaway religious group spent months planning hair - cutting attacks against followers of their @entity3 faith wide - spread : six women were among those convicted of hate crimes after the 2011 attacks nine of ten men who were convicted have been locked up awaiting sentencing			1
the six women , who all have children , one with 11 , have been free on bond			0
the defendants were charged with a hate crime because prosecutors believe religious differences brought about the attacks			0
@entity36 said the @entity69 community has been steadfast in its belief that the beard - and hair - cutting attacks did n't rise to the level of a hate crime , but amounted to discipline amid a church feud that should n't involve civil authorities			1
' the beard , what it stands for me , what i know about it , once you 're married you just grow a beard , that 's just the way the @entity3 is , ' @entity36 said			0
as for the victims , he added : ' they got their beard back again , so what 's the big deal about it ? '			0
