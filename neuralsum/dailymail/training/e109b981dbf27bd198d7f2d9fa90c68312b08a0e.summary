with its magnificent stained - glass windows , it stands as a fitting memorial to the @entity4 pilots who gave their lives to save the nation from @entity8 invasion			1
but @entity9 can reveal that the ornately furnished chapel sir @entity11 insisted should remain a ' permanent ' shrine to the glorious @entity13 is to be closed down and boarded up			2
defying the wartime leader 's express wishes , defence chiefs have decreed that the £ 50,000 - a-year cost of running @entity18 of @entity19 is an ' inappropriate ' use of resources			1
@entity18 's stands on the site of the former @entity24 station at @entity25 , @entity26 , from where @entity44 and @entity45 pilots took off in 1940 to repel @entity47 's @entity46			1
inside , the names of those who died in the battle are inscribed on a roll of honour			0
it is these men and others who survived who inspired one of @entity11 most famous speeches : ' never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few			0
' the chapel is expected to attract 25,000 visitors this year , the 75th anniversary of the @entity4 , but is scheduled to close in 2016 unless a benefactor can be found			1
it is expected that 25,000 people will visit the chapel this year on the 75th anniversary of the @entity4 defence minister @entity66 said it ' no longer provides support to an operational @entity24 station and as the number of serving @entity24 personnel using the chapel is very low , continued support to the chapel would be an inappropriate use of defence resources			1
my officials … have met with the local chaplaincy council to discuss the closure of the site '			0
yet critics of the decision argue that thousands of people visit the chapel each year			0
along with regular weekly services , commemorative services are held on @entity4 sunday and @entity88			1
more than 5,500 people have signed a petition on a @entity92 website against the closure of @entity18 's			1
sir @entity11 took a personal interest in the fundraising drive that led to the chapel being built , and wrote to those who made donations , making clear his intention that @entity18 's should stand as a ' permanent shrine of remembrance ' to those who gave their lives , adding : ' we live to hold their reward inviolate and unfading			1
' @entity4 veteran @entity109 , 94 , described the closure as ' shameful ' and ' a sickening insult to those who flew and lost their lives '			2
mr @entity109 , a retired wing commander , said : ' the chapel is a priceless heirloom and it is being got rid of by sleight of hand			0
for these politicians and civil servants , this is just a stroke of a pen for them			0
' they should remember the significance of the @entity4			2
we show such contempt for the sacrifice of our veterans and our history			0
' an online petition has been set up to urge the @entity129 not to abandon its support of the chapel , which has already attracted more than 6,300 supporters			1
@entity18 's was built to replace a military chapel which was destroyed by fire in 1946			1
it was previously threatened in 1989 when the @entity129 closed @entity25 as an operational base , but was granted a reprieve because of its ' historical importance '			2
oak panels either side of the altar carry the names of hundreds of aircrew who died during the war and badges of 52 @entity24 squadrons which served at @entity25			2
the wooden floor is made from propeller blades from wartime aircraft , while some windows are dedicated to individual pilots who were based at the site			0
chapel custodian @entity155 said : ' there is so much history here			0
given the sacrifices made in the war , i 've considered it a privilege to look after the place			0
' a @entity129 spokesman said : ' in order to ensure that the defence budget is spent in the most appropriate way the @entity129 will look to relinquish ownership of @entity18 by march 2016			1
however , given its importance , we are exploring options that will ensure the heritage of the chapel is preserved			0
' some of the stained glass windows show the role played by those who supported the aircrew during the war			0
