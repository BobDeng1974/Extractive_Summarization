@entity0 , 29 , is carrying three - and - a - half stone of excess skin after losing 13 stone from weight loss surgery a chef who lost 13 stone after gastric bypass surgery is furious that the @entity7 has denied him second operation to remove three and a half stone of excess skin			1
@entity0 , 29 , from @entity9 , ballooned to 31 stone and underwent the £ 10,000 surgery eight years ago			1
his weight has since plummeted to 18 stone and he has been left carrying huge folds of saggy skin			2
but mr @entity0 claims the follow - up operation he was promised to remove the skin has been repeatedly turned down			2
he says the excess skin is now making his life so miserable he 's even considered suicide			1
mr @entity0 - who says he gained weight because of an under active thyroid - said : ' i was delighted when i was accepted for the gastric bypass			1
' after years of putting on weight as a teenager i thought my life would finally change for the better			2
' they promised me a follow - up operation to remove the skin , but they keep fobbing me off and i 'm getting desperate			0
' the skin 's so heavy on my front it makes my back hurt when i stand			0
i do n't understand how i can be rejected for surgery which i clearly need			0
' a gastric bypass is a permanent operation where part of the digestive system is removed so the patient can only absorb around 50 per cent of the calories he consumed			2
within a month of the operation at @entity43 in @entity44 , mr @entity0 had shed over three stone and in less than a year his weight plunged to 18 stone			1
the bachelor says his last relationship broke down because his girlfriend could n't handle his stress and mood swings			0
he has recently moved in with his father to be closer to the pub where he is now working but says his skin condition is ruining his life			0
' i 've been waiting eight years and it 's making my life a living hell - i 've got excess skin everywhere and it 's horrible , ' he says			1
' i 've got no self - confidence and i 'm too ashamed of my body to go swimming or wear tight clothes			0
overweight : @entity0 says he started piling on the pounds as a teenager due to an underactive thyroid ' i feel like i wo n't be able to have another relationship until i 've had the surgery and it 's removed			0
' @entity0 is now planning to appeal against the hospital 's refusal to give him the skin removal operation			2
excess skin is extremely common after weight loss surgery , explains @entity76 , a plastic surgeon who works privately and at @entity77 and @entity78			1
‘ this excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body , ’ he says			1
factors that affect how much skin is left after a dramatic weight loss include age , how quickly the weight was lost ( gastric bands are slower than bypasses , for example ) , and , for women , the number of children she has had			2
‘ after extreme weight loss , many patients develop an “ apron ” of skin around the abdomen , and loose skin under the arms , chest and inner thighs , ’ explains mr @entity76			0
‘ it can all be very uncomfortable and upsetting			0
’ @entity0 claims he was promised a follow - up operation to remove the skin but repeated requests to have it done have been turned down this excess skin can cause a range of medical problems , too			1
one of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial , fungal , or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry			1
patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise			0
excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo bariatric ( weight loss ) surgery			1
mr @entity76 says : ‘ sadly , there are some patients who do not seem to have been prepared for this situation beforehand , and post-weight loss can be a very disappointing and psychologically damaging time for them			0
some do question why they had the surgery in the first place			0

@entity0 was given a gastric bypass after weight *rocketed* to 31 stone

the 29 - year - old says life is ' living hell ' and has even *contemplated* suicide
