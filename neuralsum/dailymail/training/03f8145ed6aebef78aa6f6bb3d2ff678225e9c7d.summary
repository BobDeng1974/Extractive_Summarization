@entity1 travel to the @entity2 on sunday afternoon searching for redemption after the 4 - 1 mauling they suffered there last season			1
but how should @entity8 's side set themselves up tactically ? @entity10 's @entity9 takes a look			1
@entity1 watching @entity13 at the @entity14 , he did well operating in a midfield three			1
in his last two @entity1 games he has played in a similar role – on the side of a diamond that can become a three			2
he looked much better for it			0
it ’s a role that allows him to break forward from deep but also help out and cover when needed			0
@entity1 have finally found some rhythm and the system seems to be improving , but the problem now for @entity27 is picking out his best xi. @entity29 midfielder @entity13 has flourished for @entity1 in recent weeks @entity13 points to the name on his back after scoring for @entity1 away at @entity32 recently @entity34 playmaker @entity33 will miss the derby after coming off injured against @entity36 18 - 6 the aggregate scoreline to @entity38 in the last five @entity40 meetings 47 goals scored by @entity38 ’s strikers in 2014			1
that ’s almost twice as @entity1 ’s tally ( 26 ) , 476 goals in 167 @entity47 derbies			2
that ’s an average of 2.9 per game			0
@entity50 last year @entity38 found the perfect balance between defence and attack , but this season they are struggling			0
you have to admire @entity56 ’s philosophy of playing with two strikers but to continue their incredible record in this fixture – they have won five of the last six @entity64 @entity47 derbies – city need an extra midfielder			0
with @entity33 out , they will miss a lot of creativity so they could use two holding midfielders and push @entity72 forward			0
it ’s time for @entity72 to come alive and there ’s nothing like a derby game to bring out that passion and desire			2
@entity72 faces a fitness test on saturday to determine whether he 'll face @entity27 's @entity1 the day after @entity10 's @entity9 asserts that it is time for @entity72 to come alive from midfield this season			1

@entity8 's @entity1 travel to @entity38 on sunday
@entity13 has upped his game in a midfield three recently
@entity72 - if fit - needs to takes control of the midfield battleground
