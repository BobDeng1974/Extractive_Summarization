by @entity1 reporter published : 15:10 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 18:44 est , 22 january 2014 no clemency : @entity4 will be executed for murdering @entity6 police officer @entity5 in 1994 a @entity7 held on death - row in a @entity10 prison for murdering a policeman will be executed tonight despite last - ditch appeals from lawyers for clemency			1
@entity15 , 46 , was set for lethal injection this evening for shooting of @entity5 , 24 , in january 1994			1
the case has been a focus of protests in his home town and diplomatic pressure , with @entity24 secretary of state @entity23 calling for a delay to @entity4 's execution			1
@entity4 's lawyers had lodged an appeal arguing that he was ineligible for the death penalty due to mental impairment			1
but a court ruled the appeal had been filed too late			1
@entity5 , who had been on the force for two years , was driving @entity4 and another man from a robbery scene when evidence showed the officer was shot three times in the head and neck with a pistol @entity4 had concealed in his pants			1
the car crashed , and @entity4 fled on foot but was captured a few blocks away , still in handcuffs , carrying the robbery victim 's watch and wearing the victim 's necklace			2
@entity4 's attorneys and the @entity7 government contend @entity4 's case was tainted because he was n't advised under an international agreement that he could get legal help from his home nation following his arrest			1
secretary of state @entity23 previously asked @entity10 attorney general @entity59 to delay @entity4 's punishment , saying it ' could impact the way @entity24 citizens are treated in other countries			2
' the @entity65 repeated that stance tuesday			0
but @entity59 's office and the @entity69 district attorney opposed postponing what would be the first execution this year in the nation 's most active capital punishment state , where 16 people were put to death in 2013			2
at least two other inmates in similar circumstances were executed in @entity10 in recent years			2
the @entity7 government said in a statement this week it ' strongly opposed ' the execution and said failure to review @entity4 's case and reconsider his sentence would be ' a clear violation by the @entity24 of its international obligations			1
legal assistance guaranteed under that treaty could have uncovered evidence to contest the capital murder charge or provide evidence to keep @entity4 off death row , they said			2
rejected : a request by @entity24 secretary of state @entity23 , pictured , to delay @entity4 's punishment was rejected ' we are continuing to pursue our options for appeal , and vindication of mr @entity4 's right to review of the consular rights violation in his case , ' said @entity116 , one of @entity4 's lawyers			1
@entity4 's attorneys previously appealed to a federal court in @entity119 for an injunction against gov. @entity121 and the @entity122 , which he appoints			0
the board can recommend @entity121 grant clemency , but it 's an action they rarely take			0
a judge rejected that lawsuit tuesday			0
' it does n't matter where you 're from , ' @entity121 spokeswoman @entity129 said			0
' if you commit a despicable crime like this in @entity10 , you are subject to our state laws , including a fair trial by jury and the ultimate penalty			0
' @entity4 was in the @entity24 illegally and had a criminal record in @entity141 , where he had served time for robbery and was paroled , according to prison records			2
' not one person is claiming the suspect did n't kill @entity5 , ' @entity145 , president of the @entity146 , said			0
' he had the same rights as you and i would have			0
' this has been looked at , heard , examined and it 's time for the verdict of the jury to be carried out			0
' @entity4 was among more than four dozen @entity7 nationals awaiting execution in the @entity24 when the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 , ruled in 2004 they had n't been advised properly of their consular rights			1
the @entity162 subsequently said hearings urged by the international court in those inmates ' cases could be mandated only if @entity167 implemented legislation to do so			0
' unfortunately , this legislation has not been adopted , ' the @entity7 foreign ministry acknowledged .			0
