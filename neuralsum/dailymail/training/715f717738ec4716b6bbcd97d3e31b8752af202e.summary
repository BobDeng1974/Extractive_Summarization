in 1950 , @entity0 was @entity2 's fifth largest city and one of the most prosperous on the back of its booming motor industry			1
it prompted the construction of skyscrapers on the banks of the river and the development of vast suburban housing projects in the surrounding areas			2
but almost 55 years on , a dwindling motor industry and a dramatic fall in blue collar jobs has caused people to leave the @entity20 city , abandoning their homes and businesses			1
these aerial photos reveal the tiny urban island that is left - a clutter of high - rises surrounded by empty housing plots now covered in grass			1
there are vast areas of open spaces dotted with crumbling industrial buildings and barely - standing @entity34 homes until you reach the upmarket suburbs			1
the land then fills up with gated communities and huge estates complete with swimming pools , tennis courts and multi-car garages			1
it was demolished as part of an initiative to get rid of vacant schools the @entity61 / @entity60 neighborhood , which has suffered high rates of abandonment			0
since 1950 , when @entity0 was the fifth largest city in @entity2 , around 1.3million people have left few homes remain in the @entity68 neighborhood outside of the city , however work is being done to regenerate the area graffiti covers the walls of @entity34 homes in the area			1
many of the two - storey properties stand alone while the surrounding roads are practically cleared of cars the packard plant on the outskirts of the city , regarded as a sophisticated auto production facility when it opened in the early 1900s , is now in ruins			2
it is surrounded by blocks of houses that have been left empty this area at the edge of downtown @entity0 is covered with parking lots			1
many are completely empty and some have simply been abandoned the photos taken by pilot and aerial photographer @entity94 , and first published in the @entity95 , show the empty parking lots in the city bordering rows where only one or two houses are left			1
following the recession in 2008 , the metropolitan area was covered in rubble left from demolished homes as the the foundations in between the remaining properties			2
now these spaces have been covered over with grass creating a countryside just outside the dense urban area			2
one building , @entity112 , was home to a sophisticated automobile production facility in the early 1900s , now it lies in complete ruin			0
in @entity0 , the median household income is just $ 26,955 - with many of the poorest residents taking home much less - compared to a higher $ 101,094 in the suburb @entity121			0
similarly , the @entity0 last year declared the largest municipal bankruptcy in @entity2 history , while its neighbor 's quaint shops , beer gardens and antiques stores are thriving with residents			1
and in relation to crime rate , @entity0 's @entity129 takes an average of 30 minutes to respond to an incident , while @entity121 police typically arrive in just 3.4			0
this is perhaps unsurprising considering that @entity0 , once the industrial capital of the nation , was voted the most dangerous city in the country in 2012 , for the fourth year in a row			0
the city , left ravaged by dwindling blue - collar jobs , the decline of the auto industry and rising unemployment			1
it has lost more than 200,000 residents in the last decade - and 1.3million since the 1950s - as citizens have fled the blighted city for better - off suburbs with lower crime and better education			0
cordons surround the foundations where houses have been knocked down in the @entity157 neighborhood			0
those still standing have boarded - up doors and windows beyond the collection of empty properties and crumbling industrial buildings lie the sprawling estates			1
this home in @entity166 , @entity20 , is around 25 miles outside of @entity0 just 10 miles from downtown @entity0 is this mansion which sits on the banks of @entity168			2
the gated communities outside of the city have remained despite the 2008 recession and the declaration of bankruptcy the historic @entity174 , that was built in 1877 , was abandoned and its structure is now crumbling			1
developers have reportedly said it will take $ 7million of investment to restore it some of the spaces left vacant by abandoned houses have been turned into community gardens			2
in this @entity184 , there are 75 plots distributed to local businesses and residents an enormous swimming pool and tennis court can be seen outside this enormous property in @entity191 , @entity20 , around 25 miles northwest of downtown @entity0 earlier this year , the ' haves ' of @entity121 erected a fence on @entity194 , one of the few streets via which drivers can access @entity0			1
officials claimed it was set up for a farmers ' market , but the move sparked anger among @entity0 residents			0
and last winter , the suburb allegedly deliberately plowed snow to form another barrier			0
the tension is such that at the five @entity121 municipalities , dubbed ' the @entity209 ' , residents must show an @entity210 to enter public parks			0
it has also been reported that newly - elected @entity0 mayor @entity213 has now signed a deal with @entity121 that could help ease the tensions			0
in accordance with the deal , @entity0 will tear down some of the dilapidated houses around the border , while @entity121 will remove the ' haves / have - nots ' fences in return , it is said			0
in the booming @entity225 era , @entity0 was @entity2 's fifth - largest city , boasting an enormous population of 1,850,000 in 1950			1
the roofs of the houses in have crumbled and some have burned in @entity231 in @entity232			0
only one car sits outside a house on the street graffiti covers the walls of the buildings left in the @entity239			0
many are still occupied but some have been left surrounded by rubble and debris the @entity246 's @entity245 farm , which covers an acre of land fills up space left by the abandoned houses			2

in 1950 , with a population of almost two million , the @entity20 city was the fifth largest in the @entity2
almost 55 years on , 1.3 million people have left and the motor industry has crumbled , leaving homes abandoned
these aerial photos reveal how the city looks now - a tiny downtown urban island surrounded by empty lots
there are vast open open spaces dotted with abandoned buildings until you reach the sprawling suburban estates
the gated communities are filled with enormous mansions , swimming pools , tennis courts and multi-car garages
