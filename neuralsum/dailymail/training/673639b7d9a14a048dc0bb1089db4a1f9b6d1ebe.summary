@entity1 ' fairytale start to the season continued with what @entity3 called a ' magnificent ' full @entity6 debut against @entity7			1
the past few months have been a whirlwind for the versatile defender , who in the summer made a Â£ 16million move from @entity11 to @entity12			1
the 19 - year - old has since featured heavily in the @entity14 , started on numerous occasions in the @entity16 and made his @entity6 debut from the bench against @entity19 last month			1
@entity3 has praised former @entity11 team - mate @entity1 after he made his @entity6 debut @entity3 came off the bench as @entity6 beat @entity7 5 - 0 at @entity20 on thursday night @entity21 followed that up on thursday night with a first start for @entity6 as @entity25 's men easily swept away @entity7 5 - 0 at @entity20			1
' he was magnificent , ' @entity6 midfielder @entity3 said			2
' it was not an easy game for him			0
' he was always going to have lots of the ball and take risks with his passes because that 's what happens against teams that camp behind the ball			0
' he showed great composure and is going to go on to have many , many more caps			0
' @entity3 knows @entity21 better than most , having played alongside him at @entity11			1
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) were key members of the team as @entity11 impressed last season @entity3 says he knew @entity21 would end up playing for a ' top , top club ' like @entity12 the full - back only made his top - flight debut for @entity11 at the start of last term , but his rapid progress since then has not surprised his former captain			1
' i knew it was a matter of time before he possibly moved on or went to a big , big club , ' @entity3 said			2
' it has n't surprised me at all how quickly and how well he 's started			0
' i was watching the @entity14 qualification games and he took to them like a duck to water			0
' he was brilliant , showed great composure and he can play centre - half as well			2
' he is a very talented boy and it 's a great thing for @entity6			2
' @entity62 celebrate as @entity63 opens the scoring at @entity20 @entity21 , @entity3 and the rest of the @entity6 squad now face a quick turnaround as they travel to @entity69 looking for a third straight win in the @entity72 qualifying campaign			1
they approach sunday 's match buoyed by a decent performance against @entity7 , against whom @entity3 looked to have found the net for the first time for the @entity6			1
it was a fluky effort , given @entity81 shot went in off his heel , and one which was wrongly chalked off for offside			0
' i would have taken it , ' @entity3 said , with a laugh			0
' i was bitterly disappointed , but @entity81 and i had a laugh about it after the game			0

@entity1 made @entity6 debut against @entity7 on thursday
@entity3 expects defenders to go on to receive many more caps
@entity98 were @entity11 team - mates before summer *switches*
