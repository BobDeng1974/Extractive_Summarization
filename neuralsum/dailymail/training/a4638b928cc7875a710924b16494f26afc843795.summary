checking that no one is looking , i step gingerly on to the grassy bank			2
i find my usual spot and put the paper bag with the bottle on the picnic table near by			2
my heart is pounding in gleeful expectation			2
on the hottest day of the year , this is the moment i ’ve been waiting for			1
any minute now i will feel the intoxicating rush of endorphins that every addict craves			1
i lie back , wait and — whoosh , there it is — the blast of heat as the sun ’s rays burn into my skin			2
i am a sunbathing addict , in the proper sense of the word			1
although i know all about the dangers of sunbathing , i ca n’t stop exposing my body to the sun ’s harmful rays			1
as an educated and normally rational woman , of course i am aware of the danger : deaths from the worst form of skin cancer have more than trebled over the past 40 years — melanoma kills 1,550 people in @entity50 and @entity51 each year , compared with only 400 a year in the @entity52			1
i know i am risking my life every time i peel off my clothes to roast myself on a foreign beach for hours on end			2
ca n't stop , wo n't stop : @entity22 is still tanned despite the possibility of cancer the evidence of the sun ’s destructive effects are all too clear when i look in the mirror and see deep furrows across my forehead and crepey wrinkles in my decolletage			1
yet still i ca n’t — wo n’t — stop			1
the truth is , i love sunbathing far too much to worry about the cancer risk			1
for me there is nothing more fulfilling than lying in my bikini on a sun lounger , drinking in that glorious warmth as the sun ’s golden rays soak into my skin			2
the intoxicating smell of coconut oil and the sense of well - being are simply wonderful			1
then there is the thrill of seeing bright white tan lines against your bronzed body			1
i feel instantly sexier and more glamorous as i slip into a summer dress and my confidence soars			2
yes , worthier friends might nag me to stop , but i simply refuse to sit in the shade wearing @entity91 50 and a dreadful hat			1
now , at least , i have an excuse			2
according to scientists at @entity96 in the @entity97 , lying in the sun produces an emotional effect similar to that of heroin			1
the sun ’s rays stimulate production of endorphins , the ‘ feel - good ’ hormones that ease pain , and act on the body like opioid drugs			1
and , like those drugs , they are highly addictive			2
my obsession with ultraviolet light began in the late seventies			2
i was 16 and everybody was at it			2
the fashion was for a deep mahogany tan , and my friends and i wanted to ape the glamorous celebrities who wafted around places like @entity122 and @entity123 looking as if they had been dipped in molasses			1
cheap foreign holidays had just begun to be popular and my family were able to swap our usual rainy week in @entity128 for the beaches of @entity130			2
intoxicating : @entity22 loves nothing more than than lying in her bikini on a sun lounger suddenly we were plunged into a world where the temperature often reached 37c			0
my sisters and i would spend all day glued to our sunbeds			0
we would take a packed lunch to the beach and slather ourselves in delicious - smelling tanning unguents			1
it was so hot we would often lie in the sea , letting the waves cool us down			0
they say water reflects the sun ’s rays onto the body , making you even browner , so that was perfect			0
one day a friend suggested that we could ‘ speed up the process ’ by applying olive oil			0
for the next few days we lay on the beach basting our nut - brown bodies and reeking of salad dressing			1
bronzed and beautiful : despite criticisms , @entity22 has always loved the feeling of being tanned but in the evenings , when we walked down the streets flaunting our bronzed bodies and checking the admiring glances from local boys , it was worth it			1
there were times when my obsession with the sun backfired			0
sometimes i returned from the beach lobster - red and in agony with sunburn			1
i ’ve had sunstroke , too , once as a 17 - year - old and twice in my supposedly wiser 20s			1
i would wake up with flu - like symptoms and be confined to my villa , drinking bottle after bottle of water and taking painkillers			1
yet still i would be anxious to return to the beach			0
and it did n’t stop there			1
in the @entity186 , when the skin cancer scares began and everybody embraced the milk - bottle look , i carried on sunbathing with gusto			1
" there were times when my obsession with the sun backfired			0
sometimes i returned from the beach lobster - red and in agony with sunburn " it was around this time that the term ‘ tanorexia ’ was first coined , to describe the shocking number of young people desperate to ape permanently bronzed celebrities such as @entity202 and @entity203			1
the fact that i was working on a beauty magazine and received daily press releases on the dangers of the sun did nothing to blunt my enthusiasm			0
in summer , when everyone went to the local bistro for lunch , i would nip off to the town square , my bikini under my dress , to find a sunny spot and top up my tan			0
then i started to crave sunbathing in the winter months			1
one freezing january in the @entity186 , i persuaded my then boyfriend to take me to @entity221			0
the minute i stepped out of the plane into sunshine , i felt so glad to be alive			0
to hell with the consequences : @entity22 sunbathes whenever possible when he went off water - skiing , i planted myself on my sun lounger and did n’t move till @entity230 home , if there was a party or i was feeling a bit down , i would book a few sunbed sessions so i felt attractive again			1
even though i knew tanning beds aged the skin , i chose to ignore how dangerous they were			0
@entity239 friends tried to talk sense into me , but it was like telling a 40 - a - day smoker to give up there and then			1
i have tried to go cold turkey a couple of times			0
last year , as i approached 50 and started to worry about my wrinkles , i decided it was finally time to go pale			1
i was sick of people telling me that tans were no longer glamorous or sexy			1
‘ look , @entity22 ’s trying to be an extra out of @entity253 , ’ a spiteful acquaintance shouted one evening at a posh art do , as i wafted in bronzed and wearing a short dress			2
everyone laughed and the message was clear			0
i decided to avoid the sun altogether			0
that lasted just a week			0
i tried a salon spray - tan , too , but that did n’t do the trick , either			2
it left brown marks on a friend ’s sofa , blotched and disappeared in a couple of days			0
my skin was a bright shade of tangerine — and it did n’t feel anything like as good as soaking up the sun. so now i sunbathe whenever possible			0
to hell with the consequences			0
and as soon as summer is over , i start counting the days until my winter holiday			0
then , when i come back , i book another holiday straight away , just to keep me going			0
having a tan makes me feel good about myself			0
i do n’t smoke or drink			0
i eat brown rice and chia seeds			0
i sleep for eight hours a night and do a lot of exercise			0
so what if i sunbathe ? i enjoy it			0
so as soon as the mercury rises again , you can bet your bottom dollar i will be at the lido with all the other addicts , breathing in the smell of suntan cream .			0
