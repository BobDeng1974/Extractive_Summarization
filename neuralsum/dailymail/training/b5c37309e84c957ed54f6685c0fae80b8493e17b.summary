yard chiefs insist it is ‘ fair and proportionate ’			0
the @entity130 investigation is being carried out on behalf of the @entity131 , which has only 16 full - time officers			1
this is because @entity113 police have no jurisdiction in the @entity106 , meaning they have no right to charge people over offences there			0
