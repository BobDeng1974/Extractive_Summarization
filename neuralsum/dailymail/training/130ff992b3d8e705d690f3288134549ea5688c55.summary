by @entity0 the @entity1 , those bluff northerners who sing the benefits of their round teabags , have suffered a nasty blow after taking on @entity7 and their pyramid bags - and losing			1
executives at the company behind the plain speaking popular cartoon characters were furious after their rivals appeared to trash their round teabags in a fun tv commercial			0
@entity7 and their brand ambassadors , comedian @entity17 and his monkey puppet , suggested that their pyramid tea bags were better at letting the flavour flood out than round ones			1
however , in a ruling published today the watchdog has sided with @entity7 and decided that @entity26 and its tea folk were simply wrong			2
significantly , it accepted that the @entity7 pyramid bags really are better at releasing the flavour than the round ones promoted by @entity26 ’s characters in their flat caps			1
the decision could have serious consequences , for it may be enough to convince the nation ’s tea lovers to switch to @entity7 and its superior bags			0
the @entity23 said the commercial featured the comedian and the puppet monkey in a kitchen comparing the performance of the @entity7 pyramid bag against a round one			1
@entity17 said : ‘ monkey , you know how you always say , ‘ there ’s no other tea to beat @entity7 ’ … what if you ’re lying ? ’ @entity59 showed the leaves in a pyramid bag had 77 per cent more room to move than in a round one the monkey then set about proving his point and made two cups of tea , one with a pyramid bag and one with a round bag and stated : ‘ @entity7 uses pyramid bags , so if we test one against a regular tea bag ... you ’ll see the tea has got more room to move , freeing the great fresh taste for a perfect cuppa			1
’ @entity26 is owned by the @entity79 company , @entity78 , which complained the images exaggerated the performance of the @entity7 pyramid bags			2
it challenged the claim the tea has more room to move so ‘ freeing the great fresh taste ’ it also argued that the comparison with a round teabag ‘ denigrated ’ the @entity26 brand – even though it was not named - and portrayed it in a negative light			0
@entity7 , which is owned by @entity93 , countered by offering evidence of tests comparing the performance of different bags in hot water after 40 seconds and two minutes of brewing			0
both showed a win for the pyramid over round , in terms of colour and strength			0
separate research showed the leaves in a pyramid bag had 77per cent more room to move than in a round one			1
@entity7 insisted the commercial was not meant to be seen as a direct comparison to @entity26 because round teabags are also offered by other brands and supermarkets			1
backing @entity7 , the @entity23 said : ‘ @entity93 provided test results which showed that the infusion of tea , at 40 seconds and two minutes into brewing , was greater when using a pyramid teabag than when using a round teabag			2
we therefore concluded that the ad did not exaggerate the capability and performance of the advertised product and was not misleading			0
‘ @entity93 provided relevant modelling and measurements to demonstrate that the tea in the pyramid teabag would have more room to move … and that the pyramid teabag had a greater brewing efficiency than the round teabag			2
’ @entity7 insisted the commercial was not meant to be seen as a direct comparison to @entity26 because round teabags are also offered by other brands and supermarkets @entity26 , which is owned by the @entity79 company @entity78 , complained the performance of the @entity7 pyramid bags had been exaggerated and challenged the claim the tea has more room to move the watchdog added : ‘ while a large portion of round teabags were owned by @entity26 , we considered that consumers would not immediately identify a round teabag as being a @entity26 teabag			1
' because we considered that the comparison was not made with an identifiable competitor , we concluded that the ad did not denigrate @entity26			0
’ a spokesman for @entity7 said : ‘ we ’re thrilled that the @entity23 have agreed with what @entity7 fans have known for years , pyramid bags really do make the best cup of tea			0
’ @entity26 had no one was available to comment on the ruling .			0
