pilots have been asked not to fly over @entity2 zoo to avoid disturbing pregnant panda @entity3			1
the @entity5 published a notice asking pilots not to fly in the area , after the zoo requested a reduction in noise during the breeding season			2
zookeepers asked for the measure to be taken after @entity3 - whose name means ‘ @entity16 ’ - was artificially inseminated earlier this year			1
if the pregnancy is successful the panda cub will be the first ever to be born in @entity37 , a huge success for conservationists and a coup for @entity41 in the run - up to the independence vote in september			2
public interest in the panda and her mate @entity46 is very high , undimmed by two previous unsuccessful breeding attempts			2
the pair , who are on loan to @entity31 from @entity51 , failed to mate in 2012 and @entity3 had a failed pregnancy last year			1
this time , aided by modern artificial insemination techniques , scientists hope they could finally see a panda cub - or even twins or triplets - born in @entity37			0
if the pregnancy is successful it could mean a £ 50million boost to the @entity41 economy , studies suggest			0
pilots approaching @entity64 have been asked to avoid a one mile radius of the local zoo @entity64 , pictured is approximately four miles west of @entity31 where @entity3 is kept a notice to @entity68 , or @entity69 , was published by the @entity5 asking pilots not to fly in the area if possible to reduce noise from low - flying planes and helicopters			1
notams are usually issued to alert aircraft pilots to potential hazards along a flight route such as cranes , closed runways or large public events			0
the notice covering @entity31 was issued in july to protect all its animals , notably its breeding penguin population			2
but the likely pregnancy of @entity3 was also a factor , the zoo said			1
it comes during the @entity89 and @entity90 , which sees increased air traffic over the city , including @entity94 displays			0
a spokesman for the zoo told @entity98 newspaper : ‘ @entity31 has a @entity69 in place over its airspace to prevent disturbance to all animals in the collection , yet it is mainly asked in consideration of the breeding penguin colony			1
‘ it is particularly relevant at this time of year due to the regular increased activity of low - flying aircraft and hovering helicopters which occur as a result of the festival			0
‘ we have been in contact with the @entity90 and the @entity94 for several years now and they have both always been very supportive and considerate of our requests			0
’ the giant panda was artificially inseminated on april 13 and experts at the zoo monitored @entity3 closely in the following months			1
last week it was revealed that the latest scientific data suggests she is pregnant			0
zookeepers have said things are progressing as expected and they are ‘ keeping their fingers crossed ’ for the arrival of a cub at the end of this month			0
@entity3 ’s hormone and protein levels are being checked regularly but it will not be known for certain if she is pregnant until she gives birth			1
a spokesman for the @entity5 said : ‘ following a request from @entity31 through the air traffic control unit at @entity64 , we issued a @entity69 on july 11 requesting pilots to not fly within a one - mile radius of the zoo or below 1,900 feet above sea level			1
‘ the @entity69 was advisory so if necessary , pilots could still fly through this area providing they complied with the rules of the air			0
‘ the @entity69 expired on july 31 and there are no plans to issue any similar advice to pilots operating in the area			0

@entity3 the panda was artificially inseminated in april in @entity31
pilots have been asked to avoid the airspace around @entity31
zoo keepers believe @entity3 is pregnant and could give birth this month
