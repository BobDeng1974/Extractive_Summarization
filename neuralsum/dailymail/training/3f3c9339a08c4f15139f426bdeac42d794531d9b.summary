by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 16:09 est , 13 july 2013 designer @entity1 makes wedding dresses that are the stuff of fairy tales – she created @entity6 ’s gown for her marriage to princess @entity9 ’s son @entity8			1
and her beautiful daughter @entity10 has the enviable job of modelling some of her fabulous work			1
yet while @entity10 may look perfect dressed in princess - pink tulle and satin , life is far from easy for the 12 - year - old			1
she suffers from a rare , incurable lung condition that has seen her hospitalised 32 times – 12 of which required intensive care			1
incurable : @entity1 's daughter @entity10 , 12 , has been hospitalised 32 times as a result of her lung condition which makes her vulnerable to infection @entity10 has bronchiectasis , which causes the airways to become abnormally widened , leading to a build - up of excess mucus			1
this can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection and even a common cold could become life - threatening			1
her first emergency is etched in her mother ’s mind			0
‘ it was a warm day in july 2002 , just after @entity10 ’s second birthday , and we ’d been picnicking in the countryside , ’ says @entity1 , who lives in @entity37 with husband @entity38 , her business manager , and children @entity40 , 16 , @entity10 and her twin brother @entity42 , 12			1
‘ she was a normal , bouncy toddler , but within an hour of getting home she went limp , her lips turned blue and she was gasping to breathe			0
@entity38 and i drove her to @entity49 in @entity50			0
’ @entity10 was treated with intravenous antibiotics , oxygen and inhalers for what was believed to be a one - off virus			1
model child : @entity10 modelled her mother 's creations between treatments for her incurable illness to give her something to look forward to four days later she was discharged			1
but the family ’s relief was short - lived			0
three weeks later the same thing happened , and a further 15 hospital admissions followed in the next two years			0
@entity1 , @entity38 and anyone who ever looked after @entity10 at home or school became adept at recognising the signs that she was going to be ill. ‘ i was responsible for the livelihoods of 40 staff so i could n’t just walk away from my business to be at home full - time , and we wanted @entity10 ’s life to feel as normal as possible between episodes , ’ says @entity1 , whose other children do not suffer from the condition			1
‘ we made sure anyone who looked after her was fully briefed on her condition			2
@entity80 adds : ‘ before an episode , there would be a change in her demeanour			0
when she was well she had a good appetite and was energetic and always laughing			0
before an attack , she ’d become withdrawn and we ’d spot tugging in her neck where her airways were straining , plus the familiar blue tinge to her lips			0
it was easier when she was four and she could say ‘ ‘ doctor ’ ’ if she felt poorly and ‘ ‘ hospital ’ ’ if she thought something serious was about to happen			0
’ @entity96 can affect anyone at any age			0
an estimated one in 1,000 adults and one in 10,000 children in the @entity103 have the condition			2
about 9,000 are admitted to hospital every year , and in 2010 there were 1,000 deaths with bronchiectasis an underlying factor			2
the lungs are full of tiny branching airways , known as the bronchi , whose role is to move oxygen into even smaller sacs called alveoli that transfer oxygen into the blood			0
hospitalised : @entity10 aged seven during one of her dozens of hospital visits going through treatment for bronchiectasis professor @entity124 , of the @entity125 , says : ‘ @entity96 means that the airways dilate in the lung due to an infection which then causes the production of a lot of phlegm			1
this can trigger a vicious circle of mucus gathering in the bronchi , making them prone to infection and further widening them , leading to a build - up of more mucus			2
‘ it ’s common in those with cystic fibrosis , but can also be caused by a previous childhood lung infection , or if a problem with the immune system has led to the bronchi becoming damaged due to infection			2
’ any cold or virus could put @entity151 into a critical state			0
‘ even going shopping , we risked her picking up a cold and very quickly her lungs would get infected and close down , ’ says @entity1			1
the turning - point for @entity10 ’s health was in 2007 when immunology specialists at @entity160 realised the weak link was in her immune system and that she has no resistance to pneumonia			2
‘ we were then able to prevent future attacks with the swift use of antibiotics when symptoms presented , regular pneumonia vaccinations , a steroid inhaler and daily physiotherapy sessions , ’ says @entity1			2
prof @entity124 says physio is a key treatment for bronchiectasis and that although living with the condition can be distressing , the outlook for most sufferers is good			2
‘ it does n’t disappear , but in most cases it ’s possible to manage through medication and physiotherapy to strengthen and clear the lungs , ’ he says			0
@entity10 ’s condition began to stabilise in 2008 and she now loves to play netball , horse - ride and dance			1
‘ she has n’t been hospitalised for four years , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ she still uses an inhaler daily and holidays are planned with military precision to ensure medical care is nearby			0
but finally , i feel i can start to relax			0
