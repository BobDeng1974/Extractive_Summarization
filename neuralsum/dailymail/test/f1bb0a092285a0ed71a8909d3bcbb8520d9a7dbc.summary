but the former prime minister , famously partial to a daytime drink , appeared to be struggling to keep his eyes open as the leaders posed for official photographs			2
the amusing photographs seem to show @entity1 nodding off while sat next to @entity6 , and among the likes of then prime minister @entity23 and @entity52 wartime commander @entity51 @entity34			1
after a short nap , @entity1 looks slightly sheepish as he is awoken from his slumber by fellow guest lord @entity36 , but fortunately no one else seems to have noticed his quick snooze			1

@entity120 , from the auction house , said : ' these photos were taken at a reunion dinner hosted by president @entity6 while he was on tour in @entity52 in 1959			1
' it was the 20 - year anniversary of the invasion of @entity17 which kickstarted the @entity5 and so @entity6 gathered all the military leaders for what used to be known as a ' stag party '			2
' the group got together for official photos to be taken but it appears like @entity1 might have partaken in some daytime drinking because he nodded off while sat right next to @entity6			1
' @entity1 was fond of a drink while he was in office , and his habit was probably much worse once he retired			0
' the photos show one of the other guests dutifully prodding @entity1 to wake him up , and the former prime minister looking a little bemused			0
' the other interesting thing about this set is that all the big @entity52 players from the @entity19 high command were at this dinner , including @entity34			0
' @entity34 had been very critical of @entity6 in the years following the war , and it was no secret that they did n't like each other , but he was duly invited to the dinner			0
' newspaper reports of the dinner noted that the pair sat close to one another and while no - one knows what was said they seemed to have buried the hatchet			0
' the auction will take place on april 15 .			0
