@entity16 , @entity36 and the rest of the @entity1 squad underwent a light workout in a session partly open to media at their @entity17 before flying out to @entity6			1
@entity16 appeared to have no adverse reaction to the injury and he seemed in good spirits during training			2
@entity1 boss @entity12 revealed that @entity16 was ‘ touch and go ’ for the second leg at the @entity14 after suffering what was thought to be a badly bruised toe in last week ’s 1 - 1 draw at @entity8 , but it now appears that the damage may be more serious			1
