very few people have lived to tell the tale of what it is like to be inside a tornado – and you ca n’t rely on @entity7 's @entity6 but now a video has emerged taken from inside a car , which survived a tornado passing over it			1
the dashboard - mounted device recorded the incredible transformation of the weather from persistent rain to a terrifying cyclone of wind uprooting trees and whipping debris through the air			1
the footage is thought to be coming from the eye of the storm it was left switched on by its owner who was not in the car			1
the footage was filmed in @entity36 , @entity37 last year , but was released this week on @entity38			1
the video shows the weather changing from calm to chaos in under a minute , starting with raindrops rolling down the car ’s windscreen , with the sky a foreboding grey and descending into large pieces of wood being flung through the air and the car ’s previously clean glass covered in pieces of debris			1
the video shows the weather changing from calm to chaos in under a minute , starting with raindrops rolling down the car ’s windscreen , with the sky a foreboding grey ( pictured ) the end of the video ( pictured ) shows large pieces of wood being flung through the air and the car ’s previously clean glass covered in pieces of debris a tornado is a narrow , rapidly spinning column of air around an intense low pressure centre that reaches the ground from cumulonimbus clouds , also known as thunderstorm clouds , according to the @entity75			1
tornadoes have a narrow width , usually up to 100m but the damage can be concentrated and severe			0
as they develop , funnel shaped clouds extend from the base of the cloud and when these reach the ground , a tornado is formed			0
tornadoes can have wind speeds up to 300mph , and when they touch the ground can destroy trees and buildings in their path , throwing heavy objects like cars though the air like a frisbee			1
tornadoes which occur over water are referred to as a waterspout and those which do not touch ground are referred to as a funnel cloud			0
the highest surface wind speed ever recorded of 302mph is a result of the @entity99			0
the greatest distance travelled by a single tornado was 219 miles ( 352km ) from @entity102 , @entity103 to @entity104 , @entity105 , on 18 march 1925			0
the most tornadoes in a single year were recorded in 2004			1
incredibly , despite trailers and trees nearby being thrown around and uprooted , the car remains intact and on the ground , indicating perhaps it was in the eye of the storm , which if so , was not as calm as many might imagine			1
it has not yet been confirmed by @entity37 's meteorological services whether the footage really does capture a video from the centre of a tornado			1
dr @entity122 told @entity123 that it is very hard to tell and that there are few specifics available			0
' we ca n’t be sure of the exposure of the car – it appears to be surrounded by buildings which will give it some protection , ' she said			2
' the type of car will also have had an impact – a solid 4x4 is less likely to be lifted compared to a small car			2
' a spokesman for the @entity141 ' @entity140 ( @entity140 ) said that the car could actually be places on the near edge of the tornado			2
this is because , ' early on , everything is moving away from the camera and there 's very little that comes towards the camera at the end			2
' ' even if it had had a direct passage by the middle of the tornado where , in some cases , the winds might be weaker , you 've have had all the strong winds on either side of the tornado go by			0
' based on how the wood flies through the air , he thinks that the tornado may have reached speeds of up to 113mph ( 217kph )			2
eyewitness accounts from people who claim to have been inside a tornado are rare , but seem to support the theory that the eye of the storm is eerily calm			1
@entity174 , a farmer from @entity175 claims to have been in the eye of a storm in 1928 and said that once he was inside a tornado , everything was ‘ as still as death , ’ how @entity179 reported			2
he said there was a strong gassy smell , which made it hard to breathe and looked up to see the circular shape of the tornado around him			0
another farmer called @entity188 found himself inside a tornado in @entity190 in 1951			0
he ran inside his house when hail stones that size of tennis balls began raining down			0
he then reportedly heard a low rumbling and then silence			0
the roof of his house was ripped off and he was surrounded by a wall of clouds illumined blue from lightning , he said			0
the footage was filmed in @entity36 , @entity37 ( marked on the map ) last year , but was released this week the @entity203 defines a tornado , known as a twister , ‘ a violent rotating column of air , in contact with the ground , either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud , and often ( but not always ) visible as a funnel cloud			1
a stock image is pictured			0

dashboard mounted camera captured the destruction in @entity36 , @entity37
storm occurred last year but the video has only just been released
it shows the transformation of weather from calm to chaos in a minute
wooden boards can be seen *soaring* through the air
it is thought the car is in the calm ' @entity234 ' but this is *unconfirmed*
