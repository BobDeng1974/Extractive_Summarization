by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a convicted pedophile and murderer who has been on death row for over 20 years has stopped a pharmacy from providing the drug that was to be used for his lethal injection - just one week out from his execution			1
@entity10 , 47 , filed a federal lawsuit against the @entity12 - a compounding pharmacy in @entity13 , @entity14 , that provides a made - to - order drug to the @entity16 , where @entity10 will be put to death			1
the claim argued that the drug would cause @entity10 ' inhumane pain and suffering '			1
@entity10 - who pleaded guilty to abducting , raping and stabbing to death a 15 - year - old @entity22 girl in 1989 at the age of 22 - was scheduled to be executed on february 26			1
execution drugs have become increasingly difficult to obtain because most major licensed drug makers have stopped selling pharmaceuticals for use in the death penalty			0
@entity10 , 47 , has been on death row in @entity30 for over 20 years for abducting , raping and stabbing to death a 15 - year - old girl , but has stopped an @entity14 pharmacy from providing the drugs for his lethal injection on the grounds they would cause him ' inhumane pain ' the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , has agreed not to provide any drugs that would be used in the execution of @entity40 following a federal lawsuit			1
the @entity16 are said to use the compound pharmacy to source drugs for their lethal injections , after many pharmaceutical companies stopped providing drugs that would be used in lethal injections many states , like @entity30 , have turned to compounding pharmacies , which manufacture drugs for individual clients			1
unlike major drug companies , compounding pharmacies are not regulated by the @entity53			0
in his lawsuit , @entity10 alleged that @entity30 turned to @entity55 to supply compounded pentobarbital - a powerful prescription barbiturate , or sedative - because the only licensed manufacturer of the drug , @entity61 - based @entity60 , refuses to provide it for lethal injections			1
@entity10 contends that several recent executions in which compounded pentobarbital was used showed it would likely cause ' severe , unnecessary , lingering and ultimately inhumane pain '			2
his attorneys used the instance of @entity69 , 38 , who was executed at @entity70 on january 9			0
within 20 seconds of receiving the drug , @entity69 is said to have said : ' i feel my whole body burning			0
' @entity10 's attorneys alleged the statement was consistent with the receipt of ' contaminated ' pentobarbital			2
now , according to court documents filed late monday , @entity69 's lawyers have asked a judge to dismiss the case because @entity55 had ' agreed ' not to prepare or provide any drug for use in @entity10 's lethal injection			1
the pharmacy also acknowledged it had not already provided any drug to the @entity16 for the execution , according to @entity10 's attorney , @entity88			1
the only licensed manufacturer of the drug pentobarbital , @entity60 , which distributes it under the name @entity91 , refused to supply it for the means of lethal injection			0
the drug is a prescription sedative the linchpin of @entity10 's lawsuit was the january execution of @entity69 , 38 ( pictured ) , who is said to have screamed out in pain after being administered compounded pentobarbital what remains unclear , however , is how the result will affect @entity10 's planned execution			1
@entity30 gov. @entity108 suggested last week the state had enough drugs for the lethal injection			2
while refusing to say ' yes ' or ' no ' , he twice said the @entity16 was prepared			0
the @entity16 has refused to comment on the case or their use of pentobarbital , saying the ways in which prisoners are executed are not for public knowledge			0
the @entity12 has also declined to comment , saying that the orders they produce are confidential			0
this is not the first time @entity10 has contested the drugs used in his execution			2
he was hours away from undergoing a lethal injection in 2006 when the @entity125 @entity124 granted a stay of execution over concerns about whether the state 's three - drug method could violate the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment			2
@entity30 has executed three men in the past three months , all of them using pentobarbital			0
@entity30 had previously used a three - drug execution protocol .			0
