@entity1 could afford to send @entity3 astronauts to @entity5 orbit by 2033 and onto the @entity5 's surface by 2039 , a new report has claimed			1
the @entity7 analysed the feasibility and cost of a crewed mission to orbit the @entity11 in 2033 , leading up to a crewed landing on the @entity5 in 2039			1
it concluded that such a plan could indeed fit within @entity1 's human space exploration budget - but that politics is holding the decision back			1
crewmembers would be able to study @entity23 , @entity5 ' other moon , and potentially teleoperate rovers on the @entity5 surface			2
the panel said the current plan would use an @entity34 spacecraft to move crewmembers from @entity36 into orbit and back down			0
' we believe we now have an example of a long - term , cost - constrained , executable humans - to - @entity5 program , ' @entity37 , a professor in the @entity38 of @entity39 and @entity40 and a member of the @entity7 's board of directors , said			1
' this workshop was an important step in community - building among the many groups interested in @entity5 science and exploration			1
' the @entity7 's ceo ( and former tv ' @entity54 ' ) @entity55 , said : ' getting humans to @entity5 is far more complex than getting to @entity36 's @entity57 , ' said @entity55			1
' but space exploration brings out the best in us			1
' by reaching consensus on the right set of missions , we can send humans to @entity5 without breaking the bank			1
' the workshop 's 70 attendees discussed the technical feasibility , affordability and benefits of a proposed schedule to get humans into orbit around @entity5 and eventually onto the planet 's surface , using a detailed plan was not created by @entity7 , but was proposed in a separate report co-created by @entity1 's @entity76			1
@entity77 is the larger and inner of the two natural satellites of @entity5 , the other being @entity80			2
both moons were discovered in 1877			0
the workshop ' reached a consensus ' on a series of key points , including that an orbital mission would be required prior to a crewed mission to the surface of @entity5 , and an independent cost estimate showed that the program would fit into the @entity1 budget , assuming the agency ' ends its lead role in the @entity94			1
' the 2033 orbital mission was identified as the crucial first step of the plan , comparing it to @entity1 's @entity100 mission , which took astronauts into orbit around the moon before humans landed on the satellite 's surface			1
the @entity23 orbital mission would last approximately 30 months , with nine months of travel each way and 12 months in orbit , the panelists said			2
crewmembers would be able to study @entity23 , @entity5 ' other moon , and potentially teleoperate rovers on the @entity5 surface			2
the panel said the current plan would use an @entity34 spacecraft to move crewmembers from @entity36 into orbit and back down			0
' while the conditions for another @entity123 - era @entity122 moment do n't exist , we have a highly skilled scientific engineering and policy community that is eager to get going on sending humans to @entity5 , ' said dr. @entity127 , workshop co-chair and professor emeritus , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132			2
' we believe the consensus points achieved during this workshop can get us moving down the path to the @entity5			0
' the ' @entity136 @entity5 ' workshop took place in @entity138 various forms of propulsion have been touted for a mission to @entity5 , including chemical , ion ( electric ) and nuclear			1
but while nuclear is often said to be the ' holy grail ' , the team found it did not noticeably shorten the mission over other versions			0
shown is an illustration of a concept @entity153 @entity127 said he thinks a decision on whether to adopt the plan is ' an issue for the next president			0
' @entity37 said that , in the past , @entity5 missions may have been limited by technological or scientific challenges , but that no longer appears to be the case			1
' in the past , when the question of humans to @entity5 came up , i would typically cite a number of major hurdles : biomedical , launch systems and so forth , ' he said			0
' and as of today , i think that those risks have either been reduced or you know how to minimize them , and so i am at the same place that @entity127 [ @entity173 ] and @entity55 [ @entity172 ] [ are ] , that i think the issue now is [ â€¦ ] political will			0
' shown is a graph of the different types of propulsion for a mission to @entity5 , how much they would weigh and their travel time			2
@entity182 is a type of chemical propulsion , @entity181 is nuclear propulsion , @entity187 - @entity186 is ion ( electric ) propulsion and @entity190 is @entity191 owing to the orbits of @entity36 and @entity5 there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place			2
our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles ( 54.6 million km ) , but can be as distant as 250 million miles ( 400 million km )			0
for this reason spacecraft to @entity5 , such as the @entity202 , have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned			0
the next window is open from january 2016 to april 2016 , and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet			0
for a future manned mission , they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one , which will take two years in total			0
just getting there will take up to nine months			0
the astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back - a total of around three years .			0

@entity7 analysed the feasibility and cost of missions
crewed mission to orbit the @entity11 in 2033 first step
