@entity0 has revealed that @entity1 rang him for advice before signing @entity3 for £ 16m on transfer deadline day - and that he is delighted that his strong recommendation paid off for both @entity6 and @entity3			1
@entity1 has since said that he only appreciated quite how good a player @entity3 was after seeing him close up every day in training - and @entity0 says he gave similar feedback to the @entity6 manager when @entity1 was weighing up whether to buy @entity3 or not last august			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity1 and i speak more often than most managers as he always comes up to the directors ' box at @entity6 and i speak to him very often			1
and we spoke of course before he signed @entity3			1
i was singing @entity3 's praise so i 'm delighted that @entity1 has seen that my judgement was n't wrong and that he shares that judgement			1
@entity3 joined @entity6 from @entity20 for £ 16m on transfer deadline day @entity3 scores the winning goal for @entity6 against his former club in the @entity25 quarter - final ' we like @entity3 very much			1
we 've always shown faith in @entity3			1
many times he 's been selected by me and my staff when he was not actually playing for @entity20			2
sometimes he 's not even been on the bench and yet still we ' ve selected him because we think he has the qualities required			0
' and what @entity3 really needs is the faith of his manager , which he obviously has from @entity1 , to get more games			1
and then i think we 'll see more and more performances from him that we 've been lucky enough to see with @entity37 and @entity6 were lucky enough to see the other night when he played at @entity38			2
i thought he was really , really good			0
' @entity3 is likely to start for @entity37 in their @entity40 qualifier against @entity41 next friday			2
he made 24 starts for @entity20 last season and since moving to @entity6 on transfer deadline day has already started 25 times with at least eleven games remaining , which @entity0 believes is benefitting the @entity37 player			1
@entity1 and @entity0 in the director 's box at the @entity50 ' @entity1 has used him and he 's played quite a lot of games if you compare it to the games he played for @entity20			1
with us he 's always done what i think is a very , very good job for the team			0
there are n't many times when he 's played for @entity37 where i 've been disappointed in him or in his work rate or desire			0
but of course it would be great if he gets himself as one of the first names on the @entity6 team sheet and play for them every week , that would be a bonus certainly for him and it wo n't do us any harm			2
' i 'm pretty sure he must have benefitted ( from @entity1 's confidence in him )			2
but it 's not something that has struck me like a bolt of lightning , that 's for sure			0
when he 's come with us he 's not lacked confidence ever			0
he knows what we want from him			0
and he knows that he can deliver what we want from him			0
he knows that we believe in him			0
i 've never felt he 's ever come to us with a massive lack of confidence			0
