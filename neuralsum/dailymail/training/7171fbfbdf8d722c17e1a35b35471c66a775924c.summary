@entity0 has admitted she has ¿ grave ¿ concerns about fraud in the student visa system @entity0 has admitted she has ‘ grave ’ concerns about fraud in the student visa system , which allows 200,000 foreigners into @entity7 each year			1
the home secretary said despite @entity11 efforts to crack down on visa abuse , applicants were ‘ finding other ways around the system ’			1
mrs may made her comments after she was confronted with evidence from a @entity19 investigation exposing rampant fraud in the student visa system			1
the programme exposed widespread abuse , including language tests at ‘ trusted ’ colleges taken by fluent @entity27 speakers , and multiple choice tests in which answers were read out by the invigilators			1
it also revealed a network of criminal immigration agents providing , for a fee , any document required to get around @entity37 checks			0
consultants offered undercover reporters a guaranteed pass in an @entity27 language test for £ 500 and a bank statement showing they had enough money to support themselves for £ 250			1
they were also offered an ‘ all in ’ package of everything needed for a visa for £ 2,800			1
one lawyer told the programme the student visa system was now a criminal ‘ free for all ’			1
mrs may said the government had done a huge amount to tackle fraud , but admitted there was still abuse in the system			2
she told the programme : ‘ the numbers of student visas have gone down and the amount of abuse has gone down			0
‘ but it ’s clear that people are finding other ways around the system			1
’ she added : ‘ in the immigration world you can never say you ’ve done everything , you always have to look because people will look for the new way round the system			2
‘ i have known there is abuse of the system but well done for uncovering the further abuse that is taking place			2
‘ what you have shown is that people effectively go in to a situation where [ the entry requirements ] are being faked for them and that is a matter of grave concern			0
’ ‘ we now have to look at the sort of documents people are providing and look at the kind of scams being undertaken behind that			0
’ business secretary @entity84 oppose new restrictions while @entity86 said the investigation showed @entity0 is presiding over a failing immigration system under the coalition , more than 700 colleges have been banned from bringing students in to the country from outside the @entity93			2
new tests , including @entity27 language and means testing , have been introduced to try and stop bogus students coming to @entity7 to work			1
the programme will prompt further calls for tighter controls on the student visa system			0

another 100,000 students already here have their visas extended			0
@entity110 , including business secretary @entity84 , oppose new restrictions , saying they act as a block on genuine students			0
last year it emerged there may be up to 90,000 foreign students living in @entity7 illegally			0
audits by universities and colleges threw up tens of thousands of students accused of breaking the rules by failing to attend their courses or even register			0
shadow home secretary @entity86 said : ‘ this investigation shows @entity0 is presiding over a failing immigration system which too often focuses on the wrong thing and where illegal immigration is a growing problem			1
the danger of having such a weak system which is so easily and brazenly exploited is that it is unfair , undermines public confidence – and also makes it harder to maintain support for the graduate migration we need			0
’ the @entity27 tests seen in the report – said by @entity19 to be run by company @entity138 – have since been suspended by the @entity37			1
mrs may said : ‘ this type of abuse is not acceptable and we will continue to clamp down			2
