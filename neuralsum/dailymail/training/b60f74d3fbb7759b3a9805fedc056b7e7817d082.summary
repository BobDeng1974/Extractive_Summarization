for a year - and - a - half , @entity0 and @entity1 travelled back and forth between @entity2 and @entity3 after meeting online and falling hopelessly in love			1
at 5,437 miles apart , the couple 's relationship was just about as long - distance as it gets - but mr @entity0 used that to his advantage			1
knowing that his @entity11 - loving girlfriend 's favourite musical was @entity12 , he coordinated a surprise flashmob for her which culminated on him getting down on one knee			2
luckily for him , in front of the flash mob that he had arranged and the crowd that gathered to watch the romantic gesture , as well as the camera crew he had brought in to record the proposal , she said yes			2
' i picked my favourite song from the show , @entity39 , and i really wanted to make it special to us so i rewrote the lyrics to be more personal to our unique relationship			2
' the original song 's lyrics ask : ' five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes			0
how do you measure , measure a year ? ' after finding out the distance from @entity2 to @entity3 , the producer changed the words to : ' five thousand , four hundred and thirty seven miles			0
how do you measure the distance of love ? ' and renamed the song @entity52			0
mr @entity0 emerges from the crowd to serenade his soon - to - be fianc√©e with a song from rent he gets down on one knee after the 5,437 - mile flight and prays for the right answer the happy couple kiss and mr @entity0 's huge trip and elaborate plan have all been worth it mr @entity0 , who had not seen his girlfriend for four months before the proposal , relied on the help of ms @entity1 's close friends and family to pull off the stunt - a group of around 35 all together			1
ms @entity1 was led to @entity70 , where the couple had spent a romantic evening in the past , under the impression that she was there for a marketing job			1
but when she was led outside , an a cappella group start to sing			0
bemused , ms @entity1 says , ' i love this , ' as she watches the group break out into song			1
meanwhile a nervous mr @entity0 hides just a few feet away , preparing himself for one of the most daunting moments of his life			1
as friends of ms @entity1 begin to join the group she starts dancing , still completely oblivious to what is about to happen			1
at this point mr @entity0 bites the bullet and emerges from behind , emerging in time to sing the final verse of his song			2
happy couple : the pair have not set a wedding date yet , but after such an elaborate proposal , ms @entity1 wants to plan a more ' intimate ' ceremony speaking to her after the music stops , he says : ' i have travelled 5,437 miles to stand here before you today , but i would travel to the ends of the universe to be with you			1
' every minute without you has been an eternity , and every bumpy plane ride has been an absolute pleasure			0
' you are the most beautiful , funny , thoughtful , and inspiring woman i have ever known , and i ever will know			0
' you are my soulmate , my partner , my best friend , and you would make me the happiest man alive if you would give me the honour of sharing your life with me			0
' mr @entity0 then gets down on one knee and pops the question , to which ms @entity1 says yes as the crowd break into applause			1
' months of planning all hinged on that moment , and the excitement and elation we all felt at its success was something i 'll never experience again , ' @entity0 recalled			2
' it was the best moment of my life			0
' i was really nervous as months of planning had gone into that moment and i wanted to make it like a dream come true for her			0
' she told me one of her wishes was to find herself in a musical scenario in her life and i wanted to make that happen for her			0
' the happy couple have not set a wedding date yet , but after such an elaborate proposal , ms @entity1 says they would like to ' plan something intimate and unique , ' about a year from now .			1
