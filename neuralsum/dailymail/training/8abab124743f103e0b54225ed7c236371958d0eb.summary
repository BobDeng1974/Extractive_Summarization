‘ our source says that @entity1 is hesitant about launching the @entity46 in the spring of 2015 without a new @entity2 to go along with it , ’ explained mr @entity19			1

’ the news comes as manufacturers revealed @entity1 has plans to kill off its @entity28 as early as next summer			1
amidst the furore of the @entity2 launch in september , @entity1 silently killed off its @entity57			1
but it was n't a drop in sales that brought about its demise , according to boss @entity62 , instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts			0
speaking at the @entity66 conference , mr @entity62 said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player			0
and although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years , sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin			0
mr @entity62 added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts , but it would n't have been cost - effective and would have involved a ' massive ' task			0
launching a phone in spring would mean there was still the same number of handsets in the range once the @entity28 was discontinued			2

the news comes as manufacturers revealed @entity1 has plans to kill off its @entity28 next summer			1
sales of the @entity28 ( pictured at launch with @entity1 executive @entity128 ) were lower than expected			1
launching a phone in spring would mean there was still the same number of handsets in the range once the @entity28 was discontinued when @entity1 ’s online store came back online following its @entity2 event in september , this later model was missing from the @entity57 lineup			1
@entity1 did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time			2
@entity1 boss @entity62 later said the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts , but it would n't have been cost - effective and would have involved a ' massive ' task			0
