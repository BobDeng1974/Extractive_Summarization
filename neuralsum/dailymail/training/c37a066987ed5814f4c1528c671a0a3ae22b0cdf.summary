by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor pressure is mounting on @entity3 over claims he is too biased against the @entity5 to remain as @entity6			0
an anonymous commons motion is already circulating in @entity8 demanding he go after failing to ‘ live up to the tradition of impartiality ’ of his predecessors			1
now outgoing commons clerk , sir @entity14 , has pointedly highlighted that the ' really remarkable powers ' mr @entity3 enjoys depend on him being fair to all political parties			1
a @entity18 motion has been drafted accusing @entity3 of failing to ‘ live up to the tradition of impartiality ’ of his predecessors , and demanding an immediate search for a replacement sir @entity22 is standing down as clerk of the @entity18 , ending a 42 - year parliamentary career he added : ‘ so this clerk will be sorely missed by the @entity26 and by me			1
we do n’t know why he has chosen to retire early , though his working environment behind closed doors has not always been easy , as those in the know have already alluded			0
’ criticism of mr @entity3 has mounted in recent weeks , after he has appeared to repeatedly mock @entity33 in the @entity18 and faced accusations of being rude to staff			2
aides to the speaker were forced to deny claims made in the @entity18 chamber that part of the reason for sir @entity14 's early retirement was he had been told to ' f * * * off ’ by mr @entity3			1
in an interview with @entity46 , sir @entity14 refuses to be drawn on the state of strained relations with the speaker			1
he said : ' we give advice in confidence , and the other side of that coin is that personal relationships are also in confidence			0
' were that not so , we would start to breakdown the relationship of trust that rightly exists between officers of the house and the @entity63			0
wherever you start to break that trust down , you do the relationship damage			0
' but in a thinly - veiled swipe at mr @entity3 , amid swirling rumours of plots to oust him being bein too pro-labour , sir @entity14 added : ' all i can say is that historically , the @entity26 has given the speaker , the chair , really remarkable powers and that rests on the tradition of impartiality and being a servant of the house , something which dates back to @entity80 in the 18th century			1
' i think i would leave that there as a statement of the relationship between the speaker and the @entity26			2
' senior @entity5 mps are privately plotting how to remove mr @entity3 from his post after the next election			2
even some @entity89 frontbenchers are ' fed up ' with his patronising manner during debates , and are unhappy at the way he has berated some of their own mps			0
the anonymous letter is thought to have been sent to several mps and journalists in @entity8 one of the most bizarre exchanges came this week , as mr @entity33 took questions during a lengthy sessions on @entity102 and the @entity104 atrocity			2
mr @entity3 interrupted proceedings to say : ‘ somebody asked how long the statement would run , but i would just point out , if i may , that there is intense interest in it and that the frequency of the prime minister ’s tennis playing on the one hand and his jogging regime on the other means that he is quite fit enough , i am sure			0
’ a draft commons motion , seen by @entity1 , has been circulated in @entity8 in an attempt to step up pressure on the 51 - year - old to quit			1
@entity5 mp @entity121 last week accused mr @entity3 of telling the @entity122 sir @entity14 to ' f * * * off ' the @entity124 criticising mr @entity3 has not been formally tabled , and does not appear to have been signed			1
it states : ‘ this @entity26 regrets that the speaker has failed to live up to the tradition of impartiality established by his predecessors ; notes his increasingly erratic behaviour ; condemns his systematic bullying and humiliation of staff , which has no place in modern society , and especially not in a @entity8 which should set a national example ; and therefore resolves to proceed immediately to the election of a new speaker , in which he shall not be a candidate			1
’ a similar motion was used by @entity5 mp @entity143 to help to unseat the last speaker , @entity89 mp @entity144 , in june 2009			2
@entity5 mp @entity121 , who denies being behind the letter , said at the weekend : ‘ @entity8 deserves better than hot - headed , unpredictable and foul - mouthed @entity3			1
' the sooner we get a new speaker , the better			0
@entity3 should go , ’ he wrote in the @entity148			0
it followed his claim in the commons that mr @entity3 swore at sir @entity14			1
the speaker immediately denied the allegation about sir @entity14 , saying : ‘ i ’ll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong			1
’ but mr @entity121 stood by the claim , declaring he does not believe things should be ‘ swept under the carpet ’			0
earlier this year mr @entity3 tried to humiliate mr @entity33 in the @entity18 by cutting him off mid-sentence			0
during raucous exchanges at @entity113 's questions , mr @entity33 was shouted down by @entity63 and interrupted by mr @entity3			0
as the @entity113 tried to protest that he had not finished , the speaker hit back : ' he can take it from me that he is finished			0
' last year relations reached such a low that @entity63 designed badges with three bees pictured , to show they were members of the @entity170 club : ‘ @entity171 * * * * ed by @entity3 ’ .			2
