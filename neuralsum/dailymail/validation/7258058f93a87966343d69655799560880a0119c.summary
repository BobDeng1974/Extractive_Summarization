the money keeps growing but the odds are shortening as the richest fight of all time looks set to break the half - billion - dollar barrier			1
both @entity5 and @entity6 are impressing video - watchers and hand - picked visitors to their gyms in @entity10 and @entity11 respectively with their dedication and work rate			1
but a dramatic improvement in the speed and power of the @entity6 ’s sparring and pad - hitting in the ring have caught the eye of the so - called ‘ smart money ’ gamblers			1
@entity5 's fight with @entity6 on may 2 is set to break the half - billion - dollar barrier @entity6 , who was a 3/1 shot when betting opened , is now down to 2/1 at best			1
@entity5 , a red - hot odds - on favourite at 2/7 at the start has cooled to 2/3			1
some vegas casinos are predicting what they call a ‘ pick ‘ em ’ even money fight come the big night on may 2			2
our best tip at the moment : if you fancy @entity5 get someone to place your bet in @entity36			2
if you want to back @entity6 , try @entity10			2
an improvement in @entity6 's sparring in the ring has seen ' smart money ' gamblers backing him @entity42 – who was disgracefully accused of running scared of @entity43 – has added the most feared pound - for - pound puncher in the world to his list of potential opponents			1
@entity48 , the killer @entity49 who knocks out opponents for fun , is in the @entity54 ’s line of fire if a fight can not be made with @entity56 at @entity58 's football ground or @entity59 in @entity10 @entity42 has added @entity48 , the killer @entity49 , to his list of potential opponents @entity48 has made it clear he is willing to venture to @entity61 while also stepping up a division and just in case @entity43 ’s loose - tongued advisors would like to know , if all goes well for both of them this summer @entity42 would be open to fighting his fellow @entity67 thereafter			1
@entity43 meets @entity68 in @entity69 in may for the @entity71 title vacated by @entity42 , who beat the @entity72 in @entity61			2
@entity42 says : ‘ @entity43 has not yet proved himself for a fight with me but if he can beat @entity68 it would become more interesting for me to face him			1
but not before a big name fight this summer			0
’ @entity43 fights @entity68 - who @entity42 beat in @entity61 - for the @entity71 title in @entity69 in may while @entity77 and @entity78 are talking about fighting any and every name in the welterweight division – except each other as far as @entity77 is concerned - world super-middleweight champion @entity42 holds an additional option not yet open to these of his countrymen			1
that possibility may be a little more tempting following the offer of a bit part ‘ as a villain or a tough guy ’ in a gangster movie			0
but he will not exercise the glove - hanging alternative – at 37 – if he can find ‘ a fight which floats my boat			2
’ @entity78 , who defeated @entity96 on saturday , has spoken of fighting names in the welterweight division @entity56 has come into that category after the @entity100 ordered their two super-middleweight belt holders to meet for a second time to decide which of them is the real champion			2
the @entity72 who calls himself @entity56 became one of only two men to have beaten @entity42 when he won the final of the @entity110 tournament – and the only one against whom the @entity54 has not avenged a defeat			0
having been outpointed in that fight in the @entity72 , @entity42 is challenging @entity56 to come to the @entity114 in @entity61 , saying : ‘ we ’ve boxed once in @entity72 so it ’s his turn to come over here , where he will find i ’m a different animal			1
’ @entity56 , a notoriously reluctant traveller , is making baulking noises about crossing the @entity122 even as @entity42 ’s promoter @entity123 says : ‘ we are in negotiations with his people			0
’ @entity56 , pictured left with @entity128 earlier this year , is a notoriously reluctant traveller @entity130 is committed to an interim fight next month , after which talks will resume for a fight in @entity10 , the other venue which would realise a life - long ambition for @entity42			1
if neither @entity56 nor @entity130 take the bait , world middleweight champion @entity48 has made clear his willingness to venture into @entity61 while also stepping up a division to super-middle			0
@entity48 ’s punching power has become fabled , while the eagerness of other top middleweights to duck him has become shameful			0
our own @entity144 bravely met the challenge in @entity147 last month			0
he was stopped for the first time in his career , victim of the 29th ko inflicted by @entity48 in a perfect record of 32 wins			2
@entity59 , pictured against @entity154 , is committed to an interim fight next month @entity48 defeated @entity144 ( left ) , victim of the @entity49 's 29th ko , to maintain his perfect win record to which @entity42 has said to @entity123 : ‘ everyone says he ’s a big puncher			1
do you think he hits hard enough to hurt me ? maybe we should find out			0
’ @entity42 is back in training and already only seven pounds over his 12 - stone fighting weight			2
@entity123 says : ‘ @entity42 ’s crazy like that			0
almost everyone else avoids @entity48 like poison but it ’s the kind of challenge which excites @entity42			1
wow what a tough fight and i ’m glad it would n’t be me getting in the ring with him			0
but we ’re still talking with @entity56 and @entity130			0
@entity42 is back in training and facing @entity48 would excite the 37 - year - old , according to @entity123 ‘ @entity42 would consider @entity43 if he wins the world title but that ’s not an easy fight for @entity43			1
’ @entity123 adds : ‘ of course @entity42 could retire now			0
he ’s worked hard and ducked no - one to get into this position			0
so he ’s earned every right to make whatever decision he wants			0
’ that he most certainly has .			0

@entity6 has caught the eye of ' smart money ' gamblers *...* he was a 3/1 shot when betting opened , but now he is down to 2/1
@entity5 and @entity6 set to meet in the richest fight of all time
@entity5 started as the red - hot favourite but has now cooled to 2/3
