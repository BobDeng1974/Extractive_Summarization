ask @entity0 about the most memorable victories in his career and quickly revealed are two aspects of his character — the modest and the contrarian			1
there is no mention of ending @entity9 ’s @entity8 men ’s singles drought , nor the similar emulating of @entity11 at the @entity12 , nor the flaying he gave @entity14 on @entity15 to win the @entity16			2
instead , he refers to a win over an obscure journeyman ranked no 110 in the world , and another at a now - defunct and largely - forgotten tournament in @entity21			1
@entity0 warms up for match against @entity23 in @entity24 on monday the subject arises because he has the opportunity to win a 500th professional singles match on tuesday , when he takes on @entity29 ’s world no 15 @entity23 in the fourth round of the @entity31			1
it comes around nearly 12 years after making his professional debut as a 15 - year - old in @entity35			1
he began with a victory over @entity37 , another @entity29			1
@entity37 was only just outside the top 100 at the time , so it was a fair indication of his opponent ’s outstanding promise			2
@entity0 does not mention that one , but recalls two of the matches that set him on his way , and most clearly the period when he was trying to establish himself on the main @entity45			1
‘ i remember certain wins , like the first one i had at @entity49 ’s ( at the then @entity50 in 2005 ) against @entity51 , ’ he says , referring to the then world no 110			2
‘ it might seem irrelevant now but at the time , for me , that was huge			2
it was big for my confidence , gave me a sense of belonging			0
i really remember those first few events on the tour , more than some of those in the last three or four years			1
coach @entity61 takes a photo of @entity0 during practice session ‘ i can remember the players i played against around then			1
i went to @entity65 ( @entity66 ) after my first @entity8 and then i played in @entity67 and @entity68			0
’ by the end of that summer , not long after turning 18 , he was already knocking on the door of the top 100 and had beaten three players inside the top 30			0
early in 2006 comes the other match he picks out , the final of the indoor @entity76 , where he beat former @entity8 champion @entity77			0
‘ that was a first @entity45 title for me and was really important , ’ he says			0
‘ i was without a coach , only 18 , and @entity77 was someone i loved watching growing up			0
to win 7 - 6 in the third set at that age against someone as good as him , with no coach there , privately meant a lot			2
‘ i did n’t really feel the pressure — it was , “ here i am , i ’m 18 and playing an @entity87 1 in the world , a great player and nothing is expected ”			0
‘ i played ( @entity0 ) @entity91 in the semis and did n’t feel nervous at all			1
it definitely changes over the years , you start to feel the expectation but then as you get older it changes again as you start to deal with the expectation and learn how to handle it			2
’ @entity0 takes time out to signs autographs for fans in @entity24 on monday interestingly , ask which win took the most out of him and he instead cites one of his 155 defeats , the near five - hour loss in the @entity105 semi-final to @entity107			1
the @entity108 subsequently managed probably the most talked about recovery in history , beating @entity111 two days later in nearly six hours to win the title			0
‘ @entity113 in the @entity114 was the hardest match , i ’ve no idea how he managed to recover and win the final			0
i literally could n’t walk for four days			0
that was the match my body hurt the most after finishing			0
i was extremely sore , stiff , everything hurt			0
’ @entity0 is guaranteed to overtake @entity111 in next week ’s rankings after his defeat on sunday by @entity123			1
the @entity124 heads to @entity125 to begin what is usually a triumphant roll through the @entity129 clay courts admitting he is lacking confidence and that he ‘ needs to fix again ’ the nerves that have affected him this season			0
the 28 - year - old insisted there are no hidden physical issues behind his modest 15 - 5 record this year			1
normally the mere feel of the dirt under his feet imbues @entity111 with belief , and with @entity107 targeting @entity141 above all else this year , he will need all of that .			2

@entity0 takes on @entity23 in fourth round at @entity31
the *27* - year - old @entity146 recorded his 499th victory against @entity148
it comes nearly 12 years after making his professional debut as 15 - year - old
