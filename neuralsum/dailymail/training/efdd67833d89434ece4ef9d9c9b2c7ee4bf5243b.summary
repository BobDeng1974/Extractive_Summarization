by @entity0 published : 14:45 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 14:45 est , 31 august 2012 demands : @entity3 leader @entity2 has called for an overhaul of the country 's military hardware @entity2 has ordered the modernisation of @entity3 's armaments on the same scale as achieved by @entity10 at the height of his reign of terror			1
the @entity14 leader made clear he was tired of @entity16 jibes about the country 's outdated firepower as displayed at annual @entity20 parades			1
he is even thought to have reference the former dictators era as he told top security officials : ' we must modernise our defence industry as comprehensively as it was done in the 1930s			2
' he rapped his defence chiefs for failing to draw up plans to meet his ambitious demands for a giant leap forward in @entity3 's military capability which has slipped since the end of the @entity33			2
@entity10 developed @entity35 firepower in the 1930s after revolutionising the country 's outmoded tsarist - era industry			1
but his ruthless state - controlled campaign was based on repression on a grand scale by the secret police and use of slave labour			2
outdated : @entity2 has become angry at the state of defence technology , which go on show every year during the parade in @entity20 @entity2 has committed @entity3 to spending £ 450 billion on a massive armaments programme in the next decade , a modernisation that will include 400 ballistic missiles , 600 warplanes and a new fleet of state - of - the - art submarines			1
as when @entity10 began the process , it is far from certain that @entity3 's defence industries can cope with the demands of matching @entity16 models at a cost - effective price			1
at a well - flagged meeting of the @entity62 , @entity2 blasted ministers for failing to draw up plans to meet his targets			0
@entity10 : the demands made by @entity2 compare the modernisation programmes launched under @entity10 ' i still have not received your proposals			1
they are simply not there , ' fumed the @entity3 president			0
' if this continues , we will never be able to make procurements on time			0
' he even threatened to inject private enterprise into defence plants that have been under strict state control since @entity10 's time			1
he said : ' we have to break down old stereotypes of the type that say only specialised state companies and agencies can involve themselves in defence			0
' highlighting his impatience on the subject , he added : ' within short deadlines we should upgrade production funds and carry out technological modernisation at enterprises in the defence industry			2
' @entity2 admitted that @entity3 manufacturers had failed to keep pace over the past three decades and even acknowledged @entity3 may require foreign technology in order to catch up			0
potential for partnership : @entity2 , seen here with @entity103 prime minister @entity102 , has said that foreign partnerships should be considered ' foreign partnership is possible , " he said , adding it was ' not shameful ' to draw on overseas experience			0
' but creating plants which assemble the analogues of foreign arms and hardware using imported component parts is unacceptable , ' he insisted			0
western military experts have in recent years regularly decried that lack of modern @entity3 firepower shown at the annual @entity20 parade on may 9 marking the end of the @entity118 .			0

has ordered the overhaul after jibes from the @entity122
committed to spending a massive £ 450 billion
