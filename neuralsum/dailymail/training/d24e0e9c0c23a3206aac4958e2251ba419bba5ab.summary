by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:31 est , 7 february 2014 thousands of rail travellers are being forced to pay double for their journeys to and from the stricken @entity6 as a major rail firm withdraws its ‘ advance purchase ’ discount tickets in the wake of storm damage chaos			1
but @entity12 denies ‘ profiteering ’ and insists the action on services @entity15 of @entity16 and some connected routes was unavoidable following storms which caused the line at @entity20 in @entity21 to collapse into the sea			1
as another @entity26 storm sweeps in , @entity24 say it will take ‘ at least six weeks ’ to re-open the @entity20 line			1
thousands of rail travellers are being forced to pay double for their journeys to and from the stricken @entity6 waves undermine the main @entity37 to @entity39 rail line , used by thousands of travellers			0
the route may be out of action for months while it is repaired @entity44 workers inspect the main @entity16 to @entity46 railway line that has been closed due to parts of it being washed away by the sea at @entity20 the ticket move emerged after regular peak - time travellers who book well ahead for a heavily discounted ‘ advance ’ ticket on a specified train found they were unable to do so			1
a full - price ‘ anytime ’ single ticket from @entity55 costs £ 142 , while a pre-booked ‘ advance ’ ticket may be half that			1
but @entity12 , which runs 1,500 services and carries around a quarter of a million passengers daily , said it had been forced to withdraw the discounted tickets because they applied to specific time - tabled trains			0
and the engineering work to repair and restore the storm - lashed line at @entity20 means that they can not guarantee which services will run			1
so they have withdrawn the discounted book - ahead tickets until they can guarantee a ‘ robust ’ timetable , which is unlikely to be before next week			2
one regular commuter who travels peak - time to @entity74 on a @entity12 service from @entity76 in @entity77 with the added benefit of a senior rail discount said : ‘ i get an @entity81 ticket which costs me £ 27.85			1
‘ this morning i booked the same service for this coming monday and found there were no @entity81 tickets available – it was only possible to buy a full fare ticket for £ 63.70			1
‘ initially i wondered whether for some reason there was heavy demand and i had simply left it late to book , but i checked prices for the next monday – february 17 - and it is the same			0
no @entity81 tickets available - only the full fare at £ 63.70			2
so effectively the fare has doubled			0
’ the full anytime single - without the senior rate discount costs £ 96.50			1
a @entity12 spokesman confirmed : ‘ with damage to the rail infrastructure at @entity20 , we have had to temporarily suspend reservations			2
put simply , we can not sell a cheaper , time specific , reserved seat if we are unable to guarantee the delivery of that service			0
‘ once we have a full and robust train plan in place , to operate services west of @entity16 we will restart sales of @entity109 tickets			0
’ however , because the fares have to be updated in the national fares booking system ‘ these may not be available until the early part of next week ’			0
with high tides combined with gale force winds and further heavy rain , some parts of the @entity116 are bracing themselves for more flooding damage along the beach and coastline in @entity123 at @entity125 head he said : ’ ’ the cost of our peak time and off peak fares has not altered since the government 's inflation - based fare increase in january			0
‘ within the last two weeks however , due to @entity24 maintenance work , and latterly due to substantial damage of the railway infrastructure at @entity20 , there has been amendments to the availability of reserved , @entity109 tickets			1
’ @entity12 said that to help customers travel during the disruption it has removed all ticket restrictions for travel west of @entity16 : ‘ this allows customers with existing @entity109 , or off - peak tickets , to travel on any available service including peak time trains for no extra cost			2
’ this does not however help those passengers who want to book ahead now for a future discounted peak - time advance on a specified service			2
they will have to pay full fare if they want to ensure they can get onto a peak - time train			0
but the rail firm did pledge to refund the tickets of anyone forced to pay full - price if a cheaper advance ticket subsequently becomes available : ‘ should a customer buy an off peak fare , for example to travel next thursday , and a cheaper @entity109 ticket become available on tuesday or wednesday , we will refund the cost of the off peak fare			1
' view of the railway line at @entity20 , @entity21 , which has been left hanging in mid-air after the sea wall was washed away he said : ‘ we hope to have a robust train plan in place over the course of the weekend			1
further poor weather prevents us from doing this on thursday of friday			0
once we have this , we can restart sales of advance purchase tickets			0
’ services from @entity76 are affected because that train route runs down towards @entity16 and beyond to the @entity20 area , he said			2
@entity24 ’s route managing director for the @entity188 route said : ‘ we absolutely understand the importance of the railway to the @entity191 and we will do everything we can to re-build the railway at @entity20 as quickly and safely as we can			1
’ @entity194 , head of policy for consumer watchdog @entity196 said : ‘ we appreciate the difficulties these storms have created for the rail industry			0
however , passengers wanting to travel to and from @entity21 and @entity39 are facing a double disadvantage ' not only do they face the delay itself , but they also have to pay much more to travel than usual			0
with extreme weather become more frequent the industry needs to address this issue			0

following storms which caused line at @entity20 in @entity21 to collapse into sea
@entity24 say it will take ‘ at least six weeks ’ to re-open @entity20 line
full - price ‘ anytime ’ single ticket from @entity55 costs £ 142
a pre-booked ‘ advance ’ ticket may be half that - but they *'re* *unavailable*
