a supermarket is offering shoppers ' free erections ' after a sign was wrongly translated into welsh a supermarket is offering shoppers ' free erections ' after a sign was wrongly translated into @entity4			1
the sign on a cash machine at the @entity12 store in @entity13 should read ' arian am ddim ' which means free money			1
but the supermarket blundered by saying ' codiad am ddim ' which means free erections			1
the error was seen by @entity4 speaking @entity13 councillor @entity21 who said : ' there were a few titters in the town so i went down to have a look myself			1
' ten out of ten to @entity12 for considering the @entity4			1
' but perhaps they should have had it checked by an actual @entity4 speaker before putting the signs on the machines			1
' people get their @entity4 translations wrong from time to time but this one is hilarious			1
' managers at the @entity37 in the university town took the sign down and were investigating the mistake			2
but shoppers believe the supermarket used @entity43 to translate - and got it badly wrong			0
@entity44 , 18 , whose girlfriend works at the new store , said : ' i am not sure how they came up with because anyone with a basic understanding of @entity4 would know it is the wrong word			1
' they must have used @entity43 translate			0
' i think it 's quite funny but i know some people might be offended they did n't bother to check they had got it right			0
' the @entity12 social media team saw the funny side of the incident , tweeting : ' we â€™ve taken down the sign and will replace it with the correct translation			0
we appreciate this is a sensitive area			0
' in 2010 @entity63 sent an email to its in - house translations service to have a road sign - ' no entry for heavy goods vehicles			2
residential site only ' - translated into @entity4			1
the only problem was that the @entity4 translator was n't in at the time			2
an automated email response was sent to council officials who believed it was exactly what they needed			0
but in fact it stated : ' i am not in the office at the moment			0
send any work to be translated			0
' unaware of the real meaning of the message , authorities had it printed on the road sign under the @entity87			0
a council spokesman said the sign was removed as soon as it was notified of the blunder			2
managers at the @entity37 in @entity93 took the sign down and were investigating the mistake			0

sign should read ' arian am ddim ' which means free money
instead it said : ' codiad am ddim ' - or free erections
