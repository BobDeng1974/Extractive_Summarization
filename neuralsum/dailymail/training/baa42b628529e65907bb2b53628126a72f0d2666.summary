’ mr @entity103 , a haulage contractor , said they struggled to get help from their travel insurance so were forced to pay for hotels and medical bills and claim it back later			0
he added : ‘ i had to transfer our savings to the hospital … the insurance company was taking too long			0
’ mrs @entity7 was one of many passengers who the family say fell ill on the ship – which has been accused of inflicting the ‘ @entity11 cough ’ on some of its customers			1
mr @entity103 said they noticed fellow travellers coughing within days of the cruise starting on january 6			0
toast : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity143 ( right ) celebrated as the ship set sail from @entity36 ‘ we all picked up this cough but @entity7 ’s gradually became more profound , ’ he said			2

the family then faced the ordeal of getting to @entity37 where they could fly home			1
mrs @entity40 said : ‘ we had to find , book and pay for the transport ourselves			0
my poor mother had to go from taxi to coach to plane to taxi … it was a huge upheaval and incredibly draining			0
’ once they arrived on january 30 they planned to stay at the @entity187 where they had a four - night stay booked within the cruise package which also included their flights			1
‘ we thought it was all booked but @entity2 had cancelled the hotel and the flights because @entity7 , @entity196 and @entity25 had left the ship , ’ mr @entity103 said			2
‘ they then refused to help us rearrange them … we had to find the money to pay for flights and a hotel again even though we had already paid for it all			0
’ the family managed to get flights but while waiting to travel home , mrs @entity7 died in her hotel room on january 31			1
‘ the doctors said it looked like a cardiac arrest , ’ mrs @entity40 said			0
' forced off ' : mrs @entity7 , pictured with her husband on a cruise in 2013 , used to run a greetings card shop			1
she was taken to a private hospital in @entity5 that demanded $ 15,000 upfront to start treatment ‘ the trauma and upheaval had been too much … our doctor saw her records and said there was no reason for her to come off that ship … i believe she would be here today if it was n’t for the cough and how @entity2 treated her			1
