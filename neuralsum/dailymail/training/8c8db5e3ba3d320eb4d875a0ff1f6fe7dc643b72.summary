by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 09:53 est , 21 september 2012 @entity1 gained over 57,000 new @entity3 followers during @entity4 , topping every other designer as the most talked about collection on the social media site			1
@entity8 followed , but not closely , with 8,813 mentions , while designers @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 took the remaining three popularity spots respectively			1
on the heels of conversation surrounding the overuse of @entity3 during @entity4 , with popular thought being that it is stripping all intellect , wit and reflection of the collections with the increasingly fast - paced , and real - time tweets , it seems the designers are n't hurting at all			2
@entity3 superstar : @entity1 gained nearly 58,000 @entity3 followers during @entity4 , topping every other designer as the most mentioned collection on the social media site @entity30 - based social media agency @entity29 analyzed layers of @entity3 algorithms during @entity4 to identify the most popular designers , trends , and hashtags associated with the last week 's spring 2013 collections			1
hosted a runway show rather than her usual small presentation for the first time , former the former @entity1 successfully slaughtered all other designers in the social media marketing arena during @entity4			2
this may have had something to do with her tweet of @entity47 , her toddler daughter , waddling down the runway just hours before the designer 's show started			1
lagging behind : @entity8 ( left ) followed for second place with 8,813 mentions ; designer @entity10 ( right ) , @entity11 and @entity12 took the remaining three popularity spots respectively @entity8 , coming in at number two , had popular fashion blogger @entity55 of the @entity56 democratically hosting his collection livestream to the public , and the number three , @entity10 , surprised everyone with her @entity62 glasses , which walked down the runway on the models and the designer herself			1
@entity12 - 14,300 the number of tweets associated with @entity4 , or # nyfw , doubled since last year 's spring collections , with a total of 671,028 @entity4 mentions			0
the @entity73 was the top country tweeting about the collections , designers and general goings on , taking up 72per cent of the total @entity4 @entity3 pie			1
in comparison , the next @entity4 @entity3 - centric country was the @entity80 , tweeting only five per cent of the overall mentions			0
enabling designers , stylists , photographs and journalists alike to turn the once media and buyer - specific week into an onslaught of mass self - promotion , street style overkill , and slightly strange endorsements more than ever before , it 's clear @entity3 and its zealous account users have no plans of slowing down , much to the pleasures of designer 's marketing teams everywhere			2
