by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 30 september 2013 three times the residents of a small town had seen off the might of @entity4			1
so when @entity7 ’s biggest retailer returned for a fourth go at putting a supermarket in their high street , the residents knew they had a real fight on their hands			2
for 25 years the people of @entity14 in @entity15 had put up posters , written letters and held marches to stop the retailer installing itself in the town			0
shopkeepers had warned that the arrival of a supermarket would destroy the town by undercutting their traditional shops and forcing them to close			1
but when @entity4 announced yet again it was planning to build a supermarket in the historic wool town , where 92 per cent of buildings are listed , the residents decided there was only one way to take on the mighty retailer			1
@entity4 protestors ( left to right ) @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 celebrated beating off supermarket giant @entity4 's bid to open a store in their traditional market town threat : campaigners who want to protect the @entity42 of @entity14 in @entity15 have fought off @entity4 again in the latest set - to in a 25 - year battle instead of organising a new petition or preparing placards , the town pulled together to raise an impressive £ 80,000 war chest – made up of donations from shopkeepers and individuals – to pay for a team of experts , including a top @entity53			1
@entity54 , 77 , of the @entity55 , said : ‘ we realised we could no longer just argue as amateurs			0
it was made clear to us that the local council was only going to take notice of professionals			2
‘ it seems ridiculous to have to pour big money into it , and for a small town to raise that kind of sum , but we did it			0
it shows the strength of feeling about the prospect of @entity4 moving in			1
’ a small team of retired residents in the town – described by poet sir @entity73 as ‘ one of the most perfect small towns in @entity76 ’ – pored over every word of the supermarket ’s application			2
they then commissioned professional reports to highlight the possible impact the store could have on the town ’s traffic system and its economy			2
seven of the town ’s traders , including the sweetshop , a butcher and a florist , said they would definitely shut if @entity4 won permission for its 2,500 square metre store in the town centre			1
a further seven stores – including the post office , a newsagent and a tile shop , said they would ‘ probably ’ close			0
mrs @entity54 said : ‘ we have a medieval high street with small family shops selling local goods , and we do not want to lose it			1
moment of truth : bosses met at @entity106 to decide on proposals for a @entity4 's in the town ' @entity109 ' : campaigners stood outside with posters to block the move for the fourth time ‘ i want people who can give us a good service and who can tell us where the food has come from			1
‘ we ’ve got two butchers			0
the food is very , very local – they can tell us the farm where the meat is from			0
‘ when everyone was worried about horsemeat , i knew that the beef burgers i bought had come from just up the road			0
’ at a packed council meeting the residents ’ hard work was rewarded when permission for the store was rejected by a single vote			1
@entity134 , planning committee chairman , said : ‘ the impact on the local highway network , the effect on the vitality of the town centre in retail terms and its design and impact on listed buildings were all fundamental to the council ’s decision			0
’ the campaigners greeted the decision with applause			0
long road : the supermarket giant first applied to build a store in 1987 and after several attempts has still failed to get pernission @entity153 , spokesman for the @entity154 , said : ‘ it ’s a victory for the people of @entity14 as it was simply going to destroy the high street , and people come here because of the environment and the independent stores			1
’ @entity4 has not ruled out appealing or putting in a new application , but mrs @entity54 said local people have already got plans for the proposed site , a plot of abandoned warehouses			1
she said : ‘ people are dreaming about what would happen if @entity4 would go away and let us buy the site			2
‘ the one thing we have not got is small retirement units for independent living for people who want to downsize			0
’ @entity4 said many @entity14 residents had supported its project , which , it said , would have brought jobs and more choice to the town			2
@entity4 had planning applications rejected in 1987 and 2000			1
a government inquiry in 2001 rejected an appeal			0
in 2011 a further application was rejected .			0
