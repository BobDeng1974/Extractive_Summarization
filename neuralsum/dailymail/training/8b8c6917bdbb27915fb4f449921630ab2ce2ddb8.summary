@entity0 thought he was destined for a future in the top flight when he was training with @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 at @entity6 as a teenager , under the tutelage of sir @entity9			1
fresh - faced from @entity6 ’s academy , having signed professional terms there at 16 - years - old , he was awestruck when opportunities arose to take part in sessions with the first - team at their @entity18 training facility			1
back then he tried to keep his head down , keep it simple and avoid becoming the butt of their jokes			2
@entity0 in action during spells with former clubs @entity25 and @entity27 little did he know at that stage that his career would take him plummeting down the football pyramid , into the the murky depths of non-league to spells playing abroad in @entity34 and the @entity35 , at times without a club and on the verge of giving it all up			1
but after sticking with it , the 27 - year - old is set to test his ability against @entity43 opposition when his @entity45 face @entity46 in the @entity47			1
‘ @entity6 had probably their best team when i was coming through , ’ @entity0 , a life - long @entity6 fan , explains			1
' when you ’re a youngster with the first team you ’re just trying to get on and do nothing wrong			2
just pass the ball , keep under the radar so they do n’t start coming at you with their banter			2
otherwise you ’re in trouble			2
‘ you make sure you do things right			2
it was great playing with them and seeing their quality			0
but in my second year it was all change , @entity59 came in and @entity67 became academy manager and he released me			1
’ the home of @entity72 side @entity70 will be the venue for the @entity47 game against @entity46 @entity75 , striker , 23 he is on fire at the moment with nine goals in his last 12 games			1
he ’s scoring goals and looking like he ’ll score every game			0
he ’s strong but he ’s pacy at the same time , a real handful			0
he ’ll work for the full 90 minutes and he wo n’t give defenders a rest			0
@entity86 , centre - back , 22 he has led the team really well as stand - in skipper			1
he ’s so strong at the back , solid as a rock , and he popped up with the goal to knock @entity93 out last round			0
@entity95 , goalkeeper , 26 he kept seven clean sheets on the spin at home this season and only conceded two all season in nine games on our turf			0
he ’s been brilliant for us			0
he ’s come on loan from @entity105 , and we could n’t believe he had n’t been playing for them			0
@entity0 admits , frankly , that at 18 his attitude was the key factor in the demise of his career			1
‘ i was immature and clueless , ’ he says			1
‘ @entity67 had me playing left back but i ’m an attacking central midfielder			2
' being so young and at @entity6 i was thinking something else will come up			1
‘ i played up a bit			0
my attitude was the reason they let me go			0
thinking i knew it all was the problem			0
’ @entity128 ’ @entity126 surname – pronounced @entity127 - er - dich – which comes from his grandfather belies the lad who was born and bred in @entity121 and still maintains a thick @entity123 accent despite living in @entity124 now			1
he turned to his local club , in the sixth tier of @entity132 football , when no - one came calling for his services after being ditched by @entity6			1
‘ it was a wakeup call , ’ he says			2
‘ it was like fight football			0
if you ’ve got anything about you they just want to smash you			0
@entity70 will be dreaming of a cup upset against @entity46 at the @entity143 on sunday ‘ it did n’t work out for me , the manager told me he ca n’t play me because the other players were n’t reading what i was trying to do			1
i was giving the ball away because the players were n’t reading the passes i was making			0
’ still a teenager , he tumbled even further down the pyramid and had a brief spell at @entity154 before moving to @entity25 and winning promotion from @entity156 in the last minute of the last game of the season			0
but , like so much of @entity128 ’ career , it went wrong			1
he was finally playing back at a level he felt his ability warranted , in the @entity163 , when @entity25 ’s owner , businessman @entity164 , died after suffering a heart attack and falling into his pond			0
the club ceased to exist after finishing the season and @entity0 was back on the transfer scrap heap			1
this prompted his next move to @entity27 , then in @entity172 , where he played in the same midfield as @entity174 , who he will come up against on sunday			2
‘ he was raw back then , ’ @entity0 remembers			1
‘ he had the skill he has now , he ’d do something with the ball , a movement of quick feet , and you ’d think , “ i could try that 100 times and it ai n’t happening			0
” ‘ he ’s got that bit of ridiculousness			0
he just makes it up on the spot at times , it comes to him a split second earlier than other people think			0
’ in - form @entity46 winger @entity174 is a former team - mate of @entity128 yet while the other three in that midfield of @entity174 and @entity196 , who plays for @entity197 , on the wings and @entity199 , who is now at @entity200 , in the centre , went upwards , @entity0 went down again			1
a pre-season at @entity203 , in the @entity204 , had only meant to be to maintain fitness , but that turned into a whole season and for the first time since he signed professional terms at @entity128 was not playing full - time			1
‘ i scratched my head at how three had gone one way and i went the other , ’ he adds			0
@entity0 needed to get away and flew to @entity34 with @entity213 , the middle brother of @entity214 and @entity215 , where they played for @entity218 in the tiny town of @entity220 with a population of 3,000			1
but though the mountainous scenery where the sun bounced off the fjord every morning was ‘ like something out of a @entity232 movie , you felt like someone was going to parachute over the top , ’ @entity0 was left more shaken than stirred by the poor quality of football and quickly left			1
he tried abroad again at @entity35 club @entity233 , where it was even worse			2
‘ you see lads having kebabs the night before games , or going to pizza shop just before a match , you think , “ what ’s going on ? ” it was an eye - opener , made me realise i needed to back in @entity132 where people take football as seriously as me			2
’ @entity0 was determined not to give up , contrary to the advice of others , staying single to devote his life to football			1
he was lured to a showcase event at the @entity251 with the promise of scouts and agents in attendance			0
@entity70 manager @entity256 looks on during a photo shoot ahead of his side 's match against @entity46 ‘ i turned up and it was absolutely garbage , ’ he recalls			1
‘ i ’d been sold something , told there would be out - of - work former pros there , top quality players , but most of them had never , ever played @entity267			2
kids were turning up who would ’ve done well to get in my school team			0
but there was a little silver lining			0
’ @entity128 ’ current agents picked him up from there			1
when they got him in at @entity70 last july , he had no idea he would be pitting himself against @entity43 opposition so soon			1
‘ they could n’t have got me further away from @entity6 if they tried			2
they might as well have spoken to a few clubs in @entity279 , ’ he jokes			0
‘ there ’ve been plenty of times when people have told me to let it go , but i ’m adamant i ’ve got a point to prove in this country			0
‘ my aim is to get back into the @entity267 , whether it ’s with @entity70 or somewhere else longer - term			2
i ’m genuinely enjoying my football for the first time in a long time			0

@entity0 was on @entity6 's books as a youngster before being released after failing to make the grade
the 27 - year - old admits he was ' immature and clueless ' when he was younger and that led to his demise at @entity298
@entity128 now plies his trade in the @entity72 for @entity301
the midfielder said it was a wake - up call when no - one else wanted him so he offered his services to his local club
@entity0 *harbours* hope of a cup shock when @entity43 outfit @entity46 travel to the @entity143 on sunday
