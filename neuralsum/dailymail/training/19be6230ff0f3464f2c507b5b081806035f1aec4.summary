so it turns out at least one @entity2 team is capable of making smooth , stylish progress in @entity4			2
while many of their rivals have struggled this season , falling down when not expected or shooting themselves in the foot , @entity5 have gone from strength - to - strength			2
thanks to another impressive night at @entity13 , a point separates them from the @entity16 ’s knockout stages			2
@entity18 , of course , will take nothing for granted			2
but after swatting @entity27 aside 3 - 0 , thanks to goals from @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , the only question up for debate is whether @entity5 finish top of @entity29 or as runners - up			1
@entity24 celebrates scoring @entity5 's third goal as they beat @entity27 3 - 0 at home in their @entity16 tie on thursday @entity24 ( right ) crashed home @entity5 's third into the top corner following a pass from @entity38 @entity5 : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity23 , @entity41 , @entity38 , @entity42 ( @entity43 85 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 67 ) , @entity22 , @entity24 , @entity46 ( @entity47 66 ) , @entity48			1

booked : @entity62 , @entity63 referee : @entity75 ( @entity76 ) yet for one of the scorers , another poser needed to be considered			0
‘ we are thoroughly enjoying the @entity82 experience , ’ said @entity23			1
‘ we are determined to stay in the competition for as long as possible			0
can we win it ? why not ? did anyone think @entity86 would get to the final a few years ago ? no. there ’s a long way to go but we are in this competition to win it			0
’ the issue of who finishes top will be decided in @entity93 on november 27 but if @entity5 play with the panache that helped them dismantle the first @entity96 visitors to @entity13 , it will be theirs with a game to spare			0
how a few of @entity18 ’s managerial peers would like to be in such a position			0
initially @entity5 took time to find their stride			2
though @entity48 had a chance after 24 seconds , when his drive beaten away by @entity55 , they could n’t build up a head of steam and , for a period , there were some anxieties			0
yet with @entity44 , @entity42 – the game ’s outstanding performer – and @entity24 all involved , @entity5 kept the ball moving and , eventually , their persistence paid off			1
the breakthrough arrived just before the half - hour			1
it was a fine goal , too			0
@entity48 found @entity42 who swiftly sent @entity46 marauding down the right ; @entity42 carried his run into the area but his compatriot picked out @entity22 , who applied a thumping right foot finish			1
@entity22 is not a player who courts the spotlight but he has had a career of which he can be proud			1
he has devoted his life to @entity5 , squeezed every last ounce of ability from himself and always been there to do a job			0
it is why he has been awarded a new 12 - month contract			2
from the moment that drive nestled in the back of @entity55 ’s net – it was @entity22 ’s first goal since march – there was never any doubt @entity5 would go on to run out authoritative winners and they put clear light between themselves just before half - time thanks to @entity23			1
@entity48 ( left ) sees his shot tipped around the post by @entity27 goalkeeper @entity142 ( right ) in the first half @entity5 midfielder @entity22 broke the deadlock midway through the first half at @entity13 @entity22 ( right ) scored a beautifully struck half - volley inside the @entity27 penalty box in the 27th minute the @entity148 international ( second left ) watches on as his half - volley is too hot to handle for @entity27 goalkeeper @entity55 @entity22 celebrates by crooning to the corner flag as @entity5 take their lead in their @entity29 encounter click here to view our brilliant @entity154 including the move for @entity5 's third goal scored by @entity24 this was a more direct effort – @entity46 ’s outswinging corner finding the captain at the back post , who stooped to guide his header beyond @entity27 captain @entity62 on the back post – but there were no complaints on the touchline from @entity18 , who celebrated with an arm aloft			1
@entity27 briefly threatened to make a fight of things and in the first attack of the second period , @entity174 – who will join @entity176 next summer – tried to show why @entity177 believes he is a “ world class talent ” , with a skipping , jinking run into the area			1
that was to be as good as it got for @entity27			1
@entity5 quickly went back through the gears and @entity48 was denied the third goal of the evening when @entity55 plunged to his left to prevent the @entity188 ’s dipping free - kick nestling in the @entity190 net			2
@entity5 captain @entity23 ( centre right ) doubled his side 's advantage with a header just before half - time the @entity5 skipper ( right ) is all smiles as his goal gives his side a healthy cushion before the interval @entity174 ( left ) failed to impress upfront for @entity27 , rarely troubling the @entity5 defence on thursday night @entity66 's @entity205 international team - mate @entity48 ( left ) was the busier of the two strikers , causing the @entity27 defence a lot of problems @entity5 midfielder @entity42 ( left ) was the standout player during the match at @entity13 @entity38 ( centre ) attempts to dribble his way through the challenge of @entity58 ( left ) and @entity214 any frustration felt then was short lived			1
on the hour , @entity5 launched another rapid break down the left , with @entity38 swapping passes with @entity48 before sweeping in a cross that @entity24 gleefully smashed into the top corner , past the helpless @entity55			1
had they gone through the gears , there could have been more but that was a minor complaint			0
@entity5 ’s grand ambitions have momentum			0
‘ we are a football club that is expected to win things , ’ said @entity18			0
‘ @entity4 is in our dna			0
i thought we played really well			0
what pleased me most is every player is ready to embrace the opportunity of playing in @entity4			0
’ @entity5 boss @entity18 ( left ) will be delighted with his side 's performance as they close in on qualifying for the knockout stages @entity236 not carried away with @entity82 performances the travelling @entity27 supporters were in fine voice throughout the match on @entity241 despite their team 's result			1

@entity22 opened the scoring for the hosts midway through the first half with a sweet right - footed half - volley
@entity23 doubled the hosts advantage against @entity27 before half - time with a header
@entity24 made it 3 - 0 just after the hour mark with an *unstoppable* left - footed strike
