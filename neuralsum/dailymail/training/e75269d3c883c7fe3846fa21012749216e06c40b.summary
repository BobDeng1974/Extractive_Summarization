the flu epidemic continues to rage into the new year with the deadly virus now widespread in 43 @entity3 states - up seven from the previous count			1
according to the @entity6 there have been 21 pediatric deaths this season as a result of the mutated @entity11 strain , with six fatalities in the week of @entity13 alone			1
during this period , there were 7,289 newly diagnosed infections , bringing the total number of cases to 37,938			2
while the rest of the country is on red alert , the @entity33 and @entity34 have been experiencing outbreaks at a ' regional ' level			2
there have been ' sporadic ' incidents in @entity41 and no reports in @entity43 , @entity44 or the @entity45			2
because the flu strain has mutated this year the @entity26 says vaccines currently on the market may be ineffective			1
fever , chills cough , sore throat , runny nose , muscle aches headache @entity54 , nausea source : @entity26 those particularly at risk of illness are those over 65 and children younger than four			1
across the nation , 3,441 people have been hospitalized because of the growing crisis			1
according to the @entity26 , data from 122 @entity3 cities showed deaths from influenza and pneumonia exceeded the national baseline			2
about 96 per cent of flu cases so far this year have been the virulent @entity11 sub-type , the @entity26 reported			2
another state hit hard has been @entity71 , where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year 's flu strain is particularly strong			1
the flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the @entity71 @entity80 have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 per cent of students have been absent in december while battling the illness			1
@entity85 , 17 , from @entity71 , passed away in early december after contracting the flu @entity85 , a 17 - year - old senior at @entity87 in @entity71 died at the @entity88 in early december from the flu			1
initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat , @entity85 deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother 's arms after being sick for one week			1
despite the paramedics and best efforts , she passed away			2
the @entity26 admitted earlier this month that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain , @entity11			1
that strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations , especially in the elderly			1
' though we can not predict what will happen the rest of this flu season , it 's possible we may have a season that 's more severe than most , ' said @entity26 director , dr @entity110			2
@entity26 officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated			1
flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year			2
last winter , flu vaccine was 50 to 55 per cent effective overall , which experts consider relatively good			0
among infectious diseases , flu is considered one of the nation 's leading killers			0
on average , about 24,000 @entity3 die each flu season , according to the @entity26			0
nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter 's flu season			0
ineffective : a man receives a free flu shot from a @entity131 employee during a free flu shot clinic at @entity133 on december 19 , 2014 in @entity134 , @entity32 current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus , depending on the product			1
the ingredients are selected very early in the year , based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter			0
the ingredients always include a @entity145 flu virus			1
the most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug			0
the three most deadly flu seasons of the last ten years - in the winters of 2003 - 2004 , 2007 - 2008 , and 2012 - 2013 - were @entity11 seasons			0
in march , after the @entity11 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway , health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of @entity11			1
' this is not something that 's been around before , ' @entity110 said			0
but health officials were n't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the @entity3 this winter until recently , they said			1
lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of @entity11			1
specifically , about 48 percent of the @entity11 samples seen so far were well matched to what 's in the vaccine , but 52 percent were not , the @entity26 said			0
an official with one vaccine manufacturer - @entity172 - emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine			1
he also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain			1
' we 're at the very beginning of flu season , and it 's quite possible different strains will predominate , ' said dr. @entity186 , director of scientific affairs for @entity172 's vaccines business			0
how bad is this flu season ? it 's not clear yet			0
experts worry this winter will be unusually bad because the nasty bug that 's making most people sick is n't included in this year 's vaccine			1
preliminary data on how well the vaccine is working is still weeks away			0
among infectious diseases , flu is considered one of the nation 's leading causes of death , killing roughly 24,000 a year , on average			0
@entity205 ? the different flu strain makes predictions more difficult			1
the current season hit hard in december - earlier than usual			0
but the last two flu seasons hit early , too			0
so far , flu hospitalization rates are similar to the harsh season two years ago , which was dominated by a similar flu virus			2
especially this year , health officials this year are urging doctors to treat flu patients promptly with antiviral medications			0
@entity217 ? yes , but that 's not unusual			0
' it 's safe to say we have a flu epidemic every year , ' @entity25 said monday			0
epidemics occur when a virus spreads quickly and affects many people at the same time			1
according to one @entity26 definition , flu is epidemic when a certain percentage of deaths in a given week are due to flu and pneumonia			2
by that measure , flu epidemics occurred in nine of the last dozen winters , including this one			0
flu - related deaths surpassed the epidemic threshold three weeks ago , then dropped below that level the next week			2
but other measures indicate flu still is epidemic			0
is it too late to get a @entity242 ? @entity26 officials say no. the flu season appears to be on track to peak this month , but even if it does , the flu will still be around for months			0
despite the new flu strain , the vaccine has been well matched in roughly a third of the flu cases seen so far			2
and it is considered to be effective against some other flu viruses that could surge in the late winter or spring			0
about 40per cent of the public was vaccinated against flu as of november , which is about normal in recent years , @entity25 said .			0
