by @entity1 reporter published : 17:26 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 18:03 est , 7 august 2013 a study out this summer from @entity3 says smokers cost their employers around $ 6,000 per year more than non-smokers			1
researchers led by @entity8 , who will become an assistant professor at the university ’s @entity10 this month , used the findings of previous studies to take a comprehensive look at the financial burden smokers put on their employers			2
coming as no surprise , smoke breaks cost employers the lion ’s share of the six grand , followed by higher healthcare costs , absenteeism , and lower productivity			2
cost defective : an @entity3 researcher has concluded that smokers cost their employers an average of $ 6,000 per year ‘ this research should help businesses make better informed decisions about their tobacco policies , ’ @entity27 said			1
‘ we constructed our calculations such that individual employers can plug in their own expenses to get more accurate estimates of their own costs			2
’ the study came up with some precise numbers for how much absenteeism , lost productivity , smoke breaks and health care cost employers each year			0
on average , smoke breaks cost employers $ 3,077 per year , while the second highest expenditure , health care , costs employers an average of $ 2,056 per year			1
and while absenteeism caused by ill health made up around $ 500 of the costs , ‘ presenteeism ’ — or reduced productivity — accounted for $ 462 of the researchers ’ calculations			0
breakdown : the study , led by researcher @entity8 , came to some very specific dollar amounts about how smokers cost their employers money but not them all : by dying , some retired smokers could could save their employers money by offsetting the pension costs of longer - lived non-smokers @entity66 told , the annual costs could range from $ 2,885 to $ 10,125 per smoker , according to the study			1
some smokers , however , can actually save their employers money the study also found			1
though they have to be dead			0
when a retiree who receives a set amount of pension each year from his or her former employer dies , that employer saves around $ 296			0
this happens because of the difference in lifespan between smokers and non-smokers because the shorter - lived smokers actually help offset pensions of the longer - lived non-smokers			1
meanwhile , @entity27 urged employers not to start fuming right away			0
‘ employers should be understanding about how difficult it is to quit smoking and how much support is needed , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s definitely not just a cost issue , but employers should be informed about what the costs are when they are considering these policies			0

an @entity3 researcher *compiled* data from other studies to determine exact costs to employers
for retiree smokers , dying could save their employers money by offsetting the pension costs of longer - lived non-smokers
