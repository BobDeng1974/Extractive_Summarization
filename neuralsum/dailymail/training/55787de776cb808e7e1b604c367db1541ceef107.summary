they live in one of the most hostile places on @entity3 , where the ground is littered with black volcanic rocks and daytime temperatures regularly soar to 45 degrees @entity7			1
but for the people of the @entity11 tribe , this lunar landscape is home			1
more than two days drive from @entity14 capital @entity15 and bordered by @entity16 to the north and @entity18 to the east , 250,000 people eke out a living from their cattle on the shores of the mighty @entity11			1
yet despite living in one of the remotest and most inhospitable places on the planet , photographer @entity24 , the man behind these incredible images , says the people are welcoming - and have a fascinating array of traditions , not least their habit of celebrating the passage to adulthood with a liberal application of dung			2
striking : a @entity11 woman shows off her beaded collar			2
the red colour of her skin comes from a mix of ochre , butter and perfume which is used instead of water to bath beads : all women wear beads , with men refusing to look at them if they fail to do so			1
they never take them off unless they 're ill or in mourning for a relative beautiful : both men and women wear the @entity11 's trademark nakaparaparal or earrings , which are made exclusively by the men using aluminium important : for @entity11 men , ostrich feathers are a sign of adulthood and are thus hugely expensive - two ostrich feathers are worth the same as a goat to the tribe ' to become a man , a @entity11 teenager must go through a ceremony where he has to kill an animal with a spear in one throw , ' explains @entity24			1
' once done , the elders will open the stomach of the animal and smear all the dung on his body - it 's their way of blessing him			2
' and the @entity11 tribe 's uses for poo are n't limited to initiation rites			1
with little wood to be found , most of the cooking is done over fires made from dried cow dung , while dog poo is used both as a medicine and as a lubricant to keep the tribe 's elaborate bead necklaces from chafing the neck			1
' women put animal fat all around their neck and also on their huge necklaces to prevent skin irritation , ' reveals @entity24			1
' they also use dog poo as a medicine and as a lubricant for their necks			1
' but it 's animal fat that holds the most value for the @entity11 , who along with using it as both food and medicine , also use it as a substitute for water when it comes to keeping clean			1
protective : women of the @entity11 tribe use animal fat mixed with ochre to protect their skin and use either animal fat or dog poo to stop their necklaces from chafing adults : women are considered adults as soon as they hit puberty but boys have to go through an initiation ritual before they are considered men family affair : fathers give children different jobs depending on their age with boys in charge of herding while girls do things like collecting firewood and water initiation rite : boys of the @entity11 tribe are n't considered men until they have killed an animal with a single spear throw , after which dung is smeared over their bodies ' since water is so rare , it ’s used only for drinking and never for washing , ' says @entity24			1
' instead , the @entity11 clean themselves by rubbing fat or butter all over their skin			1
' turkana women follow it up with grease paint which they make by mixing animal fat with red ochre and fragrant leaves from one of the local trees			1
they say it 's good for the skin and it protects them from the insects			0
' teeth , meanwhile , are cared for using twigs from the esekon tree			0
' you see them using it all day long , ' adds @entity24			0
' the @entity11 people have the cleanest bill of dental health in the country			2
' although the @entity11 prize their esekon trees and impressively large herds of sheep and cattle , wealth is revealed via elaborate beaded jewellery which the tribe value above everything else			1
' @entity11 women love to adorn themselves with a lot of necklaces , ' says @entity24			1
' beads can be made from glass , seeds , cowry shells or iron			0
they do n't remove their necklaces unless they are ill or mourning a relative - they even sleep in them			2
' married women will also wear a plain metal ring around the neck , which has the same function as a wedding ring			2
so important are necklaces to the @entity11 , a man will do all he can to make sure that his womenfolk are dressed in impressive beads			2
striking : older women still wear labrets that cut through their lower lips while all men wear the elaborate emedot hairstyle which is made using clay ( right ) elaborate : @entity11 women all wear beaded necklaces - women who do n't are shunned as ' being like animals ' by the men of the tribe painful : all @entity11 people have their lower incisors removed in childhood - a practice thought to have begun as a way to make nursing people with @entity226 easier clean teeth : the @entity11 use the esekon stick to clean their teeth ( left )			1
lower incisors , however , are removed in childhood using the corodat finger hook ( right ) @entity234 in @entity235 sits in the heart of @entity11 tribal lands between @entity11 and the @entity238			2

in particular , a woman without beads is bad and men will ignore her - they say " you look like an animal without beads "			2
' but jewellery is n't only for the women			0
men too wear elaborate decorations , most famously , their @entity275 or ear ornaments , which are made by the men of the tribe from aluminium			1
' men have elaborate mudpack hairdos called emedot which is a kind of chignon , ' adds @entity24			0
' it takes the shape of a large bun of hair at the back of the head and they decorate it with ostrich feathers to show they are elders or warriors			0
' tattoos are also common and usually have a special meaning , ' he continues			0
' men are tattooed on the shoulders and upper arm each time they kill an enemy — the right shoulder for killing a man , the left for a woman			0
' more gruesomely , the @entity11 tribe still cling to their tradition of knocking out the lower incisors - a practice usually done in childhood using a fearsome - looking finger hook called a corogat			1
' originally , it was supposed to protect people against tetanus because they can feed people with milk through the hole when they 're lock - jawed			0
it also means the lower teeth do n't interfere with the labrets many put on the lower lip			0
' sadly , the @entity11 , who have lived in their remote home for millennia , could be under threat after oil was discovered underneath their land			2
' many in @entity14 are worried that the @entity11 will lose their traditions , ' says @entity24			1
' i 'm not sure they will though			0
the @entity332 have succeeded in maintaining their way of life for centuries			0
against all the odds , they manage to raise livestock in the desert			0
their knowledge allows them to live where most humans could not			0
' threatened : because oil has been discovered on @entity347 , many are worried that their way of life and traditions could come under threat @entity351 : because of their many dogs , echinococcus is common among the @entity11			0
but they say the disease is caused by a spell cast by the @entity359 tribe remote : the @entity11 live in an inhospitable part of northern @entity14 , bordered by @entity16 to the north and @entity18 to the east @entity363 landscape : the @entity11 - and their neighbours , the @entity366 - live in an area dotted with volcanic rocks and where daytime temperatures climb to 45 degrees home : most @entity11 live in small dwellings made from wood , animal skins and palm leaves that they call an ' awl '			1
inside the homes live a man , his wives and children			0

the 250,000 strong @entity11 tribe live in remote northern @entity14 in an area bordered by @entity16 and @entity18
the area in which they live is arid and dotted with volcanic rocks , so they depend on livestock to survive
customs *include* using butter or animal fat to wash and using both - or dog poo - to stop their necklaces chafing
men graduate from a child to a warrior via a ceremony that involves killing an animal and being smeared with dung
their elaborate beaded necklaces *reflect* their social status and men will not look at women who do n't wear them
