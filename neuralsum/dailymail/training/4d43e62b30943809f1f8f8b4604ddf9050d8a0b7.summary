feline fantastic : @entity14 has been reunited with his pet @entity4 - found 1,100 miles away - after two years mr @entity3 recalled the moment his mother called him after the @entity12 vet checked @entity4 's microchip			1
he told @entity8 's @entity20 : ' i 'm like , " what do you mean you found @entity4 ? this has been two years now			1
" so i did n't really know what she was talking about , but she explained to me that he was in @entity12			1
i could n't believe it			0
how 's a cat get up there ? ' if @entity4 had driven to @entity11 in a car he would have passed through five states and taken more than 20 hours			1
mr @entity3 added : ' i came home from work one day and he just was n't there			1
looked for him obviously for a long time and just kind of gave up hope			0
' i always assumed that either he fell in the water , which he had done before , or maybe a tourist or something walking on the beach picked him up			0
' got the cream : @entity4 looks contented now he is back ... but where did he spend all that time ? staggering : the distance the cat had to travel back to @entity7 from @entity11 after mysteriously ending up there mystery : mr @entity3 , pictured , told @entity20 : ' i could n't believe it			1
