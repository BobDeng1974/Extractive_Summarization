by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 10:02 est , 28 may 2012 as excitement builds for the @entity4 , spoilsport council officials in one town have put a serious dampener on preparations by traders			0
patriotic shop owners in @entity9 want to hang @entity11 flag and @entity13 bunting across the road outside their businesses			1
but health and safety officials said they need to take out a £ 5m insurance policy to cover the cost of redirecting traffic while the flags are put up			1
frustration : high street traders along @entity24 in @entity9 have had to abandon plans to hang bunting across the road because council chiefs are insisting they take out £ 5million insurance cover shopkeepers had planned to hang the string of red , white and blue flags in an eye - catching zig - zag pattern down the length of the street , echoing scenes from other towns across the country			1
members of the @entity40 have now scrapped the display - and instead plan to simply hang the bunting in parallel lines above the pavement			2
the news is an upsetting blow for resident @entity48 , 78 , who painstakingly stitched the strings together and measured them exactly to fit the street			0
but @entity51 insisted on a raft of safety measures when erecting the display , including road closures , diversions and the hire of hydraulic cherry - pickers			2
officials ruled that any such an operation would require £ 5million worth of public liability insurance			2
@entity63 , chairman of the association , said she thought the ruling was unnecessary : ' it is rules for rules and they are a bunch of party poopers , ’ she said			0
patriotic : members of @entity75 with the @entity13 bunting they made			1
it will now be hung along the street instead of zig - zagging across it proud : residents had even marked the bunting so it would fit exactly between lampposts when it was strung across the road			1
' we were happy to hire a cherry picker to get up there and would have paid for that ourselves			0
' but nobody was willing to take on a £ 5 million public liability policy , which is quite understandable			0
' the association began planning decorations for the @entity13 torch and jubilee following a successful @entity93 on the @entity95 resident @entity94 , from @entity96 , offered to hand make bunting and the shops launched an appeal for fabric donations			1
the talented seamstress and her friends painstakingly cut and made the bunting in red , white and blue for the @entity105 and blue , yellow , black , green and red for the @entity13			1
they even marked the bunting so it would fit exactly between lampposts when it was strung across the road			2
killjoys : highways officials said they are not asking for insurance to cover the bunting , but to cover the risks associated with installing it ms @entity63 , manager of homemade food shop @entity118 , added : ' it would have looked so much better if we had been able to string it across the street			1
' i think it is amazing that a 78 - year - old woman came forward and volunteered to make the bunting , which was such a massive job			0
' she had specially made it so that it would fit perfectly between the lampposts , there were even tabs with instructions sewn into the bunting to say where it went			0
' i have seen other towns with bunting strung across the road and i ’m sure there was n’t all this fuss			0
' the 45 - member association was hit with a letter from @entity51 five weeks before the @entity13 torch passed through the street last week			1
result : traders said they would be looking into the possibility of taking out insurance for future events thousands of locals lined popular @entity24 to see the iconic torch as it made its way through @entity9			0
ms @entity63 added that the association had not looked into the cost of buying a £ 5 million public liability policy but would do so for future @entity159 from @entity51 said the £ 5 million insurance would have covered the disruption of erecting the bunting			2
he said : ' we are not asking for insurance to cover the bunting , but insurance is needed to put it up as a traffic management plan would have to be put in place to put it up and take it down and for a cherry picker to be used			1
' it is the installation process which needs covering and it is exactly the same for the district council when they put the @entity93 lights up for example			0
' @entity180 would already have liability insurance for this if they were to put it up			0

health and safety killjoys say insurance is needed to cover risk of putting up bunting
residents had spent weeks making @entity13 and jubilee bunting
