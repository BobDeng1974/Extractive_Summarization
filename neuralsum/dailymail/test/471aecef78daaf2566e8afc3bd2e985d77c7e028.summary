@entity0 , whose youthful brilliance usurped even @entity2 in the autumn of his career , considered a life beyond @entity6			1
this full - blooded driver , who has proved himself probably the best of his generation during 15 dazzling yet sometimes turbulent seasons , said @entity10 would be his last team and that when he walks out of the paddock for ever he will barely take a backward glance			1
‘ i will close the loop on that part of my life , ’ he said ahead of sunday ’s @entity13			2
@entity0 says he will retire from @entity6 once his deal with @entity18 comes to an end ‘ i started with @entity18 when i was three years old — a replica from my father ; i will finish with @entity18 , but the real one			1
that will be one third of my life			0
it will end with great experiences , great memories , great friendships , but normal life will start the day i retire			0
i do n’t think i ’ll become a driver manager or anything			0
after 15 or 16 or 17 years of @entity6 it ’s enough			2
’ such are @entity10 ’s difficulties that @entity0 may finish his career with two titles , a noble haul but fewer than his talents warrant — and fewer than anyone could have imagined when the @entity39 , then driving for @entity40 , denied @entity2 a record eighth crown in 2006			1
but @entity0 , 33 , is almost self - consciously happy about his lot despite leaving @entity43 to join @entity10 , who are struggling for pace and reliability			1
@entity0 left @entity10 in 2007 after a bitter year but says he is glad to be back for the 2015 season @entity10 have struggled for pace - and with mechanical faults - during the first two @entity13 of the season ‘ i was second in the championship with @entity43 three times and i did n’t want to be second for a fourth time , ’ he said			1
‘ if they win the championship , i might have another opinion on leaving			0
i ’ve been lucky to win championships and to win many grands prix , but now sometimes i feel happier and prouder doing the things we are doing now as a team than winning a trophy			0
‘ there are times when you arrive at a maturity and stage of mind that gives you different priorities in life			0
’ that was one of the great racers talking as he has never talked before			0
