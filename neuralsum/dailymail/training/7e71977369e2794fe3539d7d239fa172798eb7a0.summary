by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:30 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 13 march 2013 chancellor @entity2 is expected to unveil more help for homebuyers and extra investment in housebuilding families who want to upsize are to be offered government help to buying their second home with just a five per cent deposit			1
ministers are planning to expand a scheme aimed at first - time buyers to help so - called ‘ second - steppers ’ in a new attempt to revive the stagnant housing market			1
the move is part of a major package of reforms expected to be unveiled in next week ’s budget designed to restore @entity23 ’s tradition as a ‘ property owning democracy ’			2
a flagship element is expected to be extending the @entity27 scheme , which sees the government and banks underwrite mortgages , allowing them to purchase a property with only five per cent deposit			1
it means it could allow people to put as little equity as £ 11,000 into a £ 228,000 house			2
the scheme , which has so far helped 1,522 first - time buyers get their foot on the property ladder , will be offered to people looking to buy their second home , @entity37 reported			1
a survey by @entity44 found almost two thirds of second - steppers had been unable to move for more than a year while one in five think it is harder to move up the property ladder than get on it in the first place			1
the average age of a first - time buyer who does not get help from familiy is now 33 , but that rises to 41 for those buying their second home			1
ministers believe the lack of help for second - steppers is blocking the lower end of the property market and stalling sales of starter homes			1
the government is expected to offer more backing for housebuilding , after figures from the @entity71 showed a sharp drop in output from the construction industry the @entity27 scheme , currently only available to new - build properties , is also expected to be extended to older homes			1
buyers who purchase a property can use the scheme to obtain a mortgage of up to £ 500,000 from @entity82 , @entity83 or @entity84			2
developers and the government share some of the risk and guarantee to step in if the buyer fails to repay their mortgage			2
tens of thousands of new homes should be built to help revive the economy , business groups have warned			0
the @entity95 is calling for 50,000 affordable homes to be built , incentives for refurbishing empty homes and the housing guarantee scheme to be extended to all types of housing			1
it wants to shift £ 2.2billion from current spending to high - growth areas without adding to the deficit			0
this would include £ 1.25billion on capital investment – including housing – and £ 950m on high - growth business tax measures , such as a 2 per cent cap on the planned increase in business rates and the removal of stamp duty on equity finance for mid-sized companies			2
separately the @entity117 is warning today that a point may have to consider major cuts in business taxation and joins with the @entity95 in calling for 100,000 additional new homes to be built by 2015			0
chancellor @entity2 will unveil a series of measures in his march 20 budget aimed at helping tens of thousands more families buy a home and to address a chronic housing shortage by building more homes			2
@entity130 mp @entity129 yesterday called on mr @entity2 to use ‘ historically low rates ’ for government borrowing to ‘ prioritise capital investment , particularly in the housing market , to give a strong fillip to growth ’			1
the funding for lending scheme , which aims to encourage banks to lend more money to both individuals and businesses , is to be ‘ put on steroids ’ in an attempt to get credit flowing from banks			0
it has so far helped push down the cost of a two - year fixed rate £ 100,000 mortgage with a 10 per cent deposit , which is now £ 1,000 cheaper on average than when the scheme was launched			1
mortgage lending will rise this year by £ 10 billion for the first time since the financial crisis , according to industry predictions			0
fresh support is likely to be targeted particularly at the under - 30s after mr @entity160 said it was unacceptable that the average first - time buyer is now 33 years old			1
‘ we do n’t want to go back to the days of 110 per cent mortgages and encouraging people to take on borrowing that they ca n’t afford , ’ he said last week			0
‘ but it is important that people who work hard and do the right thing are able to buy a home , ’ he said			0
‘ it is a rebuke to those of us who believe in property owning democracy that the average age for someone buying their first home today , without any help from their parents is 33 years old			1
and we are determined to tackle that			0
’ more first - time buyers will be allowed to buy new - build property with a mortgage of just 75 per cent of its value and a five per cent deposit			1
the taxpayer and the builder together provide an ‘ equity loan ’ , effectively holding on to a stake in the home worth up to 20 per cent			0
when the property is sold , the builder and the state are repaid a percentage of the sale value to reflect their joint ownership			0
ministers believe cash - strapped second - steppers are holding up the housing market , and making it harder for first - time buyers to get on to the property ladder the prime minister used a major speech on the economy last week to signal that more help would be made available to help housebuyers			1
‘ we do n’t want to go back to the days of 110 per cent mortgages and encouraging people to take on borrowing that they ca n’t afford , ’ the mr @entity160 said			0
@entity160 last week warned that the average age of a first time - buyer is now 33 ‘ but it is important that people who work hard and do the right thing are able to buy a home , ’ he said			1
' it is a rebuke to those of us who believe in property owning democracy that the average age for someone buying their first home today , without any help from their parents is 33 years old			1
and we are determined to tackle that			0
’ boosting property ownership and encouraging construction of new developments is seek as a key way to use public investment to stimulate economic growth			0
the chancellor is expected to set out plans for new ' garden towns ' - areas of development on the edge of towns where planning rules are relaxed - and also make it easier for commercial premises to be transformed into new homes			2
a government source said : ‘ @entity248 will be key to this budget – we want to give as much support as we can to the whole sector			0
’ official figures show construction output in january fell 7.9 per cent on last year			0
@entity254 mp , @entity256 's shadow treasury minister , said : ‘ these are shocking figures , which expose how out of touch @entity160 was yesterday to claim his economic plan is n’t failing			0
‘ we need to kick - start our flatlining economy by investing in infrastructure projects and building thousands more affordable homes			0
' and to get small projects moving too @entity265 on home repairs , maintenance and improvements should be cut to 5 per cent			0
these measures would boost growth , create jobs and in the long - term strengthen our economy and help get the deficit down			2
