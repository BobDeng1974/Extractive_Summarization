the costly picture : @entity8 took this snap the moment before he fell on the last day of a school skiing trip in the @entity12 @entity8 's injuries : despite bouncing off rocks and ice during the fall he only needed treatment for ice burns on his arms after his jacket was pushed up to his elbows during the plunge @entity8 's @entity29 , containing the last picture he took , also survived the fall			1
he said : ' the battery goes quite quickly now , but there is not a crack on it			0
after i had stopped falling i just saw it there and tried to turn it on but it would n't			0
then , when i got to the hospital and it had dried out , it turned on			0
' @entity42 , 41 , said @entity8 was disappointed the phone still worked			1
@entity8 had hoped the accident would land him a phone upgrade but his old mobile survived she said : ' @entity8 has been after an @entity29 6 for ages and when it would n't turn on , he thought he was going to get a new one			1
but we are glad it came on because that was when he first spoke to me			0
' my husband had been told that he had been airlifted off , but we did n't know about any injuries			2
his phone coming back on was like it was meant to be			2
' @entity8 said : ' i was facing forwards taking pictures of the scenery , and i was about to put my phone away when i started to slip and lose my footing			1
i was shouting for help as i was falling – but then i could n't because i had snow in my mouth			0
' most of @entity8 's horrified friends feared the worst as he tumbled down the mountain			1
@entity42 added : ' @entity8 said when he got to the bottom of the mountain he knew he had n't broken anything as everything moved			1
' at the top of the mountain , @entity8 said a lot of people had taken their helmets off to take photos			1
his mum @entity42 said : ' luckily he had n't , because his helmet was all smashed			0
kids think helmets are not cool but @entity8 has now realised that they are			1
' ' it was cracked and bits had fallen off it , ' said @entity8 , ' as i was going down i was trying to stop myself by digging my boots in , but it flipped me over and hit my head – it was a scary experience and was the first time i 've ever thought i was going to die			2
' he added : ' you do need a helmet			0
it has saved my life			0

he said : ' as i fell , my jacket pushed up to my elbows and i got to one point when i started to slow down and i moved over on to one arm because the other one was hurting			2
that is when the left arm went bad			0
' @entity42 said @entity8 's left arm was ' quite a mess '			2
she added : ' he is lucky to be here			0
it could have been a totally different story			0
