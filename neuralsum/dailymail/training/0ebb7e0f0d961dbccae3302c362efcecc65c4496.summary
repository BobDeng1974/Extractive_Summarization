cancer is as old as the earliest life on earth and may never be completely wiped out , scientists have warned			1
despite billions being invested in countless research projects across the globe , a new study has reached the sobering conclusion : the disease is here to stay			1
the discovery means the disease will be more difficult to cure or treat , because of its highly evolved structure			2
scientists in @entity12 and @entity13 say the war on cancer , proclaimed in the 1970s , may never be won , as they discover the disease is more evolved that previously thought , cancer cells , pictured it suggests our cells ' ability to develop cancer is ' an intrinsic property ' , that has evolved over millions of years			1
but researchers , at @entity12 's @entity22 and the @entity23 of @entity13 , say ' knowing the enemy ' will give scientists the best possible chance to fight it			1
the evolutionary biologists have found the first evidence of naturally occurring tumours in two species of hydra - simple freshwater animals			1
they say the existence of the disease in the tiny , coral - like polyps that first emerged hundreds of millions of years ago , suggests cancer is an inherent part of our evolution			1
professor @entity40 , who lead the research team , said : ' cancer is as old as multi-cellular life on earth and will probably never be completely eradicated			1
' while searching for the origin of the cancer gene - the cause of all tumours - the team stumbled upon the discovery in hydras , said scientist @entity52			2
he said : ' our data predicted that the first multi-cellular animals already had most of the genes , which can cause cancer in humans			2
' the team of researchers found cancer tumours growing in two species of hydra , pictured , simple freshwater animals but they wanted to establish the evidence that these animals can actually suffer tumours			1
the team now believe they have achieved an impressive understanding of the roots of cancer			0
professor @entity40 said : ' now we have discovered tumour - bearing polyps in two different species of hydra , an organism very similar to corals			1
' this provides proof that tumours indeed exist in primitive and evolutionary old animals			2
' a further discovery was that the invasive nature of the disease also dates back millions of years			0
cancer is set to overtake heart disease and stroke as @entity92 's biggest killer , experts said this week			2
the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of @entity98 , scientists have found			2
and a ' tipping point ' is approaching when deaths from stroke and heart disease will be outnumbered by fatalities due to cancer - especially among men			2
the report 's co-author dr @entity105 , a senior researcher at the @entity107 , said : ' the reason why cancer has overtaken cardiovascular disease as the main cause of death in these countries is due to the fact that fewer people develop cardiovascular disease and , in those who do , fewer die from it			0
' this is probably due to improvements in the behavioural risk factors associated with @entity122 , such as decreases in the number of people smoking tobacco , along with better treatments , including preventive ones , such as the increasing use of statins			0
' if tumour cells are introduced into a healthy organism , they can trigger tumour growth in the hydras , the team found			0
professor @entity40 added : ' the invasive characteristic of cancer cells is also an evolutionary old feature			1
' in the @entity140 alone it is estimated more than $ 500 billion was invested in cancer research by 2012			0
the worldwide research has led to improved preventative , diagnostic and treatment methods , which have been proven to yield successes			0
but every second person affected by cancer still succumbs to the disease today			0
professor @entity40 concluded : ' our study makes it unlikely that the @entity151 proclaimed in the 1970s can ever be won			1
' cancer cells have deep evolutionary roots			0
any crucial cell in your body can make a mistake			0
you carry a time bomb in your body when you 're born			0
' it can explode early in life , or middle age or later			0
that does n't mean that , with a patient who develops cancer , there 's nothing you can do			0
' medical technology will allow us at early time points ... at least in some cases , to successfully treat and clean a patient completely and forever of troublemaking cells			1
' knowing your enemy from its origins is the best way to fight it , and win many battles , ' he added			1
the study was published in the journal @entity184 .			0
