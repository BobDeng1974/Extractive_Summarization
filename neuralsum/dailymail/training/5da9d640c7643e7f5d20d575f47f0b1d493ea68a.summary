when their daughter was born without fingers on her left hand , @entity0 and @entity1 feared her disability would cast a shadow over her life			1
and as soon as five - year - old @entity10 started school her self - consciousness was apparent – to the extent she would hide her left arm from her new friends			1
but now her embarrassment has turned to pride after she became the first child in @entity18 to receive an ultra-cheap prosthetic made on a 3d printer			1
unlike conventional prosthetic limbs , the charity e-nable make hands on 3d printers which intentionally stand out in a bid to make children proud of their differences unlike conventional versions , the £ 50 hands are deliberately bold and colourful to help make disabled children proud of being different			0
‘ it was all her dreams come true , ’ said mr @entity1 , 36			0
‘ it ’s the little things – she can hold her teddy , peel a banana and even paint her nails now			0
it has made a real difference to her – the philosophy behind the charity is amazing			2
‘ children pick their own designs and colours , and they do n’t look like you would expect a prosthetic to look			0
they make the kids feel really special , rather than being something to be embarrassed about			0
’ @entity10 was born with symbrachydactyly – a congenital abnormality which left her with just a stump instead of fingers			1
doctors only offered the family an operation to transplant a toe to her hand			0
‘ we did n’t make a big deal out of it , but if she would stand for a photograph , she would stand with her other hand over it , or behind her back , ’ said her father , an @entity61 - based electrical contractor			2
‘ we always said it ’s just part of her but there was a stage when she was going to nursery and kids ask questions			0
’ the family found out about the not - for - profit group @entity78 , which introduced them to @entity81 engineer @entity80			1
after being put in touch with an expert through the charity , @entity10 's parents @entity0 and @entity1 made a plaster cast at home and sent it to the professor			1
he then printed the parts on a 3d printer and posted the arm back the @entity92 made a plaster cast of @entity10 ’s arm and sent it to professor flood			1
he printed the parts on a 3d printer and six weeks later a pink and purple bionic arm arrived in the post			2
the simple device is controlled by the wrist and wiring			0
@entity78 has made around 40 superhero - style hands since it was formed a year ago			1
some have flashing lights , others claws			0
@entity109 , a volunteer at the charity , said : ‘ when we started it was more about function , but now it is as much about self - esteem			2
‘ the hands are cool , so the kids go from being the one who maybe has an issue at school , to suddenly having a cool superhero arm that everybody wants			0
’ the charity was formed by @entity124 prop designer @entity123 and @entity127 carpenter @entity125 , who lost his fingers in a mechanical saw .			1

five - year - old @entity131 was born without any fingers on her left hand
her parents were told the only option on the @entity138 was major surgery
*desperate* for an *alternative* , they turned to the internet and found a charity
there , experts made @entity10 a *pretty* @entity149 printed pink and purple robo - limb
charity , @entity78 , has helped 40 kids in @entity124 and wants to help more in @entity18
