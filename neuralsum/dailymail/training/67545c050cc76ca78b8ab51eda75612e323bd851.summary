defiant congressional republicans attacked president @entity2 's agenda from all sides tuesday , ignoring the five veto threats he has issued in a week 's time and pushing bills to uproot his policy agenda			1
immigration , @entity9 , the @entity12 - to - @entity11 oil pipeline and a sweeping reboot of how the @entity14 enacts costly regulations are all on the chopping block , and the president 's insistence on his way has some in the @entity20 steamed			1
' i 'm a member of @entity22 ; i 'm not a potted plant			0
i do n't take my orders from the @entity14 , ' @entity25 @entity24 rep. @entity24 told the @entity27 after @entity20 members met behind closed doors to discuss their strategy			1
' there 's a new sheriff in the @entity33 , and so he 's not going to have a compliant majority leader in the @entity33 who 's going to bottle up and bury everything , ' @entity24 said			0
' i 'm not a @entity36 ! ' : @entity25 @entity24 rep. @entity24 said tuesday after his leadership warned president @entity2 would negate their work if it 's not to his liking @entity2 ( center ) , joined by top congressional leaders from both major parties on tuesday at the @entity14 , spoke to media before laying out his ultimatums and warning that he holds a veto pen that was a nod to new senate majority leader @entity49			1
republicans had complained in the first six years of the @entity2 presidency that former leader @entity51 , a @entity53 @entity52 , frequently refused to bring any bill to a vote if the @entity14 opposed it			2
@entity2 invited his antagonists to the @entity14 for their first face - to - face meeting since the new @entity20 - controlled @entity22 convened			1
but their show of cordiality for the cameras did little to mask the partisan hostilities between @entity62 and the @entity14			0
' the key now is for us to work as a team , ' said @entity2 , despite his prolific veto warnings			1
he cited taxes , trade and cybersecurity as areas for potential cooperation			0
back at the @entity62 , the @entity33 debated legislation to force @entity2 's administration to green - light the @entity75 project , and the @entity14 moved toward a vote late tuesday on a regulatory reform bill that the @entity14 says would impose ' unprecedented and unnecessary ' requirements on agencies trying to write rules			2
it would require more justifications and notice , particularly for regulations that would cost the treasury millions of dollars			0
that may be followed wednesday by votes on two other bills			0
one would alter a key section of the 2010 @entity91 financial overhaul in a way that would help banks ; the other would block @entity2 's executive actions on immigration , including removal of protections for immigrants who arrived in the country illegally as children			2
the @entity75 bill passed the @entity14 last week and is expected to clear the @entity33 next week and head to @entity2 's desk			2
vetoes almost surely await , although the @entity14 's official policy statements are couched in language that guarantees only that the president 's aides will recommend he reject the legislation			1
far from cowed , with the @entity33 in @entity20 hands for the first time in eight years @entity20 lawmakers are ready to make him uncap that veto pen			1
cooperation : @entity14 press secretary @entity118 's role this week is to promote the talking point that the president has his arms open and is willing to work with @entity20 work as a team ? @entity2 charmed legislators on tuesday but did little to assuage @entity20 ' suspicion that he 's playing political games while the president mouthed words of cooperation , @entity14 press secretary @entity118 openly criticized @entity20 lawmakers during a daily press briefing , painting @entity2 as the only non-obstructionist with any meaningful power in @entity131			1
the @entity20 's approach to the opening days of the new @entity22 , @entity118 told reporters , raises questions ' about how serious they are about trying to work with the president			2
' ' in the first five days that they 've been in session , they 've advanced five pieces of legislation all the way to the @entity142 that they already know this president strongly opposes , ' he said			0
@entity20 have no plans to stop there			0
citing the terrorist attacks in @entity148 , @entity20 senators proposed on tuesday to restrict how @entity2 can transfer terror suspects out of the federal prison at @entity151 , @entity152 , for the remainder of his term			0
that move would make it far more difficult for him to fulfill his 2007 campaign promise to close the facility .			0

@entity20 members resent being pushed around by the @entity14 after their *stunning* *electoral* sweep two *months* ago
@entity2 warns that he *'ll* reject five specific bills that *disagree* with his policy agenda but insists that @entity20 ' work as a team ' with him
@entity14 @entity20 is moving ahead anyway with an attempt to neuter the president 's immigration *amnesty* push
they seem intent on forcing @entity2 to uncap his veto pen and take a stand on issues where they *perceive* the public is on their side
