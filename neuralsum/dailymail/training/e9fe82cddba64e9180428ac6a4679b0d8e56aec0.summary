@entity9 authorities said they had rescued a total of 1,026 survivors during several missions by the country 's navy in the @entity15 in the last 24 hours five of the desperate refugees died as they attempted the deadly crossing from @entity6 to @entity7 earlier this month the @entity51 refugee agency , @entity50 , estimated that 3,419 migrants had died while attempting to cross the @entity1 to reach @entity7 since january 1 , making it the deadliest sea route for migrants			1
most of the 207,000 who attempted to seek asylum or emigrate through making the perilous crossing were from @entity60 or @entity61			1

earlier this month the @entity51 refugee agency , @entity50 , estimated that 3,419 migrants had died while attempting to cross the @entity1 to reach @entity7 since january 1 one of the dead was brought onto the navy 's @entity29 vessel by a merchant ship from @entity32 , while the other four were taken onto the @entity34 patrol boat from a @entity36 vessel the scheme was responsible for bringing some 150,000 migrants to shore in its year of operation , but critics said it encouraged migrants to risk everything to get to @entity7 and made the job of people smugglers easier			1
there were reports of traffickers steering ships into the middle of the ocean before abandoning them , leaving the passengers with just mobile or satellite phones and the contact number of the @entity9 coastguard , but it is not known how widespread this practice was			0
@entity9 says @entity67 , which was launched after two sinkings off the island of @entity101 in october last year , leaving more than 400 dead , was costing nine million euros a month			2
it has been replaced by an @entity69 - run operation known as @entity104 whose mandate is limited to patrolling waters within 30 nautical miles of the coastline			0
but organisations including @entity110 and @entity50 have warned this will lead to more deaths			0
they dispute the argument that rescue operations increase the ' pull factor ' drawing migrants to @entity7 , and argue that the growing numbers and rising proportions of children , women and disabled people , reflect a surge in refugee numbers due to conflicts like @entity60 / @entity126 .			0
