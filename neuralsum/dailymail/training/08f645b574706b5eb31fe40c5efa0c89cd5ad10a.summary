@entity0 , 56 , knew that @entity1 in @entity2 had a reputation for being a hotbed of holiday romances between young local men and oilder @entity8 women			1
but when she decided to take a break there with her friend @entity11 in 2005 , she never thought she 'd find herself caught up in one			1
' i 'm quite worldly-wise , ' said @entity0 , from @entity13 , who considered herself too sensible to get embroiled with a younger man			1
@entity17 quickly made it clear he wanted more than just a one - night stand while she was on holiday in the country			1
' i was completely sucked in , ' said @entity0			1
when @entity17 proposed , @entity0 decided to keep it a secret from her younger sister @entity32 , knowing she would disapprove			1
instead , she flew to @entity1 and married him , leaving @entity32 to call her a fool			1
quickly , @entity0 began to see that she might have been right			1
@entity17 said he wanted to move into @entity0 's house with her in the @entity8 , even though she had set her heart on a new life in @entity1 , as they had discussed			1
nonetheless , she loved him , so she agreed			2
but as soon as the couple arrived in the @entity8 , @entity0 began to question @entity17 's loyalty , especially when he began disappearing for long periods			1
after calling a number that appeared frequently on his phone bill , she reached a woman with whom @entity17 had been having a relationship for six years			1
' when i confronted @entity17 he just admitted it and laughed			1
" people laugh when they see us together , " he said			2
my self - confidence sunk to an all - time low			2
he had drained me of everything , both financially and emotionally			2
' ' i blamed myself for being foolish and falling for it			2
i 'm supposed to be intelligent but i never had an inkling			2
' i believed everything he said			2
and if he had told me the woman was just a friend , i 'd still have believed him			2
' @entity32 admits worrying that her sister might take her own life , because @entity17 had robbed her of everything			1
but @entity0 is not alone when it comes to confident tricksters scamming women in matters of the heart on holiday			1
around 1,000 @entity8 people are victims of dating scams each year , according to the @entity69			1
love at first sight ? when @entity72 , from @entity73 , met @entity74 while on holiday in @entity76 , she was utterly charmed , but when he came to live with her in @entity77 she saw his true colours in 2004 , a smooth - talking gentleman named @entity80 began speaking to widow @entity81 , 56 , from @entity73 , while in @entity76 , @entity82			1
handsome and polite , he told her he worked as an undercover agent in the @entity85			0
' i fell for him			1
he came to see me in @entity87 and never left			1
it felt like we 'd been together for years , ' said @entity72			0
but before she knew it , @entity80 was talking her into buying him £ 17,000 cars and loaning him money , always promising to pay her back but never doing it			0
one night , when he became aggressive , she called the police			0
they came and arrested him and revealed he was a wanted man , on the run from @entity98 for committing fraud and theft all over the world			2
' i felt emotionally betrayed , ' said @entity72			0
' it was a lot to deal with and i get quite emotional when i think about it			0
i do n't think i 'll ever get over it			0
' @entity72 is now rebuilding her life with her new partner @entity107 , a local chef , and @entity74 is in jail , but she has been left with the scars of her ordeal with the man who called himself ' @entity113 '			0
young love ? @entity115 , 19 , from @entity116 in @entity117 , was just 16 when she began an internet relationship with a man named @entity120 who lived in @entity121 , @entity122 @entity115 , 19 , from @entity116 in @entity117 , was just 16 when she began an internet relationship with a man named @entity120 who lived in @entity121 , @entity122 , a resort in which she often holidayed with her family			0
the pair began chatting in a forum dedicated to the destination , and finally met in 2010 , when she returned with her mother and a family friend			0
as soon as she saw him @entity115 knew he was the one			0
' i felt my heart melt			0
he was perfect , ' she said			0
they grew close immediately , and when she flew back to @entity117 she told her mother she had decided to emigrate to @entity122 to live their with her new boyfriend			1
despite warnings from family and friends , @entity115 returned to @entity121 in 2011 , but her relationship with @entity120 soon soured , with money running out and @entity120 spending more time out of the house , leading @entity115 to believe he was having an affair			0
when he became physically violent towards her @entity115 fled home , where she discovered @entity120 was a serial philanderer , moving from @entity8 woman to @entity8 woman , and frequently getting them - @entity115 included - pregnant			0
abusive correspondence followed , including one message in which @entity120 said he wished that she and their unborn baby die in childbirth , and now @entity115 is now seeking legal advice to ensure her young son is safe from his father , who has threatened to bring him back to @entity122			0
love in a warm climate : @entity162 met @entity163 in 1999 in @entity122 , but after three years with him she discovered he had fathered a child with another woman during their relationship @entity168 , 60 , a sales manager from @entity169 , says her ' holiday love rat ' , also from @entity121 , cheated her out of some £ 42,000			2
@entity171 , who called himself @entity163 , was a jeweller who began pursuing @entity162 in 1999 , when she was holidaying in @entity122 alone			0
he took her out for meals , paid her lots of attention , and gave her jewellery he told her he had made himself			0
over three years she gave him plenty of money and bought him a motorbike , always giving one excuse or another about why he could n't pay her back just yet			0
she became disillusioned with him and broke up the relationship , only to discover he had fathered a child with his common law @entity122 wife while they had been together , and that he had , in total , nine children with three different women			2
' i used to be so trusting , ' she said			0
' now i 'm much more sceptical about everything			0
