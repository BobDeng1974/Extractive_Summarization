a report into the death of @entity2 , 17 , who killed himself after being arrested for drink driving , has confirmed ' failings ' at the station where he was held a report into the death of an @entity10 student who killed himself days after being arrested for drink driving found ' evidence of a concerning culture ' at the police station where he was held			1
@entity2 , 17 , shot himself dead at his parent 's £ 850,000 home in @entity19 , @entity20 , two days after being held at @entity22 police station for drink driving			1
during an inquest into his death , lawyers for his parents claimed that police had mocked him for his middle class upbringing and his new car , contributing to his death			1
now an @entity34 report into mr @entity2 's death , made public for the first time , confirms there were ' failings ' at @entity22 police station where the teen was held			1
the @entity34 probe , which was kept hidden from the teen 's inquest but has been revealed by the @entity45 , uncovered ' evidence of a concerning culture ' at @entity22			2
following the report one @entity50 sergeant was moved from custody duty due to ‘ inappropriate behaviour ’ , while another was given ‘ management advice ’ , the report says			1
two custody detention officers were also subjected to sanctions as a result of the investigation , according to a copy of the @entity34 report obtained by the @entity45			0
mr @entity2 was stopped by police in @entity62 in august 2012 while driving his new @entity64 home from a party , just weeks after passing his test			1
a breathalyzer showed he was over the drink drive limit and he was arrested			0
lawyers for mr @entity2 's parents @entity70 and @entity72 ( pictured ) told an inquest their son was bullied for his middle class upbringing			1
the report , revealed today , found ' evidence of a concerning culture ' among police the teen , who had recently gained one a and four bs in his as - levels and was working on his university application and travel plans , was then held for seven hours overnight			1
but due to an ' anomaly ' in custody laws meaning 17 - year - olds are treated as adults , mr @entity2 's parents @entity70 and @entity72 were not informed of the arrest after he opted not to tell them			2
two days later he was found dead at home by his father			0
next to the body was the police charge sheet , and a note saying he thought he had ' ruined his life '			0
his parents have since led a successful campaign to have the age limit raised to 18 , after an inquest was told mr @entity2 's suicide could ‘ very likely ’ have been avoided if they were informed			2
the @entity34 report , together with a response from @entity50 , were prepared in time for the inquest but were not submitted as evidence , meaning this is the first time they have been made public			1
@entity70 and @entity109 said the inquest was turned into a ‘ gruelling and frustrating ’ process by the police 's failure to reveal the reports			2
in a statement , they hit out at the ‘ behaviour and attitude of the custody officers ’ , adding : ' we love @entity2 and will continue to miss him every day for the rest of our lives			2
' mr @entity2 's parents were not informed that their son had been arrested in august 2012 due to an ' anomaly ' in custody laws			1
@entity70 and @entity72 ( pictured ) have since successfully campaign to have the law changed the @entity34 said the force has said it has ‘ learned lessons and had been improving working practice ’			0
assistant chief constable @entity129 , who gave evidence at the inquest , said : ' our thoughts continue to be with the family of @entity135 , and we sympathise with the issues they have raised following this tragedy			0
' when @entity135 died in 2012 there was a confusing anomaly where the @entity141 led the police to treat 17 - year - olds as adults , whilst the @entity145 stated that 17 - year - olds should be treated as children			0
' following the case and a judicial review in 2013 the government have changed the legislation relating to 17 - year - olds in custody			0
' the new legislation states that when a 17 - year - old is arrested they are now treated as children for the purposes of informing people about the child ’s detention			0
' while in custody @entity135 made the decision that he did not want anyone to be informed of his arrest			0
however , if this happened today we would have informed his parents			0
