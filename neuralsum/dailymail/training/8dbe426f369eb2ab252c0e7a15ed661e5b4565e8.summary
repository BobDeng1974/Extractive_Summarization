one in ten @entity1 earns more than the prime minister , official figures show			1
despite efforts to rein in the pay of family doctors , many still receive vastly more than @entity8 ’s annual salary of £ 142,500			1
a total of 3,430 general practitioners earned more than £ 150,000 in 2012/13 – 10.5 per cent of self - employed gps – according to the figures , published yesterday by the government ’s @entity13			1
a total of 3,430 general practitioners earned more than £ 150,000 in 2012/13 ( picture posed by model ) some 630 were paid more than £ 200,000 and 160 received in excess of £ 250,000			1
last night campaigners criticised the ‘ telephone - number salaries ’ , saying they would anger patients who have difficulty getting an appointment with their gp			1
the official figures also reveal a huge disparity in pay levels between male and female gps			1
men on average were paid £ 109,400 – spending another £ 169,000 on office expenses and staff salaries			1
women doctors , in contrast , received £ 73,800 and spent another £ 101,100 on expenses and salaries			1
the figures actually reveal a slight decline in pay since 2011/12			2
contractor gps – those 80 per cent of family doctors who are partners in their surgery – received an average £ 102,000 last year , a £ 1,000 , or 0.9 per cent , decrease on the year before			1
but their pay is still vastly higher than a decade ago thanks to a controversial contract that also allowed them to stop working out of hours			0
before the contract – brought in by @entity47 in 2004 – gps earned an average of £ 77,000 a year			2
that leaped to £ 110,000 after the contract was introduced , but has been gradually falling ever since as ministers try to get a grip on their pay			2
the other 20 per cent of gps are salaried			0
they are paid by their practices and earn much less			2
the @entity58 has imposed a freeze on public sector pay , but it can not make contractor gps – who are self - employed – pay themselves any less			2
gender pay gap : male doctors were paid an average of £ 109,000 , but women were received £ 73,800 ( file pic ) instead the government has put strict limits on the increase in the overall contract sum payable to surgeries – the money out of which gps have to take their salaries			1
the official pay report , which is based on @entity77 data , shows that the average gross figure available to @entity1 for running their practices rose by 1.4 per cent in 2012/2013			2
but because the cost of rent , practice staff salaries and office expenses rose , doctors had slightly less left to pay themselves			2
doctors have complained bitterly about being forced to pay themselves less – and even suggested that the gp surgery is facing ‘ threat of extinction ’			0
the @entity89 said earlier this year that some surgeries could be forced to close because of smaller budgets			0
and the @entity92 has complained that below - inflation pay rises had left doctors with a ‘ deep sense of outrage ’			0
more than half of gps think that their pay is so bad that they are considering early retirement , according to a poll of doctors published in march			1
yet when their pay was boosted by 30 per cent a decade ago even some doctors admitted they were surprised by what they had managed to negotiate			0
in 2007 , dr @entity106 , the @entity92 negotiator who won the deal , said : ‘ it was just stunning really			0
stunning in that no one in my position had ever believed we could pull it off			0
’ he had at first thought @entity1 ’ pay would be docked by up to £ 50,000 if they wanted to opt out of working out of hours			0
but the @entity47 government let them reduce their pay by only £ 6,000 each if they opted not to work the anti-social shifts – and gave them a huge pay increase for their other work			0
@entity118 , policy analyst at the @entity119 ’ @entity121 campaign group , said : ‘ patients waiting weeks for appointments because their gp does n’t open at weekends or out of hours will find these telephone - number salaries particularly galling			0
‘ gps are highly qualified professionals and should be compensated as such , but their pay packages have exploded since the disastrous 2004 gp contract , which sees them get paid more to work less			1
‘ if @entity130 gps ’ pay fell in line with that of their counterparts in the likes of @entity136 and @entity137 , we could afford more of them and slash the time it takes to get an appointment			0
’ a @entity143 spokesman said : ‘ general practice is the bedrock of the @entity146 which is why we ’ve increased funding , strengthened proper family doctoring and provided millions more patients with evening and weekend appointments			0

official figures show thousands of gps earn more than @entity8
some 630 family doctors were paid more than £ 200,000 in 2012/13
meanwhile 160 took home more than a *quarter* of a million pounds
campaigners said the large pay packets would anger patients
