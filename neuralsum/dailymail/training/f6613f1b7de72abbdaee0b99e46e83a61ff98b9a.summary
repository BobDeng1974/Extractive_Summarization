by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 asks users to post short 20 - second videos in the place of photos a bit of filter - action and the right angle can make anyone look good on @entity11			1
but there has been a backlash against the dating - app , and others like it , which relies almost exclusively on appearance to create matches			2
now a competitor is gearing up to launch an @entity21 app that could mean the end of these mismatches			1
the @entity25 - based service is called @entity2 and will ask users to post videos in the place of heavily - filtered photos			1
it is currently available online , and an app version is due to go live next month			2
users have to upload clips that are around 20 seconds long , showing a part of their personality or their hobbies			1
in a similar way to @entity11 's rating system , users earn ' ticks ' if they are liked and ' icks ' if not			1
if two members both tick each other , @entity2 announces a match and they can start talking through text or video messaging			2
' if you just ca n't decide whether to tick ' em or ick ' em , just put a pin in it and click @entity50			0
' we 'll save the video for you to watch later , ' the company wrote on its website			0
in a similar way @entity11 's rating system , users earn ' ticks ' if they are liked and ' icks ' if not			2
then , if two members both tick each other , @entity2 announces a match and they can start talking to one another through text or video messaging users can also go through profile pictures to find those they like , but the general aim is to provide a more ' genuine ' dating experience by watching videos			1

the first 5,000 people to sign up will get free lifetime membership			0

@entity77 found her irresistible , and now scientists say that ladies wearing red really are more attractive to men			0
a new study claims that wearing the colour increases a woman 's sex appeal and also makes her seem more approachable and competent			0
it found that women also find red attractive on men - but the effect is n't as powerful			0
psychologists at @entity91 , in @entity92 , @entity93 , showed 280 heterosexual students 32 pictures of the opposite sex and asked them to rate them according to how attractive they found them			0
the people in the photos were wearing either blue , white or red			0
male students found ' feminine ' women wearing red the most attractive and also rated them highest for looking ' warm ' and competent .			0
