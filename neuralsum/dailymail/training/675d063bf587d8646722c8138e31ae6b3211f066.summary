by @entity0 the traditional two - week annual holiday could become a thing of the past within ten years as families increasingly opt for several ' mini-breaks ' instead , according to new research			1
a study of @entity9 ' changing holiday habits also predicted that by 2023 the majority of the @entity9 people will travel with multiple generations of their family including parents , grandparents and children			1
and rather than head abroad to the sunshine , twice as many will have ' staycations ' in the @entity9 , taking an average of two or three trips each year for four days			1
the traditional family vacation of two weeks abroad , is often now unpractical for busy modern families accommodation preferences are also set to transform , with many brits choosing to stay in unusual locations such as lighthouses and windmills			1
the report , which examined the holiday habits of over 10,000 people , also showed that staycations have jumped by more than 61 per cent this summer , compared to 2012			2
a separate study from @entity36 has shown that overseas holidays have continued to fall since 2010 , dropping an estimated five per cent in the last year			0
recent figures from the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) also show that travel to long - haul destinations fell by five per cent in 2012			1
the cost of overseas trips , and environmental issues concerned with flying , are the leading cause of the fall in brits travelling abroad			0
the report also revealed that savvy brits are searching for better value breaks , and there is a growing demand for interesting destinations closer to home			0
@entity56 , chief executive of luxury cottage rental firm @entity57 which produced the report , said : ' more and more of us are enjoying holidays with our extended family			0
the good weather this summer has seen people taking advantage of @entity66 's natural beauty spots such as the @entity67 at @entity68 , near @entity69 in @entity70 ' our hectic lifestyles also mean the typical two - week trip is no longer practical for most families , and as a result it is being phased out in favour of the four day mini-break			1
' many families , because of university or work commitments , also find that increasingly they live apart			0
' mini-breaks provide an opportunity for relatives to get together at short notice , and it seems that this trend will become even more of a popular option for holiday - goers over the next decade			2
' @entity56 added : ' with the economy still fluctuating and money tight , @entity9 travellers are increasingly swapping long - haul flights and trips aboard to favourite destinations in the @entity9			1
@entity57 has seen a r40 per cent increase n bookings in their converted lighthouse properties ' the trend for staycations has been increasing year on year , and the great weather this summer has been a watershed			0
' the weather has caused brits to flock back to @entity9 's beaches , attractions and heritage ; some of the finest in all of @entity105			0
' this year in particular has shown that the @entity9 can be a fantastic holiday choice , and may provide a boost to the @entity9 tourism industry which will see many more brits choosing to explore @entity9 shores over the next decade rather than holiday abroad			1
' @entity56 explains : ' there has been a large increase in people holidaying in unconventional accommodation , from railway carriages , to windmills and even lighthouses			2
' we 've witnessed a 40 per cent increase in people staying in our lighthouse properties in the last year , with @entity123 in particular proving popular			0
' the next ten years for the @entity9 travel and tourism industry is looking increasingly healthy , with the holiday habits of brits suggesting that in a decade 's time many more of us will be content to holiday at home			2
