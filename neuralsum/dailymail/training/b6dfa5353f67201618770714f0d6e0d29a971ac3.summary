by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor the @entity4 plot to take over @entity6 schools is driven by the same ' warped ' @entity8 extremism as @entity10 terror group @entity9 , @entity2 claimed this morning			1
mr @entity2 said the alleged plot by @entity8 hardliners in @entity6 was part of a wider global problem of ' extremism based on a warped and abusive view of a religion '			1
six @entity6 schools were placed in special measures after the education watchdog @entity21 unearthed damning evidence that school children were being left at risk of being radicalised			1
@entity2 this morning likened the alleged @entity4 @entity8 plot to take over @entity6 schools to the @entity10 terror network @entity9 mr @entity2 said the scandal showed @entity28 had a problem with extremism - like @entity10 had with @entity9 , the terror network which sparked global outrage after kidnapping hundreds of school girls			1
he said the issue was part of a wider narrative of religious extremism that had to be met head on the former @entity37 said : ' i have a very clear view of this			1
there is a fundamental problem that we face that may have originated in this region but has now spread across the world			0
' and that problem is extremism based on a warped and abusive view of a religion			0
' it is a problem here in the region , it 's a problem in countries like @entity56 , it 's a problem in the @entity57			0
' we can see from @entity10 and @entity58 it 's a problem in @entity61 countries and it 's a problem in our own society as we can see from the issue of the @entity6 schools			1
' what we need to do is not a question of simply reasserting @entity28 values			1
we have to assert the strong values of religious respect and tolerance for difference			0
' in other words , to say that the only way the only way a modern economy and a modern society can work is if people of different faiths learn to live with each other , respect each other and treat each other equally and fairly			1
' and any politics that is based on a view that " this is my religion , or this is my view of my religion and if you do n't agree then you 're my enemy " , that is the ideology that we have to attack and root out			0
' @entity89 reacted to the revelations that @entity8 hardliners had tried to take over a number of @entity6 schools by announcing a drive to ' teach @entity28 values ' to all children @entity96 , vice chairman of @entity97 - one of the academies put in special measures - attacked the @entity21 findings the controversial intervention came after @entity89 called for @entity28 @entity102 to be more @entity28 in the wake of the @entity4 scandal			1
mr @entity89 said extremism and division was flourishing because of a ' worrying ' failure to push @entity28 values			1
he said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the @entity109			2
the prime minister 's intervention came after teachers were told by the education secretary @entity113 that they must in future ' actively promote @entity28 values '			1
home secretary @entity115 and the education secretary @entity113 fell out over the government 's response to @entity8 extremists mr @entity89 said these values would include ' a belief in freedom , tolerance of others , accepting personal and social responsibility , respecting and upholding the rule of law '			1
writing in the @entity126 he said these values were ' as @entity28 as the @entity128 , as football , as fish and chips			2
he added that it was ' not an option ' for anyone living in this country not to live by them			0
he also suggested that any move away from the ' western model ' of democracy and free enterprise would threaten @entity28 's economic success			2
mr @entity89 said : ' in recent years we have been in danger of sending out a worrying message : that if you do n't want to believe in democracy , that 's fine ; that if equality is n't your bag , do n't worry about it ; that if you 're completely intolerant of others , we will still tolerate you			2
' this has not just led to division , it has also allowed extremism - of both the violent and non-violent kind - to flourish , " he said in the article			0
' we need to be far more muscular in promoting @entity28 values and the institutions that uphold them			1
' a genuinely liberal country believes in certain values , actively promotes them and says to its citizens : this is what defines us as a society			0
' mr @entity89 said it was ' a matter of pride and patriotism ' to promote @entity28 values and history and urged people to stop being ' squeamish ' about doing so			1
' as president @entity172 put it when he addressed mps and peers in @entity176 , " what began on this island would inspire millions throughout the continent of @entity180 and across the world "			0
' celebrations are planned next year to mark 800 years since @entity183 signed the @entity109 at @entity184 which established for the first time that the king was subject to the law			0
mr @entity89 said they will now include lessons for all pupils			2
mr @entity113 believed mrs may was not doing enough to take on fanatics ' the remaining copies of that charter may have faded , but its principles shine as brightly as ever , and they paved the way for the democracy , the equality , the respect and the laws that make @entity28 , @entity28			0
' so i want to use this upcoming 800th anniversary as an opportunity for every child to learn about the @entity109 , for towns to commemorate it , for events to celebrate it			2
' mr @entity113 pledged ' decisive action ' after schools inspector @entity21 issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of @entity6 's schools			1
inspections conducted following claims of a takeover plot by hardline @entity102 found that a ' culture of fear and intimidation ' has developed in some schools			2
a poll by @entity223 for the @entity224 showed that 58 per cent of voters believe faith schools should not receive taxpayer funding , or be closed altogether			0
it found three quarters are concerned there is a serious risk pupils could be encouraged to adopt extremist views in predominantly @entity8 schools			2
most , 56 per cent , also thought all faith schools should not be allowed to teach only their own religion			0
none of those which faced inspections over the ' @entity4 ' allegations were faith schools but shadow education secretary @entity241 said he would like cross-party talks on the issue			0
' events in @entity6 have raised questions about faith , multiculturalism and state education and in the aftermath this is the moment to think about discussing , on a cross-party basis , how we manage potential tensions , particularly in urban districts , ' he told the newspaper			0
he called for strong powers for @entity21 to inspect teaching of religion and backed the idea that schools should teach about other faiths .			0

former @entity37 says plot to take over @entity6 schools part of global problem
claims @entity8 extremism in @entity271 also a ' problem in our own society '
but dismisses @entity89 's *proposal* to teach @entity28 values to all pupils
prime minister wants all children to learn about the @entity109
@entity2 says extremism ' not a question of simply reasserting @entity28 values '
claims only solution is ' different faiths learning to live with each other '
