' we were sending out search parties for people ' : former labour cabinet minister @entity3 has admitted that his party actively encouraged immigration to the @entity6 while in government @entity8 sent out ‘ search parties ’ for immigrants to get them to come to the @entity6 , @entity3 has admitted			1
in a stunning confirmation that the @entity13 and @entity14 governments deliberately engineered mass immigration , the former cabinet minister and spin doctor said @entity8 sought out foreign workers			1
he also conceded that the influx of arrivals meant the party ’s traditional supporters are now unable to find work			0
by contrast , @entity8 leader @entity25 has said his party got it wrong on immigration but has refused to admit it was too high under @entity8			2
between 1997 and 2010 , net migration to @entity6 totalled more than 2.2million , more than twice the population of @entity30			1
the annual net figure quadrupled under @entity8 from 48,000 people in 1997 to 198,000 by 2009			2
lord @entity3 ’s remarks come three years after @entity8 officials denied claims by former adviser @entity36 that they deliberately encouraged immigration in order to change the make - up of @entity6			1
mr @entity36 said the policy was designed to ‘ rub the @entity42 ’s nose in diversity ’			0
he said there was ‘ a driving political purpose : that mass immigration was the way that the government was going to make the @entity6 truly multicultural ’			1
senior @entity8 figures have been reluctant to concede they deliberately engineered the influx of migrants who have transformed communities over the past decade			1
but , at a rally for the @entity54 , @entity3 said : ‘ in 2004 when as a @entity8 government , we were not only welcoming people to come into this country to work , we were sending out search parties for people and encouraging them , in some cases , to take up work in this country			2
’ he said : ‘ the problem has grown during the period of economic stagnation over the last five , six years			0
’ when @entity8 encouraged new arrivals ‘ we were almost ... a full employment economy ’ but , he admitted : ‘ the situation is different obviously now			0
‘ we have to just realise ... entry to the labour market of many people of @entity74 origin is hard for people who are finding it very difficult to find jobs , who find it hard to keep jobs			0
‘ for these people immigration tends to loom large in their lives and in their worlds , now that is an inescapable fact , and we have to understand it , address it , engage with people in discussion about it			0
’ mr @entity3 's admission that @entity8 sought out foreign workers is a stunning confirmation that governments led by @entity13 , left , and @entity14 , right , deliberately engineered mass immigration his words are far franker than mr @entity25 ’s			1
asked earlier this month whether ‘ too many people were allowed to come ’ , he replied : ‘ i would n’t put it that way , no. ’ @entity102 chairman @entity101 said : ‘ @entity3 ’s candid admission that @entity8 were purposefully letting immigration spiral out of control when in government is yet another damning indictment on their record on immigration			2
’ sir @entity110 of @entity111 said : ‘ this is an astonishing admission from the highest level that @entity8 ’s mass immigration policy was entirely deliberate			1
‘ it will be a very long time before their own working class supporters forgive them for the enormous changes that have been imposed on their communities			0
’ @entity14 yesterday accused the @entity121 of emulating @entity122 by using immigration to head off the growing electoral threat from @entity125			0
mr @entity122 ’s 1968 ‘ rivers of blood ’ speech ignited huge controversy in the debate on immigration			0
former prime minister mr @entity14 – who once called for ‘ @entity6 jobs for @entity6 workers ’ – told a pro-union rally in @entity135 : ‘ a party that was anti-powellite on immigration is now becoming very close to being @entity138 on that issue			2
