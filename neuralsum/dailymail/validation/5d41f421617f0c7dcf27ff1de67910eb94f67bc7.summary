@entity0 hailed his crew of mechanics following a difficult day at the office that he claims left him ' heavily compromised ' ahead of this weekend 's @entity4			1
fresh from an @entity9 @entity4 ' triple crown ' of pole position , fastest lap and race win , @entity0 was forced to pull his mercedes to one side after just four installation laps in the first practice session at the @entity15			1
@entity11 mechanics fix @entity0 's car at the team 's garage after its engine failure on friday after the car was hauled back to the garage there were initial fears an engine change may be required , only for the fault to lie within the power unit inlet system			1
the depth of the issue within the system , however , meant @entity0 did not return to the track until 38 minutes into the 90 of @entity33			1
but the 30 - year - old wasted no time in getting up to speed as he went on to set the fastest lap , being the only driver to dip under 100 seconds with a time of one minute 39.790secs			1
' it was an amazing job done by my guys to rebuild the car , get the engine and gearbox back on and to get back out , ' said @entity0			2
' i am very grateful for that			0
especially here where it is so hot and so difficult for the tyres , so it was really important get back out			0
' @entity0 overcame the engine problems in the morning practice session to set the fastest time losing too much time , however , may yet prove costly as @entity0 added : ' it affects you quite a bit			1
' fortunately i got a few laps in with a longer run at the end , but in terms of my set - up , i have not made any changes and it is quite a bit off from where we need it			2
' overall , my preparations have been heavily compromised			1
whenever you lose a session , and most of the second session too , that definitely does n't help			2
' in the end , just to get some laps was crucial			0
if i had missed all of today then sunday would be hard			0
' right now i have some improvements to make to the balance and the settings , so i am sure we will tweak and improve it because we have not got the car dialled in			0
' but the @entity79 world champion says his @entity81 @entity4 preparations have been ' heavily compromised ' @entity84 's @entity83 was second quickest in both sessions , the @entity82 finishing 0.373secs adrift of @entity0 's team - mate @entity87 in @entity88 , and remarkably exactly the same time off the @entity89 in @entity33			1
although @entity84 are showing signs of closing in on @entity11 , @entity83 said : " the car is still not perfect , but i 'm sure we can improve for tomorrow			0
' we have some work to do on the set up to make everything easier , but we 'll do our best and we 'll see where we end up in qualifying			0
' @entity84 driver @entity83 during practice for the @entity81 @entity99 on friday @entity87 had to settle for third best , just over four tenths of a second behind @entity0 , followed by @entity103 's @entity102 and @entity105 duo @entity104 and @entity106			1
as for ailing @entity107 , the returning @entity108 was down in 16th , 2.7secs off the pace , closely followed by team - mate @entity111			2
@entity108 , who sat out the first race @entity113 as he recovered from concussion suffered in a crash in testing , claims @entity107 have progressed from where they were a fortnight ago in @entity118			2
the double world champion said : " it felt great in the car			1
' after the gym , the simulator , whatever you do it is not the same as the car , so i enjoyed so much driving here			0
@entity108 returns to the track after recovering from concussion he suffered in @entity9 crash ' it was really the second day of testing for me because i had one good day in @entity132 with 63 laps and then today with 45 laps			1
' and the car was much better than expected			0
the experience we had in winter we had a lot of problems after four or five laps			0
' but today we ran 45 laps with zero problems , everything went as we predicted			0
' we will see in qualifying where we are , but i think we were 4.6 seconds behind pole position in @entity9			2
' here , maybe we could be 3.5 seconds down , so that is a one second or 1.5 second gain in two weeks , so a big step forward			0
' @entity108 claims @entity107 have progressed from where they were a fortnight ago in @entity118 @entity149 also hit the track for the first time this season after months of uncertainty and missing @entity9 due to technical issues despite being present at the @entity156 circuit			1
rookie duo @entity157 and @entity158 completed 34 laps between them , with the @entity89 5.9secs down and the @entity162 7.4secs adrift , with the latter 's day cut short by a spin into the gravel .			0

@entity0 missed friday 's first session and some of the second
@entity0 still set the fastest time in @entity81 despite the engine failure
the world champion says preparations have been ' heavily compromised '
