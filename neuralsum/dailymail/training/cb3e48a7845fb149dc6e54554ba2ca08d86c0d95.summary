when i was seven my mother moved her lover into the house and my father stayed			1
it was very strange because it was a small house but they managed to live on separate circuits			2
' they stayed in this situation for four years			0
we lived in a small village with everyone gossiping about them and as soon as i put my foot outdoors everyone was asking me what was happening like ' who sleeps where ? ' ' i did not know why they were asking this question so i learnt to shut down and not to give anything away			0
i did not lie on their behalf i just stayed silent really			0
the @entity68 - winning novelist is currently having her work adapted for television in @entity71 's @entity19 ( pictured ) ' my real father became more and more like a ghost in our lives until he faded away entirely			1
at the time i had no idea he had gone			0
my mother for her own reasons had turned me against him and i believed he did not want any contact but now you see i do n't know whether that was true			1

i found he married again , a widow , and he had six children , five of them were girls			1
' the eldest daughter was the same age as me			0
she knew i existed but i did not know she did			0
by that time my father had died			1
she helped fill in some of the missing years and she gave me back very few of his possessions and his little travelling chess set which was the object in the whole world that i associated with him			0
it is quite damaged , battered by the years but inside were the chess men as they always were			0
' ms @entity10 also opened up about her struggle with her medical condition endometriosis and her inability to have children she also opened up about how she has struggled with her health since she was a teenager and how , for years , was left without a diagnosis			1

' when i was 27 i was discovered to have a gynaecological condition which affects young women which is quite common			2
but by the time the disease had been given a name a great deal of damage had been done to my body			0
it is something i have had to live with lifelong and it is only in the last few years that i have recovered my life			2
' it did influence the course of my life			2
i probably would not have been a writer if it had not been for this			0
when i was 22 i thought i must have a career and i started writing seriously but being in chronic pain does not make you saintly			0
' it makes you shut down and you only have a little bit of energy so you have to ration it and you work twice as hard as other people to prove you are good to other people			0
your life becomes just ambition and you do n't have any fun but i have had more fun in the last year than i have had in my life			2
