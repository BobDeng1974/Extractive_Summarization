by @entity1 reporter published : 12:06 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 : 12:06 est , 25 february 2014 two @entity5 teenagers are suffering from a kidney disease so rare that it was only diagnosed when the oldest boy was 18			1
@entity8 and @entity9 are both suffering from the life - threatening and incurable @entity10 , but despite a succession of doctor 's appointments their symptoms slipped under the radar			1
the genetic disorder is so rare , with fewer than 60,000 cases in the @entity19 , that medical staff struggled to piece together the symptoms			1
rare : @entity23 with her sons , @entity9 , left , and @entity8 , right , who both have @entity10 genetic : @entity9 and @entity8 's symptoms , including hearing loss , were not picked up until last year @entity8 , 18 , was finally diagnosed last year , after becoming so frail that his doctor feared he may have cancer			1
fewer than 60,000 people in the @entity19 have @entity10 , a genetic disorder that attacks the kidneys			1
early symptoms of the disease , which affects more men than women , is blood and protein in the urine			2
the disorder affects the connective tissues in the kidneys , but because the same tissue is found in the eyes and ears , sight loss and deafness are often early indicators of @entity10			1
@entity10 causes scarring to the kidneys and , as the sufferer gets older , signs of organ damage become more clear			1
the syndrome , if left unchecked , can cause kidney failure in teenagers and young adults			0
family history and a kidney biopsy are used to test for @entity10			0
no treatment is currently available for @entity10 , though patients are often prescribed medication that can slow the damage			0
kidney transplants and dialysis are often needed			1
at 6ft 2in , he weighed only 129 pounds and was pale			0
after being referred to @entity66 , he was found to have a rare disease that attacks the tissues in his kidneys			0
his kidneys were found to be failing fast and the 18 - year - old is currently on a transplant list			1
his brother 's symptoms were not so advanced and , for now , he has been prescribed medication			0
however , with no cure , both boys have been told to expect to undergo several kidney transplants in their lifetime			1
signs that the boys may have @entity10 were first noticeable before they were even born			2
their mother , @entity80 , is believed to have passed the gene that causes the disorder to her sons			2
' when i was 2 the doctors found protein and blood in my urine			0
they did many tests over the years but they were never able to explain it , ' mrs @entity23 told @entity91			2
when they were growing up , her sons also both tested positive regularly for blood and protein in their urine , but the signals of @entity10 were missed			0
even when they both lost their hearing during elementary school - a common side effect of the syndrome - doctors failed to pick up a more sinister problem			2
when @entity10 was finally diagnosed the family struggled to find information about it			2
when it was finally spotted in @entity8 , his parents were given a printout at the hospital			1
diagnosed : @entity8 's symptoms were recognized when his parents became concerned about his weight waiting list : @entity8 , 18 , is waiting for a kidney transplant life - changing : @entity8 , left , and younger brother @entity9 , 16 , may need several kidney transplants ' when they tell you your child has a rare disease you know nothing about and then they send you to the @entity120 , i ca n't describe the raw emotion , ' mrs @entity23 said , adding that she felt anxious and guilty at first			1
@entity122 , of the @entity123 , said that the family 's experience was typical			0
the syndrome is so rare it is known as an ' orphan disease ' because it affects so few people			0
its symptoms are also found in other diseases , making an early diagnosis difficult unless it has already been found in another family members			0
but dr @entity133 , executive director of the @entity134 and @entity135 at the @entity136 in @entity137 , said : ' early hearing loss , blood in the urine and history of kidney failure are all red flags			0
' campaign : the @entity146 family , pictured above on vacation , want to raise awareness about the disorder the syndrome usually begins by affecting the eyesight and hearing of sufferers , before moving on to the kidneys during the teenage years			2
for now , @entity8 and @entity9 are getting the help they need to manage the effects of the syndrome , but both face needing several transplants and dialysis			1
' if more doctors were aware of this disease , my kids ' kidneys could have been protected much sooner , ' mrs @entity23 said			0
' a little more knowledge on their part would have meant a lot less heartache on mine			0

@entity8 and @entity9 were diagnosed with life - threatening disorder last year
@entity176 told the boys will need several organ transplants during their lives
