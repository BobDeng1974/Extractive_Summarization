@entity0 has insisted the furore surrounding the launch of assistant @entity4 's updated autobiography will not distract the @entity5 from their @entity7 mission			1
the @entity5 boss met the media in @entity10 on tuesday lunchtime after he and @entity4 had put the players through their paces for the first time since they met up ahead of the qualifiers against @entity16 and @entity17			1
however , they did so with the younger man once again making the headlines after copies of his book @entity22 were mistakenly put on sale briefly on monday ahead of thursday 's official launch			1
@entity4 made the headlines this week after the release of his controversial updated autobiography @entity5 boss @entity0 said the publicity surrounding @entity4 's book will not be a distraction @entity4 's book , @entity22 , contains explosive content aimed at various people throughout his career but if @entity4 's differences with former @entity43 manager sir @entity42 , his decision to turn down the job as @entity37 manager and a clash with one - time team - mate @entity39 were among the topics dominating the sports news agenda , @entity0 was refusing to be side - tracked			1
he said : " the most important issue here are our games , and saturday [ the match against @entity16 ] is really , really important			0
we have come off the back of a great win against @entity53 and it 's important to focus on that			0
" whatever headline ... let 's just say we came here and there had n't been a book - there would have been something else , seriously			1
" he [ @entity4 ] would have slipped down there on the field and we 'd have been talking about that , maybe broken his leg or something like that			2
there would have been something			0
" there will always be something here in the lead - up to games , and that i can guarantee			0
the @entity79 's latest publication reveals more on the deterioration of his relationship with sir @entity42 the former @entity43 captain also wrote of problems with goalkeeper @entity39 @entity4 had a volatile relationship with @entity85 but revealed he respects the former @entity87 captain " i genuinely do n't know what the headlines are in the book			1
it obviously was going to cause some sort of furore at some stage or another - the very fact he put his name to this book would suggest that it 's exactly what would happen			2
" it 's there and it does n't matter			0
the games are the most important things for us			0
" asked if he had discussed the book with @entity4 in advance , @entity0 said : " i thought about it at one stage or another but then , why ? he 's over 21 - i think - and he should be capable of dealing with his own stuff			1
" @entity0 , who asked @entity4 to join him in the republic set - up when he was appointed in november last year , has had to become used to the focus he attracts ever since , with the approach from @entity37 and @entity117 's subsequent successful attempt to appoint him as @entity119 's assistant during the summer cases in point			1
away from all the media attention @entity4 was busy putting the @entity5 players through their paces on tuesday lunchtime ahead of the qualifiers against @entity16 and @entity17 however , while much of his own time in front of the media is spent fielding questions about his number two , he is adamant it is not an issue for him			1
" not necessarily , not at all , " @entity0 said			2
" he 's an iconic figure			0
he 's been here for a long time - you know that			2
he was an absolutely fantastic footballer and now he 's making his way in management			0
" @entity0 was in relaxed mood as he was quizzed about @entity4 's book , and even joked about the former @entity5 captain 's burgeoning beard after recently jokingly questioning the sartorial elegance - or otherwise - of the @entity146 media pack			1
asked if he would be having a word with the 43 - year - old , he said : " well i must admit , i might well do because he looks really bedraggled			1
there is no doubt at all about it but i think he wants to join your group , so i think that 's the essence of it			0
" the @entity5 will be taking on @entity16 and @entity17 in their upcoming @entity7 qualifiers @entity156 ( right ) says there have been a few jokes made within the @entity146 camp about @entity4 's book within the camp , the players too were taking all the fuss in their stride			1
former @entity43 midfielder @entity156 said : " there have been a few comments , but nobody 's talking about it			0
the lads just get on with it			0
there have been a few jokes made around the table , but , like i said , nothing serious			0
" i have not seen any of the comments , to be honest with you , so i 'm in no position to be comment on it			0
" asked if @entity4 is the type of assistant whose leg players can pull , @entity156 replied with a smile : " i 've not tried			2
i 'll let you try first			0
" meanwhile , @entity0 has called 20 - year - old @entity182 defender @entity181 into his squad after losing @entity184 , as well as @entity185 and @entity186 , due to injury for the double - header			1
