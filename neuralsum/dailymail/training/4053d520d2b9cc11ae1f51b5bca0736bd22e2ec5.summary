by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 5 april 2013 golden goodbye : @entity2 @entity2 , the @entity3 ’s foreign policy chief , is in line to rake in £ 400,000 over three years from @entity6 taxpayers – without having to do any work			1
her job ends next year and her generous golden goodbye will amount to £ 133,500 a year – the equivalent of 55 per cent of her £ 287,543 salary – until the end of 2017			1
on leaving office , the high representative of foreign affairs will immediately get one month ’s salary , or £ 23,962			1
she will then receive more than half her annual salary for the next three years			1
when she reaches retirement age in 2021 , she will become eligible for her @entity3 pension which will be worth £ 61,000 a year			1
her pay - off was immediately attacked by @entity22 , with one claiming that she should actually be paying taxpayers back based on her performance			1
@entity2 has been heavily criticised by the government over what ministers have described as her ‘ ludicrous ’ demands for massive budget increases at a time of austerity			1
her running of the @entity3 ’s diplomatic service has also been questioned by @entity34 from across @entity6 , who have been unimpressed with the high rates of absenteeism and the hefty rates of pay for officials that are now commonplace in @entity41			0
bureaucrats stepped in to defend her ‘ transitional allowance ’ , saying it was ‘ the price for the total independence ’ of all the senior officials working in @entity6			0
one even claimed the pay - off was ‘ important ’ because it stopped commissioners from looking for a new job during the last months of their mandate			0
last month , @entity2 said she found the role of high representative ‘ exhausting ’ because it involved ‘ a lot of travel and a lot of sitting on planes ’			1
when she steps down , the @entity61 peer will have to ask for permission to take any new job for up to 18 months after leaving the post			2
but she will only lose some of her taxpayer - funded deal if she lands work that pays her more than £ 134,000 a year			2
her new allowance will be taxed at a lower @entity3 community tax rate of just 13.5 per cent			0
and she will also be able to immediately attend the @entity69			2
outspoken : @entity70 , the leader of the @entity72 @entity71 , said that @entity73 just goes to prove the @entity41 pay formula this means she will receive a daily rate of £ 300 simply for clocking in and attending debates			2
a @entity80 spokesman defended her bumper pay - off			0
saying : ‘ it ’s important that commissioners do n’t start looking for a new job during the last months of their mandate			0
’ he added : ‘ they should take their time over finding appropriate new employment			0
‘ that way , they can continue to give 100 per cent to the job that taxpayers are paying them to do			2
complaints : @entity96 said that if the @entity99 's pay was performance related she would be writing out a cheque to @entity102 ‘ and there is much less risk of a conflict of interest			2
’ @entity96 , the @entity96 mp for @entity106 , said : ‘ the system is run by , and for the benefit of those troughing officials who work in @entity41			0
‘ if @entity2 got proper performance - related pay , she would be writing a cheque out to @entity102			1
’ @entity70 , the leader of the @entity72 @entity71 , said : ‘ @entity73 just goes to prove the @entity41 pay formula			0
‘ eurocrats are paid huge amounts of money inversely to the amount of work they do or the little good that they achieve			0
’ the former @entity122 vice chair was elevated to the @entity69 as @entity2 of @entity123 by the @entity61 government in 1999			1
she was briefly @entity125 in 2007 , before being dispatched to @entity41 the following year			0
she started by taking over from @entity126 as the @entity3 ’s trade commissioner			0
@entity2 then became the first person to take on the role of the @entity3 ’s high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy in 2009			1
after her first year in the post , @entity2 was voted the least useful of all the @entity3 commissioners in a survey of more than 320 @entity6 policymakers .			1

@entity2 will rake in £ 400,000 over three years from @entity140 taxpayers
on leaving office she will immediately bank one month 's salary of £ 23,000
