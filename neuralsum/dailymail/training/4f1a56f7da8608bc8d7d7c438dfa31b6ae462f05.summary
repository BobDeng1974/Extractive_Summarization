by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:27 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 4 march 2013 @entity3 ministers have promised benefits for @entity6 migrants will be protected , it has emerged as the row over who receives state handouts intensifies			1
the @entity3 government is understood to be drawing up emergency plans to curb the benefits which can be claimed by new arrivals			1
healthcare , housing and child benefit could be limited to only those people who have lived in @entity3 for more than a year			1
ministers want to get to grips with the issue before the expected influx of thousands of @entity6 and @entity23 next year once @entity25 restrictions are lifted but @entity6 foreign minister @entity26 claims to have ' received official assurances from the @entity28 ' that @entity25 rules on benefits would not be changed			1
' we do n’t speak about the @entity6 as migrants , they are @entity33 citizens , we are @entity33 citizens , we are members of the @entity25 so we have our legitimate rights according to the @entity25 treaties , ' he told @entity36			1
however , a special @entity38 committee of senior minister are looking at ways to limit the impact on the taxpayer of thousands of @entity6 and @entity23 arriving next year once @entity25 restrictions are lifted			1
however , it means @entity3 could have to carry an ‘ entitlement card ’ to access free @entity44 care as part of a crackdown on health tourists			1
@entity6 foreign minister @entity26 claims @entity3 ministers reassured him that benefits would not be curbed reforms under discussion could mean immigrants having to wait six months or even a year before being granted habitual residency and therefore hospital care			1
@entity56 mp @entity55 urged minister to ' take a chance ' and limit access to benefits for immigrants because a @entity62 ruling on the legaility of such a move would take years			1
' we ’ve got to be robust , as they are in @entity68 , they are using the free movement directive to the nth degree , ' he told @entity72 's @entity71			0
' we have to do that to protect the access to public services and our employment market			2
it ’s important to recognise that the free movement directive is not a tablet of stone , its quite a flexible document , and ministers should have been looking at this issue months , not years ago			2
' local residents could also jump the queue for council housing under a plan to give preferential treatment to people with strong ties to local areas			2
today @entity93 said the idea is one of a ' range of options ' being considered to limit access to benefits			1
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' there is an ongoing process of considering a range of options by the @entity38 sub committee , the prime minister chaired a meeting of it recently			1
it is looking at a number of ideas			0
' we are not at the announcements stage			0
we have to operate within the law , including the the @entity25 single market law and yes it 's my understanding that one ca n't discriminate between @entity25 nationals under that law			0
' he added that the moves by the government were designed to address growing public unease about the prospect of thousands of new migrants arriving in the @entity3			1
' there 's a widespread public concern around pressures around some services both in housing services and the @entity44 there 's a widespread sense of concern , ' the spokesman added			1
a cross-government committee chaired by @entity56 immigration minister @entity137 is examining a raft of ideas about how the curbs could be introduced , although details remain vague			2
other members include health , justice , treasury , housing , schools , transport and foreign ministers			1
ill - fated : @entity151 's id card plan failed any plan to limit healthcare to those who can prove they are entitled to free care would involve them presenting a card at the point of treatment			1
however , the idea could spark civil liberty concerns akin to the opposition to @entity151 ’s plans to impose an identity card			0
and any plans to change the habitual residency test could be controversial			0
@entity169 general secretary @entity168 said : ' alarm bells should be ringing			0
the concern must be that the government is set to limit benefits and access to the @entity44 under the cover of @entity6 and @entity23 gaining the right to work here			1
' the government must spell out its plans in full detail and come clean on which people living in the @entity3 will lose out			2
ministers must also clarify whether those , such as @entity3 pensioners who have moved to @entity68 , will see their eligibility to health treatment affected too			1
' the @entity185 is already unhappy that the @entity3 has imposed such a test to prevent immigrants gaining access to all benefits and would be likely to oppose a plan to extend the test to entitlement to @entity44 care			1
@entity194 , @entity151 mp for @entity196 , and @entity197 , @entity56 mp for @entity198 , who co-chairman a cross-party parliamentary group on balanced migration , have written a letter to @entity204 to outline their proposal			0
they told the health secretary to ‘ get this situation dealt with very soon ’ to avoid a public backlash			0
the idea would be welcomed by many doctors who say they find it difficult to ask people whether they are entitled to @entity44 care for fear of appearing racist			2
conservative plans to clamp down on immigrants ’ access to free healthcare will be seen as an another attempt by the party to steal a march on @entity224 after their second place in last week ’s @entity227			2
@entity224 leader @entity228 claimed they pushed the @entity230 into third because @entity232 was too busy talking about issues such as wind turbines and gay marriage rather than immigration			0
mr @entity232 has confirmed previous reports that he is backing plans to clamp down on immigrants ’ access to free healthcare			2
he wants to do this by changing the ‘ habitual residency test ’ , which is used to refuse certain benefits to immigrants			2
at present , it gives full access to @entity44 care to anyone permanently resident in the @entity3			1
@entity246 , @entity245 , would like to see a habitual residence test for all handouts in addition , hospitals will be compelled to enforce current rules which mean tourists and others who have no right to free care – including failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants – are charged for any services they receive on the @entity44			2
a source close to mr @entity204 said there was concern that the @entity44 was being exploited by ‘ more and more ’ people from overseas , putting a strain on services			0
‘ the @entity44 is becoming the global health service , ’ the source said			0
‘ we are looking at the way in which services are open to people			0
you have to be ordinarily resident to access healthcare			0
‘ we have to have a look at that and whether there is a prospect of changing that			0
we are looking in a bit more detail at the contributions you need [ to have paid ] to be entitled to free healthcare			0
’ the habitual residence test is used to decide whether migrants from the @entity25 and elsewhere are eligible for certain benefits			0
last month work and pensions secretary @entity246 said he wanted to see the test extended to all handouts , so that no one can claim a benefit unless they can show they have rented a home here for at least a year			1
@entity151 's @entity292 , the shadow immigration minister , said : ' this government has spent the weekend flying more kites than @entity295			0
' managing immigration in a fair way is really important			0
yet what we are getting from the government is just an unseemly reaction to threats from their backbenches			0

@entity6 foreign minister @entity26 claims to have ' received official assurances from the @entity28 ' that handouts would continue
@entity3 ministers *plotting* emergency *measures* to limit benefits for *newcomers*
care may be restricted to those who have lived in @entity3 more than a year
access to housing and out - of - work benefits could also be limited
@entity93 warns of ' widespread concern ' about *big* influx from @entity6 and @entity321 when restrictions are lifted next year
