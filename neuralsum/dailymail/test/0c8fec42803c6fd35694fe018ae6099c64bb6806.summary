campaigners are calling for the government to implement an almost 90 - year - old law that would fix the date of @entity4 in a bid to boost the economy			1
after next month 's election , ministers could be asked to make sure @entity9 always falls between april 9 and 15 , so businesses can plan holiday rotas in advance and allow the travel industry to better prepare for the summer season			1
in 1928 , the @entity4 act was passed in @entity16 to make sure that the holiday weekend would be a fixed date in april			1
after next month 's general election , minister could be asked to consider fixing the date of @entity4 both the @entity26 and @entity27 passed the @entity28 but it was unable to get the agreement of churches and therefore has never been implemented			1
it is thought that the @entity33 did not object to the plans although , they were never seriously discussed			0
but just before the dissolution of @entity16 last week , conservative sir @entity35 , who is defending his @entity37 seat at the general election , asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the @entity43			1
this also prompted the @entity45 to write to prime minister @entity19 demanding @entity4 be a set date in april			1

it is thought that the @entity33 do not object to the plans to fix a date for @entity4 the letter by the society 's executive director @entity54 , said : ' the variation of the date of @entity4 by over a month causes significant and unnecessary inconvenience			2
this is particularly disruptive to the orderly planning of school terms and to business			0
' as you will be aware , the law requires large shops , including supermarkets and even @entity68 stores , to close on @entity9			2
' the high proportion of the population that are not observant @entity71 , be they religiously unconcerned or of other faiths , are prevented from using them then , when many would want to do so			0
' we support the rights of those who wish to observe @entity4 , but is is unreasonable and disrespectful to the remainder of the population for the operation of the law to prevent them from shopping then in such outlets			0
' spectators gather to watch the @entity84 production on @entity85 in @entity86			0
but just before the dissolution of @entity16 , conservative sir @entity35 asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the @entity43			2
on the gregorian calendar , used in the @entity92 , @entity9 always falls on the first sunday after the @entity94 full moon the @entity95 and the @entity96 and @entity97 have also backed the plan , saying that at least the two - week @entity4 school holidays should be the same every year to allow parents to plan childcare			1
however , according to the independent business minister @entity102 said there was ' no indication ' that @entity4 would become a fixed date			1
on the gregorian calendar , used in the @entity92 , @entity9 is always the first sunday after the @entity94 full moon			2
the @entity94 full moon is the first full moon occurring on or after the spring equinox , meaning @entity4 weekend usually falls any time between march 22 and april 25			2
but since this shifts from year to year , most people follow the calendrical spring equinox , which is reckoned as march 21			0
in the @entity112 , @entity4 is determined using the @entity113 and is always celebrated after the @entity115 festival of @entity116			0
this year it will be celebrated on april 12 , next sunday .			0
