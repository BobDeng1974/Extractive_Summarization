by @entity1 reporter when it comes to fighting for tv viewers , @entity2 and @entity3 think they ’re pretty important to tv viewers and have spent the last year or so fighting for a piece of advertisers ’ budgets			0
however , new research from the @entity12 - affiliated @entity11 suggests that most people do n't pay any attention to social media at all when they tune in to their favorite shows			2
the study found that despite shows attempting to build a presence on social media and encourage ' chatter ' , most are only checking such sites about 16 percent of the time we watch primetime tv shows			1
whilst brands put a lot of time and effort into primetime ads when the biggest audience numbers are up for grabs , viewers only end up chatting about the show half the time			0
@entity2 and @entity3 still have a long way to go to become part of the mainstream tv consumption experience of the 16.1 percent of respondents who claimed to use social media while watching tv , 7.3 reported their social media activity was related to the show they were watching , but 7.8 percent said their social media use was unrelated to a particular tv show @entity44 possible ? listen to executives at @entity2 and @entity3 talk about how we watch television and you might walk away thinking that @entity49 are chattering nonstop on the social networks while watching their favorite shows only 16.1 percent of survey respondents claimed to have used social media while watching prime time television			1
1,665 survey participants were instructed to log any social posts about a prime time tv show , as well as any time they discussed a tv show on their social networks			1
the study ’s findings were based on 78,310 diary entries covering nearly 1,600 shows reported via a mobile app supplied by the research group			0
the survey found that just 6.8 percent of people tuned into a show because of a social media conversation			2
that number was far lower than other , more general factors pushing people to turn on a show , as about 40 percent said tv commercials sent them to watch , and 30 percent said they already watched that show previously			2
the figures may not be wholly convincing for advertising who believe such social media networks are the way to reach their loyal followers			1
@entity3 was most popular with 11.4 percent of survey respondents actively engaging on the network			0
@entity2 users measured almost less than a third of @entity3 users it seems that social media has very little impact on whether people actually watch tv shows @entity3 ceo and founder @entity93 has earned billions from his company , which has recently been valued at $ 150 billion @entity2 ’s @entity97 program allows broadcasters to send promotional tweets when you begin to talk about a tv show			1
if @entity103 knows you ’re tweeting about @entity104 , it can insert a promotional tweet in your feed from a particular advertiser			0
@entity3 also introduced something similar and uses @entity110 data to reach audience members that it believes are in its target demographic for advertisers			0
of the social media platforms being used during prime time television viewing , @entity3 was the most popular with 11.4 percent of survey respondents actively engaging on the network			1
@entity2 users measured almost less than a third of @entity3 users , with only 3.3 percent of the survey respondents using @entity2 during their tv viewing time			0
the survey showed that people only use @entity3 to chat about their favorite prime time show 3.8 per cent of the time and @entity2 even less , just 1.8 per cent			2
award shows appear to draw more social media buzz and the numbers of users both watching tv and using social media at the same time are higher			1
one only needs to look at how popular @entity135 's record - breaking @entity134 selfie was			0
other shows that reach a climax such as @entity138 or the @entity139 , also generate ' watercooler discussion ' more than regular shows			0
@entity142 surveyed 1,700 people between the ages of 15 and 54 that were ' representative of the online population			0
' the data was self - reported using mobile - app diary entries			0
despite making a later push into social tv , @entity3 performs slightly better on this front			0
some 3.8 % of primetime viewers in the study used @entity3 to talk about the show they were watching at that moment compared to just 1.8 % for @entity2 the selfie heard round the world : @entity135 's @entity157 generated more free buzz and marketing oomph than pretty much anything , ever , in the company 's history			2
the picture is reportedly worth $ 1 billion the data shows the type of shows most influenced by social media , with special programs at the top of the list , followed by @entity172 and sports shows the survey confirms a previous @entity12 study that found social media conversation drives some tv ratings but that the impact is fairly small			1
this new study backs up such findings			0
the study found that those who engage on social media about the shows they 're watching tend to be more likely to binge watch programs and consume tv shows on tablets and smartphones			1
' the majority of viewing remains live and on traditional tv sets , but we do see that social media has a stronger relationship with the newer platforms and behaviors , ' @entity191 chair @entity190 said			2
' this is evidence that social media is an important part of the new ways that people are consuming television content			2
' commercials and traditional promos were the top factor in what drew people to watch a particular show with nearly 40 % of those surveyed saying this led them to watch a new show			1
by comparison , just 6.8 % of respondents cited social media of people who chatted on social media while watching tv , just 3.3 percent did so through @entity2 , well below @entity3 at 11.4 percent			1
it 's not to say that viewers are not engaging with social media whilst watching tv , they are			1
just not at the levels that @entity2 recently discussed			0
social networks essentially twist their data so show the most positive statistics			2
they promote the ' most - tweeted ' shows which are popular amongst the ' most active ' users			0
' @entity227 , ' or people who regularly used social media to follow tv shows or actors , made up 22 percent of the survey respondents			1
it is this small group of people whom social media advertising is probably the most effective , rather than most tv viewers who are simply looking for something to pass the time .			1

social networks believe there are advertising *opportunities* in our tv habits
just 16.1 % of those surveyed use social media while watching prime time
only 1 in 5 @entity49 's are reached by social media when it comes to tv shows
most of us do not tweet or post while watching television
promos and commercials are also more effective at making us want to watch a tv show than any social media campaign or advert
