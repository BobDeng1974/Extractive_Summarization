by @entity0 a child with severe cerebral palsy has learned to sit up unsupported , to walk with a frame and to crawl unaided after joining a special school where his brain is ‘ retrained ’			1
@entity6 , seven , had problems eating and could not control his head , roll over or sit up until he became a student at @entity10 in @entity11			1
the charity , which offers specialised education for children with motor disorders , helps to ‘ retrain ’ the brains of children like @entity6 so as to bypass the damaged areas and teach others parts to substitute for them			1
@entity6 , seven , was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was just a few weeks old @entity6 ’s mother , @entity22 , 38 , from @entity23 in @entity11 , said : ‘ it really works and @entity6 has come on so much			1
‘ for me personally , it is remarkable			0
he ’s so much more active and he enjoys social interaction whereas before he was almost scared			0
‘ he is now much happier and he enjoys going to school			0
’ @entity6 was born two months early , at just 30 weeks gestation , and when he was born he was unresponsive			1
he had to be delivered using forceps after miss @entity22 unexpectedly went into premature labour			0
when he was delivered he was not breathing properly – he was in respiratory distress			0
until he was three , @entity6 was unable to sit up unaided , crawl , walk or hold up his own head as a result , he was rushed to the hospital ’s special care baby unit and was put on a respirator			1
it is still not known why he was born so early but he had to spend seven and a half weeks in hospital before he was able to go home			2
miss @entity22 said : ‘ we are very lucky to have him – he is a wonderful lad			0
’ she added : ‘ we knew from a very early age that he would be disabled – we were told when he was seven weeks old that he had brain damage and would probably have cerebral palsy			1
’ cerebral palsy is a general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination			1
these conditions are caused by a problem in the part of the brain responsible for controlling muscles			0
the condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or if it is damaged before , during or shortly after birth			2
causes of cerebral palsy include an infection caught by the mother during pregnancy , a difficult or premature birth , bleeding in the brain and gene mutations			1
it is thought that in the @entity69 about one in every 400 people is affected			0
symptoms include muscle stiffness or floppiness , muscle weakness , uncontrolled body movements and balance and co-ordination problems			0
symptoms vary in severity from one person to another - some only have minor problems while others are severely disabled			0
some patients also have seizures , swallowing problems , difficulties with communications and learning difficulties			0
there is no cure but patients can benefit from physiotherapy and occupational therapy			0
source : @entity96 @entity6 failed to meet any of his developmental milestones and had problems eating and drinking , had a squint , was unable to control his head and could not walk , talk or sit up			1
he was also hypersensitive to touch and to loud noises meaning he became distressed if he was exposed to loud sounds and when he touched something unexpectedly			0
when he was three years old , @entity6 started attending @entity10 in @entity106 after @entity107 was told about it by a health visitor and it was recommended by another parent			1
the charity provides an innovative education for children with motor disorders , such as cerebral palsy			1
the centre provides a rounded education for children while making the most of the plasticity of children 's brains			0
it attempts to ' retrain ' children 's brains while they are still very malleable so that some of the undamaged parts learn to take over the function of some of the damaged parts			1
it does this through repetition - encouraging children to carry out the same movements again and again until they are able to do them			2
the centre also offers physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help with the children 's development			0
miss @entity22 said : ‘ within five minutes of going to @entity10 we were hooked			2
‘ straight away we knew it was the right place for @entity6			2
we knew we wanted him to be there because of the positivity – at @entity10 they immediately offered to try and help @entity6 and we liked that about it			2
’ she added : ‘ @entity6 is probably not going to be able to live a totally independent life , but we feel much more positive about the future			2
‘ when he was first born we were given details of a bleak and uncertain future but he is now highly motivated and has made massive achievements since he started to attend @entity10 and we feel this will continue as he gets older			2
’ @entity6 attends the centre full - time and has come on in leaps and bounds			2
miss @entity22 told @entity153 : ‘ he has become so strong by doing the activities daily			0
when he was three , @entity6 started attending a special school called @entity10			1
here specialists have worked on ' retraining ' his brain so that the parts that are undamaged take on some of the function of the damaged parts ‘ it has improved him so much and i believe it will continue to do so			1
’ she went on to explain that he is still unable to talk but that he can communicate by using a picture and word book			0
she said he used to get frustrated when people could n’t understand him but that he is now much happier and that he is also able to move around on his own by crawling or using a walking frame			0
she explained that he also no longer becomes distressed by loud noises and that he can sit up and hold his head up independently			0
he also now has much greater use of his hands which used to be clenched			0
miss @entity22 said : ‘ every child with cerebral palsy has the right to this sort of intervention			2
@entity6 is now able to sit up unaided , to hold his head up , to crawl and to walk with a frame ‘ i do n’t know where we ’d have been if @entity6 had n’t gone to @entity10 – thanks to the school he will now be able to lead as independent a life as is possible for him			1
’ she added : ‘ @entity10 has helped us to understand cerebral palsy – now i understand why he used to react in certain ways			1
‘ there has been such a transformation – people always notice the huge changes in him when they have n’t seen him for a while			0
‘ they really have made a huge difference to him			0
’ miss @entity22 does not believe that @entity6 will ever be able to live independently but she is confident that he will continue to improve at @entity10			2
she said : ‘ i believe that he may well be able to speak and to become physically stronger			0
@entity6 's mother , @entity22 , says that the change in @entity6 has been amazing since he started at the school ‘ i do n’t think he will ever live independently but i do hope he will have some degree of independence			2
’ miss @entity22 is now supporting a new campaign and parliamentary inquiry focused on getting a better deal for children with cerebral palsy across the whole country			1
the campaign is being organised by @entity210 which is a consortium of charities working with children with cerebral palsy , including @entity10			1
one of the primary objectives of the campaign is to call for more consistent access to early and intensive support - such as that offered by @entity10 and which @entity6 is lucky enough to have access to			1
@entity6 's parents do not believe that he will ever be able to live independently but they hope he will continue to improve while he is at pace @entity219 , chair of @entity210 said : ' we see every day the amazing progress that children with cerebral palsy can make , given the right support			1
‘ but we are fully aware that only a small proportion of the 1,800 children born with cerebral palsy every year receive the early and intensive intervention that can transform their lives			1
‘ by joining forces , we aim to get a better deal for all children with cerebral palsy			1
' the campaign is also fighting for the earliest possible diagnosis for people with cerebral palsy and better training for professionals working with children with the condition			1

@entity6 , seven , was born two months early and struggling to breathe
his parents , @entity248 and @entity249 , were told he had suffered brain damage
they were also told that he would probably have cerebral palsy
by the age of three he could *n't* walk , talk , crawl or sit up unaided
he then started at a special school for children with *disabilities* - @entity10
there , specialists use repetition to teach undamaged parts of his brain to take over the function of some of the damaged parts
he can now sit up , walk with a frame , crawl and communicate
