sir @entity0 , trustee of the bureau behind the @entity3 report that led to the smearing of @entity5 disturbing questions have been raised about the role of a senior adviser to the @entity9			1
sir @entity0 is on the six - strong panel of assessors assisting @entity12 , whose report into press standards is expected within weeks			1
but a @entity16 investigation has uncovered evidence that questions both his suitability as an adviser and the impact this may have had on the objectivity and neutrality of the @entity9			2
sir @entity0 is a trustee of the @entity25 , the group behind the disastrous @entity3 report that falsely implicated @entity5 as a paedophile			1
with his lawyers preparing to sue the @entity25 for damages , the former @entity29 treasurer yesterday described the devastating impact on him of the programme that has left the @entity34 in crisis , with the resignation of its director general			0
the 70 - year - old spoke of how the shattering allegations had consigned him ‘ to the lowest circle of hell ’ and said it had made him ‘ a figure of public hatred ’			2
the @entity34 last night agreed to pay @entity5 £ 185,000 plus legal costs			0
this was followed by a grudging apology from the @entity25 , which read : ‘ the bureau ’s trustees apologise to @entity5 for the extent to which its contribution to the @entity3 broadcast on 2 november fell short of the high standards it expects and for any incorrect speculation about the identity of the politician that may have been encouraged by the bureau managing editor ’s tweet in advance of the broadcast			1
’ at the @entity9 , the @entity25 , which bragged it was the gold standard of investigative journalism , proposed a media levy that would force newspapers to fund groups such as itself			1
as well as the bureau , sir @entity0 is co-founder of the @entity71 , the lobby group behind a huge amount of evidence presented to the @entity12 inquiry			1
the @entity71 , which sir @entity0 chaired until recently , subsequently spawned hacked off – the campaign group demanding press reform fronted by actor @entity77 and comedian @entity78 – which has boasted of its role in considerably expanding the @entity9 ’s original remit			1
sir @entity0 ’s friend and @entity71 co-founder is @entity84 with whom he heads an organisation called @entity86 which receives millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money from public servants sent on ‘ leadership ’ training courses			1
it is described as the @entity94 ’s answer to the old boys ’ network			0
sir @entity0 is co-founder of @entity71			1
people associated with the trust gave some of the most vehement anti-press evidence at @entity12 a number of prominent politicians and public figures have expressed concern over @entity12 's ( pictured ) inquiry into press standards calls for statutory regulation two more of @entity12 ’s panel of advisers , @entity111 chairman @entity108 and sir @entity112 , ex-chief constable of @entity113 , have indirect connections with @entity86			1
the @entity16 investigation has uncovered an incestuous network of political , business and financial links between sir @entity0 , ex-chairman of the @entity120 , and individuals and organisations appearing before the @entity9 to demand statutory press regulation			1
it reveals : @entity29 mp @entity125 , who sits on the @entity126 , said : ‘ this is about a lot of people of dubious intentions setting up organisations to push their own opinions and inveigle their way into positions of influence			0
they are simply promoting their own ideological agenda in a surreptitious manner			0
‘ it makes you wonder , if we had statutory regulation of the press , just who would be sitting on such a body			0
’ @entity86 , which once shared the same headquarters as the @entity71 , charges up to £ 5,000 for a week - long course and claims more than 35,000 have ‘ graduated ’ in the @entity148 and worldwide			1
the @entity34 spent more than £ 126,000 in a five - year period on its courses			0
among senior police officer ‘ graduates ’ of @entity86 is @entity153 , the @entity154 commander in charge of the bungled operation that ended with the 2005 shooting of innocent @entity159 @entity158			2
it was miss @entity153 who personally chose deputy assistant commissioner @entity162 to head the investigation into phone - hacking and payments to police and public officials at @entity168			0
power : @entity125 mp raised concerns about the impartiality of those who would oversee regulation of the press another lucrative connection between the police and @entity86 involves the @entity178			0
the force sent 27 @entity181 officers , including one assistant chief constable , on @entity86 courses under sir @entity112 ’s leadership			0
@entity185 peer @entity108 was the first chairman of @entity187 and the media regulator also sent people on the courses			2
two of his board members have been involved with either the @entity71 or @entity193			0
the @entity16 sent detailed questions to sir @entity0 , @entity108 and sir @entity112 but none replied			2
the @entity9 issued a statement on their behalf , saying : ‘ before the assessors were formally appointed to their role they were each asked to declare any issues they felt might cause a conflict to arise with their position on the @entity9			0
‘ as part of that process , each assessor discussed those matters with @entity12 and provided a written declaration accordingly			2
‘ he was satisfied then that there was nothing in their disclosures which caused him concern or justified any of them not taking up this role			0
’ common purpose chief executive miss @entity84 said : ‘ i am proud of my private and personal association with the @entity71 , started by many people in response to widespread feelings that increased transparency in the media should be encouraged			1
’ she said none of the organisations she was connected with had a role in selecting the assessors .			0

sir @entity0 's suitability as senior adviser to @entity9 under *scrutiny*
sir @entity0 is a trustee of the *tarnished* @entity25
@entity25 behind the *disgraced* @entity3 probe that implicated @entity5
many of the witnesses who provided the most *hostile* anti-press evidence to @entity12 are linked to senior figures at @entity193 and the @entity71 ;
significant funding for the @entity71 comes from a *charitable* trust of which sir @entity0 is a trustee ;
the @entity71 has links with @entity187 , the statutory media regulator which some *suspect* has *ambitions* to regulate @entity148 ’s free press ;
despite being formed by the @entity71 , which is campaigning for ‘ transparency and *accountability* in the news ’ , hacked off *refuses* to detail the source of its own funding ;
the ‘ *prestigious* ’ @entity71 - administered @entity259 for political writing was handed to a journalist who turned out to have made up his ‘ award - winning ’ *articles* ;
@entity86 is ‘ likely ’ to have *breached* the @entity266 – the charge levelled at the @entity9 against virtually all newspapers ;
it has strong links with powerful and *controversial* lobby and pr groups ;
common purpose ‘ leaders ’ have had a significant influence on the appointments process in @entity275 .
