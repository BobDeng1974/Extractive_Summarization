by @entity0 published : 14:14 est , 28 november 2013 @entity2 : 14:26 est , 28 november 2013 pollution makes thunderstorms worse by creating bigger , longer lasting clouds and cooling temperatures with their shadows , say scientists			1
computer simulations of cloud data from the @entity11 , south eastern @entity12 and @entity13 showed pollution increased their size , thickness and duration			2
taking a closer look at the properties of water droplets and ice crystals within , the researchers found pollution resulted in smaller droplets and ice crystals regardless of location			2
@entity28 talk : pollution increases clouds ' size , thickness and duration , say experts in clean skies ice particles were heavier and fell faster causing the clouds to dissipate			1
but in polluted skies they were smaller and too light to drop leading to the larger clouds			0
dr @entity41 , of @entity42 in @entity43 , said : ‘ this study reconciles what we see in real life to what computer models show us			0
‘ observations consistently show taller and bigger anvil - shaped clouds in storm systems with pollution			1
’ a polluted sky has many more aerosols - natural and manmade particles - making more but smaller cloud droplets			0
lingering : the study found that pollution makes afternoon thunderstorms last further into the night researchers have long believed smaller droplets start a chain reaction that leads to bigger , longer - lasting clouds			1
instead of raining down , the lighter droplets carry their water higher , where they freeze			0
the freezing squeezes out the heat the droplets carry with them and causes the thunder cloud to become draftier			0
dr @entity41 said : ‘ modelling the details of cloud microphysical properties is very computationally intensive so models do n't usually include them			0
’ polluted clouds have an effect on temperatures , with afternoon thunderstorms lasting long into the night rather than dissipating and trapping heat like a blanket			1
in the day the clouds ’ shadows diminish sunlight penetration and so keep the @entity85 cooler			1
accounting for pollution effects on storm clouds could affect the ultimate amount of warming predicted for the earth in the next few decades			2
accurately representing clouds in climate models is key to improving the accuracy of predicted changes to the climate .			0

pollution causes taller and bigger anvil - shaped clouds , say experts
lingering big clouds also warm the @entity85 by trapping heat
