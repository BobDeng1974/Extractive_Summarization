contrite : the @entity1 withdrew ms @entity10 's feature and apologised on its website after a storm of protest it said : ' we have decided to withdraw from publication the @entity10 comment piece ' transsexuals should cut it out '			1
' the piece was an attempt to explore contentious issues within what had become a highly - charged debate			0
' @entity1 is a paper which prides itself on ventilating difficult debates and airing challenging views			0
on this occasion we got it wrong and in light of the hurt and offence caused i apologise and have made the decision to withdraw the piece			0
' but @entity57 @entity56 minister @entity56 has called for @entity58 to be sacked			2

miss @entity10 ranted : ' though i imagine ( @entity17 ) to be something akin to being savaged by a dead sheep , as @entity99 had it of @entity100 , i nevertheless felt indignant that a woman of such style and substance should be driven from her chosen mode of time - wasting by a bunch of d * * * * in chicks ' clothing			1
she added that the reaction of ‘ the very vociferous transsexual lobby and their grim groupies ’ reminded her ‘ of those wretched inner - city kids who shoot another inner - city kid dead in a fast - food shop for not showing them enough “ respect ”			0

she added : ‘ i must say that my only experience of the trans lobby thus far was hearing about the vile way they have persecuted another of my friends , the veteran women ’s rights and anti-domestic violence activist @entity145 – picketing events where she is speaking about such minor issues as the rape of children and the trafficking of women just because she refuses to accept that their relationship with their phantom limb is the most pressing problem that women – real and imagined – are facing right now			0
