by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 wants to make history again			2
she was the first woman to win an @entity4 boxing title in @entity5 two years ago , and now she wants to become the first female @entity7 champion on saturday in @entity8			1
the 5ft 4in flyweight ’s desire remains as strong as ever			0
‘ i want to be the first and make history and bring back gold for @entity14 , ’ she said			1
‘ it ’s a really , really big draw for me			0
i want to get another first under my belt			0
’ women ’s boxing make its @entity7 debut in @entity8 on monday , with @entity20 ’s category the first of three events for female boxers on finals day next saturday			1
sealed with a kiss : @entity1 , pictured here kissing her 2012 @entity26 , is aiming for glory in @entity8 more to come ? @entity20 wants to add @entity7 gold to her memorable success at @entity30 @entity14 ’s @entity31 and @entity32 are also heavily tipped to win gold , but it is the smiling @entity20 who is attracting the most attention			1
the @entity4 champion is the biggest draw in the entire boxing programme , men and women , something that would have been unthinkable two years ago			1
but then @entity20 is now perfectly at home popping into 10 @entity42 ( ‘ it ’s better than it looks ’ ) or visiting @entity43 with the prime minister			1
she went up to her old boxing club in @entity49 recently as she carried the @entity51 ’s relay baton through her home town			2
@entity20 marvelled at how a ‘ small , @entity55 - style club in a basement with one ring and maybe six bags ’ had turned into a buzzing , thriving gym with 10 girls training regularly			1
that ’s the @entity20 effect , in a sporting landscape that has changed dramatically since @entity30			1
the female boxers are not being talked of as novelties in @entity8 , just athletes			1
they may still wear headguards , unlike the men , because they are simply not as powerful and , frankly , there is no will from within the sport to abandon them , but they are still just boxers here to try to win medals for their countries			0
big hitter : @entity20 overcame @entity77 's @entity76 in the final of the women 's flyweight competition in @entity5 honoured : @entity20 poses with fellow athletes @entity81 and @entity83 after receiving an @entity84 ' f * * * * * * @entity85 , ' was sir @entity87 ’s opening gambit , delivered tongue - in - cheek , as he walked into a tent next to a bowling green in the shadow of @entity92 last week			1
it was a particularly odd experience speaking to a knight of the realm as police snipers looked down from the rooftops of the neighbouring high - rise flats … dr @entity99 of the @entity100 has worked with @entity101 since 1997			2
women joined the squad in 2010 and he believes they have helped the amateur sport change ‘ beyond all recognition ’			0
he added : ‘ performance director @entity106 says we do n’t have male and female boxers , we just have boxers			0
that ’s the attitude throughout the squad and they are all treated very much the same			0
‘ they all train in @entity113 four days a week and there are coaching staff , three physios , masseurs , nutritionists , two psychologists , two performance analysts , two strength and conditioning coaches , a physiologist and many more			0
i would n’t dream of giving out nutrition advice , for example — there is an expert for that			0
‘ @entity1 is a remarkable athlete			0
she put in an extraordinary amount of work to get herself fit for the @entity4			2
you do n’t just get given @entity4 gold medals			1
’ but it will not be entirely straightforward for @entity20 , who faces @entity136 police officer @entity135 on monday			1
all smiles : @entity20 wants to make history in @entity8 by becoming the first female @entity7 champion special moment : @entity20 discusses her triumph at the @entity4 with the @entity51 after receiving her @entity84 away from the @entity145 , @entity144 ’s future stars have enjoyed the @entity146			1
@entity147 turned down a place in @entity8 to race in @entity149 , where she won the heptathlon title by setting a world youth best of 6,148 points			1
@entity153 is just 17 and still has two years to improve on that record			0
the 31 - year - old suffered her first defeat in almost two years in the quarter - finals of the @entity158 in june ; a ‘ strange ’ feeling that left her angry after her dream of becoming @entity144 ’s first double @entity162 champion — male or female — was dashed			2
‘ it was n’t too much of a setback , ’ she insists			0
‘ i had won the @entity158 gold already in my career and the @entity169 are my main focus this year			2
‘ it was disappointing but i ca n’t dwell on the past			0
’ the @entity7 field is just 11 strong and athletes will only have to contest a maximum of four bouts , but there are still potential dangers for the @entity179			2
@entity185 ’s @entity180 and @entity182 railway worker @entity181 , who beat five - time world champion @entity183 to reach these games , are lurking in the draw			0
but @entity1 is only interested in finishing first			0
there is history to be made in @entity8 , after all .			2
