they had only one shot at it , with the masked raider wriggling clear of security in the 88th minute and making his way into the penalty area undetected			0
this was the second @entity10 heist in a week , with the @entity12 imposter easily identifiable when he whipped off his head gear in front of @entity17 ’s stunned supporters			2
@entity18 was the diamond when he worked the opening , following the carefully laid out plans of @entity22 and substitute @entity23 to pull off this unlikely job for @entity26			1
the finish called for precision			0
@entity18 arrives late on to convert @entity22 's pass and secure all three points for @entity26 at @entity12 @entity18 celebrates with @entity31 after scoring a late goal which was harsh on @entity17 , but sent @entity26 seven clear @entity34 ’s team are within inches of the silverware — the @entity38 crown — after this dramatic game of smash and grab			1
@entity42 had been on guard throughout , but the crestfallen @entity45 keeper made the mistake that allowed @entity26 to extend their lead at the top of the table again			1
you snooze , you lose			0
it was an important victory for @entity34 , keeping @entity52 at arm ’s length by recording their 22nd victory of the season in the @entity38			1
‘ we have been at the top throughout , ’ he declared			0
@entity60 hugs his goalscoring team - mate @entity18 as @entity62 and @entity63 look on dejected at the final whistle @entity63 lets fly from long range , the best effort for either side in a first half lacking quality in front of goal where they rank among the great teams to win the title , such as the @entity77 vintages ( 1999 and 2009 ) or @entity52 ’s ‘ invincibles ’ ( 2004 ) — is of no concern to the @entity80			1
@entity26 ’s manager has put together a team to win the league , grinding down the opposition until they eventually lift the trophy , probably later this month			2
they are relentless , we know that			0
here at @entity12 they were met with the resistance of their noisy neighbours @entity17 , surviving the screams and shouts from the stands to stretch their lead over @entity52 to seven points			2
@entity95 made a stunning save to deny @entity96 , as @entity26 's @entity98 goalkeeper kept @entity17 's forwards at bay they will meet at the @entity101 on april 26 , but @entity26 are equipped to survive the sternest and stiffest tests that domestic competition can throw at them			1
even @entity104 knows a title - winning team when he sees one			0
@entity26 had only one shot on target , an improbable statistic for a team that can call upon the dancing feet of @entity22 , @entity111 , substitute @entity23 and @entity18			1
@entity62 ( above ) was everywhere for @entity17 , but @entity112 ( below ) failed to have much impact			2

subs not used : @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 booked : @entity137 goal : @entity18 88 referee : @entity145 @entity146 : @entity95 ratings by @entity148 @entity26 were careless in possession , knocked out of their rhythm by the boisterous presence of @entity124 , @entity122 and the bristling figure of @entity62 strung out across the @entity17 midfield			1
this defeat feels tough on them because anyone who can sedate @entity60 and @entity112 over the course of 90 minutes probably deserves a bit more			0
the pair were over-run in that @entity26 midfield			2
rangers have found an outlet in the willing , emerging figure of @entity121 down their right flank			2
they have to use and abuse him to stand a chance of staying up			0
@entity26 's @entity134 wins the ball from @entity17 's in - form winger @entity121 as the league leaders attempted to control the game he looked to be their one chance of making something happen , a shuttlecock on that halfway line as he flitted in and out of @entity26 ’s half			1
@entity134 will be glad to see the back of him			0
so will @entity132 , the @entity26 defender who bravely intercepted @entity121 ’s dangerous first - half crosses from that cultured right boot			1
@entity121 was a menace on that wing			2
he had a massive chance to put @entity45 in front at the start of the second half , denied by the anticipation of @entity26 keeper @entity95 when the @entity98 moved to his left to turn the shot away for a corner			1
@entity62 battles with @entity26 's @entity18 , who was wearing a mask after a collision with @entity190 against @entity191 last week when that failed , @entity45 went old school , lofting balls into the box in the hope that forwards @entity125 or @entity63 would get their head onto one of them			1
even against @entity26 captain @entity133 and the commanding presence of @entity132 , the agricultural approach almost worked			2
@entity133 was hammered by @entity17 fans , choking on the abuse from the stands because of his exchange here with their former centre half @entity207 in october 2011			0
@entity137 , starting in the absence of @entity210 and @entity211 , is tackled by @entity119 at @entity12 @entity133 , whose every touch was booed by the @entity12 crowd , wins the ball ahead of @entity125 to clear the danger @entity26 ’s captain has learned to deal with it , but the trip to @entity12 is possibly as poisonous as it gets for @entity133			1
he can take his medicine			0
@entity45 were shooting from anywhere , with @entity96 ’s looping effort falling neatly into @entity95 ’ arms from long range and later drawing a stunning save to the keeper ’s right with another poke from distance			0
even @entity62 shanked an effort wide of @entity95 ’ goal when he was put clean through after the break			2
they gave this a right , old - fashioned go			0
@entity120 puts in a tough tackle on @entity26 's @entity236 winger @entity111 as @entity17 battled hard and matched @entity26 in the first half @entity12 was a bear pit , with just under 20,000 @entity45 crammed into this stadium to watch them match their west @entity10 rivals for blood and guts			1
under manager @entity243 , they have renewed their faith			0
rangers have given themselves a chance of getting out of the mess at the foot of the table after that handsome 4 - 1 win at @entity251 earlier this month , followed by a 3 - 3 draw with @entity253			0
there is a noticeable shift in mentality , pulling together as they approach the final five games — @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 — of the season			0
@entity26 chairman @entity265 ( left ) and owner @entity266 share a joke as they watch their team in action at @entity12 the @entity270 was celebrating his 700th game as @entity26 owner since taking over the west @entity10 club in 2003 @entity133 has to stretch to stop the ball getting through to @entity125 as the hosts created the better chances in the first half @entity132 stuck tight to @entity96 as the @entity17 front two caused plenty of problems with their direct style of play @entity133 clashed with @entity96 on a number of occasions , in particular when he felt the @entity17 striker had followed through on @entity95 @entity26 are masters at this , calling on the pedigree of @entity22 , in his 100 appearance in the @entity38 , @entity23 and the timing of @entity18 to secure this narrow win			1
it was their first chance , the only time in this game when they properly opened up the central defensive pairing of @entity119 and @entity118			0
the man in the mask was there to finish the job , scoring in the league for the first time since @entity26 won 2 - 0 on the road at @entity191 on december 22			1
‘ it ’s like failing a driving test , ’ admitted @entity17 ’s manager			0
here at @entity12 , @entity18 turned out to be the getaway driver			0
a @entity17 fan shouts abuse at @entity26 's @entity236 midfielder @entity23 as the player prepares to take a corner late on @entity265 and @entity266 watch the action unfold at @entity12 as @entity26 take another step closer to the @entity38 title			1

@entity18 takes *advantage* of @entity42 error to win the game for @entity26 three minutes from time
@entity26 had lacked a threat in the absence of @entity210 and @entity211 , with @entity137 up front
before goal @entity17 came closest to scoring , with @entity95 saving well from @entity63 and @entity121
@entity34 's side are seven points clear at the top of the @entity38 with a game in hand
