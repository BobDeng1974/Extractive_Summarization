@entity0 ended their 20 - game losing run in the @entity3 with an enthralling 29 - 24 victory over @entity5 at @entity6			1
both sides scored three tries each and had their chances to score a four - try bonus win in an end - to - end second half but , after @entity13 's 69th - minute score , the @entity0 had the edge			1
fittingly , @entity0 ' man of the match @entity15 ended 10 minutes of almost unbearable tension for the home crowd - after @entity18 crossed over for a try - when he booted the ball into the stand from a scrum right on the @entity0 line to end that losing run			1
@entity0 celebrate emphatically at the final whistle with victory over @entity5 @entity0 players celebrate with the @entity6 faithful in the @entity28 on sunday it was a cracking game from the start with the @entity0 making a mess of the kick - off as the ball rebounded back on the @entity5 side and eventually a penalty into the corner saw @entity37 driven over from the line - out			1
it was @entity0 who reacted strongest and they launched several penetrating attacks with @entity15 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 feeding off @entity46 's darting runs			2
two penalties resulted from the boot of @entity49 in the 10th and 12th minutes			0
but @entity46 then paid the price for trying to run the ball out of defence as he threw a wild pass which saw flanker @entity54 snap it up and break through for @entity5 's second try			0
almost immediately @entity56 released @entity15 down the right and big number eight slipped the ball to @entity60 , the winger scoring in the corner to make it 11 - 10 and then soon afterwards @entity56 landed a 50 - metre penalty to increase the score to 14 - 10			2
@entity0 back - rower @entity15 put in a man of the match performance against the @entity5 @entity18 ( right ) celebrates scoring a try with @entity44 during the @entity3 match it was end - to - end stuff and when @entity0 made a mess of a line - out drive and turned the ball over , @entity5 should have scored when they broke away			1
but @entity74 kicked ahead when keeping the ball in hand would have really stretched the @entity0 , who were vastly relieved to see the ball run into touch			0
the centre made up for his mistake when he scrambled over in the corner right on the stroke of half - time after some heavy - duty work by the @entity86 forwards and @entity88 's conversion hit the bar to send @entity5 take a narrow 15 - 14 lead into the break			0
@entity60 's typically aggressive run at the start of the second half led to a penalty which @entity49 banged into the @entity5 22 where the @entity5 infringed at the line - out maul and @entity49 slotted the ball home			2
@entity88 ( left ) of @entity5 is tackled by @entity99 of @entity0 but then three penalties from @entity88 in the space of 13 minutes swung then game in @entity5 's favour			2
a careless offside from @entity46 's box kick allowed @entity88 to kick in the 52nd minute and then the @entity5 fly half kicked another five minutes later for handling in the ruck , followed by a third for a scrummage offence in the 65th			0
but then @entity0 scored twice in three minutes to stand the game on its head			0
@entity99 and @entity112 combined to send in @entity113 under the posts before @entity49 converted to level the scores at 24 - 24			0
@entity0 swept back through @entity117 ' superb offload to tait down the left and @entity13 scored in the corner to make it 29 - 24 leaving @entity0 in the driving seat as the clock counted down .			1

the @entity0 edged out the @entity5 at @entity6
@entity0 back - rower @entity15 was in *impressive* form for the home side
both sides scored three tries each and had their chances to score a four - try bonus
