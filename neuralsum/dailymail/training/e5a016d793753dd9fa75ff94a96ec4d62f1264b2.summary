by @entity1 reporter published : 01:02 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 27 july 2013 when a @entity4 student sent a request to a record label asking that the 1990s grunge - rock band @entity7 record a video message for the college 's homecoming week , the student may have wanted to consult with @entity11 before making the request			1
had the student - who only is identified as the school 's mascot - done so , it would have become very clear that the request was n't going to happen			2
the reason : the band split up nearly 20 years ago after its famous front - man , @entity19 , committed suicide in 1994			1
lets go hokies ! ' the student promises that if the band fulfills the request , the homecoming committee will ' include any links to downloads , @entity46 pages , @entity48 pages , and / or @entity49 ' for the band			2
the student goes on to add that if @entity7 would make the video , the band would be ' among artists that include @entity54 , @entity55 , the @entity56 , slightly stoopid and three famous @entity57			0
' oops : a @entity4 student sent this embarrassingly outdated request to a record label presumably , those three unnamed @entity57 players currently are living			2
despite being apparently oblivious to the fact that one of the most famous rock stars of the last 25 years has been dead for nearly 20 of them , the student does n't appear to realize the gender of the three members of the band			0
' as @entity4 loves @entity7 , we 'd love to have her in our video , ' the student writes			0
@entity7 , of course , was comprised of three men			0
' @entity7 ' : @entity74 @entity73 took the place of @entity19 in cheering on the @entity4 ' hoagies ' confused by the embarrassingly outdated request , employees at @entity26 decided to have a little fun			1
using @entity73 , who played in the @entity7 contemporary band @entity81 , as a stand - in for @entity19 , they recorded a message for the school - but @entity84 does n't cheer for the @entity85 , he cheers for a sandwich			1
' @entity88 , ' he and other employees yell at the end of the video .			0

@entity19 committed suicide in 1994
the record company recorded a spoof video of the student 's request , in which they cheer for the ' hoagies '
