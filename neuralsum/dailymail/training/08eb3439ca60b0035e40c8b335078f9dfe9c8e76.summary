by @entity0 published : 23:50 est , 1 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:51 est , 2 december 2013 it ’s the most wonderful time of the year – the time when the @entity4 release their annual @entity6 card			0
and of course , @entity7 had her heart set on being the centre of attention for the elaborate photo shoot			2
the reality star showcased the figure that made her famous in a show - stopping @entity16 dress while smouldering for the camera for the 2013 card , which was unveiled on sunday			0
the floor - length halter - neck gown hugged @entity7 ’s curves in all the right places and had sequined sleeves and a split all the way up one side			0
@entity7 wore her blonde hair big and bouncy for the photo , which was shot by @entity23 , and topped off her look with purple heels			1
@entity23 had asked her to spray her hair black , and when @entity7 declined he still was n't happy after she had her locks styled , calling the look ' so normal ' and claiming , ' i want a f * * * ing sex machine			1
show - stopping : @entity7 is the centre of attention in the image , wearing a black gown with a keyhole cut - out to display her ample cleavage and a split all the way up one side the big reveal : the family revealed this year 's card on keeping up with the @entity4 : a very merry @entity6 special when @entity7 returned after having her tresses backcombed to the extreme , @entity61 told her : ' your hair is bigger than your ass			1
' the card is the family ’s most elaborate to date , and set in a post-apocalyptic , chaotic casino with mannequin parts all over the place , and a sea of tabloid magazines with various members of the clan on the cover strewn across the floor			0
@entity78 and @entity79 were wearing headpieces and similar black dresses with side - splits , but while 16 - year - old @entity79 ’s had long and billowing sleeves , 18 - year - old @entity78 ’s was sleeveless and she paired it with opera gloves			0
@entity86 and @entity87 were clad in black cocktail dresses , and while @entity87 held @entity90 in her arms , @entity89 lounged on a chair beside @entity86 , whose dress ripped during the shoot			1
pulling out all the stops : @entity61 is seen in a glass case , while @entity97 sat proudly atop a cashier and @entity87 and @entity99 lounged in the background with @entity87 's children @entity89 and @entity90 giving @entity7 a run for her money was her mother @entity97 , who hitched up her strapless dress and sat regally and aptly on a cashier booth , wearing a @entity108 inspired headdress			1
meanwhile @entity61 was sporting long hair and a tuxedo while inside a case , forlornly pressed up against the glass			2
the family are surrounded by blown up photos of @entity7 in her younger years , while tv screens behind @entity97 display further images of the famous family			1
noticeably absent from the holiday card is @entity119 , with the sock entrepreneur declining to participate after revealing he was n't feeling up to it			2
it was previously revealed that the sisters ’ significant others , @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127 , as well as @entity7 ’s baby daughter @entity129 , would not be taking part in the festivities			1
sister act : @entity78 ( r ) and @entity133 wore similar black dresses while stood amongst various tabloid magazines with members of the famous family on the cover hat 's nice : @entity79 was clearly excited about her look for the card and on sunday shared a photo on @entity144 in which she can be seen showing off her silver headdress the decision to feature solely the women in the family , aside from @entity61 and @entity89 , was that of @entity23 ’s , and the famed photographer was not keen on the idea of @entity87 ’s children being involved either			1
but the 34 - year - old was n’t having it and said firmly during the @entity4 : a very merry @entity6 special : ‘ i really think my kids should be part of it			0
i know he is an artist but it ’s still our family @entity6 card			0
they will be in it			0
’ @entity61 also was resolved that he would be featuring , and told @entity78 : ‘ it ’s not the girls ’ @entity6 card , it ’s our family @entity6 card			2
we ’ve done it for 23 years and they want to change it ? it ’s your mom ’s and my @entity6 card			0
’ the card is certainly a far stretch from the clan ’s 2012 @entity6 card , which featured the entire family , complete with children , partners and pets , celebrating together while dressed in all - white			0
what a difference a year makes : the family 's holiday card for 2012 was a lot more low - key , and showed all of the clan celebrating while dressed in white			1
