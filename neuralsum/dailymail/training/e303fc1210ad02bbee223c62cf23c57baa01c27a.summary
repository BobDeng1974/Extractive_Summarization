this week , a tournament here on one of his favourite courses ; next week , a @entity6 courtroom for an explosive legal battle			1
for the next four days , @entity8 is the star attraction at the @entity10			1
next tuesday he is suing his former management company and being countersued , with millions of euros at stake			1
for months @entity8 has insisted he has had no problem separating these two worlds : that what might happen in court has been no distraction			1
@entity8 plays a shot during the @entity21 event ahead of the @entity10 @entity22 admits his legal battle with former management group has been a ' nasty process ' the @entity26 insists that performing in @entity27 is more important to him than his dispute his stunning sequence of results rather bears that out but with the court case now so close , he admits it is becoming harder not to let the mind wander			1
‘ it is not really something you want hanging over your head , ’ said the world no 1			2
‘ it is a shame it has gone this far but it ’s hard when two sides see things completely differently			2
‘ the only way seems to be to get a judge to sort it out and tell us what to do			2
hopefully it will not take too long and that it will be all over and done with and we can all move on			2
‘ it has been a very tedious and nasty process at times			2
i ’m looking forward to heading to the @entity55 with it off my mind and not having to deal with it or think about it			0
’ after @entity27 , @entity8 will head to the @entity60 with the chance of completing a career @entity63 at the masters can he go four days here without thinking about it ? it should help that this is a place filled with happy memories			1
‘ i first played in this event as an amateur 10 years ago , which is hard to imagine , ’ he said			0
‘ then i had my first pro victory here , so i guess this was the place where it all began			0
i think when you get your first win you move to a different level and that victory proved the basis for what i have gone on to achieve in the last six years			0
‘ so let ’s see what we can do this week			0
it would certainly be nice to return to the victory trail			0
it does feel like a long time since my last win			0
@entity8 lines up with a collection of @entity92 's finest golfers ahead of the tournament ‘ but i am comfortable on this course and so hopefully i can head off to @entity60 with a win under my belt			1
’ @entity8 will play three events in the @entity55 in the build - up to the masters , when he will be trying to win a third major in a row and become just the sixth golfer to complete the career @entity63			1
‘ this feels like the week when the golf season has well and truly begun , ’ he said			0
‘ in @entity112 you ’ve got @entity113 playing and @entity114 , while here we ’ve got a great field with @entity117 ( @entity118 ) , @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , @entity106 ( @entity107 ) and @entity108 and it wo n’t be long before the @entity64 rolls along			1
’ he ’s right about that			0
but it might feel like a long time next week			0
@entity8 and @entity121 team - mate @entity107 look lost in the sand during the @entity124 event			1
