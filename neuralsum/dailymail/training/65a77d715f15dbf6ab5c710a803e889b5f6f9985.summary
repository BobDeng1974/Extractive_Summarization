in what is described as the ' @entity8 ' , civilisation started to become more spiritual , creating what some historians believe are the roots of today 's major religions			0
but instead of misfortune or poverty , researchers in @entity14 claim to have evidence to link the emergence of world religions with rising standards of living			1

they found that affluence caused a sharp transition toward moralising religions when individuals were provided with more food			1

' beyond very different doctrines , they probably all tap into the same reward systems in the human brain			0
' the finding goes against recent reports in the @entity46 that aimed to find out where people find meaning , and how they found it			0
it discovered that some of the world 's poorest countries , such as @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56 , ranked highest for meaning			0
in the new study , published in the journal @entity61 , the researchers tested various theories to explain the history in a different way , by combining statistical modelling with psychological theories			2

pictured is a relief at the ruins of @entity77 , @entity2 they found that affluence - which they refer to as ' energy capture ' - best explains what is known of the religious history , rather than political complexity , or population size			1
their energy capture model shows a sharp transition toward moralising religions when individuals were provided with significantly more food			2
' humans living in tribal societies or even archaic empires often experience famine and diseases , and they live in very rudimentary houses			0
' by contrast , the high increase in population and urbanisation rate in the @entity8 suggests that , for certain people , things started to get much better			0
' the researchers said that this transition is consistent with a shift from ' fast ' life strategies - focused on the immediate problems of the day - to those focused on long - term investments			1
they added that it will now be interesting to test whether other familiar characteristics of modern human society - such as high parental investment and long - term monogamy - might stem from the same historical change			1
a recent study has found ' no significant difference ' in the number or quality of moral and immoral deeds made by religious and non-religious participants			1
the researchers found only one difference - religious people responded with more pride and gratitude for their moral deeds , and more guilt , embarrassment and disgust for immoral ones			1
researchers say the find means religious and non-religious people have more in common than generally thought when it comes to moral experiences in everyday life			1
' to our knowledge , it 's the first study that directly assesses how morality plays out in people 's everyday lived experience , ' says @entity146 , a @entity147 psychologist			0
who co-authored the study , which was published in the journal @entity151			0
to learn how people experience morality and immorality in everyday life , the researchers surveyed more than 1,200 adults , aged 18 to 68 , via smartphone			2
for three days , the demographically diverse group of @entity160 and @entity161 citizens received five signals daily , prompting them to deliver short answers to a questionnaire about any moral or immoral act they had committed , received , witnessed or heard about within the last hour			0
the study found that religious and nonreligious people differed in only one way : how moral and immoral deeds made them feel .			1

study *carried* out by researchers at the @entity34 in @entity14
they found a transition toward religion when individuals felt more secure
study claims security meant they moved away from ' fast life ' strategies
their focus shifted from thinking about immediate problems to considering more long - term investments
study contradicts research that claims poorer countries are more religious
