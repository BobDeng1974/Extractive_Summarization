by @entity1 reporter published : 18:35 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 18:36 est , 9 november 2013 it 's the bane of drivers on country roads that can add long delays to your journey – but now ministers have pledged to speed up slow - moving tractors			0
the @entity10 has put forward a proposal to raise the tractor speed limit to 25mph in a bid to make farmers and rural transport more efficient , and give a multi-million - pound boost to the economy			1
ending the current 20mph limit would bring @entity19 into line with other countries in the @entity22 , as well as shaving time off those frustrating delays for drivers who find themselves stuck in a slow - moving convoy of traffic behind a tractor			1
tailback : the move would see farmer 's rural transport become more efficient , according to ministers in a consultation document released last week , the department argues that the current 20mph speed limit for tractors does ‘ not reflect the capabilities of modern farm machinery , forcing farmers to drive unnecessarily slowly on public roads ’			2
the productivity boost to farmers from increasing the speed limit by 5mph has been calculated to save farmers £ 89.72 million a year – or more than £ 1.13 billion over ten years			0
the figures were calculated on the basis of shorter journey times , greater fuel economy and improved productivity			0
transport minister @entity50 announced a 90 - day public consultation into the changes			1
backing the changes to help the economy , he said : ‘ it would also mean that motorists who get frustrated behind a tractor would not be travelling quite as slowly			0
’ up to speed : the move would see @entity19 farmers brought in line with their @entity63 colleagues who are already able to drive at 25mph			2

@entity10 wants to raise limit from 20mph to 25mph
it would bring the tractor speed - limit in line with @entity63 countries
90 day public consultation has been announced ahead of any change
