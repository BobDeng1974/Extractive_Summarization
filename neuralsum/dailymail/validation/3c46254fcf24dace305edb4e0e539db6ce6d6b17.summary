a @entity1 church is drawing criticism after it posted a message on its marquee which appeared to link @entity5 and the @entity7 's quest to secure equal rights			1
the @entity9 posted the controversial message , but took it down after experiencing some backlash			1
before it was removed , the marquee read : ' remember @entity5 was the first to demand equal rights			2
many people felt the sign was meant to offend individuals who identify as gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender , but the @entity36 's pastor said that was not the case			1
pastor @entity19 said : ' our sign referencing @entity5 demanding his equal rights to ascend into the heavens and be @entity43 was simply all about that individual			2
' it was not a statement against any one group in particular , you know what about the rights of the unborn babies , the rights of children , the rights of everyone ? ' some did not buy @entity19 's explanation			0
@entity55 told @entity56 : ' it 's clearly a sign that was meant to offend a particular community - the lgbt community			1
' because of ( the church 's ) lack of foresight , they ended up offending everybody who had ever fought for equality or civil rights in general			0
' the sign was changed to read : ' glad you reading , did not intend to offend , we all need @entity72			1
' @entity19 said : ' we are a diversity congregation of people			0
' we 've reached people that know us and know our stand in this community know what we 've done			0
' my heart breaks in the dividedness of our country			0
' the @entity9 ' not only supports soul - winning at home , but also supports evangelism and church - planting in @entity86 and around the world ' , according to its website			2
the church has missions in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			0
it will have another message posted later this week , according to the pastor .			1
