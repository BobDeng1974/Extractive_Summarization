by @entity0 a serial burglar killed a ' defenceless ' elderly widow - just 12 days after a court let him back out on the streets			1
@entity5 , 33 , who was on bail following a stint in prison for burglary , barged into the home of @entity11 , 87 , on @entity12 after pretending he was looking for a rabbit in her garden			1
but the stealing spree was interrupted when mrs @entity11 ’s son @entity17 turned up with her daily newspaper at her home in @entity20			2
shameless : drug addict @entity5 , 33 , burgled widow @entity11 , 87 , less than a fortnight after a court freed him on bail as he tried to flee @entity5 pushed mrs @entity11 over with such force that she hit her head on the wall causing an indentation in the plaster			1
brave mr @entity30 tried to stop @entity5 from escaping on a bicycle by shoving a stick in the wheel spokes - but he managed to get away – and went on to rob £ 40 from a baby girl			1
mrs @entity11 was taken to hospital but discharged the same day because she did n’t display any symptoms of injury			2
@entity38 heard how @entity5 , who was drunk and high on cocaine , fled to the flat of an acquaintance and begged for money			2
when he was refused , @entity5 barged in and stole £ 40 from a baby girl ’s money box , a watch , and even more cash from a wallet			1
later that day police raided @entity5 ’s home in @entity20 where they found him hiding under the bed and wearing the stolen watch			1
the next day mrs @entity11 , whose husband died in 1991 , was found slumped on the kitchen floor by her son – having apparently lain there all night			1

in a statement mrs @entity11 ’s family said : ‘ the crime committed by @entity5 caused the death of a gentle old lady and nothing can bring her back , but we hope today ’s proceedings can draw a line and our family can start to look ahead to the future and find some peace			2
’ ' defenceless ' : widow @entity11 , 87 , was killed in her own home by drug addict @entity5 , 33 , after he forced his way in looking for things to steal the court heard how @entity5 , who had been jailed previously for burglary , was granted bail for an undisclosed offence - just 15 days before the twin raids – when he began cruising the streets in a drink and drug fuelled haze looking for homes to loot			1
he claimed his crimes were driven by his ‘ long term deep addiction to drugs and alcohol ’ and blamed his troubles on a ‘ difficult upbringing ’			0
passing sentence , judge @entity97 said : ‘ mrs @entity11 ’s family had hoped her death when it came would be peaceful , not the brutal , violent ugly nightmare it turned out to be			0
if you had not chosen to burgle her home you would not have been there			0
if you had not been there and tried to escape she would not have sustained a serious injury to her head which proved to be fatal			0
’ after the case @entity108 , @entity110 ’s @entity109 , said : ‘ @entity5 knew his victim was an elderly , defenceless woman when she answered the door to him			0
‘ he showed no regard for her when he entered her property and has subsequently shown no remorse			0
‘ as a result of his actions , an otherwise fit and healthy lady has had her life cut short and a family has lost a loved one in tragic circumstances			0
throughout the ordeal , subsequent criminal investigation and court processes , @entity11 ’s family have shown great dignity and composure			0
