by @entity1 reporter published : 15:09 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 15:09 est , 29 march 2013 an @entity3 judge on friday refused to grant a divorce for a transgender @entity3 man who gave birth to three children after beginning to change his sex from female			1
@entity11 judge @entity10 ruled that @entity3 's ban on same - sex marriages prevents @entity15 's 9 - year union from being recognized as valid			1
@entity15 was born a woman and later underwent a double - mastectomy , and began testosterone hormone therapy and psychological treatment to become a man , but he retained female reproductive organs and gave birth to three children			1
he said the @entity42 never provided records to fully explain what @entity15 actually had done and not done to become a man			2
' the decision here is not based on the conclusion that this case involves a same - sex marriage merely because one of the parties is a transsexual male , but instead , the decision is compelled by the fact that the parties failed to prove that ( @entity15 ) was a transsexual male when they were issued their marriage license , ' he wrote in friday 's ruling			1
a spokesman for @entity15 , @entity59 , said the judge 's comments came as a shock and that @entity15 plans to appeal the ruling			2
he said @entity15 legally was married as a man and never was required to disclose that he retained female reproductive organs when applying for and being granted a new birth certificate in @entity41 as a man			1
he said @entity15 halted testosterone treatments so that he could give birth to his children			2
' it 's unfortunate that the judge out here does n't recognize marriage in another state , ' @entity59 said			2
more babies : ' hypothetically we have talked about starting a family together and we would have to check out our fertility options ' @entity15 is eager to end his marriage , but the couple 's divorce plans stalled last summer when @entity10 said he was unable to find legal authority defining a man as someone who can give birth			1
@entity10 's ruling did n't address whether @entity3 law allows a person who was born female to marry another female after undergoing a sex change operation			1
a separate ruling issued friday by @entity10 sets guidelines on how the @entity42 will co-parent their three children and grants them joint authority in making legal decisions			0
@entity15 is required to pay nearly $ 240 a month to @entity40 for child support , but she wo n't get alimony because the marriage was declared invalid			2
@entity40 's attorney , @entity101 , praised @entity10 for the thoroughness of the decision on the marriage , although it was n't the one she had hoped for			0
' he still sees a same - sex marriage , but he gave us all the rulings that we 're asking for as far as the children , ' @entity101 said			0
@entity15 shows off his pregnant stomach before becoming the first man to give birth the @entity113 , which is n't involved in the @entity15 divorce case , has said courts have declared marriages involving a transgender person invalid in a handful of cases across the country , but that those cases had different factual and legal issues than those in the @entity15 case			1
@entity15 , known as ' the @entity29 , ' was born @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity41			0
he began testosterone treatments in 1997 and underwent double mastectomy and chest reconstruction surgery in 2002			0
he changed his @entity41 driver 's license to say he was a man and had a @entity41 court approve his name change to @entity15			0
@entity10 's ruling noted that @entity15 halted the testosterone treatments and that he did n't provide documentation for any additional non-surgical efforts			0
new start : @entity15 and his new love amber spoke to @entity140 last month about their options for having a child together @entity15 married his partner @entity28 in early 2003 in @entity145 and became pregnant because @entity28 was unable to have children			1
@entity15 conceived with donated sperm and gave birth to children who are now 4 , 3 and 2 years old			1
the couple eventually moved to @entity3			0
@entity15 has garnered a range of media attention , making the rounds on talk shows such as @entity155 and @entity156 and winning a spot on @entity159 ' list of ' @entity160 ' in 2008 , alongside president @entity161 , conservative commentator @entity162 and swimmer @entity163			0
he also published a book , ' @entity165 : the @entity168 's @entity167 , ' the cover displaying an image of a shirtless @entity15 sporting facial hair and holding a hand over his bare pregnant belly .			0

@entity15 and ex-wife @entity28 are seeking a divorce to finalize their split and legally put their *affairs* in order
the couple have three children , who @entity15 gave birth to as he was born a woman
the judge in their case has *questioned* if their marriage was ever legal under @entity3 law because @entity15 is transgender
the judge decided he has no jurisdiction to grant divorce because there was n't enough evidence that he was a man when he married his wife
