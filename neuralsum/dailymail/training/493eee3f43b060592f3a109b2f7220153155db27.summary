by @entity0 published : 20:31 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 21:11 est , 13 july 2012 the buzz around @entity2 becoming @entity4 ’s vice-presidential running mate has increased significantly after internet pioneer @entity5 reported that she is ‘ near the top ’ of his shortlist			1
mr @entity4 could name his running mate as early as next week , significantly before the traditional time of just before the party convention in late august			1
he is widely expected to name a safe , unexciting figure in order to keep the focus of the election on president @entity17 ’s record			2
the next vice president ? @entity2 allegedly has a good chance of being @entity4 's running mate ms @entity2 , president @entity21 ’s national security adviser for four years and then his secretary of state , would be a stunning choice and fly in the face of almost everything mr @entity4 himself and his advisers have indicated they want in a running mate			1
mr @entity5 used his @entity31 website to tease readers with an ‘ exclusive ’ story : ‘ a surprise name is now near the top of the list : former secretary of state @entity2 ! ’ he added : ‘ it was @entity2 who received two standing ovations at @entity4 's @entity40 retreat a few weeks ago , and everyone left with her name on their lips			1
’ the @entity46 professor has never run for office or faced anything like the intense personal scrutiny vice-presidential candidates have to go through			0
she has no domestic policy experience and has said he favours abortion rights – a position that would make her anathema to conservatives and some independent voters			0
she is very closely associated with mr @entity21 and the unpopular @entity58 war and has no executive experience			0
after the 2008 election , she hinted strongly that she voted for mr @entity17 rather than senator @entity61 , the @entity62 nominee			0
announcement : a @entity4 spokesman has revealed that the running mate will be chosen soon aged 57 , ms @entity2 has never married and is seen as something of an introvert			1
she has repeatedly made clear over the years that she does not believe she is cut out for the rigours of a political campaign			2
the floating of her name could well be a ploy to shift the subject of political conversation away from mr @entity4 ’s record at @entity77 , which is currently taking a hammering , and to appeal to women voters , who tend to lean @entity80			1
as a black woman , she would also have some appeal to minority voters and independents			0
presidential candidates often indicate they are considering unusual choices and almost always indicate that a woman or a minority is under consideration , in large part to placate different party and voting constituencies			0
but mr @entity4 has strongly indicated he will go for a middle - aged white man with executive experience or a @entity96 track record that goes beyond foreign policy			1
his advisers are determined to avoid repeating what they see as the mistake mr @entity61 made in 2008 when he gambled on an inexperienced female – governor @entity102 of @entity103 – as his running mate			0
ms @entity102 ’s inability to answer basic political questions in high - pressure interviews and the drip , drip of revelations from @entity103 of events from her past that had escaped the notice of mr @entity61 ’s vetters , who had only given her cursory consideration , bedevilled and divided his campaign			0
close : ms @entity2 was a long - standing ally of @entity21 as @entity117 and secretary of state senator @entity119 of @entity120 and @entity121 , former governor of @entity122 , are considered the favourites			1
also very much in the running are representative @entity125 of @entity126 and governor @entity127 of @entity128 , while governor @entity129 of @entity130 and senator @entity131 of @entity132 are much more likely picks than ms @entity2			1
senator @entity134 of @entity135 and governor @entity136 of @entity137 probably have a stronger chance than ms @entity2			2
senator @entity139 of @entity140 and governor @entity141 of @entity142 are also frequently mentioned			0
senior @entity4 foreign policy advisers like @entity144 , @entity21 ’s hardline ambassador to the @entity145 , are highly sceptical about ms @entity2 ’s abilities			1
the memoirs of vice president @entity148 , who holds a fundraiser in @entity150 for @entity4 this week , and @entity151 , depict her unfavourably			2
ms @entity2 spoke to @entity4 donors at the @entity40 retreat last month and was well received			1
she later told @entity154 : ‘ i talked about the need for @entity157 leadership ; i talked about the importance of the @entity157 to a more peaceful world , a world that has been quite turbulent in recent years and needs a strong @entity157 anchor			0
‘ but i also talked about the essence of @entity157 , and perhaps that 's what people resonated with			2
’ in the same interview she dampened speculation that she might be mr @entity4 's running mate : ‘ i did n't run for student council president			1
i do n't see myself in any way in elective office			0
’ she added : ‘ i 'm saying there is no way i will do this , because it 's really not me , i know my strengths			2
governor @entity4 needs to find someone who wants to run with him			2
there are many people who will do it very , very well , and i 'll support the ticket			0
’ the news came as mr @entity17 apologised for not inspiring the public enough as president , telling @entity182 he regretted ' thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right			0
