zero - hours worker ? university @entity1 enjoys a cigar @entity5 's efforts to fight off accusations of hypocrisy on zero - hours contracts were in chaos last night			1
party chiefs had scrambled to shore up support for @entity12 after it emerged that dozens of @entity5 councils and mps employ staff on the controversial contracts , which he has pledged to ban			1
in a further blow , @entity18 ’s expenses watchdog rejected claims by @entity14 that they employ staff on zero hours only because they are forced to by the @entity22 system			0
and @entity5 ’s biggest donor unite also lost a humiliating tribunal ruling over an employee who claims he was sacked for complaining about being employed on a zero - hours basis			0
on wednesday , mr @entity12 vowed to end the ‘ epidemic ’ of zero - hours contracts – and blasted the @entity28 for failing to protect ordinary workers			1
but he was accused of ‘ total hypocrisy ’ on the issue after it emerged 68 of his mps – including shadow chancellor @entity34 – had employed staff on that basis in the past two years			1
labour councils , including mr @entity12 ’s own authority in @entity39 , have also issued 22,000 of the contracts			1
as the revelations emerged , party chiefs engineered a letter , signed by 100 workers and employers from ‘ all walks of life ’ , that was also designed as a riposte to a letter signed by dozens of business leaders who backed the @entity28 this week			1
but the move backfired spectacularly last night after it emerged the signatories included a benefit fraudster , a boss who has used zero - hours workers , affluent students and a string of union and party activists			1
they include : @entity63 one of the signatories identified herself as someone who had ‘ worked on [ a ] zero - hours contract ’ , but @entity5 removed her name yesterday after it was revealed she had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012			1
according to tax officials she lived with her ‘ husband ’ , who was the holder of a @entity74 passport , ‘ briefly or not at all ’			2
she was not entitled to benefits because she was subject to ‘ immigration control ’ , but she submitted a tax credits application and a child benefit claim for three children , two of whom did not live with her			2
the court heard that she moved in with a new partner but claimed £ 27,888 in tax credits in two and a half years as a single person			0
boss : fashion designer @entity95 , whose firm employed intern on zero - hours contracts , and @entity101 fan @entity99 , from @entity102 , south @entity103 , who had treated himself to some perfume she was caught after she applied for leave to remain in @entity74 on the basis of her ‘ marriage ’			1
officers found she had been fraudulently claiming benefits and had allowed others to use her name and national insurance number to work illegally in the @entity74			0
in july 2012 she was given a two - year suspended jail sentence and 150 - hour community work order after she pleaded guilty to immigration and fraud charges along with her ‘ husband ’ who had been working at @entity119 as a security officer			1
a @entity5 spokesman said last night : ‘ more than 6,000 people have now signed our letter from all walks of life across the country			1
‘ of course we were unaware of the background of this person			0
the fact still remains that the epidemic of zero - hours contracts are a symbol of the failure of this government ’s economic plan			2
’ cigar - smoking students other signatories included 21 - year - old @entity140 students @entity1 and @entity141			1
facebook pages of the pair – who said they were working zero - hours contracts – included photographs of them smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie			1

his mother @entity160 , 55 , yesterday said he was ‘ just a kid ’ who ‘ knows nothing about politics ’ but had signed the letter after he was asked to by a fellow university student ‘ he vaguely knows ’			1
she told the @entity167 : ‘ all he did was sign a petition that somebody called @entity171 asked everybody to sign			0

it ’s the first time he ’s been interested in an election			0
’ she declined to discuss what work he was doing on a zero - hours contract			2
mr @entity141 , who is in his final year studying economics , is registered to vote at his mother 's house , in an affluent area of @entity183			1
mr @entity1 was also photographed at a party in front of a sign that said ‘ @entity187 ’ , but mrs @entity188 said it was just a ‘ joke ’ sign that was a reference to the @entity191 television programme @entity192			1
she said : ‘ @entity1 has never done drugs in his life			1
it ’s a joke about @entity192			0
that ’s what people of that age do			0
’ mr @entity141 did not respond to a request to comment			1
the zero - hours boss fashion designer @entity95 went into meltdown on live television after it was pointed out that his own firm took on interns on a zero - hours basis			2
mr @entity95 , co-founder of the fashion label @entity211 , was one of the few business figures willing to put their name to @entity5 ’s letter			1
he said he had agreed to sign up ‘ because i want to see a party that starts to commit to reducing the inequality gap ’			2
but he became angry when @entity218 reporter @entity217 pointed out that his own firm had advertised for staff on a zero - hours basis			0
mr @entity95 said the policy had now changed , adding : ‘ it is in the past – we have changed			1
are we not allowed to change ? we realised it was wrong and we changed two years ago			0
’ he said there was a big difference between using unpaid interns and employing someone on zero - hours			2
yesterday , the firm said it still takes on unpaid interns on a short - term basis , although those staying longer are offered payment			0
