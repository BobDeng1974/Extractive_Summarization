in july @entity0 will take a portrait of @entity2 from a satellite probe orbiting @entity4 - and is hoping people will wave at the night sky at just the right time			1
@entity0 's @entity9 probe has been in orbit around @entity4 since october 1997 and has previously managed to capture only a handful of blurred images of @entity2 as it travels around the ringed planet			1
yet due to a rare solar eclipse scheduled to take place next month , the probe 's cameras will be able to take a clear image of our planet without the sunlight causing damage to its sensitive equipment			1
@entity0 's @entity9 probe has been orbiting @entity4 for almost nine years			1
it has previously taken photos of @entity2 , pictured in the top left - hand corner , but @entity0 hopes a solar eclipse scheduled for july will mean the probe can take the clearest shot of the planet to date the @entity9 spacecraft was launched in october 1997			1
it was supposed to last four years but is still fully - functioning and orbiting the ringed planet			0
when @entity9 was launched it orbited several planets , including @entity36 , @entity2 and @entity37 before getting a speed boost from the gravity of each planet that propelled it towards @entity4			1
it went by @entity36 in april 1998 and june 1999 , @entity2 in august 1999 and @entity37 in december 2000			0
it regularly passes by the moons of @entity4 collecting new data and sending these discoveries back on @entity2			2
@entity9 weighs nearly 12,600 pounds and has radioisotope thermoelectric generators ( nuclear power ) on board			0
it will also be the first time @entity0 is telling people exactly when the photo will be taken in the hope they will want to be a part of the event			0
@entity9 imaging team leader @entity57 of the @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 said : ' my sincere wish is that people the world over stop what they 're doing at the time the @entity2 picture is taken to revel in the sheer wonder of simply being alive on a pale blue dot of a planet			2
' and to appreciate the ever - widening perspective of ourselves and our world that we have gained from our interplanetary explorations			0
' @entity0 has said the photo will be taken between 21.27pm and 21.42pm gmt ( 5:27pm and 5:42 p.m. edt ) on 19 july			0
however , anyone who takes part should n't get their hopes up about being seen from space			0
@entity2 is 898 million miles away from @entity4 and will appear as a tiny bright dot next to @entity4 and its rings			2
@entity81 and part of the @entity83 will be pointing towards @entity4 at the time the picture is taken			0
an artist 's impression of what @entity9 looks like as it orbits @entity4			2
when @entity9 was launched in 1997 it orbited several planets , including @entity36 , @entity2 and @entity37 before getting a speed boost from the gravity of each planet that propelled it towards @entity4 this image , snapped in 1990 , was the first ever photograph showing of our solar system			1
it was taken by @entity0 's @entity101 ship and @entity2 can be seen as the small dot , highlighted by the arrow @entity104 , @entity9 project scientist at @entity0 ’s @entity105 in @entity106 said : ' while @entity2 will be only about a pixel in size from @entity9 ’s vantage point 898 million miles away , the @entity9 team is looking forward to giving the world a chance to see what their home looks like from @entity4			1
' with this advance notice , we hope you 'll join us in waving at @entity4 from @entity2 , so we can commemorate this special opportunity			0
' the @entity9 team have chosen the 19 july because it will be able to take advantage of a rare total eclipse of the sun from @entity4			1
another artist 's impression shows @entity2 's proximity to @entity4			2
@entity2 is around 898 million miles away from the ringed planet and will appear as a single pixel in the image @entity0 plans to take in july the spacecraft 's sensitive cameras can then turn toward @entity2 without suffering any damage from the sun 's rays			1
' ever since we caught sight of the @entity2 among the @entity137 in september 2006 in a mosaic that has become one of @entity9 's most beloved images , i have wanted to do it all over again , only better , ' said @entity57			2
' and this time i wanted to turn the entire event into an opportunity for everyone around the globe , at the same time , to savor the uniqueness of our beautiful blue - ocean planet and the preciousness of the life on it			0
' it will be a day for all the world to celebrate			0

@entity0 's @entity9 probe has been orbiting @entity4 for almost nine years
the space agency plan to use the probe to photograph @entity2 in july and is asking people to stop and wave at the night sky when the shot is taken
photos will be possible because a rare solar eclipse between the @entity164 and @entity4 will shield the sensitive camera from damaging rays
