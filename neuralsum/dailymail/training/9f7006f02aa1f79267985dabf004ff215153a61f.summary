about 140 pilot whales that stranded themselves on a remote stretch of @entity4 beach have died , after the creatures initially became stranded on friday			1
tragic scenes show the carcasses of the whales half - submerged and stretched out along kilometres of the @entity9 on the northern tip of @entity4 's @entity11			1
conservation workers and volunteers are hoping the remaining 60 or so will survive after they managed to get them refloated and back out to sea			1
the stranding of the 198 whales on friday was one of the largest in recent years and prompted 80 workers and volunteers to help out			1
by late saturday , 140 of the whales had died , said @entity30 manager @entity29			1
he said the workers and volunteers worked throughout the day to keep the surviving whales watered and covered before refloating them during saturday night 's high tide			1
' we 've had a really good crew of volunteers , and people have been wanting to come from all over the country , ' mr @entity29 revealed			0
he also said the surviving whales had moved to deeper water			2
but he cautioned that while hopes for their survival were high , whales had been refloated in the past only to return and get stranded again			1
a woman and children observe the carcasses of dozens of pilot whales beached over the weekend experts said the scale of the stranding has been tough on the helpers , both physically and emotionally mr @entity29 said the scale of the stranding has been tough on the helpers , both physically and emotionally			1
' it 's very sad , they 're very intelligent animals , ' he said			2
' the pragmatic view is that it 's part of nature			2
' the focus will now turn to the dead whales , and the enormous task of dealing with the carcasses , @entity29 said , adding that while in the past helpers have typically buried them in the sand , he 's not sure what the approach will be this time			1
he said the department had been experimenting with tethering or moving carcasses into the water , which has the advantage of providing food for other sea creatures			0
experts describe @entity9 , located on the northwest corner of the @entity11 , as a whale trap due to the way its shallow waters seem to confuse whales and diminish their ability to navigate			2
on saturday authorities expressed concern for the remaining whales as weather conditions proved too warm for the animals , the @entity81 reports			0
a first attempt to re-float the whales during high tide at about 5pm failed , with many whales becoming re-stranded			0
mr @entity29 asked the public to leave the rescue to trained volunteers , most of whom are from the community group @entity96 , due to the risks involved in refloating operations			0
tragic scenes show the carcasses of the whales half - submerged and stretched out along kilometres of the beach ' it 's very sad , they 're very intelligent animals , ' @entity30 manager @entity29 said however , he estimated up to 500 volunteers would be needed to keep the whales cool and wet until the next high tide on saturday			1
' we 'll just keep on trying , ' mr @entity29 told the @entity81			0
're - floating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job , so it 's important we have the right people on the ground tonight trying to get these whales back to safety , ' he said on friday			1
however , he added that there was a possibility the whales would need to be euthanized if they remained stranded			2
stranded whales can become dehydrated quickly , suffer sunburns and can die from their own weight crushing their organs			2
the stranded pod , which includes many young whales as well as adults , are beached up to 6km up the shoreline			2
' it 's like a hapu or a village			0
it 's a whole mixed family group , ' mr @entity29 said			0
the stranded pod , which includes many young whales as well as adults , are beached up to 6km up the shoreline up to 500 volunteers were predicted to be needed to keep the animals cool and wet on saturday attempts to refloat the whales during a high tide failed , with volunteers planning try again at the next high tide the reason that whales become stranded is not completely understood , however it is considered a natural phenomenon			1
' possibly the leader is sick or disoriented and the herd simply follows the leader or a young whale may strand by accident and the rest of the herd try to come to the rescue , ' the @entity153 's website states			0
' they may run into problems when the shoreline is gently sloping ; sand and mud absorb the sonar signals they use for navigation , giving a false indication of deeper water			0
' mr @entity29 said the shallow hook - like nature of the beach was likely to have influenced the event			0
' people should bring buckets , spades and old sheets			0
a bus will be put on from @entity172 at the base of @entity9			0
people need to be prepared with sunscreen , hats , water , food and warm clothing if they want to assist , ' he said of saturday 's operation			0
both young and adult whales are part of the pod that are stranded up to 6km up the beach the reason whales become stranded are not completely understood by scientists			1

a total of 198 pilot whales are stranded on @entity4 's south *island*
at least 140 have died , with many suffering dehydration and sunburn
about 60 of the whales have been refloated and are expected to survive
the reason for the natural phenomenon is not completely understood
