by @entity0 published : 15:26 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 15:26 est , 15 march 2013 @entity1 and @entity2 were at loggerheads tonight after only one country backed @entity6 and @entity7 ’s call to arm the @entity9 rebels			1
at a summit in @entity13 today , the prime minister and @entity7 president @entity11 urged other @entity15 leaders to back their call for the lifting of an @entity19 - wide arms embargo on the war - torn state			1
but they embarrassingly found themselves in a minority of three - with only @entity24 coming out to support their stance			0
@entity27 to head : @entity1 and @entity28 chancellor @entity2 came to verbal blows after @entity2 refused to support @entity6 and @entity7 in their call to lift the @entity19 - wide arms embargo on @entity9 @entity28 chancellor @entity2 warned of the danger that lifting the embargo could lead to arms falling into the hands of dangerous @entity36			1
and the @entity37 threatened to pull their @entity39 troops out of the @entity41 - land disputed between @entity42 and @entity9 - if @entity6 and @entity7 unilaterally lifted their embargo			1
mr @entity1 and president @entity11 warned that if they did not get the support they needed , they would effectively veto the extension of the existing @entity19 ban on supplying weapons to either side of the bloody conflict , which has already claimed more than 70,000 lives			1
this would enable countries that wished to do so to supply the rebels			0
mr @entity1 believes it is becoming increasingly important to arm ‘ moderate ’ rebels to prevent the uprising being taken over by jidahist fighters who are flooding into the country			1
arming @entity9 : @entity1 , pictured at the summit today , said that it was becoming increasingly important to arm the ' moderate ' groups of @entity9 rebels in order to prevent the uprising being turned into a jihad war a @entity70 source said there was a ‘ perversity ’ about the existing arms embargo , which meant that the rebels were receiving no outside help when @entity76 and @entity77 are arming @entity9 dictator @entity78			1
@entity79 has been the main ally of @entity78 , shielding him from @entity39 sanctions and supplying him with weapons during the two - year conflict			0
but despite @entity6 and @entity7 ’s forthright arguments at the @entity19 council meeting in @entity13 yesterday , only one country - @entity24 - came out in support			1
chancellor @entity2 said she was concerned weapons would end up in the wrong hands			2
‘ it is an extremely difficult situation , ’ she said at a press conference			0
‘ we have a whole series of reservations regarding weapons exports to the opposition			0
we have to ask ourselves whether we are not further fuelling the conflict by doing that			0
’ action : @entity7 president @entity11 , pictured with his partner @entity100 , has said he wants the weapons embargo lifted with immediate effects ‘ we all are deeply concerned about the desperate situation in @entity9 , ’ she said			1
‘ @entity15 can only play a strong and effective role if it acts as one			0
if partners want to revisit common decisions we should hear them out and decide jointly			0
’ @entity19 foreign policy chief @entity109 said that lifting the arms blockade could be seized on by supporters of the regime to channel even more arms to bolster @entity78 ’s military campaign			2
and @entity116 prime minister @entity115 warned the @entity6 and @entity7 against unilateral action			2
in a post-summit press conference yesterday , mr @entity1 said he disagreed with chancellor @entity2 ’s position - saying arms were going to the wrong people now			1
he said : ‘ that is what has happened already and actually it ’s important for countries like @entity6 and @entity7 , working with the @entity126 , working with other allies , to help the opposition to work with the opposition and shape the opposition and to make sure that it is those parts of the opposition that support a democratic , pluralistic @entity9 where minorities are properly protected , those are the organisations getting our help and getting our assistance			1
’ however , mr @entity1 ’s language was much less bellicose than president @entity11 , who has said he would like to start arming the @entity9 rebels now			1
violent conflict : members of the @entity143 inspect the wreckage of a helicopter belonging to @entity9 president @entity78 's forces earlier this month , as the death toll for the two year civil war hit 70,000 the prime minister said : ‘ as things stand today i ’m not saying that @entity6 would actually like to supply arms to rebel groups			1
what we want to do is work with them and try to make sure that they are doing the right thing			0
‘ @entity6 is a sovereign country			2
we have our own foreign , security and defence policies			0
if we want to take individual action , of course we are free to do so			0
’ he went on : ‘ you can either keep renewing that common position or you can decide not to renew that common position			0
‘ if we thought our national interest was best met in another way , we would always stand up for @entity6 interests			2
‘ it is worth standing back and asking : why are we debating and discussing the approach we take ? the answer is two years in , 70,000 people are dead , there is a huge refugee and humanitarian crisis , @entity78 is still in place and being strongly supplied and strengthened by others and we need to put pressure on to bring about the transition necessary for @entity9 people , necessary for stability in that region and in our national interest			2
’ mr @entity1 said it would be wrong for @entity37 to pull out of the @entity41 , because arming the @entity9 rebels was a completely different issue			2
speaking at his own press conference , president @entity11 said @entity7 wanted to arm the rebels			1
‘ we are fighting terrorism around the world , ’ he said			0
‘ we have been helping the opposition in @entity9 and want to go further			0
we trust the opposition - we do not want @entity9 to become another @entity195			0

@entity6 and @entity7 urged @entity19 to lift arms *emgaro* on @entity9 at @entity13 summit
only @entity24 supported @entity1 and @entity7 president @entity11
@entity1 wants to arm ‘ moderate ’ rebels to prevent jidahists taking over
@entity28 chancellor @entity2 warned lifting ban could ' fuel conflict '
