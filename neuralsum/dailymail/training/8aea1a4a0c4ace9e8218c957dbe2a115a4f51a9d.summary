@entity0 knows the grief of miscarrying a child			1
in fact , it is something she has experienced five times over			0
so when the @entity10 mother - of - two heard the @entity12 government was for the first time acknowledging miscarried children by giving parents the option to obtain a certificate of recognition for their loss , she was over the moon			1
ms @entity0 has had five miscarriages and lost a set of twins just days after they were born			1
she is pictured here with her ' miracle baby ' @entity29 ( pictured with ms @entity30 above ) who is now 9 years old drawing from these experiences , she is now helping other parents cope with their grief			2
the now 38 - year - old lost a baby boy at 11 weeks in may 2001 when she was 25 years old			1
this child , who she later named @entity39 , was her first miscarriage			0
in november of the same year she lost baby @entity41 at nine weeks and then in april 2002 her dreams of becoming a mother slipped away again when she lost a set of twins , @entity46 and @entity47			1
@entity48 returned in may 2004 when baby @entity49 passed away five weeks after she fell pregnant			2
amid these tragedies , ms @entity30 gave birth to twins @entity52 and @entity54 - only to lose them after they were born in november 2003			1
@entity52 lived for two hours and @entity55 passed away after three days			1
they were born 24 weeks into ms @entity0 ' pregnancy			2
she has since had two healthy children , ' miracle baby ' @entity29 , 9 , who was born in 2005 and @entity59 , 19 months , in 2013			0
her girls , @entity52 and @entity54 , died in november 2003 her first husband , @entity61 , is the father of @entity29 and her lost babies , and her fiance @entity63 is father to @entity59			0
' for me , my very first loss on its own was quite devastating and distressing for me because i did n't know anyone who had experienced loss [ like this ] , ' ms @entity30 , who lives in the @entity10 , told @entity69			1
' all my sisters had healthy pregnancies and i was the oldest			0
' the main thing i felt was very lonely and isolated , and there were no online support groups - in essence - i had to deal with it on my own			0
' to add to her times of grief , ms @entity0 said some of her friends did not see her loss as a real loss			1
she stressed her close family and friends were very understanding and helped her cope with the death of her children			0
' miscarriage loss is looked at by quite a few people as not quite a big deal , it 's not a baby that you 've lost , ' ms @entity30 said			1
' that expectation that parents should move on quickly , that does n't happened in reality			2
' you ca n't just switch a button and say it 's all good			2
that puts a lot of pressure on us , and they do feel that loneliness and isolation			0
the names of her lost children - @entity39 , @entity41 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity110 and @entity55 and @entity49 - are in a framed picture as she remembers them every day			1
she would grief for them forever keepsakes from her twins , @entity52 and @entity55 , are two teddies sitting on the two quilts they lay on in hospital ' [ some people ] think we were n't really attached these babies so early into the pregnancy , but the love and the future are all embedded in them and is there from the moment we find out about the baby			1
' the big issue is that there 's still a perception that these babies are n't real babies , they 're not treated as a full - term birth			1
' but a loss is a loss and i do n't know why we need to minimise it this much			0
they have a beating heart and you ca n't question that			0
' despite it being a few years since the deaths of her children , ms @entity0 said she would spend her whole life grieving for them			1
' we invest in these [ miscarried ] babies ... and when they are taken from you it does n't make a difference when the pregnancy is lost			1
' i will always be a mum to these babies and i will carry them in my heart forever			0
' even though i 'm living my life , i never forget their birthdays			1
there is always something special i usually do for them on their birthday like i do for my two living children because they are my children			2
' fortunately ms @entity0 now has two children named @entity59 , 19 months , and @entity29 , 9			1
on the left , ms @entity0 is pictured with her children and fiance @entity63 who is @entity59 's father ms @entity0 ( again pictured with daughter @entity29 ) is also co-founder and vice-president of @entity171 - a group dedicated to helping grieving parents who lose a child from her first - hand experiences , ms @entity0 knew the @entity12 government 's move to introduce certificates of recognition for miscarriages would help grieving parents cope with the death of their child			1
' [ when i heard ] i was absolutely ecstatic , i was so emotionally overwhelmed			0
i wish it was available to me back then , ' she said			0
' this validation and acknowledgement from the government is going to shape the perception among the community and help those families grieving for their baby			0
' acknowledgement goes a long way helping parents heal and work through their grief			0
' to be able to speak of their name and acknowledge their life is music to the ears of their parent			2
' ms @entity0 has welcomed the @entity12 government 's move to introduce a certificate of recognition for miscarriages ms @entity0 said naming her lost children had helped her move forward with her life			1
' when i did i felt a big weight come off my shoulders ... i wish i had done it in the beginning , ' she said			0
the move from @entity12 comes after @entity214 , @entity215 and the @entity216 have done the same			2
the certificate of recognition was introduced just before @entity218 last year but attorney - general @entity219 made the announcement on monday			1
a miscarriage involves a child that is carried for less than 20 weeks and is below 400 grams			0
' families who experience the loss of a baby early in a pregnancy have a difficult grieving process and often feel that their loss is n't recognised , ' mr @entity219 said			0
; until now it has not been possible to receive formal recognition for the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks			0
' at the request of the government , @entity233 of @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 are issuing optional recognition certificates to parents who have experienced this tragedy			0
' the recognition certificates are not legal documents but it is hoped that , at least in some small way , a formal recognition certificate will help			2
' it is also available to parents who lost a child before the introduction date			0
partnered with raising her two children , ms @entity0 is also co-founder and vice-president of @entity253 - a group dedicated to assisting parents to deal with their miscarriage			1
' what has helped me through the years of loss , loneliness and depression [ is ] having the opportunity to speak about my babies with other bereaved parents , co-founding and managing @entity265 and writing children 's books , ' she said			2
' turning the absolute heartache into helping others has been beneficial in my own healing			0
