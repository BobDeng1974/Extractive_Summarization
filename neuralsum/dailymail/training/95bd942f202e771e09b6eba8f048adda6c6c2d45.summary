the former business secretary , one of the founders of @entity6 , suggests mr @entity2 needs to abandon his ‘ crowd - pleasing ’ promises on the cost of living and come up with ‘ counter-intuitive policies ’ instead			1
his intervention , in the @entity17 magazine , reflects growing concern in @entity6 ranks about the party ’s economic policy , which has been mocked as ‘ the politics of pointing at things and saying how expensive they are ’			1
senior figures are also urging mr @entity2 to shift his position on issues such as immigration and an @entity29 referendum – something he has so far refused to do			1
there is concern across the party at last week ’s local and @entity35 election results , which do not suggest it is on course for a majority at next year ’s general election			1
in town hall elections , @entity6 made progress in @entity42 and some other areas , but finished seven points behind what @entity45 achieved before he lost the 1992 election			1
in the @entity50 elections , the party ended up only just over one point ahead of the conservatives and was soundly beaten by @entity8 – the first time for 30 years that an opposition has not come out on top			2
@entity56 , the head of pollster @entity58 , yesterday told a conference organised by @entity61 campaign group progress : ‘ on a government versus opposition basis , i think these figures really are bad for @entity6 ... @entity6 should be terrified by these results			1
‘ i have been on the pessimists ’ end of analysts of @entity6 ’s standing and i have to say i thought the vote last week justified the pessimists and did nothing to justify the @entity6 optimists			2
’ in his article , @entity1 said it was clear @entity8 had had ‘ a good week ’			0
‘ the challenge for them is to build a genuine movement beyond a charismatic leader , a band of fruitcake candidates and a clutch of reactionary ideas , ’ he added			0
‘ i doubt they will succeed			0
in my political career we ’ve seen two similar " breakthrough " moments , both in the 1980s : the @entity92 ’s rise and fall , then the @entity90 coming and going			0
‘ those parties ’ success was only due to @entity6 ’s weakness			2
when @entity6 got its act together , their appeal faded			2
the same has to happen now , if @entity6 wants to become more than a minority administration in 2015			2
' @entity99 , the party ’s election chief , said : " @entity6 can win the general election if we take the right steps between now and a year ’s time			1
" ' the “ if ” has to include fewer crowd - pleasing cost - of - living promises and more counter-intuitive policies			0
’ lord @entity1 's intervention reflects growing concern in @entity6 ranks about the party 's economic policy , which has been mocked as ' the politics of pointing at things and saying how expensive they are ' mr @entity2 ’s allies dismiss the suggestion that he has been complacent about the rise of @entity8 in working class @entity6 areas – insisting @entity120 and his ministers are to blame			1
one shadow cabinet ally told the left - wing @entity124 magazine : ‘ the idea that , suddenly , because of the magic abilities of @entity127 , @entity8 have come out of nowhere to do what they did in the @entity35 and the locals is wrong ; it ’s absurd and incorrect			0
‘ we ’re reaping what we sowed back in ’ 97 through to 2005 , when we gave the impression to our working - class heartlands that they were communities that we took for granted			0

though its election results were better than expected , they suggested the party will also struggle to assemble a majority , raising the prospect of another coalition			0
the @entity158 are ‘ throwing everything ’ at fending off the @entity8 threat in the @entity150 poll , which has been triggered by the resignation of disgraced mp @entity163			0
mr @entity164 has invested great personal capital in the contest , having already made two campaign visits to the constituency himself .			0
