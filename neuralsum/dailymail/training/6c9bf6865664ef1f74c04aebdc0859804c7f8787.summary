the former head of the @entity1 has offered an unflinching defense of the horrific treatment of terror suspects outlined in a @entity8 @entity7 report - saying intelligence officers were carrying out ' nation 's will ' and had developed a ' social contract with the @entity8 people			1
' @entity13 also blasted the @entity7 torture report , which detailed horrific abuse of detainees at the hands of @entity1 operatives , as a one - sided ' prosecutor screed ' and said it was the result of a partisan investigation that began with a ' predetermined outcome			1
' ' let me be very candid			0
we thought we were doing the nation 's will			0
and in fact , having lived through the period and even looking back on it now			0
i think this was indeed about the nation 's will , ' @entity13 , who served as director of the @entity1 under @entity30 from 2006 until 2009 , said on @entity33 on wednesday			1
" frankly , that really is hypocritical			0
' when asked how he knew it was the desire of the @entity8 people top carry out torture he said : ' we 've got a system			1
we get to elect a president , we get to elect a @entity58			2
we have an attorney general			2
' these activities , the president authorized them			0
the @entity58 was briefed , without objection , and we carried them out			2
' how else are we supposed to know the nation 's will ? you want a plebiscite on convert activities ? ' he also hit back against claims from the @entity7 report that torture was n't effective in extracting meaningful intelligence			1
he told @entity73 : ' these interrogations … gave us kind of a @entity76 - like storage of information on @entity78 on which we relied			0
we are still relying on it today			0
' in an interview with @entity82 he said that before his 2007 @entity58 testimony , he demanded the truth about the efficacy of torture from his underlings at the @entity1			1
he said he told his deputy director : ‘ do n’t f * * * with me			0
if this story is n’t airtight then i ’m not saying it to @entity58			2
’ ' they came back and said our version of the story is correct			0
because of this program ( @entity96 ) @entity95 begat @entity98 , who begat others			0
we learned a great deal from the detainees			0
' @entity95 , a @entity102 national who was water boarded 83 times , ran a terrorist training camp in @entity106 and has been described as one of @entity109 's top aides			0
@entity98 , or @entity98 , was the principle architect of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the @entity8			1
@entity13 , who has been accused of lying to @entity58 during his 2007 testimony about the @entity1 's ' enhanced interrogation program , ' also criticized tuesday 's @entity7 report			1
' i do n't know that the report that was released yesterday is that historically accurate			2
it reads like a prosecutorial screed rather than a historical document , ' he told @entity120 's today show			2
he said on @entity33 : ' they opted for the 6 million document fish in order to pull out of things , perhaps out of context , in order to make what appears to be a predetermined point			0
' @entity13 , a retired @entity8 @entity128 general , has been accused to lying to @entity58 during his 2007 testimony about the enhanced interrogation program			1
he says he never lied the 6,000 page @entity7 report was written entirely by @entity133 staffers after nearly every @entity7 @entity134 refused to be involved in the investigation			1
republicans issued a rebuttal to the report , calling it sloppy and partisan			0
@entity13 still maintains that what @entity1 officers carried out was not torture - and that it was legal and approved by the @entity142 , the attorney general and select members of @entity58 who were briefed on the matter			1
former deputy director of the @entity1 @entity147 told @entity148 : ' one of the reasons i react so strongly , as does @entity151 , to people calling it torture , was that the @entity155 told us at time , this is legal , this is not torture			1
so when people call it torture , i react strongly because it says my officers tortured people -- they did not torture anybody			2
' nearly all of the horrific behavior detailed in the @entity7 torture report happened before @entity13 was @entity167 - though he served as head of the @entity169 from 1999 until 2005 and then deputy director of national intelligence from 2005 until his 2006 appointment as the head of the @entity1			1
he also denies that he lied to @entity58 during his 2007 testimony and offered a counter-punch - saying that senator @entity175 , who released the torture report - was briefed about all the details of the @entity1 torture program as early as 2006 - and that little of the information in the report is new			1
' i did n't lie and i did n't mislead @entity58 , ' he said			1
' ... i actually argued within the ( @entity30 ) administration that we needed to tell all the members of the ( @entity185 ) committee going forward			0
' and we needed to devise a plan that was not just based on raw presidential authority , but had political support from the other political branch so that going forward this would no longer be @entity30 's program , but would be @entity8 's program			2
' finally , @entity13 warned that the damning torture report could put @entity8 at risk for another major terrorist attack by cowing the @entity1			1
' we 're going to end up a @entity1 that is timid			2
the very charge that was made against us - the very charge that was made against us before 9/11			0
' visit @entity197 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy			0

@entity13 has said that president @entity30 approved the torture , @entity58 knew about it and the attorney general signed off on it
@entity13 , who was @entity1 director from 2006 until 2009 , says the agency has a ' social contract with the @entity8 people ' over the use of torture
says he did n't lie to @entity58 , despite claims that he misled about extent of the ' high value detainee ' program
blasted the @entity7 report as a ' prosecutorial screed ' that had a ' predetermined outcome '
he maintains , as do other former @entity1 leaders , that the agency never tortured anyone because the harsh interrogation was deemed legal at the time
says *backlash* against the @entity1 will leave it weak and timid - and open @entity8 to more terrorist attacks
