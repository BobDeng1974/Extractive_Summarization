from @entity1 to @entity2 to @entity3 , fictional bears are often friendly beasts			0
however , their real life counterparts tend to have grizzlier reputations , which is why photographer @entity8 , 31 , could barely believe his eyes when one of the creatures starting waving at him			1
mr @entity8 took these hilarious snaps at @entity13 while on a trip to @entity15 from his home in @entity17 , @entity18			2
the bear entertained visitors to @entity13 by sitting at the edge of his enclosure and waving excitedly at them the friendly animal wandered to the front of his enclosure before sitting back in full view of zoo guests and lifting his powerful paw in a decidedly wave - like motion			1
mr @entity8 said : ' the bear seemed extremely happy - the more people waved back at him the longer he waved for			2
witnesses said the more people waved back at the bear , the more effort it seemed to put into its own actions the snaps were taken by keen @entity18 photographer @entity8 at @entity13 while on a visit to @entity15 after several minutes of waving on his own , other bears started following the example set by the friendly beast ' he was waving for about three minutes and then the other bears started copying him too			1
' i 'd only ever seen this kind of behaviour before in a circus so perhaps that 's what he used to do			0
' apparently they wave to zookeepers when they want feeding so they try to get food from guests too - it looks like a restaurant			0
' i was glad i had my camera with me to capture this funny moment			0
' the bears are known to wave at zookeepers when they are hungry and this bear was likely looking for a snack mr @entity8 had only seen bears act this way in the circus and wondered if this animal was an ex-performer mr @entity8 said the bear seemed extremely happy and was enjoying the attention from passers - by			1

the bear entertained passers - by at @entity13 with its antics
these snaps were taken by @entity18 photographer @entity8 , 31
