a police officer accused of describing three black men as ‘ f * * * * * g monkeys ’ claimed he was just having a discussion about ‘ evolution , ’ a court heard today			1
@entity7 @entity6 , 42 , allegedly made the racist remark while on patrol with three fellow officers in @entity11 - one of @entity13 ’s most ethnically diverse communities			1
as they passed three black men leaning against a wall in @entity18 , @entity19 , the officer allegedly said : ‘ look at them , they look like f * * * ing monkeys			0
’ but @entity6 told @entity24 he had simply remarked on a man ’s gait and posture while talking about the scientific theory to pc @entity29 ‘ i had engaged with @entity31 , we were discussing about evolution or terms of that kind , ’ he said			1
‘ we were in the car , i had a fleeting glance to my right hand side and saw a gentleman			0
i said that man there was walking like a monkey			2
@entity6 said that when challenged by @entity31 , he immediately replied that ' it ’s nothing to do with him being black , ' but he was ' just trying to reference by point that some human beings have some characteristics that resemble monkeys			1
' he added that he considered his own ‘ sticking out ears ’ to resemble that of a monkey and that others ’ noses or lips might also do so			0
during the discussion he also said black people were closely related to ‘ chimpanzees and @entity57 , ’ it is claimed			0
when asked if he had used either of the words , he said might have used the former , but did not even know what @entity57 meant			0
cross-examined by prosecutor @entity60 , he admitted that he was aware of the racial connotations between black people and monkeys and that he had described the man on the street as walking like monkey			1
but @entity6 told the court that he found it ‘ upsetting ’ and ‘ ridiculous ’ that he was being accused of being racist			2
he admitted that he would often greet his colleagues on the @entity70 team , based at @entity71 , by using an @entity73 accent and saying ‘ @entity74			0
’ but he maintained that he was not being racist and meant no disrespect			0
he also denied that on one occasion he had told pc @entity78 , 42 , that they could not use the words in front of a @entity73 special constable in case she complained			1
the former personal trainer added the he had ‘ many , many , many ’ @entity73 friends , as well as black friends , @entity90 friends and @entity92 friends			0
