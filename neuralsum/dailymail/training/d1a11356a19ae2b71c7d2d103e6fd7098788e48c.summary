by @entity0 published : 09:54 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 3 february 2013 a @entity2 ad that was banned from sunday night ’s game can now be viewed by anyone online and the company behind it is reaping the benefits			2
@entity8 , which makes home water carbonators used to whip up homemade soda , directly challenged @entity11 and @entity12 in its commercial that was set to air in the fourth quarter			1
' because @entity8 is a direct competitor of the @entity27 brands that tend to be ubiquitous during the @entity2 , ' @entity8 told @entity28 , ' the rejection of one of the company 's proposed ads , which takes aim at @entity27 , is perhaps not surprising			1
' @entity35 stir : @entity8 , which makes at - home soda makers , maintains they did not intend to stir up trouble with the ad the ad pits a @entity11 and a @entity12 delivery driver against each other in a duelling banjos moment that culminates in both drivers ’ merchandise exploding as a man opts for @entity8 , instead			1
@entity48 : the @entity50 company has experienced this before , when a @entity53 ad was banned , leading to record profits it was reported banned on friday			1
this is not an unusual occurrence			0
the biggest night in football draws a massive viewership and seconds - long ads can cost millions			0
but @entity8 claims they did n’t intend for their ad to be cancelled , as other advertisers have been doing for years to win some cheap @entity35 forced to rework the commercial for air during @entity67 , the original spot has now gone viral on the internet and @entity8 has been rewarded with a mountain of publicity nonetheless			2
despite their claims to innocence in the matter , this a path the company has gone down before			0
an ad intended for @entity53 viewers was banned by the company @entity77 in november 2012 for the exact same issue when the broadcaster claimed the spot " denigrated other soft drinks			0
" @entity8 subsequently posted its largest ever stock market gains			0
prior to that , the company received a cease and desist demand from @entity11 after placing displays made out of used water bottles and soda cans that portrayed the company as wasteful in @entity90 and elsewhere			1
it remains unclear if the @entity50 company is intentionally culling publicity from its advertising misbehaviour			2
however , @entity8 will certainly win at least a few fans as the banned @entity2 ad gains millions of free views on @entity98 .			0

@entity8 ad took aim at @entity11 and @entity12
the @entity50 home soda maker company has run into problems for its commercials before
