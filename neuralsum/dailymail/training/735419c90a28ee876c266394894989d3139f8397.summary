you must be toking : @entity2 's unprecedented plan to put the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry has made it halfway through congress @entity2 moved a step closer to becoming the first country in the world to legalise marijuana today in a last - ditch assault on the country 's ruthless drug cartels			1
the bill , if passed , would allow anyone to grow , sell and consume cannabis freely , while a confidential registry would keep people from buying more than 40 grams a month			1
the unprecedented plan to put the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry has already made it halfway through congress , giving president @entity25 a long - sought victory in his effort to explore alternatives to the global war on drugs			1
all 50 members of the governing @entity33 coalition approved the proposal in a party line vote just before midnight wednesday , keeping a narrow majority of the 96 lawmakers present after more than 13 hours of passionate debate			1
the measure now goes to the @entity40 , where @entity42 's coalition has a bigger majority and passage is expected to come within weeks for the proposal to make @entity2 the world 's first nation to create a legal , regulated marijuana market			1
' sometimes small countries do great things , ' said @entity51 , executive director of the @entity53 @entity52			0
' @entity2 's bold move does more than follow in the footsteps of @entity56 and @entity57			0
it provides a model for legally regulating marijuana that other countries , and @entity53 states , will want to consider - and a precedent that will embolden others to follow in their footsteps			1
' marijuana legalization efforts have gained momentum across the @entity68 in recent years as leaders watch the death toll rise from military responses to unabated drug trafficking in @entity73 and @entity74			1
presidents @entity76 of @entity77 and @entity78 of @entity79 also have called for reforms , and a recent report by a commission of the @entity83 encouraged new approaches , including legalization of marijuana			1
but no sitting president has gone as far as @entity42 to support the creation of legal alternatives to marijuana trafficking			2
' at the heart of the @entity2 marijuana regulation bill is a focus on improving public health and public safety , ' said @entity96 , a @entity52 staffer who moved to @entity97 to help shepherd the proposal			1
' instead of closing their eyes to the problem of drug abuse and drug trafficking , @entity2 is taking an important step towards responsible regulation of an existing reality			2
' legislators in the governing coalition said putting the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry is worth trying because the global war on drugs had been a costly and bloody failure , and displacing illegal dealers through licensed pot sales could save money and lives			1
trailblazer : president @entity25 a long - sought victory in his effort to explore alternatives to the global war on drugs pot in my back yard : critics warned that marijuana is a gateway drug and said fostering the bad habits of addicts is playing with fire they also hope to eliminate a legal contradiction in @entity2 , where it has been legal to use pot but against the law to sell it , buy it , produce it or possess even one marijuana plant			1
critics warned that marijuana is a gateway drug and said fostering the bad habits of addicts is playing with fire			1
@entity42 said he never consumed marijuana , but believes regulations are necessary because many other people do , even though recent polls suggest two - thirds of @entity2 oppose the plan			2
there is a popular misconception that marijuana is already legal in @entity149			2
however , although it is technically illegal there , the drug is widely available as police ca n't prosecute people for possession of small amounts			2
the country 's many licensed ' coffee shops ' are a huge tourist attraction in @entity160 with an estimated one million holidaymakers a year , including @entity162 , heading to @entity163 to legally buy and smoke drugs			2
the @entity149 decriminalised soft drugs in the 1970s , making it legal to buy up to 5g of marijuana from licensed vendors			1
there are currently around 750 coffee shops in the country , with around 220 of those in @entity163 , mostly in the city 's famous red light district where prostitution is also legal			0
when the law was proposed the @entity149 health and justice ministries said : ' we attract other types of tourists apart from drugs tourists			2
' this law will put an end to the nuisance and criminality associated with coffee shops and drugs trafficking			2
' those opposing the law cited a fear that @entity149 residents could sell the marijuana they could legally purchase on to tourists at an inflated price			0
@entity197 deputy @entity196 said the government was underestimating the risk of marijuana , which he called a ' gateway drug ' for other chemical addictions that foster violent crimes			1
' ninety - eight percent of those who are today destroying themselves with base cocaine began with marijuana , ' @entity196 said			0
' i believe that we 're risking too much			0
i have the sensation that we 're playing with fire			0
' under the legislation , carrying , growing or selling pot without a license could bring prison terms , but licensed consumers could grow up to six plants at a time at home			0
growing clubs with up to 45 members each would be encouraged , fostering enough marijuana production to drive out unlicensed dealers and draw a line between pot smokers and users of harder drugs			1
the latest proposal ' has some adjustments , aimed at strengthening the educational issue and prohibiting driving under the effects of cannabis , ' ruling coalition deputy @entity226 said			0
' there will be self - growing clubs , and it will also be possible to buy marijuana in pharmacies ' that is mass - produced by private companies			0
an @entity239 would be created , with the power to grant licenses for all aspects of a legal industry to produce marijuana for recreational , medicinal or industrial use			0
dozens of pro-marijuana activists followed the debate from balconies overlooking the house floor , while others outside held signs and danced to reggae music			0
' this law consecrates a reality that already exists : the marijuana sales market has existed for a long time , but illegally , buying it from traffickers , and in having plants in your house for which you can be thrown in jail , ' said @entity263 , a 25 - year - old anthropology student			0
' we want to put an end to this , to clean up and normalize the situation			0
' @entity268 - rous game : marijuana legalization efforts have gained momentum across the @entity68 in recent years as leaders watch the death toll rise from military responses to unabated drug trafficking in @entity73 and @entity74 reformists : presidents @entity76 of @entity77 , right , and @entity78 of @entity79 , left , have also called for reforms the heavy toll , costs and questionable results of military responses to illegal drugs have motivated marijuana legalization initiatives in the @entity53 states of @entity56 and @entity57 , and inspired many world leaders to re-think drug laws			1
the secretary - general of the @entity83 , @entity289 , told @entity42 last week that his members had no objections			0
@entity292 , however , said during his visit to @entity294 that the ' liberalization of drugs , which is being discussed in several @entity298 countries , is not what will reduce the spread of chemical substances			0

proposal has been approved by government , now goes to the @entity40
it will license growers , sellers and users , *limiting* buyers to *40g* a month
it comes as global war on drugs is *condemned* as costly and bloody failure
other @entity318 leaders considering *similar* moves to stifle cartels
but critics warn marijuana is ' gateway drug ' that leads to other addictions
