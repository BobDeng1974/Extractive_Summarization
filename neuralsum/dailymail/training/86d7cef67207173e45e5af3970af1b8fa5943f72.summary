@entity1 col. @entity0 commanded @entity2 in @entity3 when terrorists attacked the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
the @entity8 has caved to congressional requests to make him available to answer questions about that attack , which left the @entity13 ambassador dead the @entity13 @entity8 has agreed to make available to @entity14 a @entity1 colonel who was in command of @entity17 in @entity3 on the night armed terrorists staged a military - style assault on an @entity13 diplomatic outpost in @entity6 , @entity7			1
a series of requests for @entity1 col. @entity0 's testimony from @entity26 rep. @entity25 and @entity28 sen. @entity27 , both republicans , had fallen on deaf ears until friday			1
the @entity8 had claimed that since @entity31 had retired , it ' can not compel ' him to tell congressional panels what he knows about the @entity6 attack			1
@entity25 said on july 9 that the @entity8 was ' not willing to pass along any sort of information ' related to @entity31 's whereabouts			2
now @entity40 maj. @entity39 has confirmed to @entity41 that due to an ' administrative error , ' @entity31 was mistakenly classified as a retired officer despite his current active - duty status			2
' the @entity8 has fully cooperated with congressional requests to understand the attacks on the @entity6 compound , ' @entity39 said			2
' col. @entity0 , @entity1 , will be available to meet with @entity50 and @entity51 members and their staffs			2
' @entity41 has located @entity31 's home in @entity54 in recent weeks			0
on thursday evening a woman answered the door and confirmed that he lived there , but the colonel himself has not responded to four separate requests for an interview			0
sources have said @entity31 was out of the country on non-military business until july 14			0
@entity25 's and @entity27 's offices did not immediately offer reactions to the @entity8 's change of heart			2
rep. @entity25 ( @entity70 ) and sen. @entity27 ( r ) have been among the driving forces behind obtaining testimony from key military and civilian witnesses to the @entity6 attack			1
' you ca n't do a thorough investigation without talking to everyone who knows something or saw something , ' @entity25 told @entity41 on july 9 @entity39 told @entity41 that the about - face came after sen. @entity27 sent a letter to defense secretary @entity85 on thursday , asking for reconsideration			1
that move followed a report in the @entity89 , which cited a @entity1 source in concluding that @entity31 's retirement would not become final until august 1			0
on tuesday @entity39 had told the newspaper , in error , that ' col. @entity31 was not invited by @entity14 to testify before he retired			1
' @entity31 's testimony could provide a crucial missing link in lawmakers ' understanding of what happened in @entity6			2
in his letter to defense secretary @entity85 on thursday , sen. @entity27 cited @entity31 's ' in - depth knowledge of the region , coupled with his close interaction with @entity104 operating on the @entity106 continent			1
' ' [ @entity108 ] e would be the ideal person to speak with , ' @entity27 wrote , ' about what happened on the ground in @entity6			2
' @entity8 spokesman maj. @entity39 ( @entity70 ) confirmed that @entity31 would be made available to @entity14			1
that followed a letter from sen. @entity27 to defense secretary @entity85 ( r ) in particular , @entity115 in both the @entity50 and @entity51 have been frustrated by their inability to learn why @entity2 were prevented from boarding a military plane in @entity118 during the sept. 11 , 2012 attack - a plane that was already preparing to take off for @entity6			1
@entity13 ambassador to @entity7 @entity121 , and three other @entity13 personnel , died in the attack			0
on that day , @entity31 was commander of @entity125 , placing him directly in the chain of command where decisions were made about evaluating and deploying assault teams when @entity13 personnel in @entity3 are in harm 's way			0
other military officials have testified before @entity14 , including gen. @entity134 , who appeared on june 26 before a closed session of the @entity136			0
@entity7 military guards stood watch over the burned - out @entity139 in @entity6 just three days after the attack			1
the @entity141 did n't arrive on the scene to investigate for nearly three weeks @entity13 ambassador to @entity7 @entity121 and three other @entity13 were killed in the @entity6 attack , and @entity14 is still investigating @entity31 â€™s @entity146 profile indicates that he led a task force with authority over military special operations in 12 countries , including forces tasked with countering violent extremist organizations			1
during a change of command ceremony in march 2013 that saw him rotated out of command , he said ' an evil ' had taken hold in @entity3 , and ' it is on us to stomp it out			0
' ' @entity3 is not the next ridgeline , ' @entity31 told @entity164			0
' it is where the enemy is going now			0
and we are going to do something about it			0
' a @entity8 official told @entity41 that incorrect information about @entity31 's retirement date reflected ' confusion within different offices in the @entity8 , ' and was not a concerted effort to keep the colonel from testifying			0
but ' we just do n't keep a database of where people are ' after they retire from active duty , the official added			0
at that point , ' the @entity182 is responsible for supporting them			0
they would have a better link to a retiree than the @entity8 would			0
' general @entity134 , the commander of the @entity13 military 's @entity188 when the @entity6 consulate came under attack , testified before a @entity14 panel despite his non-active - duty status because his retirement was n't yet official			1
the @entity8 now says col. @entity31 's situation is a similar one the @entity13 @entity5 in @entity6 is seen in flames after terror organizations , including the @entity200 - linked group @entity199 , bombarded the @entity202 's outposts there			1

col. @entity0 was in charge of @entity2 in @entity3 on the night of the @entity6 , @entity7 terror attack
the @entity208 had *refused* to tell @entity14 where to find him , claiming that he was retired and entitled to *protection* under *privacy* laws
after pressure from sen. @entity27 , the @entity8 has changed its mind - now acknowledging that @entity31 is not yet retired
questions remain about why commandos were not sent to @entity6 on sept. 11 , 2012 , even though a team was standing by to board a plane
