by @entity0 a diabetic sufferer in @entity2 has trained his own pet to alert him to changes in his blood sugar levels after being told it would cost $ 25,000 for a medical assistance dog			1
when @entity10 had type 2 diabetes diagnosed in 2012 his doctor suggested using a specially trained dog , but with a hefty price tag it was n't an option he could afford			0
instead , he and his wife @entity16 brought an adorable @entity17 called @entity18 that they have trained themselves			2
life saver : @entity10 with @entity18 the dog that he trained to alert him to changes in his blood sugar levels ' i thought that i had trained dogs in obedience before , why ca n’t i train my own diabetic alert dog ? ' mr @entity10 told the @entity28			1
dogs have more than 200,000 sensors in their nose which help them detect tiny changes in a human			0
when a diabetic 's blood sugar level drops , the change can be detected by the dogs through the person 's sweat and breath			1
if a diabetic alert assistance dog detects those changes it will alert its owner in one of several ways , such as tapping them with a paw , or sitting directly in front of them			0
while the dogs are no replacement for medication or devices used to control and monitor diabetes , they play a valuable role in early detection , which can also boost the patient 's confidence			0
' technically anybody can do it ; it ’s just the time commitment , ' he added			0
like other diabetic alert medical assistance dogs , @entity18 is able to detect the tiny changes in mr @entity10 that show his blood sugar levels are low			1
the dog then touches its owner with its paw , to let them know they need to take an insulin injection			0
training @entity18 to spot the symptoms started when he was just a puppy , and began with basic commands most people teach their pets			2
' the obedience and everything is the same			0
you still start with that and make sure they have their obedience			0
as far as the scent training and things , you start them off very early , ' mrs @entity83 told @entity87			0
for the scent training , @entity18 was taught to detect saliva samples taken from patients with high or low blood sugar			1
as well as training at home , @entity18 and his owners flew to @entity95 for a four - day intensive workshop to improve his skills			1
dog school : @entity10 works on a training session with @entity18 smell of success : samples of saliva are hidden in tubes to teach @entity18 to detect changes in blood sugar levels it was n't long before @entity18 's training paid off			1
in january mr @entity10 had been working outside on his car , and had missed a meal			0
when he walked inside @entity18 immediately tapped him with his paw to warn that his blood sugar level was low			1
after their success with @entity18 , the @entity113 realized they could use their experience to train other dogs to help patients who , like them , would struggle to pay for a more expensive dog			2
they recently brought home a new addition to the family - rouge - who will go from wriggling pup to life - saver in just under a year			2
the couple have also set up @entity127 , which they are applying to have listed as a non-profit group , so they can expand their training program			0
new recruit : the @entity113 are training a second pup , @entity133 , for other diabetic patients while the dogs are no replacement for devices that monitor sugar levels for diabetics , they work as an invaluable early - warning system			1
the dogs are capable of letting their owners know about changes in nearly every situation , and will even wake a sleeping diabetic if they detect a drop in sugar levels			1
' this early alert to shifts in blood sugar is a huge relief to diabetics and parents of diabetics struggling to identify such changes before they result in uncomfortable symptoms , ' the @entity148 said .			2

owners plan to train more puppies for other patients on limited *budgets*
