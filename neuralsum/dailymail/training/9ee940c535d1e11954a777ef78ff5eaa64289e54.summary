an explosive new book has claimed that the @entity1 was ' insane and inebriated ' during the final 20 years of her life			1
the book , a biography of the @entity1 's steward @entity5 , also makes a number of allegations about the rest of the royal family , including accusations of drunkenness and swearing			1
but courtiers have hit back , with the @entity1 's cousin @entity14 , a former lady - in - waiting herself , describing the book as ' disgusting ' and ' nonsense '			1
' to write such absolute nonsense about someone who is dead and unable to answer back is disgusting			2
' @entity27 : the @entity28 of @entity5 is the work of historical novelist @entity30 , whose oeuvre includes works on angling and shooting as well as a series of memoirs based on the lives of aristocratic serving staff			1
in the blurb for the book , which is due to be published in march 2015 , @entity30 describes @entity5 as ' charming , amusing , occasionally bitchy - and extremely promiscuous '			2
@entity5 , who was known as @entity39 and was the son of a shopkeeper , worked for the @entity1 for more than 50 years			1
memories : mr @entity5 , seen here dancing with the @entity1 , worked for the royal for more than 50 years faithful : mr @entity5 , who died in 2007 , never spoke about his royal employer during her lifetime close : mr @entity5 ( pictured left at the @entity1 's funeral ) was left devastated by her death in 2002 the equerry , who died in 2007 , was still working for the royal when she died at the age of 101 in 2002			1
' as a child growing up in relative poverty in @entity56 , @entity39 thought working for the royal family would be hugely glamorous , ' continues the blurb			2
' as a teenager he sent letters to the royal household begging to be taken on			0
it was a shock , however , when he found himself barely out of his teens and working for a family that had two very different sides			0
' as far as the public was concerned , the royal family was a model of reticence			0
but @entity39 saw the other side of a family whose members loved drinking and smoking , swearing and playing sometimes cruel practical jokes on each other in private			0
' they hated anything serious and were constantly making jokes at each other 's expense			2
the @entity1 was especially good at all this , according to @entity39			2
nonsense : the @entity1 's niece @entity14 has rubbished the claims , saying they are ' nonsense ' bitchy : according to the book , the royal family are fond of playing cruel practical jokes on each other hardworking : the @entity1 remained a key part of the royal family following the death of @entity94 happy marriage : the @entity1 and @entity94 while still @entity96 and @entity97 in 1926 ' this was partly because she had a great sense of fun and partly because , for the last twenty years of her life , she was dotty to the point of lunacy			1
' it also goes on to claim that the reason the @entity1 loved @entity5 so much was because he knew how to make gin and tonics the way she liked them - ' nine - tenths gin and one - tenth tonic '			1
this , says mrs @entity14 , is just one of the book 's many inaccuracies - particularly because the queen mother ' never drank a gin and tonic , not ever '			1
' she preferred a gin martini mix which she usually made herself , ' continued mrs @entity14			1
' she drank no more than one or two drinks of an evening but never drank too much			0
' she was very conscious of her standing and knew what was proper of someone in her position to do and not to do			0
' of course she had a wonderful sense of humour			0
she laughed until she cried watching programmes like @entity126 and @entity127 , but she was n’t some party girl and she certainly did n’t go potty			0
' she could talk to anyone about anything , from rhododendrons to @entity133 poetry			0
she knew her onions , right until the end			0
' @entity136 has been approached for comment			0
proud : the queen mother with the @entity1 , princess @entity138 and prince @entity139 during the @entity140 big day : the @entity1 appears on the balcony of @entity136 as monarch for the first time in june 1952 much missed : the @entity1 was known to be particularly close to @entity144 and @entity145			2
