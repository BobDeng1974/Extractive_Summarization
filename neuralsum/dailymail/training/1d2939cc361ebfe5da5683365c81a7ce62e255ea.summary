by @entity1 reporter published : 01:13 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 01:15 est , 29 july 2013 a sheriff 's office in @entity3 is under fire from gay rights advocates for targeting men using an outdated law from the early 1800s			1
according to a report published sunday in @entity10 , the @entity8 sheriff 's office has been conducting sting operations to arrest gay men looking for sex in public parks			1
over the past two years the @entity15 has arrested at least 12 men under an unenforceable ' crime against nature ' law deemed invalid by the @entity21 @entity20 a decade ago			1
outdated : a report published in @entity10 sunday revealed a two - year long series of sting operations in @entity8 that seemed to target homosexuals in the community undercover officers would meet men in the park and get them to agree to have sex , and that was enough basis to arrest them under the ' crime against nature ' law - @entity34 14:89 - which was put on the records book back in 1805			1
the statue includes language which bans ' the unnatural canal copulation by a human being with another of the same sex or opposite sex			2
' the @entity20 struck down that part in a 2003 ruling with a similar law in @entity48			1
because of the @entity20 precedent , the courts would be unable to prosecute anyone charged today with that crime			0
however , according to sheriff 's office spokesman @entity56 , since the law is on the books police still have the right to enforce it			0
she also said the men were not targeted for their sexual orientation , but because the office had been receiving complaints about people using the parks to have public sex			2
apologize : @entity68 councilmen @entity67 called for a public apology from sheriff @entity70 ' the issue here is not the nature of the relationship but the location , ' ms @entity56 said			0
' these are not bars			0
' however , according to district attorney @entity82 , since the law was struck down by the @entity21 @entity20 in 2003 there would be no way of prosecuting any of the men charged with the crime			1
' for the @entity86 to be setting up these kinds of sting operations up is a waste of time because they ca n't prosecute these things , ' said @entity92 who is defending one of the men arrested last month under the archaic law			1
advocates in the gay rights community expressed their outrage over the series of sting operations			1
' it is frustrating that people are using their resources to pursue issues like this and arrest people for attempting to pick someone up and go home with them , ' said @entity110 of @entity111			0
' it 's perfectly legal , and we would have to close down every bar in @entity8 if that were n't the case			0
' civil rights attorney @entity117 also found the operation unsettling			0
' it 's really unfortunate that police are continuing to single out , target , falsely arrest and essentially ruin the lives of gay men in @entity8 who are engaged in no illegal conduct , ' ms @entity117 said			2
metro councilman @entity67 called for an apology from sheriff @entity70 to the men arrested in the operations and the rest of the parish			2
the @entity86 seemed to partially apologize for the arrests , issuing a statement to @entity10 sunday saying they ' should have taken a different approach ' when dealing with inappropriate behaviour in the park .			0
