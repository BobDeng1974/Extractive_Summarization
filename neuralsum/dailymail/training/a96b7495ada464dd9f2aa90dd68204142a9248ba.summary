@entity0 went without sex for an entire year after his housemate bet him $ 2000 he could n't a @entity4 man who gave up sex for a year gained much more than he bargained for when a bet with a friend took on a life of its own			1
in late 2012 @entity0 joked with his housemate he was fed up with the single life , which revolved around late nights partying and one night stands			2
' i was going to give up women and sex ... he ( my housemate ) said i could n't even go a week , then this got me wound up even more , ' mr @entity0 told the @entity15			1
from there what started as a $ 2000 bet between the pair grew to more than $ 50,000 being raised over the course of the year after a @entity22 post ' went nuts ' and @entity24 's @entity23 was born			1
' i had a flash of inspiration that i could give that money to the charity , make it bigger than me , ' he said			1
the rules were for an entire year from the 1st of january 2013 , mr @entity0 , 33 at the time , was n't allowed to jump into bed with anyone at all , though kissing was passable			2
he pledged to give all funds raised to @entity36 charity @entity35 to @entity37 , an organisation which aims to save young @entity40 girls from the sex trade and instead educate them , and described the whole experience as ' a roller - coaster emotionally			1
' however an early lapse meant he came very close to breaking the ban in the first few months , and admitted the woman he was with was the one who had to put on the brakes			0
the @entity4 man set up a @entity22 page called @entity24 's @entity23 and raised more than $ 50k for a charity that supports children in @entity40 ' no one thought i could do it ... i nearly came really close to breaking it , i started seeing a girl and i do n't know why , ' he revealed			1
' i think she was just enjoying the fact i was n't trying to get in her pants			0
' ' that was a turning point , i just said i really had to take it seriously			0
' mr @entity0 described the following months as a real journey of self - discovery , and along the way he found there were many parts of himself he was n't entirely happy with			1
he focused his energy into other aspects of his life , started his own business and took a trip to @entity40 in september to see where the money raised from his abstinence was going			2
in september of last year he travelled overseas to work with the kids and see where the money was going with his help the charity was able to employ extra workers on the ground and double the amount of girls it looked after			2
' once i 'd seen what was happening , it was really humbling , ' mr @entity0 said			0
from here , he has aspirations to start a charity of his own , but for now has thrown his support behind @entity90 project , a joint effort with the father @entity92 with promotes anti-slavery and rehabilitation programs in @entity95			0
earlier this year he made the trip to @entity99 , and has just launched a fundraiser to deck out these kids , many of whom are orphans previously living on the streets , in brand new soccer gear			0
he has plans to start a charity of his own , and although would never give up sex for that long again wants to do something equally as ' crazy ' when asked if he would ever go without sex for so long again , mr @entity0 said he would be open to be doing something similar , but struggled to name something more difficult to give up			1
' i do n't think i would do no sex again for a year , i would like to something else crazy and out there and different			0
' ' if anyone can think of anything else crazy or quirky , i 'm open to suggestions			0
