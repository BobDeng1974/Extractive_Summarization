@entity1 died peacefully while sitting up in bed at the world - famous @entity3 and reading a book , it emerged last night			1
the 87 - year - old former prime minister suffered a stroke at 11.28am on monday while reading in a top suite at the five - star @entity9 in central @entity11 , where she had been staying since @entity13			1
her body was removed from the hotel , where suites cost up to £ 3,660 a night , by private ambulance almost 13 hours later at 12.20am yesterday , and her funeral was scheduled for next wednesday			1
the body was driven away with three undertakers in the front and escorted by four diplomatic protection officers on motorbikes			2
a @entity33 4x4 followed with two men in the front and blacked - out windows behind			2
security was heightened with more than a dozen police officers surrounding the hotel as the vehicle pulled away			0
a police helicopter circled in the sky above			0
the ambulance drove through the wrought iron gates at the rear of the hotel , which had been closely guarded since news of her death broke			1
in the late period of her life she had the occasional lunch at the @entity3 , where staff always knew to serve chicken consomme and a main course of lemon sole			2
police presence : the @entity9 had been closely guarded since news of @entity1 's death broke she was also sighted on a park bench in @entity11 enjoying the sunshine in march last year with her carer @entity63			1
gone were her high heels , replaced by comfortable sandals and a walking stick			0
was @entity69 's greatest peacetime prime minister ? was @entity69 's greatest peacetime prime minister ? now share your opinion then , at @entity13 , she went to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder			1
when she came out she was very uncertain on her feet , and a return home was out of the question			0
so she moved quietly into a suite at the @entity3 – one of her favourite places – and she was invited by its owners the @entity86 brothers to stay there for the foreseeable future			1
her two carers took it in turns to stay with her and the same group of friends who took it in turns to see her at her @entity97 home were put on a rota at the @entity3			1
preparations for the ceremonial funeral - due to take place at @entity102 in central @entity11 with full military honours - were underway as mps began planning tributes to her in @entity106			1
scene : @entity1 died in a suite at the five - star @entity9 in central @entity11 , where she had been staying meanwhile , the @entity110 and the @entity111 will also attend the service at @entity102 - the first political funeral @entity69 's monarch has attended personally since @entity115 's in 1965			1
iron lady : @entity1 ( pictured in 2010 ) died on monday aged 87 at the @entity3 in central @entity11 @entity1 's family was expected to gather in @entity11 yesterday , with her son @entity22 due to fly in from @entity119 last night and his twin @entity24 also now believed to be in the country			1
mps are being recalled from @entity124 recess today to let them pay tribute to her			0
the @entity126 has also been recalled and will sit at 2.30pm - the same time as the @entity127			0
but as tributes poured in for our first and only woman prime minister , many on the @entity129 condemned the social impacts of her policies encouraging the free market and stripping power from unions			0
on monday night , hundreds of people held parties to ‘ celebrate ’ her death in @entity141 and @entity142 , south @entity11			2
but today the government will put down a motion expected to pay tribute to her			0
prime minister @entity147 is expected to give a statement to the @entity127 , followed by @entity150 leader @entity149			0
there will also be time for backbench mps to make their own tributes to her			0
as @entity1 ’s health deteriorated , the issue of whether she should be granted a state funeral - as @entity115 was - grew increasingly controversial			1
however , it has emerged that she rejected the idea herself , and also insisted she did not want her body to lie in state or money to be spent on a fly - past			2
instead , the streets will be cleared for a procession from @entity167 to @entity102 ’s , where there will be a televised service attended by dignitaries from around the world			0
@entity172 & @entity173 : how to make your voice heard if you believe @entity1 deserves a state funeral , and want the government to know , sign this online petition and submit it to us			2
we will pass it to the prime minister 's office at 10 @entity183			0
