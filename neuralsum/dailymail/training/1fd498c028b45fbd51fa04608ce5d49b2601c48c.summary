if you have woken up from a vivid dream , only to forget what it was about , you might want a dream recorder			0
while such a consumer device may be years away , researchers have created a system that uses a biosensor headset to edit moving images shown on a screen according to changes in an individual 's brain activity			1
the film that ’s created is a visual record of a wearer ’s subconscious mind , giving them a glimpse into the dream world			1
day dreaming : researchers have created a gadget that uses a biosensor headset ( pictured ) to edit moving images according to changes in an individual 's brain activity to produce a dream - like film @entity30 - based animator @entity29 came up with the idea for the # scanners cinema experience , which allows everyone to watch a film differently			1
in its initial format , his setup allows a single user to manipulate a digital art installation			1
‘ narratives and layers can be built that are all governed by the user 's concentration and meditation levels			0
edit points can be created by monitoring the users blinking			1
‘ the audience can project their feelings onto the film that they are seeing , the film they watch will have a series of overlapping structures that they can interact with and / or disregard , ’ he wrote on @entity48 , which he used to raise funds for the project			0
viewers will watch a film wearing a headset that reads their brainwaves , and they will all see a different film			1
this is because images will be edited by their subconscious thoughts			0
a still taken from a test screening of a surreal film is pictured all viewers will watch a film wearing a headset that can read their brainwaves			1
the headset will let them manipulate the images they see , according to their subconscious mind			1
in this way , the narrative can be changed and ' edit points ' created when they blink			0
every viewer will see the film differently			0
the system 's creator said it will give people a glimpse into the dream world , because the film they see will be a visual record of their subconscious mind			1
‘ the goal of the project is for people to be able to physically see and hear their dreams , ’ he explained			2
‘ we tested the device at @entity98 last year and a lot of people who used it compared the experience to lucid dreaming			2
’ the technique relies on the @entity104 - a headset developed by tech company @entity106 , which costs £ 100 ( $ 159 )			1
in trials , volunteers were asked to wear the headset and watch a short film			0
mr @entity29 said : ‘ the rhythms of the editing , how the movie jumps from scene to scene , depends on the mind state of the person watching it			2
‘ much like a dream you ca n’t really control what happens on screen			0
' your brain chooses the sounds and sights you experience but you ca n’t really direct them - you just have to go with it			0
’ he was inspired to come up with the project after reading @entity130 ’s book in the @entity131 , which compares dreams to films			2
he said : ‘ films and dreams are very similar			0
the technique - which could one day pave the way for a dream machine for consumers - relies on the @entity104 - a headset developed by tech company @entity106 , which costs £ 100 ( $ 159 ) ( pictured ) the goal of the project is for people to be able to physically see and hear their dreams			1
here , a subject watched a film wearing the headset			0
its creator , @entity29 said : ‘ much like a dream you ca n’t really control what happens on screen			0
your brain chooses the sounds and sights you experience but you ca n’t direct them ' ' the problem is it ’s easy to remember a film because you ’re conscious while it ’s playing , but it can be hard to recall a dream once you ’re awake			2
‘ the headset is the perfect device for exploring dreams , because it brings your subconscious to the forefront , placing it on a screen for you to experience consciously			1
’ mr @entity29 predicts that scientific advances may make detailed dream recording possible in the near future			0
‘ there is research which suggests we may be able to fully record a dream within the next 10 to 15 years , ’ he said .			2

cinema experience has been created that edits films according to people 's brainwaves so that everyone sees a different version
