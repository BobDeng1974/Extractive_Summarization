@entity1 staff have been accused of severely mistreating sheep used in its laboratories after undercover video footage emerged from the facility			1
the university is now investigating the claims that the sheep , which are used for medical research , experienced distressing levels of mistreatment and suffering			0
several incidents have allegedly been caught on camera , including footage which show staff losing patience with an animal during a weigh in , and the sheep suffering a broken leg			1
the sheep kept at @entity1 's facilities are imported from @entity37 and are given brain implants before they undergo behavioural tests and are monitored as their condition deteriorate , the report says			1
the sheep were left disorientated , struggling to walk and losing their sight before they died or were put to sleep , according to the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , which conducted the undercover investigation			1
their footage also expose a number of incidents that were said to have increased the misery still further , including one animal suffering a broken leg after an impatient staff member tried to force her into a cage for weighing			1
the sheep had to be put down after the incident			0
undercover : the sheep 's situation was filmed by the @entity45 , and the university is now investigating the animal welfare organisation 's claims ' mistreated ' : some of the sheep are given brain implants before they undergo behavioural tests and are monitored as their condition deteriorate another sheep named @entity69 had to be killed because she had a faulty implant , while a third animal , @entity72 , suffered severe weight loss and became virtually blind			1
she was allegedly left in this state for several days , lying in her own faeces , before being euthanized			0
the purpose of the experiments was to investigate the early stages of @entity79 and @entity80 , two serious neurological conditions for which there is no cure			0
animal research is regulated by the @entity85 , which applies rules intended to ensure that it is only carried out when necessary and suffering is kept to a minimum			0
dr @entity90 , the @entity45 ’s head of science , said : ‘ it is clear from our investigation that these poor animals suffered a great deal and , we believe , unnecessarily			0
' this shows why undercover investigations are essential to reveal the extent of cruelty and suffering animals endure in @entity102 research laboratories , often for trivial purposes or highly speculative science			1
' accusations : several incidents allegedly saw maltreatment of the animals , including sheep suffering broken legs , or other injuries as a result of the implants and having to be put down dr @entity90 added : ‘ there are serious questions about whether the research has any realistic prospect of advancing the search for cures for these diseases and about the way in which the @entity85 has applied the harm / benefit test required under @entity102 legislation before allowing such research to go ahead			2
’ a statement from @entity1 said sheep were used in the studies because they had ‘ complex brains ’ similar in size to a large monkey ’s , and no alternative existed			2
the statement added : ‘ the researchers have been testing a sheep model of @entity80 developed by collaborators in @entity37 and @entity136 and studying a line of sheep that carries a natural mutation for @entity79			0
‘ whilst every attempt is made to keep distress to a minimum , the very nature of these diseases means that the animals will show symptoms related to damage of the nervous system similar to those seen in humans			2
‘ we take the allegations of mistreatment of animals very seriously and will take all appropriate actions necessary to investigate this matter in accordance with the university ’s responsibilities under our @entity85 licence and our own @entity161			0

sheep were used to study neurological disorders at @entity1
undercover footage show sheep at the lab ' in distress and suffering '
experiments left the animals struggling to walk and losing their sight
one alleged incident saw an animal break a leg due to impatient staff
