by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 20 september 2013 a @entity2 artist has fashioned a human skull out of cocaine by moulding the street - sourced class a drug mixed with gelatin			1
the piece , entitled @entity8 , is the work of mysterious artist @entity10 who says he was commissioned to make the artwork , although is prohibited from disclosing further details			1
@entity10 says he did not personally test the cocaine but employed a laboratory to analyse the drug bought from a street dealer			2
they found it was between 15 per cent to 20 per cent pure and had been cut with caffeine , paracetamol and sugar			1
heads up : the life - like sculpture is claimed to be moulded using a street - sourced class - a drug mystery : the artist who created the unusual sculpture refuses to say who commissioned it binding agreement : gelatin was used to bind the drug powder together @entity8 is a comment on the juxtaposition of man 's animal instincts versus the relatively comfortable modern world we live in			2
@entity10 , 36 , explains : ' @entity8 is not intended to be parable on the self - destructiveness of addiction or substance abuse			2
instead , it 's the focal point for a thought process			0
' i do n't want to over-intellectualise , but it 's the fusion of two icons ( skull and cocaine ) that provokes thought and discussion on the nature of man			0
specifically , about his creation of , and participation in , a society which echoes his own tendency to lose control			0
concept : the artist describes his work as the fusion of two icons - a skull and cocaine off his head ? @entity10 hopes his work becomes a focal point for discussion on the nature of man @entity10 claims his artwork confronts the notion that man has created a society that 's out of control ' we have temporarily outgrown the intended uses for our animal instincts			1
this leaves us in an uncomfortable conundrum			0
where can we safely store them until we need them again ? ' @entity10 studied @entity81 at the @entity82 , @entity83 and acquired a @entity84 in @entity85 from the @entity86 , @entity87 in 2001 .			0
