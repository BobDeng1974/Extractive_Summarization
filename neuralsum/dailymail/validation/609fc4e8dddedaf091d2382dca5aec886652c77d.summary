@entity1 supporters have taken to social media to boast about the recruitment of a failed party loving rapper from @entity6			1
@entity7 , better known by his stage name @entity9 , announced his decision to join @entity11 by posting a picture of himself holding a goat , allegedly in @entity15			1
@entity9 appears to have abandoned his trademark ushanka hat and is shown wearing a long red and white @entity18 scarf			1
@entity9 was one of a dozen @entity6 rappers who were vocal critics of president @entity27 @entity26 's regime			1
previously the 25 year old used his social media page to proudly show off photos of himself surrounded with a bevy of scantily clad ladies			1
one of the photos shows the rapper being touched and stroked by a group of women , with one of them appears to be drinking from a suspicious looking wine glass			1
@entity9 is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers have joined @entity11 over the last few years			1
@entity53 rapper @entity52 is the best known of the three known rappers to have been part of @entity1 radical : known on stage as @entity58 , the wannabe gangster ( left ) traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group 's radical brand of @entity62 rapping jihadis : @entity9 is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers - including @entity53 's @entity66 ( left ) and @entity68 's @entity67 ( right ) have joined @entity11 in recent years @entity53 rapper @entity52 is the best known of the three known rappers to have been part of @entity1			1
known on stage as @entity58 , the wannabe gangster traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group 's radical brand of @entity62			2
@entity68 failed rapper @entity67 was reportedly killed fighting for @entity11 last august			2
@entity67 , who enjoyed smoking marijuana in the park and had previous convictions for disorderly conduct , is thought to have converted to @entity62 in 2004			2
after travelling to @entity76 , @entity67 crossed the border and entered @entity78 sometime in june 2014			2
the 33 - year - old was killed whilst fighting against the @entity80 in late august his body was identified by his distinctive neck tattoo , a hallmark of his wilder days in @entity84			2
@entity6 has long been a hot - bed of would be jihadist sympathetic to the @entity11 cause , with an estimated 3,000 people fighting in @entity78 – the highest number of any country			2
the north @entity91 country has always been a breeding ground for terrorists , with extremists advantage of bored and jobless young men looking for an escape route			0
but the recent surge in numbers seems to be down to the hard - line groups which have taken advantage of the relaxing laws following the @entity102 in 2011 - including @entity104 militant group @entity103 , which the @entity68 brands as a terrorist organisation and blames for a 2012 attack on the @entity68 embassy in @entity109			1
the government also released a number of fundamentalists from prison – allowing them to mix freely with the population once more			0
these groups have taken advantage of the declining economy , capitalising on the disappointment felt by those who expected a change after the @entity121 , according to @entity122 , a lawyer who represents returning jihadists			0
‘ the @entity18 revolutions raised an expectation that was n't met – people thought their lives would improve , but instead they got worse , ” mr @entity122 told @entity124			0
‘ in @entity78 , they are told they ’ll get houses , they ’ll get wives			0
these people are so alienated from our society that some choose this option in a heartbeat			0
’ social media is also blamed , with pictures of @entity11 fighters getting thousands of likes and recruiters using @entity142 to find any potential fighters , much like is seen in the @entity144			1
but with the rise of @entity11 in @entity147 , to the east , and @entity150 affiliated groups in @entity151 , to the west , it is now easy to join a ‘ jihad ’ , and get arms into @entity6 itself			0
‘ @entity6 is surrounded by jihadist groups in the mountains who coordinate with the terrorists in @entity147 ... @entity147 is the main source of arms for jihadists in @entity6 , ’ said prime minister @entity156			0
but despite this , @entity6 is seen as the success story of the @entity121 , and tourist numbers have been on the increase once more as people begin to feel the area is safe once more			0
in 2013 , 6.27million people visited @entity6			0
of those , almost 330,000 were @entity144 , while 985,000 were @entity172 .			0
