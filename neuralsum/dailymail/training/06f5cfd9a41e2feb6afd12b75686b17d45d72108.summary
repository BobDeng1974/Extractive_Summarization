welcome to just a minute by @entity0 back in the summer , i made my own wireless debut — @entity4			1
i also made the mistake of telling everyone what an absolute piece of cake jabbering on the radio was			1
writing is what ’s hard — facing the blank sheet every morning			2
i was reminded of all this when leafing through @entity0 ’ ‘ celebration of @entity24 ’s best - loved radio comedy ’ , @entity23 — because what is that programme , after all , other than the requirement to talk drivel for up to 60 seconds on , say , ‘ finding a caterpillar in my salad ’			1
to date there have been 900 editions			2
@entity27 has long been the chairman , and he has a genius for keeping control over the teams , who can get quite temperamental			2
he was defeated only by @entity33 , who was persistently crotchety and guilty of ‘ poisoning the atmosphere and inhibiting the audience ’			2
indeed , @entity36 refused to go on the show if @entity33 was hired			2
@entity38 in his glory days as a star of the carry on films , pictured here in @entity44 with @entity45 ( left ) and with @entity0 ( right ) nevertheless , there is something ineffably @entity48 about the whole radio panel game genre that i find faintly depressing			1
like many a quiz programme , it is redolent of jigsaws on wet afternoons , flickering coal fires , tinned peaches for tea , dull journeys in the car			2
it is genial and happily mindless , with , under the surface , considerable competitiveness and animosity			0
@entity38 was more or less demented when put behind a microphone			1
bombastic and impatient , he shrieked his way through 344 episodes			1
@entity27 gives us a moving and perceptive account of @entity38 ’ contributions — and touches on something far darker , which is the notion that the great carry on star committed suicide because he felt trapped in a panel game hell			1
@entity38 shrieked his way through 344 episodes of the show @entity38 had worked with @entity77 and @entity78 , so in doing all this wireless work he felt he ’d wasted his life ‘ making a noise that floats up into the air and disappears ’			1
it makes alarming reading now , seeing his comments and interjections in cold print and realising that @entity38 was making comic capital out of a genuine despair			1
though it was mock outrage , it was real at some level : ‘ oh , i ’m so bored ! ’ ‘ i do n’t care ! shut your row ! ’ , etc. @entity27 refers to @entity38 ’ ‘ precarious ego ’ and says he ‘ performed wonderfully , in a mad , anarchic manner ’ , but if we compare the quotations in this book with the screams and howls found in his diaries and letters , what listeners heard was a man teetering on the edge of an abyss like a porcelain cup about to drop off the shelf			1
@entity113 , fondly remembered by @entity27 , was a panellist of long standing			0
though born in @entity115 and raised in a caravan , @entity113 re-invented himself as an affable toff — a sort of sexless @entity119 — who played stammering comedy vicars in sitcoms and at @entity124 parties had his drinks served in a silver chalice by a personal butler			0
having worked with @entity77 and @entity78 ( pictured ) , in doing all this wireless work he felt @entity38 felt he had wasted his life @entity113 has been reincarnated , and replaced on the show , by the versatile good egg @entity131			1
@entity132 can talk about ‘ the things in my wallet ’ until the cows come home			0
indeed , he holds the @entity137 for making a 12 - hour non-stop speech			0
he wore a surgical appliance so that he could urinate at the podium			0
i was fascinated to be told in this book that ‘ the @entity143 has one ’			0
keep that in mind when you next see him taking the salute			0
just @entity149 began in 1967 , when the @entity124 policy was you could n’t make jokes about lavatories or effeminacy in men			0
now they do nothing else			0
@entity27 grasped that ‘ the point and fun of the game comes out of those challenges and not from a brilliant exposition of one minute ’			1
true — but it rather dooms this book , because the atmosphere of the programme can not be captured or evoked on the page			0
the show is ‘ instantaneous comedy ’ , with no scripts or re-takes			0
‘ you hear what happened ’ — and in truth very little merits preservation , save the late @entity176 ’s description of plastic surgery addict @entity177 as ‘ a siamese cat walking into a gale ’ .			0

@entity38 was more or less demented when put behind a microphone
bombastic and impatient , he shrieked his way through 344 episodes
*author* @entity0 suggests that the great carry on star committed suicide because he felt trapped in a panel game hell
@entity38 had worked with @entity77 and @entity78 , so in doing all this wireless work he felt he ’d wasted his life
