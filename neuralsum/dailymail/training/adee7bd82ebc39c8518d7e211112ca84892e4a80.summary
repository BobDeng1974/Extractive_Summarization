by @entity1 reporter published : 09:13 est , 19 august 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 19 august 2012 as he begged outside @entity4 synagogues , @entity2 was always regaling people with stories of his past , proudly referring to his distant esteemed rabbi relatives			1
but suddenly @entity2 's tales took a much more sinister turn – he told friends - and anyone who 'd listen - that someone was out to kill him and that he urgently needed thousands of dollars			1
he even started saying his farewells to friends			0
@entity19 was the proud owner of a vast collection of vintage photos with an estimated value of $ 1 million however , as he was always a bit strange , people simply dismissed his frantic behaviour and wild tales			1
' he ’d say that someone is out to kill him			0
he said he needed $ 17,000 right away , ' a friend , @entity30 , told the @entity31			2
on june 28 , @entity2 was discovered floating face down in @entity4 's @entity33			1
the @entity34 said 55 - year - old ’s death was not a homicide and began investigating it as a suicide or an accident			2
already shrouded in mystery , @entity2 's death became all the more mysterious as it turned out that the beggar was sitting on a vast collection of entertainment photographs - worth an estimated $ 1 million			1
bizarre : @entity19 started telling friends and family that he someone was out to kill him and he owed them thousands of dollars			1
@entity19 was found floating face down in a @entity4 canal on june 28 ; @entity34 began investigating his death as a suicide or accident collected over his lifetime , the photos were of tv and film stars from the 1950s to the 1990s			1
the eccentric beggar would reportedly rather buy photos than food and it is thought his collection reached 1 million			1
his pictures of comedienne @entity64 - his favourites and the most valuable - alone numbered tens of thousands			0
friends and family said @entity2 needed cash to pay off storage fees , as he kept his massive collection of photos in a warehouse			2
however , a friend of his - @entity73 - told the @entity31 that he had been paying the storage fees for the last five years with the agreement that when the photo collection was brought – or @entity2 died – he would be paid			1
about a week before he died , @entity2 put a lien for $ 78,000 on his photo collection to cover his storage fee debts			1
suicide ? friends and family say that @entity19 was scared of water and would not have killed himself ; he was found dead in the @entity33 on june 28 on the night of june 27 , @entity2 left the @entity85 synagogue much earlier than usual , members told @entity86			1
his business partner of recent years , @entity87 , had let the collector stay at his home			0
he said that @entity2 never made it back to the apartment that night			0
@entity87 suggested to @entity86 that @entity2 may have been killed after crossing the wrong rabbi because he was controversially sharing information about @entity4 ’s @entity95 community with others			0
@entity97 , who spoke to the @entity31 , also thinks that his brother may have angered the wrong rabbi or loan sharks in a bid to own his photos outright - free from @entity73			0
many say @entity2 would never kill himself and testify that he was terrified of water			0
investigators found that @entity2 's lungs were full of water – showing that he was still alive when he entered the canal			0
however , some of @entity2 's acquaintances believe he did kill himself – pointing out that he was forced to close his photo shop following the economic downturn after 9/11 and had to leave his apartment			0
@entity34 spokesman @entity114 told the @entity115 that there was ' no apparent criminality at this time ' in @entity2 's death			0
shelter : having lost his photo shop and his home , @entity2 's business partner - @entity87 - let him stay with him in his @entity124 apartment collection : @entity2 had about one million photos including tens of thousands of the late comedienne , @entity64 ; pictured here with her husband @entity129			2
@entity2 's vast collection was worth an estimated $ 1 million the @entity133 ’s @entity132 did not conduct an autopsy – reportedly on the family ’s orders – as autopsies are typically against @entity139 law			1
the examiner ’s office are now relying on crime - scene photographs and x-rays to try and determine the cause of death , @entity140 , an office spokeswoman told the @entity31			2
and whether @entity2 ’s death was an accident , or if he committed suicide at the prospect of losing his photos or was killed after crossing the wrong people will be all the harder to determine with no autopsy			2
' the manner of death might be undetermined if there is n’t enough evidence , ' @entity140 said			0
