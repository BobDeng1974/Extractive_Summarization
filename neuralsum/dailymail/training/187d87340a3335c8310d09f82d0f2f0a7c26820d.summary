by @entity0 published : 19:27 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 19:33 est , 23 february 2013 campaigners fear assisted suicide is being legalised by the back door as record numbers of @entity5 end their lives at @entity7 – while their relatives escape investigation for helping them			1
the @entity11 suicide clinic helped 33 people from this country to die last year – the highest ever annual figure – pushing the total during the past decade close to 250			1
but police passed only a handful of files to prosecutors over the assistance provided by loved ones , and no one was charged			1
a police worker even accompanied her mother to @entity11 but faced no sanction			1
secret : campaigners fear assisted suicide is being legalised by the back door as record numbers of @entity5 end their lives at @entity7 , pictured , while their relatives escape investigation for helping them the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) has recently issued new guidelines to every force in the country about how they should investigate assisted suicides			1
although the document is restricted , this newspaper has been shown the section that deals with deaths abroad			0
it highlights how tough such inquiries can be because of the difficulty in obtaining evidence from foreign authorities			0
but the situation has prompted claims that the police are failing to uphold the law and protect vulnerable or disabled people , who could be pressurised to commit suicide			1
@entity50 , of the campaign group @entity51 , said : ‘ the idea is gaining hold that assisting someone to commit suicide is not prosecutable in practice			1
’ @entity57 mp @entity56 , who is vice-chairman of the @entity58 , said : ‘ i fear assisted suicide is being legalised by the back door			1
if the will of @entity62 is being ignored , there should be an urgent review by the justice secretary			0
’ @entity65 , of the @entity66 , said of the police guidance : ‘ it is extremely worrying that police officers are saying they can not investigate and are advising their members not to investigate deaths abroad			2
’ aiding or encouraging a suicide remains illegal in @entity74 and @entity75 under the @entity76 and punishable by up to 14 years ’ imprisonment			2
but guidelines published in 2010 by the @entity78 spelled out that relatives would not be charged if they acted out of compassion to help a terminally ill person end their suffering			2
new figures suggest that move reassured @entity5 that they will escape punishment if they help loved ones travel to countries such as @entity11 , where assisted suicide is permitted			2
support : sir @entity89 , left , is a known supporter of assisted suicide			2
@entity90 , right , died a week after losing his legal battle for the right to end his own life @entity7 , set up in 1998 , allows foreigners to use its services , and its own figures show that 248 @entity5 have now died there – with 33 deaths last year , up from 22 the year before			1
anyone who wants the organisation ’s help must become a member , pay about £ 10,000 and see a local doctor before being given a fatal dose of barbiturates to drink			0
the @entity107 ’s statistics reveal that police passed them 44 files on assisted suicides and cases of euthanasia – where a doctor administers the fatal dose – between 2009 and 2011			1
by october 2012 , the total had reached 66 , including deaths in @entity74 and @entity75 as well as abroad			2
of these , prosecutors chose not to proceed with 45 , nine were withdrawn and 12 were still being looked into			0
in previous years , police arrested some relatives and friends after they helped terminally ill people die at @entity7			1
but those who made the trip last year said that they had not been questioned			0
the new police guidelines say ‘ there may be a lack of co-operation or even a legal impediment as to why the relevant foreign authorities can not provide evidence as to how and why someone has died ’			0
they also point out that ‘ in a substantial majority of cases , the bodies are cremated in the country in which the suicide took place			1
if the body is not repatriated to @entity74 and @entity75 , the death does not come under the jurisdiction of the @entity133 ’			0
chief constable @entity142 , @entity29 spokesman on homicide , said : ‘ it requires any @entity5 police force to be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the circumstances under which the person died , and this can be difficult , particularly if burial or cremation has already taken place			0
but whenever we receive information or intelligence about such a case , these investigations are pursued			0
’ a @entity107 spokesman said : ‘ while no prosecutions have been brought since the 2010 guidelines were issued , each case is considered on its own merits			0
any inference that the @entity107 has implemented a blanket policy of not prosecuting for this offence is wrong			0
’ meanwhile , former labour minister @entity167 will later this year table a @entity168 that would legalise assisted suicide in @entity74 and @entity75 if a patient had less than a year to live			1
@entity171 , press manager for @entity172 , said : ‘ some people will choose an assisted death even if they have to travel abroad at great financial and emotional cost to themselves and their loved ones			0
‘ so a much better alternative would be a safeguarded assisted dying law here in the @entity5			0
