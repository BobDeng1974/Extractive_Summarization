naming @entity2 's beloved @entity1 after the goddess @entity0 seemed like a good idea at the time			1
but there are claims the pet could be on her way out - after she was dogged by comparisons to the brutal wave of @entity14 violence of the same name			0
tonight 's episode raises questions for the first time over @entity0 ' health as she approaches a grand old age of between eight and ten , or 56 to 70 in dog years			1
are the dog days over ? the @entity25 's dog @entity0 ( above ) appears unwell in tonight 's episode of @entity2 @entity27 , the countess of @entity25 , is seen looking at a morose - looking pet splayed on the ground and remarks : ' she ’s terribly listless			1
i do n’t know that she has n’t picked up a germ			2
' lady @entity33 adds : ' she ’ll have eaten a dead squirrel or something equally foul '			0
@entity37 's @entity36 , the @entity25 , then chimes in and says he will have the pet looked at by a vet			2
to most it would seem like an innocuous point of conversation			0
critics and devoted fans , of course , know the @entity48 drama 's writers seldom raise a topic for no reason			2
@entity0 made her first appearance in the period drama in its second series in 2011 , replacing the earl 's previous pet @entity55			0
famous rear : the @entity1 's predecessor @entity55 makes a star appearance in the show 's opening credits as the first series tailed off in 1914 and the second began in 1916 , @entity0 - now appearing in 1924 - is likely to be between eight and ten years old , hardly immune to the ills of old age			1
the yellow @entity1 was named after the @entity67 goddess @entity0 , whose name means ' throne ' and became one of the most important deities of ancient @entity67			1
but the name prompted grim comparisons after the rise of militants branding themselves @entity76 ( @entity0 ) - also known as @entity77 and @entity76			0
one @entity2 fan account , @entity79 , tweeted : ' is there a tv dog more unfortunately named than @entity2 's @entity0 ? ' @entity82 said : ' you 're gon na have to somehow change the name of the dog , @entity2			1
not sure @entity0 is currently a world favorite			0
' faithful companion : @entity0 has been with a @entity88 for a decade after the demise of her predecessor @entity55 ( left ) , but in tonight 's episode @entity93 of @entity25 ( right ) remarks on her possible ill health @entity96 feature writer @entity95 chimed in : ' i fear that recent events in the @entity99 have rendered the name of @entity101 's dog @entity0 deeply inappropriate			1
' @entity48 has insisted the whole issue is a coincidence , adding that most of the current series was filmed before fans began pointing out the similarity in names			2
the broadcaster does not comment on future plot twists , but a spokesman said : ' @entity0 has been the @entity112 's family pet since @entity113 ( 2011 ) and was named after the @entity114			2
' @entity115 saw the family pet @entity55 , with the same themed name			0
' at the time the dog was named and up to and including the majority of filming of @entity122 , no one was using that acronym to describe a terror group			0
it is an unfortunate coincidence			0
’ many things other than the dog are named after the @entity67 goddess - including a @entity130 metal band , a range of @entity133 underwear , @entity135 's student magazine and the international student @entity136 .			1

@entity1 named after @entity67 goddess long before @entity99 militants
but recently her name began raising *eyebrows* with @entity2 fans
in tonight 's show @entity25 and @entity147 of @entity148 hint at possible demise
' she 's terribly listless . i do **n't** know that she has **n't** picked up a germ '
