by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 10:00 est , 29 november 2013 @entity1 claims we have n't seen the best of @entity4 yet , despite their resounding 5 - 0 victory over @entity8 side @entity7 this week			1
@entity1 , who will pit his team against @entity10 at @entity11 on sunday , believes @entity4 can prove their @entity13 title credentials on a more consistent basis			1
' i still think the best is still to come , ' the former @entity16 manager said			0
' i still think we can continue to improve and progress			0
impressed : but @entity1 ( right ) believes @entity4 still have more to give ' we 've had some little bits of inconsistency at times , which we need to do better with , but i think there are moments when we 're beginning to show we 're coming right back into form			1
' @entity25 certainly showed what we 're capable of when we 're playing well , and the job is to do that week - in , week - out			0
' the @entity4 boss believes his champions - in particular the lethal partnership of @entity31 and @entity32 - should be considered among the best teams in the @entity13			1
' i think we compare with anyone			0
there have been quite a few changes in strike partnerships in the @entity13 and some very good forwards , and as you 'd expect , i think we 've got a partnership to rival any of them			2
' dynamic duo : @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 have been lethal in @entity4 's attack @entity44 : @entity4 enjoyed a stunning 5 - 0 @entity46 win in @entity8 where @entity47 was on target @entity32 was instrumental in the win at the @entity50 which sealed their qualification to the @entity46 knock - out stages			1
the @entity54 forward set up four of the five goals while the visitors made a mockery of @entity7 's unbeaten home record			1
@entity59 , who turned 40 on friday , was also in fine fettle in @entity7 , impressing his manager with an elegant display in centre midfield			1
' @entity59 is undoubtedly at the top of any list of @entity13 legends , for all sorts of reasons			1
' because of his longevity , playing his entire career at a club like @entity4 , the amount of games he has played in @entity74 and the @entity13 and the fact that he has provided so many outstanding memories every single season			1
@entity79 : the victory against @entity7 was a record away victory for the club ' it is terrific to be doing it at his age , and it is an example to young players everywhere to see how far you can go with the right dedication			2
it is also an example to players in their mid- 30s , who may be wondering whether they are coming to the end of the road , to see that if you keep training well and looking after yourself , you can carry on longer			0
' when you get to his age , any decision about carrying on is left until the end of the season			0
do n't forget , he 's on the coaching staff anyway , but if he feels he wants to continue next season i 'll be more than happy with that			0
' ' there were a few surprises for him in the dressing room to mark his birthday			0
a coach 's watch was one , so maybe they are trying to send him a message ! ' birthday cheer : the chefs at @entity119 rustled up this cake to mark @entity59 ' 40th ' i think he was beginning to think they were pushing him out of the dressing - room ! ' they 're very good			1
he 's respected by everyone in the dressing - room because of what he 's done and what he 's achieved in football			2
' turning his attention to @entity4 's game in north @entity132 on sunday , as well as saying a number of injured players , including @entity31 ' have a chance ' of playing , @entity1 is expecting another thriller			1
he said : ' they are always good games			0
we will go there and try to win , as we always do			0
' during his pre-match press conference , @entity1 was pressed about potential moves in the january transfer window			2
no go ? @entity4 were linked with a move for @entity144 ( left ) for much of the summer he said @entity4 would only sign players ' if the right players are available and they fit exactly what we want			2
' he added : ' we would like to [ sign players ] , but as always there are no guarantees			0
' @entity4 chased one of @entity1 former players @entity144 for much of the summer , and the @entity156 was asked whether the @entity157 would return for the @entity16 full back in the future			1
' if they are determined to hold on to him [ @entity144 ] then he ca n't be going anywhere , ' @entity1 said			2
' so it 's worthless asking me the question			0

@entity1 claims @entity4 can improve on 5 - 0 win over @entity7
@entity4 boss says his team are among @entity13 's best
*reveals* @entity4 players ' birthday present to 40 - year - old @entity59
