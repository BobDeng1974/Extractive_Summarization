@entity59 love : when @entity6 learned she was going to have her second baby , she called her mom , then they both hopped in the car to tell her twin sister , @entity7			2

before i knew it , i was headed in to have my son , too			0
' with both sisters in labor , dr. @entity47 ended up running run back and forth between the labor rooms to deliver the baby boys			0
