president @entity2 may send ground troops into @entity4 , a senior @entity1 official said this afternoon			1
deputy national security adviser @entity5 told reporters accompanying the president on his vacation that @entity2 would consider sending in troops to help save thousands of @entity4 trapped on a mountain if that was the recommendation of 130 @entity12 and special forces sent in tuesday to access the situation			1
that action would be ' different than reintroducing @entity17 forces in a combat role to take the fight to @entity20 , ' however , @entity5 claimed , according to the @entity21 , because the troops ' sole objective would be the humanitarian rescue mission			1
' we do n’t believe it ’s sustainable to have permanent airdrops ' of food and water , he said			0
the @entity17 is sending in 130 troops to @entity4 to access the feasibility of rescuing @entity32 who remain stranded on @entity39 @entity32 refugees wait for a chance to board a helicopter sent by the @entity44 autonomous government to @entity4 's @entity39 mountains on tuesday			1
members of the religious group have been stranded on the mountain for more than a week sick @entity4 children from the @entity32 community wait for treatment at a clinic at the refugee camp in @entity35 , @entity36 @entity54 prime minister @entity53 also announced plans for an international rescue mission in @entity4 today for the refugees who are ' exposed , starving and dying of thirst ' on the mountain			2
@entity53 flew back from a vacation to @entity61 a half a day early to participate in an emergency meeting about the crisis , saying afterward his country would ' play a role ' in relief efforts			0
the @entity54 leader said ' detailed plans are now being put in place ’ for the mission but declined to share them with reporters			0
another 130 @entity17 troops arrived in @entity4 on tuesday on what the @entity75 described as a temporary mission to assess the scope of the humanitarian crisis facing thousands of displaced @entity4 civilians trapped on @entity39 and evaluate options for getting them out to safety			1
' this is not a combat boots on the ground kind of operation , ' defense secretary @entity83 said in announcing the deployment yesterday in remarks to @entity12 at a @entity91 base			1
' we 're not going back into @entity4 in any of the same combat mission dimensions that we once were in in @entity4 , ' he added , referring to the eight - year war that cost more than 4,400 @entity17 lives and soured the @entity17 public on military involvement in @entity4			2
another defense official , speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional details on the sensitive mission , told the @entity103 the extra troops were @entity12 and special operations forces whose mission was to assess the situation in the @entity39 area and to develop additional humanitarian assistance options beyond current @entity17 efforts there			1
a separate official told @entity103 the mission for the130 troops could last less than one week			2
that official also said that while the troops were not being sent in to execute some type of rescue mission of the @entity32 on the mountain , they would assess the feasibility of a rescue or what one might look like			2
they would also assist in the ongoing effort to evaluate the use of airstrikes as part of the mission to protect the @entity32 from attacks by the @entity131 militants			0
@entity132 referred to the 130 as ' assessors			0
' the additional troops arrived tuesday in the city of @entity136 , well east of @entity39			2
they were to work with representatives of the @entity138 and the @entity139 to coordinate plans with international partners and non-government organizations to help the trapped @entity32 civilians on @entity39			0
' they will make a very rapid and critical assessment because we understand it 's urgent to try to move those people off the mountain , ' secretary of state @entity144 told reporters traveling with him in @entity153 , @entity154			0
the move shows the @entity2 administration is weighing the impact and implications of several days of targeted airstrikes on the @entity131 fighters and how that has affected @entity17 - backed @entity44 forces opposing them in northern @entity4			1
secretary of defense @entity83 addresses the @entity12 assembled in a hangar at @entity164 on tuesday			0
@entity132 announced the @entity4 deployment in his remarks at this @entity91 base one immediate dilemma was the fate of thousands of displaced @entity32 in the @entity39 area who have been provided with food and water delivered by @entity17 cargo planes in recent days			0
@entity175 also was considering how to increase its military assistance to the @entity44 , whose militia is outgunned by the militants			0
the 130 were in addition to 90 @entity17 military advisers already in @entity181 and 160 in a pair of operations centers — one in @entity136 and one in @entity181 — working with @entity4 security forces			1
they were in addition to about 455 @entity17 security forces and 100 military personnel working in the @entity190 in the @entity191 in @entity181			2
@entity17 officials said that while @entity2 put caps on the number of troops deployed to @entity4 , these latest forces were being sent under the authorization for humanitarian assistance and therefore did not exceed the limits			1
' this is not a combat boots on the ground kind of operation , ' @entity132 told them secretary of defense @entity83 , left , shakes hands with @entity12 after bringing them up to date on the situation in @entity4 and @entity208			1
the @entity75 official said the 130 troops deployed to @entity4 were ' assessors , ' not combat troops @entity132 takes a question from gunnery sgt. @entity214 during a question and answer period with @entity12 president @entity2 has said repeatedly he will not send ground combat forces back into @entity4			1
but @entity2 's assurances have done little to quell the concerns of @entity220 who worry that repeated deployments of @entity17 forces will result in mission creep			1
' i oppose open - ended military commitments , which the president ’s actions in @entity4 could become , ' sen. @entity225 told @entity230 last friday			0
' i am deeply concerned that these actions could lead to prolonged direct military involvement , which i would strongly oppose , ' he said			0
@entity233 , a former @entity75 official under @entity2 who now serves as a senior fellow at the @entity235 , told the @entity236 that even a rescue mission like the one the administration is currently mulling could end up landing the @entity17 back in @entity4 militarily			1
' this to me represents a dramatic escalation , and i think it deserves a little bit of thought to avoid exactly a @entity245 down situation , where you think you 're there for humanitarian reasons and suddenly you 're there for a civil war , ' he said			0
on saturday president @entity2 admitted that he had no timeline for the @entity17 to cease its operations in @entity4			2
' i ’m not going to give a particular timetable , because as i ’ve said from the start , wherever and whenever @entity17 personnel and facilities are threatened , it ’s my obligation , my responsibility as commander - in - chief , to make sure that they are protected , ' he said .			0

the @entity75 *insisted* yesterday that new troops were ' assessors ' and this is not a ' combat boots on the ground kind of operation '
but @entity1 deputy national security adviser @entity5 told reporters this afternoon that @entity2 could send in ground troops
130 @entity12 and special forces were sent in to @entity136 on tuesday to ' assess the situation '
that action would be ' different than reintroducing @entity17 forces in a combat role to take the fight to @entity20 , ' @entity5 claimed
the troops ' sole objective would be the humanitarian rescue mission , the @entity2 administration official said
@entity220 worry that military action in @entity4 will result in mission creep
