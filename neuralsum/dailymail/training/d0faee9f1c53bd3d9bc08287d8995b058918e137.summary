the @entity0 was forced to admit yesterday that it had lost track of hundreds of dangerous foreign criminals awaiting deportation			1
instead of being locked up until they are thrown out of the @entity5 , 758 offenders from overseas , including murderers , rapists , robbers and paedophiles , have vanished after being let out of prison			1
for the first time , the @entity12 can reveal the crimes committed by those who have absconded after completing their sentences – meaning they could still pose a serious threat			0
there are 4,247 overseas criminals living in @entity5 due for deportation and among the 758 – or one in six – who have gone missing are ‘ high harm ’ individuals at risk of committing the gravest crimes			1
in a snapshot of those let out of prison by march last year , those who had absconded included up to 12 killers , 11 rapists , 46 violent thugs , 152 drug dealers , 33 robbers and 23 other sex offenders			1
at least 115 had been jailed for at least four years – an indication of the seriousness of their crimes			0
the figures were obtained from the @entity0 by the @entity40 ’ @entity41 after ministers previously refused to publish them			1
foreign criminals who commit serious offences are automatically considered for deportation , but once offenders are released from jail they are rarely put on a plane home			1
they can only be placed in a detention centre if there are realistic prospects they will be removed swiftly because judges would otherwise order them to be released			0
it means that thousands of criminals are placed back in the community with a request to keep in touch with immigration officials			2
but many simply slip off the radar			0
@entity62 , of the @entity64 think - tank , said : ‘ it is a disgrace that on top of letting the wrong people into the country , we can not even reliably get rid of them at the end of their sentences			0
there are 4,247 overseas criminals living in @entity5 due for deportation and among the 758 – or one in six – who have gone missing are ‘ high harm ’ individuals ( file pic ) ‘ we need a simple process for ensuring all foreign criminals are deported at the end of their sentences			1
' we also must look at controlling our borders better so that those who come here are not likely to commit crimes in the first place			0
’ lord @entity86 , chairman of @entity87 , said : ‘ it is shocking that so many serious offenders should have been able to abscond			0
' we need to change the law so that it permits serious criminals to be detained until arrangements can be made to deport them , however long that takes			2
’ there are hopes the deportation process can be speeded up			2
the @entity12 reported yesterday how judges have backed the new ‘ deport first , appeal later ’ regime that means criminals can be kicked out , forcing them to fight appeals in their home country .			0
