by @entity0 with their sweeping floor - length gowns and high necklines , the stars on the @entity3 ’ red carpet appeared surprisingly demure			1
but only until they turned around ... for the most fashionable look this year was a blast of bare back			1
and it worked wonders for those who exhibited it , from @entity14 stars @entity15 and @entity16 to big @entity18 names like @entity19			1
both were wearing gowns that cut away from their shoulders , right down to the base of their spine			2
their eye - catching expanse of bare skin saw both hailed as among the best - dressed stars , while @entity42 — modest @entity43 in the series — showed off an extremely toned physique			1
@entity47 tv presenter @entity46 went for a striking pink and white dress with a deep v of back cleavage , finished off with a bow			2
@entity53 , known for her roles in @entity55 and @entity56 , wore a scarlet strapless dress that fell away at the back to show off her perfectly clear , smooth skin			0
all white on the night : @entity62 star @entity61 in a strapless white @entity64 gown ( left ) and in the pink is @entity47 tv presenter @entity46 making her entrance at the 66th @entity68 ( right ) and ms @entity69 managed the night ’s most demure back display in a stunning red dress with a lace panel			1
but while the stars may make this style look easy , flashing some back is surprisingly difficult to do well			1
for while breasts can be lifted , tummies tucked and legs improved by soaring stilettos , the back is far harder to artificially enhance			0
for mere mortals , there is the risk of love handles , back fat and even acne			0
only exceptional skin will work , matched by perfectly honed arms			0
so little wonder that stars want to show off their smooth , tanned and perfectly toned backs when it is such a coveted asset			2
most of them even put their hair up to give a clear view			0
ladies in red : @entity53 ( left ) wore a full - skirted @entity98 gown , @entity19 ( centre ) chose @entity100 , and @entity101 swathed @entity103 's curves as all three dazzled in scarlet but the trickiest part of the backless look is actually the front			1
for only those with a pert bust can get away with going bra-less — which is what these dresses demand			2
ms @entity53 benefited from structure built into the bodice , which lifted her bust without the need for a bra			0
she and ms @entity69 also worked the other major trend of the night : bright red			2
as did @entity120 , whose voluptuous curves reminded fashionistas that a revealing front can be just as striking as any back			0
@entity125 chose to stand out from the crowd in a short bejewelled skirt			0
her peplum jacket and skirt neatly demonstrated that , at 46 , she has no need to hide her famous legs away			0
you 're a little shiny darling : actor @entity133 is spruced up by @entity135 's @entity134 on the red carpet crowd - pleaser : @entity125 shows off her famous legs in an @entity139 two - piece ( left ) and the winners ( right )			1
