dramatically cleared of killing his new wife on their honeymoon four years ago , @entity0 will today fly home to @entity5 on a private aircraft chartered by his wealthy family			1
but the one thing he has craved all his life – respectability – will prove elusive now			0
for his secret gay double life , particularly his penchant for violent sex with rubber - clad male prostitutes , will now face renewed scrutiny as his dead bride ’s family plot legal action over his sordid private life			1
‘ which father in the world , including me , would allow their daughter to marry a person who sleeps with men ? ’ he said			0
‘ the whole wedding was a drama and was false			2
‘ i am going to sue him for that – not just for the money , but for the loss of my daughter			2
’ the family believe they have grounds for suing @entity0 for leading @entity28 into marriage without revealing his sexuality , and for compensation for the money the @entity27 family spent on the three - day , £ 200,000 wedding			1
they are furious , as are prosecution lawyers , that the issue of @entity0 ’s sexuality was dismissed as irrelevant by the judge at the start of the trial on the grounds that this was not in dispute , leaving the prosecution without a motive to prove murder			1
legal action : @entity27 , the father of @entity0 ’s murdered bride @entity28 , has retained a @entity30 legal firm to sue his son - in - law for keeping secret the fact that he was gay anger : @entity28 's family believe they have grounds for suing @entity0 for leading @entity28 into marriage without revealing his sexuality			1
pictured are her sister @entity82 , brother @entity83 and father @entity84 yet , until the case began , @entity0 had always vehemently denied rumours that he was a promiscuous homosexual , and had spared no expense to keep the truth out of the public domain			1
having hired @entity90 , the disgraced publicist , on a retainer of £ 30,000 a month within days of being named as a suspect for the murder in 2010 , @entity0 ordered @entity90 to suppress details of his homosexual double life			1
after the @entity96 contacted @entity90 over allegations that @entity0 had hired rent boys , the publicist — now serving eight years in prison for sexual assaults — insisted there was ‘ no truth at all ’ in the claims			2
@entity90 said : ‘ @entity0 has never had a sexual relationship with a man in his life – not ever			2
’ @entity90 added that he had been ‘ inundated ’ with calls from young women saying they had slept with @entity0			2
he also threatened legal action against @entity112 newspaper for printing claims of an affair by a gay prostitute called ‘ the @entity117 master ’			1
it was only on the first day of the trial when , as a series of witnesses prepared to testify he was gay , that @entity0 admitted he was ‘ bisexual ’ in a three - sentence statement read to the @entity123			1
plans : even as @entity0 and @entity28 they planned their wedding in @entity129 , they argued over the colour of decorations , the theme for functions and the style of clothing his sexuality had been a key aspect of the prosecution case			1
but judge @entity139 , ruled – bizarrely – that this evidence was irrelevant because of @entity0 ’s admission			1
crucially , this meant prosecution lawyers could not allege @entity0 had plotted to have his wife killed because he was secretly gay			1
certainly , lurid tales of gay sex , bondage clubs and trysts in hotel rooms with rent boys were not something that the accused ever wanted to emerge			0
for appearance and status have always meant a lot to @entity0			2
he grew up in a strict , respectable home , the son of a magistrate who ran a nationwide network of care homes , and had a property empire worth millions in @entity160			0
indeed , the family were considered so important in their home of @entity164 - on - @entity165 that other worshippers would wait until they arrived before starting prayers at the @entity168 where they were grandees			0
hired : @entity0 ordered disgraced publicist @entity90 to suppress details of his homosexual double life after going to @entity172 , where he worked hard and got good grades in his a-levels , he studied for a bsc at the @entity176 , where he became general secretary of the @entity178			2
after graduating , he trained as an accountant and worked for @entity180 before joining his brother in the family business as a financial director			0
even then , all the time he was hiding a secret			0
for by his early 20s , he had joined a gay dating website called @entity186 , using the name ‘ asiansubguy ’ – a reference to the fact that he liked to be submissive during sex with men			0
he used the same username to take out a £ 50 - a - year premium membership of another gay dating site , @entity196 , which describes itself as the ‘ world ’s largest hook - up site for men into fetish gear ’			2
and he became a regular at the notorious hoist nightclub in @entity30			0
yet his strict family and religious background meant he kept the truth about his sexuality secret			1
there was also , increasingly , pressure on him from his parents to get married , particularly after @entity210 , his elder brother , settled down			0
@entity0 struggled in relationships with women			2
in 2008 , he was introduced to a tycoon ’s daughter called @entity216			0
they were engaged within three months , but split up soon afterwards			0
three months after that relationship collapsed @entity0 was introduced to @entity219 , a @entity220 engineering graduate , whose family had fled @entity222 during @entity224 ’s bloody rule , and built up a business and a new life four hours from @entity227			1
on a visit to see her cousin , @entity229 , in @entity230 in 2009 , she was introduced to @entity0 by mutual friends			2
he invited her to see the @entity232 at the @entity233 in @entity30			0
the pair continued to see each other , spending alternate weekends in @entity160 and @entity227			0
@entity0 proposed to @entity28 at the @entity237 with a £ 25,000 diamond ring after flying his girlfriend out from @entity30 by private jet in 2010			1
behind the scenes , however , the relationship was in turmoil			0
@entity0 and @entity28 rowed repeatedly and broke up several times during their 18 - month courtship because of his ‘ controlling ’ behaviour and lack of sexual interest in her			1
her cousin @entity250 , who was close to @entity28 , said : ‘ @entity28 felt embarrassed and hurt , and we both felt it was weird			2
@entity28 and i speculated that maybe he was a virgin or perhaps just being proper			0
’ mrs @entity250 added that @entity0 was always ‘ very critical ’ of @entity28 ’s appearance			1
@entity28 even broke off their engagement at one point			0
but mr @entity27 says @entity0 ’s father phoned him and pleaded that @entity28 could ‘ not do this ’ as it would bring the @entity0 family ’s reputation ‘ down to earth ’ if he had a second failed engagement			1
so mr @entity0 instructed his eldest son @entity265 to get @entity0 to be more affectionate , and @entity28 finally agreed to marry him , despite significant ‘ misgivings ’			1
throughout their relationship , he had begun secretly meeting @entity26 , known as the ‘ @entity269 ’ , paying £ 400 for the first of several sex sessions four months after he started going out with @entity28			1
family : the parents of @entity0 , @entity274 and @entity275 ( centre ) arrive at the @entity123 @entity28 and @entity0 ’s rows continued			1
even as they planned the wedding in @entity129 , they argued over the colour of decorations , the theme for functions and the style of clothing			0
at one point , @entity28 texted her cousin : ‘ fighting a lot with @entity0			1
wish i never got engaged			0
everyone tells me how fortunate i am … absolutely sick			0
’ yet when the £ 200,000 wedding finally did go ahead at the five - star @entity293 set on the banks of @entity296 , there were few public signs of tensions as 300 guests watched @entity0 and @entity28 dance to the hit @entity302 song @entity301 – @entity304			1
but after they went to the honeymoon suite , there was little romance			0
@entity0 scolded @entity28 for not folding her clothes and spent the night on the sofa , their marriage un-consummated			1
‘ @entity315 has become my new hobby , ’ @entity28 told a friend in one text			0
she also told friends she was already considering divorce before they left for their fateful honeymoon in @entity320			0
@entity28 ’s father , @entity84 , said when he last spoke to her by phone on the afternoon of november 13 she said she had a ‘ lot to tell him ’ and needed to speak to him when she returned the following tuesday			1
later that night , @entity28 was shot dead after their car was hijacked in a township outside @entity329 , apparently on a sight - seeing tour because , according to @entity0 , she wanted to see ‘ the real @entity320 ’			1
hours after her body was found , police found @entity0 had logged on to @entity186 , the gay dating site , from the luxury hotel where they had been staying in @entity329			2
@entity336 , the uncle of @entity28 , told the @entity96 : ‘ we could n’t care less if someone is gay or not			2
‘ but @entity0 was determined to marry a beautiful heterosexual girl because he is so vain that he had to have a trophy wife			0
whatever else happened , by marrying her knowing that he was gay , he had already ruined her life			0
for that we can never forgive him			0
