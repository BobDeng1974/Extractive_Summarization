we all know that when it comes to doing as they 're told , toddlers can take a little convincing before they comply			0
however one particularly stubborn little girl refuses point blank to give into her father 's demands and provides a compelling argument despite the fact she is not yet able to speak			0
@entity11 father @entity10 was captured on camera telling his 15 - month - old daughter @entity13 to get down off their television table			1
adorable @entity13 seems absolutely adamant that she does not want to get down off the television table as her father , @entity10 , pleads with her but the defiant young toddler is determined to stay where she is and gets impressively mouthy with her dad , not letting her lack of speech stop her			1
the 37 - second video has received over one million views on @entity25 and is currently being shared across social networking sites such as @entity27			1
the video begins with @entity10 firmly telling his daughter : ' get your foot down off that table ! ' the super-cute 15 - month old is clearly having a good time standing on top of the television table at one point @entity10 leans over poking his cute young daughter gently in the stomach but little @entity13 is having none of it and shouts back at her father , shaking her head confidently while staring straight back at him			1
@entity10 then decides to point out that he is in charge and attempts to reinforce his authority with his daughter			0
' you ca n't tell me what to do ' he says while pointing a stern finger at her before adding ' i 'm your boss until you 're 18 , now get down ! ' @entity13 does not seem intimidated by her father whatsoever and continues to shout and wave her arms			0
at this point @entity10 decides to play on his daughter 's muddled speech and pokes her lightly on the chest asking : ' what did you call me ? ' the person behind the camera , who we can only assume to be @entity13 's mother , then giggles as @entity13 shouts back at her unimpressed father			1
' get down this second ' he tells her one more time before @entity13 simply turns away , leaning nonchalantly on the laundry while ignoring her dad 's request			0
at this point @entity10 decides to give up the fight and the video finishes with him picking @entity13 and embracing her as the pair reconcile			2
one thing that does remain unclear , more than @entity13 's broken speech , is how she got up there in the first place			0
eventually @entity10 gives up , hoisting his young daughter off the table and over his shoulder			2
