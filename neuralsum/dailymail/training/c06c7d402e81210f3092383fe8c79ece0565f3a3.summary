a kangaroo with a love for pictures has surprised a trio of @entity5 tourists by demanding a selfie			1
@entity7 and two of his friends were visiting @entity11 in @entity12 when they met a particularly curious character			1
' this one guy seemed pretty curious with us and our @entity18 banter , ' mr @entity14 said			2
' we all knew what he was trying to get at , so we all huddled around and got an awesome selfie pic. ' avoiding the overused duck - face pout , the roo and his new friends opted for the humour inducing mouth - half - open pose			1
but rather than growing disinterested and hopping away , the kangaroo proved hard to please			0
that ’s one happy quokka : @entity38 ’s are n't the only @entity40 animal that love a photo ' admittedly it did take a few goes , but he was a perfectionist and wanted to get the frame right , ' mr @entity14 said			2
however , it seems the overly friendly roo is n't the only @entity40 animal that loves having a photo snapped of itself , as some other social media users found out			0
@entity51 from @entity52 , for instance , found out that cockatoos are all about the perfect pose , not just some free feed			0
