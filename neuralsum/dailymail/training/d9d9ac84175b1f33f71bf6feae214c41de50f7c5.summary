by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:40 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 17:25 est , 4 april 2012 air passengers face long delays at passport control this @entity7 because of ‘ gridlock ’ caused by a shortage of border staff , the @entity3 ’s major airlines have warned			1
their grim predictions were borne out last night when passengers at @entity13 complained of two and a half hour delays			1
one @entity16 passenger , @entity15 , who had flown in from @entity17 , said only three of the 25 immigration desks were manned			1
nightmare journeys : the government was told to expect problems with cuts to staffing at @entity3 airports during the bank holiday weekend the 29 - year - old psychologist said : ‘ it ’s horrendous			1
i ’ve been waiting two and a half hours			1
the whole waiting area is full and no one is explaining what ’s going on			2
’ the chaotic scenes follow a broadside at the government by the @entity3 ’s 11 leading airlines including @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , who said millions of passengers are facing ‘ unacceptable ’ queues getting back into the country			2
they told home secretary @entity46 that staff shortages at immigration , bottlenecks and inefficiencies mean : ‘ at peak travel periods such as the @entity7 holidays , there is the very real chance of gridlock at @entity3 airports			2
’ chaos : in a worse case scenario , scenes like the one pictured of people queuing in @entity13 during the @entity61 snow disruption , in 2010 , could be repeated they said the problem has been exacerbated by a return to ‘ 100 per cent passport checks ’ – following a row last year over lax checks – at a time when @entity71 staff numbers have been cut			2
the predictions of @entity7 air chaos were made in leaked letters to mrs may from the @entity76 representing the 11 major @entity3 airlines , and in a back - up one from @entity38 which spoke of impending ‘ gridlock at peak travel periods , such as the @entity7 holidays			1
’ tight control : home secretary @entity46 was warned that the problem had been exacerbated by a return to 100 per cent passport checks the letter from @entity76 chief executive @entity83 said : ‘ the @entity71 will almost certainly struggle to manage the volume of passengers and queue times at major airports will lengthen			2
‘ the subsequent impact on airline operations , passenger experience and satisfaction could be significant , especially at peak travel times such as @entity7 or during the @entity94 ’s jubilee celebrations			2
’ the aim was to shame the government into abandoning further cuts in @entity71 staff			2
@entity37 is expecting today to be its busiest day over the @entity7 holiday with up to 86,000 passengers travelling			0
more than a million passengers are set to arrive at @entity13 alone between now and the end of the @entity7 school break			0
sunday , april 15 is expected to be the busiest day with 123,350 arriving home ahead of the new school term			0
airports say ‘ unacceptable ’ peak time queues can already exceed two hours , but the @entity108 says that at the worst times they can exceed four and half hours leaving thousands crammed into arrivals halls			0
@entity113 , the union ’s deputy general secretary , warned security was at risk from job cuts			0
‘ those who would wish us harm only need to be lucky once , ’ she said			0
unions say ministers will have to draft in ‘ contingency ’ border staff who have recently retired and with a maximum of two - days ’ refresher training because current staffing rosters ‘ are not flexible			1
’ the @entity128 said it was putting more @entity71 staff on passport control duty over the @entity7 holiday – but declined to say how many			0
backlog : around 2,500 - 3,000 passengers were forced to squeeze into the passport checking area of @entity13 's @entity135 as they wait to be seen by four @entity137 staff during trouble in november , last year @entity139 , head of the 7,400 - strong @entity71 , insisted : ‘ there ’s not a problem			1
my job is to make sure our borders are secure			0
this speculation is unhelpful , unnecessary and alarmist			0
’ a @entity71 spokesman said : ‘ @entity147 is prepared for the busy @entity7 period and has ensured extra staff will be working to carry out vital security checks			0
’ departures from @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 to @entity155 were among those cancelled , with other routes to and from the regional @entity159 hub airports severely affected			0
and a looming strike by @entity162 pilots has forced @entity37 partner @entity164 to cancel journeys between @entity13 and @entity166 on @entity167			0
passengers hoping to travel over the @entity7 weekend - a peak time when 1.5million holiday makers expect to travel overseas - have been warned to check for delays			1
but it is not all bad news			0
the threat of a baggage - handlers strike by staff at @entity177 this weekend has been lifted while negotiations between the @entity180 union and @entity181 , the ground handling company , continue			1
but this development is likely to come as little relief for anyone booked on an @entity164 flight			1
pilots are planning to strike on mondays and fridays from april 9 until july 20 due to a dispute over a new low - cost subsidiary , @entity191 , set to take over loss - making routes .			1

but there 's some relief as *industrial* action by baggage - handlers in @entity177 over easter weekend is called off
