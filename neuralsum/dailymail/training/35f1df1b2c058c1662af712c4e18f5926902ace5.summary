rare bird in flight : this short - toed eagle has got lost on its way from @entity16 to southern @entity18 and ended up in @entity10 by mistake , leading to great excitement among enthusiasts bird lovers : hundreds of people descended on the area with telescopes and cameras hoping to catch a glimpse of the rare bird of prey @entity48 caught sight of the bird of prey while leading a guided walk through the 8,000 - acre woodland			1

by sunday morning their numbers had more than doubled			0
mr @entity48 , 31 , from @entity59 near @entity60 , said : ' i was leading a guided walk in @entity9 when a member of our party spotted a bird of prey in a tree			0
' at first i thought the bird was a pale - faced buzzard , which is very common in @entity10 , but as i got closer i could see i was wrong			2
' suddenly it hit me that i was looking at a short - toed eagle			1
i just could n't believe what i was seeing because spotting one is almost unheard of			0
' i have studied birds all my life and but i wanted to make sure i had identified it correctly so i got in touch with some bird watcher friends and they all confirmed i was right			0
' the eagle flew off 15 minutes after we spotted it but it returned to almost the exact same tree at four or five hours later			0
' i returned on sunday morning and there must have 500 bird watchers there			0
' in bird - watching terms the sighting is huge - never before has a short - toed eagle been seen on mainland @entity4			1
' rare sighting : the birds are common in central and southern @entity18 during the @entity4 summer , especially in the south of @entity30 , but this young bird overshot the area by hundreds of miles short - toed eagles migrate from @entity16 in the spring and can live up to 30 year			1
the birds are common in central and southern @entity18 and have a wingspan of up to 6ft excitement : the crowd on top of @entity101 on saturday , whose numbers grew even more on sunday as word spread online that the bird had unexpectedly arrived in @entity4 after flying off course short toed eagles - @entity106 in latin - over-winter in @entity16 and are most commonly found in central @entity18 , especially southern @entity30 , in the summer			1
they feed on lizards and snakes and hunt from a height of around 1,500 feet			0
mr @entity48 , who runs the charity birds of @entity114 , added : ' this eagle is only a one year old so this is its first migration			2
' the thinking is that it has got a bit lost on the way up from @entity16 where it would have spent the winter			2
' instead of ending up in central @entity18 it has been blown across to @entity4 in the easterly winds we have had a lot of lately			2
' there are plenty of lizards and snakes and in @entity9 so we might just find it sticks around for the summer if we are lucky			0
' crowd control : police were called in to deal with the huge numbers of bird watchers who descended on the small corner of @entity10 over the weekend twitchers at dawn : after an expert spotted the rare short - toed eagle in @entity10 and revealed it on @entity55 hundreds of bird watchers travelled to @entity101 , near @entity9 , to catch a glimpse of the bird , seen on the @entity4 mainland for the first time ever @entity143 , of the @entity144 based at @entity145 , @entity10 , said it was highly unusual for big birds of prey to fly over large stretches of water like the @entity150			1

they do n't like crossing the water and so hardly ever reach here			0
' @entity155 struggle to get across large areas of water as they like to have lots of lift and thermals and warm air			0
' but if one of going to come to @entity4 then @entity10 is the ideal place as it is home to six species of reptiles , three lizards and three snakes			2
