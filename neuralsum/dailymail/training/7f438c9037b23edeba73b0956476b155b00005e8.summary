’ more than one in four private sector workers have suffered at least one annual pay cut or a freeze , rising to 48 per cent in the public sector , according to a report by the @entity42			1
this has helped to protect jobs because bosses have been able to keep control of their wage bill , avoiding staff cuts			1
but the squeeze on income is fuelling the crisis on the high street as consumers have less money to spend			0
the average pay rise last year was just 1.4 per cent , while the consumer prices index , a measure of inflation , is 2.7 per cent			2
the strength of the jobs market is at odds with the weak economic recovery			2
@entity6 figures due tomorrow may show that economic output fell in the final three months of last year , raising fears of a triple - dip recession			0
rise : the number of people in employment has reached an all - time high as the overall rate has improved a number of high - street retailers including @entity73 and @entity74 have recently collapsed into administration			2
@entity76 , economic adviser to the accountancy firm @entity78 ’s @entity79 , said : ‘ these are pretty impressive figures for the labour market in the face of a weak economic environment			0
‘ but the story remains similar to previous months , with the data betraying hints that the labour market might be starting to run out of steam			0

back to work : the unemployment rate has now fallen for 10 consecutive quarters data from the @entity6 also showed a 26,000 increase in the number of women out of work for up to six months , to reach 571,000 , which may reflect changes to the benefits system which have resulted in more single mothers looking for work			1
the number of job vacancies in the economy increased by 10,000 to almost half a million at the end of last year , the highest number for four years , a hint that further falls in unemployment could be on their way			1
@entity138 's is set to create at least 2,500 new jobs over the course of this year , taking its workforce in the @entity21 to 93,500			1
the fast food giant 's announcement comes after the firm created 3,500 jobs in 2012 , growing by more than 20,000 over five years			1

that 's why i am pleased to see how @entity158 is providing training and apprenticeships in a range of skills			1
' @entity158 is also to be applauded for helping adult employees get qualifications in maths and @entity166			1
' @entity138 , chief executive of @entity167 's @entity21 , said : ' these remain challenging economic conditions but i 'm pleased that , together with our franchisees , our continued focus on serving quality , affordable food and giving our customers a great experience is enabling us to keep investing in our business and creating jobs			1
' whilst today 's job market is hugely competitive , we offer many people their first experience of work and we 're focused on doing what we can to help more young people get into quality jobs and careers			1

' these are very positive figures showing employment rising for 15 months and despite difficult economic circumstances , unemployment is lower than when this government took office , ' he said			0
' it 's good to see long - term unemployment falling and the number of young people claiming jobseeker 's allowance dropping again , while the increase in vacancies shows there are jobs out there			1
' but we are not complacent , and will continue making sure we give jobseekers the support and training they need to achieve their goal of returning to work			0
' but @entity236 general secretary @entity235 cautioned against overconfidence , saying : ' any fall must be welcome but progress is still painfully slow for the 2.49million people still desperately looking for a job			0
' the number of @entity244 names going into liquidation shows there is no room for complacency			0
and only yesterday the government announced more than 5,000 cuts to @entity252 personnel			0
' we know that many thousands of public sector workers ' jobs are under threat as council budget cuts mean that elderly care centres , nurseries , swimming pools and other valued services face the axe			1
' @entity263 , shadow work and pensions secretary , said : ' today 's headline fall in unemployment is welcome news , but today 's figures show no roaring recovery , they show very shaky foundations			1
' half of the country saw yet another rise in unemployment , nearly half a million people have been on the dole for more than a year , and youth unemployment rose			1
' boost : @entity15 will take comfort from the positive new employment statistics the @entity279 warned that hiring could slow if new companies were not encouraged to expand			0

' we continue to call for an extension to the current regional @entity290 holiday to all micro firms across the @entity21			2
this could create around 47,000 new jobs and add £ 1.3billion to gdp			0
' @entity295 , chief economist at the @entity296 , argued that the strong unemployment figures cast doubt over the gloomy statistics on @entity21 's gdp			1

losses : @entity88 has announced it is to shed 940 jobs in the @entity21 , damping down the good news @entity88 confirmed its plans to cut hundreds of jobs , adding : ' @entity311 is today announcing 940 role reductions within the group operations , insurance , retail , wealth and international and commercial divisions			1
' @entity311 is committed to working through these changes with employees in a careful and sensitive way			0
all affected employees have been briefed by their line manager today			0
the group 's recognised unions , @entity323 , @entity325 and @entity326 , were consulted prior to this announcement and will continue to be consulted			0
' the group 's policy is always to use natural turnover and to redeploy people wherever possible to retain their expertise and knowledge within the group			0
' @entity335 , general secretary of @entity323 , said : ' this is a bleak start to the year for hard - working employees and is bad news for the @entity21 economy on a day when the small fall in the numbers unemployed was supposed to be good news			2
' the fact that nearly 200 of the jobs are to be outsourced to @entity345 is particularly unwelcome			0
@entity323 is certain that this is not what @entity21 taxpayers would want from a bank in which they are the largest shareholder			2
