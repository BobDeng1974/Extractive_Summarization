@entity0 is n’t normally one for nostalgia			1
while his club and country career is still moving at breakneck speed , his fear is that looking over his shoulder will only slow him down			1
yet when @entity11 ’s name is raised in conversation , the @entity9 captain ca n't help but briefly pause for thought			1
the @entity16 man ’s presence in the @entity18 squad serves as a timely reminder of the remarkable journey both have travelled to reach this point			1
seven years ago , with both players domiciled at @entity24 , the inauspicious home of lowly @entity25 , the notion that they would one day be playing international football seemed rather absurd			1
@entity0 's international career with @entity18 has taken off in recent months @entity0 ( left ) in good spirits at training alongside @entity31 ( centre ) and @entity33 a late developer on the international scene , @entity0 moved to @entity36 and then to @entity9 before @entity37 called him into the squad three years ago by virtue of his @entity41 father			1
for @entity44 , the road to international recognition has been rather more scenic : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and then a left - field move to @entity49 with @entity51 ’s @entity50			1
the b teams of @entity53 and @entity54 , then @entity55 , @entity56 and then a parachute back to the @entity59 game with @entity16 where @entity60 was watching			1
@entity62 , @entity63 and the @entity64			1
old friends reunited on the biggest stage imaginable			1
‘ you do n’t get much time in football to take stock and reflect , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ but sometimes you have to and think : “ i have come a long way ”			1
doing that while not standing still is important			1
‘ but i ’m well aware of how we ’ve both done and how far we ’ve come			1
i ’m proud of that and glad i ’ve done it this way			2
we played in the youth team together at @entity25 and also came through to the first team together			2
then we went our separate ways			2
‘ it ’s been great to see the journey he ’s been on , to see how far he ’s come			2
he always had ability and a lot of potential			2
unfortunately it did n’t quite come through at the time			2
‘ he ’s had to do it the hard way and he ’s had a long , old journey			1
it was a bold decision for him to go to @entity49			2
he went to @entity47 first — i actually played against him when i was playing for @entity36			2
@entity11 is @entity18 's brightest prospect ‘ i caught up with him then and he said he was exploring a few different things			1
i always kept an eye on him over there ( @entity49 ) and then when we went to pre-season we played against @entity50			2
so we always had these little moments when we caught up			2
‘ not many have come through there			2
a few have played in the @entity103 but not many the way he did it by getting signed by a b team in @entity49 and then there was that link with the owners at @entity110 , then there came the move to @entity16			2
but it ’s worked out really well for him			0
‘ a player like that , and how hard he worked , there was no doubt in my mind he was going to come into football at some point			0
it was just a question of at what level			0
you just hoped he got a chance to kick on and he has			0
’ @entity0 ca n’t help but grin while recalling his early exchanges with @entity44 at @entity25 when the distant prospect of representing @entity18 one day was whispered about			1
asked if @entity124 - born @entity44 knew @entity0 was eligible for @entity18 back then , he quipped : ‘ i did n’t even know i was @entity41 in those days ! no , we did know			1
we ’d had a chat about it as i was desperate to get into the under - 21s at that point but that did n’t quite happen			0
‘ he said he was born there as well			0
i do n’t know if he knew about me but i knew about him			0
he has got quite a diverse background			0
‘ he ’s still the same height he was then although he had bigger hair at that point			0
but as a person — yes — he has grown			0
’ of that , there is no doubt			0
just 14 month after making his debut for @entity18 in a home loss to @entity142 , @entity44 ’s place in the hearts of the @entity145 has long been secured			1
if his engagingly bright off - field personality is enough to illuminate a darkened room , then the moment he sped away to beat @entity148 in @entity149 cemented his status and underscored what he ’s capable of bringing to the table			0
‘ he has been brilliant , ’ @entity0 opined			1
‘ he offers us something different that not a lot of players have got			0
he ’s got electrifying pace while he ’s also now added a real end product to his game			0
‘ i think his pace scares defenders that ’s for sure			0
you do n’t want to be coming up against someone that quick as there ’s not many ways you can handle it			0
he scored against @entity62 and then produced an assist against @entity63			0
’ @entity44 scored for @entity18 against @entity62 in their opening @entity173 qualifier @entity0 believes the man - manager skills of @entity60 have much to do with @entity44 ’s remarkable rise in a dark blue jersey and added : ‘ the manager has given him so much confidence			1
when he does come away with @entity18 you can tell he ’s really bubbly			1
‘ he loves being involved with @entity18 and you can see it with the way he plays			1
‘ it ’s testament to how hard he works — not many work harder than him			0
‘ i ’m really pleased for him with this success , especially having known him for so long			1
‘ the transformation in him has been huge over the past 10 years			0
‘ he always had the ability but i do n’t think he had the mentality to cope with it when he was 17 , 18			0
which a lot of players do n’t			0
‘ sometimes it takes a bit longer			0
at that age , when you work hard and have a lot of ability , you can still be hard on yourself			0
‘ you need a mentor to put an arm around you and point you in the right direction			0
