losing your opening game at a @entity2 is a blow and saturday night ’s defeat leaves @entity6 ’s hopes of progressing hanging in the balance			1
but i honestly think there are more positives than negatives to take from the game , with @entity15 ’s gamble on @entity16 - and the teenager ’s fearless performance - both reasons to be optimistic			1
i say this with my professional head on and as an @entity6 fan , and i ’d be surprised if a lot of my fellow @entity6 fans disagreed			2
sure , i would have liked us to win , and we came closer than many may have expected			0
but @entity16 , still 19 and in an @entity6 senior shirt for just a fifth time , was a breath of fresh air , attacking without fear , taking people on , going for goal , playing like he ’s enjoying trying to win			1
reason to be cheerful : @entity16 was superb against @entity35 , here taking on @entity36 @entity37 paid off : @entity16 was a breath of fresh air and attacked @entity35 at every opportunity his pass to @entity42 that @entity42 then crossed superbly to @entity43 for 1 - 1 was a peach			1
and his early shot on goal from distance that rippled the side netting rather than ending up in the back of the net was the kind of effort that makes you get out of your seat			2
@entity56 was lively too , although perhaps slightly more cautious			2
@entity42 , as i ’ve said a number of times , should be playing in his preferred position			2
but given that he ’s not , he still laid on @entity6 ’s goal			1
the downside was the way @entity6 conceded two goals			2
the first was a training ground move , executed beautifully			0
@entity69 ’s shot - after @entity36 ’s insouciant dummy - went through legs and @entity71 had no chance			0
but as with the second goal , when @entity74 met @entity76 ’s cross , being completely switched on to all the possibilities of @entity35 ’s options would have limited them			0
@entity80 : @entity56 was good , if more cautious than the rampaging @entity16 the upshot is that in football your most important game is always the next one — and after saturday night , for @entity6 that now means @entity85 in @entity86 on thursday			1
there could n’t be more at stake			0
@entity6 are capable of winning but there will be some major psychology at play because of @entity92 and his closeness to his @entity95 team - mates			1
i ’ve been there and done that in terms of playing against a club - mate in a massively important @entity2 match , never more so than in the 2006 quarter - final against @entity103			1
alongside me in the @entity6 line - up that evening in @entity104 was fellow @entity106 player @entity42 — and we were up against @entity106 ’s @entity108			1
we all know how that ended , with a draw and the heartbreak of penalties , again , for @entity6			2
@entity108 winked after @entity42 was sent off			1
there were all sorts of suggestions that they hated each other , to the extent that when we all got back to @entity106 training we handed them both boxing gloves ! they did n’t need them , they were fine			2
but it highlights the special tensions at play			0
on the one hand , there ’s comfort in it because you know everything about them — their capabilities , moods and motivation			0
team - mates : @entity138 consoles @entity92 following the draw against @entity140 best of enemies : @entity138 must not show @entity92 ( right ) any mercy when @entity6 face @entity85 all smiles : @entity138 and @entity92 celebrate the @entity145 's goal against @entity146 in march double - edged sword : @entity138 and @entity92 will know everything about each other but there ’s also a negative that falls somewhere between respect and fear , because they know you so well too , what you can do , and especially your weaknesses			1
so assuming @entity92 is up against @entity138 and @entity158 in @entity6 ’s two - man defensive cover shield , he will already be armed with all the knowledge of how to take advantage			1
i ’m certain there will have been no contact between @entity6 ’s @entity95 players and @entity92 in @entity166			1
you need a clinical emotional detachment at times like this , no hint of club camaraderie			0
on the pitch you are enemies with just one focus : winning			0
if this sounds extreme then it goes further			0
i was mates with @entity178 as we came through the @entity180 youth system together in the nineties			0
we spent a lot of time together , were close friends , had all that shared experience			0
special tension : @entity42 ( centre ) and @entity108 ( right ) after the @entity145 's sending off in 2006 change in relationship : @entity189 ( right ) and @entity178 grew apart after the defender 's move to @entity192 but when i moved to @entity192 in 2000 and he went to @entity195 not long afterwards , we grew apart			1
and it was n’t organic , it was a deliberate mutual shedding of a friendship because that closeness is simply not compatible with our jobs			0
at the highest levels of sport there is an intensity and professionalism that means you do n’t want to give any opponent any edge whatsoever , no insight into your thinking or your behaviour			0
and that ’s why for the duration of this @entity2 and for the @entity85 game , @entity92 ’s @entity95 team - mates will be blanking him emotionally as they do their job			1
the most obvious area for @entity6 to exploit is the heart of @entity85 ’s defence			1
the 33 - year - old captain @entity218 has 95 caps and is a decent player			0
but he spent last season with a mediocre @entity223 side and is now unattached			0
@entity6 ’s forwards will be licking their lips at the opportunity to test him			2
to celebrate the @entity2 , i 've added a special @entity229 to my fashion range , incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and and with a share of the proceeds going to charity			2
you can find them via www.5mag.co and you can follow me on @entity238 for a chance to win exclusive prizes @ rioferdy5			0

@entity15 's gamble on playing @entity16 paid off
@entity56 was lively and @entity42 laid on the goal
@entity92 close to @entity95 team - mates such as @entity138
@entity6 play @entity85 on thursday in @entity2 @entity248
@entity92 will have knowledge of how to get better of @entity138
@entity42 and @entity108 were ok at @entity106 after 2006 @entity2
