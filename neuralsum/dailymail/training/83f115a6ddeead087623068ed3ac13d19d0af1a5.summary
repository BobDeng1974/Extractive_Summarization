a man infected with a @entity2 - like illness has become the first person in @entity4 to die from the virus			1
the 39 - year - old , who died in the intensive care unit at @entity8 ’s @entity8 , caught the illness from his father , who had become infected while travelling in @entity11 and the @entity12			1
so far there have only been four confirmed cases of the illness in @entity4 and 12 anywhere in the world , with six deaths			0
it is from the same virus family as @entity2 , which claimed 900 lives worldwide in 2002 and 2003			0
but scientists say novel coronavirus is nowhere near as dangerous as it has difficulty spreading between humans			1
the man who died on sunday was suffering from a long - term condition which made him more susceptible			1
his father is still being treated at a hospital in @entity42			1
and another member of the same family who also caught the virus is being treated at the hospital in @entity8			1
separately , a 49 - year - old man infected in @entity48 in september is also in hospital			1
scientists think the illness may be spread via bat droppings or through water droplets from coughs and sneezes			0
three people have died in @entity57 and two in @entity59			2
a hospital statement released today said : ' the patient was already an outpatient at @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , undergoing treatment for a long - term , complex unrelated health condition			1
' the patient was immuno - compromised and is believed to have contracted the virus from a relative who is being treated for the condition in a @entity42 hospital			1
' @entity8 is working closely with the @entity69 which is currently following up other household members and contacts of this case			1
professor @entity73 , head of the respiratory diseases department at the @entity69 , said : ‘ this case is a family member who was in close personal contact with the earlier case and who may have been at greater risk of acquiring an infection because of their underlying health condition			1
' to date , evidence of person - to - person transmission has been limited			2
although this case provides strong evidence for person to person transmission , the risk of infection in most circumstances is still considered to be very low			0
' infected patients have presented with serious respiratory illness with fever , cough , shortness of breath and breathing difficulties			0
the lining of the lung , or epithelium , represents an important first barrier against respiratory viruses a statement issued this afternoon by the @entity69 said the man who died and another of the @entity4 cases had no recent history of foreign travel , suggesting that transmission had occurred in @entity4			2
a @entity69 spokesman said : ' one person has sadly died			2
this patient had an underlying condition that may have made them more susceptible to respiratory infections			1
' the first patient in this cluster , who had recent travel history to @entity57 and @entity11 , is still receiving treatment			1
' the third case , who had a mild illness , has recovered			0
' today , experts suggested the virus could potentially be treated by targeting the immune system			2
the coronavirus ( @entity128 ) belongs to the same family as the coronavirus @entity2 , which surfaced in @entity131 more than a decade ago and infected 8,000 people worldwide , killing around one in 10 of them			2
it 's thought the virus can penetrate the lining of the passageways in the lung and evade the immune system as easily as a cold virus can			0
the research also reveals that the virus is susceptible to treatment with interferons , components of the immune system that have been used successfully to treat other viral diseases , opening a possible mode of treatment in the event of a large - scale outbreak			1
now scientists at the @entity151 at @entity152 in @entity153 , have tested how well the virus could infect and multiply in the entryways to the human lung using cultured cells manipulated to mimic the airway lining			0
the lining of the lung , or epithelium , represents an important first barrier against respiratory viruses			0
but , said co-author dr @entity163 , this part of the body does not put up a big fight against @entity128			0
he and his colleagues found that human airway epithelial cells are highly susceptible to @entity128 infection and that the virus is able to multiply at a faster initial rate than the sars virus			0
he said : ' surprisingly , this coronavirus grows very efficiently on human epithelial cells			2
' the researchers asked themselves whether boosting this weak immune response might diminish the virus ' ability to infect airway epithelial cells			0
they found that pre-treating the cells with proteins that are released in response to infection , significantly reduced the number of infected cells			0
but he added : ' we do n't know whether the cases we observe are the tip of the iceberg , or whether many more people are infected without showing severe symptoms			0
' the findings were published in the online journal @entity195 .			0

the patient , who was being treated at the @entity8 , died on sunday
was a relative of patient being treated in @entity42 after bringing back coronavirus from @entity12
hospital says patient was already receiving treatment for long - term , complex health condition
