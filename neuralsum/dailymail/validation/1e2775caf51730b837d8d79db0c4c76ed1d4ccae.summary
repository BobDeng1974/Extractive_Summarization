surgeon @entity0 , pictured with his wife , who has been suspended by the @entity2 a foreign plastic surgeon who left a pensioner scarred for life has been suspended after it emerged there have been 60 complaints about his work			1
the @entity2 has barred @entity0 , who is one of a number of ' fly in fly out ' surgeons who jet into the @entity13 from @entity14 to operate in private hospitals and then return home			1
@entity0 , who lives in @entity17 with his tv star wife , is understood to have quit working in the @entity13 last year after he failed to compensate @entity19 for a bungled facelift in 2010			1
mrs @entity19 , 67 , from @entity21 in @entity22 , has been left with scars after suffering from necrosis , a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of skin cells - and was left with open flesh wounds			1
she was awarded £ 43,000 in compensation by a court in @entity32 but is unlikely to receive the cash as the surgeon 's insurance company say he did not report the bungle to them			1
the @entity37 , which organised the £ 8,000 surgery , went into administration but is not legally responsible for the surgeons it uses			2
last month , the @entity2 stepped in after it became clear that there may be other victims of @entity0 , after as many as 60 patients are understood to be complaining about their care			2
he has also been stopped from working as a doctor for 12 months while it is decided if he will face a disciplinary hearing			1
@entity0 has also worked for the @entity51 , who say that his rights to treat patients at their hospitals had been withdrawn			2
now mrs @entity19 is calling for the government to take action over ' fly in fly out ' foreign doctors who fly into the @entity13 and undertake procedures before returning home			1
she said : ' he never talked about necrosis at all			0
he talked about the normal risks but at no point at all did he mention necrosis			0
i just remember him saying that he would make me happy			0
' when they took the drains out of my face it hurt so much , i screamed and it started to go purple			0
it went from a large purple bruise to a huge black scab that had the feel and look of leather			0
@entity19 who developed necrosis after undergoing a facelift performed by @entity0 , an @entity80 surgeon , who has been suspended by the @entity2 mrs @entity19 was awarded £ 43,000 in compensation after the botched facelift but has yet to receive any of the money ' surgeons should not be limited to their country but the government should make sure there is a level of accountability through qualifications and insurances			1
' clinics should also be responsible for the actions of the surgeons they use			0
' clinical negligence lawyer @entity96 , of law firm @entity97 , is now pursuing the case			0
mrs @entity19 , pictured with her lawyer @entity96 , is now calling for ' fly in fly out ' surgeons to be regulated she told the @entity102 : ' clinics normally ask the surgeon themselves to be insured			1
if something goes wrong a patient can not sue the clinic , they have to pursue the surgeon , which is extremely difficult if they are based abroad			0
' it is really easy money for surgeons as the procedures are more expensive here and they do n’t have to pay for the clinics			0
' but if things go wrong very often it falls back on the @entity120 to put things right , which begs the question why there is not more regulation			0
' dr @entity0 refused to comment on the allegations against him when contacted at his @entity17 home .			2
