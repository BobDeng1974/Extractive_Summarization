the @entity0 has apologised for using the iconic @entity2 poster from the 1970s to promote an upcoming exhibition but will still feature the work			1
the poster featuring blonde model @entity6 , who was 18 at the time the image was taken , attracted a flurry of criticism when the official @entity11 account included it in a post promoting the @entity14 exhibition			1
some followers accused the home of wimbledon of sexism for highlighting the image , taken by the @entity19 in 1976 at the @entity21 's tennis courts and printed by @entity22			1
' we apologise for offence caused by the @entity26 poster			0
it is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it , ' the profile later said after removing the post			0
@entity22 's @entity2 poster caused a @entity11 stir and @entity31 was forced to apologise after using it to promote a forthcoming exhibition called @entity14 last year the dress worn by @entity35 in the famous image , the wooden tennis racquet she is holding , a a 1979 edition poster and a 1980s limited edition canvas print were sold at auction for £ 15,500			1
while such a price may indicate its historic value and iconic status , many on @entity11 felt it had no place as a promotional tool for the exhibit in which it features at the respected venue			2
tennis fan @entity51 expressed her outrage on @entity11 , saying : ' ca n't believe @entity31 used this pic for upcoming ' @entity54 '			2
' @entity56 fans who go by the name ' @entity59 's @entity58 ' on @entity11 , posted : ' come on @entity60 ! i thought you were the classy slam ! ' the @entity0 used the iconic poster , which will be exhibited with the handmade dress worn by model @entity6 and wooden racquet used in the 1976 shoot , to promote the exhibition even the wording of the apology attracted criticism as a @entity11 user responded with the comment : ' the poster does n't show the history of tennis , the girl is n't a tennis player , you are just publicising sexualisation of females			1
' and campaign group the @entity84 asked : ' @entity31 having deleted your tweet , can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition ? ' twitter user @entity88 backed the club , saying : ' presumably @entity90 will now have to be airbrushed out of @entity31 history ? these pc idiots - " they can not be serious ! " ' an @entity0 spokesman has since confirmed the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology			2
he added : ' we 're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis			1
' the image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular , selling over two million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893			2
' not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only			2
' last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster , one of the world 's best - selling , really is that controversial after all			0
use of the saucy shot on the official @entity11 page immediately raised eyebrows on @entity11 @entity56 's fan group said : ' come on @entity60 ! i thought you were the classy slam ! ' @entity132 tweeted : ' @entity31 are getting stick for sharing iconic poster			1
political correctness gone mad / do n't pretend you 've never seen it before ! ' @entity137 posted : ' @entity31 [ has ] nothing to apologise for – i think it 's a great poster , is of its time in history			0
' @entity141 said : ' @entity31 has just tweeted an apology for any ' offence ' caused by a link to the 40 - year - old @entity146 poster			0
the world 's gone mad			0
' others merely saw the funny side			0
' i think @entity31 were right to delete the @entity22 poster tweet , ' one @entity11 user wrote			1
' no one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again			0
' the year - long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum 's collection , an 1893 advertisement for @entity160 , through to the original artwork for this year 's @entity162 at the world famous venue in @entity165 .			0
