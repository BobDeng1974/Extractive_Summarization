it has been a national favourite for more than 100 years and can be found everywhere from ‘ greasy spoon ’ cafes to luxury hotels			0
but it now seems that brown sauce is increasingly being left on the shelf by consumers			1
sales of the condiment fell by 19 per cent last year , according to industry analysts , with changing food tastes and a greater awareness of healthy eating thought to be behind the drop			1
sir @entity27 referenced it in his poem @entity30 , while @entity32 ’s wife once complained in a newspaper interview that the former @entity36 prime minister would ‘ drown everything in @entity19 ’			2
however , figures from market research company @entity38 show that sales of brown sauce fell from 16 million kilos in 2013 to 13 million kilos last year , with the amount spent on various brands dropping 17 per cent from £ 47 million to £ 39 million during the same period			1
experts say that the public ’s concerns over salt content , a decline in the popularity of cholesterol - busting dishes such as breakfast fry - ups , and the rising popularity of other breakfast foods such as porridge , have caused the decline			2
but despite the news , fans of the sauce are determined to prove that it has n’t had its chips			0
mail on sunday food critic @entity60 said : ‘ a fry - up without @entity19 is unthinkable , as is a bacon sandwich			0
‘ it ’s a taste of @entity65 long past , and you ’ll find it everywhere from @entity68 - topped cafe tables to the gilded magnificence of @entity70			0
‘ it is a great @entity71 condiment , the perfect mixture of rich fruit and sharp vinegar			0
‘ let ’s hope the drop is a blip rather than long - term decline			0
this is an @entity80 – @entity81			0
’ both @entity19 - a national institution since its creation in 1895 - and tomato ketchup sales are down sales of tomato ketchup are also down , but not as steeply as brown sauce , mainly due to the large quantities consumed in fast - food outlets			1
@entity90 , senior food analyst at @entity38 , said : ‘ volume and value declines of brown sauce and ketchup reflect changing eating habits			1
the most common reason to forgo table sauces is a typical meal no longer requires them			0
’ a spokesman for @entity100 , the @entity101 firm that bought the @entity71 brand in 2005 and which also owns rival daddies , said : ‘ this is at odds with our data and independent analysis			1
‘ @entity19 has seen slightly lower value sales since smaller packs have proved popular			2
‘ however , sales of @entity19 bottles are up two per cent , reflecting its ongoing popularity			2
’ both @entity19 and @entity114 are made in the @entity115 , leaving the ok range by @entity118 - based @entity117 as the @entity71 ’s only home - produced brown sauce .			1
