what do a @entity2 man , a guy who flew from @entity3 to @entity4 and thousands of other feverish worrywarts across @entity6 have in common ? they 've all checked in to hospitals in recent days believing their headaches and nausea could be the dreaded ebola virus			1
and they 've all been cleared			0
their numbers are also growing			0
since @entity17 became ' @entity6 's patient zero ' on september 30 , the @entity16 says its gotten over 800 calls per day from local health workers and other officials desperate to know , ' does my patient have @entity24 ? ' @entity25 of false alarms : a @entity2 man checked into @entity29 's @entity28 on wednesday over fears he had the dreaded ebola virus			1
doctors later cleared him in all cases except @entity17 's , that answer has been an emphatic no. but after the widely panned government response in @entity36 to @entity17 's diagnosis and thanks to a steady stream of suspected case news stories every day , the false alarms are n't expected to end any time soon			2
@entity41 and @entity29 have seen two of the most recent of these cases			1
on wednesday , a @entity2 man checked into @entity28 complaining of a fever and was initially treated as a potential @entity24 case , according to the @entity47			1
the man had recently traveled from @entity3 and was suffering from diarrhea and vomiting , but was apparently given the okay			0
' there 's nobody with @entity24 and nobody suspected of having @entity24 at @entity55 , ' a hospital spokesman told the @entity47			0
the @entity41 case in @entity57 on tuesday was actually one of 8 in the county who 've been tested , according to @entity61			0
all tests have come back negative			0
another major city where multiple false alarms have made headlines is @entity66 , where @entity24 was ruled out as a potential cause of illness in a man at @entity70 just days after @entity17 's diagnosis			1
around the same time , at nearby @entity73 , a patient was found to have the flu and not @entity24 , as was initially feared			2
hands are tied : the @entity16 says any potential @entity24 patient is someone with a fever who 's recently traveled to @entity80 nations currently dealing with the @entity24 outbreak , so hundreds or even thousands of people in @entity6 have become -- if ever so briefly -- suspected cases since ' patient zero ' @entity85 was diagnosed sept. 30 a third @entity66 - area patient , in the suburb of @entity89 , had @entity24 ruled out as a possibility that very same weekend			1
on wednesday , an @entity92 flight landed at @entity94 airport in @entity95 and passengers filed out wearing masks after a passenger ' exhibited one symptom of the ebola virus on a flight from @entity36			2
' she too , experts ruled , is @entity24 - free			0
according to @entity106 's math using @entity16 's numbers , some 5,000 @entity24 false alarms have been sounded since @entity17 was diagnosed			2
as news of @entity17 's wednesday morning death was still breaking , another potential @entity24 case -- and potential false alarm -- came out of @entity95			1
a deputy sheriff who entered the @entity36 apartment the @entity114 occupied while he was ill checked in to a @entity116 , @entity95 hospital wednesday afternoon exhibiting ' signs and symptoms of @entity24			1
' @entity120 's son , @entity119 , told @entity121 that his father had woken up with ' stomach issues ' and had gone to the clinic as a precaution			0
@entity119 said family were told by the @entity16 that their father was not at risk of the virus , as he had only been in the apartment for 30 minutes and had not come in contact with bodily fluids			0
' we are not expecting him to ' test positive for @entity24 , said @entity119			0
widespread fear : @entity137 in @entity138 had a ' potential @entity24 patient ' on tuesday who turned out to be another false alarm , one of 8 in the county thus fay			1

a @entity2 man checked into a @entity29 hospital on wednesday complaining of possible @entity24 symptoms after traveling to @entity3
