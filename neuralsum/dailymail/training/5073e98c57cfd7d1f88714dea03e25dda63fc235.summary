@entity0 is no laughing matter			1
one such person , is mother - of - three @entity0 who lived her whole life with @entity8 which was so debilitating it caused her to have constant thoughts that her family would be harmed if she did not carry out her cleaning rituals , which would see her scrubbing for hours on end and constantly rinsing her bare hands in bleach			1
for years her family did not realise @entity0 , 29 , from @entity19 , was suffering from the condition but her husband @entity1 began to gt an inkling when she demanded he wash the cat			1
she asked him to put his mother 's pet in the bath when she saw her children were stroking it			1
he did and it scratched his arm to pieces			1
he then realised she was ill but even that did n't make @entity0 seek help			1
the condition started when she was just a young child			1
nobody knew what it was and none of her three sisters suffered such behaviours			1
she was just four when her beloved @entity40 passed away			1
she decided that by ritualistically jumping over the fish - pond she would be able to stop anyone else in her family from leaving her			1
unable to swim , this obsessive ritual nearly drowned her			2
' i do n't know why i did it			2
the problem with @entity8 is it does n't have any rules			1
for me it was just that , " if i can make it to the other side then everything would be fine "			2
' it was a coy carp fish pond so it was really big and really deep			2
every time that i would try to jump across it i would go under			2
it was fortunate that i had sisters and my parents were around , so people were around to help me			2
' ' it was n't really something that was spoken about back then			2
i did n't know why i was doing it			2
i kind took it upon myself to think there was nothing wrong with me and everyone else had the problem , they were dirty			2
i would blame everyone else			2
' this early experience set @entity0 on a path of extreme and crippling @entity8			1
when she gave birth she refused to hold her babies due to fear of germs			2
' it happened with all three of them			2
with @entity78 i had n't been diagnosed and i could n't go into hospital equipped to tell midwives " it 's not me being a bad mum or not feeling love for my child "			2
@entity0 ( l ) and sister @entity85 and sitting in the sunshine as children , with the dreaded fishpond behind them ' the thought of blood all over me was too much			1
' midwives were taken back when i refused to hold him			2
when my @entity8 got to its worst people sometimes confused it with me not loving my children , but it 's the opposite			1
the fear of them getting sick is overwhelming			2
' it 's really difficult to discuss with people			2
i have thoughts about them being murdered and my husband throwing them over the balcony			2
it 's because that would be my worst case scenario			2
if anything ever happened to one of my kids i would n't carry on living			0
' @entity0 , who starred on @entity112 's @entity111 , has now written a book , coming clean : living with @entity8 , all about her life living with a consuming and crippling condition			1
she would obsessively clean patches of the floor to prevent any harm coming to her children , but would then forget to pick them up from nursery as she found this task so absorbing			0
@entity0 and @entity1 on their wedding day when she was still undiagnosed she would wash her hands 60 times a day in neat bleach and her denial continued until the day her husband @entity1 , who works as a team leader at a medical supplies company , insisted she go to the doctors to seek help			1
they had both presumed that she had been suffering from post-natal depression until then			0
' we were going to a family event and he rushed me out of the house , i was hitting him and i was crying			0
' the only way i can describe it is that i thought if he dragged me away from bleaching the toilet i would get punished and something bad would happen to the kids			0
i could almost see someone putting a gun to my kids ' heads			0
' eventually @entity1 turned the car around and @entity0 could get back to her ritual			1
@entity0 enjoying a cosy moment at @entity155 with her husband and three children ' i went back into the bathroom , finished bleaching the toilet and i was fine			1
' the following day he sat me down and said " do you think that was normal the way you were behaving yesterday ? " ' but i did n't understand			0
he realised this is n't right and booked me an appointment at the doctors			0
' i was very much in denial			0
there was a fear inside me of being stopped			0
i felt so sure that if i didnt carry out these rituals that my children would die			0
i was waiting for the inevitable to happen			0
' eventually @entity0 , a full - time mother to three children all under the age of ten , had a course of cognitive behavioural therapy and was put on a drug called fluoxetine			1
' it 's not one of those things where you 're cured overnight , ' says @entity0			1
' it 's taken me years and years to get to the point where i am at now			0
after a while i thought i was in control and stopped taking the medication			0
my body started having spasms , my legs started shaking			0
i remember crying to my husband and wondering what 's wrong			0
' even after diagnosis and having taken medication for some time , the illness continued to blight her life and nearly drove her to suicide			1
' i ended up getting to point where i felt like i was a bad mum			0
i thought that i was mental , ' she says			0
' the reason i wanted to take my own life is it got to the point where i was cleaning for hours and hours			1
i was wrecking my hands washing in bleach			0
i was consumed by these thoughts and felt the only control i could have was over whether to take my own life or not			1
' looking at kitchen knives i thought about stabbing myself but worried about the blood splattered on the floor			1
i was thinking of " clean " ways i could do it and googling how many pills i would need to take			0
enjoying a day at the beach with two of her boys ( l ) she was n't keen to let @entity78 go on this ride on his own ( r ) ' it happened after i was diagnosed			0
to begin with nothing seemed to change or get better			0
i was at a point where i felt like i was going crazy anyway			0
i was convinced my kids were going to get taken away from me			0
' it will be the first time - in the book - that some of my family members would have heard of it			1
it 's very much a secret illness which is why im doing the book and the show , encouraging people that it is okay to talk about it			0
' @entity0 eventually got weaned off her medication and is now using @entity234 or @entity235			1
' that might not work for everyone but i 'm at a place now where that 's enough to take the edge off			0
' i eventually realised @entity8 is just a thought and you ca n't let it control your life			1
it bullies you and blackmails you			0
' and @entity0 admits the @entity8 does creep back in			1
coming clean : living with @entity8 is out now ' rightly or wrongly the bleach is very much still a part of my life			1
i bleach my toilet all day every day religiously			0
if i ca n't smell it in the bathroom i 'll top it up immediately			0
i take everything out the fridge and bleach it , too			0
' but her husband keeps @entity0 in check			1
when he 's with me he is quite key in seeing the signs			0
' i sometimes do n't realise if i 'm washing my hands several times , he 'll remind me and i will then know that i need to reign it back in			0
' if i panic over something he 'll say " @entity0 , it 's just a thought " ... he 's good at reassuring and reminding me			1
' and @entity0 keeps an eye on her kids , too			1
' my middle son wo n't share a drink or utensils			0
i have been monitoring that			0
having lived through @entity8 myself , i would n't want him to go through that			1
' coming clean : living with ocd by @entity0 with @entity275 is published by @entity276 and is out now for Â£ 7.99			1
the new series of @entity112 's @entity111 starts in september .			0

@entity0 , 29 , from @entity19 , has suffered @entity8 all her life
