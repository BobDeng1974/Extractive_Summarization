@entity0 were made to pay the price for a raft of missed chances by @entity4 when @entity5 scored an equaliser deep into stoppage time			1
@entity8 looked to have saved the blushes of his misfiring team - mate when he sent @entity0 ahead			1
but substitute @entity11 took advantage of some shocking defending by @entity13 in @entity0 's defence to level the score			1

on this display it was hard to see why @entity72 have bid for @entity4 in recent years and why @entity74 and @entity75 have both shown interest in him			2
the @entity78 striker has been criticised in @entity79 for failing to live up to his £ 55million price tag when he moved from @entity81 last year			2
in the absence of @entity84 , out with a heel injury , the 27 - year - old has been handed the chance to drive the team forward			2
but on a night when virtually everything he tried went wrong , @entity0 had to rely on the sprightly @entity8 to finally find the net			1
it began going wrong in the first half			0
on 38 minutes , he rose highest at the near post in an attempt to reach @entity39 's cross from the left only to flick the ball , taking it off the head of @entity43 who would surely have opened the scoring			1
instead it was the away side who had came closest to breaking the deadlock in the opening 45 minutes			1
the home side were left frustrated as they struggled to find a way past @entity17 rivals @entity5 @entity0 trio @entity4 , @entity41 and @entity43 react after missing an opportunity @entity5 's chance came a minute before the break , @entity58 passing into @entity53 who sent a first - time shot crashing off the crossbar			1
and @entity4 's night got no easier early in the second half			0
he did well on 57 minutes to turn one way and the next before laying the ball off to substitute @entity42 , who forced @entity5 goalkeeper @entity35 into a smart save at his near post			0
but two minutes later he swung wildly at the ball on the edge of the box , completely mistiming his shot , and the ball bobbled before being cleared high into the air			0
as @entity4 looked up , it was hard to tell if he was following the flight of the ball or pleading to the football gods for mercy			0
if it was the latter , they failed to listen as a minute later he was played in by @entity40 , burst through on goal then fell over			1
@entity0 were fortunate the score remained goalless just after the hour when the ball dropped to @entity53 and he had just defender @entity135 to beat but struck a weak shot so that the @entity0 man could fling a leg at the ball to divert it wide			0
finally , the home side found a player who could stick the ball in the net , when the whippet - like @entity8 stole in a the back post to put @entity0 ahead in the 71st minute			1
that seemed like it would be enough for all three points , until @entity0 failed to clear in second - half stoppage time and @entity11 took a touch before finishing with a low strike			1
@entity152 thought his side were feeling the effects of their impressive 3 - 2 win against @entity156 on tuesday			1
' they were very tired after the @entity156 game			0
we have done a marathon , this was our seventh game in 23 days			0
it ’s not illogical that the lads were at the end of the road			0
' i am not worried			0
@entity166 are top and deserve it			0
but they do n’t play in @entity168 , do n’t forget			0
' @entity5 boss @entity170 , on the other hand , thought his side were unlucky not to grab all three points			2
' it was an even game but @entity5 had the better situations			0
we could have done better than a draw			0
' a pitch invader was escorted away after running onto the @entity33 pitch @entity181 sprint and long jump legend @entity178 acknowledged @entity0 fans before the start of the @entity17 encounter @entity0 's president @entity185 looked in jubilant mood during the match at the @entity33			1

@entity11 came off the bench to level the scoring
@entity8 scored in the 71st minute to put his side in the lead
@entity181 sprint legend @entity178 was *paraded* on the @entity33 pitch before the @entity17 encounter
