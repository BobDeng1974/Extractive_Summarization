by @entity0 lawyers , accountants and financial advisers who turn a blind eye to organised crime will face five years in jail under new laws to be unveiled in the @entity8			1
hundreds of white - collar professionals who help the most dangerous gangsters evade the law but are not directly involved in crimes will be targeted by police			1
they help gangs set up their illegal businesses by writing contracts , arranging property purchases , offering advice or sending funds overseas			1
facing the threat of jail : hundreds of white - collar professionals who help the most dangerous gangsters evade the law but are not directly involved in crimes will be targeted by police the crackdown will also tackle ‘ mr @entity27 ’ , such as the @entity29 crime syndicate , who often plan and co-ordinate crimes but avoid prosecution because they do not ‘ get their hands dirty ’			1
the wide - ranging overhaul of the law will be laid out in a @entity37 in the @entity8			1
similar to @entity40 ’s anti-mafia laws , the legislation is part of a concerted drive by ministers to land a blow on @entity46 ’s £ 24billion - a - year organised crime industry			1
the @entity47 is determined to focus on the corrupt professionals behind the underworld gangs who bring terror to the streets of @entity46			1
the so - called ‘ crooks in suits ’ help crime bosses set up their illegal businesses by writing contracts , arranging property purchases , offering advice or sending funds overseas			2
but they avoid ending up behind bars by adopting a ‘ no questions asked ’ approach and then claiming in court they had no idea that they were involved in a crime networks			1
now a new offence of participation in an organised crime group – which includes everything from credit card fraud to cigarette smuggling – will allow police and prosecutors to take action against these individuals			2
the authorities will only have to prove there were ‘ reasonable grounds ’ to suspect an individual knew they were helping carry out wrong - doing			2
the measures will also target others who help gangs commit crimes by , for instance , renting warehouse space , hiring vehicles or delivering packages			2
those convicted under the new offence would face up to five years behind bars			0
ministers believe up to 200 people , including professionals such as lawyers and accountants , will go to prison under the laws each year			1
' nobody is above the law ' : @entity103 home office minister @entity102 said the new offence sends out a clear message to professionals helping criminals the move follows rising concern about crime lords such as @entity110 , an @entity112 businessman known as ‘ @entity113 ’ whose gang a judge said was involved in fraud , money - laundering and extreme violence , and the @entity29 , whose members have been linked to at least 25 murders worldwide , as well as drug trafficking , extortion and hijacking			1
@entity47 minister @entity102 said : ‘ nobody is above the law			2
but for too long corrupt lawyers , accountants and other professionals have tried to evade justice by hiding behind a veneer of respectability			1
‘ this new offence sends out a clear message to those individuals - if you are helping to oil the wheels of organised crime , you will be prosecuted and face being jailed			0
’ ministers will also beef up powers to prevent ‘ mr @entity142 ’ holding onto their multi-million pound gains because of flaws in the enforcement system			0
the aim is to close loopholes which enable criminals to get round confiscation orders and tackle those who avoid paying			0
the shake - up will bolster prosecutors ’ ability to freeze assets and introduce prison sentences for offenders who hold onto their illegal profits			0
the proposed legislation comes in the wake of a highly critical report by the @entity159 which warned only 26p in every £ 100 generated by criminal activity was recovered by the authorities			2
under the changes , criminals who ignore court orders to repay over £ 10million of illicit gains will lose their right to early release from prison			0
organised crime bosses will be barred from using ‘ designer divorces ’ to conceal their illegal profits			0
assets will be allowed to be frozen earlier in investigations and the maximum time to pay confiscation orders will be increased from six to 12 months			0
some £ 1.48billion is currently outstanding in unpaid confiscation orders			0
one of the worst examples of criminal defiance is convicted fraudster @entity179 who still owes taxpayers £ 57.2million			0
@entity179 , who was jailed in 2006 and is now free , made his illicit fortune from a dotcom swindle and used the money to buy a £ 3million house overlooking @entity186 golf course , another home in @entity188 , a yacht and an art collection			0
the oldest outstanding confiscation order is for £ 300,000 and dates back to 1988 .			0

lawyers and accountants who help gangs will be targeted by new law
legislation to be unveiled in @entity8 is similar to @entity200 laws
professionals have so far evaded justice by adopting ' do *n't* ask ' approach
