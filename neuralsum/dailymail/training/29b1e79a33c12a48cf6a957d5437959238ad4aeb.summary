for the first time in more than a century , no @entity1 singles players has reached the round of 16 at @entity4			1
the last two of 23 @entity1 entrants departed on monday			0
first , @entity6 withdrew because of a strained left thigh before the scheduled resumption of her third - round match that was suspended because of darkness on saturday			1
then , no. 9 @entity11 lost his third - round match despite hitting 52 aces , eliminated 6 - 7 ( 8 ) , 7 - 6 ( 6 ) , 7 - 6 ( 3 ) , 7 - 5 by 19th - seeded @entity15 of @entity16			1
for the first time in more than a century , no @entity1 singles players has reached the round of 16 at @entity4 after stars including no. 1 - seeded @entity19 crashed out early not since 1911 have zero @entity1 men or women participated in the round of 16 at @entity4 , according to the @entity22			1
that year , no @entity1 women even entered the tournament and only three men did			2
this year , there were 13 women from the @entity1 , including no. 1 - seeded @entity19 , a five - time @entity4 champion who lost her third - round match saturday			1
there were 10 @entity1 men in the field , but @entity11 was the only one ranked inside the top 65			2
' i do n't care ' : @entity11 lost his third - round match despite hitting 52 aces and was disinterested when informed about the embarrassing @entity1 statistic told how long it 's been without any @entity1 sticking around for the latter stages at the @entity38 , @entity11 replied : ' i did n't know that			1
do n't really care , either			0
' he could be excused for tiring of those sorts of statistics and questions , which have been adding up			0
last year at @entity4 , no @entity1 men made it to the third round			1
no man from the country has played in the quarterfinals at any @entity52 tournament since 2011 , and the last to win a major championship was the now - retired @entity54 at the @entity55			1
' some of this is cyclical			0
some of it is we 've done a poor job , ' seven - time major champion @entity60 , a tv analyst for @entity61 and the @entity62 , said before @entity4 began			1
' we got , maybe , " spoiled " is an accurate word			2
we expected there would be more ( @entity66 ) @entity65 , @entity67 , ( @entity69 ) @entity68 , ' @entity60 said			0
down and out : @entity6 withdrew because of a strained left thigh before the scheduled resumption of her third - round match ' because of the worldwide interest in sports , if you go back to the ' @entity75 , when tennis became part of the @entity75 again , more countries put more money and resources into it to allow more kids to play tennis , so more countries have more of an interest and they see the upside of it			1
that same thing has n't happened for us in the @entity1 ' the @entity92 , for example , has three women into the quarterfinals at @entity4			2
@entity95 has one woman that far , and one man in the fourth round			0
@entity15 gives @entity16 three men in the fourth round , along with @entity100 and @entity101			0
' when you beat players like @entity11 , when you go through a difficult match like this , you have to be proud of yourself , ' said @entity15 , who hit 34 aces and saved the only two break points he faced			0
' to beat @entity60 on that court is such is difficult task			0
' @entity60 , left , celebrates with the trophy after winning the @entity111 at the @entity4 in july 1981 , while @entity112 , right , lifts the trophy after winning in july 2000 @entity15 earned the only service break of the match in the next - to - last game with a cross-court backhand passing winner that he celebrated by leaping and punching the air			1
it was the only time @entity11 was broken during his three matches this year at the @entity38			0
' i just could n't get into his serve games			0
for me it was hard , ' said @entity11 , best known for winning the longest match in tennis history , 70 - 68 in the fifth set at @entity4 in 2010			2
' i tried , i tried , and i just could n't break through			0

not since 1911 have zero @entity1 men or women participated in the round of 16 at @entity4
' we got , maybe , " spoiled " is an accurate word , ' said seven - time major champion and tv analyst @entity60
the last @entity1 male to win a major championship was the now - retired @entity54 at the 2003 @entity140
