so here comes another one , just like the other one			2
the best team in @entity3 have the toughest @entity5 draw			2
meanwhile , @entity9 meet @entity10 and @entity11 face @entity12			1
each tie listed here is a repeat of last year ’s pairings			2
it is so tame , so predictable			2
when will uefa sort out the abomination that is their seeding system ? scroll down to see the full list of @entity5 fixtures for the @entity23 sides @entity24 @entity25 @entity26 @entity27 @entity28 @entity29 @entity30 @entity31 @entity32 @entity33 @entity34 @entity35 @entity9 @entity10 @entity36 @entity37 @entity7 @entity6 @entity8 @entity38 @entity39 @entity40 @entity41 @entity42 @entity11 @entity12 @entity43 @entity44 @entity45 @entity46 @entity47 @entity48 simply the best : @entity49 arrives at the @entity5 draw in @entity35 click here to find out all about @entity9 's @entity5 group for a body so keen on fairness , the concept goes out of the window whenever the dead hand of @entity58 reaches for its little balls in bowls			1
the elite are protected so that @entity9 , who last won the title in 2004 and needed to pre-qualify this year , are shielded from the toughest opposition , while @entity6 , reigning champions with two title wins in three years , must again climb a mountain to reach the later stages			1
@entity70 in favour of the established elite so that there were more champions in pots b and d than in marquee pot a. this produces ferociously unfair match - ups			2
every team in @entity82 , for instance , are national champions — @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 — while @entity9 and @entity11 have to contend with a single league winner apiece , @entity37 of @entity84 for @entity85 , @entity44 of @entity86 for @entity11			1
@entity6 face @entity7 and @entity8 , champions of @entity89 and @entity90			1
rewarded : @entity9 's narrow qualification win has ensured them a winnable group , despite finishing fourth @entity93 : @entity94 and @entity30 will play in the @entity5 this season click here to find out all about @entity6 's @entity5 group the whole process reeks of protectionism			1
@entity99 , @entity58 president , says he will address this at the next @entity5 summit , but then bleats that he needs the permission of the clubs to change			0
he means the old , rich ones of course — it is not as if the others matter			0
the co-efficient rankings that are used to insure the most powerful against their mediocrity could equally be used to implement a fairer competition			0
@entity58 ’s points system also reveals the identity of the strongest leagues in club competition — currently @entity116 , @entity3 , @entity89 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity90 and @entity119			0
so the champions of those countries should be the seven top seeds , plus the @entity5 holders			0
this would create a more egalitarian pot a , comprising @entity24 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity32 , @entity25 , @entity8 , @entity40 and @entity28			1
@entity127 - @entity30 tues sep 16 v @entity31 ( h ) weds oct 1 v @entity29 ( a ) weds oct 22 v @entity28 ( h ) tues nov 4 v @entity28 ( a ) weds nov 26 v @entity31 ( a ) tues dec 9 v @entity29 ( h ) @entity132 - arsenal tues sep 16 v @entity10 ( a ) weds oct 1 v @entity36 ( h ) weds oct 22 v @entity37 ( a ) tues nov 4 v @entity37 ( h ) weds nov 26 v @entity10 ( h ) tues dec 9 v @entity36 ( a ) deja vu : @entity138 drew @entity6 in @entity139 but they face a tougher task than they should ... yet again group e - @entity6 weds sep 17 v @entity7 ( a ) tues sep 30 v @entity38 ( h ) tues oct 21 v @entity8 ( a ) weds nov 5 v @entity8 ( h ) tues nov 25 v @entity7 ( h ) weds dec 10 v @entity38 ( a ) looking to progress : @entity116 's goalkeeper @entity149 drew @entity11 in @entity150 @entity150 - @entity11 weds sep 17 v @entity12 ( h ) tues sep 30 v @entity43 ( a ) tues oct 21 v @entity44 ( h ) weds nov 5 v @entity44 ( a ) tues nov 25 v @entity12 ( a ) weds dec 10 v @entity43 ( h ) in the goals : @entity158 has scored twice already this season for new club @entity11 champions of @entity3 : @entity6 will hope to go far in the @entity5 this season click here to find out all about @entity30 's @entity5 group pot b would then be taken from the champions of the next eight leagues off the rank , if they had qualified – meaning @entity168 ( @entity46 ) , @entity169 ( @entity41 ) , @entity84 ( @entity37 ) , @entity170 ( @entity29 ) and @entity171 ( @entity26 ) , plus the second - placed teams from @entity116 ( @entity39 ) , @entity3 ( @entity30 ) and @entity89 ( @entity10 )			1
using this system , pot c would be @entity27 , @entity48 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity38 , @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity11 , and pot d the remainder , including @entity9 and @entity34 , who can not surely expect to come fourth and be seeded any higher			1
that way there would be genuine movement in the rankings , and fresh match - ups each year			0
and , yes , under that system @entity6 could end up with @entity26 , @entity42 and @entity31 and @entity9 with @entity28 , @entity41 and @entity38 — but as one team won its league and the other came fourth , why should it be any other way ? this is the @entity5			1
that title should mean something			0
champions of @entity58 : @entity28 won the competition for the 10th time in their history last season click here to find out all about @entity11 's @entity5 group instead , domestic success counts for nothing and the same teams meet year after year , often with the same results			1
this is the third time in four seasons that @entity6 will have faced @entity7 at the group stage , and the same applies to @entity9 and @entity10			1
how is that healthy , or compelling ? when the @entity5 began it felt exotic and new , now the group stage only gets interesting if one of the big boys messes up			0
it is a routine revenue - generating process , there to fill tv primetime and only undertaken as a means to an end			0
we know the serious stuff begins after @entity215 , once a free draw heralds the arrival of the knock - out stage			0
deep down , that is what football ’s establishment fears , of course : not being good enough , not being up to the test			2
it is to @entity58 ’s shame that they then indulge this naked protectionism			0
either @entity99 is complacent , or foolish ; probably both			0
