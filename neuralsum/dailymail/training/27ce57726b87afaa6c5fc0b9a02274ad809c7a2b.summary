while this @entity2 black bear in southwest @entity3 wo n't have seen @entity5 's @entity4 or read @entity7 's source material , it shows it has the dancing skills to match the story 's star @entity9			1
the breed dubbed the ursine species ' ' most bizarre ' by @entity7 appears to throw shapes with an unsuspecting birch tree as its partner in footage taken with hidden cameras in a wildlife reserve			2
in reality , it 's more likely the majestic creature with the distinctive white marking on its chest is marking its territory and simply having a good old scratch of its hard to reach places , but the resemblance to @entity29 's mate is uncanny			0
and while it 's believed @entity9 's character is based more on the sloth bear found in @entity32 , the preacher of the @entity35 's diet of ' only roots and nuts and honey ' is more consistent with this very @entity2 black bear			1

it was caught on cameras placed by scientists at the land of the @entity47 park in the @entity83 region			2
research for the scientists centres mostly on the local @entity87 leopard population which , with as few as 45 adults left in the wild , is a contender to be the rarest of the big cats			0
