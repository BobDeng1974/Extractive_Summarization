@entity0 claims @entity2 boss @entity1 is failing to get the best from summer signing @entity4			1
@entity4 , who signed for @entity2 from @entity6 in a £ 75million deal in july , has been mainly deployed in a wide position from @entity1 and has scored just two goals in 10 games for the @entity12 giants			1
@entity13 manager @entity0 believes the @entity15 forward would be more help to the team if playing centrally			1
@entity2 star @entity4 is being wasted out wide , claims @entity13 manager @entity0 ' his coach knows more than us , but the wing is not the best place for @entity4 , ' @entity0 told @entity23			1
' he 's a goalscorer and you lose 50 per cent of that on the wing			0
' you need to be in the centre , not on the wing			0
@entity4 is one of the best strikers in the world and i think that @entity1 is trying to find a tactical solution to this			1
' while i think this @entity2 team has the same desire to hoard the ball as before , they do not have the same speed as they used to			2
' @entity4 has scored just two goals in 10 games for the @entity43 club since his move from @entity6 @entity0 believes @entity45 will need a fit @entity46 to defeat @entity2 next year the former @entity48 boss also declared that @entity2 should have little trouble brushing aside @entity45 in the forthcoming @entity50 last 16 matches			1
the only way the @entity54 champions can win is to hope @entity46 is fit , thinks @entity0			2
he added : ' i do not think @entity45 will be a difficult opponent for @entity2 , ' he added			0
' @entity45 did not do well in qualifying because they are missing something - they lack speed and they lack desire			0
' at this point , they would be easy opponents for @entity2			0
but , in february we 'll see because they will have [ injured forward ] @entity46 back			0
he 's one of the best players in world football			0
' @entity4 celebrates putting @entity2 into a 3 - 1 lead against @entity68 earlier this month			2
