by @entity1 reporter published : 19:24 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 08:48 est , 11 march 2014 it takes high - tech computing power , dummies fitted with up to $ 700,000 in sensors and about 600 tests a year to ensure @entity9 vehicles meet global safety standards			1
the car manufacturer today opened the doors of its @entity14 in @entity15 to show what it takes to get a new vehicle on the road			2
@entity9 , which recently completed its 20,000th crash test since 1954 at @entity14 , this afternoon put a 2014 explorer through its paces			1
in the blink of an eye , the vehicle rolled down a track and slammed into a barrier at 30 miles an hour , with slow motion cameras and expensive dummies capturing every millisecond			0
one of the latest tests , for example , involves simulating a crash into a tree or phone pole			2
' we need to make sure these global products can meet all of the regulatory and public domain testing requirements for the markets that they are going to , ' @entity50 told @entity66			0
the automaker has more than 500 safety engineers around the world who have conducted more than 31,000 tests at 1,800 sites			2
crash test dummies : @entity9 uses these full - scale anthropomorphic test devices which represent children and adults in their crash tests costly : dummies cost between $ 50,000 to $ 700,000 each when fully instrumented sensors : crash test dummies are fitted with up to 100 devices streaming 300 channels of data to document the impact and effects of a collision @entity87 reported @entity9 has more than 100 dummies - or full - scale anthropomorphic test devices ( @entity90 ) - ranging from an 18 - month - old toddler for child seat testing to a large male			1
they range in price from $ 50,000 to $ 700,000 each when fitted out with up to 100 devices which stream 300 channels of data documenting the collision impact			1
the crash vehicle is also painted to highlight critical elements , with sensors , accelerometers and high - speed cameras installed to capture as many as 30 different views of the crash and measure the forces of the impact			0
the faces of the dummies are also painted to show where they hit the airbag			0
expert : @entity113 , supervisor of full - vehicle crash and @entity115 , examines the data collected from full - scale anthropomorphic test devices used during crash tests research : @entity9 has performed two million crash test simulations in the past ten years @entity14 crash lab supervisor @entity113 said the crash data , which is downloaded within half an hour of the crash , is analyzed over about two weeks			1
but before a vehicle is launched into a wall , engineers spend weeks running thousands of computer simulations			0
@entity87 reported @entity9 has increased its computing power by 50 percent in the last decade and is doubling its power every two years to produce safer vehicles .			0

@entity9 today tested the 2014 @entity35 at its @entity14 in @entity15
the car manufacturer recently completed its 20,000th crash test since 1954 at @entity14
it has conducted more than 31,000 tests at 1,800 sites around the world
@entity9 has more than 100 dummies which range in price from $ 50,000 to $ 700,000 each
they *'re* fitted out with up to 100 devices to measure the collision
it can take up to two weeks to process the crash data
