war widows who choose to remarry will no longer lose their pensions , the prime minister has announced today			1
for decades the wives of fallen servicemen have had to choose between finding new love and financial stability under a complex scheme introduced in 1975 that stopped the pensions of military widows who remarried or cohabited with someone after the death of their spouse			1
this morning @entity15 abolished the ' absolutely wrong ' loophole before joining the @entity17 in central @entity18 on the eve of @entity20			1
speaking of the change , mr @entity15 : ' this is a long - standing grievance and i think one which is very justified - people who were married to someone in the armed services and that person died and so they lost their pension if they married again			1
' i think that was n't fair and i 'm delighted that because we have a strong economy we can afford to make this change and give justice to these people			0
he added : ' this reflects our clear commitment to uphold the @entity51 which we enshrined in law			0
' previously , he described the rules as ' absolutely wrong ' , adding they forced widows into an ' agonising choice between loneliness and financial security ' , the @entity53 reports			1
mr @entity15 was joined by members of the @entity61 at @entity62 to announce the change the @entity17 today performed in central @entity18 as the weekend 's remembrance events began defence secretary @entity65 said : ' it ’s vital that we do right by those who put their lives on the line for their country - that ’s why this government enshrined the @entity51 in law			2
' the move was welcomed by the @entity61 , representatives of which joined mr @entity15 at @entity62 this morning			2
@entity79 , chairman of the @entity61 , said : ' we 're delighted that mr @entity15 and mr @entity65 have been courageous enough to correct this injustice			2
' after campaigning for this amendment , which will benefit a small number of war widows whose partners died in service to their country , we are delighted that the government has decided to provide pensions for life			1
' it is absolutely wrong that some @entity51 widows lose their pension if they choose to remarry			1
' others highlighted the plight of military spouses who , they said , were often prevented from earning a pension themselves by having to move across the country at the request of the forces			0
' as the spouse of a member of the @entity105 your career can take a back seat as a result of relocation and frequent moves , therefore many miss out on the chance to build up an independent pension pot , ' @entity101 , director general of the @entity102 said			0
war widows today welcomed the change in the rules for which they had long been campaigning ' the @entity51 recognises that no one should suffer a disadvantage due to @entity120 , and that the bereaved are entitled to special consideration			0
' that is why today 's announcement , that all widows and widowers will retain their pension for life , is so important			0
' we congratulate the government on recognising that this is a @entity51 issue and enabling @entity51 widows and widowers to live on			0
' the change comes after years of campaigning by the @entity61 to secure pensions for around 4,000 widows deprived of stately income once remarried			2
while anyone whose military spouse died after april 5 2005 or before 31 march 1973 is allowed to keep their pension , thousands in between would have to go without under the previous rules			1
the new rules will come into effect on april 5 2015 , meaning anyone war widows or widowers who remarry after that date will still be eligible to claim military pensions			1
widows or widowers who are already remarried or plan to marry before that date will not be able to reclaim money they would have been entitled to under the new rules , however			2
while the change has been widely welcomed , campaigners are calling for the same rules to now apply to widows of police and emergency service workers			1
@entity162 ( care of @entity164 ) , the charity which supports the families of police officers killed as a result of their job , has launched an online campaign to be considered by the government			0
this morning the prime minister joined the @entity17 in central @entity18 in the first of his engagements to commemorate the war dead this weekend			0
later he is expected to attend the @entity176 's @entity175 at @entity177 .			0

@entity15 scrapped ' absolutely wrong ' loophole in pension scheme
under 1975 rules widows who remarried or cohabited lost military pensions
anyone who remarries after april 2015 will be eligible to claim *payment* again
campaigners are now calling for rules to apply to emergency service widows
