launched this week , the three - month pilot project offers a glimpse into the future of customer service at airports as management teams take advantage of new forms of technology			0
@entity1 is the first in the @entity20 to use @entity3 , which is similar to a pair of spectacles and is equipped with an optical display			2
flying into the future : @entity1 's welcome team is using @entity3 to assist travellers the hands - free device displays digital information and allows users to access the internet or apps using voice commands or snap photos with just a wink			1
until the end of the year , @entity1 ’s welcome team , @entity36 , will be using the headsets to assist passengers with questions about their flights , the airport , the city itself or other topics			1
but privacy watchdog @entity46 is raising concerns about the use of @entity3 in airports , saying @entity1 management should think ‘ very carefully ’ about whether the device is appropriate			1
@entity51 , the organisation ’s director , told the @entity53 : ‘ the danger with @entity3 is that the camera is seeing what you see , all the time , while the microphone allows nearby conversations to be eavesdropped on			2
‘ it is impossible to guarantee against these devices being hacked , so it is surprising that this technology is allowed anywhere like an airport or government buildings			0
’ wearable technology : users can access the internet or apps with voice commands or snap a photo with a wink @entity75 spokeswoman @entity74 dismissed the group 's claims and told @entity78 that all of @entity75 ’s products have protections against hacks			0
she said @entity3 does not record a person ’s every move , it does not pick up sounds around them and video recording is limited to 10 seconds by default			2
the recording time can be extended but the device ’s battery is n’t suitable for long - term recording			0
she added : ‘ @entity3 is also built with social signals in mind - it works through your voice or by tapping it , and you have to look directly at whatever you are recording , so it 's clear when you are using it			1
‘ there are lots of devices you can use to secretly record things but @entity3 is n't one of them			2

‘ the fact that it ’s the first trial of its kind in a @entity122 airport is exciting as it shows we ’re leading the way in how we interact with our passengers			0
' over the next few months we ’ll be able to establish whether this product is suitable for an airport environment			0
’ privacy watchdog @entity46 said it is ' surprising ' that the technology is being used at an airport the trial is part of a partnership the @entity20 's fifth largest airport and @entity133 , the parent company of @entity36			1
a handful of airports or airlines have tested @entity3 to determine if it is useful to them			0
