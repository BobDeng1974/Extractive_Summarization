@entity1 interior minister @entity0 publically dressed down @entity3 ambassador @entity2 during a july 4 garden party a @entity1 minister has publicly dressed down the @entity3 during the @entity3 ambassador 's july 4 garden party			1
@entity1 interior minister @entity0 denounced the @entity3 ' espionage ' of @entity1 and other countries			1
@entity0 was guest of honor at the fete hosted by ambassador @entity2 in @entity13 today			1
in a speech before hundreds of guests , he said that ' in the name of our friendship , we owe each other honesty			2
we must say things clearly , directly , frankly			0
' he said that president @entity23 's demand for clear and precise explanations about reports of @entity3 spying are justified because ' such practices , if proven , do not have their place between allies and partners			1
' @entity32 countries agreed yesterday that planned talks on free trade with the @entity3 must start in parallel with discussions on @entity38 surveillance			2
the speech comes after revelations that @entity1 security agents regularly spy illegally on people 's phone calls , emails , and social media activity , intelligence sources confirmed today			1
revelations about the covert activities follow president @entity23 attacking @entity3 for its own espionage activities , and saying they should stop ' immediately '			1
@entity51 , the most famous and best respected newspaper in @entity1 , today carries a detailed report outlining the behaviour of the @entity54 , the country 's notoriously ruthless external intelligence agency			1
it says the @entity54 intercepts signals from computers and telephones - including foreign ones - to work out ' who is talking to whom '			0
such activity boils down to wiretapping , even though this is officially strictly forbidden following a number of scandals in the past			0
' all of our communications are spied on , ' says @entity51 's report , quoting unnamed intelligence sources , as well as remarks made publicly by intelligence officials			0
' emails , text messages , telephone records , access to @entity77 and @entity78 are then stored for years , ' it says			0
tensions between @entity1 and the @entity3 have been strained since former @entity38 worker @entity80 leaked documents suggesting @entity3 regularly spied on its @entity32 allies such activities are just like those carried out by the @entity38 , as described in documents leaked by former @entity38 worker @entity80			1
he confirmed that the @entity38 keeps vast amounts of @entity89 data under a programme called @entity91			0
it includes emails , chat room conversations and videos taken from sites run by giants like @entity77 and @entity98			0
the @entity3 government also gathers so - called ' metadata ' , noting the time , duration and numbers called - all listed by service providers like @entity105			2
@entity1 's @entity54 has publicly always insisted that it works within the law , but its past activities have included the sinking of the @entity110 ecological protest boat in 1985			2
the operation against the @entity113 craft - which caused the death of a @entity118 activist - violated @entity116 neutrality and caused international outrage			0
@entity1 security agents regularly spy illegally on phone calls , according to reports , which will embarrass president @entity23 , who has vocally criticsied the @entity3 it was ordered by former @entity126 president @entity125 , who was himself linked with an illegal wiretapping cell within @entity1 itself			1
but @entity1 's national security commission has challenged @entity51 's report , saying that the only body that collects communications information was a security agency controlled by the prime minister 's office			1
earlier this week , president @entity23 threatened to block negotiations on transatlantic trade following revelations that the @entity3 spied on its allies			1
' we can not accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies , ' mr @entity23 said			2
' we ask that this immediately stop			0
there can be no negotiations or transactions in all areas until we have obtained these guarantees , for @entity1 but also for all of the @entity150 , for all partners of the @entity3			1
' the @entity54 revelations will now leave mr @entity23 looking , at best , incredibly naieve , and at worst extremely hypocritical			0
@entity1 's seven other intelligence services , including domestic secret services and customs and money - laundering watchdogs , have access to the @entity54 data , writes @entity51			2
@entity159 is said to have a similar spying programme on international phone and internet traffic , and is said to share personal information with the @entity3 @entity38			0
a spokesman for the @entity54 in @entity13 refused to comment directly on @entity51 's report .			0

@entity167 was guest of honor at ambassador @entity2 's party
told hundreds of guests that such practices ' do not have their place between allies and partners '
comes amid revelations @entity1 security agents illegally spy on residents
will embarrass @entity1 president who has been vocal in criticism of @entity3
