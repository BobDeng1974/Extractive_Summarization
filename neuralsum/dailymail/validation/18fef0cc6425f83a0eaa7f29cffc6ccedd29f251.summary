spy chiefs have been told by @entity1 to recruit middle - aged mothers because they are ' emotionally intelligent ' and skilled at relationships			2
the @entity4 said @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 should start advertising on the @entity10 website			1
an inquiry by the @entity1 and peers on the committee found that action was needed to break through the ' permafrost ' of middle - aged men dominating the ranks of the intelligence agencies who have a ' very traditional male mentality and outlook '			1
@entity22 plays a former @entity6 officer - called @entity23 - who joins an @entity5 counter-terrorism division in the tv show @entity26 across the three agencies , women make up 37 per cent of the workforce but hold only 19 per cent of the most senior roles			1
@entity32 's @entity31 , who sits on the @entity4 , said yesterday that recruiting a greater number of women would make the security services better at their job			1
she highlighted the particular skills mothers have in building relationships – a vital talent for spies trying to recruit informants			1
' women who have had children and brought their families up , they have valuable life experience , ' the former @entity43 minister said			1
the dominance of men , by contrast , ' can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career ' , she said			2
women deliver a ' more consultative , collaborative approach '			2
@entity58 @entity31 said more women spies were needed mrs @entity31 said : ' if all intelligence professionals are cut from the same cloth – sharing similar backgrounds and characteristics – then they are likely to share ' unacknowledged biases ' that will circumscribe both the definition of problems and the search for solutions			1
' according to the inquiry , her view that women can make for a better working environment for spies was backed by sir @entity75 , the former director of @entity7 , the listening agency			1
' i find that the discussions are deeper , i think they are more emotionally intelligent and , if you like , i think there is more intuition in the room , ' he said			2
mrs @entity31 said the need for @entity6 officers to be able to deploy abroad – sometimes at short notice – could be a problem for women with children			1
she added : ' there is a bit of testosterone in the system that says , ' tickets , money , passport – we all have to get there '			2
and if you 've got children , finding 24 - hour childcare is often very difficult			2
' mrs @entity31 also revealed that the @entity103 drama @entity26 had made it harder for @entity5 to recruit women a string of its female characters met a grisly end , such as being blown apart trying to rescue a home secretary from a bomb			1
@entity112 and the @entity114 actress @entity113 pose during a photocall on location for the shooting of the 24th @entity119 movie ' spectre ' in @entity121 in a report out today the @entity4 will call for a number of reforms to be introduced within the next 12 months across the agencies , including culture change , help for women who have had children to stop them being sidelined and career advice			1
targeted recruitment should also be carried out , including through websites such as @entity10 , it recommends			1
ms @entity31 said : ' changing the culture is the one area that is most difficult to articulate and , crucially , to take action on , but if you want change , that is where to start			0
i ’d make a great spy			0
i go totally unnoticed everywhere i go , but i have a keen eye for detail			0
nobody suspects a woman in mum boots of anything underhand			0
if they need someone whose special skill is getting melted chocolate down her dog - haired jumper and not noticing , i ’m their woman			0
i ’ve always said that a crack team of mothers could knock most governments into a cocked hat			0
i would love to be a spy			0
and no one would suspect me			0
i am too boring and frumpy			0
well i ’m not signing up			0
everybody i get attached to dies a horrible death			0
' it is clear to us there are those at middle management level - referred to by some people as ' the permafrost ' - who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook			0
' this can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career and does not fully recognise the value of a more consultative , collaborative approach			0
' we therefore recommend that there is a real focus on identifying and tackling the barriers that can exist at middle management level , so that women and men can fully achieve their potential in a supportive team ethos			2
' the @entity4 hopes that this report and the specific recommendations it contains will galvanise support for , and lead to further concerted efforts to create , a more gender diverse workforce in the agencies			1
' former @entity195 secretary of state @entity194 , who conducted a similar investigation into women in the @entity198 , said improving diversity would help in the response to threats to national security			2
she said : ' as ms @entity31 rightly says diversity should be pursued - not just on legal or ethical grounds , important as these are in their own right - but because it will result in a better response to the range of threats that threaten national security			0
' much of what is said in this report echoes and reinforces my own work on the director 's advisory group on women in @entity4 at the @entity198			1
' i am sure we will all benefit from close cooperation on these vital issues between our two countries			0
