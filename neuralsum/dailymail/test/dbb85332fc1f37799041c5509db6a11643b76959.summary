@entity3 were the better team for much of the first half but goalkeeper @entity42 had to be aware to keep out @entity28 from close range at the other end			0
that was their best chance until @entity45 handled inside his own penalty area with 20 minutes to go to gift @entity9 the chance to give the home side the lead			0
that opportunity was one he gratefully accepted , confidently dispatching his spot - kick past @entity42			0
