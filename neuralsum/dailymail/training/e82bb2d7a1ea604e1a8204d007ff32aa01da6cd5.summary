an avocado a day could help improve bad cholesterol levels , claim researchers			2
the ‘ avocado diet ’ also improves other blood fat scores linked to heart disease – even in the overweight			1
researchers say a daily helping of avocado can replace unhealthy fats in the diet with a healthier version			1
a daily avocado appears to lower levels of ' bad ' cholesterol in the body , reducing the risk of a heart attack study leader @entity19 , chair of the @entity21 ’s nutrition committee , said : ‘ in the @entity23 avocados are not a mainstream food yet and they can be expensive , especially at certain times of the year			2
‘ also , most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole			2
' but guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips , which are high in calories and sodium			0
‘ @entity34 , however , can also be eaten with salads , vegetables , sandwiches , lean protein foods ( like chicken or fish ) or even whole			0
’ in the study 45 healthy , overweight or obese patients between the ages of 21 and 70 were put on three cholesterol - lowering diets			0
for the study researchers used @entity47 avocados , the ones with bumpy green skin			1
participants consumed an average @entity23 diet ( consisting of 34 per cent of calories from fat , 51 per cent carbohydrates , and 16 per cent protein ) for two weeks prior to starting one of three cholesterol lowering diets			2
they were assigned to a lower fat diet without avocado , moderate - fat diet without avocado , and moderate - fat diet with one avocado per day			2
' many people do not know how to incorporate avocados in their diet except for making guacamole and eating it with corn chips , which are high in calories and salt , ' the researchers warned the two moderate fat diets both provided 34 percent of calories as fat ( 17 per cent of calories from monounsaturated fatty acids / @entity76 ) , whereas the lower fat diet provided 24 per cent of calories as fat ( 11 per cent from @entity81 )			1
each participant consumed each test diet for five weeks			0
the researchers found that compared to the baseline average @entity23 diet , low - density lipoprotein ( @entity87 ) - the so called ‘ bad cholesterol ’ - was 13.5 mg / @entity89 lower after eating the avocado diet			1
in a patient with high ldl , this would be the equivalent of a 10 per cent fall			0
@entity87 was also lower on the moderate fat diet without the avocado ( 8.3 mg / @entity89 lower ) and the lower fat diet ( 7.4 mg / @entity89 lower ) , though the results were not as striking as the avocado diet			1
several additional blood measurements were also more favourable after the avocado diet including total cholesterol and triglycerides			1
the findings are published in the journal of the @entity21 ( must credit )			0
in addition to @entity81 , avocados also provided other beneficial compounds that could have contributed to the findings such as fibre and phytosterols			0
the heart - healthy @entity111 diet , includes fruits , vegetables , whole grains , fatty fish , and foods rich in monounsaturated fatty acids -- like extra-virgin olive oil and nuts			0
dr @entity121 , distinguished professor of nutrition at @entity123 , in @entity124 , @entity125 , said : ‘ this was a controlled feeding study , but that is not the real - world - so it is a proof - of - concept investigation			0
‘ we need to focus on getting people to eat a heart - healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient - rich food sources of better fats			1

experts : most people do *n't* know how to incorporate avocado into diet
