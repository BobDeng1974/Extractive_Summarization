by @entity0 @entity1 insists the future is bright for @entity3 despite their inconsistent form under manager @entity6			1
striker @entity1 , who was appointed captain by the @entity9 boss in the summer , could not prevent @entity10 turning over the @entity11 on sunday			1
a 3 - 1 lead for @entity3 slipped away as @entity10 claimed a stunning 5 - 3 victory at the @entity14			1
@entity1 took to @entity15 to respond to the criticism of @entity3 after they lost to @entity10 @entity1 ( centre ) lost his temper with his team - mates during their embarassing defeat at @entity10 @entity21 ( left ) was another team - mate to be on the receiving end of @entity1 's outburst during the 5 - 3 loss the 28 - year - old was appointed @entity3 captain at the start of the season by @entity6 @entity3 stand 12th in the @entity29 after five matches , already eight points behind leaders @entity33			1
expectations of a major improvement after last season 's seventh - placed finish have been formed on the basis of the appointment of the experienced @entity40 and the recruitment of players including @entity43 , @entity21 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			2
and @entity1 is convinced the blossoming of the team will materialise , taking issue with those doubting @entity3 's ability to respond to their current frustration			1
@entity1 wrote on his @entity15 page : ' there seems to be a lot of people who have written us off because of sunday 's result but i do n't see it that way			1
' when i look around our dressing room and see the quality we have and the manager 's unbelievable attention to detail i have no doubts this team will be successful			1
' earlier , former @entity3 defender @entity71 predicted this summer 's big spending would need to be repeated in future transfer windows before the club can again be seen as title contenders			2
the @entity77 striker has praised new boss @entity40 ( centre ) for his ' unbelievable attention to detail ' the @entity11 ' threadbare defence will be further weakened by the absence of @entity83 , who is out for a month with an ankle injury defenders like @entity86 ( right ) have struggled for @entity3 this season , with the team leaking goals @entity3 have struggled in central defence this season as @entity86 , @entity92 and @entity83 battle for form and fitness and youngster @entity96 seeks to establish himself			1
and @entity71 believes that is the biggest issue still to be addressed			0
' i know @entity3 have spent £ 150million , ' @entity71 told @entity100 5 live			2
' i think there 's another two transfer windows of similar amounts of money needed - maybe £ 100million - before they can even think about winning the title			2
' there are still key positions in the team that need filling			0
i think the centre - back position is obviously the key area			0
holding midfield or centre midfield needs addressing too			0
' there were no world - class centre - backs out there ( this summer )			0
i think that 's why in the next two transfer windows , @entity3 might still be looking for that world - class defender			2
' however , he backed @entity77 internationals @entity92 and @entity86 to eventually prove their worth to the club			0
' i am certain @entity86 will come good and i have full faith in @entity92 as well , ' @entity71 said			0
' they 've bought of a lot of foreign players , you do n't get rid of your @entity131 spine			0
' like our @entity3 facebook page .			0
