by @entity0 @entity0 ' @entity1 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			1
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
in this week ’s column he gets behind beleaguered @entity11 , notes @entity12 is ready to get on that plane to @entity14 and reveals whose leg looks like a slice of stilton ! when your key players are missing as a manager , whether it 's in schoolboy football , pub football or at semi-professional level , you do n't win games			1
it 's as simple as that			1
emotionally that 's difficult for supporters to accept			1
hold tight : @entity11 was right to write off the @entity30 because he has a depleted squad at @entity32 i fully understand why @entity11 felt the need to write off the @entity30 game away at @entity36 and you would have to be mad to have expected any different result in the @entity40 semi-final first leg at the @entity41 against @entity42			1
the dogfight to avoid relegation will go right down to the wire			1
the compensation figure to pay off @entity11 and his staff will be better off spent trying to hook a few loan players to come to @entity32 to help strengthen their squad and save their season			1
he knows what he 's doing			1
timely boost : @entity53 made his first team return during the impressive win away at @entity56 on saturday think ! despite bad results recently , the compensation money to sack @entity11 is better spent on signings @entity42 smashed seven past @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 were hit for six , @entity60 and @entity61 conceded four and they played a half - strength team away to @entity66 – the @entity68 winners – and beat them 3 - 2			1
they taught @entity11 's @entity32 a lesson , too			1
it 's easy to say you should be doing this and you should be doing that , but the @entity42 players are faster , stronger , far superior technically			1
it looks like @entity76 has harmonised the expensive squad with calmness , confidence and a management style which is very different from @entity81			1
calmness personified : @entity76 's cool demeanour has settled the @entity42 squad down @entity12 is technically good enough to get into @entity86 's squad for the @entity14 @entity87 and mentally he looks to have the confidence and arrogance to make the step up to get on that plane			1
he showed that again with his well - taken goal to beat @entity93 on saturday			2
it looks like he believes he 's good enough and it looks like he believes he should be going			2
this mental hurdle is the most significant thing to overcome when you get to the top level			2
boy for @entity14 : @entity12 has produced a number of eye - catching performances for @entity104 cheers mum ! the playmaker scored against @entity93 and is in contention to go to the @entity87 the @entity109 cricket team have looked inferior in recent weeks and have been verbally beaten with barbed comments from @entity111 that have weakened their squad and dissolved self - belief			1
they fought to take the @entity115 back from us			2
@entity12 is fighting for his place , with that @entity111 spirit			1
@entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 – what do they all have in common ? none of them played football at a decent level but are making it as managers			1
they 've been to university , done this course and that course			2
back in my playing days if you did n't play at the top level , you had no chance			2
we 're laughing ! @entity119 and @entity122 are from the managerial breed who never made it playing not even @entity143 's penalty miss against @entity64			1
but i 'll tell you what , i 've got a lot of respect for @entity143 ( right )			2
my friend @entity149 asked me if i 'd seen the worst penalty ever shortly after it happened			2
he laughed as he explained that the penalty kick nearly hit the floodlights			2
i reminded him that @entity143 used to play at my old club @entity153 and had spells at @entity104 , @entity155 , @entity156 ; 11 clubs in total			2
and i also reminded him that in his time @entity143 had been in trouble with the law			2
he was arrested in connection with a robbery seven years ago – but not convicted – and used to hang around with a bad crowd			0
i admire @entity143 for not only turning his life around but also for maximising his undoubted ability , and for the courage and guts to take responsibility to grab that ball and take the penalty in the first place			0
my friend @entity149 just nodded in agreement			0
my old club @entity174 appointed a manager a few weeks ago who has never played professional football			0
@entity123 had been a trader in the @entity42 when he started work at the @entity180 academy coaching , training and developing the youngsters and bringing through some good young players			1
he moved to @entity174 to work as director of football operations for his friend and very wealthy owner @entity186			0
@entity186 has invested heavily throughout the club and in a few years ' time @entity174 will be playing in a brand new 20,000 - seater stadium in a prime location			0
@entity123 has just won @entity190 and got the record of six straight league wins - the best start of any @entity174 manager - and the team are flying at the top of the division			1
gone are the days that if you had 50 @entity109 caps you got a manager 's job			0
now , you need to be up to speed with strength and conditioning , in - depth match analysis , have excellent communication and man - management skills , be good at delegation , international recruitment , nutrition , counselling ... the list goes on and on and on			0
watch out for the rise of @entity174 and @entity123			0
new kid on the block : @entity174 are flying at the top of @entity190 with @entity123 in charge the players , supporters and owners of clubs at the bottom of @entity222 will be anxiously looking over their shoulders and scared stiff of the prospect of going to play in the @entity226 next year			0
it 's a good league , with lots of good professionals in it that have had to drop down with the influx of so many foreign players in the top leagues			0
to get out of it , you need a mixture of @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 – the @entity242 manager who is five points clear at the top			0
once you 're in it , do n't expect to come back too quick ! eyes down ! @entity247 caretaker @entity246 is trying to keep the struggling club in @entity222 i see in the news that @entity251 became the first @entity253 player to come out as gay last week			0
i do n't think anyone cares , in this day and age , about homosexuality			0
who is seriously bothered about it ? no one is nowadays			0
it 's all part of life and the world we live in			0
who cares ? @entity251 came out as gay last week but modern society is beyond such prejudices i now have the time to try to lose some weight and to help in my quest i joined the local gym			0
i enrolled myself into a fitness class for a 10 o'clock start last wednesday morning to do yoga			0
i thought yoga was just stretching to improve flexibility and mobility , but as i lay there doing my utmost to loosen my hamstrings i could n’t help but notice the lady next to me had a stilton leg – there were blue veins all over it			0
she managed to stretch her hamstring , by pulling her straightened leg all the way back over her head , but i could n't stop thinking how much it looked like a block of stilton cheese			0
i was sweating , a little bit embarrassed and , as i kept staring at the blue veins , knew it was about time i got myself into shape .			0
