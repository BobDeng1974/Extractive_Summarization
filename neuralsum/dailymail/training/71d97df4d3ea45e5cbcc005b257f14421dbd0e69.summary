the hunt for the missing @entity2 plane took an extraordinary twist last night when @entity4 said it may have detected a signal from its black box recorder on the floor of the @entity8			1
the faint signal was picked up by a @entity4 search vessel on the twenty - ninth day of the hunt for @entity12 , just hours before the recorder ’s batteries were expected to die			2
@entity4 ’s state - run news agency said the search vessel @entity17 01 picked up the signal on the precise frequency used by black box recorders in a search zone hundreds of miles off the west coast of @entity23			1
a @entity4 ship is said to have detected a ' pulse signal ' in the southern @entity8 today a white floating object spotted by @entity4 air force in the southern @entity8 today the signal was detected using a black box detector – a remote - controlled missile - shaped submersible – at around 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude , according to a @entity4 journalist on board the ship			1
the signal was picked up for only 90 seconds , suggesting , remarkably , that if it did come from the plane ’s black box recorder it may have been the final output before the battery died at the end of its 30 - day life			2
later , the @entity43 news agency said a @entity4 airforce plane had spotted ‘ several white objects ’ floating on the surface of the ocean 1,680 miles from @entity48 at 11.05am yesterday			0
the debris was just 55 miles from the area where the ping was detected			0
a huge underwater search was expected to be launched at daylight to see if the ship has found the @entity55 , which disappeared less than an hour into a flight from @entity57 to @entity58 on march 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board			1
@entity63 ’s @entity62 – carrying sophisticated equipment that can hear the recorder ’s pings – has joined the hunt and robot submersibles from an @entity23 search team are expected to be sent down where the ocean is up to two miles deep			0
an 11 - strong international flotilla is searching a vast area of the southern @entity8 for the plane			0
to hear the black box signals the @entity4 ship would have needed to be almost directly above the shoebox - sized black box , which was housed in the plane ’s tail section			1
the discovery would be unprecedented as black box recorders have only ever been found after a field of debris was detected first			2
the potential discovery came as @entity85 vowed it would not give up on trying to find the missing jetliner and announced details of a multinational investigation team to solve the aviation mystery , as the search for the plane entered its fifth week @entity92 , ( right ) @entity85 's defense minister and acting transport minister , told reporters in @entity57 that the cost of mounting the search was immaterial compared to providing solace for the families of those on board by establishing what happened @entity85 and @entity23 , which is in charge of the @entity8 search , greeted the news with cautious optimism last night but advised people to wait for developments , anxious that it could turn out to be another false lead			2
in the first week after the plane disappeared , @entity4 announced through @entity43 that it had satellite images of what might be debris from the missing flight in the @entity116 , only to claim later the data had been put out in error			0
@entity4 informed @entity23 officials about the black box signals at lunchtime on saturday before breaking ranks to announce the discovery shortly after @entity85 officials told journalists at a daily briefing that there had been no new developments in the search			1
teams are searching for two black boxes like this one which investigators hope will reveal what happened on board the doomed flight @entity139 captain @entity138 with the pinger locator which has now reached the remote search area in the @entity8 where investigators hope it will pick up a signal from @entity12 's black boxes clinging to hope : a underwater pinger locator ( above ) which is capable of detecting signals from @entity12 's black boxes has reached the search zone in the @entity8 on board the @entity23 navy ship @entity151 a @entity154 @entity153 crew member looks out for debris from the @entity2 plane a government source in @entity57 said : ‘ we sincerely hope the black box recorder has been found but our main concern is for the relatives of those missing , and we feel the way the @entity4 government has announced this is not appropriate			1
it smacks of one - upmanship			0
’ @entity4 nationals account for 157 of the passengers on the plane			0
if debris or the black box can not be found , the only hope for finding the plane may be a full survey of the @entity8 floor , an operation that would take years .			0
