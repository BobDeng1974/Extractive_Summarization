she once loved him and treated him to toys and trips to the seaside , yet in a case that has shocked the nation , four - year - old @entity6 ’s mother ended up killing him , after months of appalling abuse			1
@entity6 ’s aunt , @entity10 , is still trying to comprehend how her older sister @entity11 , with lover @entity6 , could have starved , tortured and beaten @entity6 to death			1
and as the evil pair begin a life sentence in jail , she is still blaming herself for not realising the danger @entity6 was in			1
the mother who tortured him : 27 - year - old @entity19 locked her son @entity6 , 4 in a room and systematically starved him			1
her sister @entity22 said she was once a good mother ' @entity23 and wretched ' : the judge who gave @entity6 's mother @entity6 , 27 , and his stepfather @entity6 , 34 ( left ) life sentences said the scale of his suffering was horrific ‘ i blame myself – i wish i had asked more questions and discovered the truth , ’ she told @entity30			1
‘ then @entity6 might still be alive today			1
’ @entity22 , who was @entity6 ’s only other adult blood relative in the @entity34 , said her sister had been a normal mother before she met @entity6			1
‘ when @entity36 was pregnant with @entity6 , she behaved like any other expectant mother , ’ @entity22 said			1
‘ i saw them often when @entity6 was little and i am sure she loved him			1
‘ she bought him toys and they went on trips with the whole family			0
once they went to the seaside in @entity44 and another time to a theme park near @entity46			0
' we were in and out of each other ’s houses all the time			0
she had problems with alcohol but that did n’t seem to stop her being a normal mother			0
’ @entity22 , 24 , continued : ‘ @entity6 was a lovely little boy			1
he seemed healthy and happy			0
it all stopped when she met @entity6 and gave birth to his child			1
' the other siblings were treated ok but @entity6 was a bit different			1
perhaps that is why @entity6 took against him			1
’ guilt : @entity22 said the family was happy before her sister met @entity6			1
she said she blames herself for not realising the danger @entity6 was in @entity6 weighed just 1st 9lbs when he died in march last year			1
during his final months , his mother and her lover starved him , forced him to perform punishment exercises , locked him in a tiny room , poisoned him with salt and held him under cold water until he lost consciousness			0
as the authorities in @entity46 investigate whether more could have been done to save @entity6 , it has emerged that teachers at his school , @entity46 ’s @entity74 , were offered counselling			1
at school , the starving boy scavenged in bins , scoffed birthday cake and filled his pockets with fruit from his class ’ communal bowl but teachers believed his mother ’s lie that he had an eating disorder			0
now @entity22 wants to know why social workers , police and teachers missed so many opportunities to save him			0
three weeks before he died , the starving boy , wearing just his underpants , stood in front of consultant paediatrician dr @entity93			0
he might have saved him had he acted , but instead he prescribed worming tablets and referred him for another appointment			0
dr @entity93 was yesterday unavailable for comment			0
@entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , said he and his family had gone to @entity102 for a short break			0

@entity22 , who lives near her sister ’s former family home in @entity46 , helped secure the convictions by giving evidence for the prosecution			2
despite that , she has been ostracised by some of the city ’s 30,000 - strong @entity115 community and her house has been attacked , forcing the family to move to a secret address			2
in an emotional interview , @entity22 said she had cut herself off from her sister and would not visit her in prison			1
she blames the couple entirely for @entity6 ’s death and is amazed that school staff , doctors and child protection experts accepted their assurances that @entity6 was not being mistreated			1
she also claims social workers accused her of having known he was being starved and beaten – something she fervently denies			0
‘ please do n’t misunderstand me , ’ she said			0
‘ i hold @entity6 directly responsible for killing @entity6			1
and i hold my sister responsible for failing in her maternal duty to protect her child			2
' i also blame myself			0
i wish i had asked more questions and discovered the truth			2
then @entity6 might still be alive today			2
life imprisonment : @entity10 , left , and @entity6 , right , systematically starved @entity6 , poisoned him with salt and subjected him to water torture murdered schoolboy : @entity6 died severely malnourished after being starved in the months leading up to his death by his mother and stepfather , who the judge said showed ' no remorse ' ‘ they lied to me just like they lied to the council and the police			1
but all those professional people who called at their home knew there was a small child in there			2
they knew @entity6 was a violent drunk who beat up @entity36			2
i ca n’t understand why @entity6 was allowed to remain in the house			2
’ @entity22 , who is doing a college course in maths and @entity161 and hopes to find a job as a classroom teaching assistant , has two young children who attend local schools			0
‘ at my daughter ’s school it has to be written down in a special book if a pupil even grazes their knee			0
but @entity6 was tortured and no one in authority seems to have done anything about it or even noticed			2
’ @entity22 said she had tried to persuade her sister to leave @entity6			1
‘ i often told @entity36 that she and @entity6 should come and live with me because i knew @entity6 was violent towards her			2
but she was frightened at what he might do if she moved out			0
’ between august and december 2010 , the police twice notified @entity181 that officers had been to the house following reports of domestic abuse			0
under lock and key : @entity6 was left in a box room in the family 's @entity46 home with nothing more than a dirty mattress to sleep on imprisoned : the door on @entity6 's room had been tampered with so his siblings could not let him out in january 2011 , @entity6 broke @entity6 ’s arm in a violent assault but claimed the boy had fallen off a sofa			1

no funeral has taken place yet because of the police investigation			0
@entity22 said : ‘ my family want the body to be sent back to @entity115			0
but i would like him to be buried here			0
he was born in @entity34 and this is where he should have grown up			2
’ @entity6 ’s two siblings , who can not be identified for legal reasons , are in the care of fostering and adoption agencies			2
child protection expert dr @entity93 was criticised during the trial for failing to spot @entity6 ’s malnutrition three weeks before he died			1
the little boy had initially been referred to the consultant paediatrician by a school nurse on october 10 , after @entity10 told her that @entity6 had an ‘ excessive appetite ’ and would punch her when not allowed food			1
after a number of missed appointments , the expert finally got to examine @entity6 on february 10 , 2012			2
dr @entity93 , who looked at the boy in his underpants , confirmed that his body mass index had almost fallen off the measurable scale but decided to prescribe worming tablets and refer him for further investigation			0
at his post-mortem three weeks later , @entity6 weighed only 1st 9lb and he was covered in 23 separate injuries			2
professor @entity250 , an expert in child malnutrition , told the court that his condition represented a campaign of sustained starvation that would have lasted for months			0
he said : ‘ @entity256 would have been present when he saw dr @entity93 – either he did not observe accurately or there was a dramatic change in the three weeks before death or both			0

@entity10 was four - year - old @entity6 's only adult relative in the @entity34 but did **n't** intervene in his abuse
