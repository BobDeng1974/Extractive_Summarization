the secret to everlasting life may have been found , if this 19th century ‘ miracle cure ’ proves to be the real deal			1
in may , archaeologists found bottles beneath a hotel construction site in @entity7 that once contained medicinal remedies			1
one of these , called the ' @entity9 ' was once believed to be capable of cheating death , and the team are now preparing to make it and try the miracle cure for themselves			1
a team of archaeologists is to recreate a liquid concoction once used for medicinal purposes			2
@entity18 claim a remedy known as the @entity9 was believed to have once been stored in a glass vial ( pictured ) , which was found beneath a construction site in @entity7 the find of hundreds of bottles detailing drinking and eating habits from 150 years ago was made during an excavation under the construction site in @entity27 , @entity7			1
ingredients aloes - 0.46 ounces ( 13 grams ) rhubarb - 0.08 ounces ( 2.3 grams ) @entity30 - 0.08 ounces ( 2.3 grams ) @entity31 ( also known as white turmeric ) - 0.08 ounces ( 2.3 grams ) @entity34 saffron - 0.08 ounces ( 2.3 grams ) water - four fluid ounces ( 114 millilitres ) grain alcohol ( vodka , gin ) - 12 fluid ounces ( 240 millilitres ) method squeeze out the liquid from the aloes			1
crush the rhubarb , gentian and saffron together and then mix them with the aloe liquid			0
then let the mixture sit for three days but shake it every so often			0
it will then need to be filtered before it can be served			0
the site had previously been a @entity53 beer garden and music hall established in 1858 called the @entity55			2
one of the bottles found was a small greenish bottle that , upon closer inspection , seemed to have once contained a drink intended to grant the consumer a longer life			1
the team behind the find at @entity18 decided to find out for themselves what exactly the drink was			2
they tracked down the recipe from a medical guide and found it contained ingredients still in use today			2
‘ we decided to engage in our own brand of experimental archaeology , ’ president of @entity73 told @entity74			0
‘ we wanted to know what this stuff actually tasted like			0
’ the drink itself contains a few herbs and a lot of alcohol , with the team suggesting it is best to drink it one drop at a time rather than in gulps			2
a second drink , known as dr @entity90 , another popular medicine used to apparently cure ailments , was also unearthed			2
this contains gentian root , orange peel , cinnamon , anise , coriander seed , cardamom seed , peruvian bark , gum kino , grain alcohol , water and sugar			0
the team are planning to recreate both drinks in the coming weeks - although they ’ve also released recipes for both so that people can make the cocktails themselves			1

the ingredients include rhubarb ( left ) and aloes ( right ) , with some of the ingredients perhaps surprisingly still in use today - although not in so - called miracle cures a second bottle once containing a drink known as dr @entity90 , another popular medicine used to apparently cure ailments , was also unearthed ( pictured )			1
it is a bit harder to make , though , with ingredients including peruvian bark and gum kino such miracle concoctions were apparently quite common in the 19th century and they were often found in bars			1
‘ long before the @entity149 [ @entity149 ] was formed , doctors and chemists of the late 19th century invented a number of interesting concoctions to treat common ailments , ’ @entity73 wrote on their blog			0
‘ bottled in glass and given almost comical names , they were sold at neighbourhood apothecaries			0
‘ practicing our own brand of experimental archaeology , we ’ve decided to recreate the past based on medicine bottles we recently found at an archeological site			2
‘ we ’re excited that we ’ve tracked down actual recipes for an “ @entity9 ” and “ @entity163 ” to match up with labels on our old bottles			0
‘ since both formulas required copious amounts of alcohol as a medium , it may have been difficult for consumers to determine whether the ‘ active ingredients ’ were actually effective			1
‘ the team also added that , perhaps surprisingly , many of the ingredients are still used today			0
‘ @entity30 , for example , is still used to stimulate appetite and treat gastric complaints and jaundice			0
’ @entity180 , meanwhile , is believed to reduce blood - sugar levels , while aloe is popular for treating burns says the team			0
‘ we ’re not expecting the results of our experiment to extend life expectancy or threaten the modern gastroenterologist ’s salary range , ’ they add , ‘ but at least we ’ll show off our chemistry prowess and relive the meticulous work and interesting fragrances of yesteryear ’s snake oil industry			0

archaeologists are to recreate a drink once found in a 150 - year - old bottle
it was dug up with 100s of others beneath a construction site in @entity7
called @entity207 of @entity208 , the drink was *classed* as a ' miracle cure ' and believed to be capable of helping people cheat death
the drink contained various herbs and copious amounts of alcohol
@entity18 has released the ingredients to make the drink
