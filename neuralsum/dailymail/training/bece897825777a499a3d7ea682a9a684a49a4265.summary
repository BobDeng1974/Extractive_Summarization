' nonsense : @entity36 went off on a rambling rant where she talked about how important the number of @entity47 followers was to her ego internet sensation : @entity68 hostess @entity2 has become famous after her provocative reactions at an @entity14 game were caught on camera just making some adjustments : her name is @entity2 and her list of credits includes stints as a host on off - roading , football and hockey shows as well as some small acting roles -- but her performance at the @entity83 has sent her fame quotient through the roof friday 's game will presumably involve more primping in front of tv cameras at the game			1

her low - cut top and the cameraman 's fixed stare helped out , as well			1
meanwhile , @entity36 has quickly moved to capitalize on her sudden fame by retweeting some of the more flattering screen grabs and compliments on @entity47 from her new fans			1
