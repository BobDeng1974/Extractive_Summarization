@entity0 and @entity1 have dismissed suggestions by @entity3 that @entity5 referees have an @entity7 agenda			1
@entity3 claimed there is a ‘ conspiracy ’ against his @entity5 leaders after @entity11 was booked for diving when his manager thought he should have been awarded a penalty in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity16 on sunday			1
@entity16 boss @entity0 now accepts that referee @entity17 should have awarded a spot - kick for @entity20 ’s challenge on @entity11 , but claimed it was the sort of mistake all clubs have to cope with over the course of a season			1
asked for his thoughts on @entity3 ’s controversial claims , @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s his feeling , i ca n’t say anything about that , but i do n’t think so			1
i think referees are human people , everybody makes mistakes			1
‘ and i think at the end of the season it ’s a little bit in balance			2
i do n’t think teams are more punished by the referee than the rest of the teams			2
it was a bad mistake from the referee , because when i watched the game afterwards it was a 100 per cent penalty			0
but sometimes you get a penalty and sometimes you do n’t , that ’s part of the job			0
’ as @entity37 boss @entity1 prepared for his side 's game against @entity65 , he said : ‘ i do n’t want to talk about what other managers say because i do n’t know what happens in every game			1
maybe as a manager we only know what happens against our team			0
all teams have difficult moments with referees			2
@entity3 shows his frustration as @entity11 is fouled against @entity16 ' all teams drop points because of referees making mistakes			1
the first goal by @entity81 against us on sunday was offside			0
' it ’s normal and i do n’t have any doubt about the way the referees whistle every game			2
i trust absolutely in the way they do it			0
’ @entity1 and @entity3 have never got on since becoming rivals in @entity92			1
the ill - feeling has only intensified since they came to @entity95			0
the city manager served a @entity98 touchline ban for criticising an official last year , but he added : ‘ after the game is not the best moment to talk about decisions , particularly if you have not won			0
it ’s a difficult profession , refereeing			0
