a @entity1 doorman says he 's been fired for being too good at his job			1
@entity3 , up until march 29 , manned the front desk of the luxury 27 on 27th building in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the 41 - year - old told the @entity10 he ' gave his life ' for his wealthy tenants and would go out of his way to do any personal tasks they asked -- all while keeping a cheerful smile on his face			1
but that willingness to go above and beyond for tenants -- by taking care of pets and watering plants , among other chores -- did n't sit well with the 2 - year - old building 's management , @entity17 says			1
' they said , ' we know you did it for the right reasons , but unfortunately ... you 're too nice to the tenants , '' he told the @entity10			0
too nice ? @entity8 doorman @entity3 was a smiling fixture in the lobby of the luxury 27 on 27th building in @entity7 , but was fired for , according to him , being too nice when @entity17 insisted he only did what was asked of him , he says his employers with @entity38 said it did n't matter			1
' unfortunately , in this case , nice guys finish last , ' body says his higher - up told him			2
according to the @entity10 , the tenants who so adored @entity17 have now taken up his cause with a petition to get him reinstated to his job			0
' most tenants , especially those who have lived in the building since it opened , can attest to @entity3 's kindness and eagerness to make people feel safe and welcome , ' the petition reads			1
' the ruthlessness of @entity3 's termination is disgusting , unjust , and disheartening			2
from day one , @entity3 has gone above and beyond his duties			0
yes , rules and regulations must be followed , but @entity58 is more than capable of providing coaching and counseling to ensure the best possible outcome for its tenants and staff			0
' management company @entity38 says @entity17 broke the rules			0
body says he only did what was asked of him , like cleaning cat litter , taking care of pets and watering plants the petition , on ipetitions.com , had received 72 of its goal of 250 signatures by sunday evening			0
now he waits , though @entity17 could soon get a new job through his staffing company @entity78			0
most tenants in @entity17 's corner blame the building management and not the staffing company for the concierge 's termination			1
but @entity58 , in an email sent to tenants , says that 's not the case			0
' it was recently brought to our attention that @entity3 did not follow @entity78 's policies and procedures and after being spoken to several times , it was their decision to reassign him to another building , ' says the letter , which was obtained by the @entity10 .			2

@entity3 was once a *beloved* figure at the front desk of the building 27 on 27th in @entity8
the concierge says he was fired last week and now *believes* it was because he was too willing to help affluent tenants -- even after his *shifts*
some tenants are *gathering* signatures to get 41 - year - old body reinstated as the building 's ever - *effervescent* doorman
