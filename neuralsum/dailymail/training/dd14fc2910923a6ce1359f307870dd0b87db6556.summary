he was screaming , “ no more cold water , @entity41 , no more cold water ! ” ‘ i had n’t factored in how hard it is to swim in a life jacket , so we did n’t move very far , but just far enough to save both our lives			0
when the boat came around a second time , we were just outside the circle , and i felt the hull hit my chest – but what i did n’t feel was the propeller cutting my leg			0
