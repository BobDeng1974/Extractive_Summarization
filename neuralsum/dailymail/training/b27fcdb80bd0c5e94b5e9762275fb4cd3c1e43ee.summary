the switch would have cost employees who left mid-year and even those who stayed , since they would not see the benefits of compounding in their retirement accounts , @entity47 reported			0
when the embattled chief tried to explain the controversial plan during an employee meeting on thursday , he made matters worse			2
@entity7 told a story about two women covered by @entity5 who had complicated pregnancies , forcing the company to shell out $ 2 million ' above and beyond ' what was necessary			1
he said , with @entity66 potentially adding $ 7.1 million to @entity5 's costs in addition to the ' distressed babies ' , the company needed to find cost savings elsewhere and was forced to change 401 ( k ) to protect itself			1
@entity7 reportedly earned $ 12m in 2012			2
the comments caused a publicity storm , with employees sending letters to @entity7 , and @entity26 giving it big coverage			1
@entity11 told @entity21 she was appalled at @entity7 's ' implication that somehow we were greedy consumers of health care benefits			1
' big wigs : @entity25 executive business editor at @entity5 - owned @entity26 , holding his son and speaking with @entity85 writer : @entity11 is the author of 2010 novel , ' a thread of @entity89 ' as a result of the outcry , @entity7 yesterday apologized and agreed to restore the original 401 ( k ) policy			1
' the leadership team and i listened to your feedback over the last week			0
we heard you on this topic , ' he wrote in an email to employees , according to @entity101			0
' and as we discussed the matter over several days , with management and employees , we have decided to change the policy back to a per - pay - period matching contribution			1
' however for @entity11 , author of 2010 bestseller ' a thread of @entity89 ' , ' the damage to my family had already been done '			2
the mother - of - two wrote a heartbreaking first - person article for @entity113 in which she recounted the painful birth of her now one - year - old daughter and reprimanded @entity7 for his thoughtless comments			1
' i take issue with how he reduced my daughter to a ' distressed baby ' who cost the company too much money			2
how he blamed the saving of her life for his decision to scale back employee benefits , ' she wrote			0
' how he exposed the most searing experience of our lives , one that my husband and i still struggle to discuss with anyone but each other , for no other purpose than an absurd justification for corporate cost - cutting ...			0
' our daughter has already overcome more setbacks than most of us have endured in the span of our lives			0
having her very existence used as a scapegoat for cutting corporate benefits was one indignity too many			0
' backpedaling : @entity5 chief @entity7 yesterday scuttled a plan to delay company contributions to employee retirement accounts and apologized for singling out two families for rising costs in the harrowing piece , @entity11 explained how her little girl was born prematurely on october 9 , 2012 , with reddish - purple skin , bloody and bruised all over			1
' one doctor , visibly shaken , described it as ' gelatinous ' , ' she wrote			0
' i could n’t hold my daughter or nurse her or hear her cries , which were silenced by the ventilator			0
without it , she could n’t breathe			0
' doctors told the couple their daughter might not survive one month or one week or one day			0
she also had at least a one - third chance of being severely disabled			0
in the toughest months , the little girl suffered a brain hemorrhage , her right lung collapsed and one morning , she stopped breathing altogether			0
she spent three months in the @entity165 , enduring blood transfusions , head ultrasounds , the insertion of breathing tubes , feeding tubes , and a central line extending nearly to her heart			1
' because the day of her birth was the furthest thing from a happy event , because so many of her first days were lived under the specter of death , i ’ve never had the luxury of taking her presence for granted , ' @entity11 wrote for @entity113			0
' it can be a struggle to set aside my lingering trauma amid the daily realities of coordinating her care to simply celebrate the fierce , beautiful girl who has completed our family			0
' all of which made the implication from @entity7 that the saving of her life was an extravagant option , an oversize burden on the company bottom line , feel like a cruel violation , no less brutal for the ludicrousness of his contention			2
