support : @entity1 , now 10 , with his mother @entity2 like most boys , he always preferred football to dolls			1
but @entity1 started life as a girl – and knew from the age of three that he had been born into the wrong body			1
christened @entity10 , he would shun traditional girls ’ toys in favour of kicking a ball around			0
by four , he refused to wear dresses – and at six he wanted his hair cut short and developed a boyish awkwardness around girls			1
by nine , he had finally broken the truth to his mother @entity2 , 37 , telling her : ‘ i ’m really a boy			2
’ now , at the age of ten , @entity1 is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty to stop him developing into a woman			1
miss @entity24 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , said : ‘ as a toddler , @entity1 only wanted to play ball			1
as a girl , he had no interest in any dolls and made a beeline for boy ’s toys			2
‘ and as soon as he began school , he only wanted to wear trousers as the other boys did			1
soon after , i noticed he went red whenever girls were around			0
’ @entity1 is not alone in facing gender problems			2
the number of transgender referrals to the @entity42 for children under 11 has quadrupled since 2009			2
like many parents in her situation , miss @entity24 had never heard of children facing such issues			0
but the single mother , who runs a health juice business , said @entity1 had ‘ amazing support ’ from his primary school			1
he was given counselling when his schoolwork started to suffer , and later decided to confront the issue head - on			0
‘ they were the ones who suggested @entity1 should have counselling , ’ she said			2
‘ then when he came out as transgender , they sent a letter out to all the parents in his year to explain he now wanted to be referred to as a boy			1
‘ staff then held a special lesson for all the year to explain about being transgender			2
and now they are even in the process of building unisex toilets to make life easier for @entity1 and other children like him			2
’ @entity10 pretty in pink , aged four , pictured left , and dressing up as a pirate , at five , pictured right when @entity1 was born there was no outward sign he was anything other than female			1
miss @entity24 , who also has a daughter @entity83 , 16 , from a previous relationship , said : ‘ as a toddler i usually put @entity10 in dresses and bought her lots of dolls			0
meanwhile , as her blonde hair grew , i put in pigtails			0
it simply never occurred to me she would n’t be as feminine as her sister			0
’ she added : ‘ looking back @entity1 knew then he was a boy			1
he had no interest in dolls , preferring to play with a football			0
and when we were out he ’d head straight for the boy ’s section in shops , asking for @entity99 toys			0
’ at seven , @entity1 wanted his hair cut shorter			1
but his grades started suffering and he was later given counselling at school			0
within a few weeks , his behaviour and schoolwork improved and last year he officially became transgender after telling his mother one morning			0
@entity1 is now happy in his skin at last and is now set to undergo hormone treatment meanwhile , his grades immediately improved			1
‘ once people stopped referring to @entity1 as a girl and he could just be the little boy he wanted , he was so much happier , ’ she said			1
@entity1 is now set to have hormone treatment to curb puberty			1
if at the age of 16 , he wants to complete the full transition to an adult man , he will be offered gender reassignment surgery			0
miss @entity24 added : ‘ there have been plenty of tears			0
it is hard to see your child going through such turmoil			0
but whatever happens i will always be there to support @entity1			2
‘ and right now it is just a wonderful relief to see him happy in his own skin at last			0

@entity1 knew from three that he had been born in the wrong body
by four he would *n't* wear dresses and by six he wanted to cut his hair short
@entity1 came out at school as a transgender and is now referred to as a boy
at age of 10 he is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty
