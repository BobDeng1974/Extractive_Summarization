@entity0 still regards @entity1 as his @entity3 hope despite bookmakers having saturday ’s @entity6 winner @entity5 shorter in the betting			1
@entity11 , sponsors of the @entity10 target run over three miles , make @entity5 the 7 - 1 second favourite behind defending champion more of that after his successful switch back to hurdling following a mixed foray into the novice chase arena			0
@entity5 received 4lb and beat @entity18 a neck at @entity10			0
@entity0 still regards @entity1 as his @entity3 hope despite bookmakers saying otherwise in contrast , @entity1 , a 10 - 1 shot , was beaten a head on level terms by the same rival in last month ’s @entity26 at @entity27 when he appeared to throw away victory when idling after jumping into the lead at the last flight			1
quoted of his website , @entity0 said : ‘ long term i still see @entity5 as a top - class chaser who could well be heading for the @entity34 in march next year			1
‘ first though comes the @entity3 in which we also run @entity1 , who is arguably our no 1 contender as he is more streetwise and has much more experience			1
‘ but @entity5 has a decent chance , too			2
there is plenty of improvement to come as i was a little worried that he might be a bit short of fitness going to @entity10 after a stop start campaign			0
the race will have brought him on and we know now that he stays the trip well			0
’ @entity5 is second favourite behind defending champion more of that meanwhile , @entity0 has entered @entity50 in this saturday ’s big race at @entity52 , the two - and - a - half mile grade one @entity54 ’ @entity53			1
the six - year - old , a winner at @entity27 last month , has already run twice at @entity52 , winning in november before finishing third to stablemare @entity56 in the grade one @entity57 ’ @entity53 over two miles			2
other entries for the @entity60 include @entity62 ’s @entity61 , last season ’s @entity64 ’ @entity6 winner who has not convinced with his jumping in his first two starts over fences			0
@entity69 has entered @entity70 , @entity71 put in @entity72 while @entity73 has three possibles including @entity75			0
@entity1 , ridden by @entity76 , jumps a fence in @entity78			2

@entity0 *believes* @entity1 is his best hope of @entity3 success
@entity83 will also enter @entity84 , who he says has a chance
he has entered @entity50 in saturday ’s big race at @entity52
