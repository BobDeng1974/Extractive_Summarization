by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the @entity3 reportedly has assigned nearly three - dozen detectives from various units to figure out who who scaled the @entity8 monday night and hoisted white flags above the @entity11 landmark			1
investigators have reportedly identified some of the suspects , but currently only know their nicknames , according to published reports			2
police believe that the flags were taken down and then replaced with bleached - white banners			1
officials called it a major security breach according to the @entity32 , the @entity3 has taken investigators from homicide , counter-terrorism , intel and transit units to find the culprits			2
the paper reports that detectives from @entity42 ’s @entity41 , @entity43 , @entity44 and 10th @entity45 also have been brought in for the investigation			0
' we have no good images of these guys on cameras			0
none of the footage captures the perpetrators of this crime , ' a police source said			0
the @entity3 is treating the prank as a serious security breach and many @entity11 are wondering how the culprits were able to slip past the police officers and surveillance cameras unnoticed at 3.30am			1
police believe that there were four or five thieves and that they worked in two teams - one for each bridge tower - to take down the flags			1
a video from @entity68 shows @entity3 officers taking down the defaced banner after scaling the bridge about 11am on tuesday			1
as the @entity32 reports , however , this is n't the first time that the @entity75 flags have gone missing from the bridge - one of @entity11 's most recognizable icons			2
in 2012 , thieves swiped the flags from both ends of the bridge , though the story never made it to the media , bridge painter @entity78 told the @entity32			2
the flags were replaced and the thieves have still never been caught			0
in 2004 , during the @entity87 in @entity11 , the flags were also stolen			0
@entity3 officials said that they believe the vandals may have been at the top of the bridge before			2
they tacked aluminum covers on the lights illuminating the flags , so that no one would notice the @entity24 had been taken down until daybreak			1
' for someone to go around it and go up to the tower and have right size cover to put over the light , there 's some indication of pre-operational planning , ' @entity3 deputy commissioner @entity97 said on tuesday			0
@entity107 video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am			1
the second tower went dark seven minutes later , indicating the heist was at least a two - person job			0
so far , the @entity3 has no clue who is behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they do n't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics			2
police promptly raised @entity75 flags back to their rightful place above the bridge - replacing the @entity24 that had been stolen it 's unclear how the vandals slipped past the police officers and security cameras guarding the bridge ' this may be somebody 's art project , or it may be an attempt at a statement , ' @entity97 said			1
several officers scaled the bridge and were seen lowering the flag on the @entity42 side around 11am tuesday as traffic inched along the bridge			1
the bridge is one of the most heavily secured landmarks in the city , constantly monitored by surveillance cameras			1
police patrol cars are also stationed at both ends of the bridge			2
detectives are reviewing security footage in an attempt to determine who put up the white flags - and how they gained access to the span			1
the support towers are 273 - feet tall and it 's unknown how the thieves managed to climb them without anyone noticing			0
@entity156 president @entity155 blasted the vandals who took the @entity75 flags			0
' if flying a white flag atop the @entity8 is someone ’s idea of a joke , i ’m not laughing , ' he told the @entity32			1
' the public safety of our city is of paramount importance , particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high - risk targets			0
we will not surrender our public safety to anyone , at any time			0
' in april , @entity11 artist @entity174 - aka @entity173 - scaled the @entity176 - @entity175 and planted an art installation at the top			0
he was later arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass .			0

vandals managed to slip unnoticed past police officers and surveillance cameras guarding the @entity8 early tuesday and install white flags
police say they know the nicknames of some the suspects
they *boarded* up the lights illuminating the flags so that nobody noticed the white banners until daybreak
@entity107 video of the bridge shows the lights above the towers went out at 3.35am and *3.42am*
detectives are working around the clock to find the culprits
