by @entity0 last updated at 7:32 pm on 13th november 2011 did she know ? @entity2 has been married to alleged child rapist @entity3 since the 1960s and the indictment says abuse took place in their home @entity3 ’s wife has been largely absent from the analysis of who knew what about her husband ’s alleged sexual abuse of eight boys over a 15 - year period			1
but @entity18 does make an appearance in the 23 - page @entity21 indictment which graphically details the charges against the 67 - year - old former @entity25 coach			0
mrs @entity2 , 68 , attempted to call one of the victims in the weeks leading up to his testimony , despite the fact the now 26 - year - old had cut off all contact with @entity2 two years prior			1
she left a message on @entity35 's phone saying the matter was ' very important ' but the man , who told the @entity21 that as a ten - year - old in 1994 , @entity2 hugged and inappropriately touched him , did not return the call			1
part of that alleged abuse took place in the @entity2 family ’s @entity43 , @entity45 , home , in which @entity2 and her husband raised their six adopted children			1
@entity2 claimed he and his wife could not have any of their own			1
over the years the couple became the parents to @entity55 , now 46 , a businessman living in @entity57 , @entity58 , 41 , former @entity60 player , and now a football coach at @entity62 , @entity63 , 38 , a @entity25 graduate , @entity65 , 35 , a @entity66 , and 33 - year - olds @entity67 , a @entity25 graduate and @entity70 , who is director of player personnel for the @entity72			1
quite how much any of them knew about the sexual abuse , which occurred between 1994 and 2009 with a number of incidents at the family home , is now under scrutiny			1
the former @entity25 defensive coordinator and his lawyer , @entity80 , have maintained that @entity2 is innocent and publicly denied all allegations			2
neither @entity2 nor any of her adopted children have yet made a statement on the scandal			1
handcuffed : eight young men have been identified as the targets of sexual advances or assaults by @entity2 from 1994 to 2009 , prosecutors said idyllic : authorities say @entity3 's home in @entity43 , @entity45 , was one of the places he sexually abused several boy @entity3 's book touched , which was released in 2001 the @entity21 indictment states that @entity2 selected his young victims from the ' @entity99 ' , a charity he started in 1977 devoted to helping troubled boys in the @entity43 area			1
mrs @entity2 helped out with the running of the programme			2
' after we had taken in some foster children , we saw the opportunities that some kids just had n't had , ' mrs @entity2 told @entity109 in 1982			2
' but we 'd gotten to the point where we could n't take in anymore , so @entity3 started thinking about starting a group home			0
' in his 2000 autobiography , ' touched : the @entity114 ' the onetime heir apparent to @entity116 devotes many pages to his relationships with boys he met through the @entity99			1
he also makes reference to his own children during an exchange with some of the boys from the charity			2
@entity2 wrote that one night he was talking to two @entity99 boys who had rebelled against their foster parents , with one boy telling how his foster father had ' grabbed me around the back of my shoulders and he made me do something when i did n't want to do it			1
' ' do you ever grab your kids like that ? ' the boy asked @entity2			2
' no , i do n't grab my kids like that , ' @entity2 answered			2
' i grab them like this			0
' he wrote : ' with that , i put my hands gently around their throat			0
' it was an apparent jest			0
' i could tell they were totally confused , ' @entity2 wrote			2
' both boys had a scared look in their eyes			0
' the book repeatedly described @entity2 hugging boys and detailing how he was very close to those he met through the charity			1
of the photos that line his office walls , he said : ' they are kids that have touched my life and have been a part of me for a long , long time			2
' in the book he paints himself as someone who would repeatedly take risks in the hunt for what he refers to as ' mischief			0
' ' i believe i live a good part of my life in a make - believe world , ' @entity2 wrote in one of the final chapters			1
' i enjoyed pretending as a kid , and i love doing the same as an adult with these kids			0
' whether mrs @entity2 was worried by any such behaviour is not yet known			2
what is established is that she has been by @entity2 ’s side since the mid- 1960s , when they married			1
originally from @entity180 , @entity181 , she had met @entity3 in @entity182 a few years before			0
he endearingly called his wife ' @entity185 , ' because she was in charge in their home , @entity183 reported			0
losers today : @entity25 narrowly lost their @entity191 college football game against @entity192 at the @entity193 in @entity43 , @entity45 today former leaders : @entity3 ( left ) was the defensive line coach under head coach @entity116 ( right ) before @entity2 retired in 1999 the shocking @entity21 indictment makes repeated accusations that victims were abused inside the couple ’s home			1
victim 1 spent many nights there sleeping in a basement bedroom			0
the report states that @entity2 would come down to the basement to check on him at bedtime			0
the report found that @entity2 ' indecently fondled @entity200 1 on a number of occasions , performed oral sex on victim 1 on a number of occasions and had victim 1 perform oral sex on him on at least one occasion			1
' phone records also confirm that @entity2 made 61 phone calls from his home phone to victim 1 's home phone between january 2008 and july 2009 despite @entity212 expressing a wish that he no longer wanted to see the football coach			1
the defensive coordinator also made 57 calls from his personal cell phone to victim 1 's home phone			0
heyday : @entity3 ( centre ) is a star in football circles as he is closely identified with the school 's reputation as a defensive powerhouse despite these actions , there is no suggestion whatsoever in the indictment that mrs @entity2 was aware of her husband 's sexual relations with @entity212 or any of the other seven victims			1
experts have suggested that she and her children could well have been kept in the dark			0
' [ abusers are ] very good at hiding it from everyone , ' clinical social worker @entity246 told @entity251			0
' very good at seducing the child and manipulating the child not to tell			0
' however , @entity246 , who counsels sexually abused children and teenagers at @entity256 , @entity181 and at @entity257 in @entity258 , adds : ' i 've seen it both ways , in which the family knows and is in denial			0
' meanwhile @entity43 police have reported that someone threw two cinder blocks through a bedroom window at @entity2 ’s house on thursday night			0
the news came as it emerged that the accused child rapist , who is out on bail , lives close to an elementary school and playground .			0

@entity2 called @entity200 7 before he gave evidence despite him cutting contact with former football coach two years prior
she was major part of @entity2 's life since meeting in 1960s and assisted with his ' @entity99 ' charity from which he ' selected his boys '
couple adopted five sons and one girl , who are now all adults
