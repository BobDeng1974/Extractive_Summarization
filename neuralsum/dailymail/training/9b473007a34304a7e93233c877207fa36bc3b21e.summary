@entity0 , 69 , died in may last year after suffering a cardiac arrest in hospital when staff failed to give him a blood transfusion a 69 - year - old man died in his hospital bed after doctors failed to give him a life - saving blood transfusion , despite ordering it five hours earlier			1
@entity0 , from @entity10 in @entity11 , was admitted to hospital on may 1 last year			2
he was quickly diagnosed as suffering a gastrointestinal bleed , a side effect of taking the blood - thinning drug , @entity16			1
an order was placed with @entity19 's blood bank for a transfusion , within one hour of mr @entity0 's admission to @entity22 at 4.55pm			1
but the decision was taken to delay the procedure , and transfer the 69 - year - old to the acute medical ward			2
the father - of - two arrived at the ward at 10.25pm , already suffering chest pains and heart palpitations , but an inquest heard he was neither monitored by a nurse , nor visited by a doctor			1
nearly three hours later , after being alone on the ward , the low volume of blood in his body triggered a cardiac arrest			2
dr @entity0 never regained consciousness and died seven days later on may 8 , after his life - support machine was switched off			2
the inquest heard dr @entity0 was being monitored for long - term treatment of @entity43 , a common condition which causes an irregular heart rhythm and affects around one in 20 adults over the age of 65			2
his condition was under regular review and was well controlled by the @entity16 medication			0
today , following the inquest into dr @entity0 's death on wednesday , his family called for lessons to be learned to prevent the same mistake being repeated			1
his wife @entity56 , 71 , said : ' we simply can not conceive how we could lose @entity0 so suddenly			0
' one day he is at home happy , fit and able , the next day on a life support machine			0
' to find out that he could have , and should have , easily survived leaves us devastated			0
' in our opinion , it is not down to a lack of systems			0
it is that the systems and protocols were wholesale ignored			0
' @entity0 was not failed by one member of staff - he was failed repeatedly by everyone who was responsible for his care			2
dr @entity0 , pictured with his wife @entity72 , was suffering a gastronintestinal bleed caused by medication he was taking			2
within an hour of being admitted doctors ordered a blood transfusion to replace the blood he had lost			1
but eight hours later he suffered a cardiac arrest , after medics failed to carry out the procedure ' i would like to thank the coroner for taking the time to investigate what happened to @entity0 - it has taken our family over a year of meetings , including insisting that the hospital issue a revised @entity90 to replace what we felt was a flawed one			1
' i hope lessons are learned to prevent this happening to others in future			0
' @entity97 , medical negligence expert at @entity99 , said dr @entity0 's family found it very difficult to hear the coroner rule his death was avoidable			1
she said : ' the past year has been horrendous for the family and for them to hear that @entity0 's death was completely avoidable has left them devastated once again			1
' the incident raises a number of issues which the @entity19 needs to ensure it addresses in terms of observations of patients and training for its staff so that the same thing can not happen in future			0
' @entity119 has carried out an internal investigation and made a number of recommendations in respect of treatment to be provided going forward , the family are keen to ensure that these recommendations are implemented			0
' the @entity19 , which runs @entity19 , pictured , admitted liability for dr @entity0 's death and has apologised to his family a spokesperson for @entity19 said : ' we accept the coroner 's findings and the conclusion of this inquest			1
' we are sincerely sorry for the circumstances surrounding dr @entity0 's death , and have already provided a full apology to his family			1
' an investigation was undertaken by the @entity19 and , following this , a number of changes have already been made to our processes within acute medicine			0
' as demand for our acute services increases we have an even greater responsibility to ensure that our systems and processes are resilient to these pressures and that they fully support our staff in delivering safer care			0
' we have reviewed the rotas to ensure that they better reflect our capacity and demand , and we have also reviewed staffing including the introduction of @entity156 onto the @entity157			0
' we have also introduced new measures to enable staff to assess and identify those patients that are most at risk			0
' these actions have been implemented since the outcome of the @entity19 's investigation following dr @entity0 's death , and will reduce the risk of another incident of this nature taking place			1
