by @entity0 published : 15:56 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 08:59 est , 25 august 2013 accused : @entity1 , allegedly listed his brother 's address as his home instead of his house in @entity6 two of @entity9 ’s controversial crime tsars face being stripped of their titles after being investigated for electoral fraud , which could trigger by - elections costing taxpayers as much as £ 3.6 million			1
the @entity14 can reveal that the police watchdog mounted covert operations after being tipped off that the @entity17 for @entity18 and @entity19 allegedly lied about where they lived			1
the two @entity21 could face prosecution for election fraud offences if the @entity24 decides they were not based inside their force area on polling day , as the law required			2
@entity1 is accused of listing his brother ’s house in @entity30 as his address when he really lives on the other side of @entity33 in @entity6 , and @entity34 is said to spend time in a @entity37 village with his vicar wife while having claimed he lived just outside @entity39			1
if both men were charged with breaching electoral legislation and then found guilty , they would be kicked out of their posts			2
both are independents with no political party backing , and neither has appointed a deputy so far , so local councillors would be forced to choose unelected members of the @entity50 ’ staff as temporary replacements , in what critics say would make a mockery of ministers ’ promise that the new crime tsars would improve police accountability			2
but then fresh elections would have to be held , at further cost to voters who for the most part ignored last year ’s nationwide poll			2
@entity64 , a consultant who monitors @entity66 ’ activity , said last night : ‘ this is a further unwelcome cost to the taxpayer			2
’ and @entity69 , who stood for @entity70 in @entity18 , added : ‘ the implications if a commissioner is found guilty of electoral fraud are that we will need to have another costly election the public do n’t want			1
’ the unprecedented allegations against the two politicians represent the deepest crisis yet for @entity21 , introduced just nine months ago in a £ 75 million nationwide poll that saw a record low turnout of just 15 per cent of voters			0
doubled - up : mr @entity1 has listed his brother 's house , left , in @entity30 as his home , but has allegedly been living in a housein @entity6 , right , for 20 years many commissioners have been accused of cronyism by giving well - paid roles to friends and political allies , while some have faced questions over their expenses			1
the @entity24 police watchdog has the power to look into allegations of potentially criminal misconduct against crime tsars , and the @entity50 in @entity18 and @entity19 are the first to face the possibility of criminal charges over their conduct at the time of the ballot			1
the law that introduced @entity21 – who have the power to set force budgets and strategies , as well to hire and fire chief constables – makes it clear that candidates must live in the police force area in which they stand			0
they had to be on the relevant electoral roll both on the day they were nominated and on polling day , november 15			0
the @entity116 said candidates were warned it is an offence to lie on their nomination forms , but no independent checks were made into the information given			0
mr @entity1 , a 72 - year - old barrister , listed his address in his election literature as being in the historic coastal town of @entity30 , within the @entity18 police area			1
but electoral roll and @entity128 records show his main home for more than 20 years has been 175 miles away in @entity6 , @entity130			1
the @entity30 house is owned by his brother and sister - in - law			1
wrong address ? @entity34 claims he lives at a @entity19 home but has been staying 115 miles away second homes probe : @entity137 has allegedly been living with his vicar wife in @entity140 , @entity37 earlier this summer the @entity24 was told that mr @entity1 , who earns £ 70,000 a year as @entity50 , had given a false address , and began a secret operation to investigate the homes without his knowledge			1
mr @entity1 declined to comment yesterday , despite repeated calls to his home , office , staff and his brother			1
meanwhile a similar accusation has been levelled at mr @entity34 , a former @entity151 councillor who won the @entity50 ballot in @entity19 as an independent and who is paid £ 85,000 a year			1
he has worked in the county for many years , previously owned a house there and gave his address as a house in the small town of @entity160 ’s @entity159			1
but he does not own it , although he has been staying there			0
mr @entity34 ’s wife , @entity163 , is a vicar in the @entity37 village of @entity140 , 115 miles away , and it has been alleged that he actually lives with her			1
a complaint was made to the @entity167 , which scrutinises the performance of @entity66 , and passed on to the @entity24			0
exposed : previous spotlight on crime tsars the @entity14 has led the way in exposing the waste of public money and questionable decisions made by @entity21			0
we revealed that many @entity21 were creating a ‘ gravy train ’ by giving posts to friends and political allies , and were also holding down second jobs in councils and businesses			0
@entity183 was forced to quit her £ 15,000 role as the first youth @entity50 after the @entity186 uncovered a series of offensive online comments			0
and @entity190 pcc @entity189 had to repay ‘ incorrectly claimed ’ travel expenses after our exposé			2
in another twist , the man mr @entity34 defeated to win the poll – former @entity196 mp @entity196 – is also under investigation for allegedly lying about his @entity198 have been looking into claims that mr mates , who famously gave a watch to disgraced tycoon @entity203 inscribed ‘ do n’t let the buggers get you down ’ , was living in @entity204 when he stood as @entity50			1
last night , mr @entity34 told @entity14 : ‘ i am content that i completed the nomination form correctly			2
there is an accusation which is being investigated by the @entity24			0
i am quite content that it is being investigated			0
’ once the @entity24 has completed its investigations , a senior commissioner will decide whether to pass the file to the @entity215			0
in the event that either mr @entity1 or mr @entity34 was charged with election fraud and convicted , they would be declared ineligible to be @entity21			1
the law states that if a @entity50 is ‘ incapacitated ’ , the local panel can choose a member of their staff as an ‘ acting commissioner ’			0
but the local election would then have to be held again			0
the 41 polls across @entity226 and @entity33 last year cost £ 75 million , so holding two again could cost as much as £ 3.6 million			0
an @entity24 spokesman confirmed it was investigating both @entity21 , adding : ‘ we have received a referral and are at the early stages of an investigation			0
we are unable to comment further at this stage			0
’ @entity232 , who stood as a for @entity70 in @entity19 , said : ‘ the cost of another election on the grounds of misconduct from the standing @entity50 would be hard to stomach			2
’ she added that it would nevertheless be wrong to appoint a member of the @entity50 ’s staff without any discussion .			2
