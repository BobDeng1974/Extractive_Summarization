they might have spent the last two weeks in a £ 14,000 @entity3 villa but , laden with bags and carrying their young son , the @entity0 and @entity1 looked very much like any other set of parents as they strode through @entity9 's tiny airport			1
the family was seen boarding a @entity12 plane as they prepared to travel back to @entity14 , following their annual holiday on the island of @entity17			1
@entity1 , who is almost seven months pregnant , and @entity18 were on the island to celebrate @entity21 's 60th birthday on the 31st january , as well as for a final family break before they become parents for a second time in april			1
@entity18 , meanwhile , got the job of carrying the hand luggage and clutched a £ 74.95 floral - print holdall from @entity41 as he made his way into the plane behind one of the couple 's two protection officers			1
the couple have spent the last two weeks at the @entity48 on the secluded island of @entity17 , with the @entity21 clan , including @entity51 , 27 , and @entity52 , 31			1
they were there for mrs @entity21 's birthday celebrations , which , according to sources , was fun , informal and noisy and included bespoke cocktails created especially for the event			1
along with @entity52 and @entity51 , rumoured guests included @entity60 , the owner of @entity17 's much - loved @entity62 , and the island 's resident doctor @entity63 and his wife @entity65			2
tired : @entity32 , who was carried by his mother , looked a little overtired long journey : the flying time back to @entity14 is around eight hours - a long time for a toddler like @entity32 @entity69 travel bag get a similar style in the sale for £ 50 ! visit site what a gentleman the @entity0 is			1
whilst we ca n't quite see what the @entity1 is wearing to fly home from their annual holiday on the island of @entity17 , luckily we can get a load of the couples ' luggage ! ask any parent and they 'll tell you that when travelling on a long haul flight with a one - year - old , only a bag of @entity90 proportions will do			1
and who better to turn to than cult brand @entity92 , whose vintage - inspired floral prints have got countless fans , including our favourite little prince ? we spotted @entity97 carrying a polka dot print @entity92 holdall when en route to @entity100 , plus of course the guardsman print tank top that gorgeous little @entity32 wore in his official @entity104 portrait was by the brand			2
we love the contrast stripe print strap on this style , as well as the perfectly sized pockets			0

also off the guest list was @entity51 ' girlfriend @entity131 , 35 , and @entity52 's boyfriend @entity132 , also 35 , who were dropped due to limited space at @entity48			0
the couple are heading back for the start of an intense period of engagements , beginning with the @entity1 's visit to @entity139 on thursday			0
32 - year - old @entity18 is currently studying for the pilot 's licence that will enable him to fly @entity144 aircraft when he joins the @entity145 this summer			0
although the prince is already qualified to fly a @entity148 , his new role requires five months of training , which he is currently completing , 14 exams and a flight test			0
break : the @entity153 have been enjoying a two - week break in @entity17 with the @entity21 clan celebration : the holiday also included a 60th birthday celebration for mrs @entity21 busy : @entity1 , who is almost seven months pregnant , will have a busy run of engagements on her return once qualified , he will be part of the team who fly day and night shifts and attend a variety of emergencies , ranging from road crashes to heart attacks			1
the @entity0 's new job will require him to spend more time in @entity172 , where he and the @entity1 have their new home , @entity175			1
with its sugar - sand beaches and gently swaying palms , it 's no surprise that the @entity3 has proved a hit with holidaying royalty			0
a particular favourite is @entity182 , which earlier this year saw princess @entity183 arrive on its shores for a break			0
part of the @entity189 , the island is one of four that make up the @entity192 , and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as @entity195 's , a beachside restaurant just outside the capital @entity198			0
‘ the @entity3 island of @entity182 is synonymous with the rich and famous , from @entity200 and @entity201 to @entity202 , ' says @entity204 acting travel editor , @entity203			0
favourite : princess @entity205 owned a home on @entity17 and spent much of her time there while celebrities are certainly seen here , it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot			2
‘ all of that makes it perfect for the royals , who can enjoy the island ’s relative privacy and lack of “ riff raff ” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach , ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere			0
' almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of @entity17 , which in january last year , was the scene of @entity32 's first ever trip abroad			2
while the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his @entity21 relatives and did so again this year , his great aunt @entity205 , another royal fond of a @entity17 break , sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island .			2
