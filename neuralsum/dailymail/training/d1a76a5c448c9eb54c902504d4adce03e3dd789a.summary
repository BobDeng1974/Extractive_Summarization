by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:41 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 02:51 est , 2 october 2013 a @entity3 soldier was killed by a @entity5 bomb after blundering @entity7 troops failed to discover the 80kg device buried in a road			1
sergeant @entity11 ’s unit was given the green light to travel down a ‘ high - risk ’ route in @entity14 after @entity7 forces insisted one hour earlier it was clear of improvised explosive devices ( @entity18 )			1
but the @entity20 squad which used hi - tech detector vehicles to check the dirt track had missed the huge bomb			2
hero : sgt @entity11 was killed by a roadside bomb in @entity14 last , leaving behind widow @entity26 , right , who was heavily pregnant at the time mother : @entity28 was left with the couple 's children after her husband 's death sgt @entity11 – who had been looking out of the vehicle ’s hatch – died when his armoured truck hit the huge ied and flipped onto its roof			1
his wife @entity28 was seven months pregnant with their third child at the time			1
an inquest criticised the specialist @entity7 engineers for giving ‘ inappropriate ’ advice to @entity3 commanders			1

sgt @entity11 , of the @entity49 , was on patrol in @entity51 , a @entity5 hotspot in @entity53 , on september 9 last year			1
he was part of a mission to push insurgents from an area of land between two military bases			0
the convoy set off down a dirt road when an @entity18 exploded under his 19 - tonne @entity63 armoured vehicle			2
sgt @entity11 , 32 , received severe injuries and died despite immediate medical assistance			1
the blast had been activated by insurgents using a command wire buried at least four inches below the ground and the cable stretched about 200 metres from the bomb crater to a firing point			0
in a written statement , a @entity20 officer – identified only as soldier 5 – said engineers drove along the route in vehicles with sensitive electronic equipment designed to detect buried ieds			1
crucially , he admitted @entity7 troops did not get out of their vehicles to carry out visual searches for disturbed ground or other signs insurgents had been there			2
lieutenant colonel @entity89 , a @entity91 ied expert , said the bomb had been hidden at a ‘ vulnerable position ’ in the road			0
he said it would have been ‘ prudent ’ for the @entity7 bomb detectors to dismount from their vehicles to search for wires and other danger signs			2
superior : major @entity101 gave evidence at the inquest today and said he made the decision to take the road in a vehicle based on intelligence , but would not have done if he knew what he does now lt col @entity89 told the coroner he would have recommended a ‘ methodical approach ’ to checking the road , involving soldiers on foot searching for buried bombs using hand - held detectors or sniffer dogs			1
he said : ‘ the route itself was sufficiently risky			0
they should have stopped and dismounted the vehicle			0
‘ if they had discovered the command wire and cut it they may have been able to remove that ied			0
’ he acknowledged searching for bombs on foot was ‘ very time - consuming ’ and could have ‘ delayed the mission ’			0
he added that the @entity7 had a ‘ different mindset ’ towards discovering ieds			2
happy couple : sgt @entity11 and his wife , @entity28 , on their wedding day held in 2011 , the year before he died magic moment : the couple kiss at the moment it was confirmed they were married at @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity141 major @entity142 , sgt @entity11 ’s commanding officer , said : ‘ i chose that route at the time because i thought it was the safest route , based on intelligence [ provided by the @entity7 ]			1
‘ the advice i got was to follow the route			0
i would have gone in on foot if i had known what i know now			0
i made the call wrongly , but i made it in good faith			1
’ comrades of @entity156 , of @entity140 , @entity141 , described how ‘ it went dark ’ in the @entity63 when the @entity18 exploded			2
sgt @entity11 was barely breathing and died before reaching @entity159 hospital			1
miss @entity45 said the @entity7 team had failed to provide proper risk advice			2
‘ there was a clear failure to enter into dialogue about how best to manage this risk , ’ she said			0
since the tragedy , @entity3 troops have been issued with new guidance on assessing routes			2
blast : sergeant @entity171 died after his @entity173 vehicle , similar to the one pictured , was hit while patrolling with the @entity175 in the @entity51 district of @entity53 province recording a verdict of unlawful killing , miss @entity45 also said the route had not been monitored around the clock by @entity183 troops – giving insurgents time to plant devices			1
after the inquest in @entity188 , mrs @entity186 said she and her three young children , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 , were ‘ so very proud ’ of the soldier – who was helping to train @entity14 police			0
in a statement she said : ‘ the questions that our family had have been answered			0
we are satisfied that everything possible was done to try and save @entity202 ’s life			0
' we all miss @entity202 and are so very proud of him			0
he lives on in his family but especially in his three children he leaves behind			0
’ sgt @entity11 was the 427th member of @entity3 forces to have died since operations in @entity14 began in 2001			1
