a sister has received offers from dozens of from potential suitors ... after her brother decided to place a ' commercial ' pleading for a date for her on @entity6 , @entity7 and the @entity9 website			1
@entity10 , 26 , decided it was about time his older sibling @entity12 got a boyfriend , so he posted a video about his sister online			1
' she has n't had a boyfriend for a long while , ' he says in the home - made clip , filmed in his car			0
' do n't know whether it 's because she 's infertile , she 's too old , whatever			0
' ' i 'm not going to go into that because she 'll kick off			0
' @entity10 and older sister @entity12 are close , working together running media company @entity29 @entity10 recorded a video of his sister which he posted online alongside an advert for a date with her although she admits she was originally cross with her brother , @entity12 now is enjoying sifting through the responses from men hoping to date her - having whittled it down to between five and eight suitors ' we need to get her a boyfriend because she 's doing my head in ! ' his unwitting sister then gets into the car , looking a tad taken aback when he explains what he 's doing			1
he then continues : ' if anyone 's interested , she 's 33 , she 's got her own car , runs her own business , she 's ... i 've run out of things to say about you			0
anyway , if you 're interested , add her on @entity6			0
' @entity10 put the video on @entity6 without his sister 's knowledge and then shared it on different sites such as @entity9 and @entity7			1
when @entity12 found out about the video she said ' at first i was shocked and kicked off but then i began to see the funny side and now i 'm thankful '			2
the fact it was an an instant success and sparked multiple responses in just 24 hours may have helped			0
' my laptop has not stopped beeping since , ' says @entity12			2
@entity12 scours the profiles of men who respond to the video , checking out their appearance and whether they can ' have a laugh ' like her ' it was not until we got home when he told me he shared it on his @entity6			1
' @entity10 says the video has been watched over 8,000 times so far and @entity12 has had around 70 messages			1
she says she 's whittled potential suitors down to between five and eight and may even be heading out on a date this week			2
@entity10 apparently was prompted to place the adverts when he found a girlfriend himself and wanted @entity12 ( right ) to also find a special someone for ' balance ' @entity10 and @entity12 work together running media company @entity29 , based in @entity83			1
but after @entity10 found himself a girlfriend he felt ' it would be nice for her to have some balance , and get her head out of her laptop '			2
asked what she looks for in a man , she said : ' i 'll admit it 's a little shallow but ... looks			0
i 'll look at their profile and through their timeline to see if they stand out , to see if they can have a laugh like me			0
