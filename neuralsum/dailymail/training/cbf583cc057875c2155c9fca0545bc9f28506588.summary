love them or not , chrysanthemums are among the world 's oldest cultivated plants			1
they 've been grown in @entity5 for more than 3,000 years and in @entity6 since around 800 ad			1
the flowers might remind you of funerals and their distinctive smell is n't to everyone 's liking			1
but as a plant group , chrysanthemums are so versatile and variable that it would be daft to write off them all off			1
huge exhibition blooms , like comic mother - in - law wedding hats , may not be to your taste			2
visit a big autumn flower show , however , or a chrysanthemum society event and you 're bound to be impressed — especially by the patience and skill needed to achieve such floral extremes			1
huge exhibition blooms , like comic mother - in - law wedding hats , may not be to your taste			2

you do n't have to be an expert to grow them			1
you could just buy what @entity38 call ' pot mums '			0
these are houseplants , raised in their millions in factories and marketed as soon as the flowers open			0
border @entity46 ' @entity47 ' — that name makes me cringe — are pretty enough , for non-gardeners			0
however if you like perennials or long - lasting patio plants , you 'll get far more satisfaction from dependable border chrysanthemums			1
they 're easy to grow and the best will provide superb colour from august to @entity57			1
colours range through clean pinks , yellows and white to brooding reds , bronzes and salmon			0
flower shapes and sizes vary widely too , from little button blooms to graceful sprays			2
if you like perennials or long - lasting patio plants , you 'll get far more satisfaction from dependable border chrysanthemums what 's more , they flower year after year and blend superbly with such other perennials as asters and late salvias			1
the tall varieties , work best at the back of the border while the more compact , bushy kinds grow beautifully in big patio pots			1
raise the stakes border chrysanthemums are good - natured , flourish in full sun in any fertile , free - draining soil			2
they hate being overcrowded and taller ones benefit from support			0
i use interlocking metal stakes coated in dark green plastic , which are barely visible like most perennials , these plants benefit from rejuvenation treatment			1
a clump will go on for years , untouched			2
but dig it up every third spring , split the roots down to small divisions and replant			0
the plants will flower more freely , grow stronger stems and retain vigour			1
you can also propagate them from cuttings taken in early spring			0

@entity111 of @entity112 ( woottensplants.com ) stock an impressive range , some available now ; others to be propagated for later			0
find chrysanthemum plants on sale at garden centres now , among other perennials my favourites from their list include the brooding red @entity121 , gorgeous single pink @entity124 and purplish pink , button - sized @entity126			1
larger flowered varieties include the tall , old - fashioned white variety @entity129			0
the best border varieties have a long flowering period			0
in my garden , @entity132 opens in august , sometimes with a second burst of later flowers			2
last to appear , silvery pink @entity136 still carries bloom in early december			0
a useful trick with early varieties such as the pink @entity142 and straw - to - salmon @entity143 is to do the ' @entity146 chop '			0
during @entity146 week — around may 21 — cut all young stems back by a third of their height			0
this improves their standing power and extends the flowering period			0
it also delays flowering , enabling the plants to avoid thrips — a pest that can ruin petals in august , but is usually gone by september			2
who 'd have thought such brutal treatment would do a plant so many favours ?			0
