@entity0 ripped through the @entity2 lower order to secure @entity4 the @entity3 for the first time in 13 years			1
the former @entity7 fast bowler took four wickets on the final morning at @entity9 to bowl @entity2 out for 177 and seal a win for @entity4 by an innings and 152 runs			1
@entity13 , who aside from a first innings duck has been in superb form recently , made a resolute 75 , but wickets tumbled around him and the 36 - year - old @entity0 eventually removed him to make certain of the @entity3 title with a game to spare			1
his other two successes came with opponents @entity2 before he returned north			2
the white rose emphasised their dominance of this year 's competition , as they took charge of this match against their closest challengers @entity41 from the very first session			2
a century from @entity44 , as part of an opening partnership of 176 with @entity47 set the tone , and after amassing 532/9 declared , the pace attack set about dismantling the hosts			0
@entity51 ( centre ) @entity44 ( left ) and @entity0 rush to grab a stump at the end of the game @entity0 bowled beautifully to end with figures of 6 - 30 and win the game , and the title , for @entity4 @entity0 and @entity58 shared seven wickets in the first innings , and eight in the second to win the game by an innings			1
@entity58 described the title win as ' the best day of his life ' while @entity0 failed to hold back the tears during the celebrations			1
the shaggy - haired left - armer showed his enduring quality on the final morning , first swinging a ball through @entity72 's defenses and then having @entity73 caught behind with a jaffa of a delivery			0
@entity76 edged to second slip and then , after @entity79 's leg spin had removed @entity80 , @entity0 rounded of the game , and the season , with the wicket of @entity13			1
@entity0 celebrates removing @entity73 with a beauty which gave the @entity41 keeper no chance former @entity88 fast bowler @entity87 ( r ) will take credit for the excellent season @entity4 have had if the shot which finally brought an end to @entity13 's innings , a wild swipe which looped to gully , was out of keeping with his current form , the bowling performance was completely typical of @entity0 's , and @entity4 's season			1
under @entity87 's leadership the county have lost just once this season , winning eight of their 15 first class matches this season			0
in fact , since the former @entity88 fast bowler joined in 2012 , @entity4 have lost just three times			2
they lead the table by 47 points with just one game remaining , and even with games in hand neither @entity113 nor @entity114 can catch them up			2
@entity7 batsman @entity20 was leading @entity4 in the absence of club captain @entity22 , banned by the @entity119 for this match and the last one of the summer in two weeks ' time after his on - field spat with @entity123 's @entity122 at @entity124			1
@entity20 , 23 , has had many highlights for his country already - but this achievement is still one he will never forget			0
' this is obviously very special ... to get this opportunity is very memorable , ' he said			0
@entity58 celebrates a wicket on the third day - the fast bowler has taken 67 first class wickets this season @entity44 set the platform for victory with a brilliant century on day one , and @entity4 never looked back @entity136 v @entity4 - day 3 ' i did n't expect to captain the side			1
' but unfortunately it came about , in bad circumstances , and it 's credit to @entity142 that the way he has captained the side made it very easy for me this week			0
' for a big club like us not to have won anything for such a long period of time is obviously very frustrating			0
' i think the lads deserved it - they have played exceptionally well all year in all departments			0
' the guys put in some great performances with bat and ball - which meant they captained themselves - and i only had to do tinkerings here and there			0
' permanent captain @entity22 had to watch the celebrations from the side before eventually being able to lift the trophy , and wicket - keeper @entity51 said it took a gloss off the win			1
' i 'm absolutely gutted for @entity22 , not being able to be on the pitch with us at those final moments , because he 's been such a crucial part in what 's been a fantastic season for @entity4 , ' said @entity51			1
@entity22 , banned for the final two matches of the season , comes onto the pitch to lift the cup ' to drop himself at the start of the season at @entity180 shows the integrity of the bloke and shows how much the county means to him			1
' it was a real big team performance today and something we really wanted to do for @entity142 being sat up there			0
he 's a very proud man and for him not to be on the pitch with us was desperately disappointing			2
' it 's definitely not soured it but it 's still disappointing to find out the day after it happened that all of a sudden he 's banned			2
' it 's the fastest thing that i 've ever heard of and we 're all disappointed as a club that there was n't a longer time taken to look into it perhaps			0
but that 's the way that things have panned out			0
' we 've moved on from that , taken it on the chin and come here and put on a fantastic display			0
