having a car that can drive itself has long been the stuff of science fiction			2
but scientists have now created a robot car – controlled by an @entity5			1
and the @entity7 team says the technology could be installed in mainstream cars within 15 years			1
it means futuristic vehicles , like @entity13 ’s @entity12 in the 1980s tv series @entity15 , could soon be driving us on the commute and school run			0
when the car is driven manually the lasers and cameras act as its ‘ eyes ’ , mapping a 3d model of its surroundings , which is fed into a computer stored in the boot			1
the car can then ‘ remember ’ roads and suburbs , allowing it to drive itself along familiar routes			1
it asks the driver via an @entity5 on the dashboard whether they want to engage the autopilot and , at a touch of the screen , the car takes over the controls			1
a laser under the front bumper scans the direction of travel around 13 times per second for obstacles , such as pedestrians , cyclists , or other cars , up to 164ft ahead and in an 85 degree field of view			2
if the car sees an obstacle , it slows and comes to a controlled stop			1
the driver can also tap the brake pedal , like in current cruise control systems , to regain control from the computer at any time			1
car in control : an @entity7 scientist demonstrates their newly developed navigation system the scientists behind the system say it is far superior to conventional satellite navigation because it is much more precise – reading to within a fraction of an inch compared with a few yards with sat - nav – and the car does not need a satellite reference to know where it is			1
at £ 5,000 , the prototype is also far cheaper than any other currently in development – and the aim is to produce one for as little as £ 100 in the near future			0
project leader professor @entity84 , of @entity7 ’s engineering science department , said that the technology would be especially valuable for drivers who perform regular routes , such the daily commute or school run			1
he added : ‘ we are working on a low - cost auto drive navigation system that does n’t depend on gps , done with discreet sensors that are getting cheaper all the time			0
‘ it ’s easy to imagine that this kind of technology could be in a car you could buy			1
accept ? tapping on the brakes returns control of the vehicle to the driver ‘ instead of imagining some cars driving themselves all of the time , we should imagine a time when all cars can drive themselves some of the time			1
‘ the sort of low - cost , low - footprint autonomy we are developing is what ’s needed for everyday use			0
’ last year , @entity115 announced a self - driving car which it said had covered more than 140,000 miles on @entity118 roads			2
the @entity21 has fewer sensors and relies more heavily on an on - board 3d street map			1
the basic map could potentially be maintained by local councils or highway authorities and regularly updated by vehicles			0
for insurance reasons , the @entity21 has so far only been allowed to drive on autopilot on the private roads of @entity128 , @entity129			1
but the scientists are in talks with the @entity132 to see how and when it could be used on public roads			0
the next stage of the research will be to make the car recognise and understand complex traffic flows and make decisions on which routes to take			2
professor @entity84 added : ‘ while there ’s lots more work to do , it shows the potential for this kind of affordable robotic system that could make our car journeys safer , more efficient and more pleasant for drivers			0

at £ 5,000 , the prototype is also considerably cheaper than any other currently in development , although the aim is to produce one for as little as £ 100 in the not too distant future			0

‘ it ’s easy to imagine that this kind of technology could be in a car you could buy			2
‘ instead of imagining some cars driving themselves all of the time we should imagine a time when all cars can drive themselves some of the time			0
the sort of very low - cost , low - footprint autonomy we are developing is what ’s needed for everyday use			0
’ already there are cars that can park themselves and last year @entity115 announced its self - driving car saying that it had covered more than 140,000 miles on @entity118 roads			2
look , no hands ! the car would take over the driving on familiar routes the car can sense people in the road and stop when in autodrive mode the @entity129 car differs from @entity115 ’s by having fewer sensors and relying more heavily on an on - board three dimensional map of streets			1
the basic map could potentially be maintained by local councils or highway authorities and regularly updated by vehicles			0
for insurance , legal and health and safety reasons , the @entity21 has so far only been allowed to drive on private roads around the scientists ’ @entity128 on autopilot			1
but they are currently in talks with the @entity219 to see how and when it could be used on public roads			0
the next stage of their research , which is part funded by the @entity225 and is a collaboration between the university and sponsors @entity23 , @entity228 and @entity229 , will be to make the car recognise and understand complex traffic flows and make decisions on which routes to take			1
the @entity132 estimates that cost of congestion will rise to £ 24billion a year by 2025 so vehicles , like this prototype , could help alleviate some of those costs by avoiding jams and giving the driver time off to do other tasks			0

car slows to a controlled stop if there is an obstruction in the road
driver can take back control by tapping on the brakes
