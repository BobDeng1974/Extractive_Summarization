by @entity0 @entity3 's @entity2 wearable computer contains just $ 80 worth of electronic components , a website which took one of the $ 1500 gadgets apart has found			1
the teardown.com site took one of the prototype smart specs , which are a prototype ' explorer edition ' designed to help people build apps , apart and posted these amazing images of what goes into @entity2			1
@entity3 is expected to reveal a cheaper , consumer version later this year			1
the cost of @entity2 : the site was able to work out the cost of every component in @entity2 - which came to a total of $ 79.78 originally the @entity2 was only available to ' explorers ' better known as developers			1
finally @entity3 offered a one day sale on april 15 , 2014 allowing the general public to purchase the @entity2 for a $ 1500 - when teardown.com bought theirs			1
they found the single most expensive part inside @entity2 is a @entity44 4430 applications processor , which costs $ 13.96			1
there is also a $ 5.66 camera , a $ 3 display , and @entity48 of @entity50 flash memory from @entity51 for $ 8.18 , bringing the total to $ 79.78			0
however , the site admits this is just a rough estimate of the cost of the parts			0
the site said it will be doing a deeper inspection			0
' now that the @entity2 is part way through the full @entity62 analysis we will have a better understanding of what each component costs , ' said @entity67 , a spokesman at the site			1
however , a @entity3 spokesperson said the teardown estimate was wrong , according to @entity71 , and declined to comment further			1
the site was also able to identify many of the components used , including the gps chip , made by @entity75 ( orange ) , the @entity78 control chip ( red ) and the audio chip ( green ) that drives the bone conduction speaker in glass , as well as the headphones that can be plugged in			0
glass also has a touchscreen control , shown here , controlled with a @entity87 chip ( red ) the @entity88 , supplied by @entity51 , is shown in red , and a second type of memory from @entity92 is in @entity93			0
glass has an applications processor chip ( orange ) and a power management chip as well , along with a special maths chip ( yellow ) earlier this month @entity3 allowed anyone in the @entity100 to buy them			1
' the number of spots available is limited , so mark your calendar if you want to get in , ' the firm said			0
@entity3 will also include a free sunglass shade or one of its newly - introduced prescription glasses frames along with any purchase			1
those who currently own the device paid $ 1,500 to be part of the development process , exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device			0
what goes into @entity2 : @entity21 took apart @entity3 's @entity2 hardware and revealed exactly what goes into it @entity2 can also clip onto specially developed prescription lenses			1
with the release of the second - generation , those already enrolled in the @entity127 program were able to ' invite ' three of their friends to the scheme			0
reaction to the new design was mixed , with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky			0
@entity3 has come under fire for the unfashionable look of @entity2 , although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses , and partnered with @entity142 to develop fashionable frames			1
the ' arm ' that contains the glass circuitry ( left ) showing the camera lens exposed			0
on the right is the prism that allows wearers to see an image			0
however , the updates were welcomed by those who have a first - generation device , with comments on its @entity3 + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience			2
one owner , @entity159 , commented : ' my glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because i ca n't hear it well enough ... yay for updates / upgrades ! ' another fan of the device , @entity169 , commented : ' ca n't wait ... now that we 'll be able to use them with prescription glasses , they 'll be glued to my face			0
' ﻿ others however complained that the device was still not widely available			0
@entity3 recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its @entity2 wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as ' creepy and rude ' for wearing the device			1
the firm warns users to ask people 's permission before recording them , and warns against ' glassing out ' where they focus on the screen too much			2
the guide comes as @entity3 is expanding the number of people who have the $ 1500 prototypes , ahead of an expected release later this year			1
' with new technology comes new questions , and our explorers help to answer those questions , ' @entity3 said			2
' since the program started , our explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear @entity2 out and about			2
' reactions range from the curious – ' wow ! are those the ‘ @entity3 glasses ’ ? how do they work ? ” – to the suspect – ' @entity204 gracious do those things see into my soul ? ! ' however , the @entity127 program has been praised for using a clever marketing model where people buy a product at its developmental stage so they can contribute to shaping its design			2
' in essence @entity3 has crowdfunded glass and has shown big business how crowdfunding can be done			2
in essence it is a giant kickstarter campaign in all but name , ' according to @entity221			0
it estimated that @entity3 would have earned about $ 50 million during the development phase as well as enhancing the desirability of the product .			2
