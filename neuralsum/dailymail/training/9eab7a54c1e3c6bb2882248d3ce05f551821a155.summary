@entity0 was caught urinating on a bouncer in @entity2 last year , while he received a suspended ban for ' potentially threatening and intimidating ' behaviour in september			2
@entity0 ran into more disciplinary trouble at the worst possible time when he was dropped by @entity7 just as @entity9 selectors prepare to pick their team to face @entity11 in the first test			1
@entity0 was left out despite being chosen on saturday to play against @entity13 in the championship when he failed to turn up for a team meeting yesterday morning after ‘ forgetting ’ that it had been scheduled			1
@entity7 were quick to stress that they did not consider the matter to be serious			0
but it was the latest and most untimely example of @entity0 ’s ability to run into the sort of trouble which saw him sacked by @entity22 last season			0
@entity25 ’s retirement has left @entity9 in desperate need of a quality spinner and @entity0 , at 32 , remains the best specialist option when they meet on wednesday to consider their options for @entity30 ’s on june 12			1
yet he is likely to be pipped for a place by an all - round option in either @entity33 or @entity34 with @entity9 as concerned as much by @entity0 ’s temperament as his ability to bowl out @entity11 on what is expected to be a flat pitch			1
yet , the noises emerging from @entity59 suggest @entity0 has been a handful this season			1
he was warned by his new county about his body language in an early @entity7 match and had a row with @entity67 ’s @entity66 that led to him being told to calm down by the umpires in a championship game			2
he was replaced by the promising leg - spinner @entity70 yesterday and must smarten up his act if he is not going to squander the chance @entity7 have given him to rebuild a career of such achievement before @entity25 usurped him			2
meanwhile , the man who played one of the great one - day innings at @entity79 on saturday in @entity9 ’s narrow fourth one - day international defeat is adamant that he is not yet ready to be considered by @entity9 for the two - test series			1
are you ready ? @entity83 is set to name his first @entity85 squad back in the @entity9 hotseat on thursday @entity87 took @entity9 to within seven runs of their highest successful run chase in any one - day international on home soil with his sublime 121 from 74 balls against @entity11 but does not expect to play in the first test next week			1
‘ i am probably not ready for that , ’ he said			0
‘ i average 32 in first - class cricket and my glovework needs to improve , too , if i ’m to play in @entity85			0
i ’m 23 and have time to work on these things			0
’ @entity9 ’s first choice remains @entity99 and all will depend on how he comes through @entity22 ’s @entity44 match with @entity102 at @entity103 where the @entity9 vice-captain reclaimed the gloves yesterday			0
@entity106 : @entity87 thinks he is not yet ready for @entity85 despite his stunning ton at @entity79 prior ’s chronic achilles condition has kept him out of four - day cricket ever since he scored a century for @entity22 in their first game of the season and @entity112 , the national selector , has insisted that @entity9 would not risk any player they deem not to be totally fit			1
it now seems almost certain that , should prior not be considered fully fit , @entity9 will turn to the man who remains one of the best wicketkeepers in the world in @entity7 captain @entity118			2
@entity118 played the last of his seven tests almost 12 years ago and his return now , at 34 , would be a comeback almost as remarkable as @entity122 ’s			0
@entity9 look set to pick him ahead of @entity87 and @entity124 , especially if they pick all - rounders in @entity126 and @entity127 .			0

@entity9 spinner had been named in @entity131 's side
@entity7 face @entity13 in four - day match at @entity59
either @entity33 or @entity34 are to pip @entity0 to test place
