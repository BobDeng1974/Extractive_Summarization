the return to the ground of their former club can be the making or breaking of a @entity6 player			2
will they buckle under the pressure or show the fans what they have been missing ? it is @entity14 's turn this weekend , with the former @entity16 stalwart returning to @entity17 with @entity18			1
the defender will no doubt get a better reaction than players such as @entity22 and @entity23 at their old teams , but how do the @entity16 faithful usually greet their former heroes ? @entity27 looks at the some of the welcomes over the years			1
@entity14 is set to start at @entity17 this sunday as @entity18 take on @entity16 @entity14 enjoyed several successful years at @entity16 but left in the summer @entity30 ( @entity31 , @entity32 ) nicknamed the @entity33 , @entity30 helped @entity16 to their first top division title in 26 years in 1992/93			1
however , sir @entity35 soon got tired of his attitude and shipped him off to @entity38			0
no @entity16 fan would have expected him to end up at @entity31 two years later in 1997 though , and they did n't give him an easy ride on his first appearance back ' home ' at @entity17			1
the @entity43 international was booed from start to finish in his two games as a @entity31 player there , and although things were a little easier with @entity32 , @entity30 took it to heart			1
' i sweated blood for six years for that club and some of them give me stick , ' he said			0
' @entity30 was given a hostile welcome when he returned to @entity17 with @entity31 in 1998 @entity30 left @entity16 for @entity38 at first and later played for @entity32 at their home @entity60 ( @entity61 ) often heralded as the greatest goalkeeper in the @entity6 era , @entity60 , like @entity30 , ended up at one of @entity16 's biggest rivals			1
but his relationship at the club is much different			0
after scooping five @entity6 titles in his seven years at @entity17 , @entity60 made his way to @entity61 and @entity70 via @entity71 in @entity72			1
the goalkeeper received a rapturous reception with the @entity76 side , while even when representing the blue side of @entity78 he was talked about fondly			2
has admitted he was glad he pulled up injured in the warm - up ahead of @entity70 's visit to @entity17 so his feelings would n't get the best of him , while he was even forgiven for producing his trademark celebration when @entity85 's side won 3 - 1 at @entity86 earlier in the season			2
@entity60 was emotional when he returned to @entity17 for @entity61 but was received well @entity60 won the @entity88 with @entity16 in what was his last game for the club the @entity93 goalkeeper injured himself in the warm - up as @entity70 went to play their rivals @entity96 ( @entity97 ) the poster boy from the famous class of ' 92 graduates , @entity96 walked out the door ( helped along with a kick from @entity35 ) in 2003 to join @entity103			1
the midfield maestro said he would always support @entity16 , but had to wait until a loan move with @entity97 before he could meet the fans once again			2
the @entity88 tie was all but over by the time @entity96 got on , while he was seen greeting and cuddling members of staff in the tunnel at half - time			2
given a standing ovation at full - time , @entity96 donned the @entity117 green and gold scarf as he exited the pitch			2
' when i first heard about the tie i think i almost cried because it is such a special place for me , ' he said			0
@entity96 applauds the fans after returning ' home ' with @entity97 in the @entity88 in 2010 @entity124 fans display a banner to welcome @entity96 back to @entity17 @entity126 ( @entity70 ) ' i expect to have a good reception			1
while at @entity16 , i always gave my best and i had good relations with the fans , ' @entity126 , september 18 , 2009			1
two days later he was subject of vile abuse , coin throwing and a chorus of boos upon entering the arena			0
but what else can he expect after leaving @entity16 despite the admiration of @entity35 , to join the wealthy rivals in a big - money deal ? after the 4 - 3 defeat , @entity126 said : ' it was incredible because i have never seen something like that happen in the two years i played at @entity17 , ' as soon as i entered the field the atmosphere was very different			1
it was hard to take because previously i was always wanted by those people			0
but i suppose in football situations change			0
@entity126 controversially made the move to sign for @entity70 from @entity16 in 2009 the @entity148 had several happy moments with @entity16 but joined the wealthy rivals @entity150 ( @entity103 ) ever since turning up as a @entity72 teenager in 2004 , @entity150 's relationship with the @entity16 fans was special			1
for they had watched the scrwany winger transform into the best player in the world			0
@entity150 returned to @entity17 in 2013 for a crucial @entity88 round of 16 game for @entity103			1
he had joined his dream side , the @entity161 , for a world record fee two years earlier			0
undeterred by the emotions but also appreciative of the booming claps before kick - off , @entity150 netted in a controversial fixture that saw @entity103 advance in front of a fuming @entity35			2
the forward refused to celebrate , earning the respect of the @entity78 faithful , and may well be back again soon			0
. ‘ i love @entity78 , ’ he told @entity27			0
‘ everyone knows that — i have said it many times			0
@entity78 is in my heart			0
i left many good friends there , the supporters are amazing and i wish i can come back one day			0
’ @entity150 did n't celebrate when he scored for @entity103 against @entity16 in the last 16			1

@entity14 should start for @entity18 against @entity16 on sunday
the defender should expect a fine reception at @entity17
unlike @entity30 and @entity126 , who were booed at the stadium
@entity60 , @entity96 and @entity150 were cheered
