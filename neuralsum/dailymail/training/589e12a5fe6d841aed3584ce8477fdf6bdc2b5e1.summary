the @entity0 was once known across the world for the precise elocution of its presenters			1
but the corporation is now facing complaints that its staff are making basic errors in the use of @entity9			0
a number of viewers have pointed out that television personalities are increasingly pronouncing the letter ‘ h ’ as ‘ haitch ’ instead of ‘ aitch ’			0
viewers pointed to @entity17 as one of a number of @entity0 presenters who fail to pronounce ' h ' in a correct way appearing on @entity23 , a programme which airs public concerns over @entity0 content , one branded the falling standards ‘ horrible , horrendous and harmful ’ while another urged the corporation to ‘ educate your presenters ’			1
@entity23 highlighted several instances of the @entity0 broadcasting mispronunciations of ‘ h ’ , including an advert for the @entity35 in @entity36 , in which guest presenter @entity17 makes the error , and another television appearance by @entity41 breakfast host @entity39 who makes the same mistake			2
speaking yesterday , campaigners said such mistakes marked the beginning of a ‘ slippery slope ’ and called on the @entity0 to only hire presenters who use the @entity9 language correctly			1
@entity23 presenter @entity49 said the programme had collected a ‘ whole folder ’ of complaints about the issue and two viewers appeared on the show to express their concerns			0
june @entity57 said : ‘ would the @entity0 please instruct their presenters and commentators on the correct pronunciation of the letter “ h ”			1
for example , when announcing a programme is to be in hd , they will say @entity67			0
please @entity0 , educate your presenters			2
’ radio 1 breakfast host @entity39 has also come under fire by @entity0 viewers over his @entity9 elocution while @entity73 added : ‘ i just can not believe my ears that you , the guardian of the @entity76 ’s @entity9 , is showing a television trailer where someone mispronounces the letter “ h ” as haitch			0
' surely , this should never have been allowed to air , it ’s horrible , it ’s horrendous and it ’s harmful to the @entity9 language			1
is this the thin end of the wedge ? ’ according to campaigners , such a decline in standards in the @entity0 ’s use of @entity9 could have negative impacts across the world			1
@entity96 , who recently stepped down as secretary of the @entity98 , said : ‘ with the @entity0 in particular , it is listened to by a worldwide audience and people for whom @entity9 is a second language look to the @entity0 for an example of what is good @entity9			1
‘ there are a whole number of reasons why the @entity0 might choose to recruit someone onto its staff as a broadcaster and maybe the use of @entity9 should be one and @entity0 broadcasters should be people to aspire to good , correct @entity9 usage ’			0
dr @entity117 , the group ’s president , added : ‘ it is a problem because presenters can be quite influential , so a mistake that broadcasters start taking up is easily spread to the rest of the population			0
‘ i take the view that you have to be very careful about slippery slopes and if you let one or two things through it will encourage people to let even more things through and become slacker and slacker			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity0 said : ' the @entity0 has won awards for its use of language and we are proud of the range of voices heard across our programmes			2
