in @entity3 ’s world , everything runs on time			1
a 10.30am press briefing means 10.30am and @entity3 arrived on the button in the @entity6 in the @entity7 on sunday			1
straight - backed , eagle - eye stare in place , arms folded , @entity8 looked like he was braced for trouble			0
initially , everything ran smoothly			0
was it a distraction ? ‘ no , ’ he said , clearly inviting another subject			0
in the room the @entity31 media folk let out a sigh of relief			2
@entity3 had kicked for touch , and found it			1
perhaps lightening up , @entity3 gave an incisive insight into the performance on friday , his annoyance at the concession of the goal , and what was needed from the players for the next six games if @entity16 are to qualify			1
his appreciation of the challenge facing him and @entity48 was flecked with nuggets as @entity3 plugged @entity51 ’s abilities over @entity52 , and hailed the long - serving striker as ‘ as good a professional as i have come across			1
’ @entity3 believes his namesake @entity55 is a better frontman than former @entity16 striker @entity52 @entity3 also joked about being able to leave the hotel without any security baggage			1
‘ we ’re not @entity60 , ’ he said with deadpan wit			0
he revisited his touchline spat with the referee in @entity63 on friday night			0
‘ i was surprised he came over			0
that ’s our job to try to get instructions on to a player or to appeal a decision			2
i do n’t think there was anything over the top , ’ he said			0
‘ when a referee comes over and there ’s a couple of photographs taken as usual it always looks 100 times worse than what it is , but it was no big thing			0
’ for over half - an - hour everything was calm , cordial and under control			0
@entity3 had a wee dig at @entity84 ’s indecision about declaring for @entity16			1
@entity3 had a dig at @entity84 ( left ) over the @entity88 youngster 's indecision about declaring for @entity16 more seriously , he expressed concerns that @entity91 manager @entity90 may be putting a squeeze on his @entity16 players , specifically @entity94 and @entity95			1
‘ it does seem to be that @entity94 and @entity95 are under lots of pressure — they ’re turning up , or they might n’t turn up , or they ’re struggling , ’ he said			0
and then , @entity102 asked @entity3 about all the distractions involving him over the last six months , most recently the hassle with @entity20			1
@entity3 is concerned that @entity91 are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty @entity91 's @entity95 has missed the @entity16 's last three @entity112 qualifiers @entity102 : ‘ i ’d like your thoughts on this , between the @entity117 link , @entity88 link , book being published , and the incident last week …			1
’ @entity3 : ‘ i ’m not giving you any comment			2
why would you think i have to give you an opinion on everything ? do you think you ’ve a right to sit there and ask me anything you want , and get an answer ? i think i ’ve been more than fair with you			0
’ @entity102 : ‘ you have ( been fair )			0
but my point is @entity48 ( @entity129 ) has been asked about the distractions			1
has he had enough of those distractions ? @entity3 : ‘ what are you asking me for ? what are you talking about ? what distractions ? can i do anything about the @entity117 stuff ? ’ @entity102 : ‘ yeah , @entity117 and @entity88			1
’ @entity3 : ‘ can i do anything about them things that come up ? if i get approached about a job and i ’m up front with the manager and the media , do you want me to … how is that a distraction ? ‘ what can i do about that ? you ’re making out i ’m bringing all these distractions on			1
’ @entity3 claimed the media are making out he is bringing distractions to the @entity16 squad @entity102 : ‘ just a coincidence ? ’ @entity3 : ‘ well , if a club approaches me , these things just happen , yeah			1
you think the book ’s a distraction to a group of professional people ? do me a favour			0
‘ and then people all writing about the incident the other night , lies …			2
and people have got pals and talking to them			0
‘ you think i ’ve got to justify that to everyone ? you all sit there and think i ’ve got to answer to everything ? who in the hell do you think you are ? i ’ve got to answer to you ? ‘ i answer to the @entity31 and @entity48			2
and if we do n’t get the right results , i ’ll be gone and you wo n’t lose a minute ’s sleep , so do n’t worry about distractions			0
the things you write about are distractions			0
’ @entity102 : ‘ we write about it , but it was an obvious thing to write about			0
’ @entity3 : ‘ exactly			2
but you ’re on about @entity117 and @entity88			2
what do you want me to do about them ? if @entity117 approached me , what did you want me to say ? you could n’t get enough of it			2
so what can i do about the @entity117 situation ? ’ @entity3 was speaking at a press conference ahead of his team 's match against @entity185 on tuesday @entity102 : ‘ i do n’t know			1
it was extraordinary that @entity48 brought it to our attention … ’ @entity3 : ‘ what other incident ? the book ? do you think the book was a distraction ? an agreement was made six months before it was out			1
what ’s he said ? ’ @entity102 : ‘ i think he ’s had enough of these ( distractions ) ? ’ @entity3 : ‘ go and ask him			1
go and see him in the lobby			0
you ’re not brave enough to ask him ? ’ @entity102 : ‘ i am brave enough to ask him			0
’ @entity3 : ‘ go and ask him			2
you ’re asking me what @entity48 might be thinking ? why do n’t you ask @entity48 ? what if we qualified ? do you think it will be a distraction ? are you thinking it ’s all a distraction from the result the other night ? ’ @entity3 accused the media of not being brave enough to ask manager @entity48 about the ' distractions ' @entity102 : ‘ it was the build - up to the game for 24 hours			1
everyone was talking about it			0
’ @entity3 : ‘ what was the problem ? @entity102 : ‘ we were all talking about it			2
’ @entity3 : ‘ talking about what ? talking about something you do n’t have a clue about , and everyone writing lies			1
for @entity16 , the @entity31 and @entity48 , the ticking continues .			1
