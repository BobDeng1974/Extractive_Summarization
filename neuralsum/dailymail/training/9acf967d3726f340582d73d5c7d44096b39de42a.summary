international flight security concerns have been raised as passengers on board a flight from @entity4 to @entity6 's @entity5 were left to bypass immigration when the plane arrived at the wrong terminal			1
passengers on the @entity12 fight were let out into a section of the airport where they did not have to pass through immigration or customs			1
they were only stopped when airport employees realised they were in the wrong part of the airport			2
passengers would usually be shuffled through the arriving immigrations and customs desks upon arrival to @entity5 , but on this flight they were allowed to bypass them plane crazy : the passengers were dropped off at a baggage claim terminal at @entity5 ( stock picture of the airport ) , which could have allowed some with carry - on luggage to just stroll out of the airport the passengers aboard the flight , @entity12 3 , which took off from @entity34 , found that instead of their expected customs and immigration check , they instead departed inside a domestic baggage claim			1
@entity39 was alerted to the news by a passenger on the flight , @entity43 , whose wife is a @entity45 employee			1
@entity43 , 42 , is originally from @entity46 but now lives in @entity6 , and was as flying back from @entity47 after visiting his mum			0
according to @entity43 , the plane only had about 54 people aboard , and was by no means full			0
passengers on the @entity12 flight were eventually rounded up and put through immigration and customs , but not before they were let out at the baggage claim passengers were left next to the @entity12 baggage claim terminal of @entity5 upon arrival in the @entity59 @entity43 said : ‘ when we arrived at @entity5 we pulled up to the gate and the door opened , we got off and walk off the jet bridge			1
' we did n’t really think about it but we were basically in the main part of the terminal where the passengers were preparing to board			2
‘ we kept walking past shops and duty free and restaurants and then we realised it was a bit strange			0
' we just kept going			0
terminal 4 at @entity5 is pretty big so you just go and go			0
' the only place to go to eventually was domestic baggage , so we went to the baggage counter and we explained what happened and they just asked us “ why are you here ? " ' it was just weird , very unusual			2
' @entity5 is the 17th busiest airport in the world and the 6th busiest in the @entity59 @entity43 said : ‘ i could have just left the airport and kept going , no question about it			0
' i was practically out the front door of the airport but realised i have to go get my bag			0
‘ if you did n’t have checked luggage you could have just left , got in a cab and been gone			0
’ he said that eventually officials rounded them up , escorted them into main immigration arrivals hall and security officials took their name			0
the entire processing of the passengers , from the gate to leaving the airport , reportedly took about just over an hour			1
@entity12 told @entity45 it is aware that ' a small number of customers off @entity12 flight 3 from @entity4 to @entity6 's @entity5 were able to bypass customs screening			1
they said : ' @entity12 is working with the @entity109 as well as @entity110 and is looking into the matter			1
' customer security is of vital importance and @entity12 makes every effort to follow appropriate procedures			2

@entity12 flight from @entity34 took passengers to the wrong gate
passengers were taken to a baggage claim gate instead of immigration
those who *congregated* at the baggage claim had names taken down
according to a passenger , those with carry - on bags could have walked out
