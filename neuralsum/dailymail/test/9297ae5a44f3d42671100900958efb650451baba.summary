a stunning fireball that crackled across the sky near the @entity4 - @entity3 border last year shared its orbit with a huge asteroid found in october			1
this is according to a new study which claims the @entity10 fireball had a ' disturbingly similar ' path to asteroid 2014 @entity12 , which is due to pass by the moon in 2017			1
spotted on april 19 last year , researchers used camera footage to help recreate its trajectory and hunt down any remaining fragments			2
a stunning fireball that crackled across the sky near the @entity4 - @entity3 border last year shared its orbit with a huge asteroid found in october			2
pictured is he fireball at the time of entry at the @entity26 @entity27 , a researcher at the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , headed the team of scientists who studied the meteorite 's orbit			1
they determined the fireball 's path by studying its flight and the meteorite 's final impact site , before creating a computer model based on those figures			1
this led researchers to the @entity46 meteorite , which is an ordinary @entity47 chondrite - a group of space rocks with high strength that make up 31 per cent of meteorite falls			0
the computer model compared the orbit of @entity46 , a 1,100lb ( 500kg ) rock , with the evolution of a dozen orbits of near - @entity57 asteroids			1

this led researchers to the @entity46 meteorite ( pictured ) the computer model compared the orbit of @entity46 ( pictured ) , a 1,100lb ( 500kg ) rock , with the evolution of a dozen orbits of near - @entity57 asteroids 2014 @entity12 , a mountain - sized asteroid which passes @entity57 every three years , was discovered by @entity4 scientists in december			1
@entity72 , a professor at @entity73 , said the space rock , poses no immediate threat - although warned it could ' theoretically ' hit @entity57			0
. however , he said it highlights the damage an asteroid could cause - in this case an explosion 1,000 times greater than the surprise 2013 impact of a bus - sized meteor in @entity4			2
at 400 - metres ( 1,300 feet ) in size , the space rock is about the same size as the @entity89 is tall			0
@entity90 said it is difficult to calculate the orbit of big rocks like ' 2014 @entity12 ' because their trajectories are constantly being changed by the gravitational pull of other planets			1
it showed a similarity with the evolution of 2014 @entity12 , which given its size and minimum distance to the planet , has been classed a ' potentially dangerous asteroid '			1
@entity72 , a professor at @entity73 , said the space rock , poses no immediate threat - although warned it could ' theoretically ' hit @entity57			0
currently , 1,573 asteroids of this type are known so researchers are investigating to what extent they can pose a danger			0
while the study does not claim that asteroid 2014 @entity12 sent the @entity46 meteorite directly at @entity57 , it suggests the two bodies are related			1
scientists believe that streams of asteroid fragments can travel on nearly identical orbits			1
tidal forces may disperse the debris over time and asteroids can also break up due to the pull of large planets			2
' the tidal effect on an asteroid , which rapidly rotates under the gravitational field of a planet , can fragment these objects or release large rocks from its surface , ' said @entity134			2
' [ this ] could then become such dangerous projectiles at a local scale as the one fell in @entity139 ( @entity4 ) on february 15th 2013 '			0
@entity140 , @entity141 researcher that participated in the study , explains : ' the data we have obtained provided new clues about the origin of the rocks with a few meters in diameter that produce meteorite falls			0
' so far , we only know the orbits of other 22 meteorites , and not always with the sought accuracy			0
' the researchers hope their latest study will help shed light on how asteroid create projectiles , and which ones pose a threat to @entity57			0
knowing where the meteorite originates could also help them us better understand the formation and evolution of the solar system			0
the @entity26 , where the fireball hit , is a peninsula in the far northwest of @entity4			0
constituting the bulk of the territory of @entity171 , it lies almost completely to the north of the @entity173			0

scientists created a computer model to analyse @entity10 fireball 's trajectory
it had similar orbit to asteroid 2014 @entity12 due to pass by moon in 2017
this suggests the two bodies may be related as streams of asteroid fragments can travel on nearly identical orbits
