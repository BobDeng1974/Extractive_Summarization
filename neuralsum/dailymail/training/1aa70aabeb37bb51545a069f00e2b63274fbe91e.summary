it is a measure of the job facing @entity2 on sunday night as his @entity4 side face @entity5 that he comes up against one of the scourges of his @entity9 managerial career in @entity10 and yet the former @entity12 striker will not be his biggest concern			1
@entity14 must also deal with @entity15 who scored 58 goals for club and country in 2014 and wants to start 2015 in style			2
@entity2 said of the @entity20 : ' we will try to stop him but everyone tries to stop him			2
he is a very special player			0
we have all been privileged to watch him play over the years			0
' @entity10 , who will partner @entity15 and @entity23 in attack for @entity5 this evening , clashed with @entity2 in the 2012 - 13 season when the then @entity27 manager criticised him for diving ahead of a @entity30 derby in which @entity27 's @entity31 ended up being booked for simulation			1
' @entity2 's comment struck me because they were made before the game ; you can talk after the game if i have dived against your team but he complained before so i thought : ' you think i dive ? i 'll show you a dive			2
' @entity10 also scored against @entity2 when @entity12 beat @entity63 3 - 0 a month before he lost his job			1
speaking ahead of tonight 's game the @entity4 coach , who has made a steady start at the @entity68 club , underlined the enormity of the task in hand facing @entity5			1
@entity10 dives in front of @entity2 in celebration after scoring in the @entity30 derby in october 2012 @entity2 has won two , drawn four and lost one game since taking over as @entity4 's manager he said : ' it 's difficult to take the game to them because they have so much of the ball			1
they have fantastic individual talents who can win the game on their own but for the sustained success that they have had you need more than that			0
they have been a special team and still are			0
i am really looking forward to the game			0
i am looking forward to challenging such a good team			0
' with @entity10 , @entity15 and @entity23 all recently back from mid-winter breaks in @entity98 and the club still reeling from the refusal of the @entity101 to reduce the @entity103 - imposed year - long transfer ban , this may be a good time to play @entity105 's side			1
@entity4 beat @entity5 last season and have already taken the scalps of @entity108 and @entity109 this campaign			1
@entity2 added : ' the players have shown they can beat @entity5 before so we have to show it again			2
we have to show them that this is not an easy place to come and win			0
we have to be tough			0
' but , as well as @entity10 , @entity2 will have to find a way to stop @entity15 and @entity23 on sunday the controversial @entity44 forward has scored three times since his Â£ 75m summer move from @entity12			1

@entity4 host @entity5 in @entity38 on sunday evening
@entity2 will have to find a way to halt @entity10 and @entity15
@entity10 scored against @entity2 ' @entity27 and @entity63 sides
but the @entity127 said he is looking forward to the encounter
