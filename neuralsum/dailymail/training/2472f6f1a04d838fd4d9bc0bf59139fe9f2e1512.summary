we ca n’t say we were n’t warned			2
@entity1 went out of his way before the game to insist that this would n’t be the start of a new era and he was right			0
@entity1 is always wary of the easy sound - bite so he ca n’t be blamed for refusing to play the media ’s game			2
he probably suspected , rightly , that to bill this game as a new dawn would have been trite – and it would			0
more to the point , he probably also feared his team could easily be mediocre again			0
@entity28 and @entity29 have retired , but the latter hardly played , so it ’s not as though there have been a raft of thirty something players blocking the progress of the youngsters			0
with @entity19 , you get what we have ; what we have is shallow seam of talent			1
it was clear to all - certainly to the paying public , who recorded the lowest international crowd at the new @entity46 - that the @entity47 was a reflection on @entity19 ’s real status			1
tricky : @entity16 wins a penalty in the second half which was despatched by @entity18 dastardly foreigners did n’t conspire to undo us , there was no hand of @entity56 on which to place the blame ; @entity19 simply could n’t match good teams tactically or psychologically			1
all of which means the road to @entity61 is going to be slow and steady for this current generation entrusted with representing the national team			0
if you wished to be optimistic you would point to @entity65 and @entity16 ’s link ups and @entity15 ’s enthusiasm when he came on			1
silver lining : @entity65 ( left ) and @entity16 were lively during @entity19 's win against @entity70 in fact , principally you would look to @entity16 , especially when he was moved behind the front two for the last 20 minutes , and you might even feel hopeful about the future , though that thought in itself is a little scary ; that a nineteen year old carries our hopes			1
if you wanted a reality check you would turn to the back four			0
@entity77 is being eased out after a @entity47 which exposed his talents , but not because there is anyone better , simply because you might as well bet on @entity82 at 22 potentially getting better			0
in a first half in which @entity70 declined to participate meaningfully , it was difficult to judge the defenders			1
in the second , when presumably their manager @entity87 had reminded them quite how ordinary @entity19 are , the shortcomings were painfully familiar			1
in his defence : @entity90 was steady at right back but looks to be a more natural centre back hard to handle : @entity92 ( right ) caused @entity94 and @entity82 problems @entity92 is no @entity95 but he forced @entity96 into two good saves , with @entity94 and @entity82 error prone and static			0
with a @entity100 or a @entity101 alongside them , they can look good but neither looks capable of assuming that dominant role without a mentor			0
@entity90 may graduate into the centre			0
he looks more comfortable there than at right back , where he was merely steady enough			0
@entity108 was presumably grateful for a quiet night opposite @entity109 after his travails in @entity111			0
in the next two years we will discover whether these players , along with @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and perhaps some outliers such as @entity118 can develop into defenders of international quality			0
for now , they remain what they were in @entity111 : fragile			2
step up : the likes of @entity124 ( above ) and @entity125 must establish a grip on games we saw a little of @entity128 and he was clearly determined to impress , which on a night which was presaged by exceedingly low expectations and delivered on them , was at least encouraging			2
but it is @entity125 and @entity134 who need to establish their grip on games			2
they have reached a stage in their careers where they must prove they are more than youthful promise			1
@entity144 was assured and looks to be slowly getting the hang of his role for @entity19			1
no - one but a fool would say @entity19 are about to rise to great heights			1
we would settle for : ‘ @entity19 could be better			2
but it will require an awful lot of players to grow up quickly and grasp responsibility and young @entity155 players have not been in the habit of doing that in recent years			1
your country needs you : @entity19 's young players must grasp responsibility and grow up quickly			1

@entity19 's young lions must prove they are more than youthful promise
@entity164 must grasp responsibility during big games
@entity19 looked fragile despite 1 - 0 *friendly* win against @entity70
