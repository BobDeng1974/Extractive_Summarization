security firm @entity1 repeatedly assured ministers that they would ' overshoot ' their targets for recruiting @entity6 security staff , the home secretary said today			1
@entity7 said the under - fire firm continually assured ministers that they would be able to recruit enough private security guards for the @entity6			2
but she added they had not ' deliberately deceived ' the government , telling mps that the firm made clear that the problem with ' workforce supply and scheduling ' only emerged ' over the last couple of weeks '			2
@entity1 only admitted they would fall short last week , when an extra 3,500 troops were called in			1
officers from nine forces will now join them to fill the shortfall			2
assurances : @entity7 tells @entity13 that @entity1 repeatedly told ministers that they would ' overshoot ' their recruitment targets attack : mrs may was forced to answer an urgent question submitted by shadow home secretary @entity31 @entity33 ’s former defence secretary @entity32 said the decision to send in the troops was taken ' ludicrously last minute ' and @entity37 mp @entity36 said @entity1 should have recruited more veterans to police the @entity6 in the first place			1
the home secretary was being grilled in the @entity41 after speaker @entity42 approved the request for an urgent question by shadow home secretary @entity31 , following claims that the @entity46 was warned about security problems at the @entity6 ten months ago			1
mrs may told @entity13 : ' @entity1 repeatedly assured us that they would overshoot their target			1
' @entity1 only told the government that they would be unable to meet their contractual arrangements last wednesday and we took immediate action			1
' @entity1 , which has seen its shares dive by as much as 10 per cent following the @entity6 security debacle , said venue security was being tightened ' before the full complement of accredited staff have been assigned '			1
' this situation is being rectified over the coming days , which should lead to the withdrawal of police officers from those roles assigned to private security , ' a @entity1 spokesman said			1
today 's @entity41 question came after a report by @entity68 highlighted a number of issues that needed to be addressed			2
but it was only last week that the home secretary told @entity73 that 3,500 extra troops were being drafted in because private security firm @entity1 could not deliver the promised number of guards			1
as the row escalated , culture secretary @entity77 defended @entity1 and the company ’s boss said he may have to quit over the fiasco			1
debacle : the home secretary , pictured meeting police chiefs at the @entity84 in @entity85 in july last year , told the @entity41 that the shortfall in @entity1 guards only became clear on wednesday call up : extra police have been drafted in to fill the gaps in @entity6 security caused by blundering private firm @entity1 mr @entity77 insisted it was ‘ completely normal ’ for contractors to fail to meet their commitments on major projects such as the @entity6			1
he insisted the firm had been ‘ quite honourable ’ and dismissed the problem as a ‘ hitch ’ which has now been dealt with			2
there are now claims that a further 2,400 troops - the equivalent of three battalions - will have to be drafted in to secure the @entity6 which open in just under a fortnight			1
it emerged today that the extra police will also have to be called on			0
assistant commissioner @entity107 , the @entity108 , said : ' nine venue forces have now deployed police officers to support security regimes at venues in their areas			0
' the forces involved are @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
mr @entity107 went on : ' whilst some of the activity police officers are undertaking was not anticipated , plans were put in place to allow us to do this			0
' forces are making sure they make the best use of their resources locally to do all they can to minimise the impact on local policing			0
' debacle : the officers will join an additional 3,500 troops who have been drafted in to help protect the olympic park @entity140 : @entity1 @entity141 ( above ) was also under intense pressure to explain why he only learned ' eight or nine days ago ' that his company was struggling to find the 10,000 staff it was contracted to provide for the @entity6 but @entity146 chairman @entity145 said it was ' chaos , absolute chaos '			1
the force has had to provide 150 officers per day to cover a hotel in @entity152 where footballers are staying , he said			0
' the worst - case scenario is that we end up having to find another 200 officers for the security at the @entity158 , and we 've yet to find out what the shortfall is in @entity161			2
it 's chaos , absolute chaos			0
' you should n't lose your local police officer because of the @entity6			0
communities are suffering because a private company has failed to deliver on a contract			2
' mr @entity77 refused to rule out the prospect and told @entity171 ’s @entity170 : ‘ @entity1 have been quite honourable			1
they have put their hands up			0
‘ the chief executive has said they got it wrong , they have apologised , they are going to cover all the costs , he has apologised to the troops who are going to be drafted in at the last moment			2
‘ i think it is completely normal that you are going to find some contractors on a project of this size who are n’t able to deliver what they promised			0
’ mr @entity77 denied that ministers had failed to supervise the contract properly , insisting they had received repeated assurances from @entity1 that it was on course to meet its commitment to provide 10,000 guards for the @entity6			1
@entity194 chairman @entity193 also said security would not be compromised by @entity1			2
he told the @entity171 : ‘ this actually was n’t about supply , they [ @entity1 ] have been interviewing about 100,000 people			2
‘ the reality is , and i can not put this any more simply , when they expected people to materialise they simply did n’t			0
that is why we moved quickly to stem that gap			0
’ prelude to the grand event : a troupe of ' extreme dancers ' hang from the @entity209 in @entity85 during the @entity210 today newfangled dangle : the performance , choreographed by @entity214 @entity213 , is taking taking place on several of @entity85 's landmarks prime minister @entity217 said the government had been monitoring potential @entity6 problems since it took power			0
deputy prime minister @entity222 added : ' it is being sorted out , it will be sorted out and we will deliver a secure @entity6			0
' @entity6 minister @entity226 said : ' in terms of the security numbers , i am as confident as i can be at this stage that the problems identified last week and the plans brought forward very quickly to deal with it will result in the delivery of secure and safe games			0
' a confidential report by @entity68 ( @entity68 ) warned about concerns over security 10 months ago , leading @entity6 organisers @entity239 to increase the number of security guards to be supplied by @entity1 from 2,000 to 10,400 while the value of the contract more than trebled from £ 86 million to £ 284 million			1
defence secretary @entity244 appeared to reject calls for soldiers to receive a £ 500 bonus for helping during the @entity6 , in line with those to @entity85 bus and tube staff			2
political storm : @entity255 chairman @entity254 ( left ) will be questioning mr @entity141 on tuesday about the debacle , a crisis culture secretary @entity77 ( right ) has dismissed as nothing more than a ' hitch ' he said : ‘ the @entity259 is a contingent organisation			1
people who join it expect to be asked at short notice to do tasks that they have not necessarily envisaged doing			0
’ mr @entity244 was confronted with the comments of an anonymous commanding officer on @entity267 ’s @entity266 who said he was angry that he had to tell his men they would be deployed at the @entity6 , just months after having to tell them that many of them could be made redundant			0
the officer said : ‘ they will be in camps without proper washing facilities			0
will we ever see a real strategy for the @entity259 , rather than cost - cutting dressed up as strategy ? ‘ our people deserve more than hollow platitudes			0
mr @entity244 will also be responding to scheduled @entity13 ' questions this afternoon , when he is expected to deal with some of the implications for the troops involved - such as the potential for awarding them a special medal and ensuring they do not lose out on leave			0
new alert : @entity291 officials today claimed terror suspects have been entering the @entity293 ahead of the @entity6 because inexperienced border staff are failing to carry out the proper security checks on guard : two @entity298 men show off their sniper rifles as the their helicopter hovers over @entity85 as part of the @entity6 security effort asked about reports that personnel who had not taken out holiday insurance could lose out financially , the spokesman said : ' we are very keen to ensure that absolutely no - one loses out as a result of this			1
' @entity1 have made clear that they will meet the costs associated with that extra deployment of troops			1
' @entity33 ’s deputy leader @entity313 claimed ministers had been ‘ dangerously incompetent ’ over @entity6 security			0
@entity1 ’s £ 830,000 - a - year boss @entity141 admitted he may be forced to quit in the wake of the fiasco which could cost the company up to £ 50million			1
he said : ‘ it ’s a big setback for us , we are really disappointed with how this has turned out			0
