this tiny feline could be about to enter the record books as the world 's shortest cat			1
@entity4 from @entity5 , @entity6 , is confident that her cat pixel is no more than five inches tall , although she 's yet to get official confirmation from @entity9			1
if it is verified , then @entity10 snatch the title of shortest adult cat to have ever lived , from @entity13 , a 5.35in tall @entity15 cat from @entity16			1
the average house cat is nine to ten inches tall			2
she wo n't be finishing that in a hurry trouble : @entity10 's owner says she has to take extra special care to avoid treading on her @entity15 cats ms @entity4 said her family of @entity34 cats ' win hearts over like crazy			1
' she said : ' even people that are n't cat people go crazy for them			2
they say about how cute they are and how they want to take them straight home with them			0
' a relatively new breed which was only recognised by @entity46 in 1995 , @entity15 cats are characterised by their short legs , which are caused by a naturally occurring genetic mutation			1
they was controversy when they first emerged , with some critics voicing concern over potential health problems			2
but ms @entity4 dismissed those concerns			0
' people who do n't understand the gene consider it a genetic defect or mutation or something of an abomination , ' she said			0
' it 's very unfair for them to say that			2
it 's natural for these cats to be this tall , just like it 's natural for some people to have brown eyes - it would n't be wrong for them to have blue eyes			0
' it 's their build and it 's natural for them to be built this way			0
' i want some : pixel looks like the kind of cat who might get in a fight with a gallon - jug of milk - and lose famous for 15 minutes : she looks much more confident taking on this @entity91 's can ( after @entity92 ... ) ' they win hearts over like crazy ' : ms @entity4 with @entity10 , who she is certain will be the world 's smallest cat however , she did concede that such tiny cats could cause problems around the house			1
' you ca n't leave doors open , you ca n't close refrigerator doors too quickly because one of them may have snuck up at the bottom of the door and stuck their head in , ' she said			0
' we have to move very slowly when we walk so we do n't step on anybody			0
' everyone of them has been stepped on or kicked once because it 's just what happens in a house of munchkin cats			0
' ms @entity4 is now waiting for verification from @entity9 before @entity10 can enter the record books			1
if she is accepted she would be following in a family tradition ; her mother , @entity120 , set a previous record in 2012 , at a height of six inches			0
the are measured form paw to shoulder .			1

the current world 's smallest cat measures up at 5.35in from paw to shoulder
both that one and @entity10 are munchkins , a new breed recognised in 1995
the breed 's *unusually* short legs have led to criticism on health grounds
