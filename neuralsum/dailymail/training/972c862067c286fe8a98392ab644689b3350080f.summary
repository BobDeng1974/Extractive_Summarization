an @entity1 politician has come under fire for suggesting on @entity3 that two aid workers captured by jihadists had consensual sex with their captors			1
@entity8 was referring to @entity9 , 21 , and @entity10 , 20 , who were captured by militants in @entity12 believed to be from @entity14 affiliated group @entity13 in august			1
here @entity9 is jostled by the press as she arrives home it ’s likely that his comment about money was a reference to claims that the @entity1 government paid the @entity44 extremists a £ 9million ransom to guarantee their release			1
however , mr @entity8 strenuously denied that he was suggesting the girls had sex with the jihadists			1
he claimed he had heard reports they had , and was merely asking if it was true , according to the @entity52			0
it reported he told @entity54 : ‘ a [ news ] site reported the two girls had told the authorities [ they had sex ]			0
@entity10 , second from left , and @entity9 , right , sit in a car as they leave a police station in @entity16 after being questioned about their harrowing experience @entity8 ( pictured ) found himself in hot water last year when he tweeted disparaging remarks about the @entity68 following @entity70 's @entity69 defeat to @entity1 ‘ i also wrote that i hoped it was n’t true			1
i simply noted the claim and asked if it was true			0
i did n’t state anything			0
’ last year he found himself in hot water after he posted an insult on his @entity3 account following @entity70 's @entity69 defeat			0
@entity8 labelled @entity68 people ' pretentious d * * * s ' just minutes after the final whistle of the 2 - 1 setback			2
diplomatic sources at the @entity84 in @entity16 said at the time that the reports were " highly insulting			0
" @entity8 , a member of disgraced former pm @entity86 's @entity87 , wrote : ' it 's always a pleasure to say ' go ... themselves " to the @entity68 ... pretentious and d * * * s. ' minutes later he posted another offending @entity3 writing : ' great game , great victory it 's great that it gets the @entity68 right in that place always arrogant and unbelievable			2
' his offensive postings were also heavily criticised by @entity1 on @entity3 with many saying it was ' hardly the language of a politician ' with others calling on him to apologise			2
instead @entity8 , who used to minister of communication in @entity86 's government , later wrote on his account : ' @entity103 , is that ok ?

@entity113 governments including @entity1 have long tolerated or facilitated ransom payments to secure the release of hostages although the practice has frequently been denied officially			2
