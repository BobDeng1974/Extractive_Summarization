by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 13:18 est , 17 january 2014 as ubiquitous as @entity3 and as inextricably part of the internet ’s dna , @entity2 is a multibillion dollar company built on one man ’s fear of regret			2
twenty years ago , founder @entity10 , then 30 , cast his mind forward and asked himself what regrets he had in his life			1
he realized , he later recalled , ‘ if i ’d ignored the emergence of the internet just as it was happening … i ’d be a fool			0
’ this year @entity2 celebrates its 20th anniversary just as @entity10 celebrates his 50th			2
it is hard to believe that a man so driven would defer acting to get something he truly wanted			0
it 's what makes his inaction on the matter of his biological father all the more pointed			1
bullish , driven and determined : @entity10 founded @entity2 in a bid to live life without regrets it is three months since @entity31 , 69 , owner of a small biker repair shop in @entity33 , was publicly revealed as @entity10 's estranged father			1
but now , speaking to @entity35 , he has admitted that he has been forced to set aside the notion that @entity10 would show some sign of welcoming the older man ’s desire to reconnect with him			1
speaking from his home in @entity41 mr @entity31 said : ‘ i do n’t think he will come to me now			1
i have n’t heard a word for him or had any sign that he wants to connect with me			0
i hoped with the publicity it might happen but i ca n’t blame him			0
i guess i was n’t a very good father			2
’ mr @entity31 was revealed as @entity10 ’s biological father last october			1
he only learned the identity of the son he last saw when he was barely one year old when approached by a writer working on a biography of the billionaire			0
reporter @entity57 , author of ' @entity58 : @entity10 and @entity2 , ' tracked mr @entity31 down to a small bike repair shop in @entity33 in 2012			1
he was stunned to discover that mr @entity31 had no idea who @entity10 was or his intimate connection to him			1
then and now : @entity31 was a teenage unicyclist ( left ) when his son @entity63 was born , and he only learned that the boy grew up to be @entity10 last year ( pictured right this year , at age 69 ) unlike his son who has mapped out his life according to what he calls ‘ a regret minimalization framework , ’ mr @entity31 revealed that he is riven with thoughts of what might have been			1
now in less than good health , he said that an awareness of his own mortality has made him feel the need to meet his son – his only biological child – more keenly			1
he said : ‘ i ’m anxious about it			0
i would like to connect with him			0
i ’m not in great health			0
i do n’t plan on dying just yet but it does make me think , it plays a part in wanting to see him			0
‘ i ’m his biological father and i just want to shake his hand and tell him he ’s done well and be recognised as his father			1
father of choice not birth : @entity89 with @entity10 's mother @entity90			1
he adopted @entity91 at the age of four and is the only father the billionaire has ever known ‘ i would want that no matter what he turned out to be			0
’ @entity10 was recently listed number 15 in @entity99 ’s list of @entity100 , he ranks 12 in the @entity99 and his estimated worth is $ 27.5billion			2
but mr @entity31 insisted : ‘ i just want to see him as my son , just to have him acknowledge that i ’m his father and he ’s my son			1
‘ other than that i do n’t want anything from him			0
i do n’t want to push my way in or push the other dad out of the way			0
i ’d just like to see him			0
’ mr @entity31 and @entity10 ’s mother @entity90 were just teenagers when she fell pregnant in @entity110 , @entity111			1
mr @entity31 was 18 and a unicyclist and rising star on the niche circuit			2
he and @entity90 were married for two years before she left , taking their infant son with her			1
according to mr @entity119 : ‘ i had a number but @entity10 ’s mother asked me not to interfere so i did n’t want to call			1
‘ i used to wonder all the time though whatever happened to @entity10			2
then i just reached a point where i thought he was long gone			0
that was the only child i ever had – that makes a difference too			0
the last time i saw him he was in diapers			0
’ when her son was four , @entity10 ’s mother married @entity89 who adopted @entity10 as his own			1
mr @entity31 is now married to wife , @entity131 , and is stepfather to her four adult sons			1
all or nothing man : @entity10 , pictured with wife @entity135 , founded the ' everything store ' but seems to want nothing to do with his biological father			1
at first the couple decided not to tell them about the identity of their half - brother			0
but early last year they changed their minds			0
watching footage of their famous half - sibling the family were stunned to hear that @entity10 shares the same distinctive , braying , laugh as his biological father			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ we have the same laugh it ’s true and it was very strange to hear that			2
i wonder what other things we share in common			0
’ he added ; ‘ i regret that i was n’t a better father			2
i wonder how things might have been different			0
' and though the founder of the ' everything store ' has given every impression of wanting nothing to do with the man to whom he owes his existence , mr @entity31 said he still held out hope			2
he said : ' but i do still hope to meet him even once			0
i have n't made my big plunge yet but i plan to			0
' more than a year after learning who his son is and what he has become it is hard not to hear this vow as a hollow echo of the one made by @entity172 last october			2
and hard not to feel that unlike his son , mr @entity31 need not cast his mind very far forward to answer the question ' what regrets do i have in my life ? '			1

@entity31 , 69 , was revealed as @entity10 's biological father three months ago
@entity10 's mother , @entity90 , had him when she was a teenager and was married to his father for just two years
speaking to @entity182 admitted his hopes for contact with @entity10 have so far been in vain
said he wants nothing from his son but to be recognised as his father
is filled with regret over the estrangement and always wondered what had become of his boy
*claimed* his own poor health made his need to see his son more pressing
