@entity0 claims that he posed as a black man while he applied to medical schools in 1998 because he believed he had a better chance of gaining acceptance the older brother of comedienne @entity6 has controversially claimed he was only accepted into medical school in the late 1990s because he posed as a black man			1
writing on his blog , almost black , @entity0 says that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the @entity11 and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the @entity13			1
' i was determined to become a doctor and i knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were , let 's say â€¦ less stringent ? ' wrote @entity0			1
' i got into medical school because i said i was black			1
the funny thing is i 'm not			0
' @entity0 admits that his sister did not support him during his social experiment and specifically asked him not to do it			0
he claims in 1998 he shaved his head , trimmed his ' long @entity27 eyelashes ' and joined the @entity28 during the process			1
his change in appearance was ' so startling that my own fraternity brothers did n't recognize me '			0
' @entity0 the @entity27 - @entity13 frat boy became @entity34 the @entity36 applicant to medical school , ' he said , claiming that @entity34 was the middle name he was born with			1
though his website , @entity40 , shows side - by - side qualifications and pictures of @entity0 as an @entity27 - @entity13 man ( left ) and a black man ( right ) , he does n't specify if he went through the same application process as an @entity47 - @entity13 man as he did a black man as an @entity49 with a gpa of 3.1 , @entity51 of 31 and a member of the @entity53 , he did n't think he 'd get into medical school , but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization , he thought he could get in to some of the top schools in the nation			1
' i became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in @entity13 , including @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68 , ' he said about the application process			2
' in all , i interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across @entity13 , while posing a black man , ' he added			1
despite his startling claims , @entity0 fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an @entity27 - @entity13 man			1
he also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise have gone to an @entity77			0
when he was finally accepted to @entity11 , he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was ' wrong ' with affirmative action			1
@entity0 said that his sister , sitcom star and comedienne @entity6 told him not to move forward with the book indeed , @entity0 admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor			2
@entity0 - @entity0 also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating			2
' not everything worked out as planned , ' he wrote on his website			2
store clerks accused me of shoplifting			0
women were either scared of me or could n't keep their hands off me			0
what started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment			1
' unsurprisingly , @entity0 has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims			0
the @entity107 claims that though his experience ' revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism ' , he did n't bring everything he could to the table			0
' he chooses to sidestep , downplay , or flat - out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations , ' @entity113 wrote			2
' it 's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who ' gets it ' , while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary , ' he added			1
and though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man , he does n't specify if he went through the application process as an @entity13 - @entity27 man			1
' @entity0 seems to have assumed that he would 've gotten nowhere as an @entity27 @entity13 applicant and dove head first into this poorly - conceived ' experiment ' before determining otherwise , ' @entity113 wrote			1
and more so , @entity113 claims that @entity0 's experiment ' is insulting to what black people endure in this country , both institutionally and culturally '			2
@entity113 claims : ' and as a person of color , it 's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies			0
' black people ca n't be as ' racist ' as whites societally , mr. @entity0			0
you did n't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black - owned and operated hospitals			2
' and a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work			0
' the attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false ' equality ' is truly regrettable			0
but when you conduct social ' experiments ' that cite @entity172 @entity171 's @entity170 as an inspiration , it 's obvious that you do n't take these issues all that seriously			0
