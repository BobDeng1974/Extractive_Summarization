by @entity0 @entity1 do not need a big - name boss to lure the best players to @entity4 in the wake of @entity7 ’ sacking , says @entity8			1
the former @entity1 defender insists it is irrelevant who the manager is at @entity4 , all that matters is the results			2
@entity1 struggled in the transfer market last summer , and may find it tough again in the coming months without @entity20 football next season			0
failed : @entity7 ( right ) blew his big chance at @entity1 with a series of colourless displays in defeat aura : @entity25 is a big enough personality to deal with @entity1 stars such as @entity28 @entity8 told @entity29 : ‘ the reality of it is that it does n’t really matter who the manager is			1
what matters most to @entity1 fans is that they actually win football matches and get back to where they belong			0
‘ the suggestion that they need a big manager to attract players to the club , i find that a bit sad to be fair			2
‘ the idea that @entity1 need to have a sort - of figurehead to be able to attract players is a nonsense as far as i ’m concerned			1
‘ @entity1 , as a football club , is big enough in its own right to be able to attract players - and they should be			1
‘ it seems to be pointing in that direction and i suppose at the start of next season , if they can spend the money that they have wisely and there ’s a new big - name manager then times will be exciting again			0
’ inexperienced : @entity61 has won a title but has no real knowledge of how to spend £ 200m man for any job : @entity66 would do a very good job for a number of @entity70 clubs option : given the right circumstances , @entity72 would be interested in the @entity1 job			0

it does *n't* matter who the next manager of @entity1 is , says @entity8
it *'s* nonsense to say @entity1 need a figurehead to attract players
if they spend big there are exciting times *ahead* , insists @entity4 *legend*
