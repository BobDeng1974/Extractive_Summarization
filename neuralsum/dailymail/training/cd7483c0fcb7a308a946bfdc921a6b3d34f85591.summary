while it is not clear what form the technology takes , mr @entity27 has previously said that he hopes it could one day be built into a pair of glasses , in which case , @entity2 may aim on incorporating ' cinematic reality ' into future iterations of @entity131 ( pictured ) last month , @entity157 unveiled its @entity171 model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor , and now features 360 - degree tracking			1
reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $ 200 ( £ 122 ) the 360 - degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer 's head movements , which in turn will make games more immersive and true - to - life			2
