' @entity12 rep. @entity11 , who chairs the powerful @entity13 , wrote to attorney general @entity14 to demand what he called ' a serious investigation ' – something he said has been lacking			2

' the november 9 , 2012 email exchange with an unnamed colleague – the person 's name was redacted in the copy @entity47 's staff released publicly – took place while @entity0 was in the @entity49			1
' overheard some ladies talking about @entity51 [ s ] today , ' @entity0 wrote			1
' according to them we 've bankrupted ourselves and a [ re ] through			1
we 'll never be able to pay off our debt and are going down the tubes			0
' turning sarcastic , @entity0 pounced on her @entity49 acquaintances			1
' they do n't seem to see that they ca n't afford to keep up their welfare state either , ' she wrote			2
' the conversation turned ugly when @entity0 's writing companion let loose first on conservatives			1
' well , you should hear the whacko wing of the @entity6 , ' the person replied			0
' the @entity51 is through ; too many foreigners sucking the teat ; time to hunker down , buy ammo and food , and prepare for the end			2
' ' the right wing radio shows are scary to listen to			0
' ' great , ' @entity0 wrote back			1
' maybe we are through if there are that many a * * holes			1
' ' and i 'm talking about the hosts of the shows , ' came the reply			0
' the callers are rabid			0
' in the final message of the exchange , @entity0 wrote that ' we do n't need to worry about [ illegal ] alien terrorists			1
it 's our own crazies that will take us down			2
' @entity0 's visit to the @entity49 coincided with a management shakeup at the @entity1			1
on the day of the email exchange , then - @entity1 commissioner @entity89 left office at the conclusion of his appointed term and deputy commissioner @entity95 took over			2
foot - dragging : @entity11 says attorney general @entity14 has n't undertaken a serious investigation of @entity0 and the @entity98 administration 's @entity1 @entity95 would resign seven months later after the @entity100 scandal broke wide open and president @entity98 pledged publicly to ' hold the responsible parties accountable			1
' i ’ll do everything in my power to make sure nothing like this happens again , ' @entity98 said			0
in @entity106 months earlier , @entity0 emailed of a friday morning meeting with ' internal " spooks " ' in an unnamed government agency			1
then she took some leisure time			0
' @entity111 [ d ] work this morning			2
got to talk to their internal " spooks " , ' she wrote			2
i was going to take the train to @entity115 , but stuff closes early in winter so it was n't going to work			0
instead , went [ to ] @entity117 – an @entity119 @entity106 village , full of beautiful , huge houses – which have been ruined by letting the @entity121 [ sic ] live there ! these people have ruined everything with their equality push ! ' ' tonight [ i 'm ] going to a movie and dinner with [ redacted ] and her partner			2
tomorrow at 8am , i get on a tour bus to go to @entity115 , @entity131 and @entity132 ( or is it @entity134 ? )			0
figured i may never get the chance otherwise and have always wanted to see @entity131			0
' ' then , ' she added , ' hopefully a nice dinner and bed to be ready for the trip home			0
am being good -- no shopping			0
everything is super expensive even if the dollar and pound were equal			0
' @entity0 pleaded the @entity146 twice in 2013 and 2014 in @entity13 hearings , refuding to answer questions about her role in targeting conservative groups on the basis of words like ' tea party ' and ' patriots ' in their names			1
after determining that she had waived that right by making a self - serving opening statement , @entity13 @entity6 carried a vote to find her in contempt of @entity159 and referred her to the @entity160 for prosecution			0
@entity14 , who heads the @entity160 , has taken no action .			0

@entity0 *slammed* right - of - *center* @entity51 in an email to a colleague in 2012 , seven months before the tea - party targeting scandal broke

' we do n't need to worry about [ illegal ] alien terrorists , ' she *snarked* : ' it 's our own crazies that will take us down '
@entity0 presided over years of alleged partisan *discrimination* against conservative groups that applied for nonprofit tax benefits
