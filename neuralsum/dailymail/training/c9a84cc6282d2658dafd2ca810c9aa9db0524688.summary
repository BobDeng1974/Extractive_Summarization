@entity0 may not have found a house yet , but he looks completely at home with @entity3			1
the @entity4 has been staying at the swanky @entity5 since his deadline day arrival at @entity8 and his football is as stylish as the five - star decor			2
take just one moment from the match at @entity13 , three minutes after half - time			1
picked out by @entity15 in the corner of the penalty box , @entity0 controlled instantly , almost magnetically			2
@entity0 performed well on his first start for @entity3 but the team were embarrassed as @entity13 fought back from 3 - 1 down to win 5 - 3 thanks to some atrocious defending @entity0 tormented @entity21 in the @entity13 back line but @entity3 eventually succumbed @entity0 clashes with @entity13 's veteran midfielder @entity23 during the first half @entity0 prepares to kick off with @entity25 and @entity15 after @entity13 made the scores 3 - 3 passes - 27 passing accuracy - 88.9 % passing accuracy in @entity13 half - 83.3 % balls recovered - 4 assists - 1 hit woodwork - 1 blocked shots - 1 successful crosses - 100 % allowing the ball to bounce to the optimal height , he extended his leg with nonchalance			1
the ball cannoned back off the crossbar , @entity43 without a hope of stopping it			0
he barely even saw it			0
@entity0 did n't score during his 70 minutes at @entity13 - it 's a matter of time before the goals start to flow - but his influence in leading @entity3 's attack is there for all to see			1
@entity3 are starting to feel themselves again , going forward at least			0
defensively they were a shambles and they blew a 3 - 1 lead in embarrassing circumstances , but that formidable forward line is starting to purr again			1
the ' @entity57 ' are blowing away the dark clouds of the @entity60 era with hurricane force and @entity13 certainly found themselves in a whirlwind at times on sunday			0
for an hour at least , until @entity3 suffered a power cut at the @entity65			0
to their eternal credit , @entity67 's team had hung in there and surged back to claim a famous victory			0
@entity3 were woeful in defence , their expensive attacking players left looking helpless as @entity13 split open their defence at will			1
@entity0 struck the crossbar with this effort three minutes into the second half @entity0 congratulates @entity77 on his superb chip to put @entity3 2 - 0 up @entity0 gets the better of @entity13 duo @entity79 and @entity23 @entity0 's heat map from the match shows how he popped up all over the field to spark @entity3 's attack @entity0 delivered the cross for @entity86 's opening goal for @entity3 on 12 minutes before the miraculous fightback , @entity0 , on his first start , had been central to everything good @entity3 did			1
the speed with which he has adapted to life in a red shirt is incredible , it looked like he 'd been playing alongside @entity15 , @entity25 and @entity77 for years			2
twice inside the space of a minute early on , @entity94 tried to locate him with a diagonal ball from the left			0
it did n't quite come off but the threat was evident as @entity0 tangled with @entity21 and @entity100			0
and his contribution to the opening goal , on 12 minutes , was simply sublime			0
collecting the ball wide on the left , he spun @entity105 as though he was invisible and set off like an express train			0
a sumptuous left - footed cross to the back post followed and @entity109 headed in with the aid of a deflection off @entity112			2
and on the stroke of half - time , a @entity94 ball from the same flank was nearly met by @entity0 as he dived forward to meet it			1
@entity0 gave @entity13 right - back @entity105 a torrid time as he led @entity3 's attack @entity0 shakes hands with @entity15 prior to the kick - off at the @entity65 his primary purpose is to score goals , of course , but @entity0 has a much greater value than that			1
he will be a key component in @entity3 's well - oiled attacking machine			2
his passing and movement was superb , weaving in and out of the thin blue line			0
his industry raises eyebrows too - time after time he rushed back to mug an unsuspecting @entity13 player of the ball in the centre of the park			2
although the serious cruciate ligament injury that kept him out of the @entity140 is behind him , @entity0 is still short of full match fitness and it was unsurprising when @entity143 replaced him with @entity144 with 20 minutes to play			1
it was at that point @entity3 's afternoon imploded			0
if @entity143 's attack is the luxury penthouse suite , his defence is the grotty back street hostel			0
if @entity3 's philosophy this season is to score one more than the opposition , whether that means scoring four , five or six , then at least in @entity0 he has someone who will deliver			1

@entity0 controls the bouncing ball on his chest as @entity160 stands guard behind him 9min - twice within the space of a minute , @entity94 tries to pick out @entity0 with a long diagonal pass 11 - @entity0 beats @entity160 in the corner and drives into the box			2
his low ball across the edge of the six yard box evades @entity109 12 - goal : @entity0 spins @entity160 wide on the left and leaves him for dead with a burst of pace			1
he produced a sumptuous left - footed cross to the back post where @entity109 heads in 23 - @entity0 tries to play in @entity109 with a chip - the wrong choice with a free man out wide 37 - @entity94 plays it in to @entity0 but his attempted lay - off is just behind the onrushing @entity15 44 - @entity94 's left - wing cross reaches @entity0 in the middle but he ca n't direct a header on target 48 - moment of class as he controls a @entity15 ball , allows the ball to bounce and then fires against the crossbar with @entity43 beaten 70 - is replaced by @entity144 @entity189 wants long - term @entity3 stay			1

@entity0 made his first start for @entity3 at @entity13
the @entity4 looked *impressive* and set up first goal
his cross from the left was met by @entity25 to score
@entity0 struck the crossbar in the second half with *glorious* shot
he was subbed off on 70 minutes and replaced by @entity144
@entity3 were 3 - 1 up but lost 5 - 3 as their defence *crumbled*
