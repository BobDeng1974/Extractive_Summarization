' a spokesman from the @entity13 said : ' we take these allegations very seriously			1
we condemn any behaviour that promotes terrorism and violence on any of our campuses			0
' we have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community , who come to study from over 150 nations			2
' any student found to be engaging in radicalised activity would be referred to disciplinary procedures			2
' as a @entity23 - based university operating in a diverse multi-cultural city , we are fully aware of all the influences within this international city			2
with other universities in @entity23 , we are working together to implement the government ’s @entity91 strategy to tackle extremism			2
' we strongly encourage anyone who is concerned about radicalisation to speak out and contact the @entity96 and well - being team			2
the safety and security of our students is our foremost concern			2

having been brought up in a @entity16 household and then seeing that happening is pretty galling stuff			0
’ universities across the country , the @entity13 in particular , are being targeted by radical recruiters			1
these guys [ students ] are being professionally radicalised			0
they tried it with me and they try it with any @entity16			0

when you are 18 - years - old and a practising @entity16 you feel inclined to go			0
i went along and saw what was happening and it absolutely disgusted me			0
this afternoon , a spokesman for the university said : ‘ tonight ’s event has been postponed due to increased sensitivity and security concerns			1
’ the @entity13 has been criticised for segregating male and female students during talks by @entity52 scholars			1
it was one of 21 university institutions which were found to promote gender segregation			2
research by @entity184 , a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities , said that from september to march 2013 , 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated			0
at the @entity13 , at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘ women only ’			1
the research found that on march 21 , 2013 a debate entitled ‘ @entity195 ’ was held by the women ’s take on @entity197 ( @entity198 ) , a @entity200 front group , and featured @entity201 as a speaker			2
when challenged by students as to why the @entity198 was able to hold events segregated by gender , the student union interfaith officer allegedly claimed that the society ’s events were ‘ faith - based ’ , which exempted it from equal opportunities policy			2
in addition to this , an event the following day was held by the @entity52 called ‘ @entity214 in @entity135 ’ which was also advertised as ‘ sisters only ’			1
it was logged by @entity184 for this reason			0
student rights said that when a male student from the society complained about not being able to attend , the @entity52 highlighted that segregated events were common on campus stating ‘ we ’ve had many brothers only events too ... the information discussed in the only women talks / or notes can be put to the public after the talk ... the topics at hand do not only concern women			1
’ the @entity13 ’s ‘ @entity232 at @entity233 ’ states that : ‘ the @entity13 is committed to creating a stimulating , supportive , inclusive and accessible learning and working environment ... @entity237 has a legal responsibility to provide a healthy and safe working environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment			1
’ a spokesperson from the @entity13 said : ' the university does not allow gender segregation and it will not tolerate this type of prejudice			1
the university strictly complies with the @entity248 the @entity249			0
' the events concerned were not gender segregated events			0
many organisations and universities host events which are of interest to women and open to all women , such as feminist groups and women in business networking events			0
' 56 % of our international student community are women			0
' @entity265 is one of many societies that are part of the @entity268 which is an independent body			0
' @entity265 is one of many societies that are part of the @entity268 which is an independent body			0
' @entity237 does not control its activities but does monitor that it is legally compliant			0
' it has been reported dr @entity275 said gays should be outlawed , terror boss @entity124 will go to heaven and has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation , but he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted			0
