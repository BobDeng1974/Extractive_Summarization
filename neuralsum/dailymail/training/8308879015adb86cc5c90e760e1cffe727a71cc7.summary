by @entity0 published : 00:33 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 02:45 est , 20 september 2013 smoking is set to be banned in all prisons in @entity4 and @entity5 , sparking fears inmates may riot when they are stopped from lighting up , it emerged last night			1
as of next year , prisoners will be unable to smoke in all parts of the jails – including exercise yards			1
they are expected to be offered nicotine patches to help satisfy their cravings			0
a pilot project will begin next spring , before being introduced in other prisons during a 12 - month period			1
new ban : a smoking ban is set to be introduced in prisons across the country after staff complained they were being forced to breathe in the second - hand smoke of inmates those in the @entity25 , including @entity26 and @entity27 , will pilot the ban on all tobacco products			1
the @entity30 confirmed they were considering banning smoking ‘ across the prison estate and as part of this are looking at possible sites as early adopters ’			2
figures show about 80 per cent of the 84,300 inmates smoke and tobacco is a valuable currency that is traded on the wings			1
some jails already ban the habit for bad behaviour but the uniform ban is likely to anger those ‘ well - behaved ’ inmates who look forward to their cigarette breaks out in the yard to help them through the boredom of their sentences			1
the rule change comes after a campaign by staff , who have long objected to breathing in the second - hand smoke of inmates			2
it also comes amid fears that the @entity30 could face compensation claims from officers who claim that they are victims of passive smoking			0
the 2007 smoking ban designed to protect people from the effects of second - hand smoke in public places did not apply to prison cells			1
senior prison staff were said to have been informed of the move in a letter this month			0
pilot : @entity70 is one of the prisons in the @entity25 to be taking part in a smoking ban pilot ‘ you will no doubt be aware that the decision has been made that the time is right for the prison estate to adopt a tobacco and smoke - free policy to provide a smoke - free workplace / environment for our staff and prisoners , ’ it reportedly said in the @entity76			1
the letter said that as a first step a number of establishments in the @entity25 ‘ will become early adopters of the scheme ’			2
they would implement a complete ban on all tobacco products in late march or early april next year			0
@entity95 , general secretary of the @entity96 , welcomed the smoking ban but told @entity76 its implementation would be difficult			1
he said : ' there is no pretending otherwise			0
it could cause disturbances but they have done it successfully in @entity104 and in young offender institutions in @entity4 and @entity5			0
' he added : ‘ we welcome this move			0
it is our policy to have smoke - free prisons for our members			2
we will work with the ministry to make sure it works effectively			0
’ one prison source said of the timetable for imposing the ban : ‘ i am not sure it is the right time			0
' everything in jails is extremely stretched and more job losses are coming			0

a pilot project in prisons across the @entity25 will begin next spring
it will ban smoking in all parts of the jail - including exercise yards
about 80 *%* of inmates smoke and tobacco is a valuable prison currency
but some are *concerned* the smoking ban could cause ' disturbances '
