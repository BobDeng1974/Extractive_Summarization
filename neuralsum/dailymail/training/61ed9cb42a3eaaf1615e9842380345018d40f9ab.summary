by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:56 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 10 may 2013 the dna of @entity4 kidnapping suspect @entity3 was provided to the state crime lab yesterday afternoon and entered into a database to see if they can link the accused rapist to any more crimes			1
the @entity11 lab staff is rushing the dna testing to provide investigators with results			0
the process usually takes around 22 days , but the lab can complete the testing in 24 to 48 hours if necessary			0
the @entity18 will find out later today if there are any matches with any profiles in the database			0
@entity24 schoolgirl @entity23 , 14 , pictured left , was kidnapped and murdered in 1981			1
lawyers are now investigating whether @entity3 , pictured right , who was this week accused of the kidnap and rape of three other @entity24 girls , was also responsible for the abduction of ms @entity32 since @entity3 has never been convicted of a crime , his dna would not be stored in state or national databases			1
some dna profiles in the databases are from unknown individuals who left behind their genetic fingerprint at a crime scene , such as a rape , murder or burglary , reported @entity45			2
one crime that lawyers believe @entity3 may have responsible for is the murder of a newspaper delivery girl in the 1980s			1
@entity53 ' @entity52 ' @entity51 was convicted and jailed in 1981 for the kidnapping , rape and murder of @entity24 schoolgirl @entity23			1
but @entity51 has always maintained his innocence and lawyers are now looking into the possibility of whether the main suspect in the recent @entity24 kidnapping case may in fact be responsible for the death of 14 - year - old ms @entity32			1
now lawyers from the @entity66 's @entity65 , who have been working to clear @entity51 ' name , are looking into whether @entity3 could also be behind the abduction of @entity23			1
@entity65 director @entity70 told @entity45 : ' there were so many similarities , that 's what piqued our interest			2
' in prison : @entity53 ' @entity77 was found guilty by a jury of the kidnap , rape and murder of @entity32 but he has always maintained his innocence the lawyers point out that while ms @entity32 was kidnapped years before @entity3 's alleged victims , @entity51 was a similar age to @entity3 and lived in the same area when he was charged with her murder			1
ms @entity23 was abducted while delivering @entity45 newspapers and her body was found four months later in an abandoned house on @entity90 near @entity91 28th street			1
she was tied up and had been sexually assaulted before being murdered			0
lawyers working on @entity51 case , who has already served more than 30 years in prison , claim there was no physical evidence to link @entity51 to the crime			1
detectives also found hairs found on ms @entity102 's body which were ' dissimilar ' to both those of @entity51 and the murdered teen			1
now with samples of @entity3 's dna , they may be able to link him to the murder if he is responsible			1
in 1985 , two @entity45 reporters wrote an investigative piece looking into the case which found jurors said @entity51 ' conviction was based mainly on the evidence of a convicted criminal who later changed his story			1
another witness later admitted to lying for reward money			0
lawyers also highlighted that hispanic @entity51 was featured in a lineup with all black suspects when witnessed had reported seeing two or three hispanic men chasing ms @entity32			1
they also pointed out that witnesses claimed he was driving a car even though @entity51 could n't drive and always used the bus for transport			2
@entity128 , a spokeswoman for the state office , told @entity24 , com : ' we have long believed in @entity52 's innocence , but had n't been able to find any leads as to who the actual perpetrators may have been			1
' the similarities between the details emerging ( in the abduction case ) and @entity32 ' abduction and murder are striking , and have us wondering whether this might be the break in @entity52 's case we 've been waiting for			1
' @entity3 is currently in prison after a judge at @entity144 set his bond at $ 8 million			2
@entity146 and , right , an ' age - progressed ' rendering of her , as might would look now at 19 @entity146 is another missing @entity4 girl whose disappearance was believed to have been linked to @entity3 and @entity3 ' disappearance			2
she was 14 - years - old on july 6 , 2007 , when she was reported missing from her home in the same neighborhood where @entity152 and @entity153 had vanished			0
initially @entity146 was considered a runaway as she had lived with her great - uncle and they had argued prior to her disappearance			0
but a year later the police and @entity18 believed @entity146 was an ‘ endangered juvenile ’ who could be ‘ being held again her will			0
’ in 2009 , the @entity18 said they suspected a link between @entity146 ’s disappearance and those of @entity152 and @entity153			0
@entity146 's physical appearance and the proximity of her home to the other disappearances lead investigators to suspect the cases were linked and that all three might have been kidnapped by the same man			2
special agent @entity173 , of the @entity18 @entity174 told @entity45 on tuesday that @entity146 remains in their thoughts as they gather evidence at @entity3 's @entity180 home			2
‘ we are keeping @entity146 in our thoughts as we go every step of the way , ’ she said			0
‘ whether it is something we find at the house , or someone seeing the stories remembers something , we continue our search for @entity146			0

it was not clear why a cadaver dog might be needed , or if it found anything amiss			0
prior to the disclosure of the naming of the women discovered on monday , @entity146 ’ family had briefly thought their daughter could be amongst those discovered			0
' we 're hoping that it 's connected , and they knew where she was , ' her aunt @entity207 told @entity212			0
' we 're hoping for a miracle			0
' the @entity146 family is renewing their efforts to publicize @entity146 's disappearance			0
