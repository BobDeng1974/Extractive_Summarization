the hit happened at @entity27 , near @entity28 , in the southern @entity30 region of @entity31 - popular with @entity33 holidaymakers - and in the heartland of the local mafia known as the @entity36 mafia hitmen have shot dead a convicted mobster , his girlfriend and her two - year - old son after forcing them off the road in high speed chase ' we are investigating all possibilities - although we believe that @entity7 was probably the intended target we have to remember that his partner was also married to a murdered criminal			1
' there could be several motives revenge or drugs both @entity7 and @entity53 had connections to drugs trafficking and they were both involved with organised crime			0
' the only witnesses are the two children who are in a secret location with police and hopefully they will be able to give us some clues			2
' it is not the first time that children have been innocent victims as a result of mob hits - earlier this year another three year old boy was murdered after gunmen targeted a car he was travelling in killing two men as well			1
police revealed @entity11 , was named after his father who was shot dead three months before he was born			1
they said he was two and a half adding that he would have turned three in august			0
the other two children were named as @entity119 , seven and @entity120 , six			2
@entity123 , the headteacher of the primary school they attended , said : ' we must now think of them , all our thoughts are with @entity119 and @entity120			0
they are two lovely boys and so was little @entity11			1
' the whole family has been marred by tragedy , first the father , now the mother and her youngest child			1
we must protect them from the terrible memories that they will have and that will probably never leave them			0
' today even the @entity30 pm @entity138 expressed his shock at the killings saying : ' this is a painful atrocity and i feel it first as a father and then as premier , ' adding that he had been in touch with @entity28 's police chief for a full briefing on the shootings			0
@entity149 , president of the @entity30 parliament anti mafia commission , said : ' this slaughter at @entity28 with the murder of a child , shows even if it were still necessary the brutality of mafia violence , they know no morals			2
' this is confirmation that there is no mafia code and it has never existed			0
they have always killed , even women and children			2
i hope that those responsible are caught quickly as well as those that ordered this slaughter			0
this murders must be stopped and punished quickly			0
' my thought go also to the two children who escaped this slaughter			2
now they must have the support of the institutional authorities to rebuild their lives as quickly as possible to guarantee them some sort of future and normal life , avoiding that they are conditioned by crime			0
' the interior minister @entity181 deployed 60 extra officers to the area to help in the hunt for the killers and ensure law and order was maintained			0
local priest father @entity188 , of @entity189 , who knew the victims said : ' there are no words to describe this			0
i am not going to get involved in the background of their private lives - an adult can make a mistake and answer to his conscience but a two and a half year old child ? there is no need to comment further			2
' mayor @entity204 said : ' i think @entity9 was killed because she was going out with @entity7			1
she was killed because of who she knew and who she was seeing			0
' there was nothing about her linked to organised crime - her children were her life			0
this is a painful act , ferocious act which has claimed innocent victims and leaves the town a little worried			0
drugs are an increasing problem here and in the surrounding area and we need more police			0
' locals in the town also said that @entity9 had testified against the two men who had killed her husband and who had been jailed for life prompting speculation that may also have been a motive .			1
