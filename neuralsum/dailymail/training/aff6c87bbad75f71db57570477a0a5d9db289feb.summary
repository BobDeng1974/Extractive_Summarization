‘ i searched for a team where he can be an important player without being asked to lead , ’ said @entity5 , who also represents @entity16 and @entity17			1
now it 's up to him			0
another flop is not recommended			0
‘ not everyone is born to be a leader and often good strikers are not good leaders			0
@entity2 needs to get out from behind this pressure so he can feel free to score goals			2
’ when asked if @entity0 was @entity2 ’s last resort , @entity5 said : ‘ at the highest level , yes			1
it is all or nothing			0
‘ @entity2 is 24 years old			2
he can no longer use his age as an excuse			2
’ adoring fans : a crowd of @entity0 supporters waited at the club 's training ground to meet the attacker pedigree : @entity2 led the line for @entity36 at the @entity64 in @entity65 but they crashed out at the group stage @entity5 , who was speaking to @entity7 via @entity68 from @entity69 , said @entity0 had been watching @entity2 for three months after it became clear the striker needed to cut his ties with @entity34			1
