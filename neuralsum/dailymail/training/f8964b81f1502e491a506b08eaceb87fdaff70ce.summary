by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 8 february 2013 a children 's playground at a smart new housing development has been sealed off for months - because it is too brightly coloured			1
the play area was a major attraction to families who paid up to £ 500,000 for properties on the @entity9 estate in the @entity10			1
but when it was completed last summer , a handful of locals complained that the size and colour scheme of the playground were not ' in keeping ' with the upmarket area			1
closed : families living locally have said the promised playground was the reason they bought a house there @entity22 with son @entity23 , two , and daughter @entity24 , four , says ' the only people complaining are those without children ' developer @entity28 erected a metal fence around the site and vowed to repaint the swings and climbing frames , which are primarily red , green , blue and yellow			1
but the area has remained sealed off ever since - and @entity28 is now seeking planning permission to change the colour scheme and relocate some of the equipment			1
@entity22 , 33 , who lives opposite the park , said her four - year - old daughter and two - year - old son are desperate to play on the equipment			1
she said : ' people have complained that it was too brightly coloured and not in keeping with the local colour scheme			0
' @entity28 offered to take it away and paint it dark green			2
then people started complaining it was too big and that it could distract drivers going past			0
' it 's ridiculous , the only people complaining are people who do n't have children			0
not ' @entity10 ' enough ? this image shows the play equipment with the @entity9 estate behind it @entity22 says her children @entity23 and @entity24 are ' desperate ' to play in the boarded up playground children keep out ! the appealing - looking playground has high barriers around it to stop children playing there ' my husband and i bought our house specifically because it was going to overlook the park , but i 'm sick of staring at an iron fence			1
' @entity71 , 39 , who lives nearby , said she blames snobbery in the affluent area			0
she said : ' someone 's complained about it being too bright			0
i would understand it if it was some cheap metal play park , but it 's actually very nice			0
' i think it 's not seen as " @entity10 " enough			0
it 's a shame for the kids because they have waited a long time to play on it			0
' the @entity28 homes on the @entity9 estate , at @entity85 on the edge of @entity87 , @entity88 , were completed in august last year			1
families living on the estate say their children are ' miserable ' looking at the fenced - off play area the developer , @entity28 , says it is waiting for planning permission to repaint and move some of the equipment smart @entity88 estate : residents who have bought at @entity9 paid up to £ 500,000 for their houses many of the properties are finished in traditional @entity10 stone in keeping with the local landscape			1
@entity28 set aside half an acre for a play area , which would be built once construction was nearing completion on the rest of the site			1
the park contains slides , swings , rockers , monkey bars , a climbing frame and a cargo net			0
but before it could even open , some locals complained that it was too big , too bright and too visible to passing traffic on the main road			0
the developer agreed to repaint the equipment dark green and left the construction barriers in place - where they still remain today			1
@entity22 , who moved into a four - bedroomed £ 450,000 house with her husband @entity128 in december 2011 , said she would now rather have the park removed completely			0
she said : ' the people who are complaining about it do n't have children			0
' my kids have sat and looked at this for the best part of a year			0
' we need parks and spaces for children			0
at the end of the day it 's a park and we all bought homes knowing it would be built			0
' looks like fun : the playground at the residential estate has been fenced off since last summer the play area was built by developer @entity28 to go with the housing estate near @entity87 in affluent @entity88 @entity28 has now applied for planning permission to change the colour and move some of the play equipment			1
but @entity155 , technical director for @entity28 , denied that the area is bigger than permitted			2
he said : ' due to concerns raised by some residents over the new playground 's colour scheme at the opening has been delayed			2
' in response to the complaints , @entity28 has agreed with residents and @entity165 to adjust the colour of the equipment and move a few play items further away from dwellings			1
' @entity28 has submitted new plans to @entity165 which are expected to be approved by the end of next week			2
' once we receive approval the remedial work will commence and the play area opened without further delay			1
' still unused : families at the @entity9 estate are angry at those who have complained the play equipment is ' too bright ' @entity165 spokesman @entity180 said : ' @entity181 has responded to objections that were brought to us by some residents whose homes are near or overlook the play area			1
' at the request of several residents , it was agreed collectively that the opening of the play area would be put on hold until their concerns were considered further			1
' one of the residents ' concerns was about the bright colours of the equipment - which are not in line with the approved plan conditions for the play area			1
' the developer has agreed to address this as soon as the formal planning approval for relocating the equipment is granted			2
' playground designer and manufacturer @entity205 said the issue of people without children complaining about playgrounds was a common one			2
mr @entity205 , who is operations director of @entity212 in @entity213 , said bright colours helped children who were visually impaired navigate themselves around playgrounds			0
he said : ' @entity217 should be designed into play areas to promote integration of able and less able children			2
frankly , this playground is one of the less colourful options , being predominantly timber construction			0
' mr @entity205 said a similar playground would cost around £ 25,000 - £ 30,000 to build , and said it was ' not unusual to have residents who do n't have children complaining about children enjoying themselves '			2
he added : ' sometimes they even invoke the @entity231 saying that the children 's playground affects their right to peace and tranquility			0

the play area was built next to @entity9 estate in @entity88
still not opened because of complaints it was too big and *wrong* colour
