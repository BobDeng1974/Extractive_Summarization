by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 19:16 est , 15 january 2013 this is one family where they do n’t @entity2 – they call their mother			0
in what is best described as a labour of love , @entity7 has delivered six of her own grandchildren			1
she also acted as the birthing partner for the other two when they were born by caesarean section			0
family ties : from left , @entity18 , 2 , with mum @entity19 , 28 , @entity20 , 4 , @entity21 , 8 , @entity22 , 28 , holding son @entity23 , 4 , @entity24 , 10 , @entity25 , 5 , @entity7 , 49 , holding @entity27 , 4 mnths , @entity29 , 7 ( @entity31 's son ) , and @entity31 , 30 the 49 - year - old qualified as a nurse in 2002 and became a midwife two years later			1
a coincidence of timing ( plus a little gentle badgering of her bosses at the hospital where she works ) allowed her to take charge of the deliveries			0
it is probably fair to say opinion among those about to give birth is divided between women who would love their mother to be present , and those who could think of nothing worse			0
but yesterday @entity7 surrounded herself with her family and declared : ‘ the girls would have wanted me to be with them anyway , but this was much more special			1
‘ it ’s important that an expectant mother has trust in their midwife , and it ’s always easier if they have their mum with them too			2
