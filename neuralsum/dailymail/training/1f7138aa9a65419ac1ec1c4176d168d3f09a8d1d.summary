the idea that roll - ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong , the chief medical officer has warned the idea that roll - ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong , the chief medical officer warned last night			1
professor dame @entity8 warned that both forms of smoking effectively ‘ rot ’ the body from the inside			1
she said that contrary to popular belief that roll - ups are natural and less dangerous , the tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals			1
health officials are concerned that roll - ups are becoming increasingly popular amongst smokers who see them as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes			1
figures showed that 40 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women smokers use them , up from 18 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in 1990			0
but 49 per cent mistakenly believe they are less harmful , according to a survey of 627 individuals			2
the government is today launching a new stop - smoking campaign involving a shocking tv advert showing a father - of - two rolling a cigarette – which turns into rotting tissue			1
another depicts a smoker inhaling a cigarette and then contaminated black , blood spreading to his lungs , heart and brain			0
professor dame @entity8 said : ‘ while many smokers know the damage cigarettes do to their hearts and lungs , they are much less likely to be aware of how harmful smoking is to the body - essentially ‘ rotting ’ it from the inside out , and roll - ups are no exception			1
‘ january is a time when many people make @entity57 ’s resolutions to improve their health and try to stop smoking			2
‘ millions of people have used @entity61 support ( the @entity63 ’s stop smoking programme ) and we are hoping that this year , even more will take advantage of the free expertise and resources on offer			2
’ professor @entity69 , @entity70 for @entity71 , the government agency overseeing the campaign said : ‘ much of the harm caused by smoking does n’t become obvious until middle age but the invisible damage can start shockingly early - even by the late teens			1
contrary to popular belief roll - up tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals as normal cigarettes ‘ the earlier a smoker quits the better , but quitting at any age can help reverse at least some of the damage			1
that ’s why there is no time better than now to quit			0
‘ stop smoking and stop the rot			1
’ figures show that fewer in one in five @entity88 smoke , the lowest level in 80 years			0
health officials want to bring this down even further and they are concerned that rates are much higher in deprived areas			0
but @entity94 , which represents smokers , described the campaign as ‘ rotten ’ , ‘ poisonous ’ and an ‘ abuse of public money ’			2
@entity99 , the director said : ‘ there ca n't be a sane adult in the @entity88 who is n't well aware of the health risks of smoking			0
‘ what 's really poisonous is the way public health campaigners are constantly trying to scare and harass people with exaggerated claims and dubious statistics			0
‘ campaigns like this are an abuse of public money			0
education has been replaced by shrill scaremongering that is often counter-productive because it 's human nature to switch off when you 're being nagged or shouted at on an almost daily basis			0
‘ this is real life not a @entity120 film			0
