an unnamed disabled @entity1 woman is auctioning off her non-vital organs in a bid to keep financially afloat			0
she was interviewed on camera but kept her identity hidden ' i just need to do what i can for my daughter - her life is what 's most important			2
i do n't care about my own any more			0
' i started off trying to sell a kidney , but now i 'm not just selling that , i 'm also selling my corneas , one of my lungs and a piece of my liver			1
' i will sell whatever piece of my body that someone wants to buy and i am selling it out of desperation			1
' the @entity40 resident , who faces 12 years in jail for ' illegal organ trafficking ' if caught , said she only received 426 euros in dole money per month			1
the @entity1 woman can not afford rent despite being offered a low rate by @entity47 , pictured and because she is certified 66 per cent disabled due to a severe back problem , it means she is severely restricted in the type of jobs she can do			1
so , despite being offered a low rent by @entity47 which would come to just 400 euros per month , she can only really afford a fraction of that amount			1
she told the newspaper she had spoken to a woman doctor in @entity58 , one of the two @entity1 - owned cities on the north @entity62 coast , about selling her non-vital organs			2
it resulted in posting an advert online , but so far it has not produced a response			0
this is because , in reality , it is nearly impossible to sell organs , and is illegal in most countries			0
it has not been revealed on exactly which site the announcement has been placed			0
but the woman said her body parts are ' all she has ' and ' the only thing she can raise money from '			0
the newspaper reported that her 22 - year - old student daughter receives a small orphan 's pension after her natural father died some years ago			1
they both live in a house owned by the woman 's ex-boyfriend , from whom she separated after he regularly beat her up during their 15 - year relationship			1
she reported him on several occasions , but when the case went to court , a judge found the woman 's former partner not guilty			0
she said that , in the three years since they split up , things ' had gone from bad to worse ' and that he was now trying to evict her as she could not pay the rent			0
the @entity1 woman will go under the knife to help pay her rent ( file picture )			0
