published : 13:36 est , 9 december 2013 @entity1 : 14:38 est , 9 december 2013 it may not be one of life ’s great mysteries , but the lack of vast amounts of fossilised dinosaur faeces has baffled scientists for years			2
however , @entity11 researchers believe the answer lies in the diet of cockroaches , which might have dined on dinosaur waste millions of years ago			2
using cutting - edge imaging methods , the scientists discovered particles of wood inside an ancient cockroach ’s gut , which they think came from dinosaur faeces			1

a preserved cockroach caught in the act of relieving itself is pictured in figure a and its fossilised poo is pictured bottom right researchers from the @entity31 in @entity32 said that dinosaurs certainly must have produced a lot of faeces , and yet fossils of the waste are not very widely discovered			2
‘ although appearing trivial , cockroaches , one of the dominant insect orders during the @entity44 , were never examined as representing top candidates for partial processors of dinosaur dung , ’ they wrote in their study , published in the journal @entity40			0
ancient cockroaches from the extinct @entity51 family lived alongside herbivore dinosaurs between 250 million and 65 million years ago , @entity48 reported			1
the scientists used a technique called synchrotron x-ray microtomography to make a 3d model of a fossilised cockroach preserved in a chunk of 120 - million - year - old amber discovered in @entity60			0
ancient cockroaches from the extinct @entity51 family lived alongside herbivore dinosaurs between 250 million and 65 million years ago			1
a modern giant @entity63 hissing cockroach is pictured the cockroach in question died while it was going to the toilet , leaving behind a fossilised poo , called a coprolite that contains tiny pieces of wood			0
as the wood particles had smooth edges , the researchers said the cockroach did not chew them and its digestive system was not able to digest wood			1
the scientists therefore believe that the insect must have eaten the faeces of a herbivorous dinosaur			0
other fossilised species of the cockroaches have been discovered with undigested carbon in their guts , but it is only the specimen examined in the study that has been found to have indirectly eaten wood			0
there were theories that dung beetles and flies might have munched on dinosaur waste but they were rare during the @entity44 , the scientists said .			0

the researchers from @entity31 in @entity32 , said ancient cockroaches lived alongside herbivore dinosaurs up to 250 million years ago
using cutting - edge imaging methods , the scientists discovered particles of wood inside an ancient cockroach ’s gut
they think the insects ate dinosaur poo as the wood particles had smooth edges , indicating they were not chewed
