by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 14:24 est , 13 november 2012 while fears continue over the melting @entity4 ice caps climate change has actually increased the sea ice cover in the @entity6 , according to the first direct evidence from the region			1
scientists from @entity10 and @entity11 marked changes to @entity6 sea ice drift that have occurred over the last 20 years in response to changing winds			1
unlike the dramatic losses reported in the @entity4 at the opposite pole in the @entity6 sea ice cover has increased , according to maps created in @entity11 's @entity20 using over 5 million individual daily ice motion measurements captured over a period of 19 years by four @entity24 defense meteorological satellites			1
the study , published in @entity44 , shows for the first time how winds in the @entity6 cause the change in sea ice cover			1
lead author , dr @entity48 of @entity10 's @entity26 , said : ' until now these changes in ice drift were only speculated upon , using computer models of @entity6 winds			1
' this study of direct satellite observations shows the complexity of climate change			2
' the total @entity6 sea - ice cover is increasing slowly , but individual regions are actually experiencing much larger gains and losses that are almost offsetting each other overall			1
' we now know that these regional changes are caused by changes in the winds , which in turn affect the ice cover through changes in both ice drift and air temperature			1
' the changes in ice drift also suggest large changes in the ocean surrounding @entity39 , which is very sensitive to the cold and salty water produced by sea - ice growth			0
' sea ice is constantly on the move ; around @entity39 the ice is blown away from the continent by strong northward winds			1
since 1992 this ice drift has changed			0
' in some areas the export of ice away from @entity39 has doubled , while in others it has decreased significantly			0
' sea ice plays a key role in the global environment - reflecting heat from the sun and providing a habitat for marine life			1
september 26 , 2012 , when ice covered more of the @entity93 than at any other time in the satellite record			0
increase : at the end of the southern winter in september , ice covered 7.51million square miles of sea Â¿ more than at any time since records began in 1979			2
this image shows an icebreaker in the sea at both poles sea ice cover is at its minimum during late summer			1
however , during the winter freeze in @entity39 this ice cover expands to an area roughly twice the size of @entity113			2
ranging in thickness from less than a metre to several metres , the ice insulates the warm ocean from the frigid atmosphere above			0
the new research also helps explain why observed changes in the amount of sea - ice cover are so different in the two @entity123			1
the @entity4 has experienced dramatic ice losses in recent decades while the overall ice extent in the @entity6 has increased slightly			2
while @entity129 ice levels ( above ) are at record levels , @entity6 levels are rising due to wind , researchers said today however , this small @entity6 increase is actually the result of much larger regional increases and decreases , which are now shown to be caused by wind - driven changes			2
in places , increased northward winds have caused the sea - ice cover to expand outwards from @entity39			1
the @entity4 is surrounded by land , so changed winds can not cause @entity4 ice to expand in the same way			0
@entity11 's dr @entity143 said : ' the @entity6 sea ice cover interacts with the global climate system very differently than that of the @entity4 , and these results highlight the sensitivity of the @entity6 ice coverage to changes in the strength of the winds around the continent			1
' there has been contrasting climate change observed across the @entity6 in recent decades			2
the @entity156 has warmed as much as anywhere in the @entity158 , while @entity39 has shown little change or even a small cooling around the coast			0
the new research improves understanding of present and future climate change			0
it is important to distinguish between the @entity169 - glacial ice - which is losing volume , and @entity6 sea ice - frozen seawater - which is expanding , the researchers claim			1
researcher @entity173 is on the @entity174 ( right ) in the @entity6 conducting studies of the ice			2
he is with the @entity177 in @entity178			0
at well past midnight in @entity39 , where it 's about 3 degrees @entity180 ) , @entity173 describes in a rare ship - to - shore telephone call from the what this extra ice means in terms of climate change			0
and what it 's like to be out studying it for two months , with the nearest city 1,500 miles ( 2,415 kilometers ) away			0
' it 's only you and the penguins , ' he says			0
' it 's really a strikingly beautiful and stark landscape			0
' sometimes it 's even an eerie kind of landscape			0
' scientists on the cruise with @entity173 are spending eight to 12 hours a day on the ice			0
cracks in sea ice can form at any time , and a few days ago a sudden fissure stranded a team of scientists until an inflatable bridge rescued them			1
' it 's a treacherous landscape , ' @entity207 says .			0

the study shows for the first time how winds in the @entity6 cause the change in sea ice cover
researchers tracked changes over 19 years and analysed over 5 million measurements
