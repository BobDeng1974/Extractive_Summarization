@entity39 , chief executive of the @entity40 ’ @entity38 said : ' this is a farcical waste of taxpayers ’ money ... those who go out , get tanked up and then disrupt the peace should be dealt with by the police , not sent on a self - image course			1

' ' those who are alcohol dependent , who have mental health issues or are prolific offenders , will be excluded ... the individual will be bailed for 14 days and then given the option to attend a day long course , in which case the bail will be cancelled , ' it added			2
' if the option of the course is not taken up , then the person will be charged for the offence , ' the report went on			0
the course will be provided by @entity76 and will encourage people to reflect on their behaviour and self - image , rather than purely alcohol issues			1
