when @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 stomped down the @entity4 catwalk in @entity6 blanket coats - a new @entity8 style staple was born			1
the wool blanket ponchos , knitted in muted yellows , reds and blues , patterned with @entity13 - style zig zags were monogrammed with the initials of the model who wore it			2
designer @entity18 , known for setting trends , explained that @entity4 has a long history of capes and blankets and the @entity24 archive revealed that outerwear capes dated all the way back to the late 1880s			1
it 's the blanket brigade ! @entity0 leads the finale at @entity4 's @entity29 , which proved that the blanket will be the coolest way to wrap up warm this winter ' the designs were created for activities including shooting , motoring and cycling , and proved popular due to their warmth , protective qualities and ease of wear			1
' an illustration for a cotton gabardine cape also featured in @entity45 ’s patent application for the lightweight , weatherproof cloth in 1888 , ' he said			0
' the @entity24 archive presents advertisements for scarves as early as the 1880s in the local @entity51			0
' now , the iconic cashmere scarf , which lands in store on september 2 and can be personalised with initials , is at the heart of our brand , recognised globally and is one of our most popular products over the @entity8 period			2
' too hot to wear it ? no problem ! just throw it over your shoulder a la @entity4 's models who brought back the trend from the @entity24 archives , which have evidence of outerwear capes dating back to the late 1880s high - end versus high - street : @entity74 is lucky enough to have a monogrammed @entity4 version , left , but luckily for mere mortals , @entity76 have plenty for a fraction of the price , right and it was n't just @entity18 who sent blanket coats down the catwalk - @entity85 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 's models all wrapped up warm in theirs on the runway , too			1
the new poncho styles seemingly take inspiration from the traditional equestrian blanket , with blanket - stitched edging and a warm and hardwearing textured feel			0
@entity98 's catwalk edit describes them as the new ' wrap stars ' , with @entity100 advising : ' exquisite fabrics take this trend from sofa to street ; look for double - faced cashmere and silk blends for the perfect drape			1
' trendsetters : supermodel @entity109 , left , and @entity111 star @entity110 , right , love their blankets the high street is slowly but surely catching on and as the @entity8 collections drop in store , the likes of @entity116 , @entity76 , @entity117 and @entity118 are all offering their own cosy versions			1
@entity122 , fashion and beauty editor of the @entity124 , mused : ' when i saw @entity0 and co. storming the @entity8 catwalk , i had instant bespoke blanket envy			1
the monogramming , showcased by @entity130 ( @entity0 ) and @entity131 ( @entity1 ) , gives the piece massive trophy appeal			0
' if you ca n't afford the £ 895 @entity4 price tag , look to the high street for a blanket poncho homage			2
' @entity8 's ' blankoat ' blanket / coat fusion is surprisingly handy for transitioning between the seasons			1
' wear instead of an overcoat as a layering staple			0
if you 're wearing a blanket in @entity4 's proportions , keep the rest of your outfit streamlined to balance out your silhouette			2
' a step on from last winter 's shoulder robing , work it like a @entity4 model by draping your blankoat over one shoulder			2
if the asymmetry feels off make like @entity156 and wear around your neck , like a super-sized scarf			0
' any old blanket from the duvet cupboard just wo n’t do			0
your new season blankoat needs to be colour - blocked , textured and luxe - initials optional			0
' will you be wrapping up warm this winter ? @entity76 are offering cosy blankets for £ 35 , left , while designers are such as @entity165 , right , are jumping on the cosy bandwagon with this £ 250 plaid offering from @entity118			0
