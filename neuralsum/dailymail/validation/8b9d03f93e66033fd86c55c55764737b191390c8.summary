the day before @entity0 delivers his budget to the nation the @entity3 came up with its rough equivalent – the latest long term plan to revive the state of the game in @entity8			1
chief executive @entity9 finally unveiled his vision for the governing body , and in budgetary terms the big winner will be those people involved in marketing the sport and trying to get more people playing it			1
over the next four years there will be a 50 per cent uplift in money spent on marketing , so that by 2018 around £ 26 million will be spent on promoting the sport of tennis in the @entity24			1
while @entity26 established as one of the world 's best players , problems still exist at grass roots level other countries will look on enviously at such a huge sum although , given the current rankings of most @entity35 juniors , many may well comfort themselves that their stocks of elite players will be superior for years to come			2
@entity9 reaffirmed the @entity3 's laudable , broad policy of building the game from the bottom up by concentrating on participation and talked through a range of worthy and sensible measures to help achieve this			1
however , there was nothing especially original to stir the imagination or make an impact with the wider public , no ' @entity50 ' or some such thing			0
anyone wanting to see something more radical to improve the @entity24 game would be left disappointed			2
not that @entity9 , the former head of @entity55 who was appointed 18months ago , pulled all of his punches in presenting the latest of what have hitherto been doomed long - term plans for the @entity24 game			1
@entity3 chief executive @entity9 has unveiled his long term strategy to rejuvenate the game ' our sport is declining and some people have a problem hearing that , ' he said at the start			1
what he was specifically referring to was the problems tennis , like most other ball sports , has with declining participation numbers			1
they all face a challenge from what he termed ' doorstep ' sports , highly convenient and less technically demanding activities such as running , cycling , swimming and going to the gym , which can be done solo and whenever time permits			0
despite the hundreds of millions gleaned from @entity83 profits and that event 's ever growing popularity , there has been an average drop of 5 per cent in adult participation over each of the past five years			1
the particular problem is among the 16 - 44 age group with numbers steady above that			0
curiously he omitted to mention , until asked , that tennis is now played to a greater or lesser extent in 20,000 schools among 2.6 million children , an impressive figure that would be envied by most other sports			2
among the smorgasbord of measures to improve things , there will be a drive to increase participation in parks tennis			1
' i think the old @entity3 would have driven by the parks and straight into the clubs and schools , ' he said			1
the @entity3 receives millions annually from funds generated by the @entity83 there were other sensible ideas			1
with tennis participation peaking in july , there will be a concerted effort to get people to start playing earlier in the year			1
clubs , volunteers and coaches will get more support ( attempts at this are nothing new )			0
in junior tennis there will , wisely , be more emphasis on team events and there will be a much - needed concentration on creating a less pressured environment at junior tournaments			0
the emphasis will be on creating inclusive fun and recreational competitions across the board			0
@entity9 asserted that he was looking at the ' meat and potatoes ' issues , rather than eyecatching initiatives			2
he also pledged that the @entity3 would spend money ' like it 's your own ' ( no reference here to his own £ 434,000 pay package )			2
it is , clearly , expecting too much for any results to be instant , as with the efforts to improve the elite end of tennis			0
he was unrepentant about cuts to the performance side of the game and funding for lower ranked players , pointing out that the average entry age into the world 's top 100 is 21 for men and 20 for women			0
@entity160 's victory at @entity161 in 2013 spiked interest but there has been a five per cent fall in adult participation ' if you are 27 years old and still playing futures i do n't think you are going to be a top 50 player			1
it 's a ruthless business , ' he said , reiterating the ' no compromise ' message he wants to run through the elite end of the sport			0
while there has to be a degree of patience with his plans , they also illustrated the glacial pace of how things tend to be done at the governing body compared to what would happen in the more dynamic private sector			0
there are many things that have not even been considered or barely thought about			0
@entity160 , for instance , is nearly 28 and there is still no clue as to how to use his profile to spread the game			1
( @entity9 presented his ideas to him in @entity194 two weeks ago and was impressed by his interest			2
@entity9 has spoken to @entity160 after @entity8 's 3 - 2 @entity196 win over @entity197 in @entity194 tv advertising during the summer is not on the agenda			1
if there is an embracing of the excellent tennis for free charity and its proven methods then it seems limited			0
the whole key issue of playing surfaces did not raise a flicker , nor did the idea of adopting foreign training base with clay courts and a better climate			0
no participation targets have been set			0
the simple idea of trying to rebrand the organisation from its anachronistic ' @entity3 ' title to something more modern is apparently a non-starter for some reason			2
what was presented , though , was steady and sensible enough , while not especially imaginative nor wide in scope			0
like most budget speeches , the effects of its contents will not be immediately obvious .			0

there will be 50 per cent increase in marketing budget over next four years
