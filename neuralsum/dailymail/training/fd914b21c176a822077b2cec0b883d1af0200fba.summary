it is all about the wait			2
not for @entity2 with no major prizes to show for 110 years of trying but for @entity4 or , more specifically according to @entity5 , for their supporters			1
‘ trophies matter for your fans , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ it is a concrete sign that you win and that ’s what we want to do			2
your fans will be happy when you win trophies			2
’ the @entity4 manager gives the impression he has become weary of the wait			1
he is not impatient , but he finds the simplification tedious and gets annoyed that it can detract from his overall work in modernising a north @entity22 institution			0
losing the wait : @entity5 is ready to end @entity4 's nine - year trophy drought against @entity2 on saturday times gone by : @entity4 have n't had this sort of celebration for almost a decade the last time : @entity27 lifts the @entity28 in 2005 , the last trophy the @entity30 won it also , of course , provides a convenient stick to beat him with ; a stick @entity36 manager @entity35 finds hard to let go			1
‘ you win the next game or you lose it , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ if you win it , what do you think ? you think you dance for one week ? you think about preparing well for the next season and to win the first game of next season			0
that ’s what it is to be			0
‘ i will not be dancing on the beach in @entity48 , believe me			0
‘ it is the next game			0
i want to win the next game			0
it is an @entity28 final			1
i want to win the @entity28 final			1
’ he is tired of questions about the wait			2
‘ it has become a way to think for everybody , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ if you look at the overall consistency , nobody has finished in the @entity63 in @entity64 for 18 years			1
' it is true we are used to winning every year , basically			0
and , suddenly you do n’t win and it becomes a way of thinking			0
‘ you could go to some other clubs and ask : “ why did you not win the championship for 20 years ? ” nobody asks them the question			0
it ’s a non-creative way for everybody to organise press conferences			0
flat track bully ? @entity80 needs to show his quality on the big stage for @entity4 fans to end the season happy a new hope : @entity86 has been brilliant when fit this season , and can help lead @entity4 to glory ‘ three weeks ago , you asked me : “ what would you like ? to be in the @entity63 or win the @entity28 ? ” i told you both			1
we have done the first and now we can do the second one			0
’ @entity5 is still portrayed as a footballing romantic , committed to flair and crusading against the unfairness of ‘ financial doping ’			1
he also has a cold economic mind and a strategic definition of success			0
if it actually were a straight choice there is no way he , or owner @entity106 for that matter , would trade the £ 30million annual windfall of the @entity63 for the cheap hit of an @entity28 win			1
yet the shiny new trophy which will be awarded to the triumphant captain at @entity113 today has come to represent more than another @entity28 win ( it would be @entity4 ’s 11th and @entity5 ’s fifth )			1
it can also end the club ’s longest wait for a trophy since the 18 - year drought which preceded the @entity122			1
it can offer a tangible sign of progress			0
it can buy @entity5 time , restore support and lift the mood as he signs the new contract			1
the contract : a wait within a wait			2
the manager insists the delay is nothing to do with ending the wait , but still keeps the club waiting			1
if @entity2 win the @entity28 on saturday — the club ’s first trophy of note since the @entity141 title in 1966 — there is likely to be at best a mixed reaction at the @entity143 to the prospect of another two years of @entity5			1
@entity4 have lost a @entity63 final , a @entity148 final in calamitous fashion , and title challenges have flickered with promise and faded during the last nine years			1
an image has been formed , often encouraged by @entity5 , of an immature team lacking the courage and confidence to convert their talent into something more ‘ concrete ’			1
the @entity4 boss bristles at talk of a mental block ; especially on the eve of another showpiece they are expected to win			2
@entity5 ’s team have been brutally effective against most mid-and - lower table @entity166 teams this season			2
the extra quality of @entity80 , the development of @entity86 and a more solid defence , have certainly taken the team on from last season			0
they still have to prove they have what it takes to win something			0
in the @entity28 semi-final against @entity180 @entity4 were eight minutes from another @entity113 embarrassment before @entity182 saved the tie , took the game into extra-time and they won on penalties			1
‘ we were on a low point , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ there was more at stake than just going to the final			0
we were under threat in the @entity166 , as well			0
to have lost against @entity180 would have had consequences on our chances to finish in the top four			0
it would have created a huge disappointment			0
but we made it through			0
tough : when @entity4 fell behind to @entity180 it looked like their season was falling apart			2
survival : @entity204 's saves in the @entity28 semi-final were enough to see the @entity30 return to @entity113 ' we are favourites			2
unfortunately that does n’t guarantee you anything			0
’ @entity182 promised @entity4 will not ‘ collapse ’ and that the team were ready to take this step ; to end the wait and release the pressure which has built up over time and go on to greater things			1
@entity5 ’s @entity28 win in 2005 was not easy on the eye			1
it was win - at - all - costs against a rampant @entity220			0
the same could be said about today ’s game			0
can he end the wait ?			2

@entity4 manager *wenger* *dislikes* the simple nature of his trophy *critics* , but he too has grown weary of the wait
qualifying for the @entity63 was more *important* than @entity28
but @entity5 understands fans are *desperate* for *silverware*
