it should be a time of festive joy and cheer but for many people @entity3 can be a pretty lonely time of year ... especially if you 've just been dumped			1
because according to research the holiday season is one of the peak times that couples break up			1
second only to spring and just pipping @entity9 to the post			2
@entity11 spoke to relationship expert and break up coach @entity13 to find out not only why you might find yourself eating a @entity16 dinner for one this @entity3 , but how to get over it if you do			1
the holiday season is one of the peak times for break ups , second only to spring and just pipping @entity9 to the post @entity22 , new them @entity13 says : ' @entity3 and the @entity22 always signifies a time of change and new goals			1
it 's the most likely time of year that people want to think about self - improvement and life changes			2
this can also apply to relationships resulting in them ending with their @entity34 you 're the person left behind , you need to really think about whether you were having those same niggles too but perhaps brushing them to one side			0
was the relationship in a rut , were you just going with the motions ? and if not , if the two were n’t on the same page about where you want it to go , you 're probably not the best fit for each other			0
use the @entity22 as an opportunity for you to grow and make changes too			0
' they do n't want to meet your family ... ' @entity3 is a prime " meet the family " time , ' says @entity13 , ' it depends on how new the relationship is of course , but if you 've been together a while and the time is appropriate to meet the family yet they suddenly end the relationship , this suggests that they did n't want it to get this serious this soon - or not at all and so slammed on the breaks			1
' meeting the family can signify taking the relationship to the next stage			2
it 's likely that they just did n't want that			0
' if you find yourself dumped for this reason , although it hurts now , just keep in mind it 's for the best , as the two of you clearly had different visions about where the relationship was going			0
' it 's better that it ended sooner rather than later where you would have got even more invested in it			0
if your partner was concerned that it was moving too quick , they should have communicated this to you so that you could both discuss how or if to move forwards together			0
you 're better off being single ( even at @entity3 ! ) than in a relationship that is n't right for you			1
' ... but they also do n't want you to meet theirs @entity13 is a relationship expert and break up coach who helps people heal their heartbreak this family issue is n't one sided , claims @entity13 : ' the idea of introducing you to their family can also highlight to them just how serious the relationship is getting			1
it could force them to evaluate it and realise it is n't what they want			0
there might also be an element of them worrying about what their family think of you			2
' ' if you 've been finished with and you think this could be the reason , try hard to not get into the " i 'm not good enough " mindset			0
you are ! do n't you want to be with someone who ca n't wait to introduce you to their family ? you 're a catch and you want to be with someone who treats you as such ! ' if the reason is that they are worried about what their family will think of you , would n't you rather be with someone who has their own mind and stands up for who and what they want ? again , perhaps lack of communication about the relationship was missing			2
it looks like the two of you had very different visions , so you 're much better out of this now and can go into the new year with a fresh start			0
' they do n't want to buy you a gift @entity13 explains that whilst this may seem like a ridiculous reason to break up with someone , it can reveal bigger issues about the relationship			1
she says : ' it can force your partner to realise how little effort they want to spend on finding you the perfect gift and lead them to think about how much they really value the relationship			0
' or it can be as simple as the fact they ’re selfish ! if you are the one who has been dumped for this reason , you 're much better off being single than with someone who does n't value you enough			0
it 's not about expensive gifts ( or should n't be ) but more the thought that goes into them , and if they ca n't put the effort in , they 're not the right person for you			0
use the money or time you were going to spend on them on yourself this @entity3 instead ! ' the curse of the @entity3 affair although we might not like to admit it there is a chance that you might fail prey to a @entity3 affair			1
' the work @entity3 is prime one for cheeky kisses under the mistletoe … and sometimes more , ' @entity13 explained			1
' people can get carried away in the haze of the free champagne and go on to do something they may regret			0
' ' how to deal with this one if you find yourself being the victim of being cheated on ? well , @entity3 or not , cheating is cheating ! although it hurts now , you 've had a lucky escape as you do n't want to be with someone who after a few glasses of free booze will be tempted to stray ' @entity13 says that even if you do go through a break up this @entity3 it does n't mean you have have to give up all hope			1
here 's her top five tips for getting through the festive season on your own : 1			1

5.embrace the term ' single ' do n't stress and see it as a positive ! right now , you ca n't change the fact that you 're single but you can change the way you perceive it			0
you have complete freedom to do what you want , when you want so make the most of that ! now is the time that you have the ability to be completely selfish about doing what you want - for you , so embrace it ! if this is your first @entity3 being single and you 're finding it hard , do something or go somewhere during the holiday season out of the ordinary to mark a new start and create fresh memories .			1
