by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 06:15 est , 13 march 2014 @entity2 , 32 , an actress from @entity3 , was a child when a visceral dislike of the way she looks set in			1
following an accident that left her with a crooked nose , growing up , @entity2 loathed her looks so much , she could n't bear to look at photographs of herself and even confesses to slashing them with a knife			1
but after shelling out £ 7,500 for a nose job abroad , @entity2 was left worse off than ever before after her @entity14 surgeon botched the job so badly , she is barely able to breathe			1
problems : @entity2 says she has lost her smile because of the botched attempt at lip plumping a supplementary operation to plump up her lips also went wrong , and as a result , the devastated actress says she has lost her smile			1
' every time i saw a photograph of myself , i just hated it , ' she explains of her life before surgery			2
' i used to slash a knife through that photograph and say , " that 's not the way i came into this world ! " ' i thought it would be better going abroad because it 's cheaper and i thought you 'd get the same quality of surgery			0
' after paying £ 7,500 for her operation , flight and aftercare , @entity2 travelled to the @entity14 capital , @entity44 , for treatment and agreed to an additional procedure on her upper lip after hearing its benefits extolled by the surgeon			1
' he said " your lip , i could enhance the top layer so it matches the bottom lip which has all the volume in it " , ' remembers @entity2			2
horror : despite being assured things would improve , @entity2 was left with a permanently swollen upper lip before : @entity2 with the nose that she loathed before going under the knife in the @entity14 improvement : @entity2 has since had the strip of fat implanted into her upper lip removed ' so i thought " i 'll try that surgery "			1
' but the treatment , which involved grafting a strip of fat into the upper lip , was to have disastrous results			1
' i woke up after surgery and i did n't understand why my whole face was covered , ' she remembers			0
barely able to breathe through her nose and the owner of a pair of what @entity2 describes as ' pulsating lips ' , she frantically questioned the surgeon about whether this was normal and was told that everything would be fine in a couple of months ' time			1
' i waited patiently for several months , isolated myself waiting for the big change to happen , ' explains @entity2			2
' my smile was gone , ' she adds			0
' my nostrils were as wide as a pig 's nose			2
i thought , " what in @entity92 's name has happened to me ? " ' commenting on the case , @entity94 , a consultant cranio - facial surgeon based in @entity96 , says that experiences like @entity2 's are all too common			0
' laws abroad are very different to in the @entity100 , ' he explains			0
' it 's a sad fact that cosmetic surgery is not well regulated in this country , let alone abroad			0
' in a bid to fix the damage , @entity2 travelled back to @entity44 to confront the bungling surgeon and was offered a second cut - price operation - which once more had terrible results			0
now £ 9,000 in the red , @entity2 says she 's furious about what happened and claims the surgeon betrayed the trust she placed in him			1
' i do n't have my smile anymore , ' she adds			0
' i put my trust and faith in the clinic and they 've betrayed my trust			2
' thinking about the amount of time i have spent over the last few years running around in circles , getting injections , looking at my lip bleeding ... i just want to live a normal life again			0
' @entity2 appears on @entity126 , tonight at 10pm on @entity127			0

@entity2 , 32 , from @entity3 had always hated her crooked nose
but surgery left her barely able to breathe and with *enlarged* nostrils
upper lip surgery also went wrong and has left her unable to smile *properly*
says she is angry and claims the @entity14 clinic she used betrayed her trust
