by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor and @entity3 house speaker @entity4 said wednesday that he will file a lawsuit against president @entity6 for what he claimed is a series of abuses of power in the executive branch of the federal government			1
' this is not about impeachment , ' the @entity14 legislator insisted			0
' it 's about him faithfully executing the laws of this country			1
' @entity6 has touted his ' pen and phone ' approach to implementing his domestic agenda by going around @entity25 , casting 2014 during his most recent @entity26 as a ' year of action			1
' ' what we 've seen , clearly over the last five years , is an effort to erode the power of the legislative branch , ' @entity4 said			2
' i believe the president is not faithfully executing the laws of our country			1
his more controversial actions have included raising the minimum wage for companies undertaking new federal government contracts , ordering a long series of changes to the implementation schedule of his @entity61 law , decreeing new fuel - economy standards for trucks , and – most recently – declaring that the @entity65 will enforce a wide - ranging set of rules governing carbon emissions			1
@entity6 's @entity68 , formalized this week , is being called a ' coal - killer ' because it will dramatically increase costs associated with building and running coal - fired electric power plants			1
but most objectionable to conservatives in @entity4 's caucus , according to multiple @entity76 sources , is the president 's 2012 action that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity2 as children			1
that move , @entity42 say , led directly to the current border crisis that has seen tens of thousands of unaccompanied children – including many toddlers and infants – being brought across the @entity2 - @entity89 border in the hope of an amnesty			1
@entity44 press secretary @entity43 accused congressional @entity42 of obstruction on wednesday , and said they had left @entity6 with little option but to make greater use of his executive authority ' the fact that they are considering a taxpayer - funded lawsuit against the @entity100 for doing his job , i think , is the kind of step that most @entity2 would n't support , ' @entity43 said			1
' this lawsuit is not going to consume the attention of the @entity44			0
' @entity107 host @entity106 , an unlikely ally of the @entity6 administration , bemoaned the @entity42 's latest move as partisan politics on his show wednesday afternoon			1
' where was your rage when @entity115 were going after president @entity116 on the same use of executive orders ? ' @entity106 asked @entity120 rep. @entity119			0
' i think you know in your heart of hearts this is a waste of time now			0
there are far more important things you guys have to be addressing			0
' @entity119 apparently did n't get her caucus leader 's memo that the purpose of the lawsuit was not to impeach the president			2
' what we should do right now is defund the executive branch while we have the option , ' @entity119 said			0
' what we can do further is impeach the elected official			0
' ' think about what you are saying , ' @entity106 told her during the shouting match			0
' the @entity115 would be in their right mind to laugh you out			0
' executive action : the @entity42 says @entity6 's 2012 unilateral policy change on immigration enticed tens of thousands of unaccompanied children to cross the @entity2 border , putting a strain on government resources and creating a humanitarian emergency @entity4 said he has n't yet decided exactly which of @entity6 's executive actions he will challenge in court @entity4 told reporters on wednesday that he has n't yet decided which of @entity6 's executive actions he will challenge in federal court			1
' when i make that decision , i 'll let you know , ' he said			0
he told a closed - door @entity165 meeting on tuesday – and followed up with a detailed memo – that he plans to move ahead with the lawsuit in the coming weeks			0
the whole @entity52 would be the plaintiff , meaning he will need the approval of @entity52 leaders			2
with the @entity42 in the majority , that is n't expected to be a problem			0
the @entity174 , an informal @entity52 leadership panel , will likely make the call			2
it includes @entity4 , newly minted majority leader @entity176 and majority whip @entity177 , minority leader @entity178 and minority whip @entity179			0
a simple majority vote , likely 3 - 2 , will determine if @entity4 can proceed			2
asked in his weekly press briefing on wednesday if he 's committed to moving forward , he replied , ' i am			0
' the @entity52 has passed legislation that would curb the president 's power to take executive actions that @entity42 say fall outside his constitutional authority , but @entity189 majority leader @entity188 has declared them dead on arrival			1
@entity4 spokesman @entity191 told @entity192 on tuesday that @entity6 ' has a clear record of ignoring the @entity2 people ’s elected representatives and exceeding his constitutional authority , which has dangerous implications for both our system of government and our economy			1
' ' @entity52 has passed legislation to address this , ' said @entity191 , ' but it has gone nowhere in the @entity115 - controlled @entity189 , so we are examining other options			2

house speaker says @entity6 ' is not faithfully executing the laws of our country '
the president has taken at least 20 ' executive actions ' this year , including new *global* *warming* rules , a minimum wage hike and changes to the @entity61 law
conservatives in @entity25 are angry about @entity6 's 2012 change in immigration policy which they say led to a crush of unaccompanied children on @entity2 's *southern* border
a five - *person* panel of @entity52 leaders would have decide whether to sue the president , but the @entity42 controls three of those seats
@entity4 insists that the ploy ' is not about impeachment ' but that 's not how the lawsuit is playing
