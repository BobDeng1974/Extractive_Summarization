@entity0 has set @entity1 a target of 87 points to retain their @entity5 crown			1
the champions trail @entity7 by three points going into the trip to @entity10 but are on course to meet @entity0 ’s mark as they approach the halfway point of the season			1
twice in the past three years , @entity1 have won the title on the final day after finishing level with @entity18 on 89 points and edging out @entity20 with 86			1
@entity1 stars looked relaxed in training ahead of the @entity24 game at the @entity25 @entity1 's title charge appears to be building up a head of steam ahead of the crucial @entity30 period @entity0 has set @entity1 a target of retaining their @entity5 title @entity0 estimates that this year ’s winning total will be somewhere between the two			1
‘ you must win around 86 or 87 points , ’ he said			1
‘ you have to play for 57 points in the second half of the season and there are still six points in this half , so that ’s 63 points			2
with big teams it ’s always important to win titles but we are not thinking about what we did last season , or what happened with @entity7			2
‘ you must always forget whatever we did in the past and try to have your mind in the present because every season is different			1
’ @entity7 midfielder @entity56 has claimed the leaders are capable of winning a quadruple this season under @entity60 , but @entity0 speaks from experience when he says that such a feat would be very difficult			1
@entity1 won a @entity5 and @entity64 double last season , and were in contention for four trophies until march , when they went out of the @entity67 and @entity68 in the space of four days			1
@entity1 's @entity68 hopes were dashed by a @entity72 - inspired @entity71 in march but @entity0 added the @entity5 crown to the @entity64 to cap a memorable first season ‘ it ’s difficult , especially during december and january , ’ said the @entity1 boss			1
‘ they are two months when you have to play nine games each month , like we did last year			2
‘ you get towards the end of the season , march and april , but you must play semi-finals , finals of the cups			2
you must be on top of the table too , and you play fewer league games because of the cups			0
‘ we tried last year and we could n’t do it for different reasons			2
it ’s always possible — difficult but possible			0
’ @entity0 confirmed that @entity94 is expected to leave for the @entity95 with @entity96 after the @entity67 tie against @entity97 a week on sunday and could be unavailable until well into february			2
that has placed even greater importance on keeping @entity100 at the @entity101 , with the former @entity104 midfielder ’s future still unresolved			0
@entity100 ( left ) is becoming increasingly important to @entity1 - especially given @entity94 's absence city are confident that @entity100 ’s loan from their @entity110 sister club @entity106 will be extended until at least mid-february and possibly for the rest of the season			1
it is understood that the timing of the announcement is particularly sensitive , with @entity106 preparing for their debut season in @entity117 and @entity100 a central figure in their plans both on and off the pitch			0
‘ it ’s an internal reason that ’s not important , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the important thing is that @entity100 stays here			0
yes , i ’m confident he ’ll stay but i ca n’t say 100 per cent because it does n’t depend just on me			0
‘ it ’s not so easy because @entity100 is a @entity106 player			0
he ’s only on loan until december so we must respect the other people			0
‘ one of the reasons we asked @entity100 to play here was because we knew @entity94 would be leaving us to go to the @entity95			0
‘ @entity94 will go around january 5 - 10			0
we are not exactly sure of the dates but i think maybe the @entity67 game will be the last one			0
you always want to retain the best players here but you know the rules			0

@entity1 have twice won the title on the final day , with 86 points and 89 points , respectively
the citizens are on target to meet @entity0 's mark as they head to @entity146 with the halfway mark approaching
‘ you must always forget whatever we did in the past and try to have your mind in the present because every season is different , ’ said the @entity149
