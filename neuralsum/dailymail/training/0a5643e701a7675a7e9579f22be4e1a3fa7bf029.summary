children barely old enough to walk have been questioned by police over an astonishing range of crimes – including rape , theft , assault and vandalism			1
official crime statistics reveal how suspects as young as two years old were picked up by police officers			1
@entity11 also quizzed a four - year - old accused of rape in @entity14 , a five year - old for the same crime in @entity16 , a five - year - old on suspicion of incest in @entity19 and two three - year - olds for sexual offences in @entity22			1
the crimes apparently committed by children too young for primary school are among more than 5,000 offences by youngsters aged eight and younger			1
alarmingly , crimes reached a four - year high in 2014 , with 1,713 recorded			1
offences included fire - raising , possession of drugs , violence and causing racially or religiously aggravated public fear			2
this also comes in the wake of revelations that a total of 154 children aged 12 and under were arrested for sex crimes , including rape and sexual assault			1
at present , the age of criminal responsibility in @entity57 and @entity58 is 10 , which means there is nothing police can do			1
some campaigners want to raise the age of criminal responsibility from ten to 14 but if that proposal were implemented it would mean children such as @entity67 and @entity68 – who killed toddler @entity68 when they were ten – would not have to face court			1
@entity72 , 61 , who represented 10 - year - old @entity73 in 1993 , has now suggested the age of criminal responsibility be lowered to combat the rising rate of children crime			1
he told @entity76 : ' i think there is a growing case to lower the age of criminal responsibility as children crime is increasing			1
@entity72 , who represented @entity68 in 1993 , wants the age of criminal responsibility lowered ' teenagers recruit young children to commit crime for them as they know they can not be prosecuted			1
' the other problem is the rise of social networking means young children are more aware of what is going on in the world			2
' the age rate should be lowered			2
as a criminal lawyer , i sit in court and see what goes on in society			2
youths are much savvier than they have ever been			0
that is down to parental upbringing and because schools can not deal with children as they should			0
it is a problem that is getting worse			0
' as the age of criminal responsibility in @entity57 and @entity58 is set at 10 , there is nothing the police can do children under 10 can not be charged with committing a criminal offence			1
however , they can be given a @entity107 or a @entity108			0
children under 10 who break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care , or their parents could be held responsible			2
if a child is given a local child curfew it can last for up to 90 days and it can see children banned from being in a public place between 9pm and 6am , unless accompanied by an adult			0
if a child has committed an offence or broken a local @entity107 , they can be placed under the supervision of a youth offending team			0
this is called a @entity108			0
the order normally lasts for up to three months , but in some cases it can last for up to 12 months			0
if a child does n't stick to the rules of an order , the court can consider if the child should be taken into care			0
the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) has been warning since 1995 that the @entity35 's threshold of 10 – set in 1963 – is incompatible with its obligations under the @entity136 's convention on children 's rights			2
the @entity132 wants countries to set the age of criminal responsibility at an ' absolute minimum ' of 12 , and aim to keep increasing it			1
the @entity144 average is 14 , ranging from 13 in @entity145 , 14 in @entity146 , 15 in @entity147 and @entity148 , 16 in @entity149 and 18 in @entity150			0
@entity151 increased the age at which children can be prosecuted from eight to 12 in 2011			2
children between 10 and 17 in @entity57 can be arrested and taken to court if they commit a crime			2
they are treated differently from adults and are dealt with by youth courts , given different sentences and sent to special secure centres for young people , not adult prisons			0
of the total 5,665 recorded crimes , the vast majority were criminal damage or vandalism with 2,376 , followed by shoplifting , theft and dishonesty with 1,279 and assault or acts of violence with 985			1
there were 35 rapes , of which 24 were in @entity14			0
disturbingly , more than half of the rapes took place in the last year with campaigners citing ' degrading and often violent pornography ' as a factor for this concerning rise			0
@entity181 , @entity183 lead for tacking sexual abuse , said ; ' it is very worrying that thousands of children are committing crimes , and even more concerning that many of these are sexual offences including serious assaults and rape			1
' prevention has to be the key and that means recognising warning signs early and taking swift action			0
' sadly , for many children easy access to degrading and often violent pornography is now part of life , and we are concerned that this may be warping their view of what is normal or acceptable behaviour			0
' when very young children , such as those of primary school age or younger , are committing these crimes , we have to question the environment in which they are growing up that has led to them behaving in this way			1
' it could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they 've seen			0
' @entity225 , from the mothers against murder and aggression charity , said : ' it is a concern that these figures are rising			0
we must do more to identify children of such a young age who display violence			2
' interventions that are effective at changing that behaviour at the earliest possible stage need to be resourced and applied			0
' crime victims who are affected by serious crimes committed by the under 10 's are often left devastated by the fact that they will not be part of the @entity240 and are often left with no knowledge of how the offender is being managed following serious crimes			1
' questioned on whether the age of criminal responsibility should be lowered , a @entity245 spokesman said : ' the government has no plans to lower the age of criminal responsibility , which in @entity57 and @entity58 is currently set at the age of 10 , because we believe that children under that age are unable to weigh up right and wrong in the same way that older children or adults are			1
