@entity2 is a distributed peer - to - peer digital currency that functions without any central authority , such as the @entity70			1
the currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers			2
@entity2 can be bought with near anonymity , which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy			2
but critics say that also makes @entity2 a magnet for drug transactions , money - laundering and other illegal activities			2
