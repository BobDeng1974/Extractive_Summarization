by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 2 february 2013 a team of @entity4 carpenters have built a copy of the @entity8 's @entity7 ship from the @entity10 movies and yarrgh , she really blows			1
the questionable replica , which is being nailed together near the city of @entity13 on the banks of the @entity15 , is the brainchild of local carpenter and film fan @entity18			1
it could be because they have run short of doubloons or perhaps it 's the freezing @entity4 winter but , as yet , their rickety - looking creation bears little resemblance to the movie ship			0
shiver me timbers : the disastrous copy of the @entity7 ship from the @entity32 films being built in @entity4 real thing : the impressive @entity7 galleon which featured in all of the @entity32 movies in the hit @entity37 films starring @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , the @entity7 is depicted as an impressive galleon with a jet black hull and sails to match			2
star : @entity38 as @entity8 in @entity32 : at @entity44 loaded to the gundecks with cannon and crewed by the most fearsome pirates to be found anywhere on the @entity50 , it is said to be the fastest ship on the seas			0
the @entity4 version however appears rather less of a ship than a floating shed , with ugly square sides at the front , gaping holes in the hull and more than few rough edges			0
the masts look like three spindly grey polls , there 's not a single cannon to be seen and even the figurehead at the prow could do with a spruce up			0
to their credit , the carpenters appear to be using little more than hand - tools for the build and there is some way to go before completion so they could surprise us yet			1
scourge of the seas : the floating eyesore nears completion on the banks of the @entity15 @entity80 : one of the @entity4 carpenters uses an axe as he works on a wooden beam for the replica ship @entity85 : an inside view of the @entity4 ' @entity7 copy @entity88 : the vessel 's figurehead looks out across the @entity15			2

replica of the @entity7 being built on the banks of the @entity15
it is the brainchild of local carpenter and film fan @entity18
the team appear to be using little more than hand - tools for the build
but there is much work left to do so they could still surprise us yet
