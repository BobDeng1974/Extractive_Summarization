by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:48 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:32 est , 18 december 2013 more than 40 per cent of @entity3 is to be opened up for fracking as the hunt for shale gas gathers pace			1
a new map reveals the huge swathes of the country where energy firms will be invited to drill			0
stretching from @entity11 to @entity12 , the map , published yesterday by the government , shows the extent of the new areas under consideration for exploratory work			0
these include much of the @entity20 , the @entity21 and most of @entity22			1
fracking has already proved to be hugely controversial , sparking protests in @entity25 in @entity26 when exploratory drilling began this summer			1
@entity29 groups opposed to the technology said the announcement ‘ cast a dark shadow ’ over the communities where fracking could take place			1
but energy minister @entity36 said the energy reserves had the potential to transform @entity3 ’s economy			1
a new licensing round will start next summer , with companies expected to be granted up to 150 exploratory licences			1
the new map reveals 39,000 square miles of land to be considered for exploration , covering 42 per cent of the country			2
at the moment companies have licences to drill in 7,300 square miles , mostly in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
mr @entity36 said : ‘ today marks the next step in unlocking the potential of shale gas in our energy mix. it is an exciting prospect , which could bring growth , jobs and energy security			0
’ protests : fracking has already proved to be controversial , sparking protests in @entity25 in @entity26 an independent environmental assessment of the new industry , also published yesterday , said fracking could create up to 32,000 jobs and plough £ 1billion into communities where drilling takes place			1
but it found that each well would create a significant local impact			0
each fracking site could see as many as 51 lorry movements a day for up to three years , said private firm @entity75 , which produced the report for the government			2
that ’s the equivalent of one lorry weighing at least three and a half tons , every five minutes of the working day for nearly three years			0
the report says that this level of activity ‘ could have an adverse impact on traffic congestion , noise or air quality ’ depending on existing conditions			0
the report also found that new technology would require 9million cubic metres of water a year , increasing industrial water use by 18 per cent			2
up to 2,880 wells would be drilled , the report estimates , producing up to 8.6trillion cubic feet of gas over 20 years – enough to meet @entity3 demand for three years			1
communities where planning permission is granted will get a £ 100,000 one - off fee and 1 per cent of revenues throughout the lifetime of the wells , divided between parish and county councils			2
support : designer @entity103 gave her support to the protestors at the fracking site this summer mr @entity36 , a conservative , pledged that local councils would have the final say as to whether drilling goes ahead			1
and the government expects that up to 7,700 square miles , only a fifth of the land under consideration , may be explored for fracking			2
but he claimed shale gas could significantly reduce household bills			0
@entity29 groups say fracking will devastate local environments and prolong reliance on fossil fuels			0
@entity124 energy campaigner @entity125 said : ‘ these plans cast a dark shadow over many communities across @entity3 who could now face the threat of fracking in their backyard			1
@entity134 energy campaigner @entity133 said : ‘ @entity36 is desperate to put a positive spin on this report , but what it actually shows is that the government wants to open two - thirds of @entity141 up to fracking , with all the associated risks			0
’ @entity144 , @entity145 for south - east @entity141 , said : ‘ the government is ramping up their pro-fracking rhetoric ahead of issuing the next round of licences but campaigners and concerned residents wo n’t be tricked into believing the hype			0

@entity20 , the @entity21 and most of @entity22 earmarked
more than 40 per cent of @entity3 will be opened up for fracking
drilling in @entity25 , @entity26 , sparked protests this summer
