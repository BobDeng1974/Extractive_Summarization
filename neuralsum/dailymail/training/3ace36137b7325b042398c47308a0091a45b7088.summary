@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , who 's always outside – these are just a handful of @entity19 ' 30 - odd dogs			1
the @entity21 - born migrant who moved to the remote @entity23 community of @entity24 in @entity25 10 years ago , is one of the 85 women that feature in photographer @entity29 's new book , @entity30			1
the 42 - year - old photographer from the @entity32 , west of @entity33 , whose favourite sight is the face of dog hanging out of a car window , told @entity38 that he spent half a year travelling around the country to document the stories and happy moments between women and their dogs for his new book			1
amongst them is @entity68 , from @entity69 , who adopted her dog @entity72 after finding him abandoned and stranded in the flood waters following @entity75 in the @entity76			1
' he was using this car as like an island , but because of the heat at the time , all his feet had become blistered from the roof and @entity68 found him over there and brought him all the way back to @entity25 , ' mr @entity29 said			1
meanwhile @entity86 , who lives in @entity87 with her beagle , @entity89 , spent over $ 50,000 to save her dog 's life from numerous health conditions including lymphoma and epilepsy			1
she ’s one of the 85 women and their dogs , from all walks of life , whose stories feature in photographer @entity29 's new book , a girl 's @entity30 @entity68 , from @entity69 , adopted @entity102 after finding him abandoned and stranded on the roof of a car with blistered feet amongst the flood waters of @entity75 , bringing him back with her from the @entity76 but it 's @entity19 , with her @entity108 over-flowing with canines , that has dedicated her whole life to saving the seven hundred or so stray dogs in her local community			1
she has dedicated her time to implementing health programs and educating locals on how best to deal with the strays , while maintaining respect for the animals			1
' ten years ago i arrived here in @entity24 to work as the assistant art manager , and i discovered that the dogs in the community were in really bad condition			1
there was no vet coming here , no animal welfare people , ' @entity19 told @entity127			2
' most people in the community did n't realise that if you had a sick dog , you could do something about it — like if you take medication for yourself you 're going to get better			0
if you do it for the dogs , they are going to get better also			0
' @entity86 , who lives in @entity87 with her @entity89 , spent over $ 50,000 to save her dog 's life from numerous health conditions including lymphoma and epilepsy @entity142 adopted @entity143 when she was still a veterinary student			1
' @entity143 's been diagnosed with a terminal illness that @entity142 ca n't fix ; she 's learnt all the skills in the world but she ca n’t save this dog from her heart condition , ' mr @entity29 said @entity19 began by feeding the dogs with her own money and eventually , after holding talks with the local council , managed to arrange for a vet to come out to the remote town to help manage simple health problems like ticks , start a temporary sterilisation solution and offer the option of euthanasia			1
' many of the dogs were unwanted , but it was very difficult for the people to say that because the police would come round and shoot the unwanted dogs , ' @entity19 said			2
' the locals did n't want to see the dogs shot , so the vet showed them how she could put them to sleep in a very comfortable manner , without any screaming , fighting or bloodshed			0
@entity173 and her greyhound @entity172 on @entity176 ’s @entity175 – @entity172 saved @entity173 from an intruder entering her home @entity179 is the president of the @entity180 in @entity181			0
she credits her beautiful @entity182 ( right ) as the instigation for getting involved in the shelter in the first place ' when the community saw this option they surrendered 174 dogs for euthanasia			0
it was very sad , but it was also amazing because these people were being educated and were able to manage an animal health problem for the first time			0
' @entity19 was also responsible for the adoption of over 250 dogs that were sent out to various new homes across the country through the @entity200 program			2
' when i arrived here , people told me that these @entity204 do n't care about the dogs			0
that was bulls * * * ! ' @entity19 said			0
she recalled unforgettable moments of compassion from the locals , including one family who waited until their dog was under anaesthetic and unable to hear them during its sterilisation , before admitting they did n't want to keep him			0
three - legged @entity219 , the jack russell cross fox terrier , was lucky enough to find a home with former athlete @entity222 after having his leg amputated following an accident with a bike @entity226 met @entity227 after moving from @entity33 ’s northern beaches to @entity69 , where she turned her life around by beginning work on a camel farm and forming a relationship with a camel stockman ' that showed me that they really did respect the dogs , because they did n't want the dog to know it was n't wanted , ' @entity19 said			1
she also remembered an @entity23 family that had dug a specific grave for their dog , which had passed away , so that his head would be pointing towards his home , and held hands to pray following his burial			2
but it 's her own dog family that makes @entity19 love her life			2
' over the ten years i 've been here , i 've probably had more than 1000 dogs living here			2
at the moment i have 32 dogs			0
they are all different and they all have their quirky behaviours			0
' @entity29 and his own loved pets : a girl 's @entity254 is the photographer ’s fifth book entirely dedicated to dogs ' people always ask if i have a favourite , but i love them all			1
some people might look at me and think i 'm crazy , because the situation might look overwhelming … , but the other day i was thinking just how lucky i am to have all these dogs			0
i really love my life			0
' one of the most memorable characters mr @entity29 met on his travels , was @entity142 and her dog @entity143			2
the duo met while @entity142 was a vet student , practising operations on dogs that had to be euthanised			0
but the bond between @entity142 and @entity143 became too strong , and the student felt compelled to save her life and adopt her			0
years later , with the growth of her own veterinary business , @entity142 is coming to terms with letting @entity143 go			0
' she 's been diagnosed with a terminal illness that @entity142 ca n't fix ; she 's learnt all the skills in the world , but she ca n't save this dog from her heart condition , ' mr @entity29 said of the heart - wrenching duo			1
' for me it 's about those little moments – i see a lot of photos of dogs that are staged , but if you are a dog lover , you know and understand them and that little moment of interaction , when the dog is doing something beautiful and you get joy from it , that gives me a great happiness			2

amongst them @entity21 - born migrant @entity19 , who has saved the lives of hundreds of stray canines in the @entity23 community of @entity24 in @entity25
