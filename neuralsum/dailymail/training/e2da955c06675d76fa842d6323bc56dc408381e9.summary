by @entity0 @entity1 names his five @entity3 penalty - takers for a potential @entity5 shoot - out with the same authority as he once despatched his own spot - kicks			1
‘ no 1 , @entity15 , ’ says the @entity9 legend , whose record of 47 successful penalties from 48 attempts qualify him as an expert			1
‘ it ’s not @entity9 bias			0
his penalty record is awesome — impeccable			0
‘ @entity19 at @entity20 , good technique			0
@entity22 and @entity23 , three and four			1
on the spot : @entity15 has never missed a penalty during his time at @entity9 expert : former @entity9 star @entity1 , pictured here celebrating scoring a penalty against @entity29 , only missed one of 49 penalties in his career ‘ @entity22 has scored a lot of penalties this season , so he ’ll be confident			1
i know @entity23 has missed a few , but he ’s experienced and the sort of lad who would want to stand up and put himself in that position			2
’ but the records show that @entity40 has never taken a penalty for @entity9 mainly due to @entity15 ’s perfect record			1
‘ i ’ve never seen @entity40 take a penalty , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ but with his ability and attitude , i ’d be pretty confident			0
’ @entity15 faces a fight to even get into @entity49 ’s squad when it is announced on monday , with @entity50 and @entity51 also being backed to be @entity3 ’s fourth striker			2
while his penalty record will not be the decisive factor , it surely gives him an advantage with @entity3 having crashed out of six of the last 10 tournaments in shoot - outs			2
deadly : @entity60 's @entity19 , pictured here scoring a spot - kick against @entity62 , is a candidate to take @entity3 's penalties in @entity64 mixed record : @entity66 's @entity23 ( left ) has missed a number of penalties in recent years it might have been different had @entity1 played in the @entity71 semi-finals or 1998 @entity5 tie against @entity73 , but he only won eight caps and none in a @entity5 or @entity76			1
@entity3 ’s misses have come in all shapes and sizes			0
remember @entity81 ’s spacebound blast at @entity82 or @entity84 ’s weak effort versus @entity73 at the @entity85 ? @entity86 skied the first spot - kick against @entity88 at @entity89			0
@entity90 came up with a new one at the 2006 @entity5 against @entity88 , smashing the ball in before the referee signalled he could take it			0
he missed his ‘ real ’ attempt			0
over the bar : @entity86 missed a key penalty against @entity88 at @entity89 as @entity3 crashed out			2

@entity1 *believes* @entity15 should take @entity3 's first penalty if they face a shootout at the @entity5 in @entity64
@entity19 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity40 also make @entity1 's list
the former @entity9 *man* only missed one penalty from 49 attempts in his career
