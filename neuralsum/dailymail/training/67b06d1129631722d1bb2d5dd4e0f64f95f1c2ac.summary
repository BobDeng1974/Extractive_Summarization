when the @entity6 particle was discovered , the fact that @entity1 had decided to use the @entity3 font to make the announcement threatened to overshadow the whole historic occasion			2
the same things nearly happened today following the landing on @entity11 by @entity13 's @entity12 - with @entity13 lead @entity15 becoming an internet sensation as viewers grew captivated by his red - tinged mohawk haircut , the the yellow stars dyed above his ears , and his big beaming smile following a successful day			1
