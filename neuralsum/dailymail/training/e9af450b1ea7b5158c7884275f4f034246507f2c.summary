@entity2 's second highest shareholder @entity0 believes the @entity4 club are ' well placed ' to enjoy a trophy - laden future			1
in a rare interview , @entity0 reckons @entity2 , who have taken their tally of spending to over Â£ 50million with the arrivals of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 this summer , are ready to claim their first @entity15 title since 2004			1
' the club is very well placed to succeed , ' he told the @entity16			0
' i think we begin a new era for @entity2 where we win trophies			0
in my opinion , in line with the existing rules , the club has the correct decision - making process in place , including their selection policy , especially now , when they have the means to buy the best players			2
' @entity2 ended their nine - year trophyless run after they lifted the @entity40 in may , but @entity0 believes @entity21 's side could have tasted success earlier if they 'd adopted a different strategy when they moved from @entity44 to the @entity45 in 2006			1
@entity46 and @entity47 were among the main high - casualty departures as the @entity49 looked to balance the books			2
splash the cash : @entity21 has eventually loosened the sizeable purse string at the @entity45 on his way out : @entity46 was sold to @entity54 but @entity2 appear to have changed policy now @entity56 expecting great season ' the board and main shareholders chose the debt option at the time , which led to @entity2 going almost 10 years without winning a domestic title or the @entity63 , ' he said			1
' the first trophy only arrived in the 10th year			0
as a result of this choice , they were selling players and were unable to buy top players			0
' these difficulties have now been overcome and the team is in a good state ; the club 's finances are in order and i believe that @entity21 and the club 's ceo [ @entity77 ] will manage them correctly			2
' @entity0 insists he has never spoken to the club 's majority shareholder @entity81 - known as ' @entity82 ' and says he will remain with the @entity49			1
' i have no plans to exit			0
i wish @entity2 success and hope that they win trophies			0
