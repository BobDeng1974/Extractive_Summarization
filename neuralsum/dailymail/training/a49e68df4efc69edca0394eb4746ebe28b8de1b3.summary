@entity0 branded the @entity1 as ‘ hypocrites ’ yesterday over @entity4 ’s demands that @entity5 abandon its £ 1billion warship sale to @entity7			1
the prime minister says it would be ‘ unthinkable ’ for @entity0 president @entity10 to go ahead with the supply of two helicopter carriers to @entity13			1
@entity15 leaders have been under intense pressure to impose tough sanctions on @entity7 – or risk repeating the mistakes of @entity20 appeasers in the 1930s			2
but mr @entity10 has vowed to press on with the deal , with an ally warning mr @entity4 that he should ‘ start by cleaning up his own back yard ’			0
‘ but we need to put the pressure on with all our partners to say that we can not go on doing business as usual with a country when it is behaving in this way			0
’ in response , @entity52 , head of @entity10 ’s ruling @entity53 , said : ‘ @entity10 is not backing down			0
he is delivering the first ( ship ) despite the fact he is being asked not to			0
‘ this is a false debate led by hypocrites			0
when you see how many ( @entity7 ) oligarchs have sought refuge in @entity62 , @entity4 should start by cleaning up his own back yard			1
’ tougher sanctions have been proposed in an attempt to force mr @entity30 to rein in the separatists in eastern @entity34			1
after an emergency summit in @entity68 , mr @entity4 hailed an agreement in principle to widen measures against mr @entity30 ’s ‘ cronies ’ and to consider targeting @entity7 ’s defence sector			1
but @entity75 ’s president reflected growing anger in former @entity78 countries at the failure of @entity81 leaders to move decisively following the downing of flight mh17			2
‘ if @entity15 states keep on acting so indecisively , this is a direct invitation for the aggressor to be more aggressive and go further , ’ said @entity84 , condemning @entity0 for pressing ahead with the @entity86 sale			0
new @entity1 foreign secretary @entity90 ( right ) speaks to @entity92 foreign minister @entity91 at a @entity94 meeting at the @entity96 headquarters in @entity68 @entity7 president @entity30 last year teased @entity4 about the influx of wealthy foreigners into @entity62			1
@entity1 was dismissed as ' a small island ’ by his spokesman , who claimed nobody pays attention to it – except of course the @entity7 ‘ oligarchs who have bought @entity107 ’			0
that does not mean that every wealthy @entity7 in @entity62 now faces the prospect of sanctions			1
but it does raise questions about the @entity1 government 's willingness to accept their millions into the @entity116 's coffers			0
‘ in the 1930s , @entity117 was n’t stopped , and now aggressive @entity7 chauvinism is n’t stopped and that resulted in the attack against a civilian plane			2
’ yesterday , the @entity81 threatened @entity13 with broad economic sanctions if it failed to muzzle @entity125 separatists fomenting chaos in @entity34 – but stopped short of any immediate action to punish the @entity128			2
@entity90 , @entity1 ’s new foreign secretary , had called for an immediate arms embargo , while @entity1 and @entity131 also brandished lists of names of @entity135 individuals and firms they want targeted			2
@entity81 foreign ministers agreed to draft a new set of names by tomorrow to be added to the 63 individuals and entities already targeted			1
the latest move could mean a big increase in asset freezes and travel bans			0
@entity81 leaders also agreed to prepare further options , including a potential arms embargo and broader sanctions against @entity7 ’s energy and financial sectors			1
many of @entity7 ’s billionaire businessmen are said to be ‘ horrified ’ at the prospect of crippling economic sanctions but are too terrified of mr @entity30 to say so openly			2
there was a suggestion last night that the threat of sanctions is already having an impact on @entity7 oligarchs			1
asked if there was any evidence of assets being moved out of @entity62 , the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ the measures which have been taken with regard to individuals and entities has got a correlation with some of the financial flows we have seen across @entity174 , including here in @entity62			1
' that ’s certainly the case			0
’ of the @entity68 talks , mr @entity4 said : ‘ we are making progress			1
' other countries of @entity174 can now see that this lethal cocktail of allowing weapons and armed personnel to go into eastern @entity34 and support separatists has ended in this appalling tragedy			0
’ mr @entity30 last night declared that @entity7 would strengthen its military capability to ‘ counter @entity189 activity ’ in @entity174 .			0

prime minister *insists* all @entity81 countries must accept impact of sanctions
