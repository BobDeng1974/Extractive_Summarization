hot spots : @entity1 in the @entity3 dress which sold out online in an hour it is possibly the most well - known colour code of them all – pink for a girl , blue for a boy			1
so when the @entity11 revealed she had bought a pram in light blue , @entity10 watchers wondered excitedly if she had dropped the biggest clue yet to the sex of her unborn child			1
@entity11 – who is six months pregnant – told guests at a recent reception that she had chosen a buggy by designer label @entity20 , which has celebrity fans including actress @entity23 and television presenter @entity24			1
the buggies , which cost from £ 500 to £ 1,000 and can operate as either a pushchair or pram , come in a variety of colours and parents who do not know the sex of their baby usually prefer neutral hues such as beige , off - white or black			1
the @entity36 and @entity11 have insisted that they do not know if they are having a boy or a girl			2
but although it is possible to swap some of the buggy ’s accessories for those in different colours , including pink , @entity11 ’s choice of blue will be seen as a clear hint as to her feelings about the gender			1
she has said she would prefer a son while @entity51 wants a daughter			1
yesterday , @entity20 said it had not presented the buggy to the royal couple after being advised by officials not to send gifts			1
so it appears that @entity11 , who was seen shopping for a @entity60 basket in @entity61 last week with her mother , bought the pram herself			2
@entity1 , 31 , revealed the @entity20 colour when she chatted to a group of @entity67 wives at a drinks reception in @entity69 on @entity70			2
according to one source : ‘ she and some of the other girls were talking about prams and one of the girls had her baby in a @entity20			2
royal transport : a blue @entity20 buggy fit for a prince ? the @entity11 - effect : the @entity1 ' choice of dresses often create sell - outs and her baby purchases could do the same her choices of dress have long spawned a rush to the shops – and this pretty polka dot outfit proved pregnancy has done nothing to dent the ‘ @entity91 ’			1
just an hour after the @entity11 arrived at the @entity95 film studios in @entity96 on friday , the @entity3 dress , which costs just £ 20 in the sale , had sold out online			0
now it has emerged the skater dress was bought personally by the @entity11 from @entity3 in @entity99 last month			0
it is understood she arrived unannounced and spent nearly an hour browsing with her security staff , looking at the main range rather than maternity clothes			0
' @entity11 said she has bought one in light blue			1
it was a bit of a hint			0
’ @entity109 , 29 , who met @entity11 at the ceremony , said the @entity11 was happily discussing the @entity10 bump			0
he said : ‘ i asked her , “ do you know if it ’s a girl or a boy ? ” and she said , “ not yet ”			0
she said , “ i ’d like to have a boy and @entity51 would like a girl			0
” i asked her if she had any names and she said no. ’ since then , however , the royal couple have revealed they have a shortlist of boys ’ and girls ’ names			0
@entity126 and @entity127 are said to be favourites for a girl , with @entity130 in the running for a boy			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity1 declined to comment .			0
