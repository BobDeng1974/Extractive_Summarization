to live in @entity0 is to experience the devastating fury of bushfires , meaning nearly every single @entity0 is affected by the firefighters who fight to keep us safe			1
an @entity6 documentary airing this week gives a glimpse into the incredible life of a firefighter - including heart pumping @entity12 footage from the helmet of a @entity15 volunteer , running through smoke with flames licking at his heels			1
@entity0 has the largest firefighting force in the world with a volunteer army of over 200,000 - double that of the military			1
more than a million @entity0 have built homes in fire zone areas			1
2013 was the hottest year on record and on the verge of another sweltering summer , firefighters will be on call to save not only @entity0 homes , but also our lives			1
astonishingly the men and women that put their lives on the line for our are largely unpaid volunteers			0
they do n’t realise that they do it for free , ’ @entity58 , a volunteer firefighter of more than 20 years			1
‘ there is such a huge mix of people that volunteer with the fire service			1
the value of the volunteers can not be measured			0
' ‘ we ’re very fortunate to the time and effort given by thousands of volunteers			0
their time would be worth billions of dollars if they were to be paid			0
’ in the footage , the firefighter is forced to seek refuge in the firetruck , when the flames encroach upon him many people are unaware that most firefighters are unpaid and are also ' lawyers , butchers , doctors , chefs – even the prime minister is a volunteer with the rural service ' people are unaware that underneath the fireman ’s suit , there very well could be another uniform from the volunteer ’s day job			1
‘ sometimes it ’s a surprise for people to find out that the firefighter may well be a lawyer , butcher , doctor , chef – even our prime minister is a volunteer with the rural service			1
’ @entity15 inspector @entity58 was a volunteer for 20 years before he joined the service in a paid media role			1
‘ i have been very lucky to turn a hobby in a career			0
i absolutely love working here			0
you ’re working with people that want to work here so much that they come for free			2
’ mr @entity58 says that after every major fire , they are inundated by people wanting to volunteer , which makes it such an enjoyable place to work mr @entity58 says that after every major fire , they are inundated by people throwing their hands up to volunteer , which illustrates the spirit of the service			1
when fires ripped through mr @entity58 ’s neighbourhood in 1994 , he felt the pull to join the rural fire service			1
‘ i had family that were members are after that event , they told me to come and check it out , ’ said mr @entity58			2
‘ i ’ve never looked back			0
’ since he joined , mr @entity58 has been involved fighting fires all around @entity54 , working with various brigades			1
the @entity15 is able to assist a staggering 95 per cent of the vast state			2
the @entity15 is able to assist a staggering 95 per cent of the vast state with brigades set up right throughout @entity0 @entity0 may also be unaware that the title ‘ firefighters ’ is deceiving – there is much more to the job description			1
‘ it ’s an absolutely amazing service			2
it ’s not just bush fires , there are also house fires , motor vehicle access after car accidents , helping in search and rescues … ways to help the community			0
’ mr @entity58 is passionate about fighting fires , but admits there are moments of fear when facing a raging , unpredictable wall of fire			1
‘ there are definitely times when there ’s the possibility the fire will do damage and the potential of being injured or killed			0
as well as fighting house and bushfires , firefighters offer assistance during car accidents , search and rescues and other situations where the community need aid ‘ in the @entity176 fires of 2001 and 2002 there were times standing in the backyard of a property in a valley with a fast - moving fire moving towards you			1
‘ that was confronting , there ’s adrenaline involved in that			0
’ in the heat of the moment , the @entity15 training and years of experience kick in – as does the instinctual ‘ survival mode ’			1
‘ in those incidents , your mind quickly clicks back to the training and past experiences fighting fires			1
you also have your team members around you			0
‘ but when the fire is crowning towards you with huge amounts of heat , you are thinking “ am i in a safe spot ? can i get out of it ? ” ’ men and women of all ages are involved with the fire service , and all are welcome			0
any possible time they have to volunteer is appreciated there is a great sense of community within the @entity15 , with many volunteers making steadfast friends for life ‘ you need to ensure that your life comes first and that you know when to step back			1
’ the challenge is that nature is completely unpredictable and despite years of experience , a firefighter must always be on alert			2
‘ when you ’re relaxed , a fire will catch you out , ’ said mr @entity58			1
‘ every fire is different			0
there are always complex issues around them , like the vegetation or their location which changes how the fire behaves			0
’ ‘ they all react in their own unique way			0
’ working as a firefighter is n’t just a physical job			0
one of the most important parts of the role is being a pillar of strength to people affected by the devastation of a bushfire or another tragedy			0
‘ we can be a comforter to someone going through the worst day of their life			0
an eery scene from the @entity12 footage , where the house is barely recognisable through the smoke and ash of the approaching blaze ‘ we help how we can – if it ’s holding a drip during a car accident when someone is trapped inside their vehicle or giving someone advice about how to deal with incoming fire , ’ said mr @entity58			1
while these tasks may seem daunting , mr @entity58 says it is enormously gratifying			2
‘ everyone gets a sense of reward through things			0
there are times when i have stopped and thought to myself , “ you know , i really love this			0
” ” surprisingly , there are also a large number of animals who benefit from the @entity15			1
firefighters saving cats from trees is certainly not a myth – it is a very regular occurrence			0
' the most unusual job was saving a horse stuck in a pool			0
' we had to calm down a horse while it was standing in a backyard pool , it was definitely the most unusual call i 've had !
