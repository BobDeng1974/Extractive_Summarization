by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 06:09 est , 19 june 2012 while most people are content to cuddle up next to a cat or a dog , @entity1 only has eyes for her four woolly friends			2
but the model and actress is no farmer , her flock - @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 - are strictly pets and she says she would never dream of using them for meat or anything else			1
her four farmyard friends - who she calls ' my babies ' - enjoy nothing more than following her about just like the character from the nursery rhyme and snacking on their favourite treats , jelly babies , from out of her hand			1
friends : @entity31 says she would never use @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 or @entity13 for meat she has even trained her beloved sheep to play football with her on the rolling fields near her home in @entity37 , @entity38			1
she said : ' my friends all think i ’m crazy for having four pet sheep - i ’m a girlie girl and i ’m not really the kind of person you would expect to enjoy mucking out in the fields with a bunch of sheep but i love it			1
' my dad calls me @entity48 but i do n’t mind			2
my sheep are my best friends and i would n’t trade them for the world			2
' devoted miss @entity1 , 20 , said the idea to buy the sheep earlier this year came about from a chat with her father @entity55 , 65 , a former farmer			2
@entity56 : miss @entity1 has owned the four @entity58 sheep since january and has spent £ 1,800 on them the pair , who until january had been living together happily in the town of @entity62 with their just their two @entity64 housecats for company , decided something was missing from their lives			2
she said : ' he had been talking about how he worked on a farm when he was a little boy and loved hanging about the sheep and i suggested we should get some			2
' when he agreed , i at first thought he was joking - i did n’t know the first thing about keeping sheep			1
but then we just thought it would be great to do something completely different			0
' everyone has cats and dogs and gerbils , but i do n’t know anyone else who has four pet sheep			0
' the more we talked about it the more i realised it would be a fun thing to do so we rented a piece of land and got four @entity58 cross sheep from a farmer in january			0
' miss @entity1 has since spent nearly £ 1,800 on the sheep , including £ 450 for a shed and £ 700 for the annual land fees			0
@entity95 : the four sheep have become quite tame and enjoy snaffling jelly babies out of miss @entity1 's hands she said : ' at first we thought they were all female so i gave them all old lady names , but then i later found out they are actually all male			1
' i kept the names because i thought they suited them , especially @entity13 who has a big tuft of curly white hair on the top of her head like a little old lady			1
' looking after the sheep is a lot of hard work so every day miss @entity118 can be found in the field , mucking them out and feeding them			0
once the hard work is over however , she is then free to enjoy the company of her bleating babies			1
she said : ' they are a lot of work but they are more fun to look after than a guinea pig or a goldfish in a bowl			0
' i love just sitting there and watching the world go by with my sheep			0
they are getting really tame now and will follow me all over the field			0
' one day i brought a football with me for them to play with and now they love to have a little kickabout			0
' they can get quite boisterous , especially when they know i have jelly babies on me and they come up and snaffle them out of my hand			1
' @entity12 is the brave one , she loves being stroked and will jump up if i have treats			1
@entity10 was really timid to begin with but has really come out of her shell now			1
' @entity11 is the rowdy one and will push the others out of the way to get to the food and @entity13 , who is named after my nana , is the shy one			1
she prefers to be on her own			0
' miss @entity1 admits the sheep are number one in her life and even her boyfriend @entity158 , 36 , is forced to get stuck in with the cleaning and care of her unusual pets			0
she said : ' i think people probably think i ’m a bit mad when they first meet me and find out about my sheep and maybe i am			0
' i put some photos of them on my @entity168 and my friends could n’t believe i ’d gone out and bought four sheep to take care of but they are coming round to the idea now			0
' i ca n’t imagine life without them , they are my babies			2

@entity10 , @entity12 , @entity11 and @entity13 enjoy nothing more than following her around and snacking on their favourite treats - jelly babies
