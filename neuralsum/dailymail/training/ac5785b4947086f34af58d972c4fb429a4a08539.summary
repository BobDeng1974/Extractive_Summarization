first ladies typically avoid getting into public scraps , but @entity2 has jumped into perhaps her biggest battle yet			1
she 's fighting a @entity6 @entity5 effort to soften a central part of her prized anti-childhood obesity campaign and she says she 's ready ' to fight until the bitter end			1
' mrs. @entity2 even mocked the @entity5 effort in an opinion column and argued her case before her @entity14 followers			1
determined : first lady @entity2 , seen here with students at @entity17 in @entity18 , is fighting @entity5 efforts to downscale elements of her hard - won anti-obesity campaign ' remember a few years ago when @entity22 declared that the sauce on a slice of pizza should count as a vegetable in school lunches ? ' she wrote in the @entity28			1
' you do n't have to be a nutritionist to know that this does n't make much sense			0
yet we 're seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools			2
' mrs. @entity2 lobbied largely behind the scenes four years ago for the @entity39 of 2010 , which requires more fruit , vegetables and whole grains in school meals , along with less sodium , sugar and fat			1
it was a major achievement , the first update to school lunch rules in decades designed to make school meals more @entity50 , an industry - backed group that represents school cafeteria workers and originally supported the standards , has now turned against them			0
the association says it fully supports getting kids to eat healthier but says many districts are losing money because students are n't buying the healthier @entity60 than 1 million fewer students eat lunch at school each day since the first round of standards went into effect in 2012 , following decades of steadily increasing participation , said @entity68 , a spokeswoman for the association			1
a second round of rules , including standards for school breakfasts , took effect july 1			0
' how can we call these standards a success when they are driving students away from the program ? ' she said			2
pizza sauce is not a vegetable : first lady @entity2 , tending the @entity6 garden with the help of school children in 2013 , says she wo n't allow nutrition standards in schools to be lowered her group wants more flexibility for districts that are losing money			1
a @entity6 bill to fund the @entity92 next year would give districts a chance to apply to skip the requirements for one year			0
rep. @entity95 of @entity96 , the @entity5 author of that measure , said the lunch rules go too far and came too fast for school districts to handle			1
' as well - intended as the people in @entity102 believe themselves to be , the reality is that from a practical standpoint these regulations are just plain not working out in some individual school districts , ' he said after a @entity6 panel approved the bill			1
a vote by the full @entity6 is expected after its @entity109 break			0
the first lady and agriculture secretary @entity111 , whose department runs the school meals program , oppose changing the law			2
critics of the association say the about - face is motivated not only by overburdened school officials but also by the food industry			0
food companies are some of the association 's highest - paying members and supply schools with most of their food			0
the industry largely has kept silent through the debate but will spend millions of dollars to reformulate many products to meet the new standards			0
' the last thing that we can afford to do right now is play politics with our kids ' health , especially when we 're finally starting to see some progress on this issue , ' mrs. @entity2 said at the @entity6 , where she met with a group of school nutrition experts , all of whom were friendly toward the standards			1
hot potato : mrs @entity2 says children 's health should not become a political issue the association requested a meeting with mrs. @entity2 and @entity111			1
instead it was invited to sit down next week with @entity111 and @entity148 , a @entity6 chef who is executive director of the first lady 's anti-obesity initiative , along with representatives from a dozen other organizations that favor the standards			2
the first lady 's publicly aggressive approach against @entity22 and the school nutrition association stands in stark contrast to the quiet lobbying she did early on , and to her handling of earlier controversies			2
her approach has been to bite her tongue and not comment in the heat of the moment			0
' she very , very strongly believes in the anti-obesity initiative , and i think she sees the attempt by @entity22 to roll back the 2010 legislation as just being anathema after trying very hard to change the culture of what we see going into these institutional lunches , ' said @entity173 , who studies first ladies at @entity175			2
mrs. @entity2 says the requirements are based on sound science and that 90 per cent of schools are meeting them			0
the association says districts are unprepared to meet the newest standards			0
' i 'm going to fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have in our schools , ' the first lady said at a @entity6 event where she showcased elementary school students preparing and then eating a salad lunch using vegetables they had planted in her garden on the @entity195			1
the @entity6 has threatened to veto the @entity6 bill			0
the @entity198 version does not include the one - year waiver .			0

@entity2 is determined to fight efforts by the @entity5 to soften her anti-obesity campaign
@entity5 want flexibility on nutritional regulations in school districts that are losing money
the @entity5 says mrs @entity2 's program is driving children away from school lunches
she says the is *unwilling* to *compromise* and will ' fight until the bitter end '
' the last thing that we can afford to do right now is play politics with our kids ' health , ' she said
