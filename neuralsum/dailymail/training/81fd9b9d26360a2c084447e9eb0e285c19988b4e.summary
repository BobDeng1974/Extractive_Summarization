many people lit candles as they stood in the dark clutching candles while silently reflecting on the tragic events of last friday			2
paper lanterns were released into the night sky during a vigil in @entity15 , @entity16			1
families lined up started as early as 3.30pm or 4pm , even though president @entity37 did not take the stage until shortly before 8pm			1
several members of the audience clutched red cross blankets around their shoulders as they huddled together , many of them breaking down in tears throughout the service			2
the same blankets were handed out while the attendees waited in the long line that wrapped around the building and snaked through the parking lot before heading inside to get settled for the service			2
vigil : @entity71 , left , @entity72 , center , and @entity74 pay their respects at one of the makeshift memorials devastated : mourners react as they stand in front of a memorial for the victims remembrance : a mourner places joss sticks at a memorial for victims you are not alone in your grief			2

' all across this land our world too has been torn apart			2
all across this land we wept with you and pulled our children tight			0
@entity25 , you are not alone			1
' in one of the most religious speeches of his presidency , mr @entity37 talked about how the ultimate goal for a society is to protect their children			1
tragic : flowers and gifts left at the makeshift memorial outside the location of the interfaith vigil all one : @entity1 were united in their grief last night as they attended vigils to remember the 26 victims of the @entity6 shooting ' if we do n't get that right , we do n't get anything right			1
by that measure , can we truly say as a nation that we are doing our obligations ? ' he said			0
a particularly poignant moment came in the speech when mr @entity37 read the first names of all 20 children who died in the shooting			1
' we ca n't accept events like this as routine			0
are we really prepared to say that we 're powerless in the face of such carnage ? ' he said , referring to the four other mass shootings that have taken place since mr @entity37 was elected			1
comfort : mourners place candles and stuffed toy animals at a spot of remembrance support : women embrace at a vigil held at @entity25 for families of the @entity6 shooting victims poignant : a young boy places a candle with others at the base of a flagpole outside @entity25 before the interfaith vigil deep sobs and sniffles filled the room throughout the service - but tears did not truly begin until @entity151 took the podium to offer a @entity154 prayer on behalf of the @entity155 of @entity25			1
mr @entity151 ' voice choked and crackled as he assured the mourners that @entity159 's love was there for anyone asked for it			0
adults and children sitting in the audience , who initially turned their faces away as a prayer was recited in @entity168 , were reduced to deep sorrowful cries			0
reflection : with tears in his eyes , 11 - year - old @entity171 leans on his aunt , @entity174 , as they stand in silent reflection just three days after the young children were gunned down in their classrooms , a half - dozen of their bodies are now being prepared for coffins as the first funerals will be held today			0
the first funeral today is that of @entity6 , the youngest of the 16 six - year - old victims			0

the first adult victim 's funeral will take place on wednesday when the 27 - year - old heroic teacher @entity208 has her service			0
student @entity6 will have his funeral on the same day			0
those are just six of the 20 funerals for the student victims that the town 's clergy need to coordinate and host in the coming week , a task so daunting that 100 funeral directors from across the state have volunteered to help the process			0
some have donated use of their hearses and time , while coffin manufacturers have given heart - wrenchingly small child - sized caskets for the victims			0
warmth in cold times : the @entity230 provided blankets for attendees to wrap around themselves and stuffed animals for many of the children who were in the audience attention : mourners listen to a memorial service over a loudspeaker outside @entity25			1
