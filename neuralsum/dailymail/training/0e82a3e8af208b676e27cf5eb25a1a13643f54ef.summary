@entity0 looks ahead to the @entity2 ’ visit to the @entity3 , which will be shown live on @entity4 on sunday night			1
the 49ers began their season with a 28 - 17 victory at the @entity8 last sunday , but the @entity2 suffered a 23 - 20 defeat by the @entity10 at @entity11			1
it is always difficult for a team in the @entity14 to start positively when they ’ve got a new head coach			0
the @entity2 , since losing @entity16 , have had a massive transition			1
last year was a difficult year because of people ’s thoughts towards @entity20			1
i think he ’s the key to this team and it ’s about how consistent he can be and whether he has got the weapons to be successful			0
i like @entity20 but , from an outside perspective , i think he needs that extra level of leadership - something like an @entity30 or @entity31 gives a team			1
if you look at @entity34 , he is the leader of the @entity35 , and once you ’ve got a quarterback who can establish leadership then it makes it easier for the offense			2
i do n’t think @entity20 has that presence or persona			1
he can throw the ball , but if he wants to be a dominant force then he needs to be a bigger leader			0
@entity46 catches a touchdown pass during the @entity3 ' 28 - 27 win over @entity8 @entity49 , pictured handing off to @entity51 , provides a threat with both his arm and legs if you look at the 49ers , in my eyes @entity49 is not the best quarterback in the league			1
but @entity60 have given him probably the best set of options			1
he has got good receivers in @entity64 and @entity65 – regardless of what @entity66 says			0
he ’s also got a decent tight end in @entity46 and a good running game led by @entity51			2
also , with @entity49 ’s ability to run the ball as well , the defense has to draw up another play in the book to stop that			1
not all quarterbacks like to move outside the pocket and run the ball			2
the @entity2 suffered a 23 - 20 defeat by the @entity10 in their opening game of the season @entity20 came under fire last season but has retained his place as the starting quarterback for the @entity2 @entity86 at @entity87 , 6pm @entity88 at @entity89 , 6pm @entity90 at @entity91 , 6pm @entity92 at @entity93 , 6pm @entity94 at @entity95 , 6pm @entity96 at @entity97 , 6pm @entity98 at @entity99 , 6pm @entity100 at @entity101 , 6pm @entity102 at @entity103 , 9.05pm @entity104 at @entity105 , 9.05pm @entity106 at @entity35 , 9.25pm @entity107 at @entity108 , 9.25pm @entity109 at @entity110 , 9.25pm @entity2 at @entity60 , 1.30am if the @entity2 are playing the @entity94 and @entity31 , it will be a completely different game			1
all the defense has to do is make sure they are where they need to be to catch the ball			2
but with the 49ers , not only have they got to be wary of the running game and the passing game , they ’ve also got to realise that they have to contain @entity49 because he is a weapon			1
in the @entity60 defense , @entity124 is awesome – i wish he played for the @entity127			1
i ca n’t believe how powerful he is			0
i watched the game against the @entity8 on sunday and he is just something else			1
with the @entity8 , three of their last four first - round draft picks have all been offensive linemen , so we are not talking about dodgy offensive linemen			1
but @entity16 literally ripped them apart and is quite a dominant force			0
it ’s difficult in transition and the 49ers have a couple of rookies in their defense			1
rumour has it that @entity144 has lost the locker room , but when you have the reputation that the 49ers have , it is hard to let go of			2
they have still got @entity151 in there who is an amazing linebacker and can lead the troops as well			2
i have no doubt that @entity60 will make the play - offs			1
@entity60 49ers defensive lineman @entity124 sacks @entity8 quarterback @entity157 i thought the @entity2 where unlucky to lose to @entity87 in week one			1
but the thing with week one is that a lot of teams hold things back in pre-season and do n’t show their hand			1
if you look at the way the @entity88 came out on monday against the @entity97 , they were just phenomenal			0
they have got a new offense in store and their offensive coordinator @entity171 used to be the quarterback coach for the @entity173			0
they are literally running the @entity173 offense and it works for the artillery that the @entity88 have			0
obviously , with @entity178 , you can just throw the ball anywhere and he will go and get it , but they ’ve got @entity183 to run the ball and they ’ve got numerous tight ends that they ’ve brought in to mirror the @entity173 offense			0
it works for their quarterback @entity190 and he had a great game			2
they just destroyed the @entity97 defense on monday			2
@entity178 celebrates a touchdown during the @entity88 ' thumping win over the @entity97 on the flip side , @entity197 has won the @entity199 twice with the @entity97			2
but , if you talk about offensive weapons , slowly over the last couple of seasons they have taken away the team around him			0
he ’s playing with a handful of rookie running backs and has got a new set of receivers			0
he has got a completely new offense and he struggled			0
i think the @entity2 will have it tough in their division			2
that @entity214 is the toughest division in the league with the @entity88 , @entity108 and @entity216			0
now that the @entity216 have settled on a quarterback and are taking the ball away from @entity220 , that they have got confidence in the troops they ’ve got around @entity224			0
they ’ve given @entity224 confidence and let him play his game instead of undermining him by giving the ball to @entity220 all the time			0
now they ’re willing to throw the ball , it makes defenses think : ‘ @entity220 might not get the ball , so we ’ll have to go cover two instead of cover four			0
’ @entity60 will play their first competitive game at their brand new @entity240 in @entity241 sunday night ’s game will be the first at @entity60 ’s brand new @entity240			1
i ’ve not been yet - i ’ll probably be there for @entity199 50 - but by all accounts it is absolutely stunning			0
i have a friend who has been there who said it is amazing			0
i just hope it starts to build a reputation like @entity253 did because i remember watching @entity254 late at night during the 1980s on @entity4			0
they were those muddy games where the 49ers were playing the @entity97 or the @entity8			1
old school fans will miss those muddy shirts in the play - offs			0
@entity0 presents @entity14 : the @entity260 , mondays at 11pm on @entity4			0
this sunday night @entity4 will broadcast live coverage of the @entity3 vs the @entity2 .			1

@entity2 visit the @entity3 in sunday late game
@entity60 won their opening game of the season at @entity8
@entity2 beaten by @entity10 23 - 20 at @entity11 during week one
@entity20 has to show more leadership to be one of the best quarterbacks
@entity49 *'s* dual threat causes defenses all kinds of *problems*
the 49ers defense is in transition , but @entity124 is amazing
