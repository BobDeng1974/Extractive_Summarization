a @entity1 rebel filmed cutting out and eating the lung of a dead government soldier has said he has no regrets			2
the man in the brutal video has identified himself as @entity8 and insists that the brutality of the regime had driven him to the extreme act			2
' our slogan is an @entity14 and a tooth for a tooth , ' he told @entity17			2
the unverified clip , posted by a pro-government campaign group shows @entity8 - who also goes by the name @entity21 - the well - known founder of @entity23 ' @entity22 - standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while ranting against president @entity26			1
horrific : the amateur video posted on the internet on sunday shows @entity8 , a founder of the rebel @entity22 who is well known to journalists as an insurgent from @entity23 , cutting into the torso of a dead soldier remorseless : after removing what appears to be the dead man 's heart , @entity39 then reaches into the chest cavity using a knife , the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring : ' i swear to @entity48 we will eat your hearts and your livers , you soldiers of @entity26 the dog			1
' he then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite			1
@entity39 who is @entity58 and has a sectarian hatred for @entity60 insists the video captures the first time he had ever attempted to eat an enemy ’s liver			1
gory : brandishing the organs for the camera to see , @entity39 continues his rant against @entity26 's government ' we opened his cell phone and i found a clip of a woman and her two daughters fully naked and he was humiliating them , and sticking a stick here and there , ' @entity39 told @entity17 via @entity81 phone call yesterday			1
he said he has another gruesome video of him killing a government soldier from the @entity60 faith and sawing him into pieces			0
the @entity86 has issued a poster - circulated on @entity87 - calling for @entity8 ’s arrest , saying it wants him ' dead or alive			0
' the video , posted on @entity90 by and billed as proof of a war crime , is the latest installment of a propaganda war that is growing fast behind the scenes of this bloody conflict			0
last month , a photograph was released by a @entity99 group based in @entity100 that appeared to show a young rebel fighter barbecuing the severed head of a government soldier			2
experts say such images demonstrate that the battlefield has spread from rubble - strewn streets and war - churned fields to the internet as both sides vie to control their public image and discredit that of their opposition			0
meanwhile , human rights groups say it is emblematic of a civil war that has rapidly descended into sectarian hatred and revenge killings			0
in the most recent video , @entity39 tells the camera : ' i swear to @entity48 we will eat your hearts and your livers , you soldiers of @entity26 the dog , ' his rant is greeted by offscreen cheers of his comrades shouting ' @entity131 ( @entity48 is great ) '			1
earlier this year another sickening video showed a rebel leader eating the heart of a captured soldier pr war : the video , posted on @entity90 by and billed as proof of a war crime , is the latest installment of a propaganda war that is growing fast behind the scenes of this bloody conflict @entity144 of @entity145 said that he had seen an original , unedited copy of the video and that @entity39 's identity had been confirmed by rebel sources in @entity23 and by images of him in other videos wearing the same black jacket as in the latest clip and with the same rings on his fingers			1
' the mutilation of the bodies of enemies is a war crime			0
but the even more serious issue is the very rapid descent into sectarian rhetoric and violence , ' said @entity144			0
he said that in the unedited version of the film , @entity39 instructs his men to ' slaughter the @entity60 and take their hearts out to eat them ' , before biting into the heart			1
@entity39 has been seen in previous videos firing rockets at @entity100 @entity172 villages on the border and posing with the body of a soldier purportedly from the @entity100 @entity172 militant @entity177 group , which is helping @entity26 's forces			2
the @entity1 conflict started with peaceful protests in march 2011 , but when these were suppressed it gradually turned into an increasingly sectarian civil war which , according to one opposition monitoring group , has cost more than 80,000 lives			0
@entity186 lead the revolt , while @entity26 - whose family have ruled for over four decades - gets his core support from his own @entity60 sect , an offshoot of @entity172 .			0

rebel is @entity194 , a founder of the rebel @entity22
