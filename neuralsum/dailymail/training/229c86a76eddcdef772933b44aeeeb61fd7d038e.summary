by @entity0 @entity1 was broken seven times as she was dumped out of the first round of the @entity4 by @entity6 's @entity5			0
@entity1 , the @entity8 no 1 who was seeded seventh in @entity10 , was in action for the first time since falling to @entity13 in the second round at @entity15 but it was to prove an unsuccessful return for the 22 - year - old as she slumped to a 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 0 loss			1
things started badly for @entity1 , now 57 in the world rankings , as @entity5 raced into a 3 - 0 lead and the unseeded @entity6 , who reached the semi-finals in @entity24 last week , broke for a second time to clinch the first set			2
already out : @entity1 went down 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 0 to unseeded @entity5 , losing her first match back on the tour since a second round defeat at @entity15 to @entity13 the second set was a topsy - turvy affair which included six service breaks - four of them to @entity1 as the world no 57 levelled up the match at 1 - 1			1
@entity1 , who had won two of her previous four matches with @entity5 but was beaten in their last meeting in @entity6 two years ago , would have hoped to kick on for victory from there but she was broken three more times in the final set to suffer a convincing loss			0
disappointment : the 22 - year - old has suffered with injuries and glandular fever in the past two seasons but has made an impressive comeback in 2014 , winning the @entity50 @entity49 title and rising to 57 in the women 's rankings			0

@entity1 falls to 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 0 loss to world no *81* , @entity5
@entity57 broken seven times during first match since @entity15
