an increasing number of shops in @entity2 have decided to stock the new issue of @entity4 in a show of support for the victims of last week 's @entity9 terror attacks			1
the latest outlets to stock the satirical magazine , which features a cartoon of the @entity13 on its front cover , are a fancy dress shop and a news kiosk			1
one shopkeeper said it is ' the right thing to do ' to sell the magazine in support of free speech , while another said the publication had ' caught the imagination of the world '			1
its initial print run sold out within hours as potential buyers queued up in the streets , and it is expected to sell a total of 5million copies			2
the first copies destined for @entity2 are due to arrive tomorrow , and a number of shopkeepers have already announced that they will make the magazine available even though they do n't usually stock it			1
@entity28 , who runs a kiosk selling newspapers and magazines , said he would sell a limited number of magazines on a first - come , first - served basis			1
and even though the new issue has apparently been fetching hundreds of pounds on @entity59 , he has vowed not to charge more than the the face value of € 3 ( around £ 2.30 )			2

' some of the magazines offend different people for different reasons but we live in a free society			0
' it was a big call to make to publicise it , but it was the right thing to do			0
i have sympathy for the people who make the magazine			2
' he added : ' i got the magazine in in response to customers calling first thing to get a copy			2
' i phoned the wholesalers and put my name down for a couple of copies and if there were a few extra			2
' after i put it out there on social media the phone has been ringing red hot and demand shot up to 30 copies			2
' i know some are up on @entity59 but i will be selling them at face value			2
i 'm providing the news that people want and i would n't want to make money on the back of misfortune			0

but distributors hope they will be able to get their hands on 2,000 copies , which are likely to arrive from friday - two days after it went on sale in @entity35			0
the @entity2 copies are being distributed by newspaper and magazine wholesalers @entity144 and @entity146 's biggest suppliers			1
but they have also admitted they are still unsure how many they will get because @entity4 sold out in @entity35 this morning - meaning there may not be any to sell			2
@entity152 is likely to have the majority of copies from friday , because it has up to 400,000 @entity35 people living there			0
larger stores like @entity157 have ruled out selling but smaller foreign book stores and newsagents will			0
one , the @entity160 in @entity161 , said : ' we will be selling it on a first come , first served basis when we get it '			0

another @entity2 newsagent was seen selling copies of the magazine which had apparently been photocopied , according to @entity172			1
he was charging £ 9 for the counterfeit publications , but still managed to sell 70 copies			0
it emerged yesterday that a village shopkeeper who announced that she would be selling the new @entity4 had run out of her 200 copies before they were even delivered to her			1
only around 2,000 copies are being imported into the @entity2 , sparking a huge rush on @entity59			0

at an emotional press conference on tuesday , members of staff at @entity4 vowed not to censor the magazine despite the horrific massacre which left many of their colleagues dead			1
the new front cover features the headline ' all is forgiven ' over a tearful @entity13 holding a sign reading ' je suis @entity192 ' , the slogan that has become a rallying cry for those appalled by the massacre			1
the image was the work of cartoonist @entity199 , who survived the killings because he was late for work that day			0
the magazine also includes cartoons mocking the two killers , brothers @entity206 and @entity205			0
some @entity2 @entity208 have spoken out against the decision to run a cartoon of @entity13 , claiming that it is a provocative move which could further inflame tensions			1
@entity214 mp @entity213 urged newspapers and broadcasters not to show the images , saying : ' these cartoons are not satire , they are not in good taste - they are just offensive			0
' however , @entity221 said : ' when your freedom of expression is attacked in this way , i do n't think it 's surprising that people want to stand up and fight for that freedom of expression they believe in			2
