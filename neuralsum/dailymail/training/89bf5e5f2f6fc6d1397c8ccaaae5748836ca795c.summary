as i circled the huge roundabout at the foot of the motorway for the fourth time , my throat started closing , my stomach was gripped in a vice , and my arms were so shaky i feared i might lose control of the steering wheel			1
i screeched at my eldest son , @entity11 , in the front passenger seat , to help me make sense of the satnav			2
‘ is it really telling me to turn up the @entity16 ? ! ’ when @entity11 , 12 , confirmed it was , i knew that despite the excited chatter of my younger children and a friend ’s daughter in the back , our trip to @entity20 was cancelled			2
‘ sorry kids , ’ i barked			2
‘ we ’ve got to go home			2
my guilt at being so hopeless compounded my feelings of deep shame			2
despite passing my test 22 years earlier , i was in the grip of a severe driving phobia — just like an estimated one - third of the population , the majority of whom are women			1
in my circle of friends , i know six otherwise highly competent women who have a licence but are too scared to drive , and others who are too nervous to even learn			2
but in that moment at the bottom of the @entity16 , i resolved to do something about my fear			1
i could not continue to allow myself to limit my family ’s enjoyment			2
i recalled a conversation a few months earlier with another mum about @entity65 , a course taught by driving instructor @entity67 , who is also a life coach and practises cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity69 ) — a psychotherapy to help reverse negative thinking			1
his course is tailored for people who have passed their test but are nervous about driving			1
@entity29 with her sister @entity76 , who was killed in a road accident when she was eight years old i plucked up the courage to call him a year ago , and he recommended weekly sessions where i ’d drive with him for an hour at a cost of £ 45			1
i would also have to do homework — driving to unfamiliar places alone between sessions			1
he asked what my goal was , and when i told him it was to drive anywhere i fancied without dreading the journey , he assured me that was entirely achievable			2
the first session was conducted over the phone with @entity67 asking about the roots of my phobia and what aspects of driving i feared			1
i did n’t need a psychology degree to work out that the trauma of seeing my eight - year - old sister knocked down and killed when i was nine had given me my unhealthy fear of roads			1
we were holding hands on our way home from school in @entity105 , @entity106 , and walking across a zebra crossing on a dual carriageway when a car came down the inside lane and hit @entity76 at speed			2
her death devastated our family and , as the slightly older sibling , i blamed myself			2
it was years before i came to terms with her loss			1
so , it is unsurprising that i was reluctant to learn to drive and only did so at 24 because not having a licence was hindering my career			2
i passed first time , perhaps because i refused to take my test until i ’d had lessons for over a year			1
but i lived in fear of being sent on journalistic assignments to unfamiliar places			1
if i was , i ’d experience symptoms of acute anxiety — palpitations , sweating , difficulty swallowing and extreme nausea , sometimes to the point of vomiting before getting into the car and venturing into the terrifying unknown			2
motorways were particularly scary but my big fears were getting lost — my sense of direction is poor , and my map - reading skills poorer — and becoming so focused on finding my way that i ’d stop concentrating and cause a terrible accident			1
fortunately , my husband @entity141 would happily drive me on longer trips , his work permitting			2
but my ineptitude was a source of immense shame to me			0
my first @entity65 task was a short drive along @entity150 ’s @entity149 , the busy dual carriageway that runs within a couple of hundred yards of my front door , with @entity67 at my side			0
he told me driving phobias can take many forms			1
‘ for some it ’s anxiety about dealing with other road users , feeling rushed by vehicles behind , dealing with complex junctions and roundabouts or driving at night			1
symptoms include heart palpitations , difficulty breathing , intense sweating and wanting to escape the situation			0
these lead to avoidance , which makes the phobia worse			1
‘ causes can vary but usually result from a traumatic experience , such as a car accident — feelings about which are triggered when you encounter something similar			0
’ my homework was to do the same journey alone			0
i was gripped by fear as i drove down the slip road — panicked that the other drivers would n’t let me in , then terrified of increasing my speed to 50mph in case i lost control , then sick to the stomach that i might not be able to change lanes in time to leave at the exit			1
but i managed to calm myself using commentary driving , a technique @entity67 had taught me , which involves describing aloud all the things you can see on the roads and pavements as you drive			1
the aim ? to prevent your mind running wild and imagining all sorts of alarming scenarios			0
‘ coming up on my right is a @entity201 , followed by @entity202 ; lights at the pelican crossing are changing , i ’m slowing down , letting the man with the little girl on the scooter cross ; the furthest vehicle i can see is a blue van			0
’ i talked to myself constantly			0
i did n’t care that i looked mad			0
my fear of driving was receding , and when i arrived home i had a huge smile on my face			1
over the next few months , i mastered several routes on the @entity149 — including to @entity216 in @entity217 and @entity218			0
i ’d commentate the whole way , and @entity67 would ask what emotions i was feeling at different points in the journey			0
he told me to focus on the feel of the steering wheel in my hands , the seat beneath me , and the sights , sounds and smells around me			0
i drove to these same places week in , week out , in between our sessions to build my confidence			1
finally , i cracked the big one — the journey to the @entity20 , but on a non-motorway route			0
however , it took several trips with @entity67 before i plucked up the courage to go alone			0
he told me to study @entity237 beforehand to get an idea of the route , so nothing would take me by surprise			0
recognising landmarks was a huge help			0
having conquered the museum , i felt ready to hit the motorway			1
in april , eight months after starting @entity65 , i took my first trip to @entity247 shopping centre on the @entity248 , with @entity67 at my side			0
it felt like a miracle — before , just traffic reports about the @entity248 would send me into a cold sweat			0
i was amazed to find that i was perfectly comfortable and in control bombing along at 70mph — commentary driving and reminding myself not to grip the steering wheel too tightly			1
in fact , in comparison to navigating the congested , narrow roads of @entity150 , motorway driving felt like a breeze			1
my next challenge was the @entity16			0
at first my legs felt shaky on the pedals but i suddenly became calm and in control			0
finally , i knew i had seen off my demons			0
my last session with @entity67 was three months ago when i decided i was ready to go it alone			1
he told me : ‘ i knew you were more than ready from that first session — which is true of most of my clients			0
you just had to discover that for yourself			0
’ since then i have n’t been able to get enough of driving — whizzing my family to and from @entity276 , to visit friends in @entity278 and to see our family in @entity105			1
i ’ve also spent so much money at @entity218 and @entity216 that my husband rues the day i discovered @entity65			0
this weekend we ’re going to visit friends in @entity285			0
i ’ll be driving , of course			1
and if i start talking to myself , i know he ’ll understand			0
