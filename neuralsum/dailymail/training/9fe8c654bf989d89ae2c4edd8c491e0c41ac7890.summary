by @entity0 the @entity2 government led by @entity3 , dismissed the reports as ' mischievous and baseless ' @entity2 is ready to give nuclear weapons to @entity7 to counter any future threat from @entity9 , it was claimed last night			1
@entity11 ’s @entity10 has spoken to sources in @entity2 who told them they had been preparing for the possibility for some time			1
reporter @entity15 said the programme understood that if a deal were to go ahead , @entity7 could have the nuclear weapons operational and ready to deploy within the time it would take @entity9 to do the same			1
the claim comes as the @entity21 and other @entity23 powers are trying to get @entity9 back to the negotiating table to discuss its nuclear ambitions			1
@entity21 has for some time been claiming that @entity9 is developing nuclear weapons – an allegation that @entity9 denies			1
@entity9 ’s alleged ambitions have worried its enemy @entity7 so much , it is feared that the oil - rich state is now preparing to obtain its own nuclear deterrent , raising the possibility of a @entity34 arms race			2
@entity10 said its sources had told reporters that @entity2 had left a ‘ certain number of warheads ’ available , if the @entity7 asked for them , which could ‘ immediately be delivered ’			0
the development has the potential to derail @entity21 diplomatic attempts to bring peace to the region			0

@entity7 acquiring nuclear weapons would make it less likely that @entity9 would abandon any weapons programme it may have			0
