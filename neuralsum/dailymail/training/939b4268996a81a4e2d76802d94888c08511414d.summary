click here to read more from @entity2 's @entity1 about @entity4 wages , attendances and star quality which is the best football league in the world ? best not just for the fans but for the players , and the clubs , and the national game in each country ? that is a question that @entity17 have tried to answer using objective measurements of a wide range of factors as part of the most in - depth study of global football ever conducted			1
we have considered 34 leagues around the world , from @entity27 to @entity28 and back via @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32			1
we have looked at each league ’s income and wages paid out , goals , ticket prices and attendance , ‘ stardust ’ and talent production , managers , trophies , competitive balance and contribution to the national game			2
@entity46 are the @entity4 champions , but is the @entity27 league the best in the world ? points were assigned to every league for every category — and added up to see who comes out on top			1
the @entity4 emerges top by the tiniest margin over the @entity56 , a debate - provoking result if ever there was one			1
trophies while fans of the @entity56 wax lyrical about the brilliance of @entity65 and the wonders of cheap tickets and beer on the terraces , @entity61 's top division has n't pulled up many trees in the past decade in @entity29 , winning the @entity71 once and the @entity72 / @entity72 not at all			1
two major leagues have dominated @entity29 over the past decade when it comes to sticking major continental silverware in the trophy room : @entity77 and the @entity4			1
@entity79 teams have won the @entity71 four times , had a further runners - up slot , won the @entity72 five times and been runners - up in that twice			0
@entity4 teams have won three @entity71 finals over the past 10 years - one apiece for @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 - and had another five as runners - up : @entity91 , @entity87 , @entity89 and @entity88 twice			1
@entity89 have also won the @entity72 while @entity4 middle - rankers ( at that time ) @entity93 and @entity94 have been runners - up			1
taking into account continental trophy wins over a decade around the world , @entity77 and @entity27 's top divisions are well ahead of any other leagues , with @entity56 in third place just ahead of @entity103 's @entity102 in second , then @entity106 's top division ( dominant in @entity107			1
) , then @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
managers only one football league in the world in 2014 could boast a club manager who has won both the @entity120 and the @entity71 among his career honours - and it 's not the @entity4 , @entity56 , @entity79 , @entity102 or @entity122			1
the league in question is the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) , the manager is @entity127 , and the @entity126 's collection of leading bosses does not stop with the @entity103			2
@entity127 has just retired as the boss at @entity131 , the @entity126 champions and 2013 @entity31 club champions			0
@entity136 , former @entity102 winner and @entity71 - @entity138 ’ @entity72 winner ( as well as former @entity27 manager ) is also working in the @entity126 , at @entity140 , and there is former winning manager of the @entity144 ’s @entity71 equivalent , the @entity107 in the @entity126 - that ’s @entity145 of @entity106			0
the former @entity110 manager @entity146 is also there			0
the @entity126 is therefore one of four leagues in the world who in 2014 have collectively employed most of the world ’s best managers between them - the other three being the @entity4 , the @entity56 and @entity79			1
‘ best ' in this case is not just a subjective tag			0
as part of @entity158 ’s wide - ranging study of the world ’s best leagues , we have scrutinised the trophy records of managers across 34 leagues around the world , awarding points for every trophy of genuinely major significance			1
these are the @entity120 , the @entity71 and equivalent , major continental season - long trophies such as the @entity72 , and league titles in @entity27 , @entity77 , @entity61 and @entity103			2
each trophy win has been assigned a points value , from 10 points for a @entity120 win or @entity71 win to three points for winning one of those four league titles to 1.5 points for winning the continental club titles in @entity30 or @entity31			1
former @entity131 boss @entity127 , seen here in 2009 , is the only manager in club football who has won both the @entity120 and the @entity71 the points totals for each manager have been added up , and the points totals for the managers in each league combined have been added up			2
the accompanying table shows the 12 leagues with at least one ' world class ' manager			2
by this measure , the @entity4 has the best trophy haul among its managers , @entity194 leading the way with a supporting cast headed by @entity197			2
the @entity56 is next , with @entity198 the star man , then @entity79 ( @entity200 ) and the @entity126 ( @entity201 ) with @entity106 ’s top division next ( big @entity203 ) and @entity102 ( @entity205 )			2
this table considers big - time winners in major competitions			0
if you 've ' only ' got a runners - up medal in a major tournament , or ' just ' a national cup to your name - forget it			0
the @entity4 's has the best trophy haul among managers , @entity194 ( right ) leading the way competitive balance the @entity4 title has been the preserve of a handful of clubs over its entire 23 - year existence and the past decade has become more exclusive still , with just three different winners in the past 10 years and just five different teams even featuring anywhere in the top three at the end of the season			1
those five - @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity46 , @entity91 and @entity87 - represent 25 per cent of the @entity4 , and that figure ( just 25 % of teams in the top three in a decade ) is the lowest proportion in any league in the whole of world football			1
some leagues are less competitive in terms of different winners in a decade : @entity238 have won the @entity240 title in nine of the past 10 years ; the same is true for @entity241 in @entity242			0
@entity243 have won the @entity112 title eight times in 10 , and @entity246 have won in @entity247 seven times in 10 , and @entity250 seven times in 10 in @entity251			0
these leagues are virtually one - horse races most seasons			0
in fact only two teams have won in each of those leagues in the past decade , as is the case in @entity259			0
that makes this group , along with the @entity4 , @entity262 ’s @entity79 and @entity103 ’s @entity102 ( also just three winners each over decade ) the least competitively balanced nine leagues in @entity158 ’s 34 - league study			1
and even these other leagues have more teams getting inside the top three than in @entity27 ( see table )			0
while the @entity56 has been and remains dominated by @entity65 ( six wins in 10 years ) , it has at least had four different winners in a decade and eight teams in the top three			0
the honours in @entity276 have been spread further still with six winners of @entity122 in a decade and nine teams finishing in the top three			0
the most competitively balanced of the ‘ big ’ leagues ( 18 teams or more ) are the @entity282 ( eight winners in 10 years , or 33 % of teams , no team more than twice , and a staggering 22 different teams in the top three ) , @entity108 ’s @entity287 ( seven winners in 10 years ) , the @entity289 in @entity113 ( ditto ) and @entity290 ( ditto )			0
in the ‘ small ’ leagues of 16 or fewer teams , @entity293 ’s top division has been most competitive with eight winners in 10 years , followed by the top divisions in @entity28 , @entity298 and @entity299 , with six winners in 10 years			0
@entity65 have dominated the @entity56 , wining the league six times in the last 10 years			2
