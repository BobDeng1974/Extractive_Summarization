retiring judge @entity0 , 66 , said the rape conviction rate would not improve ' until women stop getting so drunk ' a top female judge has criticised rape victims who drink too much and are unable to remember their attack clearly			1
in a controversial interview to mark her retirement , judge @entity0 said the rape conviction rate would not improve until women stop drinking so heavily			1
she also branded the automatic release of prisoners halfway through their sentences as ‘ the biggest fraud on the public ever ’			0
judge @entity0 admitted she expected to be ‘ pilloried ’ for linking drunkenness with rape , and last night her views were branded ‘ outrageous , misguided and dangerous ’ by campaigners			1
during 18 years as a circuit judge in @entity22 – where the rape conviction rate is well below the national average – the 66 - year - old has on occasion attracted criticism for her handling of sex offence cases			1
in one , she spared a former @entity31 jail for having sex with a 13 - year - old girl after saying the teenager had ‘ made most of the running ’			0
the @entity22 - educated judge claimed the national rape conviction rate after trial of just 60 per cent is largely due to the lack of corroborative evidence			1
‘ it is an inevitable fact of it being one person ’s word against another and the burden of proof being that you have to be sure before you convict , ’ she said			0
‘ i will also say , and i will be pilloried for saying so , but the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk			1
‘ i ’m not saying it ’s right to rape a drunken woman , i ’m not saying for a moment that it ’s allowable to take advantage of a drunken woman			0
judge @entity0 , who sat at @entity57 , pictured , during her 18 years as a circuit judge , told the @entity58 that she sat in back - to - back rape trials where the victim was too drunk to remember what had happened ‘ but a jury in a position where they ’ve got a woman who says , “ i was absolutely off my head , i ca n’t really remember what i was doing , i ca n’t remember what i said , i ca n’t remember if i consented or not but i know i would n’t have done ” , i mean when a jury is faced with something like that , how are they supposed to react ? ’ in @entity22 , only 24 per cent of rape trials result in conviction , according to the latest figures			1
in her interview with the @entity58 newspaper , judge @entity0 also condemned the automatic release on licence of prisoners halfway through their sentences as ‘ fraud ’ , saying : ‘ you get a three - year sentence and in fact it means only one - and - a - half years			2
‘ the public are beginning to wake up to it but it has been happening for years , quietly , without it ever being announced			0
it has been done to empty the prisons because they just have n’t got enough places in prisons , they are bursting			0
’ @entity94 , service manager at @entity95 and @entity96 , yesterday slammed the judge ’s comments on rape as ‘ an outrageous , misguided and frankly dangerous statement to make ’			2
she said : ‘ rape convictions will improve when those who perpetrate it , who are disproportionately male , stop raping and when society stops blaming women for somehow being complicit in this act of violence			2
‘ rape is 100 per cent the fault of the perpetrator			0
’ responding to her comments on early prisoner release being ‘ fraud ’ , a @entity112 spokesman said : ‘ judges and magistrates have a duty to clearly explain in open court how a sentence will be served and the reasons for it being imposed			0
