scientists have found the single chemical component in blood that creates the metallic scent that @entity4 found so irresistible in films			1
@entity6 is pictured playing the role of count in @entity11 ’s vampire novel , sharp - toothed count dracula can hardly contain himself when his guest , @entity12 , cuts himself shaving			2
now scientists have found the single chemical component in blood that creates the metallic scent that the fictional count found so irresistible			1
they said that the undead aristocrat was reacting to an organic ‘ aldehyde ’ compound called trans - 4,5 - epoxy - ( e ) -2 - decenal			1
to pinpoint the compound , scientists from @entity22 in @entity23 conducted an experiment using zoo animals			1
they impregnated lumps of wood with the lab - made chemical and found that it triggered a strong response from carnivores such as @entity35 and @entity36 wild dogs , @entity38 bush dogs , and @entity40 tigers			1
on its own , the compound produced the same reactions - sniffing , licking , biting , pawing and toying - as horse blood			1
the carnivores ignored logs coated with fruit essence and a near - odourless solvent			2
tigers reacted most strongly to the blood compound , while @entity38 bush dogs lost interest more quickly than other species			2
‘ for predators , food scents are particularly attractive , and much of this has to do with blood , ’ said lead scientist professor @entity51 , of the university			1
scientists from @entity22 in @entity23 said that the undead aristocrat was reacting to an organic ‘ aldehyde ’ compound found in blood ( microscopic image pictured ) called trans - 4,5 - epoxy - ( e ) -2 - decenal ‘ we wanted to find out which chemical components create the scent of blood			1
’ prior to the research , little information existed on the substances that give blood its smell			2
the team used sophisticated chemical analysis techniques that identified 30 candidate compounds			0
it took the sensitive noses of human scent experts to single out the elusive aldehyde , which they recognised as emitting the distinctive metallic odour typically associated with blood			1
the animals tests , which were conducted at @entity84 in @entity23 , proved it was this that attracted meat - eating predators , but the scientists are not sure how the scent evolved			1
professor @entity90 said : ‘ how this has developed through evolution is an interesting question			0
perhaps there is a common denominator for all mammalian blood			0
’ the research is published in the online journal @entity99			0
they found that the compund produced the same reactions - sniffing , licking , biting , pawing and toying - as horse blood in a variety of carnivores			1
siberian tigers reacted most strongly to the blood compound the novel may be based upon @entity109 of @entity110 ( pictured ) also known as @entity109 the @entity111 dracula is an 1897 @entity114 horror novel by @entity115 author @entity11			2
the novel tells the story of @entity4 's attempt to move from @entity119 to @entity120 so he can find new blood and spread the undead curse , as well as the battle between @entity109 and a small group of men and women led by professor @entity127			0
while it is a work of fiction , the novel contains historical references			0
it may be based upon @entity109 of @entity110 who is also known as @entity132			0
the aristocrat , who reigned from 1456 to 1462 is said to have killed up to 100,000 people by impaling them			0
the name @entity4 comes from a @entity137 order called the @entity138 to uphold @entity139 and defend the @entity140 against the @entity141			0
@entity132 wore the emblem of the order and the name @entity4 means ' @entity143 ' it 's said that @entity11 came across the name @entity4 in his reading on @entity147 history , but experts dispute how much he knew about @entity109			0
it 's also been suggested that the author was influenced by the history of @entity153 countess @entity152 , who tortured and killed between 36 and 700 young women			0
it was later commonly believed that she committed these crimes to bathe in their blood , believing that this preserved her youth .			0

in the novel , the count was reacting to the scent of an organic ‘ aldehyde ’ compound called trans - 4,5 - epoxy - ( e ) -2 - decenal found in blood
scientists from @entity22 in @entity23 conducted an experiment using zoo animals to pinpoint the exact compound
they found it produced the same reactions in carnivores , such as sniffing , licking , biting and pawing as horse blood
