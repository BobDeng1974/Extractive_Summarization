by @entity0 for the @entity1 from @entity4 ’ lantern to a bucket used in the @entity6 and a horse gas mask from the @entity8 , they are items that bring history to life			2
now they are being put to use in a project to liven up ‘ dry ’ text books used by history students in schools			1
a hundred objects have been chosen from museums around the country dating from 700,000 years ago to the modern day			1
world history will be represented too in objects such as a @entity50 clay tablet , an early @entity52 encyclopaedia and a @entity54 revolutionary plate			1
the idea of history being taught through a hundred objects coincides with the introduction of a tough new chronological curriculum			2
children aged five to 14 and their teachers are being encouraged to access images online and learn about them from reliable entries written by curators			0
there will also be information about how to see them in person			0
artefacts : @entity4 ' lantern is on the list ( left ) , as is an @entity73 coding machine at @entity74 ( right ) history : the 4,500 - year - old @entity76 , an elaborate artwork , was found in a tomb in what is now @entity80 launching the scheme yesterday , schools minister @entity81 it had been inspired by @entity85 teaching methods which enlivened ‘ quite dry ’ history books			1
he said : ‘ i often get accused of wanting to take us back to the @entity85 era , which is just absolutely not true , but the @entity89 did have that approach of teaching using an object			2
‘ that ’s where the phrase “ object lesson ” comes from			0
they ’d base whole lessons on , for example , a stuffed parrot and the whole lesson would revolve around that			0
’ the format is similar to one use in the recent @entity106 documentary @entity105 in 100 objects , which has had 35 million downloads			0
five to seven - year - olds will view artefacts including @entity112 ’s writing box and @entity115 @entity114 ’s jubilee badge			0
key stage two pupils , aged seven to 11 , will look into objects like an @entity120 mummy and an @entity122 boat			2
trinkets : the objects include a badge to mark @entity115 @entity114 's jubilee ( left ) and a @entity128 ivory game counter steaming its way into history : built in 1825 , there is @entity134 's first passenger locomotive @entity135 1 secondary school pupils , up to the age of 14 , will discover items such as @entity140 ’s playing cards and a @entity142 tea set			1
some 20 items are already available online and the remainder will be uploaded before the end of the year			0
the oldest is the 700,000 - year - old @entity147 hand axe found in @entity34			1
the most recent is a protest poster from the @entity149			1
@entity150 , director of the @entity30 which worked on the scheme with the @entity152 , said : ‘ this project will enable every primary and secondary school child in the country to access museum objects from the magnificent to the mundane but all of which can teach us about our global history			2
this is an extremely exciting project			0
’ historian and broadcaster @entity163 hailed the ‘ amazing resources for young people ’			0
he said : ‘ the wealth of sources , images and links will enliven any lesson and foster a deeper understanding and love of the past in anyone who comes into contact with them			0
