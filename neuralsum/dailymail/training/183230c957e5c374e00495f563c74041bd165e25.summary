the new rating system is part of a ' transparency drive ' by @entity3 to raise @entity5 standards @entity6 are to be publicly rated on how well they care for their elderly patients – with red ‘ traffic light ’ warnings for those who fall behind			1
ministers want to publish information on the internet about how good or bad doctors are at keeping the over- 60s out of hospital			2
surgeries where too many are admitted to hospital as emergencies will be rated as ‘ red ’ on the @entity20 website			1
those where the number is in line with expectations , or better , will be rated green			1
ministers hope the move will raise standards among @entity30 ’s gps , take pressure off @entity33 departments , and save the @entity5 millions by cutting needless hospital stays			1
the move is the latest in a ‘ transparency drive ’ spearheaded by health secretary @entity3 , who thinks standards among @entity30 ’s 36,000 gps are far too variable			0
two weeks ago @entity38 revealed how he was planning to rate gps on how well they spotted early signs of cancer			0
government sources say that the size , age profile and social make - up of each surgery ’s patient list will be taken into account to avoid unfairly labelling individual doctors			0
last night charities and patient groups welcomed the initiative , but the @entity54 called it another ‘ blunt instrument ’			0
@entity56 of @entity57 said : ‘ any measure that encourages better planning of care , gives people confidence in their gp practice and reduces avoidable hospital admissions is welcome			1
’ she added that some @entity6 needed ‘ additional training ’ to help elderly patients stay fit , healthy and independent			1
dr @entity67 , chairman of the @entity54 , said greater transparency could bring benefits if done in a ‘ meaningful ’ way			0
but she said : ‘ any approach that involves the naming and shaming of individual gps and practices or that uses blunt instruments such as “ traffic lights ” to measure the care we provide to our patients would be counter-productive and extremely damaging to the unique relationship that gps have with their patients			2
surgeries where too many elderly patients are referred to hospital will show up as having a red warning on the @entity20 website , while those where the number is in line or under expectations will show up as green ‘ while initiatives like this might seem beneficial at face value , the data that would be used to inform such ratings would be very complex and could easily be misinterpreted so we must approach with caution			1
’ other gps are much more critical , believing mr @entity3 is determined to undermine doctors ’ credibility so he can drive down their pay – a charge the health secretary denies			0
dr @entity106 , founder of doctor comparison site @entity107 , said : ‘ there ’s a huge appetite from patients for information about their gps			2
' more and more are realising that there ’s such a variation in quality between them			0
most are good ; some are awful			0
