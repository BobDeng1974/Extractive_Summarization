with two children , a devoted best friend , a loving boyfriend and a comfortable home , life for @entity1 , 24 , from @entity2 , is good			1
but all is not quite as it seems for @entity1 's idyllic lifestyle is funded by benefits of £ 330 a week , while boyfriend @entity11 , recently released from prison , lives next door so @entity1 can go on claiming an extra allowance for being a single parent			1
yet far from being ashamed of her taxpayer - funded lifestyle , the 24 - year - old describes her life as ' blessed ' and says she wo n't stop claiming until she finds a job that pays her £ 5,000 a month			1
' i have had everything provided for me			2
if i wanted it , i got it			2
if i want it , i 'll get it			2
' from being young , i 've had everything i ever wanted			1
if i wanted a @entity33 , i 'd f * * * ing get it			0
i 'm not f * * * ing getting off of benefits			1
that is just as simple as that			0
' and while @entity1 , who appears on @entity40 documentary benefits @entity41 : life on the @entity44 , says she 'd do any job , it would have to pay at least £ 5,000 a month			1
' i 'd do anything for a job - even if its making cups of tea , ' she insists			1
' if i were earning enough , i 'd go to that job			1
' but to put my kids in childcare from 9 to 5 , it 's £ 400 a week			1
i 'd need to be on at least £ 5,000 a month to pay my rent , to pay my council tax , everything like that			1
' happy : @entity1 , left , with her friend @entity59 , right , says she lives a ' blessed life ' on benefits paid for : @entity1 , seen here getting a new tattoo , is paid £ 330 a week and says she has no plans to find a job her hometown , @entity2 , is one of the most deprived parts of the @entity41 , with 80,000 people currently out of work and dependent on the dole , which last year cost taxpayers £ 117bn , to survive			1
but while @entity1 is adamant about staying on benefits , her best friend @entity72 , 20 , could n't be more different			1
' i hate being on benefits , i hate going to the job centre , i hate not working , ' she says			1
' that 's the main thing i hate - not working			2
i want to do something , get out there , get a good routine in my life			0
' unfortunately for @entity59 , a criminal record and a stint in prison aged 17 have made getting work difficult to say the least			0
' it 's like , i went for an interview for a job at @entity88			2
i did well in my interview and i 've got previous experience in similar jobs like that			0
' the only thing that let me down is my criminal record			0
when i was younger , i used to take part in a lot of robberies just for a way to make money			0
different world : @entity1 's friend @entity59 , right , is desperate to get a job so she can win her son back ' i have n't lived with my mum and dad since i was young , so i was independent from a young age			1
i used to go out fighting a lot , carrying knives with you ... just stupid things			0
' for now , she and her @entity113 bull terrier , @entity114 , spend their lives helping @entity1 take care of her two sons , @entity118 , three , and @entity119 , one			1
she even cares for the two boys while @entity1 indulges in one of her favourite pastimes - getting new tattoos , which she does whenever she has cash to spare			1
' it 's my money what i got for my birthday and i can do what i want with it , ' says a mulish @entity1 as she contemplates the ' flowers and fairies ' that she wants to add to her already large sleeve artwork			1
' obviously , if i did n't get benefits , i 'd be spending it on food and stuff like that but since it 's my money , i can do what i want with it			2
if i want to go and piss it up the wall , i will			0
' tough times : 80,000 people in @entity1 's hometown @entity2 are currently out of work and on benefits no job : unlike @entity59 , @entity1 does n't have to find a job because her children are under five @entity59 , who lives on £ 70 a week , also has a son but he was taken away by social services aged three months - much to her continuing dismay			1
' i was 17 when i went to prison , ' she explains			0
' about four weeks before , i found out i was pregnant			0
' it 's not nice having scans when you 're in f * * * ing handcuffs			0
i 'm not really an emotional person but when it comes to my son , i am			0
' if i had a job , it would make it much easier to see my son and take steps towards getting him back			2
it breaks my heart when i have to leave him			0
' i took him bowling the other day but i do n't get to see him very often			0
people think , " oh , she 's a criminal , do n't give her a job " , but if people knew me how i am now from how i used to be , they 'd see i 've grown up a lot and changed a lot			2
i 'm just a totally different person			0
' @entity1 , however , has no such worries			1
' i 'm happy as @entity23 , ' she boasts			0
' as long as i 've got my kids and my family , people can come and go as they like and i 'm not bothered			0
' there 's worse things in the world than my situation			0
life 's blessed for me right now			0
