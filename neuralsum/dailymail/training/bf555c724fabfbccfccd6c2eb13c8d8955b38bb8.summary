and the @entity0 ’s aides have also told the @entity24 that neither she nor any official from the ministry will meet the campaigners			2
@entity29 of @entity21 said : ‘ i do n’t understand why you would n’t want to sit down for half an hour and go through what we want to do			0
' it raises the prospect that they ’re genuinely not interested in this , one of the most significant events in our history			1
‘ the battle was a monumental occasion in our history and to involve some schools in what we are doing is a creative way of raising awareness of it			1
' i ’m very concerned that the @entity18 is n’t engaged in the celebrations for the battle and i would like them more engaged in it			0
’ despite not having time to meet the campaigners , mrs @entity53 , who is also minister for women and equalities did manage , in october , to attend the second annual @entity56 , hosted by the gay news service			1
there she presented an award to a group of university students who posed as ‘ naked rowers ’ to raise money for anti-bullying causes			0
