' speaking to today she said : ‘ he was this unbelievably handsome man who was 45 - years - old			2

' miss @entity9 added that the first time she met the president the day before at the @entity4 pool , during which time he eyed her up , felt perfectly normal too			1
she said : ‘ it really did n’t feel unnatural because everybody was friendly because everybody went back to work afterwards			2

' in the book , ‘ @entity94 : my affair with president @entity1 and its aftermath , ' miss @entity9 writes how she went from being a debutante from a prominent @entity97 family to a @entity4 press aide - and into the president ’s bed			1
handsome : she called him unbelievably handsome helping advance her enthusiasm as a @entity4 press aide to a usual member of his entourage and then , a partner in his bed her lurid claims include allegations that he once made her inhale a sex drug at a debauched party at @entity115 ’s desert ranch			1

he invited me upstairs , and we sat outside on the balcony in the soft summer evening air			0
