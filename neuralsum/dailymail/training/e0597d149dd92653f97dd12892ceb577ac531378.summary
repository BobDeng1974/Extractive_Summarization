by @entity0 @entity1 was full of admiration for @entity5 's @entity4 victory on sunday , but does not believe his fellow @entity6 can go on to dominate the game			1
@entity5 's two shot - win over @entity9 and @entity10 at @entity11 made him just the third player after @entity13 and @entity14 to have won three majors by the age of 25			1
however , @entity1 feels the talented new generation in the game will make it impossible for @entity5 to match @entity20 at his prime , the former world number one winning seven of his 14 major titles between august 1999 and june 2002			1
champion : @entity5 holds the @entity26 after winning the 2014 @entity27 on top of the world : @entity5 's hitting the ball as well as anyone could , but fellow @entity6 irishman @entity1 believes there are too many great players for him to dominate video the open championship : @entity35 Â ' i do n't think we 'll ever see the dominance of @entity13 in the late ' 90s , early 2000s			1
i do n't think we 're ever going to see that again , ' said @entity1 who proved his own point as one of 15 different winners of the 16 majors played between 2009 and 2012			1
' for every @entity5 there 's an @entity45 and @entity46 and @entity9 and a @entity13 and a @entity0 ( @entity47 )			1
there 's too many good players now			2
' i do n't think we 're going to see that dominance again for a while unless somebody comes out who has perfected the imperfectable			2
i think these guys , the best players in the world , are playing pretty close to as good as you can play , really			2
out with a bang : @entity1 had his own moment of brilliance , an eagle on the 18th for a 67 - shot fourth round never again : @entity1 does n't think any player will dominate the way @entity13 did in his pomp ' you ca n't play much better than @entity5 is hitting the ball			1
that 's as good as it gets			0
unfortunately you ca n't hole every putt , or else you 'd be shooting 58 every day			0
it 's just not happening			0
' @entity47 , who @entity5 succeeded as @entity4 champion , agreed with @entity1 's assessment , adding : " we used to say there will never be another @entity14 , and then along came @entity13			1
you never want to discount the possibility of someone coming along and dominating			0
' but nobody has really asserted themselves week in and week out the way @entity13 did for such a long period of time			1
we 'll have great performances , like @entity5 this week			0
like ( @entity91 ) @entity90 at the @entity4 and so forth			0
but it 's very hard to do that week in and week out the way @entity13 did			2
that 's why it was so impressive what he did			0
' podium : @entity5 ( right ) stands with ( from left ) @entity9 and @entity10 , second and third at the @entity4 @entity5 's previous two major wins had both been by eight shots , but @entity1 feels his @entity103 team - mate could benefit from having to work hard to hold off @entity9 's challenge on the final day at @entity105			1
' i think he 's learning all the time , " added @entity1 , who finished joint ninth			2
" @entity5 gets it done from the fairway , 370 yards down the middle of it			0
it 's easy to get it done from there			0
i say it 's easy , i 'd like to have a go at it			0
' @entity13 had that capability of getting it done ugly			2
perhaps @entity5 has to prove that he 's got that side to him			0

@entity122 won the @entity123 on sunday
@entity122 fought off a strong challenge from @entity9 at the @entity105
despite *praising* the @entity6 , @entity1 believes @entity122 will still fall short of *replicating* the domination @entity13 *enjoyed*
