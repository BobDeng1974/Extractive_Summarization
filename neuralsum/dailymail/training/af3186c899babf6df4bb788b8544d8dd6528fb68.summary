all along they were adamant that @entity4 would captain @entity1 at the @entity3			1
that his painfully long run without a decent 50 - over score would come to an end and that everything would be fine once he got to @entity8 on harder , faster pitches			0
now all that has dramatically changed			0
what an extraordinary u-turn the @entity1 selectors performed on friday night in snatching the captaincy away from the man they have invested so much in			0
what a last - gasp change of heart before the biggest tournament in one - day cricket			0
misfiring @entity1 captain @entity4 plays and misses at one in @entity19 during another poor innings @entity4 looks dismayed after being dismissed in the final odi of the series against @entity23 @entity24 told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch @entity4 it will be portrayed as a brave decision , one with the best interests of @entity4 at heart , but in truth it is embarrassing that @entity1 have been forced to take drastic action just weeks before february ’s @entity3			1
only this week , the day before @entity1 slumped to the final defeat in their 5 - 2 loss to @entity23 , managing director @entity34 said that he would be ‘ very surprised ’ if @entity4 was replaced			2
three days later he has gone			0
they were supposed to have four years to plan for this			0
four years to make sure that this @entity3 will not be as miserable for @entity1 as the last five when they have fallen woefully short of the 50 - over standards now required			2
now , in little more than two weeks , @entity1 will be leaving for @entity8 and the triangular series that precedes the @entity3 with a new captain and seemingly little idea of their best way to spring a monumental surprise			2
how did it come to this ? well , in truth @entity1 have never been as sure that @entity4 was the right man to lead the one - day team as they were that he should captain them in test cricket after the tumultuous events of the last year			1
@entity4 's form was horrendous as the @entity1 captain had n't scored an odi century since june 2012 cook after the defeat by @entity23 , his final match as @entity1 one - day captain @entity4 , after all , is predominantly a @entity60 batsman , just as @entity24 , @entity61 and @entity62 were when they led @entity1 into @entity64			1
it has always been the @entity66 way to put test cricket first and then have a think about what used to be known as the hit - and - giggle stuff			0
but @entity4 is widely respected in the dressing room and has created , along with coaches @entity71 and @entity73 , the more positive team culture that @entity1 felt was woefully lacking when they were thrashed 5 - 0 in @entity8			2
so , any reservations @entity1 had about @entity4 ’s one - day form — which has been dismal since the last of his five 50 - over centuries two - and - a - half years ago — were shelved when they considered what was ahead			1
the two new white balls used in one - day cricket and the back - foot conditions that await in @entity8 would play , they believed , to @entity4 ’s strengths			1
yet he has been unable to reproduce the form that saw him confound the doubters when he took over from @entity62 after the last @entity3 and led @entity1 to the top of the one - day rankings and the @entity88 final			1
@entity23 's @entity89 ( right ) celebrates with @entity90 after taking the wicket of @entity4 now it seems that @entity1 will be heading to the @entity3 with a captain in @entity94 who has been in even worse form than @entity4 and looks a shadow of the man who became one of the best one - day batsmen in the world			1
personally , given that @entity1 would probably have little hope at this @entity3 even if they had a captain with the talent of @entity105 and the tactical acumen of @entity107 , i would have plumped for @entity108			2
after all , there is little for @entity1 to lose and , i understand , the plan was always to replace @entity4 with @entity108 at the helm of the 50 - over team at the end of this @entity3 , just as @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity24 , @entity61 and @entity62 have all departed as one - day captains after the biggest tournament			1
now @entity4 ’s departure has been spectacularly brought forward and @entity1 feel it would be asking too much of such an inexperienced captain to step into the breach in the most important one - day show of them all			1
and one of @entity1 ’s best ever batsmen has been forced to accept that he will never get to play , let alone be captain , in a @entity3			0
and that is a shame apart from anything else for a decent man and world - class performer			0
@entity1 captain cook leaves the field after being dismissed by @entity89 of @entity23 on december 11			0

@entity4 dumped as @entity1 one - day captain on brink of @entity3
it follows the @entity1 opener 's dismal run of form
@entity4 has not scored an odi century since june 2012
the @entity3 is in @entity8 and @entity144 in february 2015
