by @entity1 reporter published : 14:32 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 14:49 est , 15 july 2013 an @entity3 man who suffers from a terminal neurological disease has finally married his partner of more than 20 years after flying to @entity6 and exchanging vows on the tarmac of the airport			1
in an emotional ceremony , @entity10 married @entity12 from his stretcher last thursday - just two weeks after the @entity14 struck down the @entity15			1
' i 'm overjoyed , ' @entity10 told the @entity17 after the ceremony			1
' i 'm very proud to be an @entity19 and be able to openly share my love for the record			0
i feel like the luckiest guy in the world			0
' the couple , both 47 , said they decided to marry after the momentous court decision - but they could still not exchange vows in @entity3 because the marriage ban still exists at the state level			1
just married : @entity10 ( right ) , who suffers from @entity31 , grins alongside his partner of 20 years , @entity12 , just moments after they married aboard a plane in @entity6 earlier this month when faced with where to go , their options were limited due to @entity10 's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - or @entity31 - a progressive neurological disease that affects patients ' speech and movement , and eventually their breathing			1
he is bedridden and had not left their home since march			0
they decided to marry in @entity6 as only one partner had to go for the license before both went for the wedding			1
@entity10 knew he would be unable to make the journey twice			2
they chartered a small medical plane which cost $ 12,700 to rent with the help of generous donations from relatives and friends - and people they barely knew			2
@entity12 flew to @entity59 last tuesday to obtain the marriage license and flew back just two days later with @entity10 so their lengthy relationship could finally be legally recognized			1
together : the couple , pictured with @entity10 's aunt - who married them - decided to exchange vows after the @entity15 was defeated by the @entity14 but could still not do it in @entity3 @entity10 suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , also known as @entity31 or @entity70 's disease after the baseball player who had the illness			1
in sufferers of the disease , nerve cells waste away or die , which leads to muscle weakening , twitching and an inability to move limbs			0
the condition means it is impossible to carry out day - to - day tasks such as walking or swallowing			0
as the condition worsens , the muscles in the chest area stop working and it becomes hard for the sufferer to breathe on their own			0
the disease in incurable and 90 per cent of sufferers die within three to five years of their diagnosis			0
the condition affects around five in 100,000 people worldwide			0
after the 90 - minute flight , they arrived in @entity59 with a nurse , two pilots and @entity10 's aunt , @entity95 , who had been ordained to marry the two men			2
remaining inside the plane , they listined to @entity95 speak as they gripped hands			0
' twenty - six months ago @entity10 was diagnosed with @entity31 , ' she said			2
' since then the amazing relationship between @entity10 and @entity12 has become even closer , even more devoted , even more loving - and it was pretty damn great before @entity10 became ill. ' after the seven - and - a - half minute ceremony was finished , they drank @entity104 and headed back to @entity105 , finally legally recognized as married - although they had felt they were for years			1
' in our minds we 've always been married , but now i can actually say @entity10 's my husband and have a piece of paper , and a @entity14 ruling , and a federal government that says yes , he is your husband , ' @entity12 told the @entity17			1
' i 'm overjoyed that we â€™ll now have a piece of paper that confirms what we 've always known in our hearts - that we 're an old , married couple who still love each other			2
' strong : a sticker on the back of their van shows @entity10 who is confined to a wheelchair due to his @entity31 the couple met twice through a friend in 1992 before meeting again at a @entity129 and experiencing ' love at third sight '			2
within weeks , they had swapped rings and months later they moved in together			0
just over two years ago , @entity10 felt his left leg dragging during a trip to @entity136 , and when he returned to the @entity19 , he was promptly diagnosed with @entity31			2
his condition has worsened and is no longer able to walk			0
there is no cure for the illness , which eventually affects breathing and claims the sufferer 's life within two to five years after diagnosis			0
with the onset of @entity10 's illness , the couple felt the weight of not being able to marry ; some employers did not allow them to share a health insurance policy , and they had to prepare powers of attorney , which they would not need had they been able to marry			0
wedding venue : they stayed inside the plane and married on the tarmac at @entity158 at @entity59 / @entity159 they also sold their home and put their new one in @entity12 's name to avoid future problems			1
although their exact rights have not yet been defined , when @entity15 was defeated they knew it was time to get married - and devised their plan			1
' had the @entity14 made this decision one year ago , this would 've been as simple as us taking a trip because i could still walk , ' @entity10 said ahead of the marriage			1
' it 's the progression for me of the @entity31 , it 's just compounded everything			0
i do n't live in a world of regret but i sure wish we were a year in the past			0
' next year , residents of @entity3 will most likely be able to vote on whether to repeal the 2004 ban on gay marriage .			1

@entity10 and @entity12 , both 47 , married two weeks after @entity15 was struck down by the @entity14
@entity3 still has a ban on same - *sex* marriage so they needed to travel to @entity6 ; they were there for less than an hour and married
@entity10 was confined to a stretcher in the plane on the *runway* but said he was ' overjoyed ' to finally be married to his partner of 20 years
