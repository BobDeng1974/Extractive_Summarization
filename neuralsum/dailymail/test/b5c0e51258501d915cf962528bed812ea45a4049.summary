@entity0 has launched ‘ @entity1 ’ which removes any posts that might cause you problems with your current or future employer			1
users can search for keywords such as ‘ gay ’ , ‘ black ’ or swear words and the program deletes any tweet that mentions them			1
mr @entity0 said hoped the app would ensure others do not suffer the same fate as he did			1
in february , mr @entity0 was fired from his job as a chief technology officer for mr @entity8 , the former @entity30 governor and potential 2016 presidential candidate			1
among the old @entity33 messages he posted was one in which he called female students ‘ sluts ’			2
one post read : ‘ when i burp in the gym i feel like it ’s my way of saying , ‘ sorry guys , but i ’m not gay ’ ’			1
mr @entity0 told @entity41 : ‘ why was n’t i smart enough to take care of this before it happens ? ‘ this could happen to anyone in any field - it does n’t have to be politics - every millennial is now entering the workforce , and maybe even a senior position , and everything they ’ve said online for the last 10 years is still there , and that ’s a new thing for this generation ’			1
mr @entity0 said that with @entity1 a user ’s tweets are analysed using @entity62 ’s @entity61 supercomputer and put through sentiment analysis to ensure they are taken in context			1

researchers from @entity80 and @entity81 recently studied 40 million posts made by 1.7 million web users to try to identify trolls			2
from this data they were able identify so - called @entity86 ( @entity87 ) - and never - banned users ( @entity89 )			0
the former are people that are more likely to exhibit antisocial behaviour on online forums , while the latter are everyday users that do n't show signs of troll - like behaviour			2
the researchers then built an algorithm that scans posts for signs of such antisocial behaviour , and a study shows this algorithm can identify potential trolls in 80 % of cases			0
for example , posts made by trolls are less readable			0
trolls are more likely to veer off - topic and have fewer similarities in terms of language and content compared to other posts			0
trolls are also less likely to use positive words than other users and they swear more			1
in terms of activity , the study found that trolls make more comments each day , and post more times on each thread			0
trolls were also more likely to have had posts deleted than other users			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ the most challenging part of this is determining which tweets are actually offensive , and that ’s something that will take a while to get really good at ’			1
he added he also wanted to develop the app so that it worked for other social networks and blogs			0
after his tweets became public it emerged that in his personal blog he praised civil rights leader @entity135 because he ‘ did n’t have his pants sagged to his ankles ’			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ you as a person exist in a lot of places on the internet , and i just feel that you have the right to at least know what ’s out there , and to take care of it ’			1
like the general public , celebrities have often been caught out by old tweets they posted that have come back to haunt them			0
and when somebody becomes famous , their messages on social networks going back years are combed through by fans and put under the spotlight			0
in the @entity162 @entity161 , the new host of comedy programme @entity163 , was criticised for old tweets in which he made anti-semitic jokes			0
he also made jokes about overweight women which sparked criticism that he was the wrong man for the job			0
last year @entity33 made it easier to find such messages as its search option allows anyone to comb through every tweet ever published publicly			0
previously you had to scroll through years of tweets or pay for expensive search software			2
the app is currently in beta and interested users can register their interest to be told when the app will be available for download from the @entity187 store .			0
