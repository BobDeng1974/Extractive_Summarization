the @entity0 is recruiting 50 doctors directly from @entity2 in a bid to fill desperate staffing gaps in @entity7 's @entity6 departments			1
around 150 candidates , some of whom have not yet taken final exams in emergency medicine , will be interviewed in @entity13 over @entity14 next week and begin a four - year spell in @entity7 this summer			1
health bosses insist the drastic measure , which will cost the @entity0 £ 3,120 per doctor in flights , visas , registration and access to training tools , is the only way to keep emergency wards safely staffed			1
breaking point : @entity0 bosses insist the move is the way to plug drastic staff shortages on @entity6 wards ( file photo ) some @entity6 training courses in @entity7 have been more than half empty with 135 vacancies across the board this year			1
one campaigner criticised the fact not all candidates will have to complete the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) test - designed to check they have the right skills and knowledge to work in @entity7			1
@entity42 , chief executive of @entity43 , told the @entity44 : ' i am really concerned to hear about the exceptions being made to the normal rules			0
' i can see that the situation is urgent , but we really need to avoid being forced to take the sorts of panic measures which could compromise patient safety			1
' lifeline : the pilot scheme will last four years but @entity55 , which is arranging the programme , insisted the @entity38 test was one of just three ways in which foreign doctors can be registered in @entity7			1
a spokesman added every doctor on the scheme would have to pass an @entity65 language test and they will also be questioned face - to - face before making the final cut			2
the @entity69 has had around 150 applications from @entity2 doctors and those successful will be placed in ' learning posts ' in hospitals across @entity7			0
the pilot project is running for the first time this year and comes after several reviews on poor standards , including a high - profile crackdown under @entity80 director sir @entity79			0
the worst - hit @entity6 units had thousands of patients waiting longer than four hours and staff shortages so severe they compromised patient safety			0
one victorian - era unit named and shamed by the @entity86 at @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 , was described as ' not fit for purpose ' and has had to be rebuilt			0
in some areas the pressure is making shortages even worse as medics move out of @entity6 departments because they can not cope			0
to combat the shortages hospitals have seen a huge rise in the amount they spend on agency staff since 2010 , including £ 242million last year alone			2
@entity101 , in @entity102 , paid £ 3,717 for one doctor to work a 30 - hour shift , the highest single payment of any @entity0 body			1
some doctors were paid not just for the hours they spent in the hospital , but also time they spent on call , including time they spent asleep			0
dr @entity112 , president of the @entity113 - which is also working on the @entity2 programme - told the @entity44 : ' the pressures are heaped on @entity6 ; we currently have the worst doctor to patient ratio that we have ever had , with demand vastly outstripping supply			2
' plugging the gap : hospitals spent £ 242million on agency staff last year			2
one earned £ 3,700 for a 30 - hour shift defending the move , a @entity55 spokesman told @entity127 the department was also trying to recruit within @entity7 and one course this year is 100 per cent full			2
he said : ‘ our recommendations will ensure availability of more doctors in emergency medicine in 2014 , both in terms of appropriately qualified middle grade doctors and additional trainees for the future , to help ensure that patients receive consistent , high quality , safe and effective care			0
' our recommendations promote sustainable solutions for the medical workforce and the development of other roles to support patient care in emergency medicine departments , such as advanced clinical practitioners , physician associates and paramedics			0

candidates will be *shortlisted* in an interview over video link next week
health bosses insisted it was the only way to fill urgent staffing gaps
@entity0 will pay more than £ 3,000 per doctor on flights , visas and training
