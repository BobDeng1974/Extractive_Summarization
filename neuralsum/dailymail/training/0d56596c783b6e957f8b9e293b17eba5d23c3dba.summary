by @entity0 @entity1 faces @entity2 over his future as @entity5 captain this week , with calls growing for him to resign before he is sacked			1
the 29 - year - old has endured a torrid time with the bat in recent months , is without a test hundred in 26 innings and has averaged less than 24 over the past year			1
his captaincy style has also been heavily criticised as @entity5 have slumped to a string of humiliating defeats			1
insiders insist that the captain retains the support of the dressing room , and senior @entity20 figures have much to lose if he flops after they backed him following this winter ’s @entity22 debacle while sacking @entity24			2
but with his batting technique in disarray and his leadership style under intense scrutiny , @entity1 must decide this week if he wants to carry on			2
d - day : @entity5 captain @entity1 must lead his side to victory with a big score against @entity33 to keep his job woes : @entity1 has struggled with the bat for more than a year and needs to find form in the second test at @entity39 poor form : @entity1 ( centre ) looks despondent as he walks off after being dismissed while @entity42 celebrate ‘ the worst thing he could do is drag his heels and be stubborn , ’ one former @entity5 captain told @entity44 on saturday			1
‘ sometimes in life you just have to accept something is not for you			0
it ’s not looking good for him			0
’ @entity1 is likely to have to bat at some point on sunday in @entity5 ’s second innings in the @entity56 ’s test against @entity33			1
an unlikely victory , with runs from the left - handed opener , would probably buy @entity1 some time , but defeat and another low score would make his position almost untenable following the 5 - 0 @entity22 humiliation and last month ’s home series defeat by @entity42			1
huge questions would also need to be asked of @entity66 , who has so far failed to make a visible impact on @entity5 ’s performances in his second incarnation as head coach			0
but for the time being the focus remains on @entity1			2
@entity1 will be glad to see the back of 2014 , a year which has seen his @entity5 captaincy called into serious question			1
the opener has failed to hit a century now for more than a year and , as his team toils against @entity33 at @entity39 , @entity44 takes a look at where it all went wrong : january questions begin to be asked over @entity1 ’s captaincy as @entity5 lose the @entity22 series in @entity83 5 - 0			1
january @entity1 captains @entity5 in the odi series but is unable to make a big contribution as @entity5 lose 4 - 1			1
january @entity5 coach @entity86 resigns but under - fire @entity1 vows to continue as captain and is backed by the @entity20			1
february fall - out from @entity22 continues as the @entity20 axe batsman @entity24 effectively ending his @entity5 career			2
may @entity1 ’s mentor @entity91 is sacked as @entity5 batting coach — on the captain ’s advice			2
june more doubts are raised over @entity1 ’s captaincy as the opener is dismissed for just 17 in the first test against @entity42			2
he scores only 28 in the second innings , before making just 17 and 16 in the second test			0
july dismissed for just five runs in the first test against @entity33 at @entity103 , before getting out for only 10 in the first innings of @entity105			0
nervous times : @entity1 could find his position untenable if @entity5 continue their poor form against @entity33 pondering : @entity5 coach @entity66 stuck with @entity1 when he took over but must make a decision now looking behind : @entity1 must find his form again if he is to retain his captaincy - and his place in the @entity5 side one @entity5 team insider told @entity44 on saturday that the @entity116 opener remains in good spirits around the dressing room , refusing to allow his own struggles outwardly to affect his mood			1
it is understood he went out of his way to take newcomer @entity122 out for dinner last wednesday in an effort to reassure him about his future after pictures emerged of the 24 - year - old cavorting drunkenly in a @entity129 nightclub upon the conclusion of last week ’s @entity131			2
‘ @entity122 ’s a very sensitive young man and he was extremely worried about the implications of the pictures being publicised , ’ the insider said			0
‘ @entity135 made it his priority to make sure @entity122 did n’t have dinner on his own the night the pictures came out			0
he has not got to the stage where he ’s so worried about his own form that he ’s stopped thinking about his players			0
’ ca n't buy a run : cook averages just 24 with the bat in the last year and has not scored a century in 26 innings positive influence : @entity1 helped @entity5 batsman @entity122 after he was pictured topless last weekend but although @entity1 retains the support of the dressing room and those close to it , there are worrying signs that senior figures at the @entity20 are beginning to distance themselves from him			1
on saturday , @entity5 team managing director @entity153 , the man responsible for sacking @entity24 after taking over from @entity154 , declined to support @entity1 publicly , and @entity20 chairman @entity155 reacted angrily when approached by journalists			2
the @entity20 do not have a track record of sacking captains , with @entity159 being the last to lose his job for on - field reasons in 1999 ( although @entity24 was sacked following a behind - the - scenes fall out with @entity163 in 2009 ) , but defeat at @entity39 would leave @entity1 facing the axe			1
@entity166 ? @entity5 team managing director @entity153 declined to publicly support @entity1 lack of support : @entity155 ( centre ) reacted angrily when asked about @entity1 's ( right ) future by journalists @entity171 : @entity159 was the last @entity5 captain to be sacked for on - field woes back in 1999 new era ? the @entity20 supported @entity1 despite sacking @entity24 but they may change their stance ‘ it ’s a position i recognise , ’ said former @entity5 captain @entity175 on friday			1
‘ my record was rather like @entity1 ’s since he got the last of his 25 hundreds			0
you feel awful , you begin to doubt and need a lot of support around you			0
’ no doubt @entity1 has that support , but he also has his detractors and those who fear the end is nigh			0
one of those is his former team - mate and close friend @entity187 , whose resignation mid-series against @entity83 arguably did more damage to @entity1 ’s long - term captaincy ambitions than his lack of creativity over field positions or predictable bowling changes			2
‘ i feel very deflated for @entity1 , ’ said @entity187			0
‘ i feel for him as a mate			0
hopefully he ’ll get a second chance in the match			0
i hope nothing crazy happens but i think everything is coming to a head			0
’ @entity1 was adamant he would not resign after defeat at @entity204 last month saw @entity5 lose a home series to @entity42 for the first time			1
friends at @entity116 also insist he is ‘ not the resigning type ’			0
but defeat at @entity39 on sunday , and a failure to score runs , would leave @entity1 with nowhere to turn			0
time is running out : former @entity5 spinner @entity187 fears @entity1 's reign as captain is nearly over his time is now : @entity1 must stand up and lead @entity5 to victory with a big score to retain his captaincy			1

@entity1 is no longer being backed in public by @entity20 *hierarchy*
@entity5 captain must decide if he wants to carry on in this sort of form
a good score in @entity5 's second innings and a win may buy @entity1 time
if @entity5 lose and @entity1 fails with the bat again he could walk or be sacked
@entity1 is without a test hundred in 26 innings for @entity5
he has averaged less than 24 over the past year with the bat
@entity1 's captaincy style has been heavily criticised over the last few months
@entity5 have not won a test since *august* and were humiliated 5 - 0 in ashes
@entity159 last @entity5 captain to be sacked for on - field results in 1999
