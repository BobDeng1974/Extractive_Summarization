a wave of @entity3 bird flu in @entity4 that has spread into people may have the potential to emerge as a pandemic strain in humans , scientists have warned			1
the @entity3 virus , one of several strains of bird flu known to be able to infect humans , has persisted , diversified and spread in chickens across @entity4 , the researchers said			1
this has fulled a resurgence of infections in people , posing a wider threat			1
in a study published in the journal nature , they said : ' the expansion of genetic diversity and geographical spread indicates that , unless effective control measures are in place , @entity3 could be expected to persist and spread beyond the region			1
' the @entity3 bird flu virus emerged in humans in march 2013			1
a wave of @entity3 bird flu in @entity4 that has spread into people may have the potential toemerge as a pandemic strain in humans it has since then infected at least 571 people in @entity4 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , killing 212 of them , according to february data from the @entity42 ( @entity42 )			1
after an initial flare up of human cases at the start of 2013 , the @entity3 appeared to die down - aided in large part by @entity4 authorities deciding to close live poultry markets and issue health warnings about direct contact with chickens			1
but infections in people increased again last year and in early 2015			0
this promoted researchers to try to understand more about how the virus re-emerged , how it might develop , and how it might threaten public health			0
in this study , an international team of scientists led by @entity61 of @entity38 university monitored the evolution and spread of @entity3 over 15 cities across five provinces in @entity4			2
by collecting and sequencing a large number of samples , they found that the @entity3 virus is mutating frequently , acquiring genetic changes that might increase its pandemic potential			2
a large number of new genetic variants of the virus have become established in chickens and have spread across the country , probably because of poultry trade movement , they said			0
flu experts not directly involved in the research said its findings were interesting but did not necessarily show the @entity3 was changing in ways that made it more likely to develop into a pandemic flu strain			0

the @entity3 bird flu virus emerged in humans in march 2013			1
it has since then infected at least 571 people in @entity4 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , killing 212 of them ' what we do n't know from this paper is the significance of all these mutations that are accumulating as the virus persists and spreads , ' said @entity102 , an expert in flu virology at @entity104 , @entity105			2
' this is especially relevant for human health - does any of this change the pandemic potential of the virus ? , ' she told @entity110			0
in its latest update on the flu strain , the @entity111 - based @entity42 said it ' continues to closely monitor the @entity3 situation ' and conduct risk assessments			0
' so far , the overall risk associated with the @entity3 virus has not changed , ' it said			2
@entity61 's team , however , said their analysis pointed to a need for heightened vigilance of @entity3 and for curbing direct human contact with live poultry at markets			0
' permanent closure of live poultry markets , central slaughtering and preventing inter-regional poultry transportation during disease outbreaks are needed to reduce the threat of @entity3 to public health , ' they wrote .			0

unless control measures are put in place , the virus will spread , they warn
