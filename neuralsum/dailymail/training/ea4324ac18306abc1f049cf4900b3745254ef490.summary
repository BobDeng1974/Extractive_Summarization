by @entity0 published : 20:51 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 03:09 est , 8 august 2013 a fancy dress float featuring a man dressed as serial sex predator @entity3 has sparked outrage in a small @entity6 town			1
thousands of families and visitors turned out to watch the parade through @entity10 in @entity11 – one of the highlights of its annual @entity15 festivities			1
but bystanders ’ cheers turned to gasps of horror when they saw the man ’s costume theme was based on the disgraced @entity23 television presenter			1
other men on the float were dressed as schoolgirls			1
outrage : the @entity28 float which paraded through @entity10 in @entity11 many of the shocked spectators vowed not to attend future events staged as part of the week - long @entity15 programme , which is held to celebrate the @entity35 ’s history			1
they insist the actions of the local group – calling themselves the @entity28 – went beyond what was acceptable			2
some of those who were offended by the float have vented their anger on @entity44 ’s facebook page			2
one spectator , @entity45 , said : ‘ i feel that was a step way over the line			2
what i had hoped would be a pleasant night and a good memory has now been tainted			0
’ the fancy dress parade is part of @entity10 's annual @entity15 ( pictured ) another resident , @entity53 , said : ‘ i feel there was no respect for those who were abused by this very sick , sick man			1
‘ this float should never have been allowed to have been entered , regardless of freedom of speech and expression			2
’ @entity3 is suspected of abusing more than 200 people before his death in 2011 @entity62 , the @entity63 for @entity64 , said : ‘ floats are supposed to be for fun and families			1
i have to say that i think this was really pretty bad taste			0
‘ you can have humour in some circumstances but given what we know about him now and what perhaps we have yet to find out , in these circumstances i do n’t think it was appropriate			0
’ however the controversial entry – which was awarded third place by judges at the weekend – has also been fiercely defended on the same social networking page			0
and organisers of the showpiece event insist there are no plans to vet future floats			2
@entity88 , secretary of @entity44 , said it would remain up to fancy dress competitors what outfits they elected to wear			0
she said : ’ we have never censored anyone at the fancy dress and do not intend to			0
there was no offence intended and they were not trivialising what happened			0
‘ it is about freedom of speech			0
people have the right to complain but do n’t have the right to tell us what to do			0
