' in ten or perhaps 15 years , most if not all of these former @entity17 headhunters and their wives will be dead			1
their faded tattoo - adorned faces will be buried beneath @entity23 headstones in hilltop villages in the remote @entity13 of @entity4 in north east @entity5			1
with their demise , the living memories of their unique cultural existence will disappear for eternity			0

their backs , torsos and facial tattoos bear witness to mortal combat and the customary headhunting			1
they were born into and inherited a strong tribal identity , which extended to the physical boundaries of their lands			1
they will die having intermittent access to limited aspects of modernity and having partially embraced a baptist - based @entity60			0
@entity12 ’s photographs provide a visual record of these people			2
these are not anonymous , stolen images , as is too often the case			0
importance is rightly given to the names , ages , and villages of origin of these people			2
these images are by no means the only record of these former warriors and their families , but by taking a mobile photo studio , @entity77 wanted to go beyond the superficial cliché and instead capture the human dignity of these disappearing people			2
the elderly men and women were born into and inherited a strong tribal identity and also embrace a strong baptist - based @entity60 , something which started to change the way the tribe operated			2
pictured here are @entity88 , 78 , left and @entity89 , 95 , right the former warriors are differentiated from other @entity91 by the tattoos which are drawn all over their faces			2

pictured here are @entity104 , 92 , left and @entity105 , 78 , right each photograph is the result of a material exchange , in the form of a printed copy of their photograph or a monetary one , in the form of a few hundred rupees , and on occasions both			0
but the encounters were not merely restricted to nominal transactions			0
our mutual curiosity was rewarded with undeniable human exchanges between us and some frank interviews			0
these elderly people have had a long , unscripted past			2
they are living through a challenging present and face a diminishing curtailed future			0

pictured here are @entity151 , 88 , left and @entity152 , 76 , right these images and text attempt in a limited way to explain who the @entity17 people we met are and to reveal a fraction of their respective stories			1
when @entity77 asked me to accompany him on this project , i agreed to give a hand with the lighting and translate , on condition that i would also interview the people that he intended to photograph			0
i wanted to complement his images with some words			0
so that those who would appreciate the beauty and poignancy of these photos might also have their curiosity rewarded with additional information about these unique people			1
by observing their interactions with @entity77 ’s mobile photo studio and by interviewing the @entity17 people i was hoping to discover something about their identity , their way of life and how the recent generations have coped with change			1
for the most part i relied on our guide @entity190 to interpret my questions and their responses			0
' the @entity17 tribes have traditionally had a strong warrior tradition and are mostly famous because they were still headhunting until the end of 1960			1
