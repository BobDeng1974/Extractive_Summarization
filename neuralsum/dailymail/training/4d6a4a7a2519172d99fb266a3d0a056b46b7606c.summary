by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 23 april 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 24 april 2012 ' i made a mistake ' : @entity4 scientist @entity3 has admitted his previous claims about the deadly impact of climate change were too ' alarmist ' environmental scientist @entity3 , renowned for his terrifying predictions of climate change 's deadly impact on the planet , has gone back on his previous claims , admitting they were ' alarmist '			1
the 92 - year - old @entity14 , who also developed the @entity16 theory of the @entity17 as a single organism , has said climate change is still happening - just not as quickly as he once warned			1
he added that other environmental commentators , such as former vice president @entity20 , are also guilty of exaggerating their arguments			1
the admission comes as a devastating blow to proponents of climate change who regard @entity3 as a powerful figurehead			1
five years ago , he had claimed : ' before this century is over billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the @entity30 where the climate remains tolerable			1
' but in an interview with @entity33 , he admitted : ' i made a mistake			1
' he said : ' the problem is we do n’t know what the climate is doing , ' he told ' we thought we knew 20 years ago			1
that led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear cut , but it has n’t happened			2
' the climate is doing its usual tricks			2
there ’s nothing much really happening yet			2
we were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world			2
' [ the temperature ] has stayed almost constant , whereas it should have been rising - carbon dioxide is rising , no question about that			2
' after two books - revenge of @entity16 : why the @entity55 , and @entity56 of @entity16 : a final warning : enjoy it while you can - he is writing a third			2
drastic : @entity3 had previously claimed @entity61 would be threatened by rising sea levels by 2040 claims : while @entity3 would not go back on anything he said in his first book , published in 1979 ( left ) , he admitted he should have exercised more caution in his second , in 2009 ( right )			1
he is writing a third it will not go back on climate change , he said , but will admit he had been ' extrapolating too far '			2
it will suggest how people can change their habits to co-ordinate with the @entity17 's natural systems			0
@entity3 said he is not the only one who got it wrong , suggesting other environmental commentators , such as @entity20 and @entity78 , also thought the impact would have been seen sooner			1
now he admits : ' we will have global warming , but it ’s been deferred a bit			1
' a long - time advocate of nuclear power , he suggested we should cut back on burning fossil fuels			0
@entity3 developed the @entity16 theory in the 1960s while working with @entity88			0
it claims that all of the organic and inorganic components of @entity17 are closely integrated to form a single and self - regulating system			1
this living system has automatically controlled global temperature , atmospheric content , oxygen , ocean salinity , and other factors			0
in summary , it posits ' life maintains conditions suitable for its own survival '			0
the independent scientist , who is based in south west @entity106 and has conducted research at @entity109 and @entity110 universities , has been a respected member of the academic community for decades			1
he discovered the presence of harmful chemicals - @entity113 - in the atmosphere in the 1960s			0
in 2007 , @entity117 named him as one 13 leaders and visionaries in an article on @entity121			0
in 1990 , he became a @entity122 , presented to him by @entity123 , and in 2003 , she awarded him a companion of honour for his achievements in science			0
@entity127 , head of climate monitoring at the @entity4 ’s @entity129 , told msnbc.com he agreed @entity3 had been too alarmist			1
but he added that @entity3 has ' had a lot of good ideas and interesting thoughts '			0
too dramatic : @entity3 added that other environmental commentators , including @entity78 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) had also overstated the impact of climate change in their books respect : in 2003 , queen elizabeth ii awards @entity138 for his achievements in science ' i like the fact he ’s provocative and provokes people to think about these things , ' @entity141 said			1
the world ’s average temperature has risen by around 1.5 degrees fahrenheit since 1900 , according to the @entity148			0
by 2100 , it will rise by another 2 to 11.5 degrees , it predicts			0
the @entity150 added that data collected by satellites and sensors ' continue to show that the average global surface temperature is rising '			0
it added that extreme weather - such as heat waves and heavy rain - were becoming more frequent and that there had been decreases in snow and glaciers			0
' all 11 years of the 21st century so far rank among the 13 warmest in the 132 - year period of record			0
only one year during the 20th century , 1998 , was warmer than 2011 , ' it said .			0

@entity4 scientist admits he had ' extrapolated too far ' in earlier book
claims other environmental commentators such as @entity20 did the same
