mrs @entity9 messaged a friend saying ' @entity46 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i loooove @entity34 ! ! ! ! ! ! ' when she learned that @entity8 favourite @entity34 wants to dance with her			1
@entity34 told the @entity48 : ' it ’s hard for anyone to really quite understand what she must be going through and what she ’s going to go through with rehab and getting her balance back ' ' but if she has the determination and she has the passion — and it sounds like she does — she ’s going to run that marathon and she ’s going to be dancing again			2
it ’s not going to slow her down			2
' @entity9 has become the face of a host of amputees who are struggling to recover from the @entity7 bombings			1
@entity64 wakes up knowing she ca n’t feel sorry for herself , that she has to focus on rehabbing her ravaged left leg			2
but despite life - changing injuries , both women have vowed that the @entity69 bombings that killed three people and left them among the ranks of more than 260 injured will not define their lives			2
parts of them may be broken , but both patients at @entity76 said in separate interviews yesterday that their spirits are intact and their thoughts are positive			0
' i absolutely want to dance again and i also want to run the marathon next year , ' said @entity9			1
' i will crawl across the finish line , literally crawl , if it means i finish it			0
' @entity64 , a 59 - year - old medical office manager from @entity85 , @entity86 , who ran @entity89 ’s marathon last year , said she ’s concentrating on more than just walking again			0
' i want to do another marathon by the time i ’m 65 , ' she said			0
@entity9 has become a symbol of bravery int he aftermath of the @entity7 bombings @entity64 said the first bomb at the marathon peeled her leg open “ like a sardine can			1
” it happened right after she saw her daughter , @entity101 , a 33 - year - old @entity7 pharmacist , cross the race ’s finish line			1
the mother has had one surgery in which doctors implanted pins and plates in her leg , and has another surgery in her future			0
@entity9 pictured with husband , @entity112 capt. @entity111			1
she said dancing made her feel alive : ' like i 'm floating ... when i 'm dancing , i do n't feel the need to be doing anything else			0
my joy is complete ' the first blast left bones poking out of her leg , and made her unable to run for cover			0
she said a first responder tried to shield her as the second bomb exploded			0
@entity126 ended up at @entity127 , and begged staffers before she went into surgery to find her family and let them know she was alive			0
the blast from the second explosion knocked @entity9 off her feet from about four feet away			1
the @entity7 woman , an @entity135 employee , thought she was going to die when she looked down and saw how her body had been mutilated			1
she ’s had one surgery to amputate her left foot , and another in which doctors amputated more of the same leg below her knee			0
in the hours before terror struck @entity144 , @entity9 was basking in the joy of having her husband home again			1
two weeks earlier , the @entity112 captain had returned from a four - month deployment in @entity149			0
on @entity151 ’ day morning , they were walking near the marathon ’s finish line when the second explosion left them tangled in a heap on the ground and @entity9 saw something was wrong with her foot			1
' i remember thinking , " that ’s so gross , " and being terrified that this is the moment i was going to die , ' she said			0
@entity9 crawled toward a restaurant door , before someone dragged her toward a staircase			1
her husband , although also injured , took off his belt to make a tourniquet for her			2
then others arrived to help and soon she was in a triage area where someone wrote a number on her forehead			0
' i just prayed that i had a number that was high enough to get help , ' she said			0
' i just kept screaming out , " i ’m a ballroom dancer ! i ’m a ballroom dancer ! just save my foot " ' @entity9 during a dance competition			1
she was injured in the second explosion while walking with her husband			0
@entity9 said she thought she was going to die the next day , she woke up at @entity177 and saw her mother			1
' i told my mom " my foot feels like it ’s asleep			0
" and she said , " @entity9 , you do n’t have a foot anymore			1
” ' nine days after the attack , neither @entity9 nor @entity126 has thought much about the @entity186 - born brothers , one dead , one alive , whom authorities said are responsible for the attack			1
as she recovers , @entity9 said she trusts law - enforcement officials will do what ’s best			2
she ’s hoping to get a prosthetic device in the next two months			0
@entity126 can not bend her left leg , as a grid of metal rods that ’s meant to help her heal protrudes into it			0
she said she is n’t sure if authorities should seek the death penalty for the remaining bombing suspect , but says everyone should move forward without fear			0
' if we ’re afraid , the enemy wins , ' she said .			0
