under an archaic @entity10 law to relieve overcrowding in prisons , @entity3 could legally be released from prison in february 2018 having served less than a third of the 99 years she received in 1984			1
@entity3 , a pediatric nurse , was only convicted of murdering 15 - month - old @entity16 by intentionally injecting her with a paralytic drug , but she has always been suspected of killing as many as 47 other infants in a similar manner			1
@entity20 is allowing her dead son @entity21 to be dug up in a bid to get a fresh conviction for @entity3 following a recent public outcry over her impending release , dozens of parents have come forward claiming that @entity3 was involved in the dead of their children			1
a new conviction is the only course of action that would prevent the killer nurse from being released in the coming years			1
one of the parents to come forward is @entity20 , whose son , @entity21 was just five months old when he died at a @entity37 clinic in 1981			2
@entity3 was the nurse administering routine immunizations shots to @entity21 , but soon afterwards he went into cardiac arrest and died			2
monster : nurse @entity3 , shown left in 1984 and right in more recent times , was convicted of using a powerful drug to kill baby @entity16 , but has always been suspected of killing as many as 46 babies @entity20 told @entity45 that she is willing to have her son 's body dug up and tested in an effort to ensure that the woman she believes killed her child never gets out of prison			1
‘ we deserve to be heard , ’ @entity20 told @entity53			0
‘ i mean our children were murdered and nothing was done			0
’ earlier this month @entity59 district attorney @entity58 pledged to re-examine all the baby deaths linked to @entity3			2
‘ this is an individual who should never be out of prison , ’ she told @entity61			0

the law has since been changed			0
@entity3 only convicted of one murder in 1984 because the now - shuttered @entity97 had shredded thousands of pounds of records relating to the deaths of the other children , making prosecution of those cases difficult			2
it is believed @entity3 killed as many as 46 babies under her care at @entity107 while she worked there from 1977 - 1982			1
if she gets out , she will have served less than one year for every infant death she is suspected of being involved in			0

that 's the only way to keep this woman in prison			0
this is my mission now ' victim : @entity3 was sentenced to 99 years in prison for the 1982 murder of 15 - month - old @entity121 who died under her care at @entity107 victim 's rights advocate @entity124 has spent years pushing for investigators to re-examine all the cases linked to @entity3			1
‘ @entity3 will be the first serial - killer to be legally released , not just in the state of @entity10 , but across the country , ’ victims ' advocate @entity124 , who is working on the case , told @entity45			1
‘ this will be unprecedented			0
’ in july , @entity110 , whose daughter @entity135 was just 15 - months - old when she was repeatedly injected with a lethal substance by @entity3 in 1982 , made a desperate plea to find more victims so @entity3 does n't get released from prison			1
