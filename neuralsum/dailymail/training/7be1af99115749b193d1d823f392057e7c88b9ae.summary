by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:51 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 12:52 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 will not be attending the @entity4 awards on sunday despite being hotly tipped to win			1
the wimbledon - winner has been training in @entity6 for three weeks and said the 11 - hour flight back to @entity8 would be too disruptive to his schedule			0
instead the tennis ace , who became the first man to win @entity13 for 77 years this summer , will appear via satellite but he is keen for his non-attendance to not be seen as a snub			1
speaking the @entity28 , @entity2 said : ' i have training and rehab every day up until @entity31			2
when i leave for a tournament , i 'll be on the road for five months in total â€“ and training on christmas day			0
if @entity2 wins the award he will not be the first sports star to miss out on collecting it in person			2
in 2007 boxer @entity40 had to be handed his award by @entity23 in @entity42 after travelling to watch friend @entity43 fight @entity44			0
@entity45 also missed out on collecting his prize in person in 2005 because he was in @entity48 with the @entity50 cricket team			0
' i wo n't spend it with my family or girlfriend			0
i do n't want to do it and , likewise , i 'd like to be at the awards , but these are the sacrifices i need to make in order to give myself the best chance at the @entity27 in january			0
' @entity2 , the world number four , added : ' i have a great relationship with the @entity4 , from the recent documentary to my regular columns throughout the year and i do n't want this to be seen as a snub			1
' i 'm looking forward to linking up with the show live on the night and being part of it all			0
' sources close to @entity2 described it as ' genuinely a tough decision for him , as he realises the importance of the @entity72 and what a huge 18 months he 's had , and what it means to the @entity19 public			1
' it is believed that @entity76 cautioned against the trip as it would disrupt @entity2 acclimatising to the warmer weather			1
@entity2 's friend @entity80 is also training with him , as is outstanding @entity19 prospect @entity81 , 18			1
@entity2 's first tournament of the new season will be an exhibition event in @entity85 on @entity86 against @entity87 , before the official @entity89 season opener in @entity90			2
@entity2 was also awarded an obe but almost missed that ceremony too after being randomly selected to complete a drugs test that morning @entity2 beat @entity94 at the @entity95 this year after losing to @entity96 the year before from there it is off to the @entity27 where current champion @entity94 and @entity99 , who ended last season by regaining the world number one ranking , will be waiting			2
@entity2 has always viewed the training camp as an essential part of his training regime , and missed last year 's ceremony in order to stay in the @entity108 , and was presented with the third place trophy next to the hotel swimming pool			1
a @entity4 spokesperson said of @entity2 's absence : ' we are of course disappointed that @entity2 can not be in @entity8 in person but are very much looking forward to him joining us live on the night via link - up			1
' we 're looking forward to a fantastic night celebrating the 60th @entity4 , with many former winners and some of the world 's biggest sport starts attending			2
' the last winner who did not attend the ceremony was @entity40 in 2007 who was in @entity42 at the time and in 2005 @entity45 was unable to receive his award in person as he was on tour with the @entity50 cricket team in @entity48			0
this year 's other nominees include cricketer @entity130 , @entity132 rugby international @entity131 , track athlete @entity133 and @entity135 sportswoman @entity134 .			0

@entity2 is *heavily* tipped to win @entity4 award
however he will not be attending the ceremony on sunday

@entity2 is the first @entity19 man to win @entity13 for 77 years
