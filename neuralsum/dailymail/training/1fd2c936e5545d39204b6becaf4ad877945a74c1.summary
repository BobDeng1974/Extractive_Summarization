by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 14:00 est , 9 october 2012 @entity1 once said on @entity2 that the only way young men could afford car insurance would be by chopping off their genitals @entity1 once said on @entity2 that the only way young men could afford motor insurance is if they were to cut off their genitals			1
but by the end of this year , this measure will no longer be necessary			0
from 21 december , policy providers will no longer be able to calculate premiums based on a person 's gender - because the @entity14 has deemed it ' unfair '			1
and it 's women who 'll be affected most by the ruling			1
in fact , industry experts are predicting a ' seismic ' impact on feminine purse strings across the country			0
currently , female drivers tend to get much cheaper car insurance because assessors consider them ' low risk '			1
this is not because they necessarily have fewer accidents - men and women do , actually , have the same number of crashes - but because cars smashed up by men generally cost more for insurers to repair			1
while some people assume it is therefore common sense to charge men more , the reality for safe , responsible drivers like myself - of which we are the majority - is anything but			1
just look at the facts			0
there 's a whopping 41 per cent discrepancy between the average annual premium for new male and female drivers , according to @entity53 - even before they 're on the road			1
for young men of 17 and 18 , the gap is even wider : an epic 88 per cent			1
translate this to cash and men pay an extra £ 1,776 for exactly the same policy as the girl next door ( even if she then goes out and crashes her car the following week )			1
this is n't based on anything scientific like driving test score or psychological analysis ; it 's just about gender			0
a sweeping generalisation which , for years , was considered ' good ' sexism because it favoured girls			0
proper made in @entity74 stuff			0
but what has made it worse is that men have never been able to prove themselves before getting stung			1
in addition , it takes years of having a no - claims bonus to even slightly reduce a man 's policy , while a woman 's could be re-priced from the bargain bin immediately after an accident			1
men and women have the same number of crashes , but cars smashed up by men generally cost more for insurers to repair figures from the @entity94 predict that female drivers will now see a 25 per cent price hike in their annual policy as the law levels out , while men can expect a 10 per cent reduction			1
for the thousands of them who drive carefully and just happen to be 18 , the change will be like a lottery - sized win : both financially and politically			0
for a men 's campaigner like me ( with , by the way , more than ten years of accident - free driving under my seatbelt ) , it 's also the perfect @entity114 gift			2
you see , while women like @entity118 complain about the gender pay gap ( as they should ) , they 're remarkably silent on issues like the life expectancy gap - mainly because women have the upper hand			1
men currently pay an extra £ 1,776 for exactly the same policy as the girl next door this insurance surcharge for men - what i jokingly refer to as the ' penis tax ' - is absolutely no different			1
but it is , dare i say it , complete nonsense			0
even though my very first car was a modest , second - hand @entity137 which i started driving in 1997 , i still had to fork out more money than a female friend who was bought a brand new , powerful @entity140 by her father			2
even when one of my sisters had to be cut out of a car after she collided with a double - decker bus in @entity147 , her insurance remained less than mine ( even though i had no time to drive because i was working double - shifts in my weekend job to pay for it )			2
fifteen years on , i 've still never had an accident - but am coughing up more money than that girl at college , even though her car got written off because she was applying make - up while driving			0
do n't get me wrong , reckless racers should contribute more if they drive like idiots and put people at risk , but it 's a policy that should apply across the board			2
that said , this is n't the fault of women			2
far from it - the fault lies with the system			0
a lazy , unrefined industry which uses an out - dated , blanket way to calculate risk without seeing its customers as individuals			0
something which , for any business , is always a car crash of an approach			0
but it managed to thrive for so long because we live in a society that laughs at the so - called novelty of men being discriminated against ( just look at those patronising @entity188 adverts - eugh ! )			2
thankfully , it 's all about to change , but it wo n't be an easy pill for the sisterhood to swallow			0
not least because it means the blame for bad driving can no long be placed solely at our door			0
@entity53 's head of motor insurance , @entity197 , said : ' from 21 december insurers will be prohibited from using gender in their pricing			1
' but , as our survey shows , there has been no equalisation of rates to date , so the introduction of unisex pricing is likely to have a sudden , dramatic impact as insurers seem to be holding off until the last minute			0
' reckless racers should contribute more if they drive like idiots and put people at risk , but it 's a policy that should apply across the board ' ' we expect that the implementation of unisex rates will see premiums equalised at the higher male rate , rather than at the lower rate for females			1
' if that is the case , women drivers will see their premiums rise by just over £ 300 on average , but for younger age groups the increase could be as much as £ 2,000			1
' this might be an eye - watering amount to shell out before @entity114 , but ladies , take comfort in the fact that we 've been paying these rates since the beginning of time - whether we 're good drivers or not			2
at the very least , you 'll now know what it feels like to strive for a blemish - free , no - claims insurance policy			2
this can only be a good thing			0
on top of that , you 'll also be buying into something that 's now equal and balanced			0
after all , you ca n't put a price on fairness - unless you 're an insurer , and then it 's about £ 2,000 .			0

men currently pay an extra £ 1,776 for the same policy as women
