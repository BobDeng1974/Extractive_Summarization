by @entity0 standing for three hours a day , five days a week , is the equivalent of running ten marathons a year , a doctor has claimed if you find it tricky to find the time – or the motivation – to go to the gym , here ’s some good news			1
simply standing up for three hours a day is as good for you as running ten marathons a year , an expert has claimed			1
dr @entity13 , lead consultant in @entity14 at the @entity15 , said that official guidelines on exercise are impractical and can seem an impossible task for many people			1
but , he insisted , even small amounts of exercise can have health benefits			2
the government advises we spend half an hour a day , five days a week doing moderate exercise			0
but dr @entity13 said barely 7 per cent of men and 4 per cent of women meet that advice			1
more than a quarter of adults fail to exercise for just half an hour a week , making @entity32 one of the least active countries in the world			0
speaking on @entity37 4 ’s today programme , he said : ‘ the message i want to try to get out there is that small amounts of physical activity , although not reaching the government guidelines , are still doing you a lot of good – even just standing up is good for you			1
‘ i ’m standing up now , i ’m using all the small muscles in my legs and the rest of me , i ’m keeping myself upright			2
' if i stood up like this and worked standing up , which i do , three hours a day , five days a week , that would be the equivalent of running ten marathons a year			2
’ dr @entity13 , who was also lead @entity53 for the @entity55 boxing team at the @entity56 , added that people would be ‘ entirely wrong ’ to think that small changes , such as standing up more , are pointless			1
‘ it ’s going to improve their health , it ’s going to reduce their risk of heart disease , diabetes , it ’s going to reduce their risk of cancer , it ’s going to reduce their cholesterol and it ’s going to make them thinner , ’ he said			0
‘ if you keep doing small gains , they ’ll improve your health			0
it ’s easy to do and you make it part of your lifestyle			0
it ’s not about tracksuits and gyms , it ’s just about adding a little bit of activity			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity87 said : ‘ we recognise that everyone has to start somewhere , and even making small changes to daily routines will have long term benefits for health and fitness			0
other small ways of making a big difference include getting out of the lift a floor early to take the stairs , or parking 50 yards from the supermarket door ‘ the physical activity guidelines are designed to be a manageable way in which people can start to make these changes			2
' other small ways of making a big difference include parking 50 yards from the supermarket door , rather than right next to it , and getting out of the lift a floor early to take the stairs			0
dr @entity13 , who was chief medical officer for the @entity116 @entity115 team in 2010 , said : ‘ i say to patients , when you get on the escalator do n’t just stand on the escalator and let it take you up to the next floor , actually walk up one step			1
just one step because although it seems like a tiny amount of physical activity , all that builds up			0

dr @entity13 says even small amounts of activity are beneficial
over a year , standing for 3hrs each day would equate to 10 marathons
' it *'s* not about tracksuits and gyms , it ’s about adding a little bit of activity '
