police are still searching for the motive of @entity3 's killing spree , but one working theory is that he was angry that his mother was planning to commit him to a psychiatric facility because he was becoming too difficult for her to handle alone			1
given his decision to kill his mother @entity10 while she lay sleeping in her bed at their @entity13 home and then drive to his former elementary school to purposefully kill innocent children , there had to be a strong connection in his mind between his anger and the school			1
@entity10 , 52 , was thought to volunteer at @entity21 , and so the theory extends to the fact that @entity3 felt he loved those children more than she loved him , since she was planning to send him away			1
@entity26 was running out : @entity21 was searching for other places to have her son @entity3 educated and traveled all over the world to find something suitable @entity32 quotes a neighborhood figure , whose father works as the pastor of an area church , as saying that the 20 - year - old shooter found out that his mother was in the legal process of having him committed and was upset			1
that news , coupled with his jealousy of the time she allegedly spent with a group of kindergarteners at @entity21 , is thought to have served as the basis of the killing			1
a number of factors are still unconfirmed in the theory , and it appears that they may remain as such for some time			0
records of conservatorship filings , which @entity21 would have needed to make in order to commit her son since he is over 18 - years - old , are sealed by the courts so if any such filings were made they will not be released publicly			1
' @entity3 believed she cared more for the children than she did for him , and the reason he probably thought this ( was the fact that ) she was petitioning for conservatorship and wanted to have him committed , ' @entity62 told @entity32			1
house of horrors : it is thought that @entity10 was planning a move from their house in @entity74 , pictured , for @entity75 to find a place for @entity3 to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled 20 - year - old struggling : various family friends have said that she warned that you could never turn your back on @entity3 while he was in your care , explaining why it may have been taking a toll on her prompting for her to look for options one of the biggest questions remaining ever since the shooting was reported on friday was @entity10 's connection to the school which was clearly singled out as a target by @entity3			1
the majority of his shooting was limited to the reception , where he forced his way into the building and killed those standing in his way , and then to a single first grade classroom			0
those children are thought to be the ones that @entity10 grew close with during the last academic year , when they were in kindergarten			0
initial reports immediately after the shooting claimed that @entity10 was a full time or even substitute teacher at the elementary school , though as the chaos of the day slowed , school officials said that she was not on any records of having worked there in any formal capacity			0
targeted : all but one of the students in this first grade class were killed by gunman @entity3 , prompting the theory that he chose them because his mother worked with that group as a volunteer unanswered questions : it is still unclear what @entity21 's connection was to @entity21 , though it is confirmed that @entity3 attended it as a child that option leaves the possibility open that she volunteered her time with the young children , though school board member @entity133 could not confirm that role when asked by @entity135			1
that was echoed by @entity137 , a former school board member who told the @entity138 : ‘ no one has heard of her			0
teachers do n’t know her			0
’ though the court records will never back up the claim that @entity10 was trying to have her son committed , her actions do lend credence to the idea because she had spent much time over the course of this year traveling to different schools to find a suitable place to send @entity3			1
former babysitters of @entity3 's said that she warned that she could never turn her back on the young boy , meaning that when she went to visit prospective schools , @entity3 was either with her or very aware of the fact that she had gone shopping for his next home			1
in a @entity159 conversation between @entity10 and her former sister - in - law @entity160 , @entity10 revealed that she had wanted to downsize from her $ 1.4million home in @entity74			2
' i am still in the same place but getting to the point where i may want a smaller house			0
i travel a lot , spend time with friends , work with a couple of charities , ' she wrote in one of the messages			0
as a teenager , @entity3 would come in for a haircut about every six weeks without speaking or looking at anyone and always accompanied by his mother , said stylists at a @entity74 salon			1
he stopped coming in a few years ago , and the employees at the salon thought he had moved away , said stylist @entity180			0
adam in the chair : hairstylist @entity182 said @entity3 was difficult to deal with the comments from him and his colleagues were among the first describing how the @entity185 interacted with each other			2
investigators have found no letters or diaries that could explain the attack , one of the deadliest mass shootings in @entity194 history			0
cutting @entity3 's hair ' was a very long half an hour			1
it was a very uncomfortable situation , ' stylist @entity182 said			0
she said that she never heard his voice and that @entity21 also hardly spoke			2
another stylist , @entity199 , echoed their descriptions of the @entity202 and added that @entity21 would give her son directions about what to do and where to go			2
@entity3 would move only ' when his mother told him to , ' @entity180 said			2
' i would say , " @entity3 , come on			0
" he would n't move , ' @entity180 said			0
' and his mother would have to say , " @entity3 , come on , he 's ready			1
" it was like i was invisible			0
' he said @entity3 also would n't move from his chair after his hair was cut until his mother told him to.if a stylist would ask @entity3 a question , @entity180 said , his mother would answer			2
' he would just be looking down at the tiles ... the whole time , ' @entity215 classmates have previously described @entity3 as intelligent but remote , and former high school adviser described him as anxious and shy			2
several people who knew his mother have described her as a devoted @entity221 paperwork released this week showed that @entity21 had the authority to make all decisions regarding @entity3 's upbringing			1
the divorce was finalized in september 2009 , when @entity3 was 17			0
