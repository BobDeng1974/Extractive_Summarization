by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:09 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 10:44 est , 24 october 2012 chancellor @entity3 's plans to claw back child benefit from better - off families have been criticised for being too complicated thousands of people earning more than £ 50,000 will lose some of their pay if they move in with a new partner who has children , accountants have warned			1
tax experts at @entity12 said the ‘ bizarre ’ anomaly was the result of government plans to claw back child benefit from homes where at least one resident is a higher earner			1
the changes are due to come into force in just 10 weeks , and the @entity21 has been forced to insist they remain on track despite hundreds of thousands of families affected being in the dark that they will lose money from january 1			2
letters are due to be sent to all those paid under @entity29 and earning more than £ 50,000 by @entity30 next week			1
yesterday @entity1 revealed child benefit is being paid to 40,000 children living outside the @entity33 , despite plans to cut the money for families in the @entity33			1
under the changes , if one person in the home earns £ 50,000 or more , the entitlement to child benefit will be gradually cut			1
if anyone earns more than £ 60,000 , they will lose child benefit all together			1
but instead of reducing the amount of child benefit paid out , the money is to be clawed back in additional tax imposed on the higher earner , regardless of whether they are the person who receives child benefit or even a parent			1
it means 500,000 people will have to fill out self - assessment tax forms for the first time			0
@entity53 , a tax director in @entity12 ’s private client services division , said : ‘ if you have a standard family with 2.4 children and two married parents all living together then the system is reasonably straightforward			0
‘ but it can get really bizarre			0
if the parents get divorced and the children live with the mother who has a new partner , and that partner is the higher earner , then he gets [ to pay ] the clawback even though they are not his children , ’ she told the @entity61			0
ms @entity53 added : ‘ some scenarios look overcomplicated , but in today ’s complex family arrangements , they may well happen			0
' if an estranged father is claiming child benefit for children who live with their mother and this father has a new partner – who happens to earn more than him – then this partner may be liable to pay the money back if they earn over the threshold			2
a spokesman for @entity30 insisted the process of explaining the changes was on course , but admitted new partners could be liable for the charge following a divorce			0
he added : ‘ letters explaining the new child benefit rules are ready to be sent and will be issued in batches from next week , on schedule and according to plan			2
' there are no delays , and plenty of time for those affected to consider their options and make an informed choice in time for the 7 january rule change			0
‘ we will also launch a section on our website designed specifically to help taxpayers with the new arrangements			0

@entity3 is to claw back child benefit from homes where someone earns more than £ 50,000
accountants @entity12 say ' bizarre ' anomalies mean people who are not parents could lose money
@entity30 insists the plans are on course and letters will be sent out next week
