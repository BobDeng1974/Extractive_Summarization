by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 08:41 est , 15 march 2013 a 32 - year - old man has been adopted by his former foster mother after being reunited with her following a decade - long separation			1
@entity4 was removed from his foster family at the age of 13 , but never found a permanent home and longed to return to them			1
and today the burly adult will officially be adopted by @entity10 , who took him into her @entity13 home in the 1980s			1
they agreed to foster him at their home near @entity26 - partly because they were an interracial couple and the boy was mixed race			2
' interracial relationships were n't as common or accepted as they are today , and the fact that @entity4 was biracial and we were a biracial family made us a great " profile " , ' ms @entity10 said			1
the youngster also got on well with his younger foster brothers , @entity39 and @entity40 , whom he described as his ' best friends '			0
family : @entity4 was considered a good fit with ms @entity10 's interracial family as he was mixed race ' best friends ' : @entity4 quickly bonded with his younger foster siblings but was forced to leave the home harmonious : but ms @entity10 's husband @entity20 died in 1998 , and she later remarried the family was planning to adopt their newest addition , but when he was 13 child welfare authorities intervened			1
@entity4 was removed from his foster parents when officials discovered that they had been spanking him when he misbehaved , as they did with their other sons			1
' we wanted him to feel like the rest of our kids , ' ms @entity56 said			0
' and there was a difference of opinion with some of the supervisors			0
' although the couple fought fiercely to keep the boy , they were forced to give up when they were threatened with losing their biological children too			0
@entity4 spent the rest of his childhood moving from one foster home to another , and says he never found the same connection with a family again			1
' i could n't talk to anybody about it because nobody was there , ' he told @entity22			0
' i could n't call somebody - there was just a void in me			0
' together again : the pair found each other via @entity87 and will now make their family relationship legal emotional : when they first talked on the telephone mr @entity4 was overcome by the strength of feeling with the rise of social networking , mr @entity4 saw the opportunity to re-connect with his would - be relatives			2
however , ms @entity10 's husband had died in 1998 , and she had subsequently changed her name after remarrying , which complicated the search			2
in 2007 , the foster mother and son made contact via @entity87 - and then ms @entity10 decided to phone mr @entity4			1
' she said , " hey baby " - and i said , " i got to call you back , " ' he said as he recalled how he was overcome with emotion			0
they have now decided to ' make it official ' , and on friday they are heading to a courtroom to apply for mr @entity4 to be adopted by ms @entity10			2
' it has to happen , ' he told @entity22			0
' i did n't fight for all those years for no reason			0
