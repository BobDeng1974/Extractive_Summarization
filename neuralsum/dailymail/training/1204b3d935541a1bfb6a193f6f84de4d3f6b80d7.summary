the flu season only kicked off in late december but there are already signs that the @entity2 could be heading for an epidemic , with the number affected at its highest level for three years			1
last week , doctors reported a ' significant rise ' in the number of hospital admissions , while @entity10 , a @entity12 - wide monitoring system , says reported cases across all age groups has doubled in seven days - a much bigger leap compared with the same time last year			0
with the flu season not set to peak for six weeks , many more people could be affected , so what 's going on ? around 20 per cent of samples taken from people with flu and tested by @entity23 have been found to be ' drifted ' strains - or mutations - of @entity26 the problem is being blamed on the nature of this particular flu virus and the fact it has mutated			1
the jab is designed to prevent the most widespread flu virus , known as @entity26			1
however , the mutations of the virus appear resistant to it			1
in hospitals , around 20 per cent of samples taken from people with flu and tested by @entity23 have been found to be ' drifted ' strains - or mutations - of @entity26			1
this rate of mutation is ten times higher than normal			1
meanwhile , the @entity44 @entity43 have announced that half of their samples are mutations			1
what does all this mean for you and your family ? we ask the country 's top experts for their advice			0
am i safe if i 've had the @entity56 ? every year the flu jab is different , protecting against the three flu types scientists have identified as being those likely to cause the most problems in the flu season			1
the scientists gather each february at the hq of the @entity64 in @entity65 and base their decision on what happened the previous winter in the @entity69 ( when it was our summer ) ; this gives an early indication of which flu viruses are likely to affect us next			1
the vaccines are developed and given in october or november , before the flu season starts in the northern hemisphere			1
every year the flu jab is different , protecting against the three flu types this year , scientists pinpointed one strain as the major cause of flu in 2015 - @entity86 a type @entity26			1
although @entity26 is not as virulent as some other strains , it mutates very easily , so the vaccine is not as protective against it			1
' around 20 per cent of patients are infected with mutated strains which is higher than we expect - this figure would usually be around 2 per cent , ' says @entity96 , professor of virology at @entity98 and the @entity99 at @entity100			2
' for some reason , this year 's strain mutates quickly - it 's impossible to say why this virus behaves differently			2
' is this ' mutant ' flu more risky ? the short answer is no. ' it wo n't make any difference to healthy adults who have strong immune systems - and there 's no reason to believe a mutated form of @entity26 will give you a worse dose of flu , ' explains professor @entity96			1
nor are the new mutations more infectious			2
however , importantly , vulnerable people who 've had the flu jab may not be as well protected and may develop flu symptoms			1
people considered at risk of flu are offered a free jab every year			1
they include : the over- 65s ; pregnant women ; patients with certain medical conditions including asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( including emphysema ) and diabetes ; those living in a care home ; carers and healthcare workers			0
children aged two to four are also offered vaccination ( as a nasal spray )			0
last week , dr @entity140 , a specialist in respiratory medicine at @entity142 , said they had admitted many more patients in the at - risk groups who should have been protected by their annual flu jab			1
' we have seen the number of patients , mainly those with respiratory conditions such as asthma or @entity154 , being admitted as emergencies increase from 25 - 30 a day to more than 50			0
' around half have the @entity26 virus			1
' the numbers have been far higher and there is no sign of that letting up any time soon			2
' who is most likely to get it ? this year 's ' top ' flu bug is more likely to a problem for older people and very young children , not because they are more likely to be infected but because their symptoms would be worse			2
' older people tend to have lowered immunity and other health issues , such as @entity154 or diabetes , which may make them more vulnerable to serious complications , ' explains professor @entity96			0
@entity86 can lead to pneumonia , which can be deadly			0
' small children are at a mechanical disadvantage because they have smaller airways , so inflammation can have a more serious effect and lead to dangerous breathing difficulties , ' he adds			0
this year 's ' top ' flu bug is more likely to a problem for older people and very young children is flu causing the @entity183 ? while dr @entity140 says the number of patients admitted with respiratory illnesses as an emergency has doubled , professor @entity96 says there is no evidence the mutant @entity26 viruses have been behind overcrowding in crisis - hit @entity183 departments			1
instead , other respiratory infections and the norovirus have been mainly responsible			0
figures from @entity23 revealed the winter norovirus season started early when there were 18 outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals across @entity23 in october - 17 led to ward closures			0
three wards at @entity142 closed to new admissions due to outbreaks of diarrhoea and vomiting			0
@entity208 , emeritus professor of bacteriology at the @entity210 , explains : ' @entity211 does happen all year round but the main season does seem to have started off a bit earlier this year			0
' an earlier start will be having an impact			0
' wearing a face mask , a popular preventative measure in the @entity218 , wo n't make a huge difference to whether you catch the virus , says professor @entity96			2
' these masks can stop transmission via large droplets , but the virus can still go straight through in an aerosol form , i.e. as a mist of tiny liquid particles			2
masks should not be considered an alternative to having the jab			2
' there 's no hard evidence that vitamin c can boost your immune system , although a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is good for general health			0
' wash your hands thoroughly , particularly before eating , and use an anti-viral gel regularly and often , ' says professor @entity96			0
for those worried about loved ones in care homes , the key is good hygiene practices , says professor @entity96			0
' and people should not visit a care home if they suspect they have the flu			2
' is the flu jab a waste of time ? no , says professor @entity96 , who points out that it protects against two other kinds of flu strains as well as @entity26			1
' it also protects against the serious @entity260 strain ( swine flu ) which caused the pandemic in 2009 , and @entity264 / @entity263 / 2 , a strain which was active in 2012			2
' also , while he ca n't say for sure , he believes that even mutated versions of @entity26 will be weakened by the antibodies in the jab			1
' it may mean people get a less serious version of the flu virus with milder symptoms			1
i would be very surprised if the jab offered no protection at all			2
' dr @entity277 , head of seasonal flu surveillance at @entity23 , adds : ' existing vaccine is likely to still provide some protection and getting vaccinated remains the best way to protect yourself from flu			2
' @entity283 , research fellow in @entity284 at the @entity285 , who runs @entity287 in the @entity2 , says that no one should be put off having a jab because @entity26 mutations have been found			1
' we want to encourage all vulnerable people to have the vaccine if they have n't already done so			0
' the best time is the autumn before the season starts , but it is possible to have the jab later , as long as stocks are left			0
if you are not eligible for a free jab , you can pay for one at many pharmacists			0
what about children ? from september 2013 , flu vaccinations were added to the childhood immunisation schedule and children aged two , three and four are now automatically offered vaccination , although many are still to take it up			0
older children with asthma may be eligible for a free jab - talk to your gp or practice nurse			0
uptake among children is around 40 per cent			0
' not only is it important for the child 's protection , but children are known to be virus spreaders and can easily transmit infection to grand - parents and other vulnerable family members , ' says professor @entity96 .			0

the jab is designed to prevent the most widespread flu virus , @entity26
however , the mutations of the virus appear resistant to it
the rate of mutation is ten times higher than normal
