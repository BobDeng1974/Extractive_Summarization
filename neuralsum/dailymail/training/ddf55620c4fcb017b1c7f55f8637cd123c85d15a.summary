by @entity0 an incredible collection of bibles that were the first - ever to land on the moon has sold for more than $ 130,000			0
the complete set of microfilm lunar bibles were carried on board the @entity7 12 , 13 , and 14 missions			1
the set was made even more special as the @entity7 bibles survived the ill - fated mission in 1970 and returned to @entity12 safely with the crew			2
unique : it is the only complete set of flown microfilm lunar bibles to have been carried on board the @entity7 12 , 13 and 14 missions they were saved and eventually made it to the moon with the @entity23 mission , making them the first to ever to arrive on the lunar surface			1
the collection went under the hammer at @entity28 , in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , on friday and sold for $ 130,000 - just over £ 80,000			0
the @entity32 was founded by reverend @entity33 for the purpose of praying for space missions after the ill - fated @entity7 1 mission that saw three astronauts - @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 - die in a fire during a launch pad test in 1967			1
new technology : @entity44 meant that all 1245 pages and more than 773,000 words of the @entity47 could be reduced down to fit on a small piece of film valuable : the collection went under the hammer at @entity28 , in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , on friday and sold for $ 130,000 - just over £ 80,000 before his death @entity38 had told a reporter that he hoped one day to carry a @entity47 to the moon , so in the aftermath of the tragedy the @entity55 adopted the challenge on his behalf			1
due to restrictions on personal items that could be carried by the @entity7 astronauts , the @entity47 posed a significant weight problem that needed to be solved			2
in order to make it small enough and light enough to be taken on board , the @entity32 brought in new microfilm technology to shrink it down			2
this meant that all 1,245 pages and more than 773,000 words of the @entity47 could be reduced down to fit on a small piece of film the size of a colour slide			0
support : soon after the apollo 1 mission tragedy the @entity77 swelled to over 40,000 @entity80 employees success : @entity23 launched in january 1971 taking with it 300 copies of the @entity47 in microfilm soon after membership in the league swelled to over 40,000 @entity80 employees , and efforts were begun on the @entity88			1
@entity89 eventually gained permission for a single microfilm copy of the @entity93 bible to be taken on board @entity95			0
but his efforts to get the @entity47 to the moon were thwarted when the document was stored in the command module rather than the lunar module - meaning it did not descend to the lunar surface			0
the @entity32 then purchased a number of the microfilm bibles and 512 were packaged up to be sent with the @entity7 mission in an effort once again to deliver them to the moon			2
but the ill - fated mission suffered an on - board explosion in space , and it too circled the moon and returned to @entity12 without landing			0
despite the failed efforts of getting the @entity117 to the moon on the @entity95 and 13 missions , the league 's dreams were finally realised when @entity23 brought 300 of them to the moon on february 5 , 1971			1
determined @entity122 had split the bibles this time , placing 100 in the lunar module and 200 in the command module to improve their chances of success .			0

the complete set of microfilm lunar bibles were carried on board the @entity7 12 , 13 , and 14 missions
they were produced by the @entity77 set up to pray for astronauts following the @entity7 1 disaster , in which three died
one of them , @entity38 , said before his death that he hoped to take a @entity47 to the moon so the @entity32 decided to do it in his *honour*
after *orbiting* the moon in @entity95 and then surviving an explosion on the @entity7 , they finally made it to the moon on @entity23 in 1971
