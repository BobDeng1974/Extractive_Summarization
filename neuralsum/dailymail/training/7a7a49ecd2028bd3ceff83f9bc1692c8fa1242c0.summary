@entity1 ’s £ 80million price tag when he moved from @entity2 to @entity3 last summer caused plenty of eyebrows to be raised , and now a new report suggests the @entity8 giants paid almost £ 30m more than the @entity9 is currently worth - even after becoming a @entity11 winner			1
experts at the @entity14 - based @entity13 have placed ‘ market values ’ on top players from around @entity17 based on a wide range of ‘ objective ’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position , performance data and international experience			1
they calculate that @entity1 , 24 , is worth ‘ only ’ £ 50.9m at market rates based on what a buyer should reasonably pay for him if he moved this summer			1
that is £ 29.8m less than @entity3 paid for him last summer			2
@entity53 of @entity54 represents the next most over-valued player , ‘ worth ’ £ 25.6m less than @entity54 paid for him			1
@entity2 ’s @entity41 , @entity58 ’s @entity57 , @entity60 ’s @entity59 , @entity62 ’s @entity61 and @entity2 ’s @entity40 are all in the top 10 of poor value players when considering fees paid and current worth			1
‘ the comparison between transfer fees paid by clubs to sign new players at the start or during the 2013 - 14 season and their current market value allows us to assess the best and worst recruitments from a financial perspective , ’ the report ’s authors say			0
‘ the highest “ negative gap ” was recorded for @entity1 ( minus € 37m , or £ 29.8m )			2
this finding reflects the fact that @entity3 clearly paid over the odds to convince @entity2 to release the player			2
’ out of sorts : @entity58 's @entity57 ( right ) also features on the list , coming in at @entity85 money is no object : @entity60 overpaid more than £ 10m for @entity59 , says the report the authors say that at the other extreme , the @entity51 striker @entity90 , 26 , was the best buy of last summer			1
‘ the highest positive gap between fee paid and value now was observed for @entity90 , ’ they say			0
‘ @entity96 signed him for a bargain from @entity99 thanks to the existence of a very low buy - out clause			0
‘ his current market value is eight times greater than the € 2m fee paid one year ago			0
’ they say that @entity58 ’s @entity105 is the highest value player who made a debut in 2013 - 14 who cost nothing to their current club because they were produced by the club academy			0
they rate him as worth £ 10m			0
bargain buy : @entity90 is a steal at 2m euros , says the report in control : @entity105 's value is said to be at the £ 10m mark more details can be found at @entity121			0

@entity1 is valued at £ 50.9m , according to experts at the @entity13
@entity54 's @entity53 and @entity125 of @entity3 complete the top three most over-valued *plyers*
@entity129 players @entity57 , @entity41 , @entity59 , @entity61 and @entity40 also feature
