by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 27 june 2013 the judge who cleared @entity2 of killing @entity3 has hit out at his colleagues who overturned the decision , saying they were ' violating the law '			2
@entity7 acquitted @entity8 , 26 , and her former boyfriend @entity9 , 29 , of murdering the @entity12 student in 2011 after they had initially been found guilty and sentenced to 26 and 25 years jail respectively			1
however , three months ago the @entity16 @entity15 overruled that decision , saying that key evidence had been overlooked , and a fresh trial is expected to begin in the autumn			1
cleared : @entity2 , left , was acquitted of killing her flatmate @entity21 , right , in @entity22 judge : @entity7 , who overturned @entity8 's sentence , has criticised the @entity16 @entity15 for ordering the @entity25 to undergo a fresh murder trial in a furious attack mr @entity7 , who has now retired as a judge , slammed the ruling in an interview with glossy @entity16 weekly @entity31			1
' the @entity15 judges in effect carried out a straight - legged tackle , ' he said			1
they can not do that and they should not have done that			0
they should have just limited themselves to the law			0
' instead they decided to interpret the evidence and that is a violation of the law			0
what they have done is in effect hand the new trial a sentence that is ready and done - their ruling has explained to the judges in the new trial how they should convict the two accused			1
' in their ruling , the @entity15 reverted to the original 2009 trial verdict that said @entity3 had been killed by more than one person in a ' sex game gone wrong ' , claiming the acquittal two years later contained ' deficiencies , contradictions and illogical ' conclusions			1
relief : @entity8 after her acquittal in 2011 ; she now faces a retrial but is unlikely to return to the court in @entity16 @entity68 drifter @entity21 was convicted of the murder and sexual assault of @entity3 in 2009 and is now serving a 16 - year sentence , reduced from 30 on appeal			1
he could be freed as early as 2014			0
mr @entity7 said : ' the theory of a sex game gone wrong does n't add up - in that small room where @entity3 was killed after a struggle and supposedly a sex game gone wrong , maybe even an orgy , there was no biological trace of @entity8 and @entity9 - it would have been impossible for them to get rid of their traces and leave that of @entity86			1
' he added that he was ' still convinced ' he had made the right decision in freeing @entity8 and @entity9 - who were pictured last week warmly embracing in @entity88 - and added : ' i am still convinced that i did my duty			2
i 'm happy because i avoided an unjust jailing			0
' @entity16 is a country that convicts where there is proof beyond all reasonable doubt			0
in this case there were only slim possibilities that they were both involved , and when you hold a trial you are not playing the lottery			0
' couple : @entity8 was jailed for two years along with her then - boyfriend @entity9 but in a press conference in @entity22 , where @entity3 was murdered in 2007 , chief prosecutor @entity104 insisted that the retrial would give fresh hope to the @entity110 - born student 's family			1
he said : ' this has become an unworthy soap opera and only @entity21 , @entity2 and @entity9 can tell us what really happened on the night of november 1 , 2007			0
the appeal court judges lost their way - they did n't take into account anything from the first trial because they wanted to confirm their innocence			2
' the @entity15 has overruled the appeal court 's decision that there had been contamination of evidence			1
the new trial will bring justice and , in the case of a conviction , a new sentence			2
it gives fresh hope to the family of the student so they can know what happened to her			0
' @entity8 is not expected to return to @entity16 voluntarily for the retrial , and the @entity25 is extremely unlikely to extradite her to @entity136			2
she recently published a memoir , entitled waiting to be @entity139 , in which she protested her innocence and described the ordeal of spending two years in an @entity16 prison , where she says she was sexually harassed by guards and fellow inmates			0
@entity9 's father @entity148 said : ' it is evident that sentences should be respected - and above all those of the @entity15			2
' however , here we find it impossible to agree because there are serious inaccuracies in the judgement and they have no idea of the evidence			0
' what judge @entity7 is saying is that the @entity15 has in effect returned a third verdict which it should not have and which is forbidden by law			1
' last week @entity9 launched an online appeal for $ 500,000 to help fund his new trial , and the total now stands at $ 10,000 .			0

@entity8 had murder conviction overturned by @entity7
but @entity15 ruled that he ignored evidence and ordered a fresh trial
@entity7 hits out and claims judges have *overstepped* their *powers*
