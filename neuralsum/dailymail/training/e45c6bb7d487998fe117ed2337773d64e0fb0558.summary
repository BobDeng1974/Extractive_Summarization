the squad , the manager explained , were to make sure it was n't them come the end of the campaign			2
' if i was excited ( about @entity5 ' reign ) , others were worried , ' @entity0 explains			1
' and no , not because of the famous envelopes that appeared during a tv documentary about the club			2
mostly , we just joked about that particular episode , but the manager ’s methods really worked for us			0
' we never did find out what was written in those envelopes			0
i ’m sure there were no names , it was just a way of motivating us ; a tactic to make sure we gave everything			0
and in truth it got forgotten pretty quickly			0
' @entity0 also writes about the first time he met @entity5 after the @entity62 's appointment at @entity3			1
making a special effort with his star man , the @entity64 boss spoke @entity67			1
@entity5 made a special effort to speak @entity67 to @entity0 the first time the pair met @entity5 addresses his squad on the @entity23 documentary being : @entity3 @entity0 ( centre ) made his debut for @entity1 against @entity74 at the weekend ' the first chat i had with him was at @entity77 [ @entity3 ’s training ground ] , just after he was confirmed as @entity3 ’s new manager			1
it was n’t a long conversation , just the typical welcome to the club stuff , but he also wanted to talk to me because there had been suggestions there was a chance of me going to @entity88			0
' @entity5 spoke to me in @entity67 and he told me to give him time , to give him a chance , and that i would like the way we were going to play			1
he said we would bring the ball out on the floor , keep possession and play attacking football			0
i remember him saying , “ it ’s not so hard to bring the ball out from the back on the floor , you know ”			0
' it is clear that the pair had a strong relationship before @entity0 's £ 75million move to @entity1 in july			2
the 27 - year - old continues to explain how @entity5 immediately got him on side with his philosophy			2
' from the start , it convinced me			0
and although the results were n’t good , i could see that we were playing better			0
@entity5 ’s philosophy was to play on the floor , keep possession of the ball and , if we lost it , to pressure to get it back			2
do n’t panic , do n’t play so fast as we had the previous season , look for the spaces at the right time			0
' but you could see a @entity67 influence in the way that @entity5 worked			1
he was interested in @entity128 , he had studied there , and what he ’d learned there was at the heart of our style of play : passing , pressuring high , quick movement , arriving into the area rather than standing there waiting for it , coming inside from wide positions			0
