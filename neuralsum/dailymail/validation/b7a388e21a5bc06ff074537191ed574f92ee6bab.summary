@entity70 , who was praised for his officiating of @entity53 ’s @entity79 defeat by @entity80 on monday , is likely to get attention for different reasons after waving away penalty appeals , to @entity85 ’s obvious fury			0
‘ @entity70 will look at that again and be very disappointed , that ’s a blatant a penalty as i ’ve seen in a long time , ’ he said			0
a beautiful cross into the box from @entity91 led to the goal in the 19th minute			0
it was expertly headed in at the far post by a stooping @entity12 , who found it far too easy to escape the attentions of @entity97			1
@entity3 had few chances and manager @entity99 lamented : ‘ it was just one of those days when we had too many underperforming			1

or perhaps it was the threat of life in the @entity155 desert that did it			0
@entity13 were close to taking a £ 6m hit selling him to @entity158 but the 26 - year - old refused the move and both parties must be glad of his stubbornness now			1
