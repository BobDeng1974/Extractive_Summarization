by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 blamed the weather for an up and down @entity5 performance as they beat @entity6 3 - 2 at @entity7			1
@entity5 edged home thanks to two @entity10 goals and a strike from @entity12 in the first half			1
but a 3 - 0 half - time lead almost disappeared as @entity6 came back at @entity16 ’s team and @entity5 were holding on at the end			1
' maybe it was the altitude			1
' all my passes fell today and that ’s not normal			2
it was probably the air			2
the ball was bobbling but we scored remarkable goals			2
' in the second half we did n’t keep the ball in possession			2
that ’s all we had to do , to keep the ball and make the opponent run and run and run			0
' it ’s very difficult for them in the hot weather but we forgot to that so we brought @entity6 back in to the match			1
i am pleased we have won but it was no good			0
' it was hovering around 30 degrees before a kick - off that took place at 2pm local time			2
@entity21 is also a mile above sea level and @entity16 clearly has issues about @entity5 agreeing to come here			1
' the club agreed it before i got here , ' he said			0
' i am not used to the hot weather			0
i was here in 1994 for the @entity60 and games were played at noon			0
it ’s not very wise			0
over the top : @entity12 added @entity5 's second with a clever lob over keeper @entity66 linking up : goalscorers @entity12 and @entity10 celebrate the latter 's second goal of the game from the penalty spot ' you have to play football at the right time			1
i ’m sorry to say that			0
there were 55,000 people to watch us but we did n’t do it because of the weather			0
' we have scored three fantastic goals and they scored one			2
their penalty at the end was not right			0
' i do n’t want to make excuses but i do n’t believe things would normally go wrong for players like @entity92 and @entity12 and @entity93			1
' difficult conditions : @entity16 belives players such as @entity92 ( left ) were affected by the weather asked about @entity10 ’s contribution , @entity16 did n’t go in to detail			1
but he said : ' we do n’t have to discuss one player			0
we will discuss the team			0
' but the pass from @entity10 to @entity12 was unbelievable			1
despite the air and the heat ! ' @entity6 ’s first goal was scored from his own half by @entity109 midfielder @entity108			1
asked if goalkeeper @entity110 was at fault , @entity16 said : ' i am almost 63 years old			1
but when the ball is in the air for four or five seconds i could run 50 yards			0

@entity5 beat @entity6 3 - 2 in the @entity116
@entity10 scored twice either side of a @entity12 goal
@entity16 did not want his side to play in @entity21 *due* to the high altitude and heat
the @entity125 believes some of his players were affected by the conditions at @entity7
he also *criticised* keeper @entity110 for his part in @entity108 's goal
