by @entity0 published : 10:21 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 18 april 2013 scientists have unlocked the mystery of how a man with uncrossed optic nerves is still able to see thanks to the incredible adaptability of the human brain			2
in most people the optic nerves have a crossroads - known as an optic chiasm - which diverts sense data so that each half of their brains processes information from either side of their visual field			2
but the 28 - year - old subject , known only as @entity20 , was born without this crossover , meaning each half of his brain is forced to process information from his whole visual field			2
uncrossed : these @entity28 scans of @entity20 and a control show how he lacks the optic chiasm which normally diverts sense data so that each half of the brain only processes information from one side of the visual field the condition , called achiasma , means all the signals from his left eye end up in his left visual cortex and all the signals from his right eye end up in his right visual cortex			1
given the disorder , @entity48 neurologist @entity47 , of the @entity49 , and colleagues wondered how his brain made sense of it			0
normally the left visual cortex deals only with the left side of visual space , while the right visual cortex deals with the right side , explained @entity63 magazine 's @entity61 blog			0
but in @entity20 's brain each half must cope with the entire visual field , twice as much space			1
in a paper published in the journal @entity71 , dr @entity47 and her colleagues reported that @entity20 's brain has adapted by overlapping the two halves of space in @entity20 's visual cortex			1
in the @entity28 scans of @entity20 's brain published in their study , four colours are used to represent the four quarters of his visual field and the parts of his brain that light up in response to them			1
the bottom and top of his visual field remain separately represented , as they would be in a normal person 's brain			0
but there is a complete overlap between areas responding to bottom - left and bottom - right , as well as top - left and top - right			0
the adaptable brain : to deal with the information there is a complete overlap between areas of @entity20 's brain responding to bottom - left and bottom - right of his visual field , as well as top - left and top - right the incredible adaptability of the human brain is further revealed by @entity20 's 20/80 score in an eye test - one quarter as good as a typical person , despite his congenital disorder			1
@entity61 remarks on the study : ' this is a fascinating case report , and vision neuroscientists will find much to ponder here			0
' still , what i ’d love to know is how does it feel to have overlapping representations of the two sides of space ? ' does everything seem to be mirrored vertically ? does gb find it easier to tell objects apart when they ’re above and below the other , compared to side - to - side ? '			0

*patient* known only as @entity20 was born with no crossover in his optic nerves , a rare congenital condition known as achiasma
scientists using @entity28 scans found @entity20 's brain has simply adapted by dealing with both sides of the visual field in the same part of the brain
