are we on the verge of a sex abuse scandal that will dwarf any of the previous outrages involving celebrities such as @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 ? it certainly seems we may be			1
almost every day brings new charges that suggest the @entity10 may have protected ministers , mps and high officials from investigation into allegations of abuse involving children going back 30 years and more			1
this is no sensationalist claim			2
yesterday , a former senior @entity20 cabinet minister , @entity19 , raised the incendiary idea that there ‘ may well have been ’ a political cover - up of sex abuse in the @entity25			1
former senior @entity20 cabinet minister , @entity19 , raised the incendiary idea that there ' may well have been ' a political cover - up of sex abuse in the @entity25			1
it comes after the disappearance of a dossier alleging high - level paedophile activity , handed in 1983 by the late @entity20 mp @entity33 to the then @entity34 , @entity35 imagine the effect on public opinion if it were shown that some law - makers had been guilty of paedophilia , and that ministers and civil servants closed ranks to save these wrongdoers from prosecution			1
it would shatter people ’s faith in our political institutions , and very possibly make the @entity12 ’ expenses scandal look like a trivial rumpus			1
of course , we do n’t yet know how much sex abuse took place , or the extent of any cover - up			1
a thorough examination of the evidence might conclude that there was little or no systemic misbehaviour			2
but we wo n’t know without a proper public inquiry			2
the government is refusing to call one			0
@entity64 and senior ministers appear to be in a kind of denial about the seriousness of the allegations			0
the education secretary , @entity70 , yesterday repeated the party line on the @entity74 ’s @entity73 programme that there should n’t be a public inquiry			2
so far the government has agreed to ask the @entity79 ’s most senior official to look into the alarming , and unexplained , disappearance of 114 secret @entity79 files on paedophile cases			1
it has also conceded a limited and brief investigation by an as yet unnamed senior lawyer into the disappearance of a dossier alleging high - level paedophile activity			1
this was handed in 1983 by the late @entity20 mp @entity33 to the then @entity34 , @entity35			2
the loss of this dossier , which reportedly included the names of @entity93 , the @entity95 mp sir @entity94 , and @entity97 ’s former parliamentary private secretary sir @entity96 — all of them now deceased — is too momentous an event to be dealt with by the kind of investigation envisaged by mr @entity64			1
moreover , only the executive summary of this report may be made public			0
compare his reaction , and that of the government , to the response to the actually incorrect allegation in july 2011 that the @entity110 had deleted the voicemails of the murdered schoolgirl @entity113 nine years earlier , thereby giving her parents ‘ false hope ’ that she was still alive			0
although there was already a police investigation underway into phone hacking , mr @entity64 lost no time in setting up a full judicial inquiry under @entity120 into the ethics of the @entity122			0
most people would probably say that alleged paedophile activity among senior politicians and officials , and the suggestion of a cover - up , are significantly more serious matters than phone hacking			1
yet on this occasion mr @entity64 takes refuge in the argument that ‘ we must n’t do anything that could prejudice or prevent proper action by the police ’			0
but almost identical considerations did n’t stop him setting up the @entity138			0
i ’m almost certain that only inertia and poor advice are inhibiting the prime minister from doing the right thing			0
the danger , though , is that his critics will say he knows things about a cover - up which he would prefer were not made public			1
the refusal of the authorities to grip the issue is also illustrated by the very limited resources which the @entity152 have devoted to @entity153 , set up in november 2012 to investigate the historic allegations of child abuse relating to mps			2
only seven detectives have been engaged on this task , and , as the @entity160 reported on saturday , sources close to @entity153 say it has been under resourced			0
by contrast , some 30 officers have been attached to @entity163 , which has successfully investigated sex abuse scandals involving deviant celebrities such as @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity166			1
in other words , more than four times as many officers have been engaged looking into the historic misdemeanours of celebrities , often going back 30 or even 40 years , as have been involved in investigating equally historic allegations against politicians			0
it comes after a @entity176 peer has been accused of 12 attacks			0
one source said the allegations were ' horrific '			0
pictured is the @entity181 at the @entity182 where the peer sits meanwhile , 200 detectives have been deployed in investigating phone hacking and bribery allegations against journalists			0
some will say that when it comes to looking into accusations in their own backyard , senior politicians are showing a good deal less enthusiasm than they did when presented with evidence of misconduct among a limited number of journalists			0
what could be more serious than the suspicion that ministers , mps and officials were involved in paedophile activities , and that concerted attempts were made — possibly including the deliberate destruction of evidence — to hush up what had happened ? and that makes it even more important , in the interests of @entity209 and good governance , that there should be a full inquiry			2
for the rumours and stories circulating on the internet and @entity216 could well exaggerate what really went on			0
@entity176 mp @entity218 , who has done more than anyone to shed light on paedophile perversion at @entity222 , most notably in the case of @entity94 , has claimed a senior @entity20 mp warned him that he was telephoned last weekend by @entity225 , wife of @entity35 , who was ‘ worried ’ @entity218 was going to ‘ target ’ her husband at a @entity230 meeting last tuesday			1
in the event he did n’t , but the mention of @entity225 ’s call , coupled with reports that @entity35 was recently questioned by police over claims that he raped a 19 - year - old student in 1967 , will only fuel further wild speculation and theorising			2
yet it is perfectly possible that @entity35 is innocent of all and any wrong - doing , and that he fulfilled his duties admirably when handed that dossier by @entity33			1
we should n’t forget the case of @entity246			0
in late 2012 , he was wrongly fingered as a paedophile by @entity250 ’s @entity249 , and convicted by @entity251 , though he was absolutely innocent			2
some of his friends believe the stress of these false allegations hastened his death earlier this year			0
whether there was sex abuse and a cover - up among lawmakers on a huge scale , or whether such transgressions were far more limited , can be resolved only by the kind of public inquiry that @entity64 is stubbornly — and damagingly — resisting .			1

@entity19 said there may have been political cover - up of sex abuse in *80s*
comes after disappearance of 114 @entity79 files on paedophile cases
the dossier reportedly included names of @entity93 , @entity95 mp sir @entity94 , and former parliamentary private secretary sir @entity96
