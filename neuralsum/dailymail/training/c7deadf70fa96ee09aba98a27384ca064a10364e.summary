they usually use their keen sense of smell to find a bone or a tasty treat			0
but this talented dog can sniff out cancer – and even detected her owner ’s undiagnosed tumour			2
@entity10 , a ten - year - old @entity11 , has now been awarded a medal for her life - saving work			1
dogs have an incredible sense of smell thanks to 300million scent receptors in their noses , compared to a measly five million in the human nose			2
medical dogs are trained by sniffing samples of people already diagnosed with cancer and those of people without the disease so they can learn to tell the difference			2
@entity10 has found cancer in 551 patients , an accuracy rate of an impressive 93 per cent			1
and she discovered dr @entity26 ’s undiagnosed breast cancer – the first time she has detected the disease actually growing in someone ’s body , rather than by sniffing a sample			2
dr @entity26 , 50 , chief executive of charity @entity56 , said : ‘ @entity10 seemed to be pawing at my chest			2
‘ she bumped against my body repeatedly – i pushed her away , but she nuzzled against me again , clearly upset			0
she pushed me so hard that it bruised me			0
‘ her behaviour was totally out of character – she was normally such a happy dog ... i felt the tender area where she ’d pushed me , and over the next few days i detected the tiniest lump			0
‘ the bump was a perfectly harmless cyst			0
but further in the breast tissue was a deep - seated cancer			0

@entity10 , right , was able to detect the undiagnosed cancer in her owner dr @entity26 , left as it was caught so early , the lump was removed before the cancer had time to spread			1

‘ my own pet labrador saved my life			0
’ animal rescue charity @entity76 presented @entity10 , of @entity77 , @entity78 , with a medal for her achievements			1
she faced tough competition , including @entity82 , a bomb detection dog who has saved soldiers ’ lives in @entity86			1
@entity87 , the charity ’s deputy chief executive , said : ‘ all the judges on the medal panel were really touched by @entity10 ’s remarkable story and the incredible difference she has made			1
‘ @entity93 affects the lives of thousands of people and @entity10 has made a huge contribution to the diagnosis and early treatment of cancers – she ’s a very deserving medal recipient			1
