by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 11:48 est , 6 november 2012 these breathtaking pictures show the magnificent @entity2 appearing like a beacon above a glittering landscape in the early morning light			0
the view over the @entity7 was truly remarkable , as much of the @entity8 awoke to frost covering the ground and temperatures well below freezing			1
only a few dog walkers were visible outdoors as the sun rose on a bitterly cold day , bracing themselves against what is one of the coldest starts to november in years for many towns			0
revellers at @entity22 parties last night wrapped themselves in coats and scarves in the biting cold to watch fireworks sparkle in the chill night air			1
families shivered as their breath turned to vapour on a freezing evening , with temperatures reaching a low of -4.6c in @entity32 last night and dipping below zero in many areas			2
colours of day : @entity35 and trails of clouds adorn the sky - but it is a long way from the summery spells of just a few weeks ago splendid view : mist gathers at the foot of the magnificent @entity2 in the weak morning light ice blast : much of the @entity8 rose to a crust of frost today , after snow descended on @entity8 over the weekend @entity48 is coming : with @entity22 over and the weather growing bitterly cold , attention is turning to the festive season soft focus : mist lingers in fields viewed from @entity2 as the sun rises over the @entity7 countryside picture postcard : parts of the @entity8 have experienced one of the coldest starts to november for years wrap up warm : forecasters have said this looks set to be a colder winter than average solitary moment : another dog walker takes advantage of the peace and quiet on the @entity7 as others stay huddled in bed as long as possible households suffering in the biting weather will , for once , be grateful for cloud , which is now moving in from the north			1
the cloud looks set to move down across the country through the week , bringing slightly warmer temperatures and patchy rain , until temperatures dip again for the weekend			1
with winter creeping in , the vibrant sight of a @entity79 on the wall of @entity81 has vanished for another year - leaving the historic @entity81 lit only by the bright minds of @entity84 's students			1
just weeks ago , this beautiful scarlet and gold creeper dazzled in the historic grounds of @entity84			1
now the wall of @entity81 is stark and bare , as winter tightens its icy grip on @entity8 and frost covers the ground			2
a man for all seasons : @entity84 philosophy student , @entity93 , 20 , reading in the window of his dorm surrounded by a mature @entity96 on october 11 , left , and november 6 , right dramatic change : in the four weeks between the two pictures , the scarlet and gold creeper at @entity81 , @entity81 , has wilted from view @entity102 and bright : a dog walker crosses a brilliant white field in frozen @entity105 , @entity106 first rays : a photographer captures frosty scenes as the morning light bathes @entity110 , @entity106 , left , while a man takes in the gorgeous scenes with his dog , right beautiful south : early morning mist surrounds @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity7 , after the cold and frosty night breathtaking : @entity118 can be seen floating calmly on a shimmering lake in the glow of sunrise crystallised country : the leaves of a once - flourishing plant look brittle in the frost in a @entity110 field fortunately , the dedicated students seem to be sticking to their studies in spite of the frosty weather , as proved by undergraduate @entity93 , 20 , pictured reading in his window			1
the @entity133 was seen still sat in the same position as a month ago , leafing through a book on the windowsill of his student halls			0
meanwhile , millions of starlings flocked to @entity140 as mainland @entity141 grew colder , gathering in the soft pink skies over @entity143 at dusk last night			1
the birds put on a mesmerising performance as they wheeled and swooped , silouhetted in the cool evening air			0
their population in @entity140 swells to three million in november , when they fly in from @entity141 to roost , creating a magical spectacle known as a ‘ murmuration ’			1
@entity154 's tail : a mother and her foal seek out patches of grass in their frost - covered field in @entity160 , near @entity161 , this morning comfort food : ponies try to warm up with some breakfast as @entity8 braces itself against the chill best blanket : temperatures are set to heat up a fraction as cloud moves down to cover the country @entity172 almanac : the @entity173 is just visible through autumn leaves in central @entity175 @entity176 , of the @entity177 in @entity178 and @entity140 , said : ' during the day the birds go out to feed , then they all come back to roost in the evening			1
they feel a lot safer roosting together			0
' the starlings base their movements on the birds around them and so this is why you do not see them bump into each other			0
' the birds form a cloud in the sky , and appear to move as though they were a single being			2
' the starlings will stay until february before flying back to continental @entity141 for the spring and summer			1
@entity195 of the @entity196 said today : ' the lowest temperature last night was @entity198 in @entity199 , @entity32 , with @entity200 experiencing -41.c			0
near @entity203 we had -3.5c			0
spirits in the sky : starlings fill the air at dusk above @entity210 in the @entity212 border town of @entity143 mass gathering : the beautiful ' murmuration ' impresses tourists and locals every year at winter after their summer migration in warmer climes light as a feather : the birds perform dazzling displays above their rooftops before going to roost just after sunset safety in numbers : they flock together to protect themselves from predators @entity230 storm : in winter , the @entity212 population of starlings swells to two or three million single being : starlings base their movements on the birds around them so they do not bump into each other ' we now have some cloud and rain moving in across northern parts and the cloud will move south over the rest of @entity243			1
' this means temperatures will rise a little , and it will be cloudy with a bit of brightness and the odd spot of rain - though not a huge amount			2
' temperatures will return to a normal 10 - 12c during the day			2
at the weekend , the frost will be back again with this chilly autumn weather back on friday			2
