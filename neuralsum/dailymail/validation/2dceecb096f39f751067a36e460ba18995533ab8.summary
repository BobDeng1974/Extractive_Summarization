the @entity2 minister had insisted he had not had a second job since being elected mp for @entity32 in may 2005 , but was later forced to admit he had ' screwed up ' by denying the allegations ' over firmly '			0

pictured in his sports car he wrote : ' that 's me ... and i 'm sitting in my brandspanking - new @entity64 ' but he warned punters they would have to move fast because he had taken the ' difficult decision ' to limit supply to just 250 copies , saying : ' i will delete the webpage and the mastercopy of this toolkit '			2
mr @entity1 offered his online kit to people throughout the @entity75 and across the world from his @entity59 business based in @entity78			1
he wrote : ' since owning an online business has enabled me to live in a $ 2m home ... to drive 3 high - end luxury cars and to own and operate my own aircraft , i suppose a toolkit that exposes every secret used to build that kind of wealth should rightfully sell for say $ 100,000			1
