@entity0 , @entity1 editor and @entity3 supporter , assesses the rise - and - rise of the @entity6 club , third in the @entity8 table , after seven games			1
i admit it , if i look back to the state @entity3 were in over the summer , i was desperate			1
@entity13 had quit , @entity14 was gone already , @entity15 was following @entity16 , @entity17 was practically out of the door and @entity19 was at the centre of a transfer tug - of - war			1
‘ where was the message of hope and stability from the board ? ’ i cried			2
the previous season where the side had finished eight playing glorious passing football had finished full of optimism			2
the new one would start full of dread			0
many thought as i did , others pleaded for calm - though quite what shred of hope they were clinging on to other than blind footballing loyalty was beyond me			1
so it ’s barely credible that 60 days later @entity3 are sitting third in the table and to top it all striker @entity34 has been handed the player of the month award and @entity32 is manager of the month			1
if ever there was a moment things should fall apart , this is probably it ! per game @entity3 have conceded fewer goals , made more tackles and more crosses than any other team in the league			2
only @entity64 have had fewer shots against them			0
saints run of games has helped			0
@entity68 on the opening day was followed by @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity38 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
@entity74 is mobbed by team - mates after scoring at @entity38			0
the @entity3 are third in the league table @entity19 wanted to leave in the summer , but his decision to stay was monumental for the club the only black mark was the disappointing capitulation at @entity81			1
@entity32 ’s appointment was a masterstroke			2
people talk of ‘ the @entity85 ’ – a focus on developing youngsters and playing attractive football			0
but he ’s added a self - belief , possibly passed on from his own legendary reputation as a player , which has given the team more grit than last year			1
alongside him has been the addition of some excellent players , particularly the @entity98 @entity97			0
i ’m delighted for @entity34 – his match - winning overhead kick against @entity73 was the kind of spectacular finish that has been a rarity on the south coast since @entity105 retired			0
@entity106 praises @entity34 impact @entity32 has added a self - belief likely to passed on from his own legendary reputation as a player but it ’s the more defensive players that deserve much of the praise , not least @entity19			1
his decision to stay was monumental , if a little controversial			1
he was the heart of the team last year , and has proved the right person to build the new look side around			0
competition for places has helped , too			0
@entity19 , @entity121 ( who i remain convinced is the most - underrated player in the country ) , @entity74 , @entity126 and , when fit , @entity127 are battling it out for limited midfield places			1
@entity130 has developed into the player @entity3 fans knew he would , scoring goals and forcing himself in to the @entity135 squad			1
and they ’re saying it quietly down at @entity138 ’s , but things could get even better			2
new signing @entity140 seems a bit of a maverick , but one with bags of potential still to be seen			0
there is more to come from centre back @entity147 , and it barely seems possible that all this has been achieved without @entity151 , who will be like having a new signing when he returns from a long injury lay - off			2
the real test of what kind of season will be what happens at the end of november when over nine games @entity3 face @entity160 and @entity64 twice , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			1
everything is rosy on the south coast – if only we ’d beaten @entity13 ’s @entity169 side a fortnight ago , things would have seemed very sweet indeed !			0

@entity3 fans had little hope at the start of the season
it ***'s*** barely credible that @entity3 are now third in the @entity8
@entity32 has given players at @entity138 ***'s*** more self - belief
@entity19 ***'s*** decision to stay at @entity3 was ' monumental '
