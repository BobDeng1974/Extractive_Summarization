by @entity0 published : 08:26 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 12:16 est , 20 may 2013 a @entity2 space capsule carrying animals including mice , lizards , newts and gerbils has landed back on @entity8 after spending a month in space			1
the animals were subjected to various tests , during and after the trip , so @entity2 scientists could test the effects weightlessness had on their skeletons , nervous systems , muscles and hearts			1
the @entity19 carrying the animals made the successful landing in the @entity22 , about 745 miles southeast of @entity23 , but all the gerbils died , as did the majority of the mice and newts			1
the capsule was designed to support its living cargo for up to six months but only spent 30 days in space			1
the capsule 's orbit reached heights of 345 miles above @entity8 during its mission among the animals on board the @entity19 were 45 mice , left , and 15 geckos , right			1
the animals were sent into space so @entity2 scientists could test the effect weightlessness had on their skeletons , nervous systems , muscles and hearts			1
only a handful of the animals survived the month - long trip the @entity59 craft is a research capsule designed to support passengers for up to six months			1
it was launched from the @entity63 in @entity64 on 19 april			0
it was carrying 45 mice , 15 geckos , eight gerbils , snails , fish and micro-organisms			2
the @entity59 capsule uses solar cell panels as its power source			0
more than 70 physiological , morphological , genetic and molecular - biological experiments were carried out on the animals when they landed			2
@entity2 scientists wanted to test the effect weightlessness had on the animals ' bodies			1
the capsule landed on 19 may in the @entity22 - 745 miles southeast of @entity23			0
the capsule was launched into space attached to a @entity37 2 - @entity36 rocket			0
it was launched from the @entity63 in @entity64 on 19 april			0
the capsule was carrying 45 mice , 15 geckos , eight gerbils , snails , fish and plants			1
more than 70 tests were carried out on the animals during the trip and when they landed			2
the capsule reached heights of 345 miles above @entity8 during its mission			2
after landing , the animals were sent to @entity23 so scientists could carry out further tests			2
the scientists wanted to test the effect weightlessness had on the animals ' bodies			1
the mission is part of larger @entity2 initiative to determine the effects space travel has on living beings			2
the @entity37 2 - @entity36 rocket takes off from the @entity63 in @entity64 on 19 april			0
the rocket launched the @entity19 carrying the animals into a 375 - mile circular orbit at 64.9 degree inclination a @entity113 study recently employed 12 ' pillownauts ' to lie at a six - degree angle to mimic the effects weightlessness has on the body @entity2 is said to be working on a manned mission to @entity119 , and is planning to use the results from this flight to help with this			1
they plan to create a base on the @entity125 for flights to the @entity127 by 2030			0
@entity128 from the @entity129 and biological research said the @entity132 flight was the first time animals had been put in space for such a long period of time			0
@entity2 scientists involved in the mission said it was not possible to carry out the tests on astronauts who are currently working on the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) because of logistical and health reasons			0
additionally , the animals could n't be put on board the @entity141 with the astronauts because they may have posed a serious health risk			0
last month a group of 12 ' pillownauts ' took part in a scientific bed study in @entity113 , during which they spent a total of nine weeks lying at a six - degree angle below the horizontal			0
lying at this precise angle has the same affect on the human body as flying in weightlessness			0
scientists at the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity113 , in collaboration with @entity113 â€™s @entity162 space agency , were testing the physical effects weightlessness can have on astronauts during long spaceflights			1
during the study , tissue samples were taken from the pillownauts and their diet was strictly controlled .			0

the plants and animals , which also included gerbils and newts , had been orbiting the @entity8 in a @entity19 for 30 days
trip was designed to test the effects of weightlessness on the animals ' skeletons , nervous systems , muscles and hearts
