here ’s something you will never hear : @entity3 manager @entity2 saying anything which might be misconstrued as negative about his captain @entity5			1
these two are inseparable , - they ’ve served each other very well in their careers			0
but on saturday they ganged up together like the school bullies			0
i do n’t think these two realise the damage they ’ve potentially done			0
@entity5 ( right ) reacts after his goal is disallowed for offside at @entity15 on saturday @entity3 manager @entity2 ( right ) shouts instructions to his players during the 2 - 1 defeat i was at @entity19 on saturday and i could see how frustrated @entity5 was when his late goal was ruled out for offside			1
this is a @entity23 fan scoring an equaliser at @entity15 remember – that flag must have sliced right through @entity5 ’s heart			1
but that does n’t give him or @entity2 the right to then behave like social media trolls , encouraging at best ridicule and at worst venom from the @entity3 fans towards officials			1
@entity2 said the official ' dropped a massive bo * * ock '			2
for a start , that is no way for the manager of a great club like @entity3 to be speaking in a post-match press conference			0
secondly , the linesman ’s decision was correct , so if a bo * * ock was dropped , it was @entity2 who dropped it			1
@entity5 puts the ball into the net at @entity19 but the goal is disallowed for offside assistant referee @entity52 raises his flag and rules out @entity5 's second - half goal for offside @entity5 said the linesman ' gambled '			1
that ’s a hell of an accusation – and i would dare to suggest @entity5 will be a lucky man if the official decides not to seek an apology for such a slur on his professionalism			0
@entity5 then dropped his own ' bo * * ock ' by saying that the official ' ca n’t have seen it , because if he had seen it he would n’t have given offside '			2
it ’s a worry that a @entity70 manager and a @entity70 captain do not know the laws of the game of football			2
and it ’s a disgrace when the pair of them team up like a pair of sneaky ill - informed grasses to ridicule an official , and accuse him of guessing at decisions			0
@entity2 ( right ) shakes hands with @entity15 manager @entity83 before the match @entity2 scoffed at the decision , saying if @entity5 ’s head was offside then the linesman must be ' superhuman ' with ' x-ray vision '			1
no @entity2 , it was just someone doing his job brilliantly			0
you should watch and learn .			0
