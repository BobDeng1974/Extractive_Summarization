@entity16 , 17 , from @entity14 , @entity12 , was found dead weeks after representing @entity5 in sailing an inquest following her death found that the medal - winning sailor and straight - a student had been taking @entity23 , a hormone treatment for acne , before she died			1
one of the drug 's listed side - effects is depression			1
the teenager 's family have since asked their daughter 's gp to ' yellow flag ' the drug to highlight it for further research into the ' well - documented ' side effects of depression			1
the inquest heard she had left a handwritten note in her bedroom saying ' i am sorry , i love you with all my heart @entity44 '			0
when she was found it was discovered she had been listening to music			2
her rucksack contained a half empty bottle of gin and a bottle of alcohol although toxicology tests showed a low alcohol level in her blood which made it uncertain whether she had been been drinking			0
@entity4 had spent her 17th birthday with friends on a boat and had uploaded a picture of herself smiling on the day she died			1
this has now been ' liked ' by dozens of people			0
she had recently won a gold medal at the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) @entity65 in @entity66 and @entity67 , @entity68			0
friends said she had been happy and had been talking about her future before she died , and was a popular girl the inquest at @entity73 , attended by @entity4 's grandparents , heard she was a happy girl who had been successful both in sailing as well as in her studies and she hoped to go to university to study science			1

' mr @entity79 also raised his concerns about @entity23			0
the statement added : ' @entity16 was taking @entity23 that was prescribed to her four months earlier			2
from research it appears serious concerns have been raised about the serious and well - documented side - effect of depression			1
' the family have asked that this drug is yellow - flagged as a result			1
' this means the drug will be highlighted for research into the possible side effects of the drug			2
@entity23 is a contraceptive pill that is often prescribed to women to treat acne it is banned in some parts of @entity113 and has been linked to the death of seven @entity116 women six of the deaths were attributed to blood clots and one to a fall @entity23 is prescribed to more than 62,000 @entity116 women a year , usually for polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity122 ) in @entity5 there have been more than 80 reports of women suffering side effects such as hair loss and depression after taking it last year @entity130 suspended use of the pill while @entity133 investigated its side effects @entity135 died from deep vein thrombosis			1
the coroner said @entity23 was a contributory factor @entity23 , also known as @entity23 , is banned in @entity139 and @entity140 , and under review in @entity142 in 2013 doctors said they suspected the drug was linked to the stroke suffered by @entity146 when she was just 29 @entity23 is a combination of two drugs - cyproterone ( a form of the female hormone progesterone ) and ethinylestradiol ( an oestrogen ) it has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives , however the risk is still small @entity135 , 17 , from @entity158 , near @entity159 , @entity160 , died in march 2010 of a deep - vein thrombosis after taking @entity23 for acne			1
the coroner said it was the largest clot he had ever seen in someone so young and that the drug had been a contributory factor in the teenager 's death the @entity171 family has launched a petition to ban the drug on her birthday @entity4 took her boat out to the @entity176 where she had a picnic with three friends and her family before going to a pizza restaurant in the evening in @entity14			1
friend and sailing companion @entity181 said in her statement that she had no idea why @entity4 took her own life			2
she said : ' @entity16 was a popular girl , at the sailing club she had a lot of friends			0
she was also very clever			0
' miss @entity181 , who was staying with @entity4 on the day of her death , described how she had formed her first relationship with a boy while in @entity8 and had appeared upset that he had not contacted her during her birthday			1
she said : ' @entity16 was happy and she said she had her three best friends with her			0
i could tell she was disappointed she had n't heard from the boy and she kept checking her phone but she was still happy			0
' the teenager said she had been unable to answer why her friend would have wanted to take her own life , and said she had been happy and had previously talked about the future			2
she added : ' although she was sad she had n't heard from her boyfriend the night before , she knew it was n't serious because he lived abroad			0
' @entity203 , coroner for @entity12 , recorded a verdict that @entity4 took her own life and said that he could not establish a link between the acne drug and her actions			1
he said : ' i know the family is concerned about the drug dianette			2
i have considered whether @entity16 was affected by that and whether or not it caused her to be depressed			0
' i accept that there are reports of people taking the drug who have complained of depression and the leaflets issued by the manufacturers do give information about that			1
' however , @entity4 had been prescribed @entity23 for over six months and had apparently been taking that without any indication of depressions and none of her friends or family seem to have noticed she had suffered from depression			1
' i therefore can not find a link between the drug and her action to end her life			2
' @entity4 had been taking @entity23 for four months before she killed herself , the drug has depression as a side effect			1
however the coroner said he could not find a link between @entity4 's suicide and her taking it @entity4 was a straight a student and hoped to go to @entity239 and her father said sailing was ' sport of her life ' he added : ' i can not establish what was in her mind , i can well understand her parents have been racking their brains to understand as well			1
' however i think we should n't underestimate the pressures on teenagers , particularly high achievers like @entity16 and the sad part is that she felt unable to share these worries with her family and indeed her friends before she reached the decision to hang herself and it 's a tragedy for all concerned , for the sailing community , her friends but most importantly her family			0
' @entity4 , a student at @entity259 in the @entity11 , learned to sail in 2009 before becoming a member of @entity261			1
