by @entity0 published : 21:34 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 21:35 est , 14 august 2013 a @entity2 couple that wants to adopt a young @entity5 girl took their fight to @entity8 on wednesday , hoping to visit the child who previously lived with them for 27 months and seeking a compromise with her biological family that would return @entity13 to their home			1
@entity16 and @entity17 believe they have done everything necessary to regain custody of the girl , who is about to turn 4			1
the @entity23 @entity22 said in june that provisions of the @entity25 , which would favor the girl 's father , did n't apply in the case , and a @entity2 court awarded the couple custody on july 31			1
the ongoing dispute has raised questions about jurisdictions , tribal sovereignty and the federal law meant to help keep native american tribes together			0
compromise : @entity16 and @entity17 are willing to make a deal to get their adopted daughter back ' we made the trip to @entity8 to get our daughter , ' @entity41 said at a news conference in downtown @entity46 on wednesday			1
' @entity13 will be coming home , but if there is going to be some thoughtful solution that continues to involve all who love her , then this is the time			2
' the girl , under a @entity55 court order , has been with the family of @entity57 , her biological father			1
the tribe 's chief urged patience			0
' the @entity62 have requested the @entity55 and @entity57 to follow the @entity2 court 's order , but they forget that @entity57 has the same rights to have his arguments heard before our @entity8 courts and @entity69 , ' chief @entity61 said			1
' the cherokee people throughout time have stood our ground and for the rights of our people , and this is no different			0
we will continue to stand by @entity57 and his biological daughter , @entity13 , and for what is right			2
' @entity8 gov. @entity78 urged the families to get together and talk - even threatening @entity57 with extradition to @entity2 on a charge of custodial interference if he was ' unwilling to cooperate			1
' in a statement distributed later wednesday , @entity57 's lawyers said an @entity8 court should determine what 's best for the child			1
@entity57 , shows @entity57 with his daughter , @entity13 , says he was n't consulted when the girl 's mother put her up for adoption ' the @entity2 court 's determination of this issue was based upon facts as they existed almost two years ago			1
we are fully in favor of a present day determination of @entity13 's best interest to be made by a court in the state where @entity13 has lived for the past 19 months , ' lawyers @entity96 and @entity98 wrote			2
they said they would contact the @entity62 lawyer to see if the families could reach a quick resolution			0
@entity13 was born in late 2009			0
@entity57 initially did not press his parental rights - the girl 's mother is not @entity112 - but when he discovered @entity13 was going to be adopted , he objected and said the @entity25 favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions			1
the @entity62 and their supporters said wednesday a compromise is in order			0
' we do n't seek victory			0
what we seek is peace for our daughter , ' @entity17 said			0
@entity123 , a family representative , said he was willing to meet with @entity57 to discuss arrangements			0
only one side has been deemed the rightful parents , ' @entity123 said at the family 's news conference			0
' possession is not nine - tenths of the law			0
' extradition : @entity2 governor @entity133 is seeking @entity57 's extradition after he was charged with custodial interference a handful of protesters shouted ' keep @entity13 home ' and ' you 're trying to break laws in @entity8 ' at the @entity62 as they emerged from a hotel after meeting with reporters			1
some held signs reading ' keep @entity145 ' and others that were written in the @entity5 language			0
under the @entity25 , the @entity55 has a vested interest in the child and , if invoked at the right time , the law allows the tribe to take over the adoption proceedings			0
in june , the @entity23 @entity22 ruled that @entity2 courts should decide who gets to adopt @entity13 , rejecting earlier decisions in @entity2 that said the federal @entity25 favored her father			1
@entity2 gov. @entity133 has written to @entity8 gov. @entity78 seeking @entity57 's extradition after he was charged with custodial interference after missing a court hearing this month			1
@entity78 initially said she would consider the warrant next month , after @entity57 's expected @entity8 court appearance , but on wednesday she tried to use the extradition papers as leverage in an effort to get the families talking			1
a first step would appear to be setting up a meeting between the @entity62 and @entity13			0
' mr. and mrs. @entity17 deserve an opportunity to meet with their adopted daughter			2
they also deserve the chance to meet with mr. @entity57 and put an end to this conflict , ' @entity78 said			0
pressure : @entity8 governor @entity78 is urging the two families to work it out , but threatened to extradite @entity57 the @entity8 governor urged a quick resolution and said , ' if mr. @entity57 is unwilling to cooperate with these reasonable expectations , then i will be forced to expedite his extradition request and let the issue be settled in court			1
' @entity78 did not set a deadline			0
the @entity62 said they did n't know how long they planned to stay in @entity8			2
in @entity186 , @entity2 , a family court judge on wednesday listened to an argument from @entity57 's attorney asking him to reconsider aspects of the order requiring his client to turn over the child to the @entity62			1
attorney @entity193 credited @entity78 on her call for the meeting between the two sides , saying neither @entity57 nor the @entity62 will be happy if the case lands in court			2
' that 's all we have requested from day one in this case , that the courts engage in reflection and deliberation before they act , ' @entity199 said after the two - hour hearing			2
@entity123 said he would meet with @entity57 anywhere , anytime to develop a plan to raise the child			0
' there is but one solution which takes @entity13 's short - term and long - term needs into account : compromise , ' @entity123 said .			2

the @entity23 @entity22 said in june that provisions of the @entity25 , which would favor the girl 's biological father , did n't apply in the case , and a @entity2 court awarded the couple , @entity16 and @entity17 , custody on july 31
the girl 's biological father , @entity57 , initially did not press his parental rights for 3 - year - old @entity13 - the girl 's mother is not @entity112 - but when he discovered @entity13 was going to be adopted , he objected and said the @entity25 favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions
the governors of both @entity8 and @entity2 have publicly urged the families to come to some sort of understanding or @entity57 will be extradited to @entity2
