by @entity1 reporter published : 20:08 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 11 july 2013 survivors of @entity3 have made an emotional pilgrimage to the site of the crash , which killed two @entity8 schoolgirls on saturday			1
a group of passengers from the flight , which lost its tail in the fatal landing in @entity14 , were taken to the runway to see the wreckage on wednesday			1
three buses carried survivors to the @entity19 , which is still in the spot where it came to rest after hitting the seawall and catching fire as it skidded across the runway			0
in the moments after flight 214 crash landed in @entity14 on saturday , passengers were told to remain in their seats while the crew contacted the control tower			1
it was not until 90 seconds later that the plane was evacuated after a fire was spotted , according to the @entity46			1
at that point , the doors were opened and the escape slides were inflated as passengers fled the plane , which clipped a seawall and snapped off its tail as it landed on saturday			1
site visit : the @entity56 passengers are taken away from the airport on a bus after visiting the crash scene evacuation : passengers flee from the burning wreckage of @entity3 after it crash landed in @entity14 two flight attendants were trapped by slides , which had inflated inside the aircraft during the crash			1
as more details about the aftermath of the crash emerge , the @entity46 has said that the pilot who was making his first landing in a @entity19 at that airport reported being blinded by a light at about 500ft			1
which was 34 seconds before the impact			0
it was also the first time that @entity79 , a 46 - year - old pilot with 35 hours ' experience flying a @entity19 777 , had been paired with his trainer @entity81 - @entity82 although the men had years of aviation experience , the flight on saturday involved unfamiliar duties , and it was the first time they had flown together			1
@entity46 chairman @entity87 said the pilot told investigators he was blinded by a light at the point when the aircraft began to slow and drop			1
she said lasers have not been ruled out , and it was unclear if the flash might have played a role in the crash			1
injured : a member of the cabin crew is pushed through @entity14 airport			0
three flight attendants are still in hospital crew : cabin manager @entity104 and other flight attendants from @entity3 at a press conference today experts say investigators trying to piece together what went wrong will consider the report about the light and many other factors , including the pairing of the pilots , who were assigned to work together through a tightly regulated system developed after several deadly crashes in the 1980s			1
the @entity46 ' is definitely going to focus on what type of policy @entity56 had in terms of crew pairing , ' former @entity46 chairman @entity117 said			1
' that 's what the airline needs to do , be responsible so that in the cockpit you 're matching the best people , especially when you 're introducing someone to a new aircraft			1
' pilots are typically paired by management and are not allowed to choose their partners in the cockpit			1
@entity134 aeronautics professor @entity133 said it was common for two commercial pilots to be assigned to the same flight without working together before			1
airlines have standardized , formal procedures to help teams who have not worked together before			0
' research would tell you that crew pairing with the same people over longer periods of time is safer , ' she said			1
' when two people fly together all the time , you get into a routine that 's more efficient			2
' @entity153 , a @entity155 first officer , said that with the right training it should not matter if a pilot new to a plane is paired with a pilot making his first trip as a training captain			0
wreckage : a fire that started near the front of the plane quickly spread ' everybody had to have their first time , ' mr @entity165 said			0
' you ca n't show up and have 500 hours experience in aircraft			0
' mr @entity165 was the co-pilot of the jet that was landed on the @entity173 by captain @entity174 , after it lost thrust in both engines after colliding with geese			0
the skillful flying of @entity179 and teamwork between him and mr @entity165 was credited for a near - perfect water landing on the @entity173 in @entity182 that saved the lives of everyone on board			2
the january 2009 accident happened after the pilots had been paired together only four days before			2
details emerging from pilot interviews , cockpit recorders and control - tower communications indicate that @entity79 , who was halfway through his certification training for the @entity19 , and his co-pilot and instructor , @entity195 , thought the aircraft 's speed was being controlled by an autothrottle			2
teamwork : captain @entity179 and copilot @entity153 had only been flying together for a short time when they successfully crash landed on the @entity173 fortunate : captain @entity174 stands next to the passenger plane he landed on the @entity173 without killing anyone on board inspectors found that the autothrottle had been ' armed ' , or made ready for activation , ms @entity87 said			2
however , it has not yet been determined if it had been engaged			0
when the pilots realized the plane was approaching the waterfront runway too low and slow , they both reached for the throttle			2
passengers heard a roar as the plane revved in a last - minute attempt to abort the landing			2
the two pilots at the controls during the accident had also been in the cockpit for takeoff			2
they then rested during the flight while a second pair of pilots took over			1
the two pairs swapped again about 90 minutes before landing , giving the trainee a chance to fly during the more challenging approach phase			2
the investigation is ongoing , and ms @entity87 cautioned against speculating about the cause of the crash			2
she stressed that even if the autothrottle malfunctioned , the pilots were ultimately responsible for control of the airliner			2
investigation : @entity46 crash experts examine the wreckage of @entity3 which crashed on saturday ' let me be very clear : the crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft , ' she said on tuesday			1
airspeed is ' one of the very critical things that needs to be monitored on the approach to landing ' , she added			0
' so we need to understand what was going on in the cockpit and on the aircraft			0
' a third pilot who was in the cockpit jumpseat to monitor the landing told investigators he could not see the approach because the tail was so low the aircraft 's angle had blocked his view of the ground			0
the tail ultimately smashed into a seawall and broke off before the rest of the fuselage hit and ground and spun across the tarmac			0
survivor @entity271 , who was returning from a martial arts competition in @entity274 and walked away without injury , said he was not concerned about lack of experience in the cockpit			0
' everyone starts a career someway , somehow			0
starts a new plane someway , somehow			0
they have to have training , ' he said			0
the @entity285 , a union representing more than 50,000 pilots at 33 @entity288 and @entity289 airlines , has complained that the @entity46 is releasing incomplete , out - of - context information that could lead to unfair characterizations of @entity56 's pilots			1
' without the full body of facts surrounding a catastrophic event , partial or incomplete information can lead to erroneous conclusions and , in turn , skew the perception of individuals ' behavior			0
this could then lead to misguided assessments of the crew 's intentions and actions , ' the union said in a statement			0
progress : @entity46 chairman @entity87 is giving regular updates on the investigation however , ms @entity87 said the @entity46 was representing passengers and trying to be transparent			1
nearly 20 survivors remained in hospital on wednesday , and families have started arriving to be at their bed sides			1
three flight attendants who were thrown from the aircraft during the accident were among those hurt			1
one of them has been identified as 25 - year - old @entity322 , whose father has been given a visa so he can visit her			0
another flight attendant , identified as @entity326 , was reportedly in intensive care			0
fire officials have also continued their investigation into whether a fire truck may have run over one of the two teenagers killed in the crash			0
@entity334 and @entity335 were part of a larger group of students due to attend a @entity340 summer camp .			0
