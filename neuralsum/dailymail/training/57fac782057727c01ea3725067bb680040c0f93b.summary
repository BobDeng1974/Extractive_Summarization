by @entity0 @entity1 , star of comedy show @entity2 , has criticised @entity5 executives for turning middle class into a ' dirty word ' she made her name as the star of a quintessential middle class sitcom			1
so @entity1 is more than qualified to defend such shows amid claims that @entity5 bosses think there ’s too many of them			1
the @entity2 actress , now 88 , has attacked the corporation for turning ‘ middle class ’ into a ‘ dirty word ’ by concentrating too much on blue collar comedies			1
miss @entity1 , who appears in new @entity21 show boomers , said it was ‘ extraordinary ’ that bawdy comedies such as @entity24 are preferred to gentler shows such as @entity26			1
she criticised a recent @entity28 report which accused @entity21 of ‘ playing it safe ’ and found viewers from ‘ lower social grade audiences ’ considered its comedy to be too middle class			1
appearing at the launch of boomers – which follows the lives of a group of retired friends – miss @entity1 was asked whether she agreed with the @entity28 report and felt the middle class should be ‘ written off ’			1
she replied : ‘ no i do n’t			0
it ’s one of my big bugbears			0
there are so many middle class folk about the place that it ’s almost become a dirty word			1
[ when they say ] “ oh no , it ’s too middle class ” , what do they mean ? they are people			2
’ last month the @entity28 said @entity26 , starring @entity50 , was an example of the sort of sitcom audiences found too middle class ‘ in focus and target audience ’			2
it highlighted @entity24 , which stars @entity60 actor @entity59 as a foul - mouthed matriarch , as an example of a successful working - class comedy			1
but miss @entity1 said she disliked such brash and crude comedies			0
she said : ‘ it ’s quite extraordinary that everything has to be in your face			0
’ speaking at the same event , tv executive @entity71 – whose production company @entity69 made boomers – said the @entity28 ’s findings were ‘ very unhelpful ’			0
you ’d have no @entity92 , you would n’t have outnumbered			0
’ miss @entity1 found fame in the 1970s and 1980s in @entity2			0
she once supported @entity94 and @entity95 , starred in @entity96 and has made appearances in @entity99 and @entity98			0
@entity26 was narrowly beaten in the ratings by @entity24 when the shows went head to head last year			2
@entity26 averaged 7.1million viewers , just short of the 7.3million who watched @entity24 half an hour later			0
the @entity28 said its report reflected viewers ’ opinions and it did not endorse the view that @entity5 comedy was too middle class			1
