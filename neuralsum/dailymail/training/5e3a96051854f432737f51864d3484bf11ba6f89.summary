bonus : @entity2 ceo @entity1 was given £ 1m by @entity2 chiefs , despite a catalogue of failures and his decision to axe 3,500 jobs the boss of state - owned @entity2 was handed an annual bonus of nearly £ 1million yesterday			1
to widespread fury , the board of directors awarded @entity1 more than many ordinary workers earn in a lifetime			1
the bank insists it has shown restraint because its chief executive was ‘ entitled ’ to £ 1.5million			1
but @entity17 , a senior @entity18 on the treasury select committee , said : ‘ mr @entity1 is already paid a £ 1.2million basic salary , which seems to me generous given that the share price has fallen and @entity2 has failed to meet its lending targets set by the chancellor			1
‘ it is therefore totally unacceptable that there should be a bonus of just under £ 1million for what in the rest of the private sector would be seen as sub-standard performance			1
’ @entity31 , a @entity32 mp on the same committee , said : ‘ it is a reward for failure			0
giving him a bonus that just creeps under £ 1million is like sticking two fingers up at the taxpayer			1
the government should have put their foot down and insisted that he gets nothing			0
’ the move comes just days after ministers announced a crackdown on executive pay and @entity48 said a seven - figure sum for mr @entity1 would be unacceptable			1
the prime minister said rewards for failure made ‘ people ’s blood boil ’ when – in the words of the @entity58 governor – hard - up @entity55 were suffering ‘ a ferocious squeeze ’			0
mr @entity1 ’s bonus is the first of many for staff at a bank in the process of laying off 3,500 employees			1
@entity2 ’s share price , meanwhile , has slumped by 40 per cent , giving the taxpayer a paper loss of billions of pounds			2
senior government sources said they were satisfied mr @entity1 ’s bonus had been cut and insisted he had to be paid well or be lost to a better - paid job in the private sector			1
angry : @entity48 said that the rewards for failure make people 's ' blood boil ' while @entity32 's @entity31 said that the payment was like ' sticking two fingers up at the taxpayer ' one source said : ‘ we said it should be smaller than last year and we said it should be under £ 1million			1
last year , his bonus was £ 2.04million			1
a senior @entity86 source said : ‘ we said we wanted the bonus to be significantly less and they have bowed to that			2
’ sir @entity90 , chairman of @entity2 , said the bonus was fair , adding : ‘ a safer and more valuable @entity2 is in the interests of our customers , shareholders and the @entity55 economy			2
‘ we are progressing well toward this goal under the leadership of @entity1			1
’ protest : a man wearing a ' fat cat ' suit stands outside @entity2 in @entity101 , with a cigar yesterday as the bank met to decide on the bonus however , the boss of @entity106 , which is also partly nationalised , has turned down a bonus which could have been up to £ 2.4million			1
@entity108 said his decision was triggered by ‘ the tough financial circumstances that many people are facing ’ , as well as his two - month absence following a severe attack of insomnia			1
mr @entity1 ’s bonus will be paid entirely in shares , allocated over the next three years			1
he has been given 3.6million , worth a total of £ 996,000 last night			2
mr @entity1 will be taxed on his bonus , although the exact size of the tax bill is unclear because there are many different structures a company can use to make a share - based bonus award			1
last night , experts said the most likely option is that he will have to pay income tax , currently 50 per cent , when the shares are awarded to him over the next three years			2
@entity32 condemned the government ’s failure to get a better deal			0
@entity132 , shadow commons leader , said : ‘ the board of @entity2 is thinking of paying their chief executive in one day more than someone on average earnings would make in a lifetime			0
we have heard expressions of outrage from the @entity130 benches but the question is : “ what is it going to do about it ? ” @entity145 , a @entity147 peer , said : ‘ it is time to block the bonus which is a clear reward for his failure to lend			2
he should certainly not got a penny in bonus			2
@entity55 can not grow when one of its biggest banks does not lend			0
’ @entity158 , national officer at the union @entity159 , said : ‘ what planet do @entity1 and his banking chums live on ? ’ he said the bonus was ‘ utterly disgusting and offensive to every working person across the country ’			1
sir @entity165 , the @entity58 governor , has also voiced his disapproval of big bonuses at a time of financial hardship			0
in a speech this week , he said : ‘ the tragedy of the financial crisis is that those who have suffered most have been those who bear no responsibility for it			0
’ criticism : sir @entity165 said it would be wrong if rewards go to a small elite earlier this week , while @entity132 asked what the government were doing about it in a speech in the @entity184 he added it would be wrong ‘ if rewards go disproportionately to a small elite , especially one which benefited from the support of taxpayers			0
’ @entity2 ’s share price has fallen almost 40 per cent in the past 12 months to close at 27.67p last night			0
the bank fell slightly short of its target for lending to small firms under the government ’s @entity195 initiative to get credit flowing through the economy , critics argue the @entity195 goals are faulty as they measure banks ’ ‘ capacity ’ to lend – the money they make available in theory			0
small firms claim the banks have hiked up loan charges and fees , deterring businesses from taking up the funds			0
under the terms of @entity195 , @entity2 and the country ’s other four biggest banks pledged to lend small and medium - sized firms £ 76billion in 2011			0
between january and september , this should have seen them hand out £ 57billion – and they fell £ 1billion short			0
@entity145 said @entity2 , which is 83 per cent state owned following its bail - out in 2008 , was ‘ the worst culprit by far ’ among the banks			0
@entity2 earlier this month announced a further 3,500 job losses in its investment banking operation , on top of 2,000 announced @entity225 bank has shed around 30,000 staff in the past two years , 22,000 of them in the @entity55			0
@entity227 , @entity86 spokesman , said : ‘ nobody doubts that @entity1 has done some important things at @entity2 , but what this award shows is @entity48 ’s promises about reining in excessive bonuses at state - owned banks or using shareholder power have proved to be utterly worthless			2
‘ indeed , anyone who thinks it is acceptable to award a bonus of almost £ 1million on top of a basic salary of £ 1.2million in these tough times is desperately out of touch with millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet			2
’ but @entity246 , the leader of the @entity184 , said : ‘ the contract which entitles mr @entity1 to a bonus was put in place by the last @entity32 government			1
‘ we have done something which they failed to do			0
we have limited cash bonuses to £ 2,000 at @entity2 and @entity106			0
‘ we ’ve already said the bonus pool at @entity2 and @entity106 will be lower and more transparent this year than last year			0

@entity257 claims it showed ' restraint ' as @entity1 was entitled to £ 1.5m
@entity261 attack decision , with one *describing* it as like ' sticking two fingers up at the taxpayer '
bonus will be paid in shares allocated over three years
