by @entity0 @entity1 does not want to be @entity2 , a star player who carries out someone else ’s plan			1
he intends to be @entity5 , the star manager who arrives on a mission to take the team back to the top of the league			0
but the @entity10 already have a manager			1
he is called @entity12 , and he has been running the side since 2005			1
last week he sent a tweet from his holiday deckchair : ‘ great news that @entity1 plans to stand at next year ’s general election – i ’ve always said i want my star players on the pitch			1
’ @entity12 is making the best of what both for him and his party is an extremely dangerous situation			1
the @entity10 are in a concealed state of mutiny			1
many backbenchers think @entity12 is a hopeless leader , and would like nothing better than to get rid of him and his henchman , @entity28			1
the mutiny requires a leader			0
this is the significance of the return of @entity1 : he is coming aboard as the man with the dash , the subversiveness and the acute sense of timing needed to overthrow @entity12			1
@entity1 also has a growing band of sympathisers who could coalesce into something really formidable			1
the reshuffle confirmed to a large number of @entity10 @entity50 that they have nothing to hope for from the present leadership			1
i can not break confidences			0
so let me just say how moving i found it , a day or two before the reshuffle took place , to be told by a @entity10 mp of his outstanding suitability for the post of minister of state for @entity64			1
alas , the paperclips job went to a woman who always does what @entity28 tells her			1
paperclip ( as i have decided to call the mp in order to preserve his anonymity ) got on the blower to @entity1			1
and what a sympathetic hearing he received from the mayor of @entity30			0
i am happy to report that @entity64 has gone off on holiday with a spring in his step			0
for he is under the impression that @entity1 has every intention of offering him a job commensurate with his talents , as soon as the present ministerial team can be got rid of			2
@entity1 ’s enemies go around asking whether he can be trusted			2
it is a good question , but it also betrays a failure to understand what is going on			0
for in order to lead a successful uprising , you need in some respects to be untrustworthy			0
@entity1 by temperament is an outsider , a maverick			2
he can not see a red button marked ‘ @entity94 ’ without wanting to press it			0
@entity12 would rather see politics as a game of football in which everyone is obliged to obey the rules			2
but @entity10 politics over the next year or two may turn out to be more like @entity102 , with @entity12 as @entity103 and @entity1 as @entity104 , the leader of the mutineers			1
@entity1 ( pictured with @entity12 ) intends to stand as a @entity10 mp at the next election the time may not be far off when @entity12 , @entity28 and their followers are lowered over the side into an open boat , while @entity1 takes command of the ship			1
but the time for this parting of the ways has not yet come			0
@entity12 and @entity28 have the chance to achieve in 2015 the victory which eluded them in 2010			1
any conservative who disrupts the general election campaign will not be forgiven			0
@entity1 has accepted the logic of this			2
he is going to be the most loyal member of the @entity10 campaign one could hope to find			2
but his loyalty will often be so exaggerated as to amount to a form of subversion			0
as he said when asked about the @entity129 in his first newspaper interview after announcing his intention to stand : ‘ the big story is going to be @entity133			0
’ which other leading @entity10 dares call the prime minister ‘ @entity133 ’ ? and how big a story will @entity133 be when he tells us for the umpteenth time about the wonders of ‘ @entity140 ? ’ journalists condemned to cover this stuff will instead flock to see @entity1 , in the hope that he will say something more amusing			1
the critics will try to suggest that because @entity1 does not have an ideology , he is somehow unworthy to engage in politics			2
but ideology can lead to appalling blunders			0
@entity1 does not want to be @entity2 ( pictured ) - a star player who carries out someone else ’s plan			2
he intends to be @entity5 - the star manager , says @entity0 what @entity1 has is a set of powerfully conservative instincts , which he applies in the light of circumstances			2
i nevertheless believe he is a bit hurt by the claim that he has nothing much to say about policy			0
hence his assembly at @entity163 of a team who can feed him the ammunition he needs for his leadership bid			0
people such as @entity169 , who became the mayor ’s chief economic adviser			0
@entity169 supplied the research @entity1 last week used to place pressure on @entity12 to adopt a tougher negotiating position in @entity32			1
but @entity1 did not himself get bogged down in technicalities			2
he instead said of this new strategy : ‘ if you do n’t go in hard to the tackle you are never going to come out well			0
you ’ve got to go in hard and low			0
’ it is an analogy drawn from rugby , a game which @entity1 played with enthusiasm at school and university			0
when the time comes to ‘ go in hard and low ’ against @entity12 , @entity1 will undoubtedly do so			1
@entity0 is a contributing editor to @entity187 .			0

@entity1 *supporters* said to be *plotting* to install him as @entity10 leader
but @entity12 and @entity28 have the chance to achieve victory in 2015
