in a humiliating admission , secretary of state @entity0 said today that there was an explicit link between the @entity5 network in @entity6 and the deadly attacks on the @entity9 consulate in @entity10 , backtracking from what the @entity11 had said previously			1
speaking at a @entity14 meeting at the @entity15 , mrs @entity0 said an @entity17 - founded branch of the @entity5 network was situated in the area , using their location to plan and execute attacks , like the one in @entity22 on september 11			1
this goes directly against the initial statements of the @entity25 and president @entity26 , who acknowledged that the consulate attack , which killed @entity30 ambassador @entity29 and three other @entity9 , was a terrorist attack but that @entity5 ’s involvement 's was unclear			1
meanwhile , the @entity25 told reporters today that president @entity26 now believes the assault on the embassy was the work of a terrorist attack			1
‘ it is our view as an administration , the president ’s view , that it was a terrorist attack , ’ press secretary @entity52 said , according to @entity53			1
the administration had initially hinted that the violent and fiery attacks were fuelled by rage from an anti-islam film			0
mr @entity52 said that ‘ there was no reason ( the president ) chose the words he did beyond trying to provide a full explanation of his views and his assessment that we need to await further information that the investigation will uncover			2
’ this comes as @entity30 president @entity76 claimed the deadly 9/11 anniversary attack on the @entity9 @entity78 in @entity22 was undoubtedly a ' pre-planned act of terrorism			1
' the comments follow repetitive claims by the @entity9 government that the attack last month that killed ambassador @entity29 was spontaneous , and was sparked by an anti-islam film produced in @entity87			1
the @entity25 said that president @entity26 , pictured today at @entity88 in @entity89 , has now acknowledged the deadly attacks to be the work of terrorists but president @entity76 quashed the idea the assault on the consulate was prompted by the movie , adding that he has ' no doubt ' it was a premeditated act of terrorism targeting @entity9 citizens			1
' it 's a pre-planned act of terrorism , ' he told @entity104 's @entity103 , adding that the anti-islam film had ' nothing to do with this attack			2
' the @entity30 president 's remarks also come as a report in @entity111 claims @entity9 intelligence agencies knew within 24 hours that the fire fight at the @entity22 consulate building was orchestrated by @entity5 - affiliates hiding in @entity10			1
unnamed officials said they had even tracked down the location of one suspect within this time , using social media			0
in the interview with @entity104 , @entity76 said the fact the attack occurred on september 11 was hugely significant , and provided further evidence that it was orchestrated by extremists rather than spontaneous protesters			2
terrorism : @entity30 president @entity76 , speaking to @entity104 , said he had ' no doubt ' the attack on the @entity9 @entity78 was pre-planned significant : @entity76 , pictured right with @entity103 , said the fact the attack occurred on september 11 was of great significance he added that there were no protesters at the consulate before the assault , which he told the tv station came in two waves - the first involving rocket - propelled grenades on the consulate then with mortars at a safe house			1
' reaction ( to the anti-islam film ) should have been six months earlier			0
so it was postponed until the 11th of september			0
they chose this date to carry a certain message			0
' - @entity30 president @entity76 the @entity9 government initially denied that the attacks were planned , instead linking them directly to protests over the film			1
it was n't until late last week that the @entity26 administration formally acknowledged the deadly 9/11 assault was in fact a terrorist attack			2
@entity76 said the video had been available for months before the @entity22 attack and therefore was n't the catalyst			2
' reaction should have been , if it was genuine , should have been six months earlier			0
so it was postponed until the 11th of september , ' he told @entity104			0
' they chose this date , 11th of september to carry a certain message			0
' when asked by @entity103 what his evidence was that the attack was pre-planned , he said : ' @entity171 , is choosing the date , 11th of september has all the significance			2
if we take the facts about the way it was executed we can see there is enough proof that it is a pre-planned act of terrorism			0
' four @entity9 citizens died in the attack on the consulate in @entity22 , including the @entity9 ambassador @entity29 , as well as former @entity183 assault : the @entity9 @entity78 in @entity22 was burned during a protest by an armed group on the eleventh anniversary of the september 11 attacks he said it was too early for him to give the minute details of the attack but he said the perpetrators must have had experience			1
' it was launched with a high degree of accuracy which means the perpetrators must have some kind of exercise on how to hit and how to launch these acts , ' he said			0
@entity76 said he thinks that @entity5 was behind the assault but he added there was so far no direct evidence to prove that is the case			1
' as the investigation progresses that is the likelihood we will reach that , ' he said			0
according to @entity111 , @entity9 intelligence agencies knew within 24 hours that @entity5 - affiliated operatives were behind the deadly assault			1
three separate unnamed officials told the website that early information was enough to show the attack was planned and orchestrated by groups in @entity10 linked to @entity5			2
they said @entity9 intelligence agencies developed leads on four of the participants within 24 hours of the fire fight that killed @entity29 as well as information management officer @entity221 and security personnel @entity222 and @entity223			1

' another @entity9 intelligence official told the website : ' there was very good information on this in the first 24 hours			2
these guys have a return address			0
there are camps of people and a wide variety of things we could do			0
