by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity2 led @entity3 to a 6 - 0 mauling of @entity5 on friday , and the @entity7 midfielder proudly donned the captain 's armband throughout for the first time in his still - young career			1
but who is the man that won @entity15 last season as a @entity7 youngster ? here , @entity18 examines the the 19 - year - old and tell you all you need to know			1
potential : @entity2 led @entity3 to a 6 - 0 mauling of @entity5 on friday in his debut at that level @entity24 : @entity25 , april 25 1995 ( age 19 ) @entity27 : central midfielder youth career : 2004 - 2005 : @entity25 2005 - 2014 : @entity7 @entity30 : 2014 - now : @entity7 2011 - 2011 : @entity31 ( 7 , 1 ) 2013 - 2014 : @entity32 ( 14 , 9 ) 2014 - now : @entity3 ( 1 , 1 ) who is this potential @entity3 star ? @entity2 is a 19 - year - old central midfielder who , having plied his trade at @entity25 in their centre of excellence , joined @entity7 in 2005			1
scouts were quick to sign the then - 10 - year - old from the @entity25 academy , despite @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 also lurking			1
it took more than just his party trick - being able to do 600 keepie - uppies in one go - to catch their attention , though			0
his ability in the engine room , even at the tender age of nine , impressed @entity7 enough to fork out a four - figure sum more than 10 years ago			2
they 've kept tight hold ever since , seeing off interest from @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and other @entity60 clubs , who want to take him away from @entity63 on loan			1
but no @entity7 youngsters get through to the first team ... ah , but they do			2
@entity67 gifted @entity2 his senior debut in the @entity69 against @entity70 in january			1
the @entity3 hopeful came on as a late substitute for @entity73 , leaving @entity74 on the bench at @entity76 , and @entity7 comfortably won 2 - 0			2
it is n't all about the first team , though			0
@entity2 's @entity79 duties at @entity7 involve him acting as captain for others developing at the @entity83 club			1
@entity2 , on his debut at @entity3 level , captained @entity3 and scored a penalty en route to a 6 - 0 win on friday			2
with little else to do during the international break , @entity67 should take note			0
strike : @entity2 scores a penalty against @entity94 on friday as he led from the front like a true captain star in the making : @entity2 is a 19 - year - old central midfielder who plied his trade at @entity25 's centre of excellence celebration : @entity7 enough to fork out a four - figure sum more than 10 years ago to snap up @entity2 join @entity1 's @entity105 game by clicking here and start picking now ! what would i have to pay to buy him ? a pretty penny , as is the norm in football nowadays			1
@entity2 's price would likely be north of £ 5million , should you wish to bring him to your club			1
@entity116 , @entity57 and @entity58 enquired about the starlet 's status , but were unsuccessful in agreeing a loan deal with @entity7			1
untested talent can be difficult to slap a price on , of course , but @entity7 insist they have no ordinary youth product on their hands here			2
what 's his style of play ? @entity129			0
@entity2 sits in the middle , overseeing almost every pocket of space the pitch has to offer			0
he can , though , switch to the right wing and play behind the striker if need be			0
the playmaker 's ability to take a free - kick with either foot leaves goalkeepers at a loss			0
his left - footed strike against @entity143 and his right - footed goal against @entity145 are testament to his versatility			0
proud : @entity2 tweeted his pleasing message about being the captain for @entity3 at the @entity3 level click here to read the match report from @entity3 's 6 - 0 win over @entity153 but is there a chance he 'll be a regular first team player ? that 's the £ 5m ( or so ) question			2
@entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and more are all midfielders above @entity2 in the pecking order			0
he has his work cut out for him			0
a loan spell would most likely be best for @entity2 to whet his appetite in the @entity60 or higher , but that 's a point @entity67 is distinctly against			2
the @entity7 manager prefers to track @entity2 's progress himself in the development squad			1
‘ at 16 or 17 i do n’t think it ’s good for them to go somewhere else to play , like in the @entity60 , ' said @entity67			0
' at 17 they have to train with us and they have to learn with us			0
they will learn a lot			0
' happy , @entity2 ? @entity7 saw off interest from @entity56 , who want to take the midfielder on loan chance ? @entity2 will try to break into the first team again but must beat a host of talented names to do so sticking around : @entity7 want to track @entity2 's progress in their development squad for the time being			1

@entity2 made @entity7 senior debut in @entity69 in january against @entity70
@entity116 , @entity57 and @entity58 wanted to take 19 - year - old on loan
@entity2 would likely cost potential buyers about £ 5million despite the attacking midfielder being *unproven* in the @entity194
@entity7 saw off interest to keep starlet @entity2 in their development squad
