@entity0 was a picture of anguish at the @entity3 as his last - gasp shot to cap a courageous @entity6 fightback flew wide of the posts but this dramatic draw may yet be enough for a quarter - final place			1
at half - time yesterday , the home side had appeared down and out ; destined to lose this @entity13 decider and fall short in their quest to qualify for the last eight of the inaugural @entity16			1
they were 20 - 6 adrift at that stage and barely had a toe - hold in the game as @entity22 carved them open with alarming ease			1
but by the end , the tables had been turned in emphatic fashion			0
@entity29 ’s men claimed 14 unanswered points after the break with two converted tries and they so nearly snatched a memorable victory			2
@entity6 @entity0 attempts a last minute drop - goal that would have brought the hosts victory @entity6 ended up drawing 20 - 20 with @entity22 after @entity0 missed a last second opportunity @entity0 reaacts after missing the late chance that allowed @entity22 to progress to the quarter - finals in the last minute , @entity6 pounded on and on into opposition territory and once they had breached the @entity41 visitors ’ 22 , @entity0 set himself for the high - stakes drop goal			1
if he had hit the target , his club would have gone through as pool winners			0
instead , the veteran fly - half ’s kick missed to the right and he was left crouched and desolate			1
yet , @entity6 ’ stirring rearguard action — in response to a calamitous first half — could see them qualify among the leading runners - up			2
their fate is in the hands of other @entity57 teams today , namely @entity58 and @entity59			0
if the latter win or claim two bonus points in defeat at @entity63 , @entity64 are likely to miss the cut , but if last year ’s finalists are limited to one point , or none at all , @entity6 can reach the knock - out phase , where they would face a daunting away tie			2
at least they are in contention , which seemed a far - fetched notion for so long yesterday			0
@entity73 was forced off after suffering a shoulder injury in the opening minutes of the game @entity22 's @entity76 ( centre ) breaks through as the visitors take control of the game @entity81 of @entity6 ( left ) tangles with @entity82 of @entity22 during the @entity16 game after another impressive personal contribution , @entity87 — the home captain — said : ‘ i ’m disappointed and frustrated because i feel we should have had that			1
‘ we did n’t get it right in the first half but when we came in for half - time we realised we had to step it up and we won the second - half battle			0
’ asked if he would be watching @entity58 — who host @entity96 at @entity97 — and @entity59 with interest , he added : ‘ i wo n’t watch any rugby tomorrow			0
i ’ll just let it all unfold			0
‘ we should be good enough not to have to rely on other people			0
we ’ve showed again that we play well with our backs to the wall , but i know we are good enough to do it from the start			0
’ wasps were all at sea in the first half , after flanker @entity81 was sin - binned from the kick - off , for colliding with the airborne @entity73			2
the @entity22 wing was forced to go off injured moments later and his head coach , @entity112 , cast doubt on the sanction for the offence			2
@entity116 ( top ) of @entity6 takes possession in the lineout during the game in @entity121 @entity122 of @entity22 brushes off @entity123 ( left ) wasps centre @entity124 outpaces @entity22 player @entity126 ( right ) as the hosts comeback ‘ the frustration for us is that we lose a bloke for 80 minutes and they lose a bloke for 10 minutes			1
that does n’t make sense to me			0
‘ players have a duty of care to make sure that the guy in the air lands safely			0
’ later in the first half , @entity6 prop @entity139 received a yellow card , but @entity22 also lost lock @entity142 to the sin bin			1
the visitors , with @entity145 running amok in midfield — to atone in part for his persistent goal - kicking lapses — sent @entity150 over in the right corner early on and @entity152 touched down just before the break			1
but @entity6 rallied strongly in the second half and their driving maul yielded two tries in the left corner , from attacking penalties			2
the home pack forced @entity161 prop @entity160 over the line in the 62nd minute and , seven minutes later , @entity163 lunged to score from close range			0
@entity0 landed the wide conversion at the second attempt to level the match , after @entity22 players had rushed out too soon , but their pressure on the @entity170 at the end paid off , sending the @entity41 side into the quarter - finals as pool winners			1
the pitch starts to carve up after a scrum during the @entity178 match referee @entity179 prepares to yellow card @entity6 player @entity81 ( right ) wasps wing @entity123 runs at @entity22 replacement @entity182 before the game finished level			1

@entity22 reached the @entity16 quarter - finals despite draw
@entity0 missed a late drop kick that would have given @entity6 victory
@entity150 and @entity152 claimed the visitor 's tries
