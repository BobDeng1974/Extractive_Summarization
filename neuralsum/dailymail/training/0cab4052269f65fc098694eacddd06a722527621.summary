@entity0 has dismissed the notion that scrummaging is a ‘ dark art ’ and has called on officials to sharpen up so less time is spent re-setting the set - piece			1
many spectators are left frustrated by the number of stoppages that - despite new @entity11 regulations to reduce the number of collapsed scrums - disrupt the flow of play and cause games to run well beyond 80 minutes			2
with 39 appearances in the @entity19 front row to his name , @entity0 is in a strong position to comment			1
the new regulations put more emphasis on pre-binding than a powerful engagement and the former @entity27 prop believes more clarity is needed with the referees			1
@entity0 , in action for the @entity31 , tackles @entity33 flanker @entity32 at @entity34 ‘ i think there are a lot of good points about the new scrummaging laws , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we ’ve got hookers hooking again and we ’ve got scrums generally staying up more than when we had just a full out hit without the bind			2
it would be good to speed them up a bit , but how do we do that ? ‘ i hate this ‘ dark arts ’ label of no - one knowing what ’s going on			0
if you speak to any bio-kinnetist of physiologist , it ’s all about body positions and power vectors			0
if you ’re a referee at the highest level today , you ’ve got to know exactly what ’s going on			0
it ’s not an excuse to say that it ’s just the front row so no one knows , because it ’s not actually that difficult			1
it ’s just a perception			0
’ the new regulations surrounding the collision at the scrum are also intended to reduce injury			2
a report in the @entity66 of sports medicine found that in the 2011/12 @entity70 season , before the new rules were introduced , 88 per cent of scrum - related injuries fell upon those in the front row			1
@entity0 ( right ) tries to halt the progress of @entity33 fly - half @entity73 last saturday but @entity19 still have a high injury toll among their forwards – with @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 all among the front row absentees – and @entity0 believes the added emphasis on scrummaging in the northern hemisphere is a root of the problem			1
‘ the @entity70 is the toughest competition in world rugby in terms of playing good teams week in week out , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ there ’s not a huge amount of rest time and more you ’ve got a set piece battle every single weekend			0
in @entity97 there are big dynamic back lines and big physical ball carriers , but in the @entity70 you ’ve an extremely physical pack to deal with			0
i think it takes its toll			0
‘ i do n’t know the nature of all of @entity19 ’s injuries , but @entity79 ’s is a neck injury , which is a scrummaging injury			1
he played a huge amount of @entity107 early on in his career			0
you battle it out you eventually get injured			0
in professional rugby that ’s what happens			0
’ former @entity27 prop @entity0 was part of @entity114 's 2013 @entity113 squad that toured @entity33			1

former @entity27 prop @entity0 has won 39 caps for @entity19
@entity19 have a high number of front row injuries with @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 all out of action
@entity0 believes emphasis on scrummaging in the northern hemisphere is the root of @entity19 's injury problems in the forwards
