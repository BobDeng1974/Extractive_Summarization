by @entity0 last updated at 12:12 pm on 16th december 2011 the ' sculptor ' galaxy - also known as the @entity3 , or the @entity4 - is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky			1
it 's peppered with hot , young stars that have just ignited			0
the new @entity12 telescope - the biggest visible - light telescope in the world - in @entity14 has captured the most detailed view of the @entity16 yet seen			1
a picture released by the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) shows a wide - field view of the sculptor - also known as the @entity4 - from the @entity12 @entity16 is a spiral galaxy 11.5 million light years away in the constellation of @entity16			1
radiation from the young stars in the sculptor makes the surrounding hydrogen gas glow brightly			0
astronomers have called it a ' starburst ' galaxy because of the number of young stars forming in it			0
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) 's picture is probably the most detailed wide - field view of this object and its surroundings ever taken			2
it is easy to get a good look at @entity16 through binoculars - it is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky after the @entity45 ’s closest , big galactic neighbor , the @entity46			0
the many bright clumps dotting the galaxy are stellar nurseries where hot young stars have just ignited			2
the radiation streaming from these giant blue - white babies makes the surrounding hydrogen gas clouds glow brightly the original picture is more than 12,000 pixels across - the superb sky conditions at @entity18 ’s @entity56 , combined with the fine telescope optics , result in sharp star images over the entire image			0
the original picture is more than 12,000 pixels across - the superb sky conditions at @entity60 s @entity56 , combined with the fine telescope optics , result in sharp star images over the entire image @entity12 is the largest telescope in the world designed to exclusively survey the sky in visible light , complementing @entity18 ’s @entity66 infrared survey telescope , also located at @entity56 .			1

@entity12 in @entity14 is biggest exclusively designed to capture visible light
view of @entity16 - also known as @entity3 or @entity70
' @entity73 ' galaxy is peppered with young , bright stars
