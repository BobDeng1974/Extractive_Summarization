by @entity0 for @entity1 a girl who once suffered panic attacks whenever she left her home has conquered her fears to become a beauty queen			2
@entity7 , 23 , from @entity8 , developed agoraphobia when she was 19 years old and suffered severe panic attacks and anxiety when she went outside			1
the former @entity13 student became so terrified of the outside world she was unable to even walk to her local newsagent or shopping centre			0
@entity7 , 23 , pictured in an evening gown as she competes for the title of miss @entity19 when she could n't find work after college she stayed at home ' because i did n't really have much to get up for ' but after four years of isolation @entity7 finally faced up to her fears after spotting an advertisement for miss @entity27			1
@entity7 said : ' after i finished college i was at home a lot more often because i did n't really have much to get up for			1
' i was looking for a job and had decided against going to university but when i could n't find work i started staying in the house most days and would rarely go out			1
' i remember one day i went out to take my dog for a walk and this wave of panic came over me , i actually thought i was dying because i could n't breathe			2
' after that i would associate places i went as the causes of the panic attacks so would avoid them			0
' but the places i could go became so narrowed that in the end i would just stay in my house where i knew i was safe			2
' @entity7 was fine until she developed a fear of leaving the house at 19 , but faced up to it after four years @entity7 became a recluse , excusing herself from family events and refusing friend 's plans as she was too afraid to leave her home			1
it was n't until she broke down crying to her mother that she sought help for the phobia that was ruling her life			1
she said : ' i felt so isolated and i was even losing friends because every time they asked me to do something i would just make up an excuse			2
agoraphobia is an intense fear of being in public places where you feel escape might be difficult			2
sufferers tend to avoid public places , and may not even venture out from home			0
the phobia tends to arise as a result of associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them			0
' it had got to the point where when my family went out for a meal i 'd make excuses and have beans on toast at home			0
' one day i just broke down in tears to my mum and told her how i was feeling			0
' she told me i could n't go on like this and that i was like a prisoner in my own home , which i was			2
' i went to the doctors but they just told me it was something that would pass and sent me away			0
' but as the months passed @entity7 's mental health worsened and she was referred to an anxiety group for help			1
it was there , with the help of her mother @entity99 , that she learnt how to control her panic attacks with breathing techniques			0
while recovering , @entity7 spotted a @entity103 advertisement for miss @entity27 and , although she was still struggling with her phobia , she decided to enter			1
@entity7 said : ' my mum was really worried because she did n't want it to knock my confidence while i was still getting better but i knew i wanted to do it			1
after getting used to being in the house , when she took the dog for a walk she had a panic attack ' i sent off my picture and got through to the telephone audition round , where i spoke about my personality and life			0
' surprisingly they told me i had got through to the final stages and invited me down to @entity119			0
@entity7 was competing for the title of miss @entity19 and was up against 10 other hopefuls			1
despite still being afraid @entity7 knew that to compete she would need to face her fears and tackle her phobia head - on			1
she said : ' i knew that i needed to go out shopping and get a dress , have my nails done and get ready for the pageant			0
' it was terrifying though as the last time i had stepped foot in a shopping centre i had had a panic attack			0
' but i knew i would n't be able to compete if i did n't get over my fear			0
although @entity7 did suffer a panic attack , she was able to calm herself down using the breathing techniques she 'd been taught and continue her trip - something that she had never before been able to do			2
whilst recovering @entity7 spotted a @entity103 advertisement for miss @entity27 and she applied pageant was last week and @entity7 narrowly missed out on becoming miss @entity19 the beauty queen hopeful said : ' i was so proud of myself when it passed because i then knew that i would be okay			1
' i just kept telling myself while it was happening that â€˜ you ca n't compete if you ca n't do this , get over it ' and i did			0
the @entity27 pageant was held last week on august 7 at the @entity149 in @entity119 and @entity7 narrowly missed out on being named miss @entity19 in the semi-finals of the competition , the so - called regional heats			1
but for the former recluse the competition was about much more than winning as she has been able to get her life back on track			2
' the competition gave me my confidence back and an aim to get up every day and head for			1
' it was n't about winning for me it was to show people that you do n't have to look a certain way to suffer with a mental health issue and that people need to get rid of the stigma that surrounds mental health			0
