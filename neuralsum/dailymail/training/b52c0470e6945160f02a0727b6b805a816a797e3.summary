by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 16:53 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 16:53 est , 26 august 2013 fighting back : @entity2 the rescued dog from @entity4 is preparing to compete at @entity5 with his new owner @entity6 he was a fighting - dog who endured brutal beatings , had his ears and tail severed and was left for dead on the streets of @entity4			1
but now the only adversaries @entity2 has to worry about are the other crossbreeds at @entity15			1
the four - year - old mongrel was rescued from his ordeal in @entity18 by @entity20 soldiers – and has battled through to the final qualification round of the dog show			2
fittingly , it is to be held on @entity24 in central @entity25			0
whatever the outcome of the ‘ @entity5 ’ section of the @entity30 competition – for ‘ crossbreed dogs of mixed blood ’ – there will be no other dog with a story to match @entity2 ’s			1
‘ it is an extraordinary life and journey , ’ said @entity6 , @entity2 ’s owner – a life made possible by the charity founded by @entity38 that rescues dogs befriended by servicemen and aid workers in @entity4 before reuniting them back home			1
so far @entity47 , based on the outskirts of the @entity4 capital @entity1 , has sent more than 550 dogs to new lives			1
by the time @entity2 reached the clinic , he had already cheated death repeatedly			1
a convoy of @entity20 soldiers on patrol in @entity18 had gone to his aid in february 2011 when a crowd watching a dog - fight were beating @entity2 with lumps of wood			1
back at base , @entity2 was patched up by an @entity64 woman soldier , who feared he would not last the night			1
astonishingly , he did but days later was back after dog - fighters had hacked off his ears , before cutting his muzzle open			2
he was again patched up only to return with new injuries that included a stab wound to the chest and a severed tail			1
brutalised : @entity2 when he was rescued in @entity18 after thugs threw him under a car the @entity64 soldier began planning to take him home			1
@entity47 has launched an urgent appeal to help fund a new clinic in @entity1 after being forced to leave its present secure premises			0
founder @entity38 warns the failure to secure sufficient funds threatens its existence			0
more than 550 dogs have so far passed through @entity47 ’s kennels , with the charity arranging chipping and the taking of blood samples – which are then sent to the @entity20 authorities – followed by four months ’ quarantine for the @entity20 , 30 days for the @entity90			0
to donate go to @entity91			0
like many soldiers who befriended dogs during @entity4 tours of duty , she knew of the work of @entity47 , which had been set up by @entity38 , then a @entity98 sergeant , after he broke up a dog fight in the @entity101 town of @entity102 in 2006 and adopted one of the dogs within months , the charity was formed			2
‘ the relationships built up between a dog and soldier on bases can be very special , ’ @entity106 , 43 , from @entity107 , said			0
‘ a dog can ease the stress and provide five minutes of normality that is hugely important in that kind of environment			0
’ @entity2 was treated by @entity47 vets before being placed in kennels in the @entity119 during his quarantine			2
but he was refused entry to @entity64			0
one of his regular visitors was @entity6 , 35 , from @entity123 , @entity124			0
she says quickly a ‘ love affair with a lovely dog ’ began			0
as a way of highlighting the work of @entity47 , @entity6 decided to enter @entity2 for @entity5 – and to her delight he has reached the ‘ semi-final ’ on @entity130			2
‘ it would be so wonderful , so fitting , if he was to win on that day , ’ she said .			0
