the focus on @entity104 history has been reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent because it was felt that pupils will have already developed a ‘ good understanding ’ from @entity108 studies			2
more maths is being introduced to economics , computer science and psychology a-levels as well as the three sciences			0
other changes include a new emphasis on drawing in art and design , and fieldwork being reintroduced in geography so pupils ‘ relate their learning to real experiences of the world ’ .			0
