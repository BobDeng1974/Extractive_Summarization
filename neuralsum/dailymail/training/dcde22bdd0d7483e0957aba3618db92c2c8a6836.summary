@entity1 and @entity2 will flock to @entity3 in far greater numbers than forecast as our economy races ahead of the rest of @entity8 , a secret report predicts			1
after immigration controls are lifted this week , @entity3 could find their jobs are squeezed in some areas – while community tensions could rise as the new wave of migrants fight for work with other @entity8 who have been settled in @entity3 for a decade , it suggests			1
the @entity19 - funded review – obtained by @entity20 – also suggests that the @entity3 could lose out financially if low - paid @entity1 and @entity2 drive out @entity21 on higher wages , who pay more tax			1
from wednesday , @entity1 and @entity2 , known as @entity26 migrants , will have the same rights as other @entity29 citizens to live and work throughout @entity8 , but @entity3 is likely to be seen as more attractive than other countries struggling to make an economic comeback			1
the authoritative report by @entity34 academics was commissioned ahead of the change by a group of 74 councils in the @entity38 of @entity39 , working with the @entity40 , police and health services , but has not been officially publicised			0
obtained under a @entity45 request , the 40 - page report reveals that migration overall was likely to be beneficial to the @entity3 but warns that : already overcrowded schools will struggle to find places for the children of the new arrivals			1
overstretched hospitals risk coming under fresh strain , and the housing crisis could get worse			1
the cost to taxpayers of state handouts , such as @entity57 , could go up			1
town halls may fail to collect enough council tax from new immigrants to pay for the extra services because they often crowd into one home and have ‘ makeshift accommodation arrangements ’			1
the government has refused to say how many @entity2 and @entity1 it expects to come			2
the new report also gives no figures but suggests the recent growth in jobs in @entity3 , and lengthening dole queues elsewhere in @entity8 , will encourage more to come here than might be anticipated on previous trends			1
the study drawn up for the @entity72 says that immigration restrictions ‘ are ending when employment across the @entity29 is changing , ’ which could have an impact on migration patterns			2
@entity1 and @entity2 could compete for the jobs of previous immigrants such as @entity21 significantly , it adds : ‘ against this background it is feasible the @entity3 might receive a larger share of @entity26 migrants than in the recent past			1
’ it says a crucial issue is whether @entity1 and @entity2 think @entity3 ’s economic revival is here to stay – if so , it will have ‘ a greater impact on migration patterns ’			1
our financial turnaround may well be long term			0
last week , one forecast predicted the @entity3 economy will outstrip @entity95 by 2018 and @entity96 12 years later			0
the authors of the £ 5,000 @entity99 university report , @entity100 and @entity101 , say there is little evidence @entity8 migrants take jobs from @entity3 workers overall , though this will ‘ vary across localities ’			1
but since 2004 , when @entity21 and seven other @entity8 countries – the so - called @entity109 – won full rights within the @entity29 , ‘ the employment rate of @entity3 - born 16 to 64 - year - old residents in the @entity38 has fallen somewhat whereas that of not @entity3 - born other white residents has increased somewhat			1
’ worryingly , the report also raises the prospect of tensions between @entity1 and @entity2 on one side and the first wave of @entity8 immigrants on the other			1
it speculates that lower skilled @entity2 and @entity1 could undercut existing @entity21 migrants – with damaging consequences for community relations , and potentially the economy , especially if newly unemployed @entity21 sign on			1
@entity126 , who has a @entity21 building firm in @entity128 , said : ‘ there ’s a lot of fear the cheaper end of the market will collapse under pressure from @entity1 and @entity2 workers who , for a short time , will accept any prices			1
’ @entity138 : ' i came from @entity2 to work , but unskilled migrants are a worry ' by @entity142 talented student @entity144 , who came to @entity3 last year to pursue his dream of becoming an airline pilot , shares worries that some of his fellow countrymen about to arrive here may not improve his country ’s image			1
mr @entity144 , 27 , says he believes many @entity2 will take advantage of the relaxation in immigration rules , including some with few skills or qualifications			0
mr @entity144 , who has a masters degree in @entity39 , was allowed to settle here before the rule change under exemptions for highly skilled immigrants			0
he is the model of a bright , hard - working young person who left his native country to seek a better life abroad			0
‘ i am very proud of my country and came here because i am ambitious , ’ said mr @entity144 , who works as a minicab driver , regularly working seven days a week			0
‘ quite a lot of @entity2 will come here because there are jobs in @entity3			1
i am a little worried that some may live up to @entity2 ’s image as having a low - skilled workforce			1
‘ that would be wrong because most young people in @entity2 are educated , hard - working , have strong characters and could have a positive effect in @entity3			1
@entity178 want to come here to earn enough money to educate their own children			0
’ no one could call mr @entity144 low - skilled			2
his fluent @entity39 reflects the masters degree he obtained in @entity2			0
he paid for private tuition in maths and physics to improve his chances of achieving his dream of becoming a pilot and is determined to raise the six figure sum he needs to train to get his wings			0
‘ i will not give up until i have done it , ’ he says			0
the view from there : @entity194 : 34 cram into a nine - seater bus by @entity196 @entity1 and @entity2 are planning to share car journeys or cram vehicles to come to @entity3			1
the rush to migrate was illustrated just before @entity200 when a minibus designed for nine people was stopped in the @entity204 city of @entity205			0
it contained 34 @entity2 who had left @entity207 en route for an unspecified western country			0
forums on @entity2 websites are carrying inquiries from people wanting to share cars or find out the price of petrol for a trip across @entity8			2
it is feared that when they get to the @entity3 , they could elbow @entity3 graduates out of the job market			0
@entity1 and @entity2 have a large number of highly qualified it specialists , entrepreneurs , aspiring lawyers and accountants and many of them speak good @entity39 and other languages			2
@entity231 , a @entity3 businesswoman who has lived and worked in @entity1 since 1985 , said : ‘ i ’ve met young @entity1 who speak four or five languages			2
it gives them a flexibility and adaptability that most @entity3 job seekers lack			0
’ @entity237 , 24 , wants a job in digital marketing or web development , but is in no hurry to rush to the @entity3			0
with a degree from a @entity243 and another from @entity244 , she said she would like to return to the @entity3 , but not until the furore over so - called ‘ benefits tourism ’ has died down			2
she said : ‘ @entity3 does n’t really want us at the moment			2
people there think we will be taking their jobs			0
but i would go if i had a firm offer or a contract			0
’ another would - be migrant , @entity255 , 36 , who speaks @entity39 , @entity256 and some @entity96 and @entity95 , plans to set up a telecoms consultancy in @entity3			2
he said : ‘ i would n’t say i am better than a @entity3 person but i have travelled to many countries and i am very familiar with @entity8 , which has an expanding telecoms market			2
’ residents of @entity262 in @entity263 , identified as having one of the highest concentrations of @entity2 and @entity1 immigrants in the @entity38 , said they feared already oversubscribed schools and hospitals will fail to cope with more demand			1
@entity270 , 53 , said : ‘ there ’s no room at the schools or extra places			2
at my doctor ’s surgery you ca n’t get an appointment for at least two weeks			0
’ the @entity34 report says the impact of migration on public services will be limited ‘ in the short run ’ because most new arrivals will be young people looking for work , though ‘ existing pressure points are likely to be stretched further ’			2
but there will be an impact on schools as one in three @entity1 and @entity2 immigrants are expected to have school - age children – and one in four will have babies – within four years of arriving			1
@entity297 ’s sir @entity296 said : ‘ the clear conclusion of this report is that we can expect further migration from @entity2 and @entity1 next year			2
however , they duck the key question of numbers			0
’ @entity307 manager @entity306 said the report was designed to assist councils with their planning rather than making firm predictions			0
he said there were no suggestions that there might be violence but ‘ there can be resentments within communities when there is competition for resources ’			0
meanwhile , councils outside of the @entity38 have expressed concerns in internal documents , obtained by @entity20			0
@entity326 council said increased pressures on housing could lead to growing homelessness , and that both @entity1 and @entity2 had high levels of diseases such as tuberculosis , mumps , measles and rubella			1
@entity336 highlighted concerns over its @entity339 community , saying there were high rates of truancy and teenage pregnancy			0
residents also complained that @entity339 households ‘ appeared to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle without appearing to work ’			0
despite the fears , virtually no councils have drawn up plans to deal with the expected influx of @entity2 and @entity1			0
one exception was @entity263 , which estimated that the new arrivals could cost it £ 3 million in extra services , including 390 extra primary school places , though that would be outweighed by the benefit to the economy			1
@entity358 has announced controversial plans for curbs on benefits and a review of @entity29 freedom of movement laws to end ‘ vast migrations ’ from poorer @entity8 countries .			1

@entity1 and @entity2 will have the same rights as other @entity29 citizens to live and work throughout @entity8 , but @entity3 is likely to be seen as more attractive than other countries struggling to make an economic comeback
the @entity19 - funded review – obtained by @entity20 – also suggests that the @entity3 could lose out financially if low - paid @entity1 and @entity2 drive out @entity21 on higher wages , who pay more tax
