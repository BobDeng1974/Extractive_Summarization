@entity9 's deputy leader @entity2 said @entity4 was ' unrealistic ' ms @entity2 has been married to @entity24 , a former union official and now fellow mp , for 30 years			1
a staunch campaigner for women ’s rights and sexual equality , she told party activists that in her new role as @entity31 she was always asked what she is reading			1
‘ just the other week , i had an awkward moment when a journalist asked me if i 'd read " that " book			0
women here will know the one ... ‘ the one about a sado - masochistic relationship - you know … with a dominant superior controlling a naive submissive			2
‘ and i said : " do n't be silly - of course i 've read the coalition agreement "			0
’ bake - off not bed : @entity9 's deputy leader @entity2 said unlike @entity4 ( right ) most women do not want to be tied up for sex but to watch cookery programmes like the @entity46 ( left ) to gasps in the conference hall , ms @entity2 then admitted : ‘ as it happens i have also read @entity4 … for research purposes			1

‘ you know @entity83 used to be @entity82 's favourite computer game - now it 's his pet name for @entity88 and @entity89			0
’ far from reviewing popular literature , the deputy leader ’s speech at the @entity9 conference is traditionally a tub - thumping affair aimed at sending delegates home with a spring in their step			1
