when @entity3 was plucked from @entity4 by @entity2 in a Â£ 5million deal on transfer deadline day , the name of one former @entity2 youngster came to the minds of many - @entity8			1
could the 18 - year - old who has been lighting up @entity10 this season avoid becoming yet another @entity12 starlet who failed to live up to expectations after moving to a big club ? @entity4 boss @entity15 has insisted in the past that the midfielder possesses a level of maturity beyond his tender years , and the question in the short term is whether @entity23 can keep his head down and maintain the level of performance that secured his transfer to @entity2 in the first place			1
@entity4 midfielder @entity23 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity31 's @entity30 for the most part against @entity31 , the evidence suggested yes			1
one thing is for sure , the surface at @entity37 will never be as bad as it was at @entity38 on monday night - and @entity23 's attempts to bring a level of control to midfield were certainly hampered in the early exchanges			1
of course , there was always a chance that his touch suffered in the knowledge that , live on @entity50 , there would be more eyes upon him than ever before in his short career			0
@entity2 boss @entity55 was , in all likelihood , watching on from somewhere			2
and tiredness could n't have helped either			0
it had , after all , been little over 48 hours since @entity4 played out a 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity61			1
@entity4 knew that a win would take them top of @entity10 , while @entity31 were hoping to end the night in the play - off places - and the first half was not exactly a classic			1
@entity23 was signed by @entity2 on transfer deadline day before being loaned back to @entity4 @entity23 showed plenty of hustle and bustle , especially in his attempts to support lone striker @entity73 at every available opportunity , but the first half was a struggle for the youngster			1
things started better after the interval			0
one lively run down the right , while ultimately futile , did successfully showcase the strength and speed			0
then , in the 54th minute , @entity23 opened the scoring after being assisted by the game 's key player - the @entity38 pitch			1
@entity31 goalkeeper @entity88 scuffed what should have been a straightforward clearance right into the path of @entity73 on the edge of the area , the striker squared to @entity23 , and he made no mistake in sliding the ball under the red - faced keeper			1
goal number 13 of the season , as cool as you like			0
somewhere @entity55 would have been nodding approvingly			0
@entity23 ( left ) attempts to take the ball past @entity102 's @entity101 during the first half @entity31 , however , recently came back from a two - goal deficit to beat @entity105 at @entity106			2
compared to that , @entity4 at home is easy pickings , and just 15 minutes later they were ahead thanks to @entity110 and @entity111			0
@entity23 took it upon himself to try and get his side back into the game			2
first he appeared at left back to halt an opposition attack , then at right back in attempt to drive the @entity4 forward			0
but in the end it was defeat , and his fight to help @entity4 to promotion before his summer departure took something of a setback			0
one thing is for sure , though , @entity127 is definitely a talent			0
but if he is to succeed for @entity2 in the future , he will be far better off back on loan at @entity132 next season - either in the @entity133 or @entity10 - then warming the bench at @entity37 .			2

@entity2 signing @entity3 impresses for @entity4 against @entity137
18 - year - old opened the scoring but his side went on to lose 2 - 1 on monday
