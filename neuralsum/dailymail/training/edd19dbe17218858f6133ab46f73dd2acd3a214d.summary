by @entity1 reporter published : 22:49 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 26 august 2013 a @entity3 man and several of his friends say they were refused service at a @entity6 in @entity7 last month and asked to leave			1
the reason : @entity9 and his group of 24 friends and family members are @entity13 , and another customer - a white woman - complained that she felt threatened by the group			2
that 's according to @entity9 , who was celebrating his cousin 's last day in @entity7 with a night out at the @entity6			1
@entity9 took his beef to social media , and the story went viral			1
the apparent race - based snub came after @entity9 and his group waited for a table for about two hours			1
discriminated : @entity9 ( center ) and his family were denied service at a @entity3 restaurant after a white woman claimed she felt threatened ignored : @entity9 says the restaurant 's corporate office ignored his multiple calls to tell them about the incident ' she said there 's a situation where one of our customers feels threatened by your party , so she asked us not to seat you in our section , which totally alarmed all of us because we 're sitting there peaceably for two hours , ' @entity9 explained to @entity45			1
' obviously , if we were causing any conflict , we would have been ejected out of the place hours before			0
' as @entity9 and the shift manager were talking , a member of his party began videotaping the conversation , which is when the manager became upset and refused to seat the group			2
' i asked her i want to be clear with you , ' @entity9 told the station			1
' i said so you 're telling me i have to leave			0
she said i have a right to deny you service			0
i said so you 're asking me to leave because you 're upset because he was recording you , after we 've waited for two hours , and after you 've already pretty much discriminated on us , and she answered yes			2
' @entity64 : after @entity9 posted this on the restaurant 's @entity67 page , he finally got a call from the corporate office not satisfied : @entity9 says the restaurant 's offer of a free meal is n't enough for more videos , please go to @entity45 @entity9 called the restaurant 's corporate headquarters repeatedly to explain what had happened to the manager 's superiors			1
but nobody ever called him back - so he turned to @entity67			0
' i will never go to wild wings cafe in n. chs again ! we ( party of 25 family and friends ) waited 2hrs , patiently and were refused service because another customer ( @entity89 ) felt threatened by us			0
this type of racial discrimination is unacceptable and we have to put a stop to it			0
the manager looked me dead in the face and said she was refusing us service because she had a right to and simply she felt like it			0
do not support this establishment ... please share this post ... we need your help , ' he posted on the restaurant 's @entity67 page			2
after @entity9 's post started getting a bit of attention , the restaurant finally acknowledged @entity9 's complaint			1
' we got alerted through social media , so we always encourage our customers to respond to us or to comment on our social media pages , ' @entity110 , the chief marketing officer for @entity6 , told the station			1
after the post , representatives for @entity6 said they immediately responded and spoke to @entity9			2
' we had a conversation , ' said @entity110			0
' it was a really good conversation			0
he and many of his family and friends were there about a month ago , and they are regular customers of ours			0
so , they were having a going away party , and they just did n't receive the experience that they have come to know and love			0
' at no point did @entity110 deny that @entity9 's story was true			1
the restaurant offered @entity9 and his family a free meal for the entire group			1
but @entity9 is n't completely satisfied			0
' we were n't coming there for a free meal			2
when we came there that night , we were coming to patronize the business			0
this is not a situation where you can just give us a free meal and everything is ok because it 's deeper than that , ' he said			1
as of sunday night , @entity9 's post was shared on @entity67 nearly 3,000 times .			2

@entity9 and his family were asked to leave a @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity3 after the group waited patiently for two hours
the restaurant 's corporate headquarters ignored @entity9 's repeated calls to report the situation
it was n't until @entity9 told his story on social media that the restaurant acknowledged him
the restaurant then offered him a free meal
