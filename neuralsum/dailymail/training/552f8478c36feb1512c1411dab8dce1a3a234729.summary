schools should take children from the age of two to stop the poorest pupils falling behind , the head of @entity1 will say today			2
thousands of youngsters are being ‘ let down ’ by poor quality nurseries and childminders who fail to equip them with basic skills , according to sir @entity12			2
he will say school - based nurseries should begin to teach children as young as two to count , hold a pen and recognise words			0
learning : sir @entity12 , @entity1 chief inspector , watches youngsters at play during his visit to the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , on the eve of the publication of the @entity25 many children - particularly those from low - income families - have an ‘ unsure ’ start to their education which leads to lower achievement as they progress through school , he will claim			1
sir @entity12 will deliver the advice in @entity1 ’s first major report on childcare and early education , which is being launched today			1
he will also call for parents to be given more help to find adequate childcare provision			0
the report will highlight an achievement gap between children from disadvantaged families and more affluent youngsters , which opens up during their earliest months and continues as they progress through school			2
only a third of children from low - income homes have reached what is considered a ‘ good ’ level of development by the age of five			0
‘ too many of our poorest children are getting an unsure start because the early years system is letting them down , ’ sir @entity12 will say			1
‘ what children facing serious disadvantage need is high quality early education from the age of two , delivered by skilled practitioners with degrees in a setting that parents can recognise and access easily			2
’ the report will call for a radical shake - up of early years care in @entity74 which would entail schools ‘ taking the lead ’ in providing good quality early education , particularly among youngsters from the poorest backgrounds			1
' children need education from the age of two ' : sir @entity12 will use the report to call for an expansion of nursery schooling to even younger children , in the hope that this will stop disadvantaged youngsters falling behind speaking yesterday at @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity22 , sir @entity12 said : ‘ the attainment gap between poor children and their more prosperous peers is large and if you are going to narrow it , it needs to start much earlier on			1
‘ it needs to start before school starts , so therefore the early years provision has to be good			2
‘ we are saying it is n’t good enough , and we see better provision for poor children , where those gaps emerge , in school - based settings , and we are urging @entity108 to put more early years settings into schools			1
’ sir @entity12 said @entity1 wanted a greater emphasis on teaching children core skills - ‘ how to hold a pen , the ability to count , to recognise words , to communicate well with each other and their teachers ’			1
schools , nurseries and childminders will be expected to run regular assessments of children as young as two in literacy and numeracy			0
many schools with nurseries currently only take children from the age of three			0
fun times : the report will call for a radical shake - up of early years care in @entity74 which would entail schools ' taking the lead ' in providing good quality early education , but critics warn of the ' schoolification ' of childhood education minister @entity140 is already writing to councils to ask them to extend provision for two - year - olds and open school nurseries for longer to cover the working day			1
however the plans are proving controversial amid concerns over the ‘ schoolification ’ of early childhood			0
@entity150 , director of daynurseries.co.uk , said : ‘ assessment at a young age would undermine natural development			0
‘ rather than giving two - year - olds tests , we should be giving them the opportunity to learn through interaction and play			0
' we need to change the notion that “ starting sooner means improved results later ”			0

children of poor families suffer ' unsure start ' to education , sir @entity12 warns
this , he says , leads to lower achievement as they progress through school
@entity1 report will call for schools to take the lead in early years education
but critics of the *proposals* warn of the ' schoolification ' of childhood
