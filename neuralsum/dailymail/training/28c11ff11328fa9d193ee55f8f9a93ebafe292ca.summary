patrons complaining that the sight of other customers wearing sweaty cycle clothing puts them off their food has prompted a hotel to ban the controversial lycra attire			1
@entity7 in @entity8 has done a complete backflip on its stance about allowing lycra - clad cyclists to dine in the venue as a sign was put up over the weekend declaring the right to refuse those wearing the fitted clothing			1
this comes just a week after four riders were refused service by a waiter due to their acquired look on sunday january 4 , and hotel management posted a clarification on @entity24 insisting that the issue was not about their fashion sense but with the potential hazard of the parked bikes			1
but the venue quickly changed its tune after an overwhelming number of disgusted patrons responded to the post saying they lose their appetites when laying eyes on the ' lycra 'd loonies '			1
@entity53 operations manager @entity52 told @entity54 that the descision was made after the social media response supporting such a ban			1
last monday , management posted that the real issue was with the bikes potentially causing a safety hazard along the footpath and encouraged cyclists to lobby the council for more bike racks outside the venue			1
' this decision was never a dress code issue , and if dress was communicated as the reason by our staff then we apologise for the misunderstanding and assure everyone that this is not the case , ' the hotel posted on its @entity24 page			2
described as the ' lycra 'd loonies ' , patrons lashed out on the post not only complaining about the revealing look but also the smell and sweat that they claim is left behind on the seats			1
' lycra 'd loonies , after pedalling around the countryside for hours , tend to get a bit on the nose , and there 's nothing worse than a bunch smelly , sweaty cyclists sitting near you to put you off your tucker , one patron said			1
' a good move by the publican , but he 'd better be ready for a flood of these @entity100 'd loonies descending on him just to get some publicity			0
' @entity103 said that he was at the pub on saturday when three lycra clad riders came in for lunch			1
' all fat in tight clothes thinking they are gunna be the next lance @entity113			0
@entity114 them all from entering places like that it puts you off your food			1
' @entity121 was also all for the lycra ban			1
' surely the issue is with old men ... ... ... ...			0
. not bike racks ! good on ya raffles for banning them			0
@entity100 is n't acceptable clothing , ' he posted			0
social media users also complained that cyclists leave sweat on the seats at pubs and cafes the cyclists have been described as ' lycra 'd loonies ' with one patron suggesting they open up their own cafe while @entity141 decided to share some practical tips with the cyclists			1
' if you 're riding for exercise , wear loose clothing , you 'll get more wind resistance and a better workout			0
you wo n't look as ridiculous and can stop for food wherever you like mostly			2
' ' if you 're racing then by all means , wear lycra for the aerodynamics , but you do n't have time to stop for a hot milk drink			0
' @entity155 suggested that the riders to ' stick to coffee shops '			0
who wants to see fat old men having some mid-life fitness crisis busting their fat guts while parading their tackle at my eye level when i take a seat , ' he posted			0
' although we all appreciate that you have taken the initiative to get fit please be considerate of others			0
' your clothing is quite revealing you have just ridden countless kilometres in the sun and some not all of you are on the nose			0
' @entity174 echoed those sentiments			0
' why do n't you do the polite thing like the rest of us and get out of your smelly exercise clothes and have a shower before heading somewhere for a pint or coffee ? ' she posted			0
' i do n't head to a restaurant or a coffee bar straight after the gym and i would be refused so why should you be treated differently because you have a hot shot bike and fancy clothes ? ' @entity189 suggested that cyclists open their own cafe			2
' that way the rest of the public dont need to sit in the sweat of cyclists mid way through their exercise , ' he said			0
' do n't really want to have coffee while 5 men walk past with their lycra clad junk at eye level either			2
' @entity207 , along with his wife and two friends , were denied service at @entity7 for wearing lycra the age - old issue resurfaced its ugly head on sunday morning when outraged customers were denied their regular sunday brunch at the local hotel because the keen cyclists were dressed in lycra			1
@entity207 walked into the @entity7 to grab a table ahead of his wife and their two mates , who had all just gone on a morning cycle , when he was approached by a staff member who confronted him with an unexpected remark			1
' sorry mate you ca n't come in here - we 've got a no lycra - free policy - we ca n't serve you , ' the waiter said			1
mr @entity207 was gobsmacked and told his companions as they walked in that they were not welcome due to their cycling attire			2
' i 've never been spoke to like that - it was horribly humiliating , ' mr @entity207 told @entity233			0
' i 'm 43 years old and a father of two kids - i 've never been kicked out of anywhere in my life - let alone for the clothes i was wearing			2
' his wife , @entity239 , questioned the waiter when the policy had been put in place and the waiter replied with two weeks ago			1
' my wife pointed out that we were served in lycra the week before and then he walked away , ' he said			1
mr @entity207 insists the move is blatant discrimination			0
' i think most pubs and clubs want young people who are hip and do n't like the older crowd as a general rule , ' he said			0
' people do n't like the way we look			0
' ' it would be considered discrimination if it happened to people with dogs or kids - or customers wearing high visibility clothing			2
' hotel management said there was no such policy but a concern for safety where some bikes were parked @entity233 approached the hotel for comment but has yet to have heard back			1
however , @entity53 operations manger @entity52 denied there was a lycra ban to the @entity54 saying the concern was residents complaining about some of the parked bikes causing a safety risk			1
' it is not our dress standard , ' he told the paper			0
' we 've served cyclists in lycra in the past and we 're happy to serve cyclists in lycra in the future			1
' mr @entity52 said the incident was a miscommunication which has now been clarified with the staff			0
but mr @entity207 said the hotel 's response was complete nonsense and that the message could not have been misconstrued			2
' it 's an absolute smokescreen - it 's just spin , ' he said			0
' there was no ambiguity - he was clear about the policy			2
' animosity towards cyclists is not a new issue and mr @entity207 , who owns the @entity306 shop in @entity8 , said everybody needed to ' take a chill pill '			1
' we all need to get along - the roads are for both cars and bikes , ' he said			0
mr @entity207 said he called the hotel on monday and was told he would be contacted that afternoon following a management meeting about the matter but was yet to hear back			2
mr @entity207 , who owns @entity306 , called for the animosity towards cyclists to be put to an end			2
