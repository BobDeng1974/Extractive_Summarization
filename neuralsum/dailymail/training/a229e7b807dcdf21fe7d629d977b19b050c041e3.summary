the rift between teachers and @entity2 widened yesterday when a moderate teachers ’ union passed a motion of no confidence in the @entity7 for the first time in its history			1
the @entity10 voted overwhelmingly that mr @entity2 and @entity12 chief sir @entity11 showed an ‘ abject failure to improve education or treat teachers , parents and pupils with respect ’			1
more militant unions regularly show dissatisfaction with @entity22 policies in similar debates			2
but the @entity10 ’s support for the first such motion in its 129 years indicates a hardening of opinion among teachers and other school staff			1
teachers from the @entity10 union passed a vote of no confidence in education secretary @entity2 ( left ) and @entity12 chief inspector sir @entity11 the two biggest unions – the @entity35 and the @entity36 – have already announced strike action over pay , conditions and pensions			1
there is also anger at mr @entity2 ’s attempts to toughen exams and get rid of ‘ trendy ’ methods he believes have lowered standards			2
@entity10 member @entity47 said teachers were overstretched and ‘ bullying by the two @entity55 ’ was affecting head teachers , ‘ who seem to feel they have to hand that down to staff ’			1
she added : ‘ we are saying enough is enough			0
’ teacher @entity57 , from @entity58 , north - west @entity59 , said teachers were not consulted about changes			2
she accused sir @entity2 of ‘ tinkering ’ to ‘ drive forward government policy for academies ’			2
earlier , general secretary dr @entity64 told the conference in @entity66 that mr @entity2 was ‘ shamefully neglecting ’ children , and his reforms would damage education , leaving morale at ‘ rock bottom ’			0
she added : ‘ in 2013 , every aspect of the curriculum you teach , the qualifications you prepare children to take , is under attack and review			0
’ ‘ @entity2 and sir @entity11 are like @entity78 , with a pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system and the teachers who work within it			1
’ the union ’s survey of 996 members on mr @entity2 ’s performance found 91 per cent rated him a ‘ fail ’			0
three - quarters criticised his curriculum revisions , which focus on basic maths and @entity92 and a chronological approach to history			0
@entity10 general secretary @entity64 said @entity2 and sir @entity11 pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system changes to gcses and a-levels , such as ditching modules in favour of final exams , are also unpopular			1
meanwhile , 60 per cent thought chief schools inspector sir @entity2 should be on ‘ special measures ’			1
the @entity35 and @entity36 last week announced strikes beginning on june 27 and culminating in a national strike before @entity108			0
they have said they will postpone them if mr @entity2 attends constructive talks and delays introducing performance - related pay			0
days later , 100 left - wing academics wrote to two national papers claiming pupils were doomed to ‘ failure and demoralisation ’ under the proposed curriculum , which is out for consultation until next month			0
an @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ sir @entity2 has said from the outset any provision that is less than good is not acceptable			2
that ’s a tough message , especially for those schools and colleges that have been coasting			0
’ a @entity126 spokesman said : ‘ we need to make sure we have an education system that is robust and rigorous			0
this ambition is surely something the @entity10 should be supporting			1

@entity10 condemns @entity7 and chief inspector sir @entity11
accuse pair of being like ' @entity78 ' in attacking teachers ' work
