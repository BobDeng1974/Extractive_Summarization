@entity0 tallied up 19 points as the in - form fly - half masterminded @entity5 's 24 - 11 @entity4 derby win over @entity6 at the @entity7			1
despite being on the back foot for much of the first half , @entity5 led 9 - 6 at the break thanks to three @entity12 penalties - the last of them coming after a yellow card for @entity6 's @entity14			1
the @entity15 should have been in front at that stage , especially given the injury - enforced departure of @entity5 captain @entity20 and some passive home defending			0
two penalties from the fit - again @entity23 had given them an early lead			0
@entity0 tallied up 19 points as the in - form fly - half masterminded @entity5 's 24 - 11 derby win over @entity6 the visitors fell further behind following an opportunist @entity0 try in the 42nd minute , before prop @entity30 's first touchdown in @entity6 colours cut the gap to 16 - 11			1
but @entity0 's fourth successful penalty , coupled with a deserved late try from man - of - the - match @entity35 , saw @entity5 bounce back impressively from last week 's disappointing defeat to @entity37			1
crisp passing from scrum half @entity23 saw @entity6 make early headway , @entity14 tearing through midfield and @entity5 required a terrific @entity42 turnover to relieve the pressure			1
@entity5 enjoyed some attacking phases before @entity14 's bone - crunching tackle on @entity46 and follow - up by @entity47 saw @entity23 go for goal from his own half			0
his well - struck kick came back off the crossbar			0
the @entity52 made amends two minutes later , splitting the posts from just inside the @entity5 half , before @entity0 responded in the 21st minute following a weaving run from excellent centre @entity57			1
@entity6 fired back with some potent midfield play as @entity60 and @entity61 grew in influence			2
@entity5 were pinged for not rolling away and @entity23 restored his side 's three - point advantage			0
@entity35 dives over the line to score @entity5 's second try of the afternoon at the @entity7 with a hamstring tweak forcing @entity69 ' late withdrawal before kick - off , @entity5 suffered a second back - row setback with the very rare sight of @entity20 going off injured with a shoulder injury			1
@entity0 lifted @entity5 spirits with a levelling penalty past the half hour mark , the dancing feet of @entity57 again outfoxing the @entity6 defence initially			1
but @entity5 enjoyed some welcome territory approaching half - time , with the penalties beginning to stack up against the visitors			2
@entity14 needlessly dived in off his feet to take out scrum half @entity83 and following the @entity6 lock 's sin - binning , @entity0 converted from in front of the posts			1
a left wing raid by @entity0 and @entity90 , coupled with a strong @entity91 carry near the posts , had 14 - man @entity6 under immediate pressure in the second period			2
crucially , they switched off at a five - metre penalty			0
@entity0 feigned a kick to touch , instead tapping it and rolling out of a @entity98 tackle to touch down			0
@entity5 's talisman added the conversion but @entity102 's charges created a well - worked try seven minutes later , tighthead @entity30 driving over to the right of the posts with support from fellow @entity107			2
@entity23 was unable to convert at 16 - 11 and after @entity109 went close during a power - packed spell of carrying , @entity0 's reliable right boot put eight points between the sides			0
@entity23 was wide and short with a left - sided penalty entering the final quarter , and @entity6 's challenge gradually petered out			0
@entity5 duly closed out their fifth successive victory over their provincial rivals with a try from flanker @entity119 , who burst on to @entity123 's short pass to go over in the left corner .			0

@entity0 tallied 19 points for @entity5 against @entity6
@entity35 also scored as they bounced back from defeat to @entity37
@entity30 scored a try for the visitors in the @entity4 derby
