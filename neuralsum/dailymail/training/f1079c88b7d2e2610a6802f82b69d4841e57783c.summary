@entity0 has spent 38 years clinging to the notion mother knows best			1
clutching a green and white shirt in the @entity4 at @entity5 it was time for a rethink			1
a qualified teacher , the @entity7 dovetailed his career as a defender at @entity11 with a full - time education			1
the assumption was the football would never amount to anything			2
‘ my mother said that i could never make a living from football , ’ he explained			2
‘ so i needed an education			2
up for the challenge : newly - appointed @entity22 manager @entity0 speaks during a press conference smile for the cameras : @entity22 chief executive @entity25 ( left ) unveils @entity0 as the new manager ‘ she finally said to me when i was coming here yesterday “ okay , i was wrong … " ' his mother is not alone in being confounded by her son ’s appointment as the 18th manager of @entity22			1
former coach of unfashionable @entity33 , @entity0 is an unexpected arrival			1
former @entity36 striker @entity35 describes the choice as ‘ underwhelming ’			2
to those who expected @entity41 or @entity42 to be standing on @entity43 yesterday , scarf raised , that is a view with some traction			2
facing the media : @entity0 and @entity25 speak to journalists at a press conference at @entity5 yet @entity0 cut an impressive and sure - footed figure , combining quiet confidence and conviction with humility			1
on social media and beyond @entity22 supporters are broadly supportive			1
many were uninspired by @entity41 and @entity42 as options and praise their club for ‘ thinking outside the box ’			2
to others the new man is simply the ‘ cheap option ’			2
it ’s undeniable that @entity62 a risky choice			2
he has never managed in the @entity65 but will be expected to negotiate three rounds of qualifying within six weeks			2
failure will place him under immediate and sustained pressure			2
how a @entity71 coach with no experience of @entity74 football will cope with the demands and pressure of @entity22 is the million dollar question			1
at @entity33 the average crowd was 6000			1
at @entity22 they will be ten times that on @entity82 nights			1
this is a club where managers with greater experience than @entity0 have been chewed up and spat out like old tobacco			1
‘ i have been in football for many , many years , ’ responded the new man			2
‘ i have been a manager now for seven years in @entity33			1
new man in town : @entity0 waves to the supporters as he arrives at @entity5 driven in : @entity0 sits in the back seat of a car as he arrives at @entity5 ‘ the difference here is the atmosphere and i ca n’t say how i ’m going to react to that - but i know i am a quick learner and that ’s the most important thing			1
‘ you have to learn from experiences , and develop , and that ’s what i want			2
i have to be humble			0
‘ you can ask me questions about @entity82 - can i deal with it ? - we ’ll see			0
but i ’m a quick learner			0
‘ i just have to look around me and use my energy on the most important thing and that ’s the product , what ’s happening on the pitch			0
all around , if the product is good then good things will come from that			0
’ unarguably , he delivered a strong product at his last club			0
appointed head coach of @entity33 at 32 , @entity0 took a club described as the @entity117 of @entity7 football from 11th place in the league to their first title in 43 years			1
but in an insular landscape like @entity124 people are already racking their brains for examples of @entity7 managers succeeding in @entity74 football			1
revealed : a picture of the new @entity22 third kit for next season was leaked on @entity132 @entity133 failed at @entity134			1
@entity137 failed at @entity138 and @entity139 was unable to keep @entity140 afloat in the @entity141			0
‘ i do n’t go around thinking that i am bringing all of @entity7 with me , ’ shrugged the latest man to have a go			1
‘ but i know the @entity7 people want me to succeed			1
‘ i have my own way of thinking about the job			0
i do n’t know what other @entity7 have done			1
in @entity124 not everyone is the same			0
i will do everything i can to succeed and i hope that will help @entity7 as well			1
’ the expectation is that a @entity153 would replace @entity154			0
@entity41 met major shareholder @entity155			0
when the box office options ruled themselves out @entity0 emerged as a very different candidate			1
the @entity7 is also a prototype of how people imagine @entity25 ’s perfect @entity22 manager			1
his salary will be manageable			0
he worked with a budget at @entity33 , he developed young players and he understood the need to sell			1
big job : @entity0 ( left ) will replace @entity154 at @entity22 after the @entity166 quit @entity25 says he is a ‘ good fit ’ for the @entity22 model and was always in the club ’s thinking			1
last winter @entity0 turned down @entity171 because the job did n’t feel right			1
‘ i had the feeling i was wanted , it felt different , ’ he said			0
‘ it is the philosophy and the values and you feel you can be a part of it			0
i did n’t say @entity171 was bad at that - but i felt ready here and that this is the right step			0
’ @entity0 also had the all - important @entity155 seal of approval after a meeting early this week			1
‘ it was a very good meeting , ’ said the @entity7			1
‘ i could have left the room after three minutes because he had already read me			0
‘ he has unbelievable knowledge and how he ’s putting things together , so i have big respect for him			0
’ at first @entity22 saw @entity0 as a possible assistant manager			1
@entity154 confirmed as much in an interview yesterday , saying he was asked to consider the @entity7 as a possible replacement when @entity194 left			1
no go : @entity196 assistant manager @entity42 asked not to be considered for the @entity22 job some will ask how a coach regarded as a potential @entity199 can become the main man so swiftly , but it hardly matters now			1
@entity194 ’s replacement will now be a scot , with @entity204 the leading candidate			0
intriguingly , rumour has it that @entity204 and @entity22 skipper @entity208 have an uneasy relationship from their days at @entity211			1
but @entity0 sees the need for a @entity124 assistant who knows his way around @entity215 without a sat nav and will meet other candidates as well			2
he has no intention of importing his @entity33 players and staff en masse			2
‘ it is really important to have people who are from @entity124 and from @entity22 , ’ he admitted			2
‘ you never know what will happen , maybe foreign people or players will come			0
but there are a lot of good people working in @entity124			0
’ he speaks in flawless @entity231 , but also speaks @entity233 fluently			0
a father of 14 - year - old twin daughters he is a keen student of the game , touring continental clubs – @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 – to enhance his coaching experience			0
backing : predecessor @entity154 has backed @entity0 's credentials after he came highly recommended the @entity245 trip proved pivotal			2
@entity22 sources say the @entity231 club recommended the @entity7 and while in @entity231 he travelled north to take in his one and only @entity22 match			1
‘ i was here for the @entity251 game			0
i went to see the @entity251 under - 19s and then i went to the main match , too , ’ he revealed			0
‘ the day before i was at @entity241 - @entity254 , under - 19s and the first teams			0
that was an unbelievable experience , to be here			0
‘ i almost never take pictures - but i filmed that			0
so many times i have looked at that film , when ‘ @entity263 ’ was sung before the match			0
‘ at that point i did n’t know that this was going to happen			0
i ’ve been a @entity239 fan – but i think the atmosphere is much better here			0
‘ when i ’m driving the car home at night , i get goosebumps when i think about it			0
it ’s fun to win , but the way to win is the most fun thing			0
‘ i hope i can sit in my car driving to my apartment somewhere near here and feel that emotion many times			0
