@entity1 idea : @entity2 says that @entity4 ministers may join forces with @entity6 in a @entity8 vote calling for a mansion tax @entity4 ministers may join forces with @entity6 in a @entity8 vote calling for a £ 2million mansion tax , @entity2 revealed yesterday			1
the business secretary ’s provocative suggestion – which could split the @entity16 – came as it emerged that the @entity4 are considering widening the scope of their mansion tax proposals to include second homes and buy - to - let properties			1
this would mean that voters would be taxed on property portfolios worth above £ 2million and could dramatically widen the number of households liable to the annual 1 per cent levy			0
the policy is seen as being helpful for the @entity4 in the @entity28 where the party is traditionally strong and which has a high number of second homes			0
according to the @entity35 , 1.57million people living in @entity33 and @entity34 have a second address in another local authority area			0
mr @entity2 , seen as a likely broker of a future @entity39 , suggested his party ’s mps would be happy to ditch their loyalty to the @entity16 to vote for their cherished policy			1
a form of mansion tax was adopted last week by @entity46 as a way of funding @entity6 ’s sudden commitment to reintroducing the 10p tax band for the lower paid			1
but mr @entity2 said it was ‘ a policy whose time has come ’ and welcomed indications that the @entity6 leader had ‘ seen sense ’ on the issue			2
mr @entity46 has said he will stage a @entity8 vote on the tax in the coming weeks in an attempt to split the @entity16 and increase pressure for it to be brought in			2
if @entity40 vote with @entity6 the government could suffer a rare , and highly embarrassing , @entity8 defeat			0
it would not automatically result in the introduction of the new tax , but would damage already tense relations between the @entity16 partners			0
policy : a form of mansion tax was adopted last week by @entity46 as a way of funding @entity72 s sudden commitment to reintroducing the 10p tax band for the lower paid mr @entity2 said his party ’s support would depend on mr @entity46 being ‘ sensible ’ about the idea and not playing ‘ political games ’ by dragging in wider issues , such as @entity6 ’s new plan to partly reintroduce the 10p tax rate using the proceeds of the mansion tax			1
asked if the @entity4 would support @entity6 in a @entity8 vote , mr @entity2 told @entity83 : ‘ it depends entirely how they phrase it			1
if it is purely a statement of support for the principle of a mansion tax i ’m sure my colleagues would want to support it			2
’ @entity4 proposals for a mansion tax would place an annual 1 per cent levy on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
owners would pay the tax on the value of their home above £ 2million			0
now , a policy paper prepared for the party leadership suggests it could be extended to cover total property holdings , potentially dragging in many families with second homes			0
last week , @entity6 said 70,000 families could be hit by a levy on properties worth £ 2million or more			0
but if it was extended to cover those with buy - to - let investments and second homes it could hit many more voters			0
mr @entity2 played down suggestions that the tax would be extended , saying the priority was to get it introduced			2
@entity115 has vetoed repeated @entity4 calls to impose a mansion tax , warning that it would be unfair on people who happen to live in wealthy areas .			1
