it was n't meant to be like this			0
after a record - breaking @entity3 points haul last season , @entity2 were supposed to pick up where they left off and mount a serious challenge for the top four			1
however , things have not gone to plan at @entity10			0
saturday 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity12 left the @entity2 closer to the relegation zone than those coveted @entity15 places			1
@entity2 were expected to mount a serious challenge for the top four this season but have struggled for form the @entity2 lost away at @entity12 on saturday and are closer to the relegation zone than the top four after a record - breaking @entity3 points haul last season , @entity21 were n't expecting to struggle @entity2 manager @entity23 has changed the entire outlook of the football club with his positive attitude going into @entity28 last season , the @entity27 had lost just one game and were two points off top spot			1
this season , @entity2 have already lost six matches and have won just five times in the @entity3			2
it 's hard to pin - point exactly what has caused @entity2 's form to drop so considerably over one summer			2
second - season syndrome for the manager ? the @entity27 ' @entity42 campaign ? not enough new additions during the last transfer window ? whatever the reason , put simply , @entity2 have n't reached the high standards the club set themselves during @entity23 's first year on @entity48			1
@entity2 played some scintilating football last season but have struggled to live up to the high standards set 2014 - 15 ( after 17 games ) league position : 10th points from top spot : 18 wins : 5 draws : 6 defeats : 6 goals for : 27 goals conceded : 27 goal difference : 0 2013 - 14 ( after 17 games ) league position : 5th points from top spot : 2 wins : 9 draws : 7 defeats : 1 goals for : 29 goals conceded : 16 goal difference : @entity71 one problem - a season - long one - has been @entity2 's defence			1
conceding 10 goals in their first three fixtures was an unexpected setback and the season has failed to lift off since			0
the occasional clean sheet has been kept but the performances of an ageing backline have been called into question			0
the @entity27 ' back five - so miserly in past seasons - has looked a shadow of itself and not at all confident while @entity84 has failed to repeat his @entity86 heroics			0
costly individuals errors - out of @entity23 's control - were the main contributing factor for @entity2 's poor start but the club are yet to recover and languish in mid-table			1
@entity2 lost 6 - 3 to @entity94 at the end of august - conceding ten goals in their opening three league fixtures @entity2 keeper @entity84 looks on as @entity99 heads into his own net to give @entity12 the lead @entity2 's ageing backline have struggled for much of the season and appear to be short of confidence goalkeeper @entity84 has failed to produce the form he showed for the @entity106 during the @entity86 in @entity107 meanwhile , at the other end of the pitch , the goals have flowed as freely as before but unlike last year , loan star @entity99 now has a £ 28million price tag to live up to			1
@entity115 to the club moving forward , it was essential @entity2 made the @entity117 's move from @entity94 a permanent one but the striker has much to prove			2
the potential to net 20 goals a season is what @entity99 brings to @entity23 's side but the 21 - year - old must do more to warrant the massive fee @entity2 paid for his services			1
for such a giant of a forward , @entity99 has lacked any real aerial threat , struggled to hold the ball up and , while he still finds the back of the net , his general play has been lethargic			0
@entity99 scores plenty of goals but must do more to warrant the huge fee @entity2 paid for his services @entity99 adhered himself to the @entity2 faithful last season and struck up a special relationship with @entity23 @entity99 's general play has been lethargic this season and , for such a giant , has lacked any real aerial threat the blue half of @entity48 attacked with vigour and purpose last season but the scintillating football which delighted the @entity2 faithful has been missing this term			1
@entity23 has failed to find a real balance among his front four this term and must find a formation which suits the vast array of attacking talent at his disposal			0
too often this season , @entity23 has stuck with @entity99 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 as his front four , but all prefer to play centrally			2
lacking any natural width , it appears @entity23 is selecting his best individuals rather than his best @entity163 pegs in round holes			0
@entity157 ( left ) and @entity158 ( right ) have both been forced to play out wide on occasion this term @entity2 forward @entity156 speaks to @entity167 during @entity2 's sixth defeat of the season having arrived at @entity2 from @entity171 in the summer of 2013 to replace @entity172 , @entity23 's positive attitude changed the entire outlook of the football club during his first 12 months			1
however , this constantly cheery outlook - even after the worst performances - is proving a gripe for some supporters			0
rather than praising the players ' energy , work - rate and commitment to the cause , the club 's support would much rather the @entity179 sometimes admitted : ' we were n't good enough			0
' it must be said , @entity23 did concede following the defeat at @entity190 's : ' we are to blame for the defeat			2
we were a little bit soft , done too easily with balls into the box			0
it ’s disappointing the way we defended our box , ' and will have at least satisfied supporters with his honesty			0
@entity2 boss @entity23 admitted his team were too soft and defended poorly during the defeat to @entity12 struggling on home soil , the @entity42 has provided some solace - @entity2 playing some blistering attacking football to overcome @entity204 , flying - high in the @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 to reach the last 32 of the competition - and proves the @entity2 still have it ; somewhere			1
however , @entity2 fans are desperate to see the club perform to it 's maximum potential both at home and abroad			2
luckily , the games come thick and fast during this busy @entity28 schedule and provide @entity2 with a great opportunity to kick start their stuttering season going into 2015			0
after last year 's achievements , @entity23 must show his true credentials as manager by arresting the slide			0
@entity2 must act and take advantage of the festive period to save their @entity3 season			1
@entity225 is mobbed after scoring a late equaliser against @entity227 - one of few highlights this season @entity2 have found solace in the @entity42 , reaching the last 32 with a string of impressive displays			1

@entity2 were expected to challenge the top four but have struggled
the @entity2 were beaten 3 - 0 away at @entity12 on saturday
@entity2 have impressed in the @entity42 and reached the last 32
@entity23 's men must improve to rescue @entity3 season
