gps handing out antibiotics to placate demanding patients is leading to a rise in resistant superbugs that could send medicine ' back to the @entity6 ' family doctors are needlessly doling out antibiotics to ‘ placate ’ patients , an influential group of @entity8 warns today			1
the practice of gps using the drugs ‘ simply to achieve a placebo effect ’ is fuelling a growth in antibiotic resistance , according to a report by the @entity19			0
the @entity20 reported last week how the country ’s chief medical officer , dame @entity21 , said that patients pressing gps for antibiotics were part of the problem			1
she also said she will die from a routine infection if she undergoes a hip replacement operation 20 years from now			0
another expert said gps were issuing the drugs to up to 90 per cent of the patients they see with distressing symptoms – whether or not they would be any use			1
the problem is so serious that @entity37 last week said superbugs ’ resistance to antibiotics could send medicine ‘ back to the @entity6 ’			1
now he is being urged by the committee to back his words with ‘ decisive and urgent action ’ before it is too late to stem a tide of infections that can not be treated			2
the @entity8 ’ report says : ‘ for too long , antibiotics have been used as if they were a bottomless pit of cure - all miracle treatments			1
‘ antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and other diseases that are not caused by bacteria and the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics has contributed to the acceleration of antibiotic resistance			2
’ the committee warned in particular of gps using antibiotics as a placebo to make patients think they are getting effective treatments , even when the drugs have no medical impact			1
@entity68 , chairman of the committee which has completed a seven - month inquiry , said : ‘ antibiotic resistance can not be entirely prevented , but it is a problem made worse by inappropriate use and poor stewardship of antibiotics in healthcare and farming			2
about 35 ¿ million prescriptions for antibiotics are are given out a year by @entity61 in @entity80			1
the number has risen 30 per cent since 2000 as 5,000 people a year die from resistant bacteria ‘ we heard concerns , for instance , that antibiotics are often prescribed by @entity61 simply to achieve a placebo effect or placate patients with distressing symptoms			1
' in farming , meanwhile , we suspect that antibiotics may be routinely used on healthy animals			2
’ dr @entity95 of the @entity96 told the committee that @entity61 were issuing antibiotics to up to nine out of ten patients , the report says			1
antibiotics , designed to fight bacteria , are routinely given to treat viral infections such as colds and flu			2
while patients may leave the surgery happy , the prescription will do little to fight their illness			2
about 35 million prescriptions for antibiotics are dispensed every year by @entity61 in @entity80			1
the number has risen 30 per cent since 2000 , according to @entity113 figures			0
meanwhile 5,000 people die from antibiotic - resistant infections in @entity80 every year			0
the @entity113 has brought down rates of two of the most serious superbugs – @entity118 and @entity119 – through a huge awareness campaign and improved hygiene in hospitals			0
but new threats have emerged to replace them , including @entity127 , cases of which increased 30 per cent between 2005 and 2009			0
increased cleanlines in hospitals has brought rates of @entity118 ( pictured ) and @entity119 infection down but new strains have emerged to replace them , such as @entity127 the committee report says : ‘ we found it difficult to understand how the government has failed to act decisively to address the issue of inappropriate prescription of antibiotics			1
’ @entity141 has asked the government to put antibiotic resistance on the national risk register , ranking it alongside a large - scale terrorist attack			0
she has warned that without action we may return to a ‘ 19th - century environment ’ in which routine operations are potentially deadly			0
she told the committee : ‘ when i need a new hip in 20 years , i will die of a routine infection because we have run out of antibiotics			0
’ mr @entity37 announced last week that @entity153 , former chief economist at @entity154 , will lead an international group of experts aiming to spur drug development			1
but mr @entity68 said : ‘ publishing strategies and announcing reviews is not the same as dealing with the problem			0
‘ what we really need from @entity142 right now is decisive and urgent action to prevent antibiotics from being given to people and animals who do not need them			0
’ the committee says greater public awareness is needed to ease pressure on @entity61 to dish out the drugs .			0

@entity8 warn doctors are handing out too many prescriptions for antibiotics
family doctors giving out medicine unnecessarily to placate patients
*over-use* is leading to rise in superbug strains resistant to antibiotics
@entity37 warned bugs could send medicine ' back to the @entity6 '
