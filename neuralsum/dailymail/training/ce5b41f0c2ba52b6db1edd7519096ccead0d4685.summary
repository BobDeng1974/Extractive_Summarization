the morning mist had yielded to soothing autumn sunshine when @entity2 came trampling off the 18th green at @entity4			1
he was in high good humour , having concluded an excellent round of 68 with an eagle at the last			1
he shook a flock of hands , posed for a stream of ‘ selfies ’ and signed his name on a frantic flutter of books and caps			1
and he remembered to smile his thanks every time somebody said : ‘ good luck next week			2
’ next week : it was at the forefront of every mind , especially in the valley where @entity24 reclaimed @entity26 ’s pot by a single point just four years ago			1
@entity2 has the drive and motivation to succeed next week in his ninth @entity30 with @entity24 @entity2 played his full part in that victory ; indeed , his glassy - eyed grin as he lurched from the clubhouse balcony is a vivid memory of that happy monday			1
but those antics are in the past : the future begins at @entity39 , on friday			1
for the past few days , @entity4 has been staging the @entity40			1
it is an admirable tournament in its own right , but this week it has been reduced to a prelude , an appetiser for the main event			2
inevitably , mutterings of ‘ next week ’ have rippled around the galleries whenever the four @entity24 representatives were in action			1
of that quartet , @entity50 endured a calamitous opening day and made a premature departure			2
but @entity55 has been stolidly consistent , @entity54 has been impressively productive , and @entity2 has been unfailingly interesting			1
@entity2 is -3 after three rounds of the @entity40 at @entity4 , 11 shots off leader @entity58 having played in eight @entity59 , and having helped to win six of them , he understands just what the event represents			1
‘ i always say that only golfers used to watch the @entity30 , ’ he says			1
‘ now people who are interested in sport watch it			2
it ’s not just golfers			2
i have people coming up to me saying they ’ve never picked a club up in their life , but they thought the last day of the past @entity30 was the most enthralling day of sport			1
they could n’t get off the couch			2
they had things to do but they were just captivated by the whole thing			2
‘ i ’m not a @entity77 fan , but i was captivated by the second half in @entity79 when they came back from 3 - 0 down ( in 2005 )			1
the @entity30 has been the same for non-golfers			1
’ since his 1997 debut , @entity2 has earned 21 points and been a key man in six victorious @entity30 teams			1
he has been on the losing side twice			2
@entity88 singles 8 3 5 0 foursomes 15 7 4 4 fourballs 14 8 4 2 total 37 18 13 6 he is acutely aware of how the contest brought him a kind of redemption as a golfer			2
having led the @entity24 merit list in 2000 , he took time off to reshape his swing and drifted out to 75th in 2002			1
but in the 2002 match at @entity101 , he joined with @entity102 in a stunningly successful partnership which brought them three wins out of four			2
from there on , he moved back to the heights he had once commanded , all the way to world no 1			2
he remembers it warmly : ‘ @entity102 helped me a lot			1
he was the perfect partner for me			2
it gave my career a kickstart			2
‘ this could be the same			0
any time you play well under pressure , and next week will be the most intense pressure you will ever experience , it makes a difference			0
‘ it was nice to play well and not let anybody down , because i had n’t been playing particularly well going into that @entity30			1
but it also triggered something in my head that made me realise i was still a good player and i could still do it under pressure			0
i guess i owe the @entity30 something for helping to restore my belief			1
’ the @entity4 crowd instinctively embraces @entity2 , as if recognising a man who suffers and celebrates just like them			1
for all his experience and wealth , accumulated through two decades as a tour player , he retains a touch of @entity138			0
when he announced that he had shed 23lbs in three weeks , he seemed rather proud of his achievement			0
nobody was cruel enough to enquire how a top sportsman can carry so much excess baggage			0
he moves around the course with an aldermanic waddle , his face a mirror of his mood			0
the good shots bring a flashing beam , the indifferent efforts the darkest scowl			0
you sense that the game remains important to him , that the drive for perfection is intact , no matter that he had to rely on a wild card for @entity30 selection			1
you also sense that his influence on the young players may well prove crucial next week			0
he understands what is expected : ‘ any time it ’s your first @entity30 , you will need a helping hand , an arm around the shoulder , no matter how old you are			1
the intensity and atmosphere is the difference			0
the discipline is just the same			0
’ @entity2 celebrates in 2012 with @entity173 as the @entity175 triumph in the last @entity30 he adds : ‘ you put a tee in the ground with a bit of grass on it			1
it ’s the same little white ball you play all year , the same driver behind it			0
nothing ’s changed , except the 25,000 people that feel like they are on top of you , all screaming ’			0
he also appreciates the team dynamic			0
‘ even when games are being lost on the course , if someone wins a couple of holes and goes from three down to one down , that can spur people on to come back in their game , ’ he says			0
‘ i think it was @entity198 in front of me against @entity200 , and @entity198 was five down or something and he got it back to two down and you think “ oh , @entity204 ’s on a comeback now ” , and it lifts you , even though he was losing his match			0
‘ that ’s what you try and impress on everybody			0
if you ’re losing , keep sticking in and strange things can happen			0
’ the @entity24 team celebrate their against all odds victory in 2012 in the so - called miracle of @entity216 an air of contentment sits well on @entity2 , especially on this softly successful day in @entity219			1
next week will be quite different			0
it will be a genuine sporting ordeal			0
in such circumstances , can he actually enjoy the game he clearly loves ? he considers			0
‘ there are moments when you can laugh and enjoy it			0
just looking at the crowd and appreciating that there are 20,000 people lined up on the bank beside the 16th cheering for you			0
there ’s no experience in golf that ’s anywhere close to the atmosphere of a @entity30			1
’ saturday evening found him at the driving range ; working , concentrating , seeking that critical edge			0
sunday he will enjoy another joust with @entity4			0
then the circus pitches tent in @entity39			1
next week , as the crowds kept repeating			0
next week , with the great game to be played , and history waiting to be made .			0
