‘ on the surface , @entity6 provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection , ’ said lead researchers dr @entity17 , a psychologist at the @entity19			2
‘ but rather than enhance well - being , we found that @entity6 use predicts the opposite result - it undermines it			1
’ @entity27 carried out earlier this year at the @entity28 suggested @entity6 friends are no substitute for the real thing			2
it found people are happier and laugh 50 per cent more when talking face - to - face with friends or via webcam than when they use social networking sites			0
and the current study backed these findings , with participants who had direct interactions with other people feeling better over time			0
in contrast , the more individuals used @entity6 during the period , the greater the reduction in their life satisfaction levels			1
‘ this is a result of critical importance because it goes to the very heart of the influence that social networks may have on people ’s lives , ’ said co-author @entity48 , a cognitive neuroscientist at the @entity19			0
