a house - sized asteroid has been spotted heading for @entity2 - and will pass just 160,000km from us today			1
called asteroid 2014 @entity5 , it is around 15m wide - and was only spotted for the first time yesterday			1
experts say there is no risk from the flyby , which will happen at around 4:12pm est. called asteroid 2014 @entity5 , it is around 15m wide - and was only spotted for the first time yesterday			1
the asteroid is the brightest object in the image			2
experts say there is no risk from the flyby , which will happen at around 9:12pm @entity20			1
the 15 meter wide space rock will miss our planet at a distance of about 160,000 km ( 0.4 lunar distances ) at 9:12 p.m. @entity20			1
the asteroid was discovered saturday and despite passing so close to @entity2 , few if any of us will see the flyby with our eyes in a telescope			1
the house - sized asteroid 2014 @entity30 will pass between the @entity2 and the @entity32			1
the 15 meter wide space rock will miss our planet at a distance of about 160,000 km ( 0.4 lunar distances ) at 9:12 p.m. @entity20			1
the asteroid was discovered saturday			1
despite passing so close to @entity2 , few if any of us will see the flyby - even with a telescope			1
experts say it was no surprise the asteroid was not spotted until now			1
' with 90 % of near - @entity2 asteroids larger than 0.6 miles ( 1 km ) discovered , surveys are now focusing on finding 90 % of objects larger than 460 feet ( 140 - m ) , ' amateur astronomer @entity45 wroes on his blog			1
' we have to take it a step at a time because the total number of near - @entity2 asteroids is in the millions			1
' that 's why objects like 2014 @entity30 pop up regularly in surveys each month			2
' at brightest , 2014 @entity30 will only reach magnitude +16 , as it zips from @entity57 constellation through @entity58			0
the asteroid , back in 2012 visited @entity60 at a distance of about 8 mln km , and will again approach the @entity2 on feb. 12 , 2018			1
the @entity62 will offer a live , online event sharing real - time images of 2014 @entity30 with live commentary by their scientific staff			0
the stream , starting at 7:00 p.m. @entity20 , will be available at : @entity70			2
none of the known potentially hazardous asteroids is on a collision course with our planet , although astronomers are finding new ones all the time			0
these images were taken of comet c / 2013 @entity79 by @entity82 's @entity81 on 19 october 2014 during the comet 's close flyby of @entity60 and the spacecraft			2
it is the highest - resolution image of a comet that heralds from the @entity88 at the edge of the solar system ever taken it comes just says after a remarkable once - in - a - million - year event saw a comet hurtle past @entity60			0
after @entity94 snapped an image from the surface , an image from one of the @entity60 orbiters has been released			0
and astronomers on @entity2 also managed to capture the extremely rare cosmic event			2
the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) camera on @entity82 â€™s @entity81 ( @entity81 ) was used to capture views of comet c / 2013 @entity79			0
the amazing images are the highest - resolution views ever acquired of a comet coming from the @entity88 at the fringes of the solar system			0
and the images have been used to estimate that the nucleus of the comet is roughly half the size originally thought , making it about a quarter of a mile ( 0.4km ) wide			2
this image of @entity115 was taken by astronomers @entity117 and @entity118 using the @entity119 in @entity120			0
the comet is the blue - ish object towards the middle of the picture , with its tail seen streaking backwards			0
@entity60 is the bright sun - like object in the middle , overexposed to reveal the comet the @entity102 camera on the @entity81 acquired images of this comet from a minimum distance of about 86,000 miles ( 138,000 kilometers ) , yielding a scale of about 453 feet ( 138 meters ) per pixel			0
another image taken by @entity117 using the @entity119 in @entity120 reveals the comet and its tail as it approaches @entity60			0
the amazing picture sees @entity60 look almost as bright as the sun as the image had to be overexposed in order to reveal the comet			0
' we 'd planned our observations for weeks in advance , scripting telescope code and setting up observation plans , ' mr @entity117 told @entity148			0
' we shot hundreds of images of the comet and @entity60 with different exposure times , and had some technical challenges to overcome , but we 're delighted with the end result , which was part of a global collaboration with both professional and amateur observers			0
' @entity155 is an educational outreach observatory , so this is great motivation also for the students ' @entity159 / 2013 @entity79 , also known as @entity79 , passed within about 87,000 miles ( 140,000 km ) of @entity60 , equivalent to about one - third of the distance between @entity2 and our moon			2
@entity82 confirmed yesterday that all three of its @entity60 orbiters survived the event unscathed , while @entity166 and @entity167 's spacecraft were also unaffected .			0

15m wide space rock will pass at around 9:12pm @entity20 ( 4:12pm est )
asteroid was only discovered on sunday
experts say there is no risk from flyby between @entity2 and the @entity32
asteroid will *revisit* @entity2 in 2018
