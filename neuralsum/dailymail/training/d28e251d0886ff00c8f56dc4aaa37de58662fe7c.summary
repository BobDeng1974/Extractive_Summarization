begging for forgiveness : @entity1 has issued a grovelling apology over his controversial new @entity4 interview @entity1 has made a grovelling apology after saying @entity6 is a ' town run by @entity7 ' in his now infamous @entity4 interview			1
the @entity10 star made the comments as he claimed @entity12 was being unfairly ostracised over his anti-semitic rants , while also complaining that political correctness ' is c * * p. ' and after he was attacked over his choice of words by the @entity18 , he issued his fawning apology , in which he hailed @entity7 as ' the chosen people			1
' in a statement addressing the ' gentlemen ' of the organisation , which was printed on @entity24 , he wrote : ' i am deeply remorseful that comments i recently made in the @entity27 were offensive to many @entity7 people			0
' upon reading my comments in print - i see how insensitive they may be , and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype			2
' anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable , including my own words on the matter			0
' the 56 - year - old @entity40 star went further as he tried to distance himself from his statements in the forthcoming edition of the pornography magazine , insisting he is a huge admirer of the contribution @entity7 people have made to showbusiness			0
he said : ' if , during the interview , i had been asked to elaborate on this point i would have pointed out that i had just finished reading @entity51 ’s superb book about the @entity7 and @entity6 , @entity52 : how the @entity7 invented @entity6			1
' the fact is that our business , and my own career specifically , owes an enormous debt to that contribution			0
' i hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt , genuine , and that i have an enormous personal affinity for the @entity7 people in general , and those specifically in my life			0
' he then finished by begging for forgiveness , going as far as to say he is unworthy of using a @entity69 greeting meaning ' peace be upon you			0
' the working class actor , who is the son of a welder , said : '' the jewish people , persecuted thorough the ages , are the first to hear @entity77 ’s voice , and surely are the chosen people			0
' @entity1 , who is in the middle of promoting his forthcoming @entity10 film , caused outrage after claiming @entity12 is ' all right , ' despite the actor 's previous use of anti-semitic and racist epithets			1
he also claimed the current vogue of political correctness was rife with hypocrisy			0
the @entity98 star insisted : ' @entity12 is in a town that ’s run by @entity7 and he said the wrong thing because he ’s actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him - and does n’t need to feed him anymore because he ’s got enough dough			1
' he ’s like an outcast , a leper , you know ? '' but some @entity7 guy in his office somewhere has n’t turned and said , “ that f * * * ing kraut ” or “ f * * * those @entity111 , ” whatever it is ? we all hide and try to be so politically correct			1
that 's what gets me			0
' @entity12 , 58 , made @entity117 slurs when he was arrested for suspected drink - driving in @entity119 in 2006 , two years after his film @entity120 was criticised for depicting @entity7 negatively			2
' he 's alright ' : @entity1 claimed ' everyone ' has used racial slurs like @entity12 and should forgive him his words prompted an angry backlash , with antisemitism group the @entity18 's national director @entity126 saying : ' he should know better than to repeat and give credence to tired anti-semitic tropes			1
' @entity12 ’s ostracization in @entity6 was not a matter of being " politically incorrect , " as mr. @entity1 suggests , but of paying the consequences for outing himself as a bigot and a hater			1
' it is disturbing that mr. @entity1 appears to have bought into mr. @entity12 ’s warped and prejudiced world view			1
' he also added the assertion @entity7 control @entity6 is , ' an anti-semitic stereotype based on the " @entity139 , " the 19th century anti-semitic forgery that suggested @entity7 conspire to control major industries such as banking and finance			2
' the apology is the latest piece of backpeddling from the @entity148 star 's camp , with his manager @entity149 earlier saying : ' this notion that he 's defending @entity12 and @entity151 is preposterous			2
@entity1 would not defend hate speech or any divisive speech			2
the piece lacked a kind of balance on that regard			0
' notorious : @entity12 has been an @entity6 outcast since his infamous drink - driving arrest in @entity119 in 2006			1

defended @entity12 's anti-semitic comments in now - infamous @entity4 interview
called his forced *exile* from @entity6 ' politically correct c * * p '
@entity1 was *blasted* by the @entity18
