it is such stuff as a football fan 's dreams are made on – being pulled from the crowd to replace an injured player and scoring a crucial last - minute goal			2
for 20 - year - old @entity8 , the dream came true when she was asked to pull on the @entity10 jersey as she sat in the stands watching the national women 's team play			1
miss @entity8 was a spectator at the game against @entity15 in which @entity10 , having already been hit by two late call - offs , suffered a series of injuries			1
when yet another player was carried off , with only ten minutes to go , miss @entity8 was summoned to the dressing room			1
great scot ! in boots two sizes too big @entity8 , wearing number 14 , bears down on goal before equalising for @entity10 against @entity15 she took to the pitch in borrowed boots two sizes too big – and three pairs of socks to ensure they stayed on – yet kept her nerve to score the equaliser as @entity10 trailed 2 - 1			1
miss @entity8 , of @entity34 , @entity35 , said : ' i was there for a day out with my friends and the next thing i know i 'm stepping on the park			1
i could n't believe it when i scored			0
' she has been playing football since she was three and has been with @entity46 since she was 11			0
she has played for the @entity10 under - 17 and under - 19 teams and had been helping out the full squad in training			2
incredible : @entity8 , pictured right , celebrates with teammate @entity52 after scoring the late equaliser in the @entity55 match last week miss @entity8 was then invited to the friendly at @entity58 's @entity57 last thursday ahead of two crucial @entity60 qualifiers against @entity61 and @entity62 later this month			1
she said : ' i was standing with my friends waiting on a cup of tea when the team administrator came up and asked if i had my boots with me			2
so she took me to the changing room and got me kitted out			0
' the shorts were way too big and baggy and i was wearing three pairs of socks			2
i must have looked ridiculous			0
' miss @entity8 , who studies sport at @entity75 , would not normally have been allowed to play – but the referee agreed to relax the rules as it was a friendly			1
big impact : after make her dramatic last gasp entry to the field of play @entity8 has everything to smile about @entity10 boss @entity84 said : ' @entity8 was training with the players during the week but she was n't in the squad – so we asked if she could play because we were a player short			1
i 'm very pleased with her – the first ever game with the a-squad and she scores			0
' @entity92 manager @entity91 said : ' i was n't aware @entity8 was even at the game			2
i was at work and got an email from someone at the game to say she 'd come on as a sub			0
as you can imagine , i was quite surprised			0
' for her to score the equaliser is fantastic – and it 's thoroughly deserved			0
' she works so hard and deserves the recognition			0
' miss @entity8 said : ' i want to finish university and find a rewarding career but a chance to play pro football is everything – that is the ultimate goal			1
' her mother @entity108 , 57 , said : ' we are so proud of her , she works so hard			0
' since she could walk , she has always had a ball at her feet			0
