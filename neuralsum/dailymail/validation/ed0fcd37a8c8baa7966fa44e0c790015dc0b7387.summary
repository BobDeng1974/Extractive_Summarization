since the @entity2 in 2011 , @entity1 have endured intermittent fighting , attempted coups and increasing violence but now , with @entity7 militiamen advancing on the beleaguered forces of president @entity9 in the second city of @entity11 , things look increasingly bleak			1
with the capital @entity13 also in the hands of the @entity16 - backed rebels , women and children are now on the front line of a conflict that , last night alone , saw an estimated 40 people perish after @entity23 war planes apparently bombed a refugee camp			1
now a haunting new set of photos has shed light on what @entity1 stands to lose , including a @entity30 minority that has lived in @entity1 - and neigbouring countries such as @entity33 and @entity23 - for thousands of years			1
under threat : these women were photographed in @entity36 , a town that fell to the @entity7 last summer and is now being targeted with air strikes front line : these girls live in @entity40 , a village in @entity7 controlled territory close to the @entity23 border fighting : this little girl was photographed close to the city of @entity46 which fell to the @entity7 militia yesterday the pictures , which were taken by @entity50 photographer @entity49 , show the country 's women and children going about their daily lives , whether chatting in the market or having their nails hennaed			1
but more than ever , their future looks uncertain with @entity23 troops massing on the border , @entity16 refusing to back down and nightly air strikes conducted by planes from @entity62 , the @entity63 , @entity33 and even @entity64			1
so far , most have been confined to the capital with @entity67 's international airport among the targets hit last night , along with an army camp in @entity70 and the @entity72 port of @entity73			2
' there were huge blazes in the mountains outside @entity13			0
it looks like they hit a missile depot and it was on fire for half an hour or so			0
then there was anti-aircraft fire until dawn , ' a @entity13 resident said			0
nevertheless , even before the @entity7 advance began , life was n't particularly easy for the women of @entity1			1
one third of girls are married off before the age of 18 according to @entity91 , with a handful marrying aged nine or 10			0
' many activists campaign for a minimum age for marriage but enforcing that in the remoter areas is difficult , ' explains @entity49 , a frequent visitor to @entity1			0
dangerous : @entity40 is currently in rebel hands but for the women who live there , little has changed so far restricted : for many women , life in @entity1 is restrictive			2
here , a woman is seen shopping accompanied by two male family members changing times : for these women , who live in the @entity1 capital , life has become increasingly dangerous since the 2011 @entity2 historic : these women live in historic @entity111 , a town built by the @entity113 dynasty in the 12th century			2
it was once popular with tourists ' @entity1 is a country where female genital mutilation ( @entity117 ) remains an issue , even though it has been officially outlawed			0
many girls miss out on education as well			0
' @entity9 's government had set a target of 90 per cent of girls in education by the end of 2015 but with the @entity7 and soldiers loyal to ousted president @entity127 now in control of most of the country , it 's a target that is unlikely to be hit			2
' convincing parents of the benefits of sending their daughters to school is difficult , ' adds @entity49			0
' many families in rural areas think it is a waste of money to educate a girl			0
' instead , they expect them to stay at home and cook or collect firewood and water			0
when they marry , the girls are expected do much the same			0
' despite strict rules that often mean that the only part of a @entity1 woman visible are a pair of hennaed hands , @entity49 says the same rules are not applied to foreign women who are regarded as ' a third sex ' in @entity1			2
' they do n't have to wear a veil or anything like that , although it is appreciated in some places , ' he says			0
' they are allowed to do everything , including eating and speaking with men			0
' when i walked through @entity67 with a girl wearing trousers , many @entity1 men came up to me and asked : " is it a man or a woman ? " ' trousers , unless with a long robe , are not supposed to be worn by women			1
' some do have more freedom , however , among them the bare - faced ladies of @entity46 and @entity174 close to @entity11			1
but with both towns falling to the @entity7 yesterday , their days of being allowed to do as they please could be numbered			2
traditional : women living in @entity40			0
because the village is so remote , fetching water means a daily trek to a well miles from home making a living : a lady carries water in a village just outside @entity186 while another battles a flooded wadi in @entity189 scorching : women living in the huge @entity192 province in central @entity1 often wear tall hats as extra protection from the sun decorative : the only adornment visible on most @entity1 women is a pair of hennaed hands education : many village women such as this one are not educated because their families see it as a waste of time , according to @entity49 the current round of fighting in @entity1 has pitted government forces led by president @entity9 against an @entity16 - backed rebel force made up of @entity7 and soldiers supporting former leader @entity127 who was ousted in 2012			1
supporting president @entity9 is an @entity214 coalition led by @entity23 and including @entity33 , @entity62 , @entity215 , the @entity63 and @entity64 among others			1
the @entity7 are from a @entity1 @entity218 sect and are allied to @entity16 , @entity23 's main regional rival			1
the @entity23 and other @entity221 countries in the region fear the advance of the @entity7 will ultimately threaten the world 's top oil exporter			2
much of the fighting is focused on the port city of @entity11 where president @entity9 is holed up amid bloody clashes with @entity7 forces			1
@entity11 is @entity9 's last stronghold in @entity1 and remains besieged despite a fifth day of air strikes aimed at checking the @entity7 advance			1
the @entity23 air strikes , part of an operation named @entity236 , may herald a full - blown invasion , with troops already massing on the @entity1 border			1
however , @entity240 reports that @entity242 officials say that @entity23 is reluctant to take the next step if at all possible			0
different life : not all @entity1 women live restricted lives			0
in @entity248 in @entity46 , close to @entity11 , women have similar powers to men overrun : residents of @entity46 such as this women have now been overwhelmed by @entity7 rebels who advanced into the city yesterday advance : soldiers from @entity1 units loyal to ousted president @entity127 pictured on the outskirts of @entity46 frightening : rebels in the @entity1 capital @entity67 attempt to hold off a @entity23 air strike using anti-aircraft weapons			1

photos show women from @entity7 - controlled @entity67 and the village of @entity268 which sits on the @entity23 border
@entity23 and its @entity214 allies are currently conducting air strikes against @entity7 militiamen across @entity1
government troops are currently holed up in the port of @entity11 and are being besieged by the @entity16 - backed militia
among the cities to fall yesterday was @entity46 where women still enjoy an *unusual* amount of freedom
