' she adds : ' i have never seen @entity27 in a bathing suit at all			1
i mean , i 've seen @entity27 naked , so i guess it 's all relative			1
' full coverage : the first swimsuit @entity27 tries is quite modest , with a long tank top and shorts wrong style : @entity27 tells her friend @entity30 ( left ) that she plans to be ' gallivanting ' on the beach and thinks the swimsuit is too cumbersome honest friend : @entity30 observes that @entity27 is visibly sweating throughout the stressful shopping trip she suggests that perhaps @entity27 should try on the suit in a larger size , but @entity27 reveals that she finds the suit 's style cumbersome and wants to be able to move freely on the beach without having to adjust the fabric			1

' @entity30 notes that the stressful situation is having a noticeable effect on her friend , observing : ' @entity27 's trying on these bathing suits , and i 'm kind of hoping that whoever buys them next washes them , because she looks like she 's already been in the pool			2
two - piece : finally , @entity27 finds the perfect fit when she dons a black bikini , proclaiming that it ' just feels right ' well - suited : ' i do n't feel like i 'm trying to cover myself up , ' @entity27 says of the bikini ' but i guess if you have n't put on a bathing suit in 19 years , some work goes into it , ' @entity30 adds			1
