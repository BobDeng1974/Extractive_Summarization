by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the blue t - shirt , the slicked - back hair , the inane pointing at shellfish : it can only mean @entity8 's holiday			1
the prime minister 's return to @entity11 for a summer break was marked with the now - traditional photo opportunity , and his pr advisers are clearly taking no chances by doing anything radical or new			1
in fact readers might have struggled to tell the difference between this year 's pointedly relaxed shopping trip to a seafood market in @entity22 in @entity11 and last year 's relaxed pointing visit to a market in @entity25 , some 200 miles away			1
it is just the latest addition to the prime minister 's growing album of photographs in which he has been seen admiring the fish counters of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
it seems that image is based largely on joining his wife @entity54 in public admiration of prawns and mussels			2
not only was today 's image a repeat of last year 's , mr @entity8 has previously been seen buying shellfish in @entity61 , admiring the day 's catch in @entity34 and stopping off in @entity63 to get fish for tea in @entity66			2
the prime minister returned to @entity11 early this morning , after attending @entity69 commemorations in @entity70 last night			1
the @entity71 and their children @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 jetted off for their summer holiday on saturday			0
but the @entity67 left his family to fly to @entity78 the following day to attend the closing ceremony of the @entity80			0
he then travelled to @entity81 and @entity70 yesterday to take part in ceremonies to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity69			0
shortly after arriving in the resort 30 miles west of @entity87 , mr @entity8 was told his faith minister @entity88 had quit			1
video courtesy of @entity90 of @entity22 mr @entity8 flew back to @entity11 this morning after attending @entity69 commemorations in @entity70 last night the pm was all smiles , shaking hands with the locals , despite being told this morning that @entity94 minister @entity88 was quitting in protest at his policy on @entity97 mr @entity8 only spoke to @entity88 on the phone from @entity11 after she tweeted news of her resignation the senior @entity94 minister dramatically resigned in protest at the government 's ' morally indefensible ' policy on @entity97			2
@entity88 made the announcement on @entity107 , before the prime minister had even had chance to speak to her			1
but the drama was not going to stop the @entity71 rushing out to cast a critical eye over @entity22 's crustaceans			2
after a quick call to @entity115 , mr @entity8 pulled on a dark blue t - shirt , mrs @entity37 donned a dark dress and they set off to land themselves some lunch – and a photo opportunity			1
clutching sunglasses , the couple pointed purposefully at the produce , shook hands with the locals and joined the queue to pay for their purchases			1
it all seemed horribly familiar			0
last year mr @entity8 pulled on a blue shirt anbd mrs @entity37 wore a dark dress as they headed out to admire the fish market in @entity135 in the @entity48			1
maybe @entity137 media gurus know something the rest of us do n't			0
they obviously think voters like to see a prime minister who knows his way around a fish counter			1
in 2012 mr @entity8 made an impromptu stop at a @entity63 supermarket in @entity33 , where he bought fish and vegetables for a family dinner in 2011 mr @entity8 bought monkfish , scallops and mackerel from @entity153 in @entity61 , @entity32 during the 2010 election campaign mr @entity8 campaigned through the night , including a stop at @entity34 fish market in 2012 , mr @entity8 interrupted a visit to the @entity158 to stop off at @entity63 in @entity33 , where he bought sea bass from the fish counter , new potatoes , lemons and other fruit			1
a year earlier during a holiday to @entity32 – his fifth in 2011 – mr @entity8 bought monkfish , scallops and mackerel from @entity153 in @entity61			2
in the run - up to the general election in 2010 , mr @entity8 shunned the obvious politician 's photograph kissing babies to grapple with a large fish during a visit to @entity34			2
during the election campaign mr @entity8 boasted of having a ' good fishing heritage ' , telling the @entity177 how his grandfather was a ' brilliant fly fisherman '			0
the @entity137 leader added : ' i still do a bit of fishing , but not as much as i 'd like to			0
i went mackerel fishing with the children this summer and we ate everything we caught , i 'm pleased to say			0
i do a very good smoked mackerel paté			0
' @entity8 has been accused of wasting taxpayers ’ money after he used an @entity191 jet to fly back from his summer holiday after just one day abroad			0
the prime minister flew to @entity11 with his wife and three children on saturday where they are enjoying a 10 - day break staying in a villa			1
but after just a few hours in the sun , on sunday he was yesterday flown home by the @entity201 so he could attend the closing ceremony of the @entity80			0
he then used the @entity191 plane to fly to @entity81 and @entity70 for the @entity69 commemorations before flying back to @entity11 on a commercial flight at his own expense this morning			0
the prime minister has been criticised for not postponing his holiday for just a few days , which would have saved taxpayers thousands of pounds			1
mr @entity8 ’s extraordinary travel plan saw him rack up around 3,700 air miles in just three days			2
@entity214 mp @entity213 said : ‘ why could n’t he just have booked his holiday for after these events , rather than blowing thousands of pounds of taxpayers ’ money jetting backwards and forwards ? fellow colleague @entity219 added : ‘ it ’s not like he did n’t know these events were happening - we ’ve known the date of the @entity69 anniversary for 100 years			0
’ mr @entity8 , who has previously been accused of being too good at ‘ chillaxing ’ , had an @entity226 break with his family in @entity228			0
he and his wife will also take their traditional break to @entity32 later this summer with their children @entity73 , eight , @entity233 , six , and @entity75 , 23 months .			0

prime minister and his wife visit a market in @entity22 , 30 miles west of @entity87
clutching sunglasses , they pointed at the shellfish for the *cameras*
but with a blue t - shirt , dark dress and staged poses , it looked like 2013
last year they visited a fish market in @entity25 , some 200 miles away
