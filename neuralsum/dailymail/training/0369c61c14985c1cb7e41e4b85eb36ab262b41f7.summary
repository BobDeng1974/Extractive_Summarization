hate : @entity0 allegedly hates @entity1 and this animosity stems from accusations of racism against the former president during @entity1 's 2008 defeat of @entity7 the simmering cauldron of hatred that exists between the @entity10 and the @entity11 threatens to explode in a volcanic eruption that could threaten all @entity14 chances in 2016 , says a sensational new book			1
despite their much - vaunted public truce , journalist @entity16 claims in ' @entity19 ' that @entity0 despises president @entity1 and that @entity20 refers to @entity7 behind closed doors as the ' @entity22 '			1
the animosity between the @entity25 's two power couples has reached such intensity that @entity16 says the president is willing to renege on his promise to endorse @entity7 for 2016 and has teased the @entity11 with suggestions that @entity20 would be a strong candidate for the @entity30			1
dating back to then senator @entity1 's defeat of @entity7 for the 2008 @entity25 nomination they believed was theirs , @entity0 has never forgiven @entity1 for allegations he made during that bitter campaign			1
' i hate that man @entity1 more than any man i 've ever met , more than any man who ever lived , ' said @entity0 to a friend after @entity1 suggested he was a racist in 2008 according to @entity16 's book , excerpts of which appear in the @entity45			1
indeed , despite president @entity1 bringing @entity7 into his cabinet as secretary of state after his storming victory in 2008 , her presence only proved to antagonize relations between the two couples			1
they nicknamed @entity7 the ' @entity22 ' , in reference to the ugly and sturdy gnu that is often seen wandering the @entity78			2
in the run up to the 2012 election , president @entity1 's campaign team advised the sitting president that he needed to utilize the sure - touch of @entity0 if he wanted to secure a second term			1
controversial : @entity16 's new book lays bare the anger and hatred at the heart of the relationship between the @entity11 and the @entity10 loathe to do this , president @entity1 finally asked the former president to play a round of golf with him in september 2011 , to ask for his help			1
' i ’m not going to enjoy this , ' @entity0 told @entity7 according to @entity16			1
' i ’ve had two successors since i left the @entity98 — @entity99 and @entity1 — and i ’ve heard more from @entity99 , asking for my advice , than i ’ve heard from @entity1			2
i have no relationship with the president — none whatsoever , ' @entity0 said			2
' i really ca n’t stand the way @entity105 always seems to be hectoring when he talks to me			0
' sometimes we just stare at each other			0
it ’s pretty damn awkward			0
now we both have favors to ask each other , and it ’s going to be very unpleasant			0
but i ’ve got to get this guy to owe me and to be on our side			0
' the golf game was petty , tetchy and not without incident			0
president @entity0 immediately tried to claim the upper hand by reminding @entity1 that he presided over an economic golden age , while @entity1 was struggling to affect any change during the @entity119			1
hammering home his point , @entity0 told president @entity1 that obviously he and @entity7 would be running for president in 2016 and that his wife would be ' the most qualified , most experienced candidate , perhaps in history			1
' this rankled with president @entity1 , acutely aware of any attacks on his relative inexperience on walking into the @entity98			1
' and so @entity0 continued to talk about @entity7 ’s qualifications			2
and the coming campaign in 2016 , ' writes @entity16 as featured in the @entity45			0
deal : according to @entity16 , @entity0 agreed to fully campaign for @entity1 on the proviso he supported his wife in 2016 ' but @entity1 did n’t bite			1
he changed the subject several times			0
then suddenly , @entity1 said something that took @entity134 by complete surprise			0
he said , ‘ you know , @entity20 would make a great presidential candidate , too			0
’ ' @entity0 was speechless			0
was @entity1 comparing @entity20 ’s qualifications to @entity7 ’s ? ' @entity0 said that if he had n’t been on a mission to strike a deal with @entity1 , he might have stormed off the golf course then and there			1
' a deal was struck nonetheless			0
@entity0 delivered a barnstorming speech to the @entity145 , which threatened to upstage the president himself			2
however , the @entity11 both felt that the president was wavering in his commitment to endorse @entity7 for 2016 as his side of the bargain			1
in an effort to smooth over the rising tensions , the @entity10 hosted the @entity11 on march 1 , 2013 at a dinner - the day that the $ 85billion ' sequester ' budget cuts went into effect			0
the meal could go down as the moment that all bets were off in the two couple 's political marriage of necessity			0
according to @entity16 , who spoke to those with knowledge of the dinner , @entity0 could n't help hectoring the president about his handling of the economy			2
@entity7 , attempting to change the subject asked @entity20 if it was true she might copy her and run as a senator , in @entity172 , after her husband left office			2
@entity20 demurred to answer and allegedly @entity0 was stunned that @entity7 would have shown her hand so openly			1
the back - and - forth between the four grew steadily more icy			0
@entity178 : the two @entity25 endure an icy relationship which is not helped by their enduring animosity towards each other @entity0 suggested that the president turn over his much - vaunted social media enabled campaign know - how to the @entity25 party at large			1
' you have to use your organization to aid the candidate in 2016 , ' @entity0 pressed @entity1			1
' really ? ' replied a sarcastic @entity1 , according to @entity16			0
things deteriorated as president @entity0 continued to lecture the table as the president began to ignore his guests and check his @entity193			2
according to @entity16 , @entity7 tried to change the subject again and asked if @entity1 was happy he would n't have to campaign again , especially because he did n't seem to like it			2
' for a guy who does n’t like it , ' @entity1 replied , ' i ’ve done pretty well			0
' marriage of necessity : the @entity11 fear that the @entity10 will renege on their promise to support @entity7 in 2016 ' well , ' @entity0 said according to @entity16 in the @entity45 , ' i was glad to pitch in and help get you re-elected			1
' the after - effects of that meal are still being felt			0
the @entity11 have become convinced that @entity1 will not back @entity7 for 2016 and that he is seeking to endorse vice-president @entity205 or a new , young politician , just like he was			1
' he ’s convinced himself he ’s been a brilliant president , and wants to clone himself — to find his mini-me , ' says @entity0 to @entity208 according to @entity16			2
' he ’s hunting for someone to succeed him , and he believes the @entity211 people do n’t want to vote for someone who ’s been around for a long time			0
he thinks that your mother and i are what he calls " so 20th century "			0
he ’s looking for ­ another @entity1			0
