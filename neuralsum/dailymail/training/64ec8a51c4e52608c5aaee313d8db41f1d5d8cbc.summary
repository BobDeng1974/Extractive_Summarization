by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 07:48 est , 21 june 2012 a luxury six - bedroom country home is up for sale at just £ 75,000 with a hidden catch - it could be flattened by rocks at any time			1
the spacious family home sits on the banks of one of @entity9 's best salmon rivers with panoramic views across miles of rolling countryside in the @entity12			1
it would normally be on sale for around £ 500,000 but the estate agent handling the sale has admitted : ' there 's just one snag			1
' luxury property : the unfinished three - storey six - bedroom home is expected to sell for just £ 75,000 - but it could be hit by falling rocks at any time rock danger : already three boulders have crashed into the back of the home in the last 12 months the house , named @entity26 , could be hit by falling boulders from a former tinworks at any time - causing serious damage to the property			1
already three two tonne boulders have crashed into the home in the past year causing some minor damage to the walls			1
the tinworks was closed in the 18th century and a modern housing development was built on it around 15 years ago			0
but the property , in the village of @entity38 , @entity39 , is superbly placed on the banks of the @entity41 close to the @entity43 border			1
it attracts fishermen from all over @entity46 for its wild salmon			2
it boasts four reception rooms , two kitchens and two bathrooms but has not yet been fully fitted out			0
the @entity52 and the @entity53 run through the village which has a post office and two pubs			0
spice girl @entity57 lives in a neighbouring village and @entity60 author @entity59 was brought up nearby			0
spectacular : the home is enviably located in the @entity12 and could sell for £ 500,000 if there was no risk of falling rocks danger : a huge boulder which has come down the hillside property is seen no more than a few feet from the unfinished property which was built more than five years ago famous resident : spice girl @entity57 lives nearby in a neighbouring village @entity73 , managing director of his own auctioneer firm , said if a buyer is able to pin the rocks back they could potentially have a bargain property			1
however , at present the home can not get building insurance - and no banks would be willing to provide a mortgage for it			1
it is due to go under the hammer at auction tonight , and the buyer may decide to knock the property down and start again			2
mr @entity73 said : ' three boulders have hit the house in the last 12 months and have caused superficial damage			2
if someone was standing there at the time they could have been killed			0
' it is being marketed as a potential building plot - it is a house that needs to be demolished			0
people have said they can get round the problem through engineering with pinning and netting			2
' they have suggested putting big long girders into the rock face ever metre or so and then installing chicken mesh to secure the whole property			1
' the house is built very close to the rock face which makes this difficult to do			0
' people are looking at this and thinking they could spend £ 50,000 fixing the problem and then sell the property on for £ 400,000 or £ 500,000			1
' two giant rocks which have rolled down the bank could be seen less than 10ft from the back of the house today			0
rock risk : a buyer could install wire netting behind the property to stop the property being damaged			1
however , it was built so close to the cliff face such a task would be very difficult when the land was sold to the builder , there was a covenant stipulating exactly what sort of house could be built to avoid the property being hit by boulders			2
however , the owners ignored the covenant and went ahead with their own flawed project			0
the interior of the three - storey property is unfinished because the developers stopped work when they discovered the problem more than five years ago			2
the advertisement says : ' it requires completion works both internally and externally but has double glazing and gas fired central heating			0
' a retired businessman who lives in the village said : ' it 's a lovely modern house and it 's going for a song			0
' but would you sleep at night knowing a huge lump of rock could land in your bed at any time			0

property in the @entity12 , sitting on the banks of one of @entity9 's best salmon rivers , would otherwise sell for £ 500,000
three two tonne boulders have crashed into the home in the last year
buyers will be unable to get a mortgage or insurance for the home
but they could use steel girders and netting to *protect* the property from further *rockfalls*
