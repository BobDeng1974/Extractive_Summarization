it is meant to be a delightfully sweet and tasty treat , but the @entity2 , a doughnut - muffin hybrid , has left a very bitter taste in one pastry chef 's mouth , after @entity7 trademarked the name			1
@entity9 , owner of @entity10 's of @entity11 , has been selling her duffins from her four @entity14 bakeries for over two years			1
she was shocked to learn that high street coffee giants @entity7 had launched it 's own version of the snack and registered the name			1
caked off : the owner of @entity14 's @entity10 's bakery is furious after @entity7 's trademarked the name ' @entity2 ' the @entity22 's of @entity2 uses a buttermilk and nutmeg batter which is baked and stuffed with raspberry jam before being dipped in melted butter and then dusted with sugar			1
the @entity7 version , which was developed by their pastry suppliers @entity30 also uses nutmeg and buttermilk and is injected with raspberry jam , however it foregoes the butter dip process			1
she told @entity37 news : ' i did n't really give it too much thought until i found out their version of the duffin also contains raspberry jam , nutmeg and buttermilk			0
' my recipe , which was published in my cookbook back in august 2011 , is the only one out there to carry all of those traits			0
doughnut muffins have been around for a while , @entity50 even has them in her first cookbook -- but the style of mine , that is what makes it unique			0
' what makes a @entity2 characteristic is that it 's dipped in melted butter and then rolled in sugar			2
the @entity7 version does n't even bother with the dipping in melted butter			1
by all accounts it is n't even a true doughnut - muffin -- it 's a jam - filled muffin			0
' ms @entity9 has described theirs as being an inferior version of her recipe			2
in a statement @entity7 ' vice-president for marketing and category @entity69 , said : ' since launching , we have discovered there are other @entity12 out there in the @entity75 , including at @entity76 's of @entity11 â€¦ however we 'd like to make it clear that neither @entity7 nor @entity30 has suggested to @entity10 's of @entity11 that they will attempt to stop them selling their own @entity12			1
' the @entity78 ( left ) uses a very similar recipe to the @entity10 ( right ) however @entity7 said they had no idea that other duffins were being sold or that anyone was using the name			1
they claimed to have conducted an ' extensive ' online search as well as a full trademark search for the name but had drawn a blank			0
' inspired by our muffins , we sat together with our bakers and pondered how you could make a muffin go one step further , ' their marketing department claimed			0
however ms @entity9 remains entirely unconvinced , pointing out that a quick google search will reveal dozens of refernces and recipes for @entity12 , including her own			0
she told the @entity98 : ' @entity7 maintains its original account that its invention is a unique invention and that it did an extensive online search for the word duffin and found nothing and as a result their supplier trademarked that name			2
i think that 's rubbish			0
' i would love to see the emails between @entity7 and @entity30 during the birth of their invention			2

@entity10 's of @entity11 has been selling duffins for over two years
@entity7 own version launched last week uses a very similar recipe
@entity30 , which developed @entity7 ' @entity2 , trademarks the name
