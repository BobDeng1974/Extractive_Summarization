by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:04 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 13:55 est , 3 june 2013 seeking offers over £ 295,000 for a remote two - bedroom house was certain to raise eyebrows in today ’s sluggish property market			2
the sellers might have expected to sell their ‘ pleasant but unremarkable ’ @entity8 hideaway for a few thousand pounds over the odds			2
but then @entity10 has a value - added element – the most dramatic panoramic views in the whole of @entity14			1
room with a view : the bungalow , 20 miles south of @entity18 , overlooks @entity19 and charmed one buyer into shelling out £ 530,000 stunning : the single storey house in the north west highlands ' view was what drew buyers to the property and that has persuaded one extremely ‘ determined ’ house hunter to offer 80 per cent over the asking price			1
the sale price of just over £ 530,000 for a modern , single - storey property valued at £ 300,000 is unlikely to provoke a housing boom in the north - west			1

the house is not large – it has two reception rooms , a conservatory and two bedrooms which are en suite			2
flurry of offers : the house was put on the market by @entity56 , who recorded an ' immediate surge of interest ' must - have property : the highest bid was from a buyer who was ' simply determined ' not to be outbid , the estate agent said , and missives were concluded at the weekend stunning : the house sits in 100 acres on an elevated situation over @entity19 ( pictured ) , with breathtaking views over sea and mountain from every window the nearest village is @entity73 , two miles away , which has a shop , a petrol station , a gp ’s surgery and a primary school			1
