@entity0 recently highlighted the importance of developing new services and mobile phone apps to help young people with depression and mental health problems minister for care @entity0 recently revealed that he is working towards developing more apps to help young people suffering with mental health problems and depression			1
he said in an interview with the times : ' we ’ve got a taskforce looking at how we can modernise children and young people ’s mental health and that ’s one of the key elements to it			1
” ' if you ’re a teenager and your world revolves around digital access , we must make sure you get access to therapy online			2
so these programmes are being developed			0
' but one such app already exists ; @entity28 is a digital tool which supports therapy services			1
it allows users to text daily updates of how their feeling			0
the can then use the analysis tool to reassess how they are feeling and can set the app to send goal reminders via text message			0
lastly the app allows users to set reminders for appointments and agendas so that they can take control over elements of their life			0
the app was created by @entity47 a company which is passionate about using design and technology to tackle social problems and they work closely with many @entity53 healthcare providers			0
@entity54 spoke to @entity55 who explained that for the @entity47 team it was important to create something that would really help people			1
she said : ' @entity61 has a few aims , first and foremost we want to help people			2
we ’re a social enterprise so for us it ’s about social impact , making a real , qualitative difference to people ’s lives			2
' there are now more mobile phones than people in the @entity74 and we want people using @entity53 services to benefit from really cheap , accessible technology like @entity79 messaging			1
' @entity55 told us she even uses the app herself : ' i ’m a service user myself and i think apps and other technologies have a huge role to play in improving mental health and wellbeing			2
' personally i ’m using @entity61 in my own treatment and over the last five months it ’s really helped me to stay on track with my recovery			0
' it ’s amazing that something as simple as a couple of texts messages can make such a big difference			0
' the @entity28 allows users to log their feelings users of the @entity28 can send text messages describing their feelings , this helps them to assess how they are doing during the day but she agrees that the app should be used in conjunction with other therapies			2
' we do n’t want to replace clinicians , we know that they have a huge impact on people ’s lives			2
' research shows that it ’s actually not the type of therapy you have but the relationship with your clinician that has the biggest effect on treatment efficacy			0
what we want to do is support clinicians to make their work even better			0
' in his interview @entity123 revealed that there are more apps being developed but that it is important to remember when testing them that every young sufferer is different			1
' what i want to achieve is a much more seamless service that allows you access online , face to face or over the telephone , whichever is appropriate			0
' ' these platforms are evidence - based so the risk is very low that they ’re not appropriate			0
some people may need more than that so you have to have access to a gradation of different type of service , ' he said			2
when using the @entity148 you can log feelings about anything from how you 're feeling that day to things you 've got planned @entity61 will text you to remind you of appointments and meetings on your agenda @entity54 spoke to @entity155 , director of media and campaigns at the charity @entity158 which is committed to improving the mental health of children and young people			1
@entity155 agreed with @entity0 and @entity55 that apps can be a positive way to help some young people with their issues			1
she said : ' what we need is a plethora of services both online and off			2
but i do think online and app support can be very positive for young people especially we find that they do interact a lot online , it 's where they feel comfortable			1
' sometimes young people can be scared and or feel intimidated about phoning their doctor whereas online there are able to engage more freely			1
' what there does need to be though is some regularity and i would say that the online support , whilst very useful , should never take the place of face to face therapies			0
' apps should always lead on to phone or face to face support , working as a sign post for young people and enabling them to get the help they need			1
' if the @entity53 plan to work on apps the most important thing is that they speak to the young people , to those who have the first hand experience , so that they can work out what sort of services they 're looking for			1
' according research by @entity158 one in 10 children and young people aged five to 16 suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder			1
the number of those aged 15 to 16 with depression doubled between the 1980 's and the 2000 's with nearly 80,000 children and young people suffering from severe depression			1
if you do feel suicidal and need to speak to someone , call the @entity211 on 08457 90 90 90 or go to samaritans.org alternatively , talk to your @entity213 - if you do n't get the help you want , go to another doctor			0
visit mental health websites mind , @entity216 and the @entity217			0
@entity218 can be a difficult and debilitating but @entity219 aims to show that you do n't have to go it alone			0
