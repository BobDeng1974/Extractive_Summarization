by @entity0 published : 01:28 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 03:04 est , 16 november 2012 oil giant @entity1 is to pay the biggest fine in @entity4 history after agreeing a $ 4.5billion settlement with authorities for claims relating to the @entity9 disaster			1
@entity1 will pay the fine over six years after reaching a deal with the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) and the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) that has seen it plead guilty to 14 criminal charges relating to the oil rig accident in 2010 , which killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the @entity19			1
@entity21 , chief executive of @entity1 , said : ' we apologise for our role in the accident and as today 's resolution with the @entity4 government further reflects , we have accepted responsibility for our actions			2
the record - breaking fine surpasses even the $ 1.3billion ( £ 820 million ) fine paid by drugs group @entity45 in 2009 for marketing fraud related to a pain medicine			1
@entity1 will pay $ 4billion dollars ( £ 2.5billion ) to the @entity12 in installments over five years			2
it will pay an additional $ 525million ( £ 331million ) to the @entity13 over a period of three years			0
@entity1 will make the first payment of $ 175million ( £ 110million ) this year to the @entity13 the group has already paid out more than $ 38billion ( £ 24billion ) relating to the oil spill			1
@entity1 is hoping to wrap up its financial liabilities from the @entity9 disaster , but the overall impact on the @entity56 is still not known by researchers			2
oil spewed into the @entity19 from the @entity59 for 87 days before it was finally capped			1
some 68,000 square miles of the gulf were at one time covered in oil slick , about the area of @entity64			0
more than 6,000 seabirds , 600 turtles and 500 dolphins were found dead as a result of the spill			0
many dolphins are still being found sick from apparent oil contamination and zooplankton have recently found to show traces of oil , as well			0
the full impact of the oil spill will not be estimated until the government releases its @entity78 , which will collect data from dozens of ongoing studies of the gulf			0
mr @entity21 said : ' all of us at @entity1 deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the @entity9 accident as well as the impact of the spill on the @entity56 region			2
' he added : ' since the spill , we have worked hard to rebuild confidence in the company			0
' we take seriously not only our commitment to safety and operational excellence but also our communications with stakeholders , including the public , the government and our investors			0
' today 's settlement removes some of the uncertainty hanging over the stock since the disaster , but it does not cover outstanding civil claims against the group			0
@entity1 said it will ' continue to vigorously defend itself ' against civil claims and allegations of gross negligence			2
' we are open to settlements , but only on reasonable terms , ' said mr @entity21			0
the deal could resolve a significant share of the liability that @entity1 faces after an explosion killed 11 workers and fouled the shorelines of four @entity56 states in the worst offshore spill in @entity4 history			1
@entity1 still faces economic and environmental damage claims sought by @entity4 @entity56 states and other private plaintiffs			2
it is unclear what form of criminal misconduct @entity1 will plead guilty to			1
in an august filing , the @entity12 said ' reckless management ' of the @entity59 ' constituted gross negligence and willful misconduct , ' which it intended to prove at a pending civil trial set to begin in @entity133 in february 2013			0
the @entity4 government has not yet filed any criminal charges in the case			1
it is unclear whether the deal will resolve any civil charges brought by the @entity12			0
it is also unclear how large a financial penalty @entity1 might pay to resolve the charges , or other punishments that @entity1 might face			1
negligence is a central issue to @entity1 's potential liability			2
a gross negligence finding could nearly quadruple the civil damages owed by @entity1 under the @entity42 to $ 21billion in a straight - line calculation			1
according to the @entity12 , errors made by @entity1 and @entity152 - based @entity151 , owner of the @entity9 platform , in deciphering a key pressure test of the @entity59 are a clear indication of gross negligence			1
sickly : thousands of birds , reptiles and dolphins died in the oil slick and many are still showing signs of contamination ' that such a simple , yet fundamental and safety - critical test could have been so stunningly , blindingly botched in so many ways , by so many people , demonstrates gross negligence , ' the government said in its august filing			2
the mile - deep @entity59 well spewed 4.9million barrels of oil into the @entity19 over a period of 87 days			1
the torrent fouled shorelines from @entity177 to @entity178 and eclipsed in severity the 1989 @entity180 in @entity181			0
after several failed attempts , @entity1 finally capped the well on july 15 , 2010 , halting the flow of oil after more than 85 days and putting a stop to what became one of the most closely watched shows on tv and the @entity190 : the live spill - camera image of the gushing well			1
@entity193 ’s grandson @entity192 of @entity194 , @entity177 , was killed in the blast			0
she said somebody needs to be held accountable			0
' it just bothers me so bad when i see the commercials on tv and they brag about how the @entity19 is back , but they never say anything about the 11 lives that were lost			1
they want us to forget about it , but they do n’t know what they ’ve done to the families that lost someone , ' she said			0
the spill exposed lax government oversight and led to a temporary ban on deepwater drilling while officials and the oil industry studied the risks , worked to make it safer and developed better disaster plans			0
@entity1 ’s environmentally - friendly image was tarnished , and @entity1 ceo @entity222 stepped down after the company ’s repeated gaffes , including his statement at the height of the crisis : ' i ’d like my life back			1
' @entity1 has already announced an uncapped class - action settlement with private plaintiffs that the company estimates will cost $ 7.8billion to resolve litigation brought by over 100,000 individuals and businesses claiming economic and medical damages from the spill .			1

@entity1 pleaded guilty to 14 criminal charges relating to *incident* that killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the @entity19
record - breaking fine surpasses that paid by drugs group @entity45 in 2009
