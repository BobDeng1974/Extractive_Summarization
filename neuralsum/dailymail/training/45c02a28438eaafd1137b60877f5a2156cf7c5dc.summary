a plague of wasps has struck @entity7 - and they 're heading for a hamper near you			1
experts today warned that the late spring and long winter have allowed the stinging insects a long and undisturbed hibernation			1
billions of the airborne menaces are emerging from their nests and taking to the skies for their annual feeding frenzy around three weeks later than in previous years			1
a bumper crop of fruit this year is likely to keep the creatures going until they either die or go into hibernation after the @entity40			0
and with plenty of insects to feed on and a dry end to the summer - not to mention all those sugary drinks lying around by people making the most of a sunny end to the summer holidays - the wasps are more than making up for their late arrival			1
victim : @entity53 with her seven - year - old @entity54 , who were both attacked by a swarm of wasps a swarm nearly claimed the life of one cocker spaniel in @entity60 near @entity61			2
the seven - year - old dog , named @entity63 , went into anaphylactic shock when she was stung more than 130 times			2
owner @entity53 , 35 , who is a vet with the @entity68 animal charity in @entity69 , said : ' it was terrifying			1
they really went for @entity63			0
there were so many that she was completely covered			0
' we tried to outrun them , but they got hold of @entity63			0
there were so many wasps in her coat			2
danger zones : the @entity84 site shows @entity85 as the area of the @entity7 worst hit by wasps this year ' we tried to fight them off but they stung us too			1
it was particularly bad for @entity63 and she collapsed at the side of the path			0
' @entity54 survived after being rushed to the vet , where she was treated with strong steroids and spent the night under observation			0
when the vets later posted details of the incident on their @entity103 page , several people replied , saying they had also been attacked by wasps			0
the hotspot for wasps appears to be in @entity85 , according to pest controller @entity107 , which has set up an interactive website to allow users to log wasp sightings and rate them by severity			2
swarm : the insects are amassing in greater numbers and later than in previous years the capital is followed by @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and the @entity120 , according to the @entity84 site			0
@entity122 , chairman of the @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , said : ' only four weeks ago i was being asked where all the wasps had gone			2
' firstly , we had a really cold winter which meant that hibernation was more successful than usual			2
' the worst thing the wasp queen can have is a warm winter because they fidget and use up the food reserves			1
i suspect this has had an effect on mortality			0
sticking around : the wasps are likely to remain on the scene until the end of the @entity40 , when they die or go into hibernation ' and of course , we have had some quite reasonable weather this year			0
' this year i would say the wasps - like everything else in the insect world - are about three weeks late because of the lateness of @entity152			1
' the @entity153 , i suspect , has meant they have just stayed in hibernation for longer , and have been delayed by the cold weather			0
' and simply , a warmer drier summer is good for wasps because for a start if you have got a really dreary winter , the queen ca nâ€™t get hold of the food and you get massive mortality .			1

wasp population *increased* on last few years
swarms hit @entity7 three weeks later than usual
long winter allowed wasps to hibernate , while late summer provided abundant food
@entity176 almost died in @entity69 after suffering more than 130 wasp stings
