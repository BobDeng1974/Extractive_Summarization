what could be so horrible ? grade - school math. as schools around the @entity6 implement national @entity8 learning standards , parents trying to help their kids with math homework say that adding , subtracting , multiplying and dividing has become as complicated as calculus			1
@entity11 ( right ) works on math homework with her 6 - year - old daughter @entity13 at their home in @entity15 , @entity16			1
as schools around the @entity6 implement national @entity8 learning standards , parents like @entity11 trying to help their kids with math homework say that adding , subtracting , multiplying and dividing has become as complicated as calculus they 're stumped by unfamiliar terms like ' rectangular array ' and ' area model			1
' they wrestle with division that requires the use of squares , slashes and dots			1
they rage over impenetrable word problems			2
adopted by 44 states , the @entity8 is a set of @entity35 and math standards that spell out what students should know and when			1
the standards for elementary math emphasize that kids should not only be able to solve arithmetic problems using the tried - and - true methods their parents learned , but understand how numbers relate to each other			1
@entity46 , 41 , of @entity15 , @entity16 , said her daughter 's homework requires her to know four different ways to add			1
' that is way too much to ask of a first grader , ' she said			2
' she ca n't remember them all , and i do n't know them all , so we just do the best that we can			2
' simple arithmetic is n't so simple anymore , leading to plenty of angst at home			2
even celebrities are n't immune : the comedian @entity62 took to @entity63 recently to vent about his kids ' convoluted homework , writing that his daughters went from loving math to crying about it			1
comedian @entity62 has even taken to @entity63 to make fun of how ridiculous he thinks the @entity8 math standards are			1
he has two daughters , @entity72 and @entity73 , who attend elementary school in @entity75 ' part of what we are trying to teach children is to become problem solvers and thinkers , ' said @entity82 , president of the @entity83			2
' we want students to understand what they 're doing , not just get the right answer			1
' that 's a radically different approach than many parents are accustomed to			1
@entity89 , 40 , of @entity90 , @entity91 , was puzzled by her fourth - grade daughter 's long division homework , a foreign amalgam of boxes , slashes and dots with nary a quotient or dividend in sight			1
' if we are sitting there for 20 minutes trying to do a simple problem , how is an 8 , 9 , 10 - year - old supposed to figure it out ? ' she said			2
' it 's incredibly frustrating for the student and the parent			2
' a sample question from @entity75 's @entity8 math exam for the third grade another sample question from @entity75 's @entity8 exam for the third grade whether @entity8 itself is responsible for the homework headaches is a contentious issue			1
some experts say @entity8 promotes reform math , a teaching method that gained currency in the 1990s			1
derided as ' fuzzy ' math by critics , reform math says kids should explore and understand concepts like place value before they become fluent in the standard way of doing arithmetic			1
critics say it fails to stress basic computational skills , leaving students unprepared for higher math. this question , for @entity75 's @entity8 math test for fourth graders , is one of the most detailed questions asked on the exam @entity140 mathematician @entity139 calls the reform math - inspired standards a ' complete mess ' — too advanced for younger students , not nearly rigorous enough in the upper grades			1
and teachers , he contends , are largely ill - prepared to put the standards into practice			1
' you are asking teachers to teach something that is incredibly complicated to kids who are n't ready for it , ' said @entity139 , who voted against the standards as part of the committee that reviewed them			1
' if you do n't think craziness will result , then you 're being fundamentally naive			2
' under @entity8 , parents are likely to see some unfamiliar terms on their children 's elementary - school math homework			1
here are some examples drawn from @entity165 's math curriculum : @entity166 addition : solve using your place value chart and number disks , composing a 10 when necessary : 53 + 19 subtraction : @entity172 checked out 28 books at the library			1
he read and returned some books			2
he still has 19 books checked out			2
how many books did @entity172 return ? draw a tape diagram or number bond to solve			2

36 × 4 = ? @entity188 36 + 4 = ? @entity214 ? ÷ 4 = 36 @entity215 multiplication : represent the following expressions with disks , regrouping as necessary , writing a matching expression , and recording the partial products vertically : 3 x @entity222 problem : @entity223 says she found a shortcut for doing multiplication problems			0
when she multiplies 3 × 24 , she says , ' 3 × 4 is 12 ones , or 1 ten and 2 ones			0
then there 's just 2 tens left in 24 , so add it up and you get 3 tens and 2 ones			0
