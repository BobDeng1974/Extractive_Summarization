train delays mean @entity1 often has to go to bed without a cuddle from her daddy			1
but rather than complain to him , the six - year - old went to the source of the problem instead – and wrote a letter to rail bosses			1
and now @entity1 's moving letter , addressed to ' dear mr @entity11 ' , has been backed by thousands of people after her father @entity13 posted a picture of it online			1
she wrote to @entity17 bosses : ' my daddy is always late home and i miss him very much			1
please get him home on time			0
@entity22 says you take all his money that is why i ca n't go to @entity25			2
i really want to go to @entity25			2
@entity39 's services have been in a state of chaos for two weeks since a new timetable came in which has led to trains being regularly delayed , suspended or cancelled			0
and according to official @entity50 figures , none of @entity39 's 7.29am trains between @entity47 and @entity48 reached the capital at the scheduled time of 8.35am last year			0
@entity1 's note , written in black biro and carefully checked for spelling mistakes , even caused many social media users to contact @entity17 directly , demanding @entity1 be treated to a holiday in @entity58			1
one @entity60 user , @entity59 , wrote to the rail company and mr @entity62 : ' hope your daughter gets more daddy time and @entity66			1
' mr @entity62 also tweeted the company to say : ' i think @ @entity69 should compensate my daughter for her time without her dad			2
' @entity62 's six - year - old daughter , @entity1 , has written to rail bosses to ask them to stop delaying her father 's train @entity62 spends just over £ 4.000 a year commuting to from his home in @entity34 , @entity35 , to @entity36 the 35 - year - old , who also has a baby son , @entity31 , with wife @entity28 , 41 , spends £ 4,000 a year travelling to work as a graphic designer at entertainment firm @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83			1
mr @entity62 , who also runs his own card - making business , said : ' at six years old @entity1 is already a strong - headed young girl ! ' i love spending time with her and she gets upset when i miss her bedtime			1
' unfortunately this has happened a lot as of late because of @entity17 and their long delays			0
i hope they get back to @entity1 with a response and sort out the trains so i can spend some time with my family			0
' last night , one of the peak - time trains between @entity83 and @entity34 had six coaches instead of eight , causing one commuter to post a picture online of a packed carriage and write : ' six carriages on peak @entity34 line service			1
think some got left behind at platform			0
' yesterday , @entity17 apologised to @entity1 – but failed to mention anything about her @entity66 hopes			2
a spokesman added : ' trains to @entity48 and @entity36 travel over the most congested part of the whole of @entity112 's railway network and we are constantly pushing against the boundaries of what is physically possible on the infrastructure to provide as much capacity as possible to and from @entity83			2
' @entity39 has apologised to mr @entity62 's daughter , @entity1 , for repeatedly delaying her father 's train commuters are set to experience disruption and overcrowding at @entity36 for the next 18 months whilst it undergoes major rebuilding work			1
the 178 - year - old station is the oldest surviving rail terminal			0
it is due to be rebuilt as part of the £ 6.5billion @entity130 programme and is expected to take three years			0
the building work has seen the closure of platforms one to six at the station			0
as a result services run by the @entity137 train company to and from @entity139 station will not call at @entity36 main line station until august 2016			2
a new timetable was also introduced at the station for @entity39 and @entity130 services , which has led to major disruption			0
once the work is completed the station will be able to up capacity by 65 per cent , @entity50 said .			0
