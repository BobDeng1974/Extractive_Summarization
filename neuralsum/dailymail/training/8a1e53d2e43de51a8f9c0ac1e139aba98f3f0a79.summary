by @entity0 and @entity1 promise : the prime minister has vowed to find a long - term reform for the notoriously complex charging system @entity8 's most hated business tax , which costs firms around £ 24billion a year , will be fundamentally reformed , the prime minister claimed yesterday			1
@entity10 said he totally understands the anger and resentment created by business rates , the corporate equivalent of council tax			1
speaking at the @entity17 conference in @entity18 yesterday , he said : ‘ i think we do need to look at longer term reform			1
‘ it is not going to be easy because rates raise whatever it is about £ 24billion and i do n’t think there is any one solution that is going to make everybody happy			2
‘ but i think we ’ve got to start addressing this issue , particularly this issue about internet retailing and high - street retailing			2
’ mr @entity10 said he agreed with @entity31 , the federation ’s national policy chairman , who had asked what the @entity34 leader plans to do about business rates during yesterday ’s conference			2
mr @entity31 said : ‘ day in , day out , our members are still telling us that this is the biggest problem that they face going forwards			0
will you finally tackle this by looking at how you could ensure a complete reform occurs ? ’ speaking after the conference , mr @entity31 , a woodworking engineer by trade , slammed business rates as ‘ a tax which is not fit for purpose in the 21st - century ’			1
the business rate charging system , which is notoriously complicated , involves the @entity49 setting the ‘ per square metre ’ charge for a premises , such as a shop			1
this rate is then submitted to the local council which decides how much will be charged in business rates , subject to various reliefs and discounts			0
efforts : december 's @entity59 gave small business owners a £ 2.5bn tax break on business rates , which came into effect yesterday , to stop empty shops blighting high streets it has led to extraordinary situations in which a retailer in @entity68 has a higher ‘ per square metre ’ charge than @entity70 , @entity18 ’s exclusive department store			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ lots of our members are saying this is a fundamental issue			0
it is affecting far too many businesses			0
' it is a tax paid before you even open the gates or the door			2
it is a tax which is not fit for purpose in the 21st - century			1
’ @entity82 claimed mr @entity10 is wrong to say his hands are tied by @entity84 to make policy changes in december ’s @entity59 , small business owners were yesterday given a £ 2.5billion tax break on business rates in a desperate bid to stop empty shops blighting ailing high - streets			1
changes include a discount of up to £ 1,000 a year for small retail businesses on their business rate bills as well as capping the increase in april at two per cent			0
small business rate relief , which was due to end in the spring , was also extended for a further 12 months until april 2015 , benefitting a total of 540,000 small firms			0
it is not clear how business rates could be reformed , or when any changes will come into effect , but it is unlikely before the next general election			0
mr @entity10 made his pledge as @entity82 yesterday put himself even further at odds with his more @entity109 colleagues by saying it is ‘ mythology ’ the @entity8 is powerless to oppose @entity84 regulations			0
the cabinet minister said it was not true that ‘ heroic @entity8 ministers ’ are resisting a slew of @entity116 directives that tie up business in red tape			2
he said : ‘ it ’s very hard to find an @entity116 regulation of significance which has been forced on an unwilling @entity8 minister who voted against it			1
’ mr @entity82 added that such an idea ‘ had always been a myth			0
’ mr @entity82 ’s comments contradict those of his leader @entity10 last week , when he accused @entity130 of ‘ burdensome , unjustified and premature regulatory burdens			0
’ a @entity133 spokesman said ‘ a longer term review of business rates administration will consider the system ’s transparency , efficiency and responsiveness			1
