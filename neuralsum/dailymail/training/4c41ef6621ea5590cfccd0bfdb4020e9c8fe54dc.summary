' growing up i was really girly , i would buy dresses and skirts			0
i knew i was gay and i thought i had to change to fit in , ' she explains on @entity16 show bodyshockers			2
' i felt like a lost girl in a gay bar with long hair , heels and a dress			0
everyone else had short hair , piercings and tattoos			0
' @entity4 shows off the skull and wings tattoo she regrets having done in her twenties the 31 - year - old admits the tattoo looks like something a biker mad @entity30 fan would have the financial adviser chose the ' manly ' skull surrounded by wings in her bid to look more butch			1
but ten years later , she says the gay community has moved on and she no longer feels she has to conform to a stereotypical image			1
she said : ' when i came out i tried to fit in to the gay community by getting my hair cut short and getting piercings and tattoos			1
' now i 'm more girly again , it does n't suit me			0
i 'm back to being comfortable in myself			0
the tattoo is embarrassing , it 's massive			0
every time i see it gets me down			0
as soon as it 's gone i 'll feel like me again			0
' @entity4 thought she had to have tattoos and piercings to fit in when she first came out as gay the financial adviser with @entity59 presenter @entity58 who hears about her tattoo regrets @entity4 said the laser removal surgery was agony and ' worse than getting a tattoo ' her girlfriend agrees that the tattoo does n't suit her , comparing it to something a biker mad @entity69 fan might have			1
@entity4 said : ' i ca n't stand it , i hate it , i wish i never got it			2
' she was given the chance to turn back the clock by having laser removal surgery as the @entity59 cameras rolled			2
