@entity1 coach @entity0 is considering making changes to his line - up for wednesday 's @entity5 game against @entity6 after analysing the 5 - 1 humiliation at the hands of @entity9			1
the defending champions head to the @entity11 in @entity12 needing not only a win but also a vastly - improved performance after being torn apart by the @entity15			2
@entity0 has now taken the time to study that defeat and admits he may switch some players around , although he refused to play the blame game			1
' however , we do n't want to rush into things			0
' if i made a change , it would n't be to point the finger at someone			0
' this is a short tournament and we would look to find the best solution			0
' @entity0 is reluctant , however , to replace goalkeeper @entity36 despite his woeful display against the @entity15 , which the national team captain described as the worst game of his career			1
' as always @entity36 has given proof of his captaincy and his commitment to the national team , ' @entity0 said			1
' i remember when i came back to the changing room after the press conference , he was talking to his team - mates , acting as a captain			2
' @entity1 have faced criticism for bringing some players that were in the @entity5 - winning side of 2010 , with many not having been in top form in the 2013 - 14 campaign			1
three @entity57 players in particular have been called into question : @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
flying @entity15 : @entity62 scored @entity9 's opening goal in their 5 - 1 destruction of @entity1 however , @entity0 insists that everyone who has travelled to @entity67 deserved to do so			1
' we have brought 16 of our 23 players that are world champions , ' he said			0
' they have taken part in qualifying and have reached the semi-finals of the @entity75 and done well in @entity76			0
' we have brought them because we are convinced that they are the best , even if others may have a different opinion			0
' we do have seven new players			0
' all of the coaches that have so far tasted defeat in their @entity5 openers have stressed the need to look forward and not to dwell on the result			1
worried much ? @entity36 has been heavily criticised for his performance against the @entity15 yet the way @entity1 collapsed against the @entity15 will not be forgotten any time soon by anyone connected to the squad			1
we knew @entity9 were going to be a permanent danger and we were n't able to stop them , " @entity0 said			1
' we are badly accustomed to always having the result in our favour			0
we have to be prepared to face adversity but it 's not easy			0
against @entity9 we got a painful punishment			2
we are sportsmen and we have no choice but to lift ourselves up			0
we have to fight in the next game which is our aim			2
we need to accept defeat with patience and tranquillity			2
' this is what i 've tried to transmit to the team			0
' make or break : @entity1 need to get a result in their next @entity5 game against @entity111 's @entity6 @entity0 's team defeated @entity6 2 - 1 in the group stages of the @entity114 in @entity115 , having lost their opener against @entity117 1 - 0			1
the difference this time , however , is that @entity1 are coming off their worst ever result in the competition			2
' we have enough experience , ' @entity0 said , ' and we have to combat their way of playing because @entity6 are a team that puts a lot of dangerous pressure			1
