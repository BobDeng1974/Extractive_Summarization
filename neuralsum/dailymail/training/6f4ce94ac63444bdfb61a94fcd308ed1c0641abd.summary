@entity1 supporters booed coach @entity2 and goalkeeper @entity3 but saw their team win 2 - 0 against @entity5 to stay clear at the top of @entity7			1
there were even a few jeers for an out - of - sorts for @entity11 when he blasted a second half free - kick over but the @entity13 set up the second for @entity15 after @entity16 had scored the first			1
those goals saw @entity1 move four points clear of closest rivals @entity21 in the battle for the @entity7 title			1
see how they got on as it happened from our live updates : @entity15 's goal helped @entity1 to bounce back from their 4 - 0 defeat to @entity30 host commentator three important points for @entity1 - and it puts them four points clear of @entity21			1
they , and @entity30 , play tomorrow			1
we hope you have enjoyed our updates , now switch over to follow our coverage of @entity40 vs @entity41			0
it 's currently 1 - 1			2
cheers ! that 's it			0
unconvincing but @entity1 still win with goals from @entity16 and @entity15			1
the worry will be @entity49 's injury			0
he ended the game walking around the pitch in just his socks after falling awkwardly			0
@entity1 are already patching together a back four as it is and @entity2 will hope he and @entity54 are back for the @entity56 tie with @entity57 this week			1
real left - back @entity49 is down after falling awkwardly in a challenge			2
@entity2 will be hopefully this is n't adding to their injury problems ...			0
@entity11 almost makes it 3 - 0			1
great run by @entity65 down the right , he crosses in for @entity11 to volley but it bounces just wide of the post			2
off comes @entity1 's second goalscorer			2
@entity65 is on in his place			0
@entity72 comes on for @entity73			0
he 'll be suspended for @entity5 's next game now after he brings down and on - rushing @entity11 a little outside the area			1
@entity76 will take the free - kick ...			1
and it 's theatrically punched away by @entity79			0
not bad for someone that 's renowned for being a bit greedy ... @entity83 off , @entity84 on for @entity5			0
goalscorer @entity16 off for @entity1 , to a standing ovation , replaced by @entity86			1
@entity11 breaks down the right but he ca n't find @entity15 to add to his goal			1
straight away @entity5 break though and they win a free - kick on the edge of @entity3 ' area			2
that should be enough for @entity1			2
@entity15 makes it 2 - 0			1
@entity11 knocks on a pass from @entity95 and the @entity96 dinks the finish over the keeper			1
that 's the three points in the bag			0
the @entity103 21 - year - old , signed in january from @entity104 , comes on for @entity105			2
a 1 - 0 win over @entity5 with @entity11 blasting free - kicks into the stand and struggling against a 39 - year - old full - back will do nothing to change the mood in @entity1			1
we 'll be in for another week of hand wringing and chin scratching if the result stays this close			0
shot from @entity49 but it 's easily saved by the keeper			0
he fought through a couple of challenges on the left and then shot when he probably should have passed			0
@entity15 then sees another shot saved by @entity79			2
they 're looking more threatening but these efforts are weak			0
21 - year - old @entity125 comes on for @entity126			0
he looks unimpressed , although he has faded since a decent opening			0
@entity11 steps up for the free - kick ...			1
@entity130 @entity16 made the difference at the attacking end earlier and now he 's doing it in his own box			2
he proves @entity1 's saviour to cut out a deep cross with an excellent touch			2
the @entity137 sings his name			0
real get down the other end and win a soft free - kick for @entity142 challenge			0
a few injuries in @entity2 's squad at the minute so he 's relying on the club 's youth to make up the numbers			0
@entity65 , @entity148 and @entity149 @entity5 have to start taking these chances during a strong spell for the visitors			0
@entity1 are now starting to get back into it as we reach the 55 - minute mark			1
slow start from @entity1 again and @entity73 hits the post with a left - footed strike inside the box			1
moments later @entity3 has to react brilliantly to tip away a header that deflected off @entity161			0
and we 're off ... can @entity1 add to their lead ? @entity163 has his shooting boots on for this second period			1
@entity40 lead @entity41 1 - 0 in the @entity167 courtesey of @entity168			1
you can keep up to date with @entity170			0
second half from @entity1 coming up ... they 've looked a little vulnerable and @entity11 's been all over the place but who cares ? real lead 1 - 0 courtesy of @entity16 's curler			1
@entity5 are playing some nice stuff but they ca n't get round that @entity1 backline and particularly @entity178			2
real try to break quickly from a @entity5 corner and @entity73 grabs at @entity180 and is booked			0
@entity11 goes down in the box and is warned by the referee for his protests			2
it looked a lot like a dive - he could probably do with half - time arriving soon			0
and @entity76 is now down just outside the box - again the referee did n't pay any attention to his appeals			1
what is up with the @entity192 winner ? he 's missed another chance here after @entity76 glides down the right , crosses in and @entity11 heads over			1
he could even have left it for @entity16 to volley ... that might have been a better shout			2
@entity11 may be looking a little out - of - sorts , and he 's tackled out on the wing again here , but @entity76 is taking up his slack			1
the @entity203 has already hit the bar and set up numerous chances for his team - mates , including @entity11 's embarrassing miss. @entity11 fails to finish from a yard out and @entity16 saves the day			1
it 's a boost for the team but @entity11 's miss wo n't have helped his state of mind			2
@entity5 should cave in now			0
@entity1 need a big win after those boos at the start of the game			2
@entity16 curls in the opener to finally give @entity1 the lead			1
the ball comes to him on the edge of the box and he gives @entity79 absolutely no chance , curling into the corner			0
just before that @entity11 had missed an absolute sitter on the line when set up by @entity76 - it looked like that opener just was n't going to come ! how is it not 1 - 0 ? @entity15 is fed by @entity76 and his first time shot is heading for the corner until it 's knocked out for a corner by a none - the - wiser defender			1
this time it 's @entity76 ... brilliant snapshot as he brings the ball out of his feet and @entity5 keeper @entity79 can only hit his effort on to the crossbar			1
he was hitting the bar at his birthday party last week , now he 's hitting the bar at the @entity137			0
moments after firing a bicycle kick over he smashes the woodwork after getting on the end of @entity49 's pass			0
@entity1 look to have woken up			2
the @entity247 champions are on the ropes here - it 's all @entity5			0
former @entity251 man @entity126 the latest to have a shot at @entity3 ' goal , but his effort flies over			0
we 're underway and @entity5 are almost ahead already ! a brilliant move down the right gives @entity1 all sorts of trouble and @entity3 has to get down at his near post to save from former @entity21 man @entity261			1
it 's been an unusually tough week for the @entity1 stars			2
that difficult defeat down the road at the @entity266 put huge pressure on the squad - who then went on to party the night away at @entity11 's birthday bash ...			1
perhaps not the wisest move			0
today should be a slightly easier task though against a 12th - placed @entity5 side			0
can the front three of @entity11 , @entity15 and @entity76 turn things around ? the teams are out with less than 45 minutes to go until kick off at the @entity137 as @entity1 look to get back to winning ways after that embarrassing 4 - 0 defeat to local rivals @entity30			1
@entity1 : @entity3 , @entity178 , @entity11 , @entity180 , @entity15 , @entity76 , @entity49 , @entity95 , @entity161 , @entity16 , @entity105			1
@entity5 : @entity79 , @entity280 , @entity142 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity73 , @entity261 , @entity83 , @entity284 , @entity126 .			0

@entity1 were beaten 4 - 0 by rivals @entity30 in their last @entity7 *fixture*
@entity16 gives @entity1 the lead with a brilliant curling effort
@entity15 dinks in a second , with @entity11 assisting
@entity11 , @entity76 and @entity15 are all starting
