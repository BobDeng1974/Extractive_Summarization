@entity8 and @entity63 , both migrant workers employed in bars on @entity5 , were paraded in front of the cameras and forced to take part in a reconstruction of the killings after apparently making confessions			2

' @entity8 and @entity127 , both 21 , show how ' they killed ' @entity60 and mr @entity18 mr @entity53 said it was crucial for the @entity34 authorities to investigate the killings in a ' fair and transparent way ' and keep the victims ' families up to date with progress			1
