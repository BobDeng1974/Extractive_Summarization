by @entity0 published : 12:35 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 16:24 est , 22 june 2012 @entity1 told @entity2 , from south west @entity3 , the missing money must be her own fault and refused to return it @entity1 has admitted it made an embarrassing blunder by blaming an innocent victim of fraud when more than £ 1,000 was swiped from her account			1
@entity2 was told the missing money must be her own fault and refused to return it , this is @entity13 reported today			1
@entity2 had £ 1,150 stolen from her account in more 30 transactions , but the bank claimed her pin was used and so accused her of being negligent , until this is @entity13 stepped in and @entity1 admitted it had blundered and the transactions were actually signed for fraudulently			1
in january when @entity2 tried to use her debit card and it was declined she immediately contacted @entity1 to find out what had happened			1
she was told that her debit card , which was shortly due to expire , had become invalid , as a new card had been posted out and used			2
but @entity2 had never received the card , let alone used it			1
it was then that she discovered more that £ 1,150 had gone from her account in a series of swift transactions over just two days			0
the bank tried to force the 32 - year - old , who lives in south west @entity3 , to accept liability by accusing her of being negligent with her pin			0
@entity2 , a publicity manager at @entity32 , had no idea that her replacement card had been sent and consequently stolen			2
she refused to accept that it was her fault			2
she said : ' i live alone and i ’ve never written my pin down or told any of my friends and family			0
i do n’t know how it happened			0
she was told that five transactions had cleared from her account , with a further 25 pending – a total of £ 1,152.30			0
each of the 30 payments was for £ 40 or just under			0
she said at first @entity1 told her the money would be put back into her account			1
she said : ' i thought everything had been sorted out			0
' a spokesman for @entity1 said : ' in this instance , due to human error the investigation was not undertaken properly and we incorrectly believed that the pin was used for the transactions			2
' but then a week later @entity2 was contacted by @entity1 , which informed her that because the correct pin had been used that she was liable for the full amount			1
@entity1 told @entity2 that because a replacement pin was not sent with her card and because no cash withdrawals were attempted that it may be someone she knows			1
she said : ' the person implied that someone else living in the property must have taken the card , a fact which i disputed as i live alone			0
or that i was guilty of negligence with my personal information and had allowed someone to gain knowledge of my pin , which i also strongly disputed			0
' error : a letter sent to @entity2 accusing her being negligent with her pin in a letter from @entity1 to @entity2 , @entity73 - @entity72 , a customer relations manager , said : ' the very fact that the card has been misused clearly indicates that the pin was not adequately protected against misuse			1
' @entity2 also contacted the police when the bank first told her that she would be liable			1
however , she was told that it was up to the bank to report this type of fraud and it would be up to @entity1 to contact them			1
it was then that @entity2 contacted this is money to see if we could help			1
initially when we contacted @entity1 , we were told that because @entity2 had used her pin she would be held liable and the money would not be refunded			1
' i live alone and i ’ve never written my pin down or told any of my friends and family			0
i do n’t know how it happened			0
' @entity2 @entity2 gave us a copy of the letter that @entity1 had sent detailing all of the transactions			1
there were 30 payments , all for around £ 40 – the limit which banks check for fraud if payments are unusual			0
some of the transactions were at the same shop within minutes of each other			0
they just did not look possible			0
this is @entity13 asked @entity1 to review the case one more time , from the very beginning to make sure that her pin had not been issued with the replacement card			2
its fraud team discovered that the transactions were actually authorised by signature and not pin , and that the signature was clearly not @entity2 ’s			2
it turned out that a mistake was made by a member of @entity1 staff during the initial investigation			2
a bank spokesman said : ' all @entity1 customers who are the innocent victim of fraud will be refunded their losses , however we do always need to investigate to ensure that it is fraud as we unfortunately receive many bogus claims			2
' in this instance , due to human error the investigation was not undertaken properly and we incorrectly believed that the pin was used for the transactions			0
' because of the other circumstances of this case , this meant that ms @entity2 was held liable			2
' we have since reviewed the case and discovered that the transactions were authorised by a signature which was not the customer 's			0
we apologise to ms @entity2 and have refunded the money to her immediately			1
' @entity1 have also given @entity2 £ 300 in the way of compensation			1
she said : ‘ thanks so much for all your help , i feel sure that i would have struggled to get any answers without your persistence			0

@entity1 refused to return cash to @entity2
she was told the missing money must be her own fault
