by @entity0 published : 03:39 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 09:31 est , 24 july 2013 fraudster : @entity3 worker @entity2 , pictured outside @entity5 sheriff court yesterday , was sentenced to 150 hours unpaid community work an @entity3 worker who lied about the death of her father in order to claim paid leave was yesterday spared a jail sentence for fraud			1
@entity2 , 45 , told her bosses he had passed away and she needed time off to attend his funeral in @entity17			1
but it later emerged he was alive and knew nothing of the scam			2
at @entity21 , @entity2 pleaded guilty to two charges of obtaining money by fraud from @entity25 between march 9 , 2011 and april 22 , 2011			1
yesterday , sheriff @entity26 told @entity2 , of @entity27 , @entity28 , that she had ‘ breached trust ’ – but would not go to jail over the fraud			1
he said : ‘ she ’s a first offender and has lost a great deal through all of this			2
‘ the sums of money at stake make it clear that for a first offender there would have to be more involved for a custodial sentence			2
‘ taking into account the fact there was a breach of trust – she was expected by her employers to tell the truth – i will impose a community payback order with 150 hours unpaid work			1
’ @entity2 had worked as an administrator at the @entity50 at @entity5 ’s @entity51			1
in march 2011 , she went to her supervisor @entity52 and told her that her father @entity53 had died and she needed time off to attend the funeral in @entity55 , @entity56			1
taking advantage of sympathetic colleagues , she then spun out several more weeks of paid leave			0
following the invented burial service , @entity2 told her boss she was suffering from stress as a result of her father ’s death			1
she even managed to produce medical certificates from her doctor , who diagnosed ‘ bereavement reaction ’ , to support her story			0
@entity2 kept the scam up for more than a month before she was found out			1
a source said : ‘ eventually , red flags were raised and an investigation was launched			0
there was no record of a @entity77 dying in the @entity55 area , as she had claimed			0
lies : ms @entity2 told bosses at @entity5 's @entity81 , pictured , that she needed time off to attend her father 's funeral despite the fact he was very much alive and well ‘ an investigator managed to track him down and he said he had n’t seen @entity2 for over 18 months before this all happened			1
’ @entity2 was later dismissed from her job and now works as a housekeeper			2
the court heard she ‘ knew her father ’s death was fictitious ’ and had invented the tale to get @entity25 to pay her despite her not being at work			1
mr @entity77 , of @entity97 in @entity56 , said after a previous court appearance : ‘ we are a little estranged from our daughter			0
she lives her own life , like a lot of children these days			0
we still love our daughter and would like her to get in touch with us			0
we have no way of getting in touch with her			0
‘ we are just very sad about it all			0
we are sad about the state she seems to have got herself into			0
’ earlier this year , a social worker who lied about six of her relatives dying within two years in order to get paid leave was struck off			0
@entity115 claimed that her father , mother , aunt , uncle , brother and ex-husband had all died , thus obtaining 66 days paid leave from @entity121			2
a @entity123 hearing found that she had provided ‘ misleading information ’ for a number of absences and retained payments for compassionate leave			0
@entity130 chairman @entity129 said she had shown ‘ little remorse ’ and that her fraud was particularly damaging as she should have been helping ‘ vulnerable individuals ’ .			2

@entity2 , 45 , told her bosses at the @entity50 at @entity5 ’s @entity51 she needed time off to attend father 's funeral
the administrator then took more time off for stress following his death
