by @entity0 as if snowboarding was n’t enough of a rush , one @entity2 thrillseeker has decided to do the sport using electric jet thrusters			0
@entity7 , the @entity2 ’s fastest snowboarder , set a world record earlier this year using electric engines at the @entity11 resort in @entity12			2
the @entity12 - born sportsman was able to reach a speed of 50.1mph ( 80.63 kph ) on a flat stretch using nothing but the electric thrusters to propel him			1
‘ but in reality , it 's not as bad as it sounds			0
you 're not going to take off and fly somewhere			0
’ the jet engine record attempt began when mr @entity7 was contacted by @entity33 from @entity35 - based @entity34			2
mr @entity36 came up with the idea for the device after he tried his hand at paramotoring and found he did n't like the experience of strapping a huge engine on his back			1
the jet engine record attempt began when mr @entity7 ( pictured ) was contacted by @entity33 from @entity35 - based @entity34 @entity45 said recent advances in lithium polymer battery technology have made it possible to power four eight - @entity50 motors			2
these each turn spin fan blades at speeds of up to 30,000 rpm			1
to use the device , the rider holds onto the central bar and controls thrust with either a thumb throttle or bite control			1
@entity36 , the inventor of the device , hopes the the thrusters will also be used to improve jump height and push riders up hills			1
' it 's like a jet on a runway , ’ he said			0
‘ it seems slow at first and before you know it you 're just going like a rocket			0
' he decided to develop his own thrust system that could be used by skiers , windsurfers , skater and snowboarders			2
‘ the thruster is a very powerful motor driving a fan , about 30,000 rpm , ’ mr @entity36 told @entity79			1
‘ a modern jet engine has a turbojet propulser module at the core of the engine and this drives a large fan at the front of the engine that generates most of the thrust			2
‘ electric motor technology has recently progressed to the level where the turbojet core can be replaced with a high power electric motor			0
’ @entity98 ’s latest prototype uses four 8 kw motor - powered thrusters , along with a lithium - polymer battery pack to power the motors			1
to use the device , the rider holds onto the central bar and controls thrust with either a thumb throttle or bite control			1

‘ i see devices like this becoming extreme sport devices to get up skiers up slopes and to go wind surfing when there ’s no wind			0
’ while the device is n’t currently on sale , @entity45 said it estimates a future retail price to be around $ 5,000 ( £ 3,000 ) and $ 10,000 ( £ 5,970 )			0

it could also be used by skaters , surfers and skiers while the device is n't currently on sale , @entity45 said it estimates a future retail price to be around $ 5,000 ( £ 3,000 ) and $ 10,000 ( £ 5,970 )			0

@entity7 used device to reach 50.1mph ( 80.63 kph ) on a flat stretch
system uses 4 8 - kw motors that spin fan blades at speeds of 30,000 rpm
rider holds onto bar and controls thrust with thumb throttle or bite device
