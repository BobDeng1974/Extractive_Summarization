@entity1 , 14 , suffered fatal injuries when he crashed with a @entity14 van in july last year during a family bike ride to visit a relative			1
@entity1 was riding down a steep path with five other people , including his father and aunt , when he was unable to stop as he approached the busy road			1
eyewitnesses described hearing @entity1 screaming as the bike went down the path at a speed of between 25mph and 30mph as he desperately tried to slow the bike down before colliding with the van			1
the schoolboy suffered catastrophic head injuries and died at the scene			0
the inquest in @entity34 heard that the group only ended up on the @entity36 at @entity37 , near @entity38 , @entity39 , where @entity1 was hit , because they had taken a wrong turn			1
@entity41 , @entity1 's father , told the hearing how his son had saved up the money to buy the long haul trucker touring bicycle to assemble himself			1
' we were always clear with him that the bike would have to be checked by a professional bike mechanic before it was deemed road worthy , ' mr @entity41 said			1
' it was always his intention to get it checked			0
' mr @entity41 , a writer , said @entity1 had taken the bicycle to one bike shop close to his home in the village of @entity56 , near @entity57 , @entity58 , on at least two occasions during july and to the @entity61 shop in @entity38 on the day he died			1
mr @entity41 , who is a cousin of former editor of the @entity64 newspaper @entity65 , told the inquest that in his view , having ridden the bike two days before his son died , the brakes were ' functioning ' but not ' optimal '			1
on the morning of the day @entity1 died , he said he told his son to get the bicycle checked by a professional			1
' i specifically said : " we are really concerned about the brakes			2
you must get the front and back brakes looked at			2
" ' he was hit during a family bike ride and father @entity80 said he was laughing and joking moments earlier mr @entity41 said @entity1 took the bike to a shop			1
' he said they looked over all the brakes and replaced a cable			2
i did n't have a go ( on the bike ) but i did try both front and back brakes			1
' i noticed they were much firmer now			0
i noticed the pads were now about 1mm apart			0
' mr @entity41 , an experienced cyclist , said that the day before his son died , in his opinion , there was ' no danger of a catastrophic failure '			0
' from my narrative he would not have had the problems he had on the wednesday if he had not gone to the bike shop , ' he said			2
describing the moments before the fatal crash , mr @entity41 said : ' i was right behind @entity1			1
we were talking and he was laughing and making jokes			0
' we were n't going that fast			0
we were cycling in tandem and then he was suddenly ahead of me			0

' from the moment he came out of the tree line to the moment he passed me was only a few seconds , ' he said			0
inquest heard that @entity1 had saved up to buy the self - assembled bike but his father insisted it be checked first to make sure that it was road worthy ' he was pumping the brakes and that made me realise he was in trouble			1
' he was standing up on the pedals			0
he was applying so much force to his brakes that he was trying to keep the bike stable			2
' i think i said to him words to the effect of " come off "			0
he made no attempt to steer off the path			2
he made no attempt to come off the pedals and put his feet on the floor			0
' @entity137 , owner of @entity61 , said @entity1 had come into the shop and asked him to look at the gears and the rear brakes but said the teenager had not mentioned anything about the brakes in general			1
' if that had been mentioned i would have suggested that the bike stay for longer , ' he said			2
mr @entity137 said he adjusted the gears because they were ' ticking ' and replaced a frayed rear brake cable and re-set them			0
' i stand by my work and everything i did was correct			0
when that bike left the shop it was in a perfectly safe condition , ' he said			2
under cross-examination by @entity154 , representing the @entity41 family , mr @entity137 said he did not hold any qualifications for repairing bicycles			2
