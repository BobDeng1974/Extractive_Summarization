secretary of defense @entity0 said wednesday that the problem of ' foreign fighters ' aiding the self - proclaimed @entity4 includes far more @entity5 than has been previously reported – at least 100 and counting			1
' we have acknowledged publicly we are aware of over 100 @entity5 citizens who have @entity5 passports who are fighting in the @entity10 with @entity4 forces , ' he said during a televised interview			1
' there may be more			0
' earlier estimates had only about a dozen so - called ' foreign fighters ' from the @entity5 scattered across the @entity10 in @entity4 army units			1
he had access to planes at @entity28 before he joined the @entity30 terror group a few have been killed on the battlefield , including 29 - year - old @entity33 @entity24 , was employed cleaning jetliners for @entity35 before he left the @entity5 to fight for the terror group			1
another , @entity36 , was killed in @entity25 weeks ago			1
it emerged later that he was a close friend of another foreign fighter , @entity39 , who was killed in 2009 after joining the @entity41 terror network in @entity42			0
all three hailed from the @entity28 , @entity43 area , in an area with a concentrated @entity46 population and at least one mosque tied to radical @entity49 ideology			0
the @entity50 reported six days ago that according to @entity5 intelligence and law enforcement agencies , ' nearly a dozen @entity5 ' had traveled to @entity25 to fight for @entity4			1
the @entity54 magazine put the number at 70 on tuesday , citing a mishmash of statistics from the @entity58 , the @entity60 - based @entity59 for the @entity61 , and the @entity63 - based @entity62			0
but hard numbers have been hard to come by , and @entity66 's admission sheds new light on the size of the problem			0
@entity5 officials have warned that @entity5 who could use their passports to bring the @entity4 fight back home pose one of the greatest homeland security threats to the @entity5 since the 9/11 @entity76 attacks in 2001			2
speaking tuesday at the @entity79 , @entity78 's chief spokesman said that the @entity5 officials ' have been focused on countering the threat ' for months			1
' the @entity82 in march appointed ambassador @entity83 as senior adviser for partner engagement on @entity25 foreign fighters , ' @entity79 press secretary @entity81 told reporters			2
' so there ’s been an intensive diplomatic effort to coordinate our efforts to confront and mitigate this threat			0
there ’s been significant operational collaboration between @entity95 , @entity96 and all of their foreign counterparts , including @entity98 , on this effort			0
president @entity78 drew criticism wednesday in @entity101 for backing off of his resolve to ' destroy ' @entity4 with a weaker pledge to make it ' manageable ' @entity36 ( left ) , who died fighting for @entity4 in @entity25 this year , was a high school pal of @entity39 ( right ) , who died fighting for @entity41 in @entity42 in 2009 @entity66 said wednesday that with so many @entity5 passport - holders able to re-enter the @entity5 after joining the @entity4 jihad , ' we ca n't take a chance ... on saying , " well , let 's technically define this			1
is it a real threat today or tomorrow ? " ' he reiterated the resolve of @entity5 officials including president @entity78 and secretary of state @entity116 to wipe the @entity30 terror group off the map			1
@entity5 's mission in @entity120 , @entity66 said on @entity121 , is ' not " contain			1
" it ’s exactly what the president said : " degrade and destroy "			0
' @entity78 caught flak on wednesday morning in @entity101 for waffling between hard - line and soft - pedal positions on the @entity30 group that has cut a wide and deadly swath through massive portions of eastern @entity25 and northern @entity120			1
the primary @entity5 objective ' is to degrade and destroy ' @entity4 ' so that it ’s no longer a threat not just to @entity120 but also the region and to the @entity5 , ' the president said during a press conference			1
but minutes later he said a successful @entity5 effort in the region would ' shrink ' the group 's ' sphere of influence , its effectiveness , its financing , its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem			1
' @entity78 arrived at @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 on wednesday ahead of a @entity149 summit the president was greeted by an @entity5 entourage led by @entity5 ambassador to the @entity154 @entity153 @entity156 @entity155 sen. @entity155 was among the lawmakers who lashed out later in the day			2
' terrorists who behead @entity5 are not " manageable , " @entity155 said in a statement			2
' they must be stopped , and we need president @entity78 to communicate a clear strategy and goals on how he plans to eliminate this threat			0
' @entity66 , meanwhile , clung to @entity78 's first statement while ignoring the second			2
' you 've got to destroy it , ' he said of @entity4 , ' because if we do n't destroy it , it will get worse			1
' the soft - spoken defense secretary stopped short of offering any guarantees , however			2
' vows are something beyond my mortal capacity of doing , ' he said			0
' we will do everything possible that we can do to destroy their capacity to inflict harm on our people and @entity183 values and our interests			0
' the @entity185 will achieve the @entity79 's strategic objectives , @entity66 explained , by cooking up a menu of tactical options for @entity78 to choose from			2
@entity189 ( left ) was beheaded in a gruesome video distributed by @entity4 this week , following a heart - rending videotaped appeal to the terror group 's leaders last week from his mother ( right ) ' our mission , ' he said , ' is to provide him those options and those plans to accomplish the mission of " destroy and degrade " the capability of @entity4			1
' and speaking of the growing number of @entity5 who have taken up arms against @entity5 interests and allies in the @entity10 , he conceded that ' this crowd is a dangerous crowd			1
' ' this crowd is as dangerous a group of people – beyond just terrorists – they are an army , ' he said , ' marrying this with an ideology and a capacity to do things			2
' ' they control half of @entity120 today			0
they control half of @entity25 today			0
we better be taking them seriously			0
' @entity78 will lead a @entity224 @entity223 meeting this month devoted to the question of how to handle foreign fighters and whether to restrict their movements			0
@entity154 prime minister @entity228 has called for new anti-terrorism powers to limit their access to the @entity154 and determine where they can and ca n't go			0
@entity116 said earlier in the day that @entity5 might would pursue the killers of two @entity5 journalists whose beheadings were captured on video and spread globally through social media			0
' [ @entity239 ] hose who have murdered @entity242 and @entity189 in @entity25 , ' he vowed , ' should know that the @entity5 will hold them accountable too , no matter how long it takes			2

@entity5 defense secretary hints that a growing number of @entity5 are taking up arms with jihadi army in @entity120 and @entity25 – more than 100 , up from just a dozen estimated a week ago
*insists* of @entity4 : ' you 've got to destroy it , because if we do n't destroy it , it will get worse '
backs up @entity78 's claim that the @entity5 aims to ' degrade and destroy ' the militant @entity30 group
@entity78 caught flak in @entity101 on wednesday for following that *proclamation* with a weaker goal of making it a ' manageable problem '
two @entity4 militants killed in recent weeks were @entity5
