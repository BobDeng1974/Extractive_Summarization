by @entity0 published : 06:32 est , 10 march 2012 updated : 13:20 est , 11 march 2012 mr @entity2 's dna was contaminated with the rape victim 's a teenager who spent months behind bars wrongly accused of rape after a @entity1 blunder has spoken of his ' relief , anger and disgust ' after the charge was dropped			1
@entity2 , 19 , was due to stand trial next month in connection with a sex attack on a woman at @entity16 in @entity17			2
his dna - taken in connection with a separate matter - had contaminated a sample from the victim while being processed at a laboratory run by @entity24			1
mr @entity2 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , is now considering taking legal action - and his lawyers are calling for a public inquiry into the blunder , which could lead to other rape and murder cases being reopened			1
mr @entity2 was arrested in @entity33 about three weeks after the october 2 rape and brought to @entity35 after the results of the compromised dna test were sent to cops			1
during interview he insisted that he had never even been to @entity35			1
but @entity24 , a company used by @entity40 to carry out scientific testing in thousands of cases a year , insisted there was a definite match			1
mr @entity2 was charged despite his denials			1
at the time he had been on bail for an unconnected matter of affray			0
after being charged with rape he spent nearly three months on remand , before beginning a year - long sentence for the affray			2
earlier this week , after finding out the evidence was contaminated , the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) formally dropped the case at a @entity35 @entity57 hearing			2
mr @entity2 was stunned to find out what had gone on via videolink from prison in @entity61			1
he said : ' i am relieved that i have been found not guilty - but then i always was not guilty			0
i defended the allegation from the moment of my arrest			2
' i am angry that i was falsely accused			0
i am angry about the amount of pain it has put me and my family through			0
' i sincerely hope that justice comes for the victim and that the true rapist is caught			0
' i am disgusted that it has taken this long for them to work out what went wrong			0
i now want to move on with my life and put this horrible experience behind me			0
' @entity2 's mother , @entity78 , said the allegation had left her ' distraught '			1
she said : ' i never for one minute believed he was guilty			0
i 'm really glad the truth has come out - but how they managed to contaminate the evidence is beyond belief			0
the teenager was held on remand at @entity86 , @entity35 , after being arrested ' i am very angry that my son has had to live through this experience and suffer the shame of being accused of being a rapist , whilst being locked up in prison			2
' @entity40 has already begun an internal review of a small number of murder and rape cases in which dna evidence assessed by @entity24 played a crucial role			1
the scope of that probe may be extended in coming days or weeks			0
@entity100 - based @entity24 , which works for police forces across the country , has also started its own internal investigation , which might mean reviewing scores or even hundreds of cases			1
the company has apologised and said it had ' taken steps to ensure that it [ the mistake ] can not happen again '			0
@entity110 , the @entity61 - based law firm representing mr @entity2 , said they were ' utterly astounded ' by the failings that led to his arrest , charge and detention for the rape allegation			1
in a statement the firm said : ' had his case proceeded to trial and had the jury accepted the dna evidence , he would have received a significant custodial sentence			0
' we remain fearful for any defendant indicted on dna or other scientifc evidence that has been processed , is being processed or will be processed through @entity24 's laboratory			2
we call for a public inquiry into the failings reported			0

mr @entity2 was arrested in @entity33 and taken to @entity35 for questioning
he *continually* denied the allegation and insisted he *'d* never even been to the city
@entity100 laboratory @entity24 has apologised for the error
other rape and murder cases could have been compromised
