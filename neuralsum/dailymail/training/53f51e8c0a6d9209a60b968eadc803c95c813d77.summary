@entity0 may be reluctant to speak out now , but when the @entity2 scandal exploded in 2012 , she loudly demanded a judge - led inquiry			1
she toured television and radio stations proclaiming ‘ we need to get to the truth ’ for the sake of child abuse victims			2
she flatly rejected any notion that attitudes had changed or that it was a ‘ different world ’ years ago , insisting even in ‘ historic ’ cases , there were lessons to be learnt			1
loud demands : @entity0 ( left ) was beating the drum for a public inquiry as @entity2 ( right ) was revealed in october 2012 to have abused children at schools , hospitals and the @entity21 silence : until now @entity23 has said only that the @entity25 's story is ' untrue and ridiculous ' but has refused to answer any questions , as have her husband , @entity27 ( pictured ) , and their @entity29 colleague @entity28 miss @entity0 even lectured @entity31 that , whatever injustices had occurred in the past , they should be dealt with now to protect others in the future			1
her battle cries of 2012 contrast sharply with her silence in the past week in the face of questions about her role in the paedophile - supporting @entity41 ( @entity41 )			1
miss @entity0 has said only that the @entity25 ’s story is ‘ untrue and ridiculous ’ but has refused to answer any questions , as have her husband , @entity27 , and their @entity29 colleague @entity28			1
in october 2012 , as @entity2 was revealed to have abused children at schools , hospitals and the @entity21 , miss @entity0 was beating the drum for a public inquiry			2
1978 briefing : the @entity41 legal officer @entity0 wrote this briefing paper on the @entity53 , which sought to ban child pornography			1
she argued that it would lead to an ' increase in censorship ' argument : the second page contains a paragraph saying that a picture should not be considered indecent if the model was not harmed recommendations : miss @entity0 's briefing went on that the @entity41 would argue that the @entity66 to protect children should be amended signed : the @entity29 deputy leader 's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered only an ‘ overarching ’ judge - led investigation into @entity2 ’s rampage of abuse would suffice , she argued			1
teachers , social workers and @entity85 staff should be legally required to give police all allegations of child sex abuse , a report into the @entity2 scandal will demand today			2
the report was commissioned by police and is based on interviews with more than two dozen of @entity2 ’s victims			0
they told interviewers that professionals who come into contact with children should be required to pass on any accusations handed to them			2
currently @entity100 lacks a ‘ mandatory reporting ’ law – meaning people who work with children can go unpunished if they fail to report abuse			0
such laws are common in parts of the @entity107			0
today ’s report calls for a dedicated reporting line for abuse allegations and improved training for police officers			0
on october 15 , she told mps debating @entity2 in the @entity115 : ‘ it is impossible to overstate the suffering caused to those whom he abused			2
no one should be complacent			0
‘ this goes wider than just the @entity21			0
there are still countless young women and men who have been abused but have never complained because they bear a great burden of shame , guilt and disgust , and fear that they will not be believed			0
‘ should not our strong and clear message to them today be : “ come forward now , seek the support that you need to address the wrong that has been done to you , and , in doing so , not only secure the justice that you deserve but protect others in the future ” ? ’ miss @entity0 also called for the @entity137 to be part of the historic investigation because @entity2 abused children at an @entity141 run by the @entity137			0
it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that any such inquiry , had it taken place , might have unearthed a letter sent to the @entity137 in april 1978			0
it was written by the legal officer of the @entity41 , one @entity0 , and it argued that child pornography should not be banned as ‘ indecent ’ unless it could be shown that the child depicted had been harmed .			1

denied attitudes had changed or that it was a ' different world ' years ago
even told @entity31 that injustices in the past should be dealt with now
@entity164 's battle cries of 2012 contrast sharply with silence in past week
there are questions about her role in the paedophile - supporting @entity41
