by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 , the ex-nanny who ' squatted ' inside a @entity1 family 's home after being hired off of @entity6 , is now out			1
@entity7 reported wednesday that @entity8 , 64 , is no longer living inside the @entity12 family 's @entity10 residence			1
some of her belongings are still there , the station said			2
@entity17 , 31 , told @entity18 in a june interview when @entity3 moved in things began well and she and @entity21 , 35 , baked a cake for their baby daughter ’s birthday with her help			1
the photo of the nanny grinning with the freshly baked cake has now been beamed around the world			2
@entity17 said : ' she moved in the week of march 4 and march 8 was my baby ’s birthday , so that picture was taken march 7 , we all made a cake together			1
it was fun , i thought how fun , we could do this again every year , i planned on her staying a long time , and she could have stayed a long time she just had to help me			1
' the nanny also settled in quickly and would use the family ’s swimming pool			1
@entity17 said : ' she would get in her bathing suit , come out have a beer with us , barbecue , music			1
she would sit in the layout chairs and sunbathe she would go in the inflatable and lie in the pool			2
' however the first signs of trouble came three weeks in when she began to refuse to do housework or watch the children if @entity17 - who had wanted to set up her own business at home - wanted to go out for meetings			1
my house is not very dirty … there was not a lot of work you had to do			2
' all of a sudden it was like ' ‘ it ’s so hot in here '' , '' you need to put the air on ' ’			1
' i would make her breakfast , lunch and dinner she never came and helped me prepare those meals , but she was there to eat it and this was from day one			2
' i asked her to clean her bathroom , she did it but then she threw a fit , she stomped out of the bathroom , went to her room , slammed the door and stayed in there the whole day and never came out …			1
. she said it was too hard			0
she was like a teenager , it was like taking care of another child			0
it was like she felt she was entitled to us taking care of her			0
' @entity3 did n’t mention her health problems when she took the job			1
stumped : @entity17 and @entity114 with their three children , ages , 11 , 4 and one @entity17 said : ' she never told me she had @entity119 ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) when i hired her , she told me nothing , she said she was perfectly happy			1
i said ‘ ' is there anything you can tell me that might prevent you performing this job ? ' ’ and she said no. ' on @entity125 even cooked the nanny a special meal			0
@entity17 said : ' he made her a steak dinner , he served her and he said ‘ ' happy @entity125 , and she said thank you			1
yeah it makes me angry , because we treated her like family we loved her			2
' @entity3 has even filed paperwork to try and force the @entity136 of their own home , pictured here @entity17 told @entity18 in june : ' @entity139 says ‘ mummy i do n’t love @entity3 anymore , i was going to marry her , but not anymore , she hurts my heart ’			1
' he ’s four , and he loved her , he loved her like grandma , he would give her hugs			0
they were real close and then all of a sudden she did n’t want nothing to do with them anymore			0
' @entity17 admitted she made a mistake hiring @entity3 but believed publicizing it as she has will stop the nanny from doing it to anyone else			1
she said : ' i buy a lot of things from @entity6 , i ’ve never met a psycho in my life except for her			0
' i called three references … i ca n’t get blamed for her not being honest with me			0
' i made a mistake as a mom , i ’m not going to be the first one who ’s made a mistake			0
' i ’m just the first mom to put it on public television and in the media , i own up to it because this can happen to anyone , not just a nanny , but anyone you have in your house			2
it ’s not about a nanny , it has everything to do about the law , that ’s my point			0
' asked what her message is to @entity8 , a defiant @entity17 said : ' if i could say one thing to her right now , it would be ‘ ' you can never do this again and get away with it , you will go the rest of your life now being labeled and i did this for everybody you victimized because it ’s not right			1
you ’re never going to do this again ''			0
' careful : mrs @entity17 , pictured with her children , said she carried out background checks on the woman while showing @entity18 the letter @entity3 gave her when she first tried to get rid of her , @entity17 said : ' she wrote me a letter , it ’s a letter of extortion i feel , telling me i can be at my house at this time and this time , and that i need to feed her healthy food or give her $ 200 , she wrote it to get me really upset , to get me furious and she did get me furious , but i did n’t respond to her			1
' she ’s playing games , she knows i have a very short temper and she ’s trying to wind me up , she ’s not going to do it because i know her game , i ’m not going to get wound up			0
' she ’s a liar in the upmost form			0
it ’s terrible there ’s people like that			0
i think she ’s a scorpion , it ’s just in her blood			0
' @entity17 did feel some pity for the nanny , adding : ' i do feel sorry for her , but she ’s not a very nice person			1
i wonder where it went wrong for her ? ' she told me her sister ’s swindled her too			0
she made me feel sorry for her			0
' i would love to talk to her sisters , because she ’s put her sisters through hell , i almost want to tell them this one ’s for them			2
' asked if she will ever get a nanny again after this , @entity17 said : ' no never			1
first of all , i would not want anyone to come in my house to live with me … i ’m not even going to have a houseguest			0
i ’ve been put off for life			2
' ' obviously there needs to be a law changed , we are going to go through a procedure and @entity231 is watching how difficult it can be to get someone out of your house			0
and that ’s a good thing [ as it might get the law changed ]			0

@entity3 , 64 , stayed put inside the home of @entity17 and @entity12 in @entity10 , @entity1 after she stopped working for them
police have said that because @entity3 was *invited* into the home and has established residency they are unable to do anything
mrs @entity17 claims she has been contacted by at least one other family saying they had a similar problem with @entity3
