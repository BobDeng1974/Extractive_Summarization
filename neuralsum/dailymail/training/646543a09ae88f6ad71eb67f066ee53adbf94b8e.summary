@entity1 star @entity0 maintained his brilliant form at @entity3 to remain in command at the halfway stage of the Â£ 5.4milllion @entity7 event in @entity8			1
@entity0 , who won all three of his matches in @entity11 's victory over the @entity12 in september , carded a second successive 67 to lie 10 under par , three shots ahead of @entity16 team - mate @entity15			1
the 35 - year - old @entity17 fired five birdies and no bogeys and has now played his last 11 rounds at the venue in 49 under par after finishing third in 2011 and again 12 months ago			1
@entity0 hits his tee - shot on the third hole during the second round of the @entity7 the @entity17 leads the prestigious tournament by three shots at the halfway stage @entity0 putts on the 18th green , where he made par , at the @entity28 on friday @entity15 , who was runner - up to @entity30 last year and won the title when it was staged at @entity33 in 2012 , birdied four of his last five holes to match @entity0 's 67			1
and double @entity35 champion @entity35 went one better with birdies at all five of the closing stretch in his 67 to finish six under alongside @entity39 's @entity38 , whose 65 was the best score of the week so far			1
@entity0 won the @entity41 in 2010 but has yet to win one of the @entity7 events and told @entity44 4 : ' it would be very special			1
the @entity7 's are a special tier of events , there 's no doubt about that and this has always been one i had my eye on			1
this one and @entity55 ( venue for the @entity57 ) are the two golf courses i feel i perform well on			0
@entity15 is making a rare appearance this year at the top of the leaderboard after two good rounds @entity12 @entity1 star @entity35 enjoyed a stunning run of birdies to close his round ' but this is a world - class field			1
they are bunching up behind me and i have to get out there tomorrow and keep the pedal down and position myself for sunday and give myself a sniff on the back nine			2
' asked to explain his remarkable scoring at @entity72 , @entity0 added : ' i think it 's the fact you do n't have to hit it a long way , you have to be accurate and i like these greens			1
i read them well here , this course is always so well presented and i just enjoy playing it			0
' i did n't play as well as i did yesterday			0
i missed a lot more fairways , which is a big key on this golf course			0
you must find fairways to have a chance out there			0
i got lucky a couple of times and i made some good saves			0
' it was n't my best ball - striking round but i hung in there and i 'm right where i want to be going into the weekend			2
' in contrast , @entity15 was delighted with his performance in his second tournament with new @entity101 clubs as he looked to put an injury - plagued campaign behind him			1
@entity38 of @entity39 plays his second shot on the picturesque eighth hole during the second round @entity106 of @entity107 plays out of trouble after hitting into the trees alongside the eighth hole @entity112 's partner @entity111 watches ' it was great			2
i played very , very solid , ' said @entity15 , who has slipped to 44th in the world rankings			2
' probably the best i 've played all year , which is very exciting			0
' it was a little frustrating the first 13 holes that i was missing chances , but four birdies in the last five holes , chances started to go in at the end , and i 'm very happy			0
' i played with @entity0 in the last round last year and he likes this golf course and played well , and i 've had success around here as well			1
so if you 're within six shots , then you 've got a great chance on sunday			2
' @entity35 was just level par for his round after 13 holes but produced a brilliant finish with five birdies in a row , which included using his four wood to ' chip ' in from the fringe on the 17th after a more orthodox chip in on the previous hole			1
' it was a struggle , ' said the left - hander , who finished eighth last year			2
' i hit some good shots but could n't make some putts			0
hit some bad shots and made some putts			0
and then to finish that strong , it was a great round of golf , or great last five holes i guess you could say			0
' it 's kind of like where i was last year			0
i was hanging around right there going into the weekend so i look forward to the challenge			0
hopefully i can play a little better this time on the weekend			0
' @entity155 2 @entity154 had closed to within one of @entity0 with four birdies in his first six holes , but ran up a quadruple - bogey nine on the eighth after a wild hook into the trees ended in an unplayable position and his fifth shot was stymied by a large rock in front of the green			1
the former @entity169 champion also double - bogeyed the ninth and dropped another shot on the 11th , but eagled the 14th and birdied the 16th in an eventful 72 that left him eight off the lead on two under .			2

@entity0 leads @entity7 by three shots
@entity17 shot second round of 67 to sit on 10 under par
@entity1 team - mate @entity15 is three shots back in second place
@entity35 on seven under after *incredible* birdie run and two chip - ins
