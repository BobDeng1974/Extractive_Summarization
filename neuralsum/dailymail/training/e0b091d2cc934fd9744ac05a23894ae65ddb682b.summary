a member of the @entity2 @entity1 was caught this week trying to make a rather conspicuous edit to @entity5 's wikipedia page			1
in a move sure to grind the gears of conspiracy theorists everywhere , a member of the @entity2 @entity1 recently edited @entity5 ’s wikipedia page from describing him as a ‘ dissident ’ to a traitor , according to the entry ’s changelog			0
the user ’s ip address was quickly traced back to the @entity1			2
it is not clear if the person is an active senator , a staffer or an intern , but the change certainly came from the @entity1			0
the attempted edit , made august 2 , was rejected by a moderator on the grounds it ‘ seemed less than neutral , ’ according to the posted rejection , which also listed the ip address and showed it was registered to the @entity1			1
it 's official : @entity5 's new refugee documents granted by @entity41 is seen during a thursday news conference in @entity43 in a somewhat transparent move , the edit came one day after @entity5 was granted a one year asylum in @entity41			1
while opinions may be divided on what @entity5 really is , @entity29 generally snuffs partisan edits out pretty quickly			0
other entries made by the @entity52 regular include deleting a word from the first paragraph of an entry for ‘ @entity56 , ’ clarifying that the @entity57 is part of the @entity59 , not the @entity60 in an entry for ‘ pork , ’ and correctly noting in the entry for the ‘ @entity64 ’ that the firearm is still ‘ in production ’ with ‘ 4 ” availability , ’ among others			0
the editor likely was n’t aware @entity29 tracks ip addresses and did n’t know the change would be tracked back to @entity72 – or maybe they did and it ’s all just part of a bigger conspiracy .			2

the editor 's ip address was tracked back to the @entity1
the edit was made one day after @entity5 was granted *political* asylum in @entity41
