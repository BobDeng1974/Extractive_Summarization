‘ the task and stress of leadership is considerable when you hear and see your comrades being killed … and how they fear being caught by @entity7 insurgents and knowing what they would do , namely skinning them alive , cutting off their testicles and displaying body parts in trees as a warning to other forces			0
’ mr @entity63 said the conviction was ‘ inherently unsafe ’ because a seven - man military board was permitted to find him guilty on a simple majority			2
