by @entity0 published : 04:28 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 05:30 est , 11 october 2013 an environmental health officer stunned a florist by claiming her display model of @entity6 ’s caterpillar was breaking anti-smoking laws			1
@entity8 , 32 , had put the wooden model of the hookah puffing character from the 1951 @entity12 movie in her front window to attract customers			1
but instead she got an unexpected visit from a council officer who noticed the model , which was sat on a wooden toadstool , was in possession of a real shisha pipe and looked as if it was smoking			1
not amused : @entity8 outside her flower shop , which a council officer suspected might be a shisha den as it has a wooden caterpillar holding a pipe in the window in the iconic cartoon movie the caterpillar blew smoke rings in the shape of letters and was famed for its phrase ‘ whooo … are … you ? ’ the council officer warned ms @entity36 that the wooden caterpillar might be in breach of laws preventing employees from smoking in the workplace and said he should investigate further			1
he also claimed the presence of a shisha pipe led him to believe ms @entity8 might be running an illegal shisha pipe ‘ smoking den. ’ ms @entity8 said she refused to let the officer investigate further , and instead put a flea in his ear - telling him to leave the shop , @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52			1
on friday ms @entity8 said : ‘ i could n’t believe what this man was saying			2
it was so surreal i thought i was in @entity6 myself at the @entity57 's tea party			1
‘ he told me he ’d come in to investigate because there had been a complaint that the shisha pipe was contravening @entity62 smoking in the workplace regulations			0
‘ i said , " but it ’s a wooden caterpillar , " and he said " yes , but it ’s smoking " , and i said " no , it ’s not "			0
classic character : the caterpillar featured in @entity12 's 1951 @entity6 animation and sits on a wooden toadstool in ms @entity8 's shop window ‘ i really thought someone was winding me up , i was n’t taking it seriously			1
‘ it ’s not even a real shisha pipe , it ’s an ornament , it does n’t work			0
‘ but he did n’t have a problem with the shisha pipe , it was the caterpillar smoking on business premises			2
‘ i said to him , even if it was a real caterpillar the chances of it lighting the pipe were pretty thin , but the fact that it ’s a wooden caterpillar renders it impossible			0
’ ‘ i would n’t let him investigate , i said to him " if you have n’t got better things to do , i certainly have , you need to leave "			0
‘ he said there was a real problem in @entity51 with shisha			2
i do n’t know if that ’s with caterpillars smoking it			0
‘ i did think about getting the caterpillar an electronic cigarette , or putting him on patches or something ! ’ the enigmatic caterpillar which was voiced by actor @entity104 in the @entity12 movie was part of a display which features several characters from the @entity110 books @entity6 and @entity111			1
its memorable phrase is a breathy ‘ whooo … are … you ? ’ was visualised as exhalations of smoke in the shapes ‘ o ’ , ‘ r ’ and ‘ @entity116 ’			0
@entity121 : the caterpillar blows smokey letters at @entity6 in the @entity12 film , before transforming into a butterfly @entity6 remarks in the original story that the @entity127 will one day turn into a butterfly and in the @entity12 film he does just that - albeit while angry from @entity6 ’s comment about being only three inches high			1
the caterpillar was played by actor @entity133 in @entity135 ’s flamboyant 2010 remake			0
@entity138 run @entity136 said the officer had wanted to check that the florist was not operating as an illegal shisha ‘ den. ’ councillor @entity143 , executive member for environment , said : ‘ the council public protection officer involved in this case was walking past the florist , saw the display and went in to make sure it was not operating a shisha lounge , which can be hard to detect			2
‘ the public protection officer was simply carrying out his duties			0
we have a job to do in regulating shisha so do need to check on these matters			0
