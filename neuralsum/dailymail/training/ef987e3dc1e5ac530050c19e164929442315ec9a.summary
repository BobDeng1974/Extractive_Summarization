by @entity0 the frustration of trying to download a film online , watching the progress bar move mind - bogglingly slowly , may soon be a thing of the past			1
scientists have created the world ’s fastest network that can download a movie faster than you can blink			2
@entity13 researchers achieved the feat by creating a next - generation optical fibre that transfers 43 terabits per second			1
scientists have created the world 's fastest network that can download a movie faster than you can blink , by using a new type of optical fibre to transfer 43 terabits per second experts at @entity23 said that this means that they could use it to download a one gigabyte film in 0.2 milliseconds			1
the @entity13 team used single multi-core optical fibre , which was developed by @entity30 firm nnt			1
this type of fibre contains seven cores - glass threads - instead of the single core used in standard fibres , which makes it possible to transfer more data			1
surpisingly , the fibre is the same width as a standard fibre			2
the researchers at the @entity41 have now reclaimed the record for the fastest network , having previously lost it to experts at the @entity45 in @entity46 , who created a network able to reach speeds of 32 terabits per second			1
to reclaim the title for the world ’s fastest network , the @entity13 team used single multi-core optical fibre , which was developed by @entity30 firm @entity53 ( @entity29 )			1
this type of fibre contains seven cores - glass threads - instead of the single core used in standard fibres , which makes it possible to transfer more data			1
incredibly , the fibre is the same width as standard fibre			0
the researchers say that the worldwide competition in data speed is contributing to developing the technology needed to accommodate the growth of data traffic on the internet			1
such traffic is estimated to be growing by 40 to 50 per cent every year , and is set to soar as more people use internet - connected devices in the home and technology in cars becomes more complex			1
the speed achieved means that the experts could use the network to download a one gigabyte film in 0.2 milliseconds , which is faster than the time it takes a person to blink			1
it is hoped that faster networks will make slowing loading screens ( pictured ) a thing of the past emissions linked to the total energy consumption of the internet as a whole make up more than two per cent of the global man - made carbon emissions , which puts it on a par with the transport industry			2
and these emissions are set to grow dramatically			0
‘ it is therefore essential to identify solutions for the internet that make significant reductions in energy consumption while simultaneously expanding the bandwidth , ’ the researchers said			2
physicists have claimed this week that optical fibre made of air could connect any point on @entity103 or in space , in the future			1
professor @entity106 says that an ‘ air waveguide ’ could enhance light signals collected from distant sources , making long - distance communication possible as never before			0
he believes such a breakthrough could allow colonies of people on @entity114 to communicate via a type of broadband , for example			0
the professor of physics at the @entity120 believes waveguides could have many applications , including long - range laser communications , detecting pollution in the atmosphere , making high - resolution topographic maps and even laser weapons			0
this is an illustration of an air waveguide			0
the filaments leave ' holes ' in the air ( red rods ) that reflect light			0
light ( shown by arrows ) passing between these holes stay focused and intense professor @entity106 and his team have found a way to make air behave like an optical fibre , which could guide beams of light over long distances without loss of power , according to the study in the journal @entity149			2
the air waveguides consist of a ‘ wall ’ of low - density air surrounding a core of higher density air			0
just like a conventional optical fibre , the wall has a lower refractive index than the core , guiding light along a ‘ pipe ’			2
the physicists broke down the air with a laser to create a spark and used the air waveguide to conduct light from the spark to a detector a three feet ( 1 metre ) away			0
the signal was strong enough so that they could analyse the chemical composition of the air that produced the spark			0
in fact , the signal was one - and - a - half times stronger than a signal obtained without the waveguide			0
while this may not seem a lot , over distances that are 100 times longer - where an unguided signal would be severely weakened - the signal enhancement could be much greater , the scientists explained .			0

researchers from the @entity41 used a new type of optical fibre to transfer 43 terabits per second
network could be used to download a @entity191 film in 0.2 milliseconds
previous record - breaking network reached speeds of 32 terabits per second
competition in data speed is contributing to developing the technology needed to accommodate the growth of data traffic on the internet
