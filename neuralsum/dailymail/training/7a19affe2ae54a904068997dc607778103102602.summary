a @entity1 charity supported by @entity2 and @entity3 is helping save the lives of hundreds of dreadfully injured and abandoned greyhounds in @entity6			1
some of the dogs have been tortured – burned with cigarettes and acid – some dumped to die in tunnels , hung in trees or released on busy motorways			2
others have been left with broken bones to starve to death			0
in at least one case , a rope had become so deeply encrusted in the neck of a greyhound it had to be surgically removed by a vet while dozens of others have had gaping , open wounds – the results of abuse - by the time they are found by volunteers across @entity6			1
' it is very disturbing but sadly typical of the kind of things that is going on			0
there is supreme neglect and cruelty on a large scale			0
' care : this injured canine is pictured being cared for by @entity38			0
many of the rescued greyhounds have been found homes with families in @entity1 and across @entity55 hope : the charity has helped save and treat between 6,000 and 7,000 greyhounds since 1998 tortured : ropes tied around the necks of the greyhounds caused horrific injuries			1
others had gaping , open wounds shocking pictures taken by vets and volunteers held in the files of the @entity36 - based charity greyhounds in @entity37 ( @entity38 ) show the scale of the problem that has seen the group help save and treat between 6,000 - 7,000 greyhounds since it was formed in 1998			1
many have been found homes with families in @entity1 and across @entity55 - all treated by vets in @entity6 at shelters supported by the group			1
disturbing new video recently obtained by gin and filmed undercover in the @entity6 countryside shows locally - bred hunting greyhounds , known as galgos in @entity6 , being held from the back of a pick - up on leashes and made to keep up with the vehicle as part of their training for blood - sport competition during the four - month long hare coursing season			1
when the video of the five greyhounds being ‘ dragged ’ from behind the truck was shown by @entity38 at the @entity97 in @entity98 , there was outrage			1
‘ they are awful pictures , ’ said @entity41 , of @entity38 , ‘ it is very clear that they are suffering greatly			0
‘ we hope that it will finally help open eyes to the kind of abuse that is going on			0
it is very disturbing but sadly typical of the kind of things that is going on with these poor galgos			0
‘ there is supreme neglect and cruelty on a large scale			0
' we have had cases of dogs being tied to rocks and left to starve to death , others with cigarette burns and some just thrown over fences and abandoned with broken legs			2
’ @entity38 works with a network of shelters across @entity6 where the primary rescue and treatments are carried out			1
dragged : new video filmed in the @entity6 countryside shows greyhounds being held from the back of a pick - up on leashes and made to keep up with the vehicle abandonded : when the hunting season is over , the @entity6 hunters often discard their greyhounds like ‘ cigarette butts ' , rescue workers say , buying new ones for the next season neglect : some of greyhounds are tied to rocks and left to starve to death , others are burned with cigarettes and some are thrown over fences and abandoned with broken legs it funds vets , treatment , shelters and care – and assists in finding homes with families of greyhound lovers in @entity1 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
among those supporting the organisation , which spends around £ 250,000 a year on saving the dogs – funding comes mainly from donations and two shops on the @entity169 run by the charity - is comedian @entity3 , who has highlighted the plight and mistreatment of greyhounds around the world on @entity175			1
oscar winning actress dame @entity2 , author @entity176 and actor @entity177 , a star of @entity178 – the owner of six rescue dogs - are among @entity38 ’s heavy - weight patrons			1
last month a shipment of eight dogs arrived at @entity38 ’s kennels at @entity184 , near @entity185 , while they await adoption with their details posted on the organisation ’s website			2
in @entity6 , they had been treated at shelters , sterilised , micro chipped and have been tested and found clear of @entity193 diseases before they come to the @entity1			1
not all are abandoned to die , some are left outside shelters because they are no longer of use and some merely dumped over the shelter fence – several broke bones in this way			0
others are rescued injured and terrified from dog pounds , known to rescue groups locally as ‘ killing stations '			2
one dog was found hanging from a tree while many are found with badly damaged legs caught in snare traps			2
‘ we hear some dreadful stories of how the galgos are treated , ’ mr @entity41 said , ‘ the standard of care is very low , the hunting season takes place in very hot ghastly conditions and once that is over there is often little need for the galgos			0
' we are not just talking neglect but cruelty			0
some have been tied up to rocks and left to starve to death			0
brighter future : some greyhounds have been found and treated with the help of gin but many , they say , have died fending for themselves new homes : eight greyhounds rescued by the charity are pictured here with kennel maid @entity233			1
they are waiting to be rehomed justice : prosecution for the mistreatment of animals in @entity6 is extremely rare and most people do n't seem to ' care or worry ' about it ‘ we are thankful for the goodwill of some very dedicated @entity6 people , who are often derided by the local community they live among because of their attitudes and work in trying to help the galgos			1
‘ yes , @entity6 is in @entity55 but these are often very macho rural communities and the welfare of the dogs is not a priority			1
' it is a problem that national and local governments choose not to address			0
‘ while some laws do exist concerning the mistreatment of animals , prosecution are extremely rare			0
it is just not something most people seem to care or worry about			0
’ one of the many cases highlighted by @entity38 , is that of is that of @entity262 , ‘ a lovely white galga ’ , ( a female ) that was found with a terrible slash in her neck from an incrusted rope in the @entity269 area of @entity6 popular with tourists			1
a volunteer found her and she was treated – the cost picked - up by @entity38			2
she made a full recovery and has been adopted by a family			0
‘ it was a disgraceful case , ’ said mr @entity41			2
when the hunting season is over , the @entity6 hunters often abandon their greyhounds like ‘ cigarette butts , ’ rescue workers say , buying new ones for the next season			1
the @entity284 is said to be the only breed of dog that is capable of maintaining a constant and fast pace in a run or race that can last up to an enduring five minutes			2
competitions are held nationally and locally with thousands hunting each year			0
help : @entity38 works with a network of shelters across @entity6 where the primary rescue and treatments are carried out			1
it funds vets , treatment , shelters and care – and assists in finding homes with families of greyhound lovers in @entity1 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 celebrity endorsement : @entity306 - winning actress dame @entity2 , author @entity176 and actor @entity177 , a star of @entity178 are among @entity38 ’s heavy - weight patrons in one competition , the dogs are held at pace by a man known as a ‘ soltador ’ riding a horse			1
he then releases them simultaneously to chase the hare – although the galgo that kills it is not necessarily the winner			2
dogs are awarded points for speed , overtaking , resistance , the tracking of the hare and the killing			1
the races , to be valid , must last a minimum of 55 seconds but can be as long as five minutes			0
the dogs can be disqualified if they behave in an irregular manner during the race			0
a galgo that does not follow the exact path of the hare and runs a shorter distance will receive penalty points and will not win			0
when this happens the @entity6 say that the dog is ‘ dirty ’			1
animal charities believe that at the end of the coursing season many dogs , even those chipped by owners and breeders , are abandoned and simply reported as ‘ missing ’			2
some have been found and treated with the help of gin but many , they say , have died fending for themselves			0
