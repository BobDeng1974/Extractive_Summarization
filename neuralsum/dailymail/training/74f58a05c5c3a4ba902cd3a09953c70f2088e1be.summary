by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 2 april 2012 under fire : mayor @entity2 has been accused of ' public health fraud ' over his use of dust suppresants @entity2 has been accused of ' public health fraud ' for ordering the use of dust suppressants to cut readings at pollution monitoring stations in @entity10			1
the @entity10 mayor could be avoiding hundreds of millions in @entity13 fines by ordering the use of sprays to cut the amount of dust in the air near pollution monitoring stations			1
but the tactic could also be putting the public at risk by masking the true extent of pollution levels in the city and preventing smog warnings when pollution is severe			1
@entity27 , director of @entity28 in @entity10 told @entity29 : ' this is deadly serious			1
we ’re talking about dangerous particles , some of which are toxic or carcinogenic , not inert house dust			1
' it ’s public health fraud on an industrial scale to use pollution suppressants in front of the air quality monitors most relied on to warn the public of smog episodes and report legal breaches			1
' the mayor needs to reduce pollution at source not hide it from monitors			2
' the tactic was revealed in a report by the mayor 's office recocomending the use of the sticky salt spray along busy streets , particularly during the @entity55			1
saline solution sprayed by trucks usually used for salting roads in winter makes fine dust particles stick to the ground rather than hover in the air			1
pollution hot - spots like @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 are among the 15 sites were the so - called ' dust suppressants ' are alreay being used			1
all of the sites are close to official air quality monitoring stations which measure the level of pollution in the city , mr @entity27 pointed out			2
he said @entity63 , in the @entity73			0
was the first to record a breach in air quality levels , while @entity64 , in @entity76 , is the location of the government 's own pollution monitoring station			2
pollution levels are measured in tiny particles of soot and dirt from traffic emissions			1
when inhaled , the particulate matter , known as @entity86 , can cause heart and lung problems			0
the daily limit of @entity90 in the @entity91 must not be higher than 50 micrograms per metre squared more than 35 times in a calendar year to meet @entity95 targets			0
@entity55 route : the first sighting of the dust suppressor truck on the streets of @entity10 even with the use of dust suppressants , on @entity65 this level has already been exceeded 32 times since the beginning of 2012 , while in @entity63 it has been exceeded 28 times , @entity28 in @entity10 claims			1
on @entity64 the level has been breached 25 times , according to figures provided by the campaign group			0
if and when the @entity95 quota is breached the @entity91 could find itself facing the @entity110 , which enforces @entity112 law			0
the country faces a fine of £ 300million if it fails to clean up its act			2
the @entity116 issued its first summer smog alert the weekend before last after high ozone levels were recorded			0
this kind of pollution , the most dangerous for athletes , occurs when sunlight reacts with pollutants			2
mr @entity27 said : ' @entity64 and @entity63 are at the absolute heart of the @entity55 road network			2
' @entity127 's plan for dealing with pollution during the @entity55 is to use the suppressor truck			2
' the mayor 's own pollution strategy recommends the use of the suppressants to achieve ' compliance ' with @entity112 standards			0
the document reads : ' there are other days where a location only just exceeds the @entity13 limit value			0
' in these circumstances a reduction in local emissions or concentrations ( for example , by preventing re-suspension ) will help achieve compliance			0
' @entity147 : the daily limit of @entity90 pollution on @entity63 has been exceeded 28 times so far this year dirty : the limit has been breached in @entity65 32 times @entity153 : and in @entity76 's @entity64 the limit has been exceeded 25 times			0
@entity28 in @entity10 believes this picture shows residue from saline spray mr @entity2 's office has said the suppressants are part of a short term strategy to cut pollution alongside long term measures to improve air quality like bringing in more low emission zones and planting more trees			1
his office told the @entity169 that having monitors at the busiest traffic spots made sense as it forces the @entity91 to clean up its dirtiest air , and that these were also the most important areas to use dust suppressants			1
but mr @entity27 claimed the suppressants were simply being used to avoid taking firm action on pollution			0
' what this is about is that actually we need to be focusing on the solutions , ' he said			0
' this is mainly a diesel problem and we need to be focusing on diesel emissions			0
' our low emission zone is two years and two steps behind the one in @entity186 and that 's the real test of whether we are getting to grips with pollution levels			0

@entity28 in @entity10 warns the tactic is putting public health at risk by masking true extent of pollution
