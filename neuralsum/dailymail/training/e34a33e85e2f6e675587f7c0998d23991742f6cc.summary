@entity4 , 34 , from @entity5 , once hated exercise as she loathed gyms , but since joining a running group she works out four times a week - and she 's gone from a size 20 to a 12			1
the finance professional began running with @entity12 in january 2013 , after realising she was struggling to keep up with her two young sons			1
@entity4 pictured before she joined the group in late 2012 ( l ) and recently ( r ) @entity4 , who lives with husband @entity15 and sons @entity17 , eight , and @entity18 , three , said : ' i had n't done any running since school and i 'd never done the distance i can do now			1
' i 've struggled with my weight since before i had my first child			2
' i was n't fit in any way and when i realised i was finding it hard to run around with my children i knew i had to do something about it			0
' i joined a couple of gyms but never went more than a few times and did n't enjoy it at all			2
' but then she learned about the group run by @entity36			2
' she starts you off really slowly - a two - minute run then a walk - and when i started i struggled even with that			0
but @entity36 's really encouraging and i did feel like i was progressing each week so i stuck with it			2
' once i saw some improvements , it made me more determined so i watched what i ate , and i do some of @entity36 's other classes now as well			0
' @entity4 ( left ) took up running two years ago and lost weight under the guidance of @entity36 ( right ) @entity36 and @entity12 have helped motivate @entity4 to exercise four times a week breakfast : big bowl of cereal lunch : shop bought sandwich and crisps dinner : large portion of barbecue chicken with lots of potatoes snacks : coffee with sugar full fat milk breakfast : scrambled eggs on toast lunch : pasta or salad with vegetables , chicken and cous cous dinner : salmon with greens and new potatoes snacks : coffee with skimmed milk @entity4 started in @entity12 's beginners ' group with the aim of becoming fitter			1
since then she has become a keen runnner , dropping four dress sizes and three stone , going from 15st 4lbs to 12st 4lbs			1
@entity4 hopes to get to 11st ' i 'd love to lose another stone and hover around the 11st mark			1
i 'm not so much focussed on my weight ; rather on inches and fitness , ' says @entity4			1
' my eating habits have n't changed that much - thought i started having skimmed milk in my coffees and reduced my portion sizes at dinner			0
i also stopped having cereals for breakfast because of their sugar content - and despite having a big bowl in the morning i was always starving come noon			0
' i will never set foot in a gym , but i exercise a lot			2
' i go to the running group on a monday and on a tuesday i do @entity36 's kettlebells class and on wednesday i lead my own group running			1
on a friday i do @entity36 's metafit class - a programme on a cd			0
' this year , @entity4 's taken part in 5k and 10k events regularly and was delighted to complete the @entity3			1
the route starts in @entity112 , then takes in the iconic @entity113 , passes by the famous @entity114 , and finishes in the coastal town of @entity116			0
@entity4 's now trained with @entity117 to lead her own @entity12 class of beginners and intermediate runners as a qualified instructor			1
she said : ' when i signed up for the @entity3 i thought i would only do it once			0
' it was the furthest i 've done and it was incredibly hard work training for it			0
' but i think i might do it again			0
it 's the feeling when you complete a challenge like that , there 's nothing like it			0
' i just love that i can run around with my children now and taking the running groups is going really well			2
if i can do it , anyone can .			0
