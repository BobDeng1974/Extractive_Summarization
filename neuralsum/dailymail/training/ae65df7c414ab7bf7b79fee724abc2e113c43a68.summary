by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 15:52 est , 10 january 2014 a seven - year - old girl has captured the hearts of people around the globe after an adorable letter she wrote to scientists asking them to ' make her a dragon ' was published on the internet			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , wrote to her country 's national science agency ( @entity13 ) before @entity15 with her delightful request			1
she wrote : ' hello lovely scientist ... would it be possible if you can make a dragon for me ? i would like it if you could but if you ca n't that 's fine			1
i would keep it in my special green grass area where there are lots of space			0
i would feed it raw fish and i would put a collar on it			0
' if it got hurt i would bandage it if it hurt himself			0
i would play with it every weekend when there is no school			2
' the little girl included a drawing of how she imagined the dragon would look , pointing out that ' the face should be black '			0
the science agency revealed the letter on their website where they included the response they sent back to the school girl , apologising that : ' over the past 87 odd years we have not been able to create a dragon or dragon eggs			1
' they added : ' we have sighted an eastern bearded dragon at one of our telescopes , observed dragonflies and even measured body temperatures of the mallee dragon			2
but our work has never ventured into dragons of the mythical , fire breathing variety			0
and for this @entity12 , we are sorry			0
' cute : the little girl 's letter addressed to ' lovely scientist ' next best thing : the agency made her a 3d model of a dragon instead but after @entity10 's letter went viral , prompting responses from countries around the world , the scientists decided to try a bit harder to make @entity10 's dream come true			1
while they could n't create her a real dragon , they did the next best thing , making a her a 3d model out of titanium that will be able to fly			1
@entity100 , @entity13 additive manufacturing operations manager , wrote : ' @entity35 came into the world at @entity102 , our additive manufacturing facility in @entity105			2
the scientists there have printed some extraordinary things in the past - huge anatomically correct insects , biomedical implants and aerospace parts			0
so they thought a dragon was achievable			0
' being that electron beams were used to @entity115 her , we are certainly glad she did n't come out breathing themâ € ¦ instead of fire			0
titanium is super strong and lightweight , so @entity35 will be a very capable flyer			0
' they added that they hope @entity10 will maintain her interest in science when she grows up			1
@entity10 's mother , @entity127 , told the @entity128 that her daughter was delighted with the agency 's response and now she and all her friends ' want to be a scientist '			1
' @entity10 says she now wants to work in the @entity13			1
she 's saying @entity12 scientists can do anything , ' she said .			2

scientists *replied* to apologise for yet being unable to make a dragon
but made her a 3d model from titanium
