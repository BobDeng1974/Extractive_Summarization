by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 30 september 2013 a @entity2 school has solved its problem with a lack of space for a school sports day by using the emergency lane of a nearby motorway			2
the @entity9 , in @entity10 , @entity12 province , is a school that mainly has children from rural migrant workers in the city and therefore does not have a lot of resources			1
it did have a small playground , but this ended up being built on , leaving the kids with nowhere to exercise until teachers came up with the bright idea of using part of the local motorway			2
risky : running races at the school take place on the emergency lane of the motorway there are about 500 students in the school , but without even a small playground the children need an alternative location			2
the local council could only tell them that there was nothing suitable where the children could enjoy running or any other form of exercise			0
@entity41 , 56 , said : ‘ we rarely organised sports which require a larger space than we have available			0
but we were then told that we faced closure if we did not do something as it ’s the law that primary school students should have physical fitness test			1
there was nowhere else we could go			0
‘ we always stage events after rush - hour and will make sure that teachers stand along the edge of the emergency lane to make sure cars realise the children are there and drive carefully			1
’ lack of resources : the school , @entity12 province , does n't even have a playground duty - bound : the headteacher said that the school faced closure if it did n't host sports lessons the school has now organised several races where the kids have a running test on the road bridge despite the busy traffic			1
‘ we know it ’s dangerous and is also not that healthy with all the smog , but we do n’t have any other choice if we are to stay open			0
poor : most of the children belong to low - income rural migrant families			0

the @entity9 , in @entity12 province , does n't even have a playground
the headteacher said the school faced closure if it did n't hold @entity87 lessons
events are always staged after rush hour , to *minimise* the risk
