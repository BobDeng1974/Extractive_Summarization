@entity0 face a summer of turmoil and uncertainty as owner @entity3 officially put the club up for sale			1
transfer business has been put on hold and manager @entity8 ’s position was cast into doubt after the @entity12 billionaire said he wanted to leave behind the ‘ fickle ’ business of @entity15 football			1
he compared himself to a @entity16 , a biblical person of wealth who is well - respected in society , and wants to ‘ get on with other aspects of my career ’ after several years of ‘ week in , week out battles ’			2
scroll down for the full statement selling up : @entity3 has formally announced his intention to sell @entity0 after eight years in charge uncertain : the decision to sell leaves @entity8 's future looking uncertain , especially since @entity0 could only finish 15th in the @entity29 unspectacular : @entity0 finished 15th in the @entity29 , just five points above the relegation zone transfer fees spent : £ 200million biggest signing : @entity34 ( 2011 ) £ 24million biggest sale : @entity36 ( 2010 ) £ 26million highest finish : 6th ( 2008 , 2009 , 2010 ) @entity3 has been searching for a buyer for months , and talks with an associate in the @entity12 stalled , but has now made public his intentions in a bid to attract concrete offers in the region of £ 200million			1
@entity45 have been tasked with handling the exchange but no timescale has been placed on the purchase , and with such a large amount of money at stake any conclusion is not likely to come quickly			0
that renders @entity8 ’s ambitions to move on transfer targets extremely difficult and third parties have been made aware that any potential deals will not be acted upon with budgets unclear			2
@entity8 has repeatedly stressed that significant investment in the playing squad is required to lift the team out of a fifth consecutive season of struggle next year			1
@entity3 ’s confirmation places @entity8 ’s role under greater scrutiny , however , with no assurances given that the 44 - year - old @entity68 would remain in charge if a new owner was found			1
last month @entity8 said : ‘ listen , if a new guy comes in and does n’t like you … it ’ s not something i ’ve ever thought about it			2
i ’ve not been a part of that but as far as i ’m concerned , i want to be here			0
’ the club took also took the last - minute step of cancelling the end - of - season awards dinner scheduled for tonight , in light of the statement from @entity3			1
tickets for the bash , described as the biggest event in the club ’s calendar , cost £ 85 per head and have been sold out for some time , but @entity0 decided it was not in good interest to throw a party			1
familiar feeling : @entity93 and @entity94 restart the game during @entity0 's 3 - 0 loss at @entity97 the @entity16 woman was a wealthy and well respected person in the society			1
this is how the @entity101 described her			0
the @entity104 woman 's life teaches important lessons about these three essential qualities : contentment , a kind of heart , persistence @entity3 , former @entity112 owner , bought @entity0 for £ 62.6m to own in 2006 and invested some £ 217m in his search for @entity115 football under @entity116			1
but since 2010 he has reigned in spending and rarely been seen at @entity118			0
in the latest accounts for @entity3 ’s holding company @entity0 debts to him stood at £ 179m , but he converted £ 90m worth into equity last december			1
it is not clear whether the asking price covers this substantial debt			0
@entity125 believe there will be no shortage of interested buyers from across the globe – and in promotional material stated the club has ‘ almost 1m known supporters ’ , but it remains to be seen if a bid to match @entity3 ’s thinking is lodged			1
‘ i have come to know well that fates are fickle in the business of @entity15 football , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ and i feel that i have pushed mine well past the limit			0
the last several seasons have been week in , week out battles and having now come through this last season unfortunately limping amidst very meaningful injuries and constant sale rumours , i feel further that now is the time for me to look for new ownership and thus new leadership			1
‘ i have asked the world of @entity8 and @entity148 and they have both delivered selflessly			2
on a personal level it is time for me , like the @entity16 , to dwell among my own and get on with other aspects of my career , following a sale			0
‘ above all , the debt i owe @entity0 whether as owner , chairman , custodian or simply as a fan is to put the @entity160 first			1
to make good on that debt , i owe it to @entity0 to move on , and look for fresh , invigorated leadership , if in my heart i feel i can no longer do the job			0
’ not amused : @entity0 fans , many in fancy dress , chanted ' we want our @entity0 back ' during the defeat to @entity97 several weeks back i said that following the end of the season i would clarify my future role with the club , and address what had become seemingly constant rumours of a sale			1

to make good on that debt , i owe it to @entity0 to move on , and look for fresh , invigorated leadership , if in my heart i feel i can no longer do the job			0
during my time with @entity0 , i have tried to strengthen and improve the club 's physical infrastructure both at @entity118 and @entity210 while also trying to carry on the @entity212 tradition of being mindful of the local community we serve			1
above all in this effort is the connection the club has made with @entity218 ; the caring , kindness and warmth that players , staff , managers and supporters have shown to mr @entity226 and @entity218 has wiped away all disappointments and sobered my finest memories			0
still , i can see now that it is time , if possible , to hand these privileges and responsibilities to the next person or group to take the club forward			0
i am appreciative of the support i have received , even in these last years of comparative struggle when criticism was due , and will look on with others - with fingers crossed , for stronger future performance appropriate to our size and heritage			0
on a practical level , the club will continue with its normal operations and plans for the summer			0
i 've no doubt that the core staff at both @entity118 and @entity251 , to whom i owe a massive debt of friendship and loyalty , will continue to guide and protect the club through this period of transition according to their collective sense of professional pride and long term service to @entity0 - the vast majority having preceded my tenure			2
finally , in light of the above , i have engaged @entity45 to advise on the sale of @entity0 .			2

@entity3 has announced the club has been put up for sale
the @entity12 joined the club in 2006 , taking over from @entity271
he has spent around £ 200million on players during his eight years at @entity0
