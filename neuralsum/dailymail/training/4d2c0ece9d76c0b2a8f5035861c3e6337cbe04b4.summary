@entity1 's panegyric on @entity2 in the minutes after the @entity4 @entity3 was a classic of its kind			1
' @entity2 is unbeatable , ' said the @entity8 chairman , dogmatically			1
' it 's very simple			1
he 's getting better and better every race			1
he makes no bloody mistake whatsoever			2
he knows what he 's doing			1
he 's got a strong personality			1
' @entity15 tried every trick today to get him			2
and he did a good job , but he could n't pass him			2
' getting the job done : @entity2 leads the drivers ' championship after winning the last four grands prix gap : @entity2 holds off @entity24 in @entity4 even if you cavil about @entity2 being ' unbeatable ' , the thrust of @entity1 's argument can not be denied			1
his comments could be taken as @entity24 being told by his boss that he is unfavoured by the team			1
i am not so sure			2
if @entity24 were to beat @entity2 repeatedly , @entity1 would be just as glowing in his appreciation of the @entity33			1
that is the @entity1 way			1
everything is full - throttle			2
we should also remember that there is an instinctive desire among some high - ups at @entity8 to produce a @entity42 champion			1
that is why they sought to jettison @entity45 when they bought the team from @entity48 at the end of the 2009 season			2
his departure made way for them to bring @entity54 out of retirement to partner @entity24			1
@entity24 's problem is not that he is being treated as a second - class citizen but that , by small margins in the most demanding of circumstances , he is driving like one			1
taking time out : @entity24 is pictured with fiancee @entity62 during a break in @entity64 , @entity65 this week the launch this week of @entity67 , the electronic series that will race in 10 cities around the world from september , has shown it has one advantage over @entity72 : it can be unashamed about its ' green ' agenda			1
organisers admit it will barely make more noise than rustling paper			2
@entity72 , meanwhile , tried to raise the volume by ( unsuccessfully ) testing a megaphone in @entity79 this week			0
some , including @entity80 , say the lack of noise is a turn - off ; others , led by @entity80 's old mucker and former @entity87 president @entity86 , say the muted engines are positive because they are ear and family friendly			1
@entity67 accepts that the fastest their cars will go is 135mph			0
they also acknowledge that their batteries – a technology that is developing slowly – will not last the race distance			0
so drivers will get out of one car and into another after 35 minutes			0
on the other hand , @entity72 frets that some of its cars are slower than some gp cars despite going above 200mph			0
@entity67 , being new , can escape without a public outcry for shortcomings that would see @entity72 , the world 's premier series , not only scrutinised minutely but lampooned			2
it also shows that @entity67 knows its own mind			0
it is not burdened by its past			0
it can merrily fill a niche without worrying about its broader role in the motor - racing firmament			2
that freedom is something that @entity72 – confused and torn – can only envy			0
limit : @entity67 accepts that the fastest their cars will go is 135mph my two most mesmerising annual experiences at trackside were , first , standing in the tunnel at @entity126 as the cars roared through and , secondly , watching them dance through the swimming pool complex just down the road			0
the first shook your entire body from toes to brain			0
it was so loud that one @entity136 journalist partly lost his hearing			0
the noise level will obviously not be the same this year given the new , quieter engines			0
but what about the second experience ? will the cars look so brutish yet still light on their feet ? will they still brake and accelerate at a speed you can not find anywhere else in motor racing ? i shall report from the pit lane on my findings			0
picture that : the iconic surroundings for @entity154 will play host to next week 's @entity126 @entity156 , @entity157 's de facto team principal , hosted a private dinner for a few of us hacks in @entity79 last weekend			1
what precisely was said remains off the record			0
however , i can report perhaps the most important factor in his attempt to restore the team 's fortunes : he has a sharp and perceptive mind			1
he has detected what was wrong and how to put it right			0
it is a big job			0
vision : @entity156 joined @entity157 from @entity175 as the @entity177 team constructor look to revive their fortunes my colleague @entity179 is not a visitor to the paddock			2
that may explain why on page 187 of his excellent book simply @entity190 , an a to z of @entity186 there is no entry between ' @entity192 and @entity193 ' and ' it is obvious that '			0
the word i would have included is ' issue '			0
it is misused by @entity72 drivers and teams as a synonym ( or is it a euphemism ? ) for ' problem ' , as in : ' we had a fuel / tyre / overheating issue today			0
' i imagine @entity179 would share my distaste for another phrase prevalent in @entity72 : ' for sure ' , the filler used by drivers during their press conferences in such sentences as : ' for sure , we will try our best			0
' @entity210 , i seem to recall , was a pioneer of this usage			0
i propose that the @entity87 introduce the equivalent of a swear box to deal with these linguistic failings			0
guilty party : @entity217 's @entity210 is prone to using the phrase , ' for sure ' , during a race weekend @entity221 presenter @entity220 , a motor - racing enthusiast , was in @entity126 this week to buy the original 1974 @entity223 , one of only three cars in the 308 and @entity226 series			1
@entity228 's son @entity227 , who has returned from living in @entity229 to restart his track career in endruance racing , said he was ' very glad ' @entity220 had added his father 's old car to his extensive collection			1
he paid £ 230,000 for the privilege			1
under the hammer : @entity220 bought the iconic 1974 @entity223 308 - 1 when it went under the hammer at a glittering auction laid on by @entity240 and air partner during the @entity3 de @entity242			1

@entity1 claimed @entity2 is ' unbeatable ' after he won in @entity4
@entity24 now trails the @entity245 in the championship by three points
@entity2 has finished *ahead* of his @entity8 team - mate at the last four races
*broadcaster* @entity220 has paid £ 230,000 for @entity228 's 1974 @entity223
