by @entity1 reporter published : 16:46 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 16:46 est , 8 november 2012 a war hero who risked his life to help transport crucial supplies to @entity5 in the @entity6 has been told by the @entity7 that he can not accept a medal for valour			1
@entity10 , now 88 , was one of the gallant seamen who braved @entity13 submarines and sub zero temperatures as part of the @entity19 @entity18 convoys			1
the perilous sea campaign , nicknamed the ‘ @entity25 ’ , claimed 3,000 lives , but mr @entity10 , who joined the @entity22 when he was 18 , and was a gunner on the escort carrier @entity24 , survived despite being shot			1
valour : @entity10 , 88 , has been blocked by the @entity7 from accepting the medal from the @entity5 mr @entity10 joined the navy when he was just 18 and took part in the famous ' @entity25 ' supplying @entity5 troops he was delighted and honoured when the @entity5 @entity31 wrote to him to tell him they intended to honour him and other veterans with the @entity33 , as a symbol of the country ’s gratitude			1
but the @entity7 has blocked the @entity5 government ’s plans because it said it would break rules surrounding the acceptance of medals ' after all these years i was honoured when the @entity31 contacted me to say i was going to receive the medal as a token of thanks for what i and others did for their country in the @entity6 , ” said mr @entity10 , from @entity49			1
' the @entity19 @entity18 convoy was often described as the worst journey in the world and that about summed it up			1
' the conditions were terrible , it was unbelievably cold , like working in a freezer and the sea was ferocious			0
once you started on a convoy you did n’t have a wash for six weeks because you could n’t get your clothes off , it was too cold			2
' the journey was fraught with danger			0
it ’s a part of the war that is n’t mentioned and seem to have largely been forgotten			0
i do n’t think people realise what an important job we did and the difference it made to the war			0
' we kept @entity5 supplied with food and arms and there is no doubt in my mind that without the convoys the outcome of the war would have been very different			1
' the @entity5 would have been crushed and the @entity13 would have taken this country too and we would be all be speaking their language			2
@entity10 was a seaman on the @entity24 and endured torpedo infested waters and sub zero temperatures to assist @entity5 soldiers those who took part in the @entity19 @entity18 convoy ran a gauntlet of u-boats and vicious weather conditions to bolster efforts on the @entity97 ' thousands died , i saw comrades killed			1
i was shot through the cheek and the bullet shattered all my back teeth			0
i had to stay on the ship for a fortnight until i got any proper treatment but i was one of the lucky ones			0
” added mr @entity10 : ' i feel proud that the medal is being awarded but i feel let down that i can not receive it			1
i think its ridiculous and typical of this government			0
' the @entity7 need to have a serious re think about it			2
this is a medal for valour but that does n’t seem to matter much these days			0
' @entity5 has already awarded the @entity114 to veterans from @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity119 spokesman for the @entity7 said : ' @entity120 appreciate the @entity5 government ’s wish to recognise the brave and valuable service given by veterans of the @entity125			1
' but permission to accept a foreign award can not be given unless there has been specific service to the country concerned within the previous five years			0
” the spokesman added that the @entity125 veterans were eligible for the @entity6 @entity133 but the veterans argue that men who served in the @entity125 had already earned the @entity133 before being conscripted on to the dreaded ‘ @entity25 ’			0
a @entity5 @entity31 spokesman said the situation was ' regrettable			2
but added they would continue to make the case for the award to the @entity19 authorities .			2
