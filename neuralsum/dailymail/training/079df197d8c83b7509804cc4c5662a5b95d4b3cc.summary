an @entity0 who veterinarians said could n't have puppies has just delivered a litter of 18 miracle mutts			1
the @entity7 family of @entity8 , @entity9 , were sad when a vet told them their three year old dog , @entity14 , was unable to breed			1
' she was n't going to have any puppies , ' @entity7 said of the 150lb pet , adding that because of the vet 's prediction , she and her husband , @entity17 , ' were n't concerned with separating her from our male			1
' but @entity14 had other plans			2
and the surprises just kept coming			0
unable to get the dog onto the x-ray table because of her size , the vet estimated she was having 11 puppies			1
so the @entity7 began preparing for the mass delivery			0
' i was really excited because of the experience and everything that goes along with having a litter , ' @entity7 told @entity50			2
last thursday , the couple took @entity14 to the vet because she looked to be unwell			2
when they arrived there was another , scary surprise			0
he told them he was going to perform an emergency c - section in an effort to save @entity14 and save the puppies			1
' i was an emotional basket - case , ' @entity7 said			2
' i was just sitting in the waiting room not really knowing what was going on			0
' dad : she and @entity35 , the @entity65 's male @entity0 , pictured , found love and before long she was pregnant all hands on deck : the @entity37 are pitching in to help the busy mother care for her enormous litter , bottle feeding the pups every three hours as @entity14 recovers from the c - section @entity14 nearly did n't make it , but thankfully the vet delivered the pups and some good news - they were all fine and healthy , along with their mom			1
however , he also delivered perhaps the biggest surprise of all - that @entity14 's 11 puppies were in fact 18			1
' i laughed and thought he was playing and picking at me , ' @entity7 said			0
' but he was telling the truth			0
' the @entity37 are pitching in to help the busy mother care for her enormous litter , bottle feeding the pups every three hours as @entity14 recovers from the c - section			1
' the first thing i do every morning is get up and walk in and make sure they 're still alive , ' @entity7 said			0
' it 's just gratifying to know that you 're taking care of them , giving them what they need and that they 're surviving and making it to another day - very gratifying			0

the @entity7 family of @entity8 , @entity9 , were sad when a vet told them their three year old dog , @entity14 , was unable to breed
but not long after they left her with their male @entity0 , @entity35 , she became pregnant
the vet said she was having 11 puppies but after she went into labor 18 puppies were delivered by emergency c - section
the family is now helping to bottle feed the massive litter while @entity14 recuperates from the *operation*
