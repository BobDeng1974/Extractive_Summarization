@entity1 will ' pick your pocket on a frequent basis ' because he wo n't cut benefit spending , @entity0 claimed today			2
the prime minister said he ' made no apology ' for claims that @entity9 would increase taxes on working families by more than £ 3,000 over the next five years – despite the @entity13 estimate being criticised by economists and dismissed as ' made up ' by @entity9			1
but mr @entity0 refused to say how he would deliver £ 12billion in savings from the welfare budget which he has claimed are needed to avoid tax rises			1
@entity0 this morning accused @entity9 of planning to ' pick you pocket ' if they are elected in may on the first full day of campaigning , the @entity6 said @entity9 was planning to hike taxes on businesses on families to reduce the deficit instead of making savings from government spending			1
it came as @entity9 risked a new clash with business by pledging to reverse the government 's cut in corporation tax just weeks after it is due to come into effect			2
shadow chancellor @entity34 said the move would enable them to throw a lifeline to smaller firms - cutting business rates on 1.5 million small firms - rather than the big companies which benefit from the reduction in corporation tax			0
but the @entity13 warned that it could lead to the loss of almost 100,000 jobs , putting economic security at risk , ' for the sake of making a political point '			0
mr @entity0 meanwhile promised that the @entity13 would help business create another two million jobs over the course of the next parliament if they are returned to @entity53			1
the @entity6 said the election was ' a choice about whether you want a government that will find savings and not pick your pocket or with @entity9 a government that will pick your pocket , i think , on a pretty frequent basis			1
' the @entity64 yesterday challenged mr @entity0 's claim of a £ 3,000 tax hike under @entity9 , saying the party 's plans did not suggest a rise of anything like that scale and that conservative plans implied a larger overall package of spending cuts or tax rises			1
@entity1 has accused the @entity76 of using ' made up figures ' asked about the £ 3,000 figure , the prime minister told the @entity80 : ' i think it 's a totally fair assumption			1
if @entity9 want to come forward now and change the assumptions and set out their own assumptions , then they can			2
' but in the meantime , the best calculation available is the one that we have made			0
' mr @entity0 was repeatedly pressed over @entity13 plans to save £ 12 billion from the welfare budget , as part of an overall £ 30 billion cuts package			1
asked whether he could rule out achieving some of the savings from cuts in disability benefits , he told the @entity80 that the coalition had just introduced a new @entity97 , adding : ' we have n't created that benefit in order to undermine it			0
we want to enhance it and safeguard it			0
' he added : ' politics is about choices and my choice - and i think the @entity110 people 's choice - is to find savings in welfare , rather than to put up people 's taxes			2
' meanwhile , mr @entity34 announced that the first budget of a @entity9 government will cut business rates for 1.5 million small companies – worth an average of £ 400 – to be followed by a freeze the following year			1
@entity9 say that 17 small firms would benefit from the cut for every one large business helped by the reduction in corporation tax – first announced in chancellor @entity127 's @entity126 – which takes effect next month			2
it argues the coalition spent £ 7 billion over the last parliament cutting the main rate of corporation tax to the benefit of larger firms while revenues from business rates rose by £ 3 billion , at an average cost to firms of £ 1,500 - a - year			0
mr @entity34 will say : ' unleashing the potential of smaller businesses to grow , create more good jobs and raise living standards is a vital part of @entity9 's better plan			2
' this is part of our plan to deliver a simpler and fairer tax system for small businesses			0
this is the right priority when money is tight			0
and it will mean that the tax burden on small businesses will be lower with @entity9 than under the @entity76			1
' @entity153 this morning demanded the @entity76 come clean over how they will cut £ 12billion from the welfare budget however the move risks re-opening the rift with some big business leaders who have strongly criticised @entity9 's spending plans			1
@entity13 treasury minister @entity159 said that abandoning the cut in corporation tax would jeopardise economic security			0
he said : ' this would be the first time corporation tax has risen in over 40 years and @entity9 's plans could cost 96,400 jobs - it would put people 's economic security at risk			2
' the @entity13 is helping businesses small and large as part of our long - term economic plan - we do n't divide them up for the sake of making a political point			0
' mr @entity0 told @entity178 's @entity177 that @entity9 's plan to raise corporation tax was ' a crazy thing to do when the economy is growing '			1
asked for details of how the @entity76 ' £ 12 billion benefit cuts would be delivered , mr @entity0 told @entity186 's @entity185 : ' effectively what we are saying is that we need to save £ 1 out of every £ 100 that the government spends in the next two years			1
we 've done that in the last five years			0
we need to do it for two more			0
' i think the right choice is to try to find that saving of £ 1 in every £ 100 , rather than putting up people 's taxes or adding to our borrowing			0
' where we 've identified savings , we 've been very clear about them			0
for instance , we 've said that we 'll cut the welfare cap - the amount of money that any family can get in welfare - from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000			0
' mr @entity0 said his party was setting out a ' very positive vision for @entity110 ' with a pledge to help business create two million new jobs , adding : ' i ca n't think of anything more positive than that			1

mr @entity0 said he ' made no apology ' for claims @entity9 would hike taxes
the @entity76 were criticised yesterday over claims taxes would rise £ 3,000
but the @entity6 refused to say how he would deliver the £ 12bn from welfare
