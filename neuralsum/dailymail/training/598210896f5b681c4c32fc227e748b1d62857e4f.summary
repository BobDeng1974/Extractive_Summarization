despite smartphones getting thinner and faster , they still fall foul of bad reception			2
but a new @entity5 case claims to solve the problem of signal dropping out , by up to doubling a device ’s signal strength			0
this is possible thanks to a thin gold antenna that is built into the plastic case to provide better coverage , faster data speed and longer battery life , the @entity18 company claims			1
no more black spots ! a new case by @entity5 claims to solve the frustrating problem of reception dropping out , by up to doubling a device ’s signal strength			2
it contains a gold antenna and is currently available for the @entity28 and @entity27 handsets the @entity28 case was unveiled at the @entity30 in @entity31 , where its makers claimed it ’s the first one that can optimise a smartphone ’s performance			1
‘ powered by patented antenna technology , @entity5 cases are the first performance - enhancing smartphone cases designed for speed , ’ said @entity36 , ceo of the @entity38 - based firm			0
‘ each case is embedded with a micro-thin , gold - plated antenna that works to increase your smartphone ’s signal strength so your phone can do more for you			2
’ a thin gold antenna is sandwiched between two layers of plastic , one with protective rubber cushioning ( pictured )			1
the metal shows through the outer plastic layer to make a pattern			0
the combined antenna system creates superior signal reception , which enables the device to work more efficiently , the company claims the antenna inside each case is engineered to automatically join together with an @entity28 's antennas , through a process called ‘ passive coupling ’			1
the idea is that this combined antenna system creates superior signal reception and transmission , which enables the device to work more efficiently			0
the case costs $ 60 ( £ 40 ) for an @entity28 and $ 70 ( £ 46 ) for an @entity71			1
more colours and cases for other models are planned to launch the multiplying effect is intended to work when the phone is held to the ear or in the hand , not when it is left lying on a surface			0
tests have shown that the case improves a phone ’s signal strength by an average of 1.6 times , doubling it at peak performance			0
but when @entity89 of @entity90 tested the case for a week in a variety of locations around @entity94 , he experienced mixed results			0
‘ roughly half the time it seemed to help , sometimes by a little and sometimes by a lot			0
and roughly half the time it made no difference at all , ’ he wrote			0
‘ on a few occasions , it actually degraded the performance of my @entity28 6			0
’ the company concedes that the case ’s performance depends on the phone , its carrier and location , but that consumers should see benefits including faster data speeds for web browsing and streaming music , for example , and wider coverage for less dropped calls			1
it also claims that because the smartphone does n’t have to work as hard to maintain signal , its battery will last longer			2
the case , which weighs 1.27 ounces ( 36g ) is made from thin plastic with a rubbery cushion around its edges and claims to offer protection against drops up to 6.6ft ( two metres )			2
cut - way sections expose the gold antenna which is sandwiched between the plastic layers			1
the case is currently only available for the @entity28 and @entity27 and costs $ 60 ( £ 40 ) and $ 70 ( £ 46 ) respectively			1
it comes in black , but more colours will be added this spring as well as cases for other handsets			0
when the @entity5 case , which contains a gold antenna , is snapped on , the phone and the case are instantly paired together to form a combined antenna system with improved signal strength			1
the case uses a common antenna engineering trick known as the ‘ aperture coupled patch ’ to transfer energy from the @entity28 ’s antenna to connect with the gold - plated antenna inside the case			1
the technique is indirect way of feeding the antenna in the case because there ’s no electrical connection			0
a ‘ hole ’ in the @entity5 antenna directs energy from the @entity28 into the antenna in the case , which is engineered to resonate at mobile phone frequencies , so the coupled energy is re-transmitted .			1

protective plastic case contains a thin gold antenna to *boost* reception
it connects with the phone automatically with no need for wires or apps
claims to provide better coverage , faster data speed and longer battery life
case is available for the @entity28 and @entity27 , from $ 60 ( £ 40 )
