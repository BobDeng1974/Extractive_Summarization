by @entity0 @entity2 's elite airborne force is to be cut by a third as the government slashes @entity6 jobs			2
as part of the coalition 's drive to reduce the @entity11 from 102,000 regulars to just 82,000 , the @entity7 will be stripped of half of its regular infantry battalions			1
the brigade , which is the @entity11 's rapid response airborne formation and encompasses the @entity18 battalions , will also lose air power , artillery and armoured vehicles			1
threat : @entity2 's elite airborne force @entity7 , pictured on an exercise in @entity25 in 2012 , is to be cut by a third as the government slashes @entity6 jobs march : soldiers from 16 @entity7 march toward the houses of @entity30 during a homecoming parade in 2011			1
the brigade has served in each of the @entity11 's recent deployments to @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 sources within the brigade - the largest in the @entity11 - estimate that it will have lost almost 3,000 of its 8,000 personnel by the end of december			1
the changes were first outlined in 2013 following the army 2020 study , which revealed how the government intended to make the @entity11 ' smaller , integrated and more adaptable '			2
it is hoped that the cuts will shave £ 10billion from the @entity49 budget , although there have been concerns over the reduction in numbers in the face of any potential future conflicts			0
details of the cuts to 16 @entity7 , and the timescale in which they will be implemented , have now emerged in an issue of the @entity18 ’s journal and in an internal briefing			1
by the end of the year infantry units the 1st and 2nd battalions the @entity62 will leave the brigade , which has served in each of the @entity11 's recent deployments to @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , for a lower readiness force , according to the @entity69			1
changes : by the end of the year infantry units the 1st and 2nd battalions the @entity62 will leave the brigade for a lower readiness force @entity74 the @entity73 , which had been part of the brigade , has been disbanded apart from a single public duties company			1
armoured reconnaissance vehicles from the @entity79 , where prince @entity80 is an officer , are also being reassigned and the brigade , based in @entity82 , @entity83 , is set to lose artillery , engineers and helicopters			1
former @entity18 officer and @entity89 mp , @entity88 , said the cuts were ' baffling '			1
' the drawdown in @entity37 means our focus now pivots towards contingency operations with 16 @entity7 set to play a lead role within that , ' he told the @entity69			1
' it ’s therefore baffling why , just at the point where we start to focus on contingency operations , cuts are being made that will undermine the deployability and combat effectiveness of the brigade			2
' as part of the army 2020 programme , it is hoped that the shortfall caused by the loss of 20,000 regulars will be made up by a newly renamed @entity112 , formerly the @entity113			2
questioning : former @entity18 officer and @entity89 mp , @entity88 , said the cuts were ' baffling ' the @entity115 will lose 5,500 sailors and the @entity117 is to be cut by 8,000			1
there have been four tranches of redundancies , although the most recent , announced in january is expected to be the final round			0
battalions earmarked to be disbanded in the july 2012 study are now in the process of winding up , and some have already been absorbed into other regiments			2
plans to disband the 2nd @entity128 was met with protests from former soldiers , who marched on parliament in an attempt to save the battalion - of which drummer @entity135 was a member			0
however , this summer the regiment 's 1st and 2nd battalions will merge to form the new @entity138 , with the second battalion removed from the @entity11 's order of battle on august 31			1
earlier this month @entity141 warned that the armed forces could face further cuts because of a £ 1.2million underspend by the @entity49 in december last year , general sir @entity145 , @entity146 , said there was a huge danger @entity2 would have too much state - of - the - art equipment but not enough troops to man it			0
in a damning assessment of government plans , he said : ' our current course leads to a strategically incoherent force structure - exquisite equipment , but insufficient resources to man that equipment or train			0
it is what the @entity161 call the spectre of the " hollow force "			0
' yesterday serving @entity115 vice admiral @entity165 launched a scathing attack on the state of the @entity115 , claiming it has been reduced to a collection of broken - down ships and ageing submarines whose crews are demoralised and poorly trained			0
writing in a military journal , he said : ‘ the price of unrelenting operational tempo is unsustainable pressure on engineers as every opportunity for maintenance is squeezed out of busy programmes			0
‘ for example , the lack of operators trained to stream and recover @entity184 towed sonar			0
‘ overall material readiness continues to decline			0
from the submarine perspective , the numbers of force elements at readiness have been driven low by late delivery of @entity192 [ a new model of submarine ] and platform ageing			0
‘ support is increasingly over-reliant on [ civilians ] for repair			0
this philosophy builds in declining competence and confidence			0
’ colonel @entity202 of @entity203 , part of @entity7 during the war in @entity36 , said : ' the @entity11 is now of a size where it ’s hard to call it an army			1
it ’s more of a defence force			0
' an @entity11 spokesman told @entity212 : ' difficult decisions were taken in the 2010 @entity214 to ensure we can properly equip the @entity11 for the future			2
' changes to the structure and size of @entity7 were announced in 2013 and implemented as part of wider changes that will ensure the @entity11 is more flexible and better able to meet future threats			1
' it will remain the @entity11 ’s premier high readiness formation and will be able to draw on support from other divisions and support units should this be required			2
' this is at the heart of creating a more adaptable force and will have no impact on our operational effectiveness			0
