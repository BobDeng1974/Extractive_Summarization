@entity0 was not the only @entity2 man to show off his goal scoring ability on international duty this week			1
over in @entity6 , @entity7 , 19 year old midfielder @entity5 scored a 36 - minute hat - trick in @entity7 under 21 ’s 4 - 3 victory over @entity10			1
@entity5 , who is currently out on loan in @entity12 , scored two goals with his left foot and one with his right			1
here , @entity16 takes a look at this versatile youngster			0
@entity5 , the @entity20 midfielder , right ? no ! that ’s @entity22			1
they are both from @entity7 but that is where the similarities pretty much end			1
@entity5 is a supremely skilful midfielder , who is composed in front of goal			1
@entity5 scored a 36 - minute hat - trick as @entity31 21s 4 - 3 so what should we call this whizz kid ? @entity5 , or @entity36 for short , that ’s what he seems to prefer			1
but do n’t get him confused with the other @entity5 , the author of the bestselling memoir boy , lost			1
i heard he was from @entity40 ? not quite			0
he ’s from the @entity7 city of @entity42 , known as ‘ little @entity40 , ’ because of its similarities to the @entity45 city			1
on the @entity48 coast , this once industrial city is now known for its textile industry			0
it has nine football teams but many of the 87,000 locals play ice hockey			0
in fact @entity55 , one of @entity7 ’s most famous ice hockey players hails from @entity42			2
so what did little @entity5 play ? his first love was football			2
he started his career at @entity62 ( or @entity63 for those who struggle with north @entity66 pronunciation )			0
there , he had to choose between football and ten - pin bowling			2
unfortunately for the @entity7 bowling league , he picked the beautiful game			2
@entity5 is also a brilliant table tennis player			2
when he was younger he reportedly beat @entity73 and the @entity75 keeper sulked off			0
@entity5 joined the @entity77 in 2011 , @entity76 had previously offered him a trial but he did n't turn up when was he first spotted by @entity80 clubs ? @entity76 invited him for a trial when he was 13 but @entity5 was a no - show			1
instead he moved to @entity83			0
he proved himself an excellent playmaker and subsequently attracted the attention of some of @entity88 ’s biggest clubs , including @entity89 and @entity90			0
in 2011 , he signed for @entity2 for £ 200,000 which is beginning to look like a bargain			1
is he part of the @entity94 bunch ? indeed			0
he is one of a number of good young @entity2 prospects who were scouted by club legend @entity94 who returned to @entity80 and persuaded @entity99 to sign up this @entity7 youngster			1
‘ when they said they wanted me it felt unreal , ’ said @entity5 , shortly after arriving in north @entity105 , ‘ i mean i played for a club in @entity7 , and such a big club wanted me so that was just unreal in the beginning			1
but after a while i was just happy and proud			0
’ @entity5 made 17 appearances for @entity2 's @entity112 side last season and one senior appearance does he stand out for anything other than his footballing ability ? oh yes			1
he has the same penchant for wacky hairstyles as his compatriot @entity119 ( back when he had hair )			0
still not out of his teens he has already mastered the @entity123 headband look , the @entity125 blond pineapple and the @entity126			0
and he claimed he might die his hair @entity119 red if he makes the @entity2 first team			2
he did in fact make his full debut for @entity2 in september 2013 as a substitute in a @entity134 game against @entity135			2
he scored a penalty in the decisive shoot out but the hair dye has n’t come out yet			2
so where is he now ? he made 17 appearances for @entity142 ’s last season but secured a loan move to @entity12 side @entity144 before the start of this season			0
he said he had become bored of playing in front of just 500 people			0
he might soon have a bigger audience .			0
