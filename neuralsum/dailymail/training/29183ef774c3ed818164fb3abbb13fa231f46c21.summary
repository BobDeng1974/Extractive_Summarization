many viewers were astonished to see the advert on national tv			1
writing on @entity55 , pensioner @entity54 said : ‘ s * * * , i ’ve just seen a @entity56 on @entity1			0
how can we possibly allow those nutters to advertise on tv			0
who next , @entity60 ? ’ @entity62 added : ‘ an advert for @entity22 in the @entity13 ad break			1
’ @entity66 said : ‘ @entity67 saw a @entity22 advert			2
luckily there was nothing on hand to throw at the telly at the time			0
’ some viewers have now set up a campaign on grassroots campaigning site @entity76 , demanding that the @entity16 stops the advert from being shown again			1
the petition , which currently has 30 supporters , states : ‘ it would be comical if its implications were n’t so potentially harmful			0
i hope most intelligent people that watch this advert will dismiss it as ludicrous			2
’ however , the director of @entity90 @entity89 @entity88 said that although she understands the concerns people have about the @entity22 advert , there is little that can be done to stop it			2
she said : ‘ there are n’t actually any rules saying you can or ca n’t advertise religion , which is how they have managed to get away with it			1
complaints accused @entity1 of allowing @entity22 - which has been branded a ' cult ' - of choosing @entity13 in order to target vulnerable people ' the only rules that mention religion are that you should n’t have adverts that are likely to offend somebody			1
‘ the problem is that the @entity16 are going according with their code and there ’s nothing in there saying you can or can not advertise religion			1
' if you say something that is patently untrue then they can do something but , a lot of the time , how can you say whether it is or is not ? i think it ’s really difficult			0
’ set up in 1952 by @entity126 science - fiction novelist @entity125 , @entity22 has become known for celebrity adherents such as @entity128 and @entity129			0
the religion , which is based around the idea that humans are ‘ immortal beings ’ who have forgotten their true nature , has been at the centre of a number of controversies			2
it has often been branded a cult although church leaders have repeatedly denied it brainwashes adherents			0
@entity22 has become famous for celebrity adherents including @entity129 , @entity145 , and @entity128 ( pictured ) in february , the @entity146 ruled that the @entity5 in @entity147 was a place of ‘ religious worship ’ and so could hold weddings			0
the @entity22 advert was vetted in march by @entity152 , the official body in charge of making sure adverts do not breach broadcasting codes before they are shown to the public			1
it is thought to have been shown a handful of times on @entity1 since then , with monday ’s screening the latest			2
a spokeswoman for the organisation said it was not the first @entity22 advert they have cleared for @entity89 broadcast in recent years , and insisted there was no reason to reject the @entity5 ’s application			2
similar @entity22 adverts have been screened on @entity1 over the past two years			0
the @entity16 said it received 24 complaints about the latest advert			1
it said some complained that as they considered @entity22 to be a cult and it could target vulnerable people			0
however , the body said it had decided the advert did not breach any of its codes			1
the spokesman said : ‘ we carefully considered the complaints but decided that there were n’t grounds for further action			0
' we understood that some viewers might consider the ad in poor taste because they disapproved of the practices and beliefs of the advertisers , or because they did not believe ads for religious organisa - tions should be broadcast on tv			0
‘ however , the @entity196 does not prohibit ads for religious organisations from being broadcast on channels			0
' the ad itself did not contain either explicit statements of belief or incitements for viewers to change their own beliefs , and only included the advertisers ’ website address , and so was unlikely to breach the @entity196 for these reasons			2
’ in february 2012 , the @entity16 banned a @entity211 group in @entity212 from claiming @entity213 can heal in its leaflets and on its website , arguing that it could encourage false hope			2
asked to justify the decision to show the advert , a spokesman for @entity1 simply reiterated that the advert had been cleared by @entity152			0
a spokesman for the @entity5 in the @entity89 said : ‘ there is always a buzz , both positive and negative , that occurs in social media whenever anything interesting happens in this world .			0

advert shown in the break between @entity23 and @entity13
attracted complaints alleging it was aimed at vulnerable viewers
but @entity16 says it does not breach their rules
there are no rules against advertising religion , only if advert is *offensive*
