@entity0 was still basking in the afterglow of @entity2 ’ famous @entity4 win over @entity5 in 2010 when sir @entity6 asked him a question			1
‘ he said to me in his strong @entity15 accent “ do you ken pressure ? ” , ’ recalled @entity0 of the upset at @entity9 , the only time @entity11 went out in the third round during his 27 years at the club			1
‘ i asked him what ken meant and he said , “ do you understand what pressure is ? ”			2
i told him as a manager i do			2
' " no , " he said			2
" pressure is to go and get promoted because i backed you at the start of the season ! " it was a nice little line from him and i remembered that when we were 1 - 0 down with 10 men on the last day of the season			1
’ @entity0 's @entity34 host @entity5 in the @entity4 fifth - round on monday at @entity35 @entity2 did win promotion from @entity37 to the @entity38 that year and @entity0 hopes history is about to repeat itself as he prepares for @entity11 ’s visit to @entity34 on monday night			1
@entity42 , the scorer of the only goal for @entity2 that day , has since joined @entity0 at @entity35 but is unlikely to play after suffering an ear infection			1
but the similarities are obvious for the 45 - year - old @entity34 boss			1
‘ i still do n’t have to buy a drink in @entity2 , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ hopefully it ’s an omen that we play @entity11 and then get promoted			2
‘ our players might never get another opportunity to play against @entity52 , @entity53 and the like			0
the one thing i ’ll say to them is to have no regrets			0
they need to wake up the morning after knowing they ’ve done themselves justice			0
’ veteran striker @entity57 has already promised to target @entity11 ’s soft centre and @entity0 believes @entity60 ’s side will have their hands full with his 14 - goal top - scorer @entity62			2
@entity0 on the touchline during his time at @entity2 with sir @entity6 in the @entity5 dugout he added : ‘ @entity52 probably earns more in a week than @entity62 earns in 18 months but he knows where the back of the net is			1
‘ he ’s our talisman			0
if the @entity11 players are n’t aware of him , i ’m sure they will be because he ruffles a few feathers			0
‘ they ’ve got everything to lose			0
if we play to our maximum and they have an off day , the magic of the @entity4 is there for everyone to see			1
’ @entity42 scored the goal in a famous 1 - 0 victory for @entity80 at @entity9 back in 2010 @entity42 celebrates his famous 2010 winner as @entity2 shocked @entity5 in the @entity4 @entity11 have still only lost once in 18 games			1
‘ there are certain things you look at where you think we can cause them problems , ’ says @entity0			0
‘ but you ’ve got to look at their front five or six and realise it ’s the best you can imagine in world football			0
‘ they do n’t seem to be gelling but what you find with those players is they can produce a bit of magic			0
‘ one of them can go past four players and smash one in from 35 yards			0
our players do n’t do that very often			0
’ this is the first game between the two clubs since they met in the @entity4 43 years ago and @entity11 won 2 - 0			1
@entity62 has scored 14 times this season , including a brace against @entity110 on tuesday			0
