this is the moment the wildlife became the photographer as a badger appeared to get behind the camera in a @entity6 garden			1
the yearling badger was captured on film inquisitively climbing on to the camera and posing as if it were about to take a photo of its own			2
the incredible images were all taken in a back garden in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the young badger cub climbed on the camera equipment and appeared to take a photo of its own talented amateur photographer @entity19 , 34 , took the pictures in the garden of his parents ' home			1
he said : ' the badgers have been coming to us for about five years or so now			0
we 've never tried to tame them but we do feed them occasionally			0
' i try to make sure they are still as wary of us as possible because it would n't be good for them to be too used to humans			0
' we have about five or six adults at the moment , after they had a batch of cubs last year			0
' at one point it looked as though the cub was fiddling with the camera settings as it climbed on the equipment mr @entity19 said he did have a favourite among the badgers - the aptly - named @entity44 , who is the matriarch of the group			1
he said : ' the badger behind the camera was a yearling , i had put peanut butter on the back of the camera with that picture but i was still thrilled when a badger finally got into position and looked as though it was fiddling with the settings			2
mr @entity19 also took some candid shots of the badgers exploring his parents ' garden , like this one showing three badgers climbing a tree ' because we live in a town we only get the badgers visiting after dark so you have to use some light source			1
i used to use flash and shoot by remote but now in most of the pictures i use a lamp and hand hold the camera			0
' even with that you are pushing the camera to the limit , what with the badgers being nocturnal , which means it can be frustrating especially with action shots			2
' the badgers have been visiting the @entity13 garden at night for several years			0

amateur photographer @entity19 , 34 , says the badgers are regular visitors to his parents ' back garden
mr @entity19 was ' thrilled ' when the cub climbed onto the equipment and *paused* , *allowing* him to take the candid images
