in the early hours of thursday morning , a stunned @entity0 woke to the news he had been nominated for an @entity2			1
@entity0 , a 28 - year - old @entity3 refugee , has won critical acclaim for his very first acting role , playing a @entity3 pirate in the movie @entity8 in which he stars opposite @entity11 a-lister @entity10			1
his success is all the most astonishing considering he was arrested and charged for drugs possession just over a year ago - and has been sentenced to jail time twice , @entity12 can today reveal			1
@entity0 was born in @entity16 and moved to @entity17 in @entity18 when he was 14 - and was working as a limousine driver and also part - time at his brother 's cellphone store before he won the career - making role in @entity25 's movie			1
the pair pose at the @entity43 on sunday night but , as @entity12 has learned , @entity0 has also been charged with a number of offenses ranging from card fraud to giving a police officer a fraudulent name			1
on august 18 , 2012 , @entity0 was arrested by @entity50 's @entity49 in @entity51 , along with four others after cops were called to a disturbance on mm 60 near @entity55			1
a police report from the time states : ' on arrival , two subjects were holding another subject down on the ground after he had allegedly ingested a plant leave material called ' khat ' and drank a partial bottle of liquid @entity64			0
' the combination of the two caused the subject to lose control of his faculties and attempt to jump out of a moving vehicle			0
' deputies during their investigation found suspected @entity73 in the vehicle as well as a plastic baggie containing the suspected ' @entity31 '			0
under his full name @entity0 , the actor and his friends were all charged with @entity78 and transported to the @entity79			1
cops were assisted at the scene by fire departments , @entity83 and the @entity84			2
the charge was later dismissed by @entity86			0
it was not the first time @entity0 had been in trouble with the law			2
on february 2 , 2004 , he was sentenced to 90 days in jail and given one year of probation for giving a police officer a false name of another person , and buying liquor aged under 21			2
he was also fined $ 1000			0
it is unclear how much time he actually served in prison - believed to be @entity99 in @entity18			2
the following year , on june 1 , 2005 , @entity0 was charged with financial transaction card fraud and sentenced to 200 days in jail and two years probation , alongside being given a $ 500 fine			1
it is also unclear how much time he served behind bars , also at @entity99			0
living it up : @entity0 , 28 , gets behind the wheel of a @entity109 in @entity11 it is all a far cry to where @entity0 now finds himself : hobnobbing with @entity11 's a list as awards season has started with a vengeance			2
he beat off stiff competition to win the role of real - life @entity3 pirate @entity41 , who led the 2009 @entity37 hijacking , an incident during which merchant mariner captain @entity34 was taken hostage by pirates in the @entity40			2
having won his role at an open casting call and barely realising his performance would be a hit , @entity0 even went back to working at his brother @entity127 's @entity129 shop in the @entity130 in @entity17 before the movie came out			1
he now plans to move to @entity132 to further his career next month and has taken on an acting agent			1
on sunday , @entity0 was nominated for best supporting actor at the @entity43 - losing out to fellow @entity2 hopeful @entity136 for @entity137 , but was the subject of jokes from hosts @entity140 and @entity142			1
@entity140 joked that ' @entity143 ' is ' who ’s invited to my room tonight - i ’m talking to you , @entity3 pirates			2
‘ i am the captain now ! ' , using his signature line from the movie			0
@entity142 added : ' before earning a @entity43 nomination for his first ever acting role in @entity8 , @entity0 was working as a limousine driver in @entity18			1
