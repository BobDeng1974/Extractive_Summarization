@entity1 and @entity2 are in a dead heat for the smartphone wars - but @entity2 has taken the lead in the lucrative @entity7 market , new figures have revealed			1
according to the latest research from @entity10 , global smartphone shipments grew 31 percent annually to reach a record 380 million units in the fourth quarter of 2014 - and @entity2 tied with @entity1 to become the world 's largest smartphone maker with sales of 74.5 million handsets			1
however , @entity1 revealed that overall its october - december profit sank , with an improvement in its semiconductor business insufficient to mask its mobile problems			1
@entity1 lost the battle of the big phones last quarter as @entity2 's large @entity23 lured buyers in the crucial @entity7 market			1
@entity2 tied with @entity1 to become the world 's largest smartphone vendor for the first time since @entity35			2
@entity1 shipped 74.5 million smartphones worldwide and captured 20 percent marketshare in @entity38 , dipping from 30 percent in @entity38			1
@entity39 , director at @entity10 , said , ' global smartphone shipments grew 31 percent annually from 290.2 million units in @entity38 to a record 380.1 million in @entity42			1
' an impressive 1.3 billion smartphones were shipped worldwide in 2014 , with very strong growth seen last year in emerging markets such as @entity7 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
' @entity48 , executive director at @entity10 , added , ' @entity2 shipped 74.5 million smartphones worldwide and captured a record 20 percent marketshare in @entity42 , increasing from 18 percent a year earlier			1
' @entity2 's new @entity51 and 6 @entity52 models are proving wildly popular in @entity7 , @entity53 and @entity54			2
' it was in @entity7 , the world 's largest market for smartphones , where @entity1 's dramatic decline was most evident			1
its weakness there is a key reason why @entity1 's share of global smartphone sales dropped to about one quarter last year from a one - third share in 2013			1
@entity2 contributed to @entity1 's latest reversal in fortune , launching iphones with bigger screens that robbed @entity1 's @entity72 phones of a key selling point			2
@entity1 was already battling competition in low - end phones from upstart manufacturers such as @entity7 's @entity77			1
@entity1 is struggling in countries such as @entity7 because ' they 're sort of being eaten from the bottom up by regional players ' including @entity82 and @entity77 , said @entity83 , an analyst at @entity85 research firm @entity84			1
' and now with @entity2 being competitive in larger phones , you 're seeing @entity1 losing any edge they had at the high end , ' he said			2
an advertisement poster shows @entity2 's @entity91 , top , and @entity1 ' @entity93 at a mobile phone shop in @entity27 , @entity95			2
in the second quarter last year , @entity77 overtook @entity1 to become the biggest selling smartphone maker in @entity7			1
@entity1 now ranks third in that market , after @entity2 raced to the top in the fourth quarter , according to research company @entity98			2
thanks to its bigger iphones , @entity2 sold a record 74.5 million @entity23 last quarter , which along with high prices helped make it the world 's most profitable company			2
according to @entity10 , @entity2 tied @entity1 in global smartphone sales , the first time @entity1 has not had a big lead since late 2011			1
the research firm said @entity2 's new iphones were ' wildly popular ' in @entity7 as well as the @entity53 and @entity54			0
@entity108 , another market research firm , put @entity2 narrowly ahead of @entity1			0
a third firm , @entity110 , estimated @entity2 came just short of a tie with @entity1			0
it 's not unusual for research firms to produce slightly different estimates			0
but @entity110 said @entity2 's sales were especially ' impressive ' because the new @entity23 models are selling at a higher average price than older models , at a time when @entity1 and other rivals are competing to offer phones at significantly lower prices			0
@entity2 shares gained 1.5 percent thursday and are up more than 7 percent since it announced @entity23 sales figures for the december quarter			0
@entity1 , in contrast , reported its fourth straight drop in quarterly earnings			0
profit sank 27 percent to 5.3 trillion won ( $ 4.9 billion )			1
@entity1 has not given a precise figure but estimated it sold between 72.2 million and 75.1 million smartphones			1
until september , @entity2 lacked one thing that @entity1 and other phone - makers had : a supersized smartphone screen			1
@entity2 's older @entity136 had a screen that measured 4 inches diagonally , while screens of 5 inches or larger have been the standard in @entity140 for more than a year			0
the new @entity23 6 measures 4.7 inches and the @entity52 is 5.5 inches			0
and that 's made a huge difference			0
banners advertising @entity1 ' @entity144 are displayed at a @entity1 shop in @entity27			0
meanwhile , @entity1 's flagship @entity148 smartphone was criticized for a cheap looking design			2
@entity1 replaced parts of the design with metallic features in subsequent models after the criticism			0
@entity10 , a market research firm , said @entity1 and @entity2 were tied each shipped 74.5 million smartphones in the final quarter , making it the first quarter since 2011 @entity1 's fourth quarter profit was a moderate improvement from the previous quarter 's 4.2 trillion won and higher than analysts ' forecasts of 4.4 trillion won , according to financial data provider @entity164			1
sales fell 11 percent from a year earlier to 52.7 trillion won while operating profit slumped 36 percent to 5.3 trillion won , in line with @entity1 's preview earlier this month			2
the company 's fourth - quarter net income beat forecasts mainly thanks to the solid performance of its component businesses , such as memory chips and display panels			0
the semiconductor division was a key cash cow generating about half of @entity1 's quarterly operating income			0
@entity1 did n't give clear guidance of how its mobile business would perform during the current quarter			0
instead , to appease investors the company announced a 40 percent increase in its annual dividends for 2014			0
its share price fell 1.3 percent in @entity27			0
repeating its previous statements , the company said it will try to differentiate its smartphones with new materials and designs and will reduce the number of smartphone models to streamline its business			0
