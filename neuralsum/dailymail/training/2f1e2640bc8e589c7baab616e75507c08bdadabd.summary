by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 20 november 2013 @entity2 : 21:00 est , 20 november 2013 the @entity3 has claimed the devastating typhoon that hit the @entity5 is a ‘ direct result ’ of climate change			1
@entity8 claimed at least 4,000 lives , while 4million people have been forced to leave their homes since the storm struck almost two weeks ago			1
during a speech at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity13 said : ‘ the devastating impact of @entity8 in the @entity5 should surely have been a poignant and telling reminder of the intimacy and interdependence of man ’s relationship with the natural world			1
warning : @entity13 was speaking today at a meeting on tropical forests and climate change , attended by business leaders and forestry experts , at the @entity15 in @entity16 sunset : a @entity8 survivor carries his belongings through the ruins of @entity33 , @entity5 , on his way back to his temporary shelter today			1
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced by the typhoon ‘ the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events has increased , and is set further to increase , in many parts of the world , as a direct result of anthropogenic climate change			1
’ @entity13 added that the ‘ facts and the science are clear and inescapable ’			1
the event , attended by business leaders and forestry experts , launched the annual report by the @entity50 – an international not - for - profit organisation – into corporate attempts to reduce the risk of supply chains causing deforestation			2
destruction : @entity8 survivors wait for their evacuation flight at the airport in @entity33 , @entity5 keeping on : people march in the rain in @entity33 , @entity5 , during a procession to call for courage and resilience among the @entity8 survivors			1
countless families lost loved ones to the typhoon @entity68 , chief executive of @entity50 , said : ‘ this is the first time we have had a joint event with prince @entity13			1
he is very knowledgeable about this area , probably more than any of the politicians in our government			2
’ @entity77 , director of corporate and social responsibility at @entity80 , said : ‘ prince @entity13 told me that 20 years ago he met our chief executive and challenged him to make our timber supply chain more sustainable			1
‘ i told prince @entity13 that we had met his challenge			2
‘ he said it was terrific that @entity80 are no longer causing deforestation , but asked what we are doing about reforestation			0
it is nice to be set a new challenge just when you have met the old one			0
’ devastation : a @entity5 @entity94 crew looks out from his helicopter as the @entity8 - ravaged city of @entity33 is seen in the background , during a flight to deliver relief goods in @entity101 province under an umbrella : prince @entity13 , arrives today at the launch of @entity50 's annual report into corporate attempts to reduce the risk of supply chains causing deforestation @entity110 , director of @entity13 ’s charities ’ @entity109 ( @entity109 ) praised the @entity3 ’s ‘ determination for practical action on the ground ’			1
@entity115 , co-chairman of the @entity109 ’s working group on public - private partnerships to reduce deforestation , said : ‘ it is vital that we do n’t make the same mistake in @entity121 in the next decade that we made in @entity122 in the last two			0
’ @entity124 , founder and director of the tropical forest think tank @entity127 , said : ‘ agriculture is the big sumo wrestler of deforestation and climate change			1
‘ we have to engage with the agricultural sector in stopping deforestation			0
’ but conservative mp @entity133 said prince @entity13 should ‘ have got his facts right ’ before speaking publicly about climate change			1
the mp for @entity137 and @entity138 said : ‘ for us to deduce that @entity8 was anything to do with global warming we would have to show that it ’s part of a trend towards more numerous or more powerful typhoons			2
‘ there has n’t been such a trend			0
even the @entity146 [ @entity146 ] has very low confidence there has been any trend in the number or intensity of typhoons			0
’ mr @entity133 added : ‘ i do n’t mind him wading in on issues but he should have got his facts right			0
’ a spokesman from the @entity155 said : ‘ we can not currently say whether @entity8 was or was not affected by climate change			1
‘ but scientific evidence shows that extreme weather events are most certainly intensifying and this is expected to continue as global warming proceeds			2
’ following @entity162 in 2012 , scientists warned that extreme weather events would increase if global warming continued at its current rate and these warnings have been echoed in @entity13 ’ address today			2
global warming is attributed to rising sea levels as the increase in temperatures causes the ice caps to melt			0
as sea levels rise , the chances of storm surges increase			0
a surge is an abnormal rise of water produced by a storm , caused by strong onshore winds and a drop in atmospheric pressure			0
these storms go hand - in - hand with tropical cyclones , hurricanes and typhoons			2
the rising levels also increase the chances of flooding associated with hurricanes and other extreme weather events			0
elsewhere , global warming is said to have increased the amount of rainfall across the globe because the rising temperatures increase the amount of moisture in the air			0
this is similarly associated with extreme weather events			0
as the @entity204 ’s temperature rises , the seas become warmer			0
@entity206 sea surface temperatures ( @entity207 ) have risen by 0.5 ° c over the past decade and this trend is set to continue			0
@entity211 expert @entity210 first suggested in the late 80s that an increase in @entity207 would cause stronger hurricanes and this threat is increased in areas where the sea temperatures are above 25 ° @entity217 however , the effect man - made climate change is having on global warming has not been categorically proved			1
although scientists do n’t deny global warming is causing the rise in extreme weather events , how much of this is down to man - made events is said to be ‘ inconclusive			2

death toll from @entity8 in @entity5 is now expected to exceed *10,000*
