it might seem like common sense that it ’s better to make important decisions after you ’ve eaten			2
but a study has claimed the exact opposite - that we actually make better decisions on an empty stomach			1
researchers found that people who were hungry made better snap decisions and could also appreciate future big rewards better than those who were fully fed. researchers at @entity13 in @entity14 say people make better decisions when they are hungry , including in activities such as gambling ( stock image shown )			1
in studies they found participants could better appreciate short and long rewards on an empty stomach the research was carried out by scientists at @entity13 in @entity14			1
in the study participants were asked to fast for a night , and when they arrived at the laboratory the next day some were given food and some were not			0
they were then given a variety of tasks to simulate decision making			0
in two of the three tasks participants took a psychological test known as the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , which is said to simulate real - life decision making			0
the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) is a psychological test to simulate real - life decision making			0
it is widely used in research of cognition and emotion			0
in the @entity35 participants are presented with four virtual decks of cards on a computer screen			0
depending on the card drawn , some will win game money , some will lose money and some also carry a penalty			0
some of the decks are ‘ bad decks ’ and some are ‘ good decks ’ , and it is down to the participant to work out which decks are best to selecting winning cards from			0
by testing a group of participants the test can be used to show how certain factors affect decision making			0
however , some critics of the @entity35 say it is not as accurate as thought			0
the first study involved 30 university students participating in the @entity35 in exchange for money , while the second was similar but involved 50 students			0
the results of these two studies indicated that people were better at making quick decisions while operating on an empty stomach in the third study , which involved 46 students , the participants were presented with 27 questions requiring them to choose between being given a small amount of money in the present or a larger amount of money in the future			1
in this study , the participants who had not eaten were more likely to choose the latter option , and vice-versa for those who had eaten			0
overall it was found that the participants who were hungry made more advantageous decisions in the task than those who had eaten			1
hungry people also had a better perception of future big rewards			2
this suggests that making decisions in a ‘ hot state ’ is actually beneficial			1
a ' hot state ' is what psychologists call the moment when high levels of emotion can cause you to make quickly and sometimes irrational decisions			1
the results challenge the thought that being hungry leads to rash decisions			1
this is known as a ' hot state ' , when emotions influence actions			1
the researchers say not eating ( stock image shown ) may actually allow us to make better decisions			2
and they also say quick decisions may not be as bad as thought ‘ these studies for the first time provide evidence that hot states improve decision making under uncertain conditions , challenging the conventional conception of the detrimental role of impulsivity in decision making , ’ the researchers write			1
they conclude that the pre-conceived notion that people make irrational decisions on an empty stomach is not necessarily true			1
‘ it may be that hot states in general , and hunger and appetite in particular , do not necessarily make people more impulsive but rather make them rely more on their gut feeling which benefits complex decisions with uncertain outcomes , ' they add			2
‘ alternatively , it may be that hot states do increase impulsivity but that impulsivity is not necessarily bad			2
