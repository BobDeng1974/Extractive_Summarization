@entity0 was left to rue a poor finish despite setting the clubhouse target in the first round of the @entity5 event in @entity6 on thursday			1
@entity0 played his first 12 holes in seven under par at @entity9 but dropped two shots in the last six to card an opening 67 in the second event of the @entity13 's @entity12			0
starting from the 10th , the @entity15 star birdied his opening hole and picked up further shots on the 13th , 14th , 16th and 17th to race to the turn in 31 , before birdies at the second and third took him well clear of a star - studded field featuring 40 of the world 's top 50			1
former @entity23 winner @entity0 set the clubhouse target in the first round of the @entity5 event in @entity6 but could have been further ahead but for a poor back nine @entity0 takes a ' selfie ' with three local fans as he competes in @entity6 ulsterman @entity0 talks to caddie @entity29 on the fifth hole and the @entity31 however , the former @entity23 champion dropped his first shot of the day on the fourth and paid the price for missing his only fairway of the round on the 603 - yard eighth hole , a par - five which had so far given up just two birdies			1
at five under par , @entity0 enjoyed a two - shot lead over @entity15 opponent @entity41 and fellow @entity43 @entity42 , who were approaching the end of their rounds , with @entity48 and @entity49 safely in the clubhouse on two under			1
@entity43 @entity51 claimed the title 12 months ago with a winning total of 24 under par , but @entity55 - who was fifth last year - had correctly predicted heavier rough and firmer greens would make scoring more difficult			0
@entity41 receives support from local fans as he tees off on the 15th hole in @entity6 @entity48 in action completed a two under round on the opening day of the event in @entity6 @entity49 watches his shot after teeing off on the fourth hole during the first round @entity67 , who was fourth in the @entity68 on sunday , was level par after 13 holes , while the winner at @entity74 - @entity73 's @entity72 - was one over with three to play			2
@entity76 's @entity75 , who took 13 on the ninth hole during his final round last week , struggled to an opening 78 , while @entity81 winner @entity80 managed just one birdie in a round of 80			0
@entity41 and @entity42 duly completed rounds of 69 and were soon joined on three under by the likes of @entity86 , @entity87 , 2011 winner @entity88 and @entity90 's @entity89			2
@entity91 looked set to expand that group still further but twice found sand on the ninth - his final hole - and almost thinned his third shot across the green and into the water			0
the resulting bogey left @entity91 alongside @entity48 and @entity49 on two under , with world number two @entity99 also completing an opening round of 70 .			0
