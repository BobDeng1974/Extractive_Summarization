some of the @entity1 ’s leading stars will have to juggle their religious and footballing commitments with the holy month of ramadan set to begin during the finals			1
it will be the first time since 1986 that the @entity7 period of worship has fallen during the @entity9 fast from dawn until dusk during @entity12 and are supposed to refrain from all food and drink - and that could affect scores of players on show in @entity18 this summer			1
@entity12 begins on june 28 – the first day of @entity19 matches - and runs until july 27			1
were the likes of @entity22 and @entity23 to make the last 16 then several of their players would have to manage their religious duties			2
brothers in arms : @entity23 duo @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 are followers of @entity7 faith : @entity34 's @entity33 is one of @entity22 's high - profile @entity36 stars belief : @entity40 forward @entity39 is another @entity41 star of @entity36 faith @entity22 stars including @entity34 ’s @entity33 , @entity44 of @entity45 , @entity47 defender @entity46 and @entity49 ’s @entity48 are all practising @entity36			1
meanwhile , @entity23 brothers @entity29 and @entity30 – of @entity51 and @entity45 respectively – former @entity47 striker @entity52 and @entity49 midfielder @entity53 are also @entity36			1
the majority of the @entity56 squad – including @entity51 frontman @entity57 – are followers of @entity7 , as are @entity60 ’s @entity59 duo @entity58 and @entity61 , @entity40 ’s key man @entity39 and @entity47 and @entity63 playmaker @entity62			1
one piece of good news for those players is that there are currently just 11 hours of daylight in @entity69 , compared to nearly 17 in the @entity70			1
some @entity36 players have sought permission to eat and drink during @entity12 but some , such as @entity30 , are intent on sticking to the practice of fasting			1
top man : @entity63 's @entity62 will be one of his country 's key players faith : @entity57 is one of many @entity82 squad members who are followers of @entity7 belief : @entity30 ( centre ) says @entity12 can actually make players stronger speaking last year , @entity30 explained : ‘ you definitely need discipline			1
for me , the first five days are difficult but after that , the body just starts to [ adapt ] and you feel really happy			2
‘ you clean your body as well and you feel even stronger after @entity12			0
i think it ’s amazing how @entity12 can make you really strong			0
‘ i ’ve been observing @entity12 during all the years i ’ve been in football			0
it ’s very important that you eat well			0
it ’s important that you eat the right food because you can gain weight or you can have less food in your body			0
‘ that ’s why you need to drink very well			0
you also need to be aware of what you are doing , because your body is missing things			0
with the doctor and all the people in the club , we try to work on that			0
they give me things that i can take to help me feel better			0
’ why does @entity12 not always fall during the @entity1 ? @entity12 is a lunar month , it begins about 11 days earlier each year			2
during a @entity36 's life , @entity12 will fall both during winter months , when the days are short , and summer months , when the days are long and the fast is more difficult			1
why do @entity36 fast during @entity12 ? the practice is intended to help teach @entity36 ‘ self - discipline , self - restraint and generosity ’			1
it is common to have one meal ( known as the suhoor ) , just before sunrise and another ( known as the iftar ) , directly after sunset			0
during the hours of daylight they are not allowed to consume any food or drink			2
smoking and having sex are also forbidden			0
who is exempt from fasting ? young children , the sick or those with mental illnesses , the elderly and women who are menstruating , pregnant , breast - feeding or have recently had a baby			0
do employers make concessions during @entity12 ? some @entity70 companies allow @entity36 to begin their working day later so they can catch up on sleep after waking at 3am to eat			1
when does it end ? @entity12 ends this year on the evening of july 27			0
every @entity12 culminates with the festival of @entity142 , which takes place either 29 or 30 days after the beginning of the month			2
