by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 18:04 est , 30 august 2013 there are historical allies and there are strong allies , and @entity5 may have confused the two yesterday when he hailed @entity6 as @entity8 ’s oldest friend			1
it was supposed to be a calculated snub to @entity11 , of course			0
with a few exceptions , in the past 100 years it ’s become a rule of thumb that @entity8 no longer goes to war without @entity11 at its side			2
@entity18 : secretary of state @entity5 was mocked for his @entity18 during the 2004 presidential race			0
yesterday he called them @entity8 's ' oldest ally ' as he hailed the government for supporting @entity24 strikes so the @entity11 ’s failure to follow the @entity8 into action over @entity24 inevitably stung in @entity27 , prompting mr @entity5 to cosy up to @entity6			1
but in reality @entity8 tend to mistrust the @entity6 even more than the @entity11 do			1
famously , @entity8 refer to them as ‘ cheese - eating surrender monkeys ’			2
and @entity6 - speaking mr @entity5 was mocked for his @entity18 during the 2004 presidential race			0
the relationship had started well			0
@entity6 troops and ships under the @entity34 provided crucial help during @entity8 ’s war of independence from @entity11			1
links were strengthened by founding father @entity39 , who lived in @entity40 as @entity8 ambassador			0
a good start : @entity6 forces helped @entity8 secede from @entity11 and founding father @entity39 ( pictured ) lived for a while in @entity40 ... but the friendship crumpled when @entity46 took power and resented @entity8 ’s treaty - making with @entity11			1
by 1798 a state of undeclared war existed between the two former allies			0
in the 1840s , @entity6 supported @entity54 ’s moves for independence from the @entity8 and blocked @entity8 moves to gain control of @entity58			1
the situation became even worse during the @entity60			0
while @entity6 was technically neutral , @entity46 favoured the @entity61			0
it managed to antagonise the @entity8 further by installing the @entity64 archduke @entity63 on the throne of @entity66			0
@entity8 , which wanted @entity6 troops out of @entity66 , refused to recognise the government			1
in the 20th century @entity6 and the @entity8 got on a little better , but relations were strained between @entity70 and @entity71 during the @entity72			1
@entity71 and his @entity73 refused to take part in the @entity75 but the @entity76 still generously allowed @entity6 troops to be the first to liberate @entity40			0
after @entity71 became president , he clashed with the @entity8 over @entity6 ’s decision to build its own nuclear weapons			1
... but @entity46 , left , resented @entity8 's treaty - making with @entity11 in the 18th century , while in the 20th , president @entity71 , right , clashed with the @entity8 over nuclear weapons and took his country out of @entity85 in 1966 , @entity6 pulled its forces out of @entity85 and kicked the @entity8 - led organisation out of its hq at @entity89			2
@entity6 earned its ‘ surrender monkey ’ moniker during the 2003 @entity8 invasion of @entity93			2
the @entity6 opposed a @entity95 resolution authorising the invasion and , in retaliation , @entity98 feeling swept across the @entity8 with public campaigns to boycott @entity6 goods .			2

history of @entity6 relations with @entity8 hardly one of *unwavering* support
