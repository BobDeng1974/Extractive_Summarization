by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 08:08 est , 9 march 2012 when @entity2 heard his beloved springer spaniel @entity4 had been found after more than five years , he thought it was nothing more than a shaggy dog story			1
but the call he had been waiting so desperately for was true			0
now the pair have been reunited after the missing dog was discovered wandering the streets 40 miles from home			1
and @entity4 immediately showed that she recognised her owner by wagging her tail			1
reunited : @entity4 the @entity16 springer spaniel is back at home with owner @entity2 five years after she went missing mr @entity2 , 62 , and his wife @entity18 , 60 , feared the worst after @entity4 and her brother @entity20 ran off while going for a walk in a park in 2007			1
they found @entity20 nearby but there was no trace of @entity4 - until she was seen foraging for scraps on a street in @entity28 , @entity29 , two weeks ago			1
@entity4 had been micro-chipped in case she got lost which meant her owners , from @entity33 , @entity34 , could be traced			1
mr @entity2 , a retired plumber , said : ' we were over the moon when we got the phone call			2
' we were on the way home and got a mobile call from a couple in @entity28 who had found @entity4 wandering with another dog			1
' we were wondering if it was a hoax at first but when we got back home there was a message from the dog warden			2
' after the couple phoned him , he had checked @entity4 ’s microchip and got in touch with us			2
' we phoned the kennels where she had been taken and arranged to collect her the next day			0
' @entity18 could n’t stop crying , she was astonished			0
' @entity4 is already settling in at home and preparing herself for more adventures with @entity20			1
mr @entity2 said : ' when @entity4 was back , she was really obedient and really friendly and she got on with @entity20 as if nothing had happened			1
roaming : @entity4 was found wandering with another dog in @entity28 , @entity29 - 40 miles from where she went missing ' after a couple of days they were inseparable again			1
it was like she had never been away			0
' the couple , who have been married for almost 23 years , gave up hope of finding @entity4 after she vanished during a walk in april 2007			2
@entity4 was only a year old then and , because she and @entity20 could be lively , the @entity64 would put one of them on a lead and let the other run free for a while			2
mr @entity2 said : ' on that particular day i had @entity20 on the lead and @entity4 off , but @entity20 managed to back out of his collar			1
' the both of them just looked at each other as if they were telepathic and did a bee - line for the exit of the park			0
' a couple of hours later we found @entity20 but @entity4 was nowhere to be seen			2
' every time someone rang with a sighting of her we would go off in the car and look but there was never any sign of her , until the phone call			0
' best behaviour : @entity4 , right , has been more obedient since her return and gets on with her brother @entity20 , left , as if nothing happened mr @entity2 said it was an ' amazing feeling ' to have @entity4 back			1
' she had certainly not been living wild for five years , somebody had been looking after her , ' he added			0
' i think she was picked up by somebody shortly after she went missing			0
she is a very pretty dog			0
cosy : @entity4 and @entity20 were inseparable as puppies , as these pictures , taken before the ran away from their owners , show ' whether she was sold on or kept , and then ran off again , i do n’t know			1
' she is very lively so she could have been working on a farm			0
' i ca n’t see how she could get to @entity28 by her own power			0
' how did she get there ? @entity4 was found in @entity28 , @entity29 , which is 40 miles from her owners ' house in @entity34 mr and mrs @entity107 run company @entity109 , which cares for pets while their owners are on holiday			1
mrs @entity113 , a retired nurse with two children from a previous relationship , said they ' searched everywhere ' after @entity4 went missing			2
' we made up posters , did a door - to - door hunt , went online and even asked the local radio station to ask if anyone had seen her , ' she said			0
' we thought we would never see her again and just hoped that someone kind had got her and was looking after her			0
' it was a very emotional reunion			0
we took her home feeling as if we had won the lottery			2
' we have no real idea about her life up to the time she was found			0
' mrs @entity107 said @entity4 was ' truly part of the family once more '			1
' @entity20 realised that the boss was back but , despite a few moments early on , they get on well now			0
