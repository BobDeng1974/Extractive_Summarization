the fashion world might be obsessed with youth but it seems no one has told 75 - year - old @entity3 , who has a trendy @entity5 haircut and loves @entity6			1
or @entity7 , who , at 85 , is the world 's oldest model - and one of the most stylish , with a wardrobe cool enough to leave the likes of @entity13 looking on in envy			1
or @entity15 , who says she will wear mini-skirts at 87 if she wants , adding that her legs are her ' best asset '			1
and they are not alone , as new @entity21 documentary , fabulous fashionistas , reveals			1
the film follows six spectacularly well - dressed pensioners - none of whom is letting age get in the way of looking stylish			1
glamorous granny : @entity3 , 75 , reinvented herself as a fashionista after being widowed at 70 rock n ' roll gran : @entity3 , who lives in @entity32 , says she had always been passionate about fashion teenage kicks : @entity3 says her style inspiration comes from local youngsters - hence her love of @entity6 boots fashion rebel : @entity3 says that she wears whatever she fancies and has no intention of toning things down one of the most adventurous is @entity43 , 73 , who has turned dressing into an art form - quite literally			1
an artist by trade , she frequently designs her own clothes , which she describes as a release ' from the tyranny of fashion '			1
with her bold red frames , chunky bangles and penchant for black , she bears a striking resemblance to the fashion world 's grandmother - in - chief , @entity57 , another 70 - something still making her mark on the fashion world			2
then there 's @entity62 , @entity62 , 91 , a @entity64 peer who has made a point of refusing to go quietly into the fashion night and can regularly be spotted intently , but stylishly , listening to debates from the comfort of the @entity71 ' iconic red benches			1
' she snuck in under the wire but i could n’t resist because she is such a character , ' says @entity75 , the director behind the documentary			2
' she is terrifically well put - together and she shops from catalogues			2
actually she has a bit of an addiction to them			2
' advanced style : @entity83 , 75 , ( left ) gets her clothes in charity shops while @entity7 , 85 , is a model fashionable : @entity62 , @entity62 is 91 and stylish while @entity43 , 73 is a fashion rebel fabulous : ( left to right ) @entity43 , @entity7 and @entity62 , @entity62 age - defying : @entity15 , 87 , started working life as a dancer in the 1940s for @entity83 , 75 , it is not catalogues but charity shops that fuel her passion for fashion			1
despite subsisting on a pension of just £ 100 a week , she cuts a striking figure in her crimson turban and chunky jewels			2
on her shopping list are flowing dresses vibrant scarlet and black , which she combines with eye - catching costume jewellery , uber - glamorous hats and her most recent purchase , a £ 4 pair of @entity108 boots			2
' style , as one gets older , is more noticeable , ' she explains			2
' how i look is to do with my identity and the fun of it			2
it ’s nothing to do with looking younger			2
' it might not be about looking younger , but you 'd never know it when looking at @entity15 , 87			2
a former ballerina , @entity15 , who looks at least 20 years younger than she really is , exercises every day and still wears both mini-skirts and leggings			0
' you just must n’t allow the ageing process in , ' she reveals			0
her other secret for eternal youth is that she is married to a man 27 years younger than her			0
' my friends thought it was positively indecent when we started to see each other , but since we are still together now , how silly they look now ! ' her main gripe with women ' giving up ' at a certain age is that they let their posture go			0
' you see them hunched over , looking downward			0
my training as a dancer always taught me that you stand up straight and get those shoulders back			0
' to be crude about it , the nipples should lead – and how can they do that if they are pointing down towards the floor somewhere			0
' looking good : @entity3 , @entity15 and @entity83 show how to pose like you mean it she has no issues about wearing short skirts			1
' i know people probably look at the face and go " oh dear " but my legs have always been my best asset			0
why should i stop showing them off			0
' it 's a philosophy with which @entity3 can identify , although she admits that after a knee operation , mini-skirts are not for her anymore			1
' oh no. i do n’t really go above the knee with a skirt			0
once you do that , at my age , you have to start thinking about the scars from my knee replacement op. ' resplendent in her favourite scarlet t - shirt and grey - checked skirt , she 's got hair that owes more than a little to @entity171 - and the attitude to match			0
widowed at 70 , she filled the hole left by her husband with a job at @entity176 before taking herself - and her considerable styling skills - off to work at a boutique in @entity32			0
' i 'm leading a different life , ' adds @entity3 , who also runs three times a week , despite having had her knee replaced			1
' it 's more adventurous			0
' fabulous fashionistas , tuesday 17th september , 10pm , @entity21 with her sharply cut fringe and penchant for @entity108 boots , @entity3 is no one 's idea of a frail old grandmother - and the glamorous septuagenarian says she has absolutely no intention of changing			1
' i have always been interested in fashion , but more so as i have got older , ' explains @entity3			1
' i like to dress as i want to dress			0
when i put something on , i do n't think " will anybody think i look good ? " ' i just decide in my own mind whether i look good - i do n't really care about other people			0
' @entity3 became @entity176 's oldest employee six years ago and has gone on to work at many of the big high street names , including current employer @entity200 she says young people are impressed with her look and do n't have any issues with her buying similar clothes to them			1
cool : @entity3 says that teenagers love her look , although other pensioners can be scared to try trendy clothes high street : @entity3 became @entity176 's oldest employee six years ago but now works for another boutique @entity3 hopes her tv appearance will help to persuade older people than life does n't stop the day you pick up your pension			1
' if it shows older people that life is there for the grabbing and that you have to take that plunge , then i will be happy , ' adds @entity3			1
' i do n't think youngsters think about it in the same way			0
when i go into @entity228 , they are used to seeing me now and just accept that i am buying their clothes			0
' one of @entity3 's two sons , @entity232 , 49 , said the whole family supports her fashion - savvy style			1
he said @entity3 's grandchildren , who are all in their teens , regularly ask their grandmother for tips on how to look cool			1
@entity232 said : ' she has always dressed like that , so to us it does n't look any different			0
the kids accept the way she looks as normal , but when their friends come round they say " i wish my gran could dress like that "			0
' we all know that the way she dresses , and her personality , means she stands out			0
