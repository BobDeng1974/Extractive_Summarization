@entity0 and the @entity2 fans are partly to blame for @entity4 ’s latest bite			1
by throwing his arms around @entity4 last summer , @entity0 got the best out of the player , but he also fed his ego			1
the fans forgot the @entity11 bite , they swept away memories of @entity4 openly saying he wanted to leave @entity2 , and they chose to ignore the fact that @entity4 downed tools on his return to @entity16 after the @entity17			1
@entity4 was allowed to get away with lots of bad stuff , and was treated as a legend , simply because he scored lots of goals			1
video scroll for @entity4 returning home from the @entity25 and @entity0 on previous ban sinking in : @entity4 bites @entity28 defender @entity27 during their @entity30 clash grounded : the @entity32 striker reacts by holding his teeth after biting @entity27 in @entity34 evidence : @entity28 defender @entity27 shows the damage that @entity4 's bite caused just a quick check back through the history books confirms that you have to do a little bit more than finish second to be a @entity2 legend			1
and it may be the lack of title success in the modern era that has lowered standards at @entity50 , but those fans should ask more of their players on and off the pitch			0
the irony is that the points dropped in the games @entity4 missed because of suspension at the start of last season cost @entity2 the title			1
that ban came back to bite @entity2 on the shoulder			2
the season of adulation @entity4 enjoyed gave him @entity66 - like status in his own mind coming into the @entity25			0
the crisis when he was injured fed the ego even more , and the desperation to have him back after @entity32 lost to @entity71 gave @entity4 a head the size of @entity74			2
end of the road : @entity4 returned home after being banned from football for four months ovation : @entity4 returned home to a hero 's welcome despite his ban for biting the @entity84 defender previous : @entity4 was banned for biting @entity11 during @entity2 's game against @entity86 at @entity50 two goals and a victory later , @entity4 was the self - appointed @entity89			1
he taunted the @entity90 and punished us all - in his world			0
and then , just when it looked like @entity32 were going out of the tournament , frustration set in and @entity4 ’s ' @entity66 status ' was threatened			0
he lashed out , he regressed to childhood and bit an opponent			0
what would @entity99 have said about that bite ? well he probably would n’t have said anything because i suspect he would have sent @entity4 packing after the bite on @entity11 last year , described by @entity0 as an ' unfortunate incident			2
' seeing is believing : @entity4 was named @entity108 after his form helped @entity2 to second place regular : the @entity111 scored 31 @entity113 goals last season and nearly guided @entity2 to the title faith : @entity0 made @entity2 captain at @entity118 , a game they won 5 - 0 video @entity4 family say he should leave @entity2 when it comes to finding the right words , there are few from the footballing world who get close to matching the articulation of @entity99 the great , so @entity0 has a tough act to follow			2
the @entity2 boss has shown admirable deference to @entity99 , and made attempts to follow his lead			0
the short - termism shown by @entity0 in his treatment of @entity4 has taken @entity2 back into the @entity134 , but it ’s also damaged the reputation of this special club			1
@entity99 would n’t have stood for that			0
the great man once tore into @entity139 for wearing a bandage at training , so you can only imagine what he would have thought of a @entity2 player biting an opponent			0
back in december , @entity0 made @entity4 captain of @entity2 for their @entity113 game at @entity118			2
the manager explained the decision by saying he wanted : ' … someone who could represent me and the club			0
' spat : @entity4 was also banned for racially abusing @entity155 's @entity154 in october 2011 shake on it ? @entity4 and @entity154 did n't shake hands at a @entity113 meeting at @entity159 in 2012 stand by your man : @entity4 was brought to @entity50 by @entity2 legend @entity162 that is surely no longer the case			1
remember when @entity4 made @entity162 look a fool over the @entity154 handshake ? if a player thinks it ’s acceptable to do that to a legend like @entity162 , he ’s not fit to represent the club			1
@entity2 fans have forgiven @entity4 too many times			2
they should now sell him , and trust their manager to spend the money wisely			0
@entity175 has always held its head up high			0
but you can only hang that head in shame when one of your players has a habit of biting opponents			0
time to let @entity4 walk on through his storm , and not damage the great name of @entity2 anymore .			1

@entity4 was treated like a legend despite his previous incidents
@entity2 fed @entity4 's ego by forgetting the striker 's *troubled* past
striker involved in racism storm with @entity154 and bit @entity11
@entity2 need to sell him and *protect* the club 's name from further damage
