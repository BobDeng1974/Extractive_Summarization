@entity0 has once again defended former @entity2 team - mate @entity1 following his spitting incident with @entity5 's @entity4			1
the former @entity7 midfielder believes @entity1 spat towards the floor in a ' reflex action ' after the @entity11 striker kicked out at him during wednesday night 's match at @entity13			1
both players have been charged with spitting by the @entity16 accepted the charge and will serve a seven - match ban , while @entity1 has until 6pm on friday to respond			1
@entity1 appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored @entity5 striker @entity1 's former @entity2 team - mate @entity0 has defended the player @entity0 also defended @entity1 will working as a pundit on the match for @entity25 on wednesday having leapt to the defence of @entity1 while working as a pundit during @entity25 's coverage of the match , @entity0 has again backed the @entity31 defender			1
@entity0 writes in his @entity33 column : ' i have watched the footage of @entity1 and @entity4 's spitting incident and i come to the same conclusion that was my instinct the first time i saw the replay : i do n't think @entity1 ever intended to spit at @entity16			1
' as @entity1 gets up and takes a step backwards , he spits			2
at the time his eyes are fixed on @entity4 ... and that is what makes it look bad			2
but my instinct is that @entity1 is spitting to the floor			1
' it is a reflex			0
footballers , athletes in all sorts of sports , have a tendency to spit in the periods of respite after action			0
you can do it without even thinking			0
' i know that i did , as a player			0
on this occasion , i believes it was a reflex action from @entity1			1
not one aimed at @entity4			2
' @entity1 could face a ban of six matches if found guilty by the @entity16			2
@entity4 subsequently retaliates , and appears to aim spit of his own back at the @entity2 man @entity1 ( left ) and @entity4 clash near the half - way line at @entity13 following the unpleasant exchange @entity67 ( a ) , march 15 @entity68 ( h ) , march 21 @entity70 ( a ) , april 5 @entity71 ( a ) , april 13 @entity72 ( h ) , april 19 @entity74 ( h ) , april 25 @entity76 ( a ) , may 2 both @entity4 and @entity1 released statements on thursday in which they disagreed on the intent behind the disgusting scenes			1
bizarrely , @entity1 claimed he was shocked by the allegations and protested his innocence			2
@entity4 responded by apologising but said he was provoked when @entity1 spat at him			1
indeed , @entity83 understands that @entity4 is furious that the @entity31 international has not admitted his guilt , and is adamant the defender spat at his leg			2
and @entity4 will inform @entity16 disciplinary chiefs that @entity1 intentionally spat at him when questioned about the incident			1
@entity4 has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the @entity16 on thursday this season , @entity16 guidelines dictate that the punishment for spitting should be in line with @entity98 's six game ban for the offence			1
@entity4 faces an additional one game ban because he has already been sent off for violent conduct after elbowing @entity67 's @entity102 ( above ) in december			2
having conceded he was wrong to react by spitting in @entity1 ’s face , @entity4 will be fined a week ’s wages of around £ 40,000 by @entity5 , who will now be without their 11 - goal top scorer until may			1
@entity16 rules were changed in the summer to bring them in line with @entity98 guidelines which state a player found guilty of spitting at an opponent will be suspended for six games			0
however , @entity4 has already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing @entity67 ’s @entity102 and as a result will be hit with an additional one - game suspension			1
he will not return until the final three matches of the campaign			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , could miss crucial @entity122 fixtures against @entity72 , @entity71 , @entity123 and @entity124 should he be found guilty			1
but the 27 - year - old will contest the charge , to which he must respond by 6pm on friday evening			1
the @entity129 striker points the finger at @entity2 defender @entity1 after the ugly incident @entity5 managing director @entity132 said : ' both ourselves and @entity4 agree that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable			1
' in life , when you do something wrong you have to front up , admit your mistakes and accept the punishment			0
@entity4 was proactive this morning in making a full and heartfelt apology , which he did in advance of any notification from the @entity16 regarding this charge			2
' this was something he felt strongly about and we fully support him in quickly accepting the charge			0
' @entity4 is known to many of our region 's schools , community groups and junior football teams for his involvement in the work of the @entity155			0
' he has this evening expressed to us his strong desire to engage in additional community activities during the period of his ban			0
' he is particularly keen to use his position as a role model to encourage young and influential fans to engage in sport and learn lessons about the importance of fair play and personal conduct			0
' @entity1 ’s statement read : ‘ having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night ’s match			1
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at @entity4			0
‘ i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor			1
‘ during the game @entity4 and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting			1
‘ it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do			0
it is certainly not something that i did last night			0
’ tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from @entity5 and @entity2 gather on the pitch @entity4 was banned for an extra man after @entity197 sent off for elbowing @entity67 's @entity102 in december the @entity16 were waiting for referee @entity199 's report			1
as he missed the incident between @entity1 and @entity201 , and it was n't included in his report - the @entity16 were within their right to retrospectively punish the pair			2
@entity207 striker @entity206 was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at @entity123 goalkeeper @entity210			0
however , the @entity16 have issued new guidelines to move in line with new @entity98 guidelines meaning @entity1 and @entity4 could now be banned for six games			2
@entity4 responded less than an hour later by saying : ‘ i have apologies to make to a lot of people today			0
firstly to my team - mates and to our supporters , secondly to @entity1 , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and @entity1			2
‘ i reacted to something i found very unpleasant			0
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment			0
i have always tried hard to be a positive role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down			0
‘ i hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry			0
perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake , not copy it			0
