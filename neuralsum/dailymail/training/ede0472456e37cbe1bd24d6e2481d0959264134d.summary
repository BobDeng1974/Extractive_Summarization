by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:19 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:19 est , 20 december 2013 @entity4 fighter jets have been involved in near misses in the skies once every two weeks since the @entity7 approved - but never fitted - a safety measure 15 years ago			2
defence chiefs pledged to implement a collision avoidance system for @entity11 in the 1998 @entity12			1
the warning system could have prevented the mid-air smash between two @entity4 jets that killed three airmen last year			1
mid-air : new figures revealed the shocking number of times @entity22 jets like the one pictured have almost collided near miss : tornado fighter jets , such as the one shown here , come close to crashing every other week , new figures show but ministers controversially delayed introducing the £ 55million device in a bid to save cash			1
it will finally be fitted in the fighter - bombers in late - 2014			0
new figures uncovered by @entity34 mp @entity33 have revealed that since the @entity7 first promised the safety measure there have been two collisions and 361 near misses involving the @entity39			1
critics said the extraordinary total - around 22 a year between 1998 and 2013 - exposed the seriousness of the situation and suggested defence chiefs were ' not putting safety first '			1
mr @entity33 , who represents @entity46 , said : ' it is very shocking that there have been so many incidents since the @entity7 promised to install a collision warning system on the aircraft which according to them would " improve safety for man and machine "			1
' it shows that the conditions that led to incidents like the tragic collision in 2012 are not isolated and rare			2
‘ we do n't know whether such a system would definitely have stopped that collision and saved lives , but this is certainly being considered in connection with a potential fatal accident inquiry			1
' i believe that the families of the victims deserve the fullest answers and the whole truth			0
the @entity7 has a lot of questions to answer about why they do not appear to put the safety of service personnel first			0
' killed : flight lieutenant @entity77 , pictured , was one of the men killed in the 2012 crash tragic : flight lieutenant @entity80 , left , and squadron leader @entity81 , right , also died in the crash retired @entity4 engineer and airworthiness campaigner @entity83 said : ' this is a scandal			2
it is criminal that nothing has been done			0
' the scale of these figures show there is a problem - why has it gone unchecked for so long ? ' defence minister @entity92 revealed the number of ' airprox incidents ' - near misses - in a parliamentary answer			1
an ' airprox ' incident is defined as a situation where two aircraft come so close together it has compromised safety			0
squadron leader @entity81 , 36 , and flight lieutenants @entity80 , 28 , and @entity77 , 27 , died when two £ 40million @entity22 warplanes crashed during a training mission over north - east @entity103			2
@entity105 @entity104 survived but was badly injured			0
the fighter - bombers , each carrying a pilot and a navigator , spun out of control and plunged into the @entity110 on july 2012			0
the crew were all from @entity112 based at @entity113			0
they were understood to be taking part in practice bombing runs in fog			0
wreckage : these chunks of the tornado jet planes were recovered from the @entity110 , above which two planes crashed last july the @entity7 confirmed last week it had identified a collision warning system for the fast jets four years before the fatal accident			1
the state - of - the - art £ 53.5million device was not finally approved for the @entity39 until october 2012 - three months after the tragedy			2
military sources said cost - saving in the cash - strapped @entity7 meant the @entity4 was forced to shelve the scheme in favour of other kit			0
defence chiefs might also have thought twice about spending millions of pounds upgrading warplanes that will be taken out of service in 2018			1
an @entity4 board of inquiry has completed a report on last summer 's collision and handed a copy to the procurator fiscal who will decide whether a fatal accident inquiry ( @entity144 ) will be held			2
the board 's findings have not been published			0
an @entity7 spokesman said : ' there are already a range of mitigation measures in place to minimise the risk of mid-air collision and tragic incidents such as that in @entity46 are extremely rare			1
' a specifically designed @entity156 , which will be another tool for pilots to use , is currently being trialled and will be in service in next year			0

new figures were uncovered by @entity34 mp @entity33
defence chiefs had pledge to fit tornado jets with a £ 55million collision *detection* device , but did not because of *budget* *constraints*
the system could have prevented a mid-air collision which killed three airmen last year
