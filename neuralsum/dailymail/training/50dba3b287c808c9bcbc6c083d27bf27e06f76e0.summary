the video @entity56 is *displaying* on their *website* is the trailer @entity240 approved of a month after her wedding and ' does n't represent ' the actual video
@entity10 was pregnant when she got the wedding video a year later and the stress from the *incident* dangerously *spiked* her blood sugar
