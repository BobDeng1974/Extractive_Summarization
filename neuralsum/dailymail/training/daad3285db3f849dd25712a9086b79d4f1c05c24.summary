with much fanfare and theatrics , @entity0 has unveiled its brand new flagship aircraft , the behemoth @entity5 , which boasts the world 's only penthouse in the sky , and the @entity9			1
stepping onto the @entity5 is more like arriving at a chichi business hotel than a plane			1
even the galley is like an elegant reception with chocolate brown and champagne - hued décor and ‘ food and beverage managers ’ looking as if they ’re about to go to a ball			1
turning left ( something most of us never do on an aircraft ) and ascending to the upper deck , one is taken straight to the airline ’s piece de resistance : the residence – a 125 - square - foot , three - room private suite , which comes with a @entity30 - trained butler and , according to the airline bosses , is already booked up and has had encouraging sales so far			1
guests will certainly avoid the usual hold - your - nose - and - think - of - @entity59 approach needed in most airborne lavatories			2
and it ’s hard to believe a double bed can fit on a plane , even the gargantuan @entity5			1
but there it is , beckoning weary and heavy - walleted travellers into its comfy fold			2
but it ’s all actually a little smaller than one might imagine , so as well as a seven - figure salary you 'll require a relatively trim physique to enjoy it			1
the airline declined to comment on who is on the waiting list to fly in the residence but with the hefty one - way price tag of £ 12,500 for single or double occupancy , the names @entity80 and mrs @entity81 spring to mind			1
super-rich , celebrities , perhaps even royalty will grace this quite unreal space – a design feat unchallenged by any other airline			0
guests who book the residence wake up to breakfast in bed and have their own private living room @entity0 says @entity92 has sold out for its initial flights between @entity94 and @entity44 @entity0 's @entity9 will enter commercial service with a flight from @entity44 to @entity97 @entity0 's @entity5 offers the world 's first penthouse in the sky - but costs £ 12,500 each way @entity103 , chief commercial officer of the @entity105 ' national airline , said : ‘ for a three - room cabin , it ’s not overpriced			1
effectively it ’s four times the price of a first class ticket , so that ’s double if you ’re travelling in a couple			2
’ to regain its prestige , the residence will not be available for upgrade			0
‘ it would lose its aspirational value , ’ said @entity103			0
the @entity5 is also the only @entity0 aircraft to offer the new @entity118 – a complete living space with reclining lounge chair and an ottoman which opens up to become a separate 80.5 - inch fully flat bed			1
new gig : on saturday @entity124 was announced as be the new face of @entity0 first class passengers can get total privacy , but if they ’re travelling together – or just want to get a little closer to their neighbour – the centre seats can be joined to create a double bed			1
in economy , the seats are no bigger with no added legroom , but passengers will benefit from revolutionary new pillows , which split in half to become comfortable travel pillows			0
the @entity5 enters commercial service on december 27 with daily flights between @entity44 and @entity140			2
journalists tour the first class cabin of a @entity143 , which enters commercial service in february the economy class cabin on @entity0 's new @entity5 feature ergonomically - designed seats for added comfort the @entity5 is also the only @entity149 to offer the new @entity118 – a complete living space @entity0 presented its new aircraft during a glitzy event at @entity44 's airport , where 200 members of the press gathered in a hangar draped in black			1
with a spectacular curtain drop , the @entity5 was unveiled to the sound of @entity160 ’ @entity161			2
the big event showcased @entity92 , @entity0 's revamped first class and business suites as well as a slightly tweaked economy cabin , and the carrier ’s fancy new livery – a mixture of ‘ desert ’ inspired browns and beiges and new interiors			1
the unveiling was followed by a fashion show featuring 22 cabin crew , who strutted down a catwalk donning the airline ’s brand new uniform			0
the airline has replaced its steely grey number with an autumnal , slightly seventies get - up designed by @entity185 haute couturier , @entity184			0
@entity0 chief president and chief executive officer , @entity187 , said : ‘ as we have done so many times in our short history , we are reshaping the landscape of modern air travel in our own way			2
' today is the culmination of many years of hard work and tremendous endeavour by hundreds of people both in our airline and outside			0
' perfectly suited for the launch of @entity0 's new aircraft , the cabin crew showed off their new work attire @entity0 has also revealed a total makeover for its cabin crew , from the classic steely grey skirts and jackets to browns and purples – and most notably , there is no longer a veil attached to female cabin crew ’s hats			1
chief commercial officer , @entity103 , told @entity215 : ‘ the modern @entity217 brand is rooted here , from the patterns in the ceiling inspired but the @entity221 , we are very respectful of the local culture			0
‘ @entity223 is what is going on in @entity44 , we are inspired by what ’s going on in the rest of the world , but through the lens of the local dna			2
' the new uniform designs are an opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from other airlines – whether there is a veil or not			0
’ but the brown is not to everyone ’s tastes			0
one female cabin crew member told @entity239 : ‘ i like the purple , it ’s more colourful than the old uniform			0
‘ and the brown goes with the new interiors			0
but with a cabin crew of 124 different nationalities , it ’s not going to suit everyone ’ while another admitted : ‘ when we saw it on the hanger , we were n’t sure			0
’ despite mixed opinions , the crew certainly looked impressive , in keeping with what must be one of the most lavish revamps in the history of air travel .			0
