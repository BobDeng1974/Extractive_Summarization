the pair had remained on friendly terms following their separation and @entity1 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , had visited mrs @entity12 and stayed overnight at her house in the past			1

' @entity39 , the dog , got onto the bed			1

' defendant : @entity1 , pictured leaving court with an unknown woman , had been kicked out of his house following an argument with his girlfriend and had sought out sympathy at his ex-wife 's home the jury was told @entity1 claims he was in the bed with the dog , but denies trying to have sex with it			1
following his arrest @entity1 provided police with a sample from his genitals and forensic examinations showed the dna of a dog was found , mr @entity40 told the court			1
he added : ' there is no doubt that that is the position and that supports what the witness said happened			0
' he told the jury they would have to consider the possibility the dog left dna on the bed and because @entity1 was naked it could have been picked up from the covers			1
but he also asked them to think about where the dna had been found on @entity1 ' penis			1
giving evidence , ms @entity12 , who was married to @entity1 from 1999 to 2002 , told the court the incident left her in ' utter shock '			1

i presumed that she 'd been seeing someone else			0
' she told the court that later that night she went upstairs and was looking through the banisters when she saw @entity1 with the dog			1
a bull mastiff : the jury was told @entity1 claims he was in the bed with the dog , but denies trying to have sex with it ( file picture ) she said : ' it was just too quiet , whereas he 'd been mumbling before , so i thought i would just go and check			1
' i did n't go all the way up , just halfway to the top banister			0

he jumped off the dog and laid down and just said he was tired			0
' ms @entity12 reported the incident to the police later that day after discussing the incident with their teenage daughters			0
but in cross-examination it was suggested to the court that it was @entity1 who spurned ms @entity12 's advances that night			1
' is n't it right that as mr @entity1 climbed over the dog to get into bed that you said " i bet you 'd rather shag the dog than me " ? ' @entity163 , defending , asked			1
' no , ' ms @entity12 said			0
miss @entity163 went on : ' you were spurred by him that night			0
