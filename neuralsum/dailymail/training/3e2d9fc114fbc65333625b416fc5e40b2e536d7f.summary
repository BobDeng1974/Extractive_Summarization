by @entity0 published : 14:22 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 15:09 est , 16 july 2013 a lesbian couple are threatening to sue for discrimination after being refused a family ticket to a bowling alley with their two sons			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , both 28 , who have been together since february , say they and their boys were upset to be told that families were made up of a husband and wife and two children			1
but the boss of the @entity17 company hit back at @entity18 , saying : ‘ she ’s not the only gay in the village – she was n’t refused a ticket because of her sexuality , but because of her foul language			1
’ @entity7 , with sons @entity24 , 6 , and @entity26 , 5 , and partner @entity8			1
the family claim they were discriminated against at a local bowling alley after trying to get a ' family deal ' he said the firm has gay directors and the manager of its other branch is gay			1
the very modern dispute – which carries echoes of a damages claim last year won by a gay couple barred from a bed and breakfast – broke out at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			2
miss @entity7 and @entity45 , who live together in nearby @entity46 , were having a day out with their respective children from previous heterosexual relationships – @entity24 , six , and @entity26 , five			1
the pair , who are planning to enter a civil partnership in august next year , said they asked for a family ticket at £ 15.50 , because buying individual tickets for two adults and two children would have cost £ 18.70			2
miss @entity7 , a delivery driver for @entity57 , said : ‘ the man looked at me blankly , then i said it a lot slower to try and get him to understand			1
‘ he said a husband and a wife and two children is a family – that made me mad			0
we had to prove we were a family so i showed the manager a picture of us which i had in my purse of us all together			0
‘ we are never going back			0
i did swear when i was there , but only because we were being discriminated against in front of the children			0
i ’m now looking into whether i can take legal action			0
’ but @entity17 in @entity43 , south east @entity73 , said the couple were not denied the deal because of their sexuality , but instead for a ' tirade of foul language ' they used against staff @entity17 has two branches , the other being at @entity83 in south @entity73			1
managing director @entity84 said a mechanic was on the front desk at the time the lesbian couple arrived , and he wanted to make sure the family paid the right amount			0
‘ his worry was n’t about the same - sex couple , his worry was he was going to let two people get together to get a cheaper deal			2
‘ he just said “ wait a moment ” because he did not want to get into trouble for manipulating the system and he said he would get the manager because he is just the mechanic			0
‘ then the lady went into a tirade of abuse			0
she was n’t refused because of any misunderstanding about a family ticket or her sexuality , she was refused because of the foul language			1
‘ i ’m not being funny here but she ’s not the only gay in the village			0
the company has gay directors and the manager of the @entity83 bowling alley is gay			0
’ last october bed - and - breakfast owner @entity116 from @entity117 in @entity118 was ordered to pay £ 3,600 in damages for ‘ hurt feelings ’ to a gay couple who she refused to let share a room .			2
