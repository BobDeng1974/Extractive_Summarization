when it comes to child tantrums , this is a serious flip out			1
a 10 - year - old boy has been filmed going completely berserk in a @entity5 @entity4 , leaving behind a trail of destruction in each aisle as shocked onlookers stand back and watch			1
a video of the december 9 incident - uploaded to @entity11 monday - comes to a head when the kid threatens to hit a customer , screaming : ' i 'm not afraid to do it ! ' at that moment a man - believed to be a store employee - sweeps up the problem child and carries him out front by the collar of his shirt			1
destruction : a video has emerged of a 10 - year - old going completely berserk in a @entity4 in @entity26 , @entity5 , on december 9 , which was uploaded to @entity11 on monday out - of - control : the child is alone in the shop and moves aisle - to - aisle emptying shelves dangerous : at one point the troublesome kid threatens to hit a customer that steps in ( right ) so bad was the child 's fury that the store called 911 , according to @entity41			1
it is not known whether the ' black male juvenile ' was arrested			2
the store would not comment on the incident when contacted by @entity46			1
however the video quickly spawned a wave of shocked complaints			1
it quickly became one of the top - voted posts on @entity53			2
' that kid ’s behavior is a call for help , ' one @entity53 user commented			1
' if i worked there , or if i was a cop , i ’d pick him up , and have him sit in on my lap in a kind of friendly forced hug and i ’d say “ i wo n’t let you go until you promise to tell me what ’s wrong			1
i know something is up , but i need you to tell me			0
” ( if you are a cop , then you probably do n’t need to hold him , talk is enough			0
) another added : ' this shows how spoilt children are today			0
can you honestly say this would 've happened in the 80 's ? no , because kids actually had respect in those days			0
' other users also agreed that the boy 's parents have alot to answer for			2
he appeared to be alone in the store			2
' yeah , i ’m imagining incredible abuse at home			0
this is n’t a kid who has parents who tuck him in and read to him every night , ' one person wrote			1
it was not immediately clear where the incident was filmed			0
about time : finally a man - believed to be a store employee - steps in and drags the kid out the man recording the video repeatedly refers to the boy as ' jit ' , which is prison slang for someone younger than you			1
other viewers were just as shocked that the man taking the video did n't step in and let the tantrum go on as long as it did			2
' i think the fact that no one stopped him is a large part of why kids get this way in the first place ; general societal and parental lenience where children			0
. the dear , dear , special children are concerned , ' one viewer wrote on @entity116			0
' it 's equally disturbing that an observer would rather tape and post this , than inform the management that mayhem has ensued			0
good decisions all around ! ( of course " management " is getting eight bucks an hour and was probably secretly glad for the entertainment and the vicarious release of hostility			0
) ' remember " look , but do n't touch " ? my parents taught me that very early			2
' i guess " you break it , you bought it			0
" does n't carry much sting at the @entity133			0
' scene : the incident occurred at the @entity4 on @entity136 in @entity26 , @entity5			1
