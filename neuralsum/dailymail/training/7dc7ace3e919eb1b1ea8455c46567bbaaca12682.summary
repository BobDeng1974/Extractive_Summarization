by @entity1 reporter half a million more immigrants arrived in @entity4 from the @entity5 than was previously believed , campaigners have warned			1
it means immigration between mid- 1997 and mid- 2010 , while @entity8 was in power , now totals nearly 4million , rather than the 3.4million recorded			1
the number of people who went under the radar would have filled a city the size of @entity16			2
the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) discovered the mistake in may when they compared the results of the 2011 census with the population that they had expected to find on the basis of births , deaths and official immigration figures , @entity17 said			1
the number of people arriving in @entity4 of the @entity5 was undercounted by half a million ( file picture ) the campaign group has written to the @entity32 watchdog to insist the @entity18 revises the official immigration numbers for the period - something the group claims it has refused to do			1
@entity17 chair sir @entity36 said : ' four million immigrants in 13 years is an astonishing figure - the highest in our history , including the @entity41 in 1066			1
' this new information underlines the scale of the task faced by the present government in getting the numbers down			0
' he added : ' there is no point in burying bad news in obscure documents			0
it is hard to think of a set of statistics that is more important to the public			0
' for the sake of public confidence in government statistics there must be a thorough revision of the immigration statistics and the new figures must be published without delay			2
' @entity17 added that allowing for the one million @entity4 citizens who emigrated in the period between 1997 and 2010 , net immigration comes to three million			1
the revelations come as @entity4 prepares for access restrictions to its labour market to be lifted for @entity72 and @entity73 at the end of the year			1
the @entity75 has so far refused to provide official estimates as ministers believe they would not be reliable			0
campaigners say immigration over 13 years to 2010 is the highest in @entity4 history at nearly four million but campaigners such as @entity17 have warned that up to 250,000 @entity72 and @entity73 could arrive in the first five years after the restrictions are lifted on january 1 , 2014			1
in a letter to @entity32 chairman sir @entity85 , sir @entity36 said the ' significance of the error underlines the scale of the task now facing the present government '			2
he added : ' it is hard to think of a statistical series that is more sensitive in terms of public opinion , particularly at present			0
' a statement from the @entity32 said : ' the @entity32 received a letter from sir @entity36 dated 8 july regarding long - term migration statistics			0
the authority is looking at the points raised and will respond publicly in due course			0
' @entity101 , head of population outputs at @entity18 , said : ' it is simply not true to suggest that @entity18 has " refused " to revise migration estimates			1
' @entity18 produced a revised population estimates series which incorporates the net migration findings from the @entity107			2
' the series , going back to 2002 , was published in december 2012			0
' at the same time we announced plans to publish a report analysing the quality of the long - term international migration data since 2001 , including impacts of the improvements made to the data since this period			0
this will be published in the autumn			0
