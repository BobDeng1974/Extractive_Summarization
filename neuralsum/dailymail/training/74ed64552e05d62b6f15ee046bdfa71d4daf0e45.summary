by @entity0 @entity2 the chameleon will have to say at least ten scale @entity3 after this devout display of piety			1
the religious reptile showed his true colours this week when he reached out to confess to a figurine of @entity10			1
the shade - shifting lizard , from @entity12 , suddenly seemed overcome by a sense of his own mortality as he sat down to tuck into his dinner of praying mantis ... so he said a little prayer of his own			0
he reached out his claws to the eight - inch statuette of the patron saint of animals - and then climbed on top of its head			2
say three scale @entity28 's : @entity2 the chameleon was being fed by owner @entity30 when he decided he could n't wait to get closer to @entity31 penitent : he reached out his claws in prayer to an eight - inch high statue of the patron saint of animals owner @entity30 , 43 , said his pet was far more interested in celebrating the holy man than in the mantis he was given to eat			1
the tv repairman , who was in his lounge in @entity12 , said : ' when he saw my @entity10 figure , @entity2 immediately reached out to him			1
nearer to heaven : when he had finished his act of penitence , he then climbed onto @entity10 ' head ' i grabbed my camera to catch a few photos of him praying to the statue like a devout believer			2
' i guessed he might move onto the ornament to be closer to him , and sure enough he did			0
' after i got a couple shots of him on top of the statue i took him off , but he looked very content and probably would have sat there for quite some time			0
' deciding which is my favourite image is proving to be as difficult as deciding on his name			0
' at first , i liked the photo of him grabbing the statue 's hand the best , but now i think i prefer him reaching out to him with his arms wide open			2
' i have a great love of animals and what @entity10 stands for , so the way these came together makes me feel good			0

@entity2 the chameleon reached out and held hand of @entity10 statue
he then appeared to pray , spreading arms and looking up to the animal saint
owner @entity30 : ' when he saw the figure , he just reached out to him '
