by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 15:23 est , 28 february 2013 for sports fans , it could be a whole new way to watch - and really feel like you are part of the game			0
@entity6 researchers have revealed a ' ball - cam ' mounted inside an @entity8			1
they have developed special software to process the footage , giving viewers a ' clean ' video from the camera as the ball spins high above a football field			1
because a football can spin at 600 rpm , the raw video is an unwatchable blur			0
however , the researchers developed a computer algorithm that converts the raw video into a stable , wide - angle view			1
' we 're interested in how technology can be used to enhance existing sports and how it might be used to create new sports , ' said @entity44 , one of the research team			0
' in some cases , athletic play may be combined with arts or entertainment ; a camera - embedded ball , for instance , might be used to capture the expressions on the face of players as they play catch with it			2
' when the ball is thrown in a clean spiral , the camera records a succession of frames as the ball rotates			2
when processing these frames , the algorithm uses the sky to determine which frames were made when the camera was looking up and which were made when it was looking down			0
the upward frames are discarded and the remaining , overlapping frames are stitched together with special software to create a large panorama			1
similar stitching software is used by @entity73 to combine images from @entity76 rovers into large panoramas and is increasingly found in digital cameras			0
@entity79 , a post-doctoral fellow in @entity26 's @entity80 , says a football league is unlikely to approve camera - embedded footballs for regular play , but says the @entity84 might be useful for tv , movie productions or training purposes			2
multiple cameras might also be added to the football to improve the finished video			0
the researchers have shown that a camera embedded in the side of a rubber - sheathed plastic foam football can record video while the ball is in flight that could give spectators a unique , ball 's - eye view of the playing field .			1

researchers placed a camera inside an @entity8
special software processes the image so it gives a clear view - even though the ball is spinning
