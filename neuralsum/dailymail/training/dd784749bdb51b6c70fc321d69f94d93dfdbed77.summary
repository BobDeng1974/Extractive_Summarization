by @entity0 images have been released allegedly showing rockets being fired from @entity3 into @entity4 , and heavy artillery being rolled across the border to be used by @entity8 rebels in the country 's ongoing civil war			1
the @entity12 government released the images today , which support claims that @entity3 has been providing heavy arms to rebels in @entity17 and luhansk - parts of @entity4 under separatist control			1
a four - page document released from the @entity21 seems to show blast marks from where rockets were launched and craters where they landed			0
officials said the images , sourced from the @entity12 director of national intelligence , show heavy weapons fired between july 21 and july 26			0
' proof ' : the @entity21 release and annotated the above image , dated almost a week ago			0
it seems to show rockets within @entity4 - and therefore operated by the rebels - firing rockets at @entity39 positions close to the @entity3 border ' @entity41 ' : the above image , taken on wednesday shows @entity3 artillery vehicles firing over the border towards a @entity39 position , which is surrounded by shell holes such evidence will also fuel suspicions that the rebels could have been given a surface - to - air missile by @entity3 which was then used to shoot down flight @entity51 near the @entity3 border more than a week ago			1
the theory is widely accepted by @entity55 powers , but the rebels in @entity17 have defended themselves from the charges by claiming they had no weapons which could possibly reach high enough to touch a passenger jet at 33,000ft			0
the @entity12 images claim to show multiple rocket launchers fired at @entity39 forces from within @entity4 and from @entity3 soil			1
one shows dozens of craters around a @entity39 military unit and rockets that can travel more than 7 miles			0
in a memo attached to the images , @entity12 officials said : ' the wide area of impacts near the @entity39 military units indicates fire from multiple rocket launchers '			2
' @entity3 - backed attacks ' : the above before - and - after image purports to show a @entity39 unit after it has been shelled by separatists tensions have run high around @entity4 since @entity3 seized @entity80 in march			1
@entity81 has also been highly critical of @entity3 president @entity83 's behaviour concerning the handling of the @entity86 crash , as well as the rest of the conflict in @entity4			0
more recently , @entity12 intelligence officials have said they have what they call a solid circumstantial case that @entity3 - backed separatists in @entity4 are responsible for downing the @entity94 plane			1
citing satellite imagery , intercepted conversations and social media postings , officials say a @entity3 - made @entity100 surface - to - air missile hit the plane on july 17			2
@entity101 angrily denies any involvement in the attack			0
@entity12 officials said they still do n't know who fired the missile or whether @entity3 military officers were present when it happened , and had previously declined to share any proof that the separatists had the technology to down a plane .			2

government releases satellite shots from the past week it says show artillery and rocket launchers being moved
intelligence sources claim the pictures show that both @entity3 - armed rebels and @entity3 itself are attacking @entity4
three images show paths of rockets and shells directed at @entity39 army emplacements near border in @entity17
@entity12 also *believes* that a @entity3 - made missile given to separatists was used to shoot down flight @entity51 over @entity4
