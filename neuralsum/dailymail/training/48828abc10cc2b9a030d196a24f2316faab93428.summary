by @entity0 - parkinson published : 06:09 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 27 march 2013 @entity1 set up a website in her ex-husband 's new , distinctive name a bitter divorce battle has led to a regulator ruling that individuals do not have the right to protect their names in web addresses in the same way as registered companies			1
@entity1 , 49 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , set up a website in her ex-husband 's distinctive surname after he re-married			1
@entity18 and his new wife , @entity19 , became @entity20 and mrs @entity21 , prompting mrs @entity1 to set up hvidbro - mitchell.co.uk			1
mrs @entity22 launched a dispute with @entity24 , claiming mrs @entity1 has since used the site as a forum for hate , protest and obsessive criticism of her ex-husband			1
mrs @entity22 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , said that whenever her name is typed into @entity35 the website comes out at the top of search results			2
she went to @entity24 , the organisation that polices web domains in the @entity40 , to strip mrs @entity1 , who has remarried , of the web address			1
however , @entity24 ruled in mrs @entity1 's favour saying there is ' no free - standing right of personality ' and , however unusual mrs @entity22 's name may be , she can not stop mrs @entity47 from using it			1
@entity24 has ruled in favour of celebrities in the past because they have registered their names as trade marks			2
mrs @entity22 argued that , even in her homeland of @entity57 , only a tiny handful of people bear the name @entity59			0
the traditional name is protected under @entity57 law and she had been unable to find anyone in the world who used it in a hyphenated form			0
mrs @entity1 's ' personal , emotive and one - sided ' criticisms of her ex-husband on the website were having a knock - on effect on her and had caused ' anxiety and distress ' to her two children , she told @entity24 expert , @entity72			1
she claimed the domain name had been ' deliberately selected in bad faith ' and was being used by @entity47 as part of a ' campaign ' against her ex-husband ' to mislead members of the public and attract them to the website under false pretences '			1
mrs @entity22 said that references to her children 's school and home addresses were only removed from the website in response to a police visit to mrs @entity1 's home			1
@entity18 and @entity87 had hoped mrs @entity1 would be ordered to take down the website the name , which she has borne since 2002 and which is ' unique to her family ' , was ' a very significant and important part of her personal identity ' , she argued			1
but mrs @entity1 , who split from her ex-husband more than a decade ago , denied having done anything wrong and insisted the website was a legitimate means of highlighting his alleged failure to meet child maintenance and court costs orders			1
the domain has nothing to do with mrs @entity22 and that was made clear on the website , she said			2
the police had taken no action against her and had not warned her or advised her to make any changes to her website			2
refusing to transfer the domain name to mrs @entity22 , mr @entity72 said : ' there is no free - standing general right of personality , i.e. a right by which a person with a particular name can seek to prevent the use of that name by others			0
' in other words , the mere fact that someone has a particular name is not of itself sufficient to found a cause of action ... the name @entity22 may be very unusual but it does not belong to the complainant in the proprietary sense			0
' the list of people who share that surname may be a very short list , in reality it is probably only her immediate family , but that does not justify the leap in reasoning to the conclusion that it is her unique name over which she has rights			0
' it is abundantly clear on the evidence that the target of mrs @entity1 's wrath was not , in fact , the complainant at all ; it was her husband , who shares the same surname			2
' i am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that mrs @entity22 has rights in a name which is identical or similar to the domain name '			0
mrs @entity22 's case having fallen at the first hurdle , mr @entity72 said it was unnecessary for him to decide whether the domain name was an ' abusive registration ' in mrs @entity1 's hands			1
in reaching its decision , @entity24 looked at previous cases over the issue of rights in personal names that have been registered as trade marks			0
they include the following : @entity167 make - up tutor and supplier using her own name to trade			0
she built up a reputation with her business and it was therefore deemed appropriate that she had trademark rights to her name			0
@entity176 complaints were received including one that pointed out that a number of registered trademarks use the name @entity181			0
@entity182 acting for @entity183 contacted @entity24 after the domain was registered by a man called @entity186			0
when they contacted mr @entity186 directly he responded saying : ' thank you for your email and letter regarding the domain name fayed.co.uk			0
' although we would have loved to have been able to simply donate this domain to your truly dreadful and odious client i regret to inform you that we have recently sold this domain			0
' attempts were made to contact a mr @entity183 , but @entity24 was not convinced he existed and ruled that ' the trademarks and the " alfayed " domain names are held by @entity200 ' .			2

@entity1 set up a website to vent her fury at her ex-husband using his name in the web address
domain regulator ruled that she could keep the website
