mr @entity3 wore the camera as he caught @entity13 , a 10ft female gator who weighs 500lb , at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the 34 - year - old even opens the reptile 's mouth with his hands while an awestruck crowd watch			1
mr @entity3 , who treats and cares for the rescued animals , said he became involved with @entity42 10 years ago , when he signed up for a wrestling class			1
and his work at the farm is in stark contrast to his day job as a crematory manager			0

' @entity13 is one of the original gators we got from @entity89 and she is extremely large - with the average size for a female being around eight foot			2
' we have geothermal wells that keep the water hot - that 's the reason we can have gators in one of the coldest places in the @entity98 - and it 's also why we have such big and healthy gators			2
