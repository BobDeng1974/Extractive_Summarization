as the lethal dose of pentobarbital began taking effect , he took a few breaths and then made one slightly audible snore before all movement stopped			0
@entity13 never looked toward @entity16 ' mother , two brothers and two other relatives who watched through a window			2
he selected no witnesses of his own			0
several dozen police officers and supporters of the slain patrolman revvied their motorcycles outside the prison before witnesses were let inside the death chamber			0
the execution , the first this year in the nation 's most active death penalty state , came after the @entity46 @entity45 and lower federal courts rejected last - day appeals and @entity5 officials spurned arguments that @entity13 's case was tainted because he was n't informed , under an international agreement , that he could get legal help from the @entity4 consulate after his arrest for the officer 's slaying			1
@entity13 's weeping cousin @entity58 was amongst a group of his relatives who gather at his parents home in @entity62 , @entity4 , while he was being executed in @entity5 attorneys had also argued unsuccessfully that @entity13 was mentally impaired , making him ineligible for execution , and that the state 's clemency procedures were unfair			1
the @entity67 on tuesday had rejected @entity13 's request for clemency			2
' it does n't matter where you 're from , ' @entity71 spokeswoman @entity70 said			0
' if you commit a despicable crime like this in @entity5 , you are subject to our state laws , including a fair trial by jury and the ultimate penalty			2
' @entity16 , who had been on the force for two years , was driving @entity13 and another man from a robbery scene when evidence showed the officer was shot three times in the head and neck with a pistol @entity13 had concealed in his pants			2
the car crashed , and @entity13 fled on foot but was captured a few blocks away , still in handcuffs , carrying the robbery victim 's watch and wearing the victim 's necklace			0
@entity4 officials and @entity13 's attorneys contend he was protected under a provision of the 1963 @entity103			1
protestors calling for a stay of execution gathered to sing and chant outside the prison unit where @entity13 was executed in @entity108 , @entity5 on wednesday night legal assistance guaranteed under that treaty could have uncovered evidence to contest the capital murder charge or provide evidence to keep @entity13 off death row , they said			1
records show the consulate became involved or aware of the case just as his trial was to begin			0
secretary of state @entity119 previously asked @entity5 attorney general @entity120 to delay @entity13 's punishment , saying it ' could impact the way @entity46 citizens are treated in other countries			1
' the @entity11 repeated that stance on wednesday			0
but @entity120 's office and the @entity129 district attorney opposed any delays			0
at least two other inmates in circumstances similar to @entity13 's were executed in @entity5 in recent years			1
the family of slain @entity7 police officer @entity16 enters the prison unit to witness the execution of @entity13 in @entity108 , @entity5 , on wednesday night the @entity4 government said in a statement this week it ' strongly opposed ' the execution and said failure to review @entity13 's case and reconsider his sentence would be ' a clear violation by the @entity46 of its international obligations			1
' @entity13 was in the @entity46 illegally and had a criminal record in @entity146 , where he had served time for robbery and was paroled , according to prison records			2
he was among more than four dozen @entity4 nationals awaiting execution in the @entity46 when the @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154 , ruled in 2004 they had n't been advised properly of their consular rights			1
the @entity45 subsequently said hearings urged by the international court in those inmates ' cases could be mandated only if @entity160 implemented legislation to do so			0
' unfortunately , this legislation has not been adopted , ' the @entity4 foreign ministry acknowledged .			0

@entity13 , 46 , received a lethal injection in @entity5 on wednesday night for the 1994 fatal shooting of @entity7 police officer @entity16 , 24
