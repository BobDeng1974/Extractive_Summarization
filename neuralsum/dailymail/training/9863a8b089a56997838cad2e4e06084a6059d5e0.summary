' @entity2 has been in an induced coma at the @entity54 since he fell while skiing on december 29			1
@entity55 , a former @entity21 doctor , said ' wakening ' would mean that @entity2 has opened his eyes			1
he said : ' this eye opening can even be cyclic , following what looks just like a sleep - wake cycle ( even if not synchronised to real day - night hours )			0
' and he said the ' moments of consciousness ' meant that @entity2 would have had interaction with his environment			1

' for example , if @entity2 smiles when a member of his entourage talks to him - reproducibly and consistently on at least a few occasions			2
or following people with his eyes			0

any of this constitutes objective signs of contact between the " outside " and the " inside "			0
