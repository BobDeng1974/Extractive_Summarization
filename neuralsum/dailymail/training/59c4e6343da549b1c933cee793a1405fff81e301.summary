but somewhere along the way , i had been completely hooked			2
i knew i would go back			0

breakfast : bowl of @entity124 and toast lunch : chicken tikka sandwich dinner : @entity129 and chips snacks : several chunky chocolate bars breakfast : porridge and fruit lunch : wholemeal pasta and tomato sauce dinner : grilled chicken and vegetables snacks : granola bars or fruit ' instead , there was a sense that everyone was in it together			2
it was a very eclectic bunch , motivated by a desire to ‘ go hard or go home ’			0
it was much more my kind of thing			0
' she also radically changed her diet as the physical exercise put her more in tune with her body ’s nutritional requirements			2
