by @entity0 @entity2 agents and other law enforcement officials will now be able to record interviews with suspects after the @entity6 overturned a longstanding policy			1
the new policy , laid out in a memo issued this week by deputy attorney general @entity10 , establishes a ' presumption ' that agents will record interviews with suspects who have been taken into custody but have not yet appeared in court			1
the policy , which is to take effect july 11 , covers the @entity2 as well as the @entity17 , @entity18 and the @entity19			1
more evidence : the reversal will allow agents to use the information they collect in interviews as proof in subsequent trials that new standard replaces current practice , in which agents interview suspects without recording them , take handwritten notes and then produce a report summarizing the conversation			1
it addresses concerns from civil rights groups and defense lawyers who say the absence of recordings leaves too many ambiguities as to what precisely was said and whether agents ' accounts are fully reliable			0
the policy is also intended to ensure that law enforcement has a clear record of any confession or critical statement , and that interviews with suspects are properly done			2
' i think it is a tremendous step forward by the department in recognizing that having an accurate record of what is said in the custodial interrogation is helpful , both to the government and to the defense , ' said @entity60 , a criminal defense lawyer in @entity61			0
decision maker : the reversal was laid out in a memo issued this week by deputy attorney general @entity10 he said one of the leading causes for false confessions is not having an accurate understanding of the context in which the statement was made still , he noted , the change is narrow in scope since it applies only to interviews with suspects who have already been arrested or are in custody			2
the policy change allows for some exceptions , including if the suspect objects to the recording , if the recording is not practical or if the information provided in the interview could jeopardize national security			2
the @entity85 posted the memo on its website			0
a @entity6 spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of memo			0
the spokesperson was not authorized to discuss a change that had not been announced and requested anonymity .			0

new policy will allow for a ' presumption ' that all interviews with agents are recorded
will apply to the @entity2 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19
change *begins* on july 11 and comes after years where agents had to take handwritten notes of interviews
