by @entity1 reporter published : 00:43 est , 11 march 2012 updated : 02:31 est , 11 march 2012 a couple who sued a hospital for not telling them their unborn child has @entity3 's syndrome has been awarded a $ 2.9million payout			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , who say they would have had an abortion if they had known the child would be disabled , claimed they needed the money to pay for their daughter @entity17 's lifelong care			1
and a jury agreed , deciding on friday that @entity23 's @entity22 hospital had been negligent in failing to diagnose the condition in a pre-natal scan			1
the hospital is considering appealing the verdict , but the @entity29 ' lawyer urged them to ' let this case finally come to an end '			1
happy : @entity32 , pictured with her brothers , was born with @entity34 after a botched prenatal test failed to spot the condition the couple from @entity38 , who have two other children , said in a lawsuit they would have aborted their daughter @entity17 - who is now four - if they had known she had @entity3 's syndrome			1
although they say they love @entity17 and treat her the same as their other children , the @entity29 demanded a huge payout from the hospital to pay for the extra medical care she requires			2
they accused the hospital of being ' negligent in their performance , analysis and reporting ' after misreading mrs @entity10 's ultrasound scan			2
their lawyer @entity56 said the parents had launched their lawsuit in an effort to care for @entity60 better			0
' these are parents who love this little girl very , very much , ' he said			2
' their mission since the beginning was to provide for her and that 's what this is all about			2
' after the jury awarded the couple $ 2.9million , a spokesman for @entity70 said the organisation disputed the decision			2
' while @entity22 has great respect for the judicial process , we are disappointed in today 's verdict , ' he said			2
' the legal team from @entity22 will be reviewing the record and considering available options			0
' but mr @entity56 said : ' i would hope that @entity70 would embrace this jury verdict and let this case finally come to an end			2
' parents : @entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right , claim they have received death threats for their comments sued : the @entity29 sued @entity22 for $ 3 million as they believe staff botched their prenatal test the case could have far - reaching - and questionable - implications for children born with with conditions such as @entity3 's			1
there are fewer than 10 ' wrongful birth ' cases in the @entity98 every year as prenatal tests are 99.7 per cent accurate - and few parents want to face a legal challenge if they do fail , the @entity94 reported			1
yet experts believe there could be a boom in the lawsuits as women in their late 30s and 40s are increasingly having babies and relying on genetic screenings to signal problems , the paper added			0
civil engineer @entity9 and dental hygienist @entity10 , who say they love @entity17 and intend to give her the same opportunities they have given their sons , were stunned when hospital staff told them she appeared to have @entity3 's			1
tests carried out before a baby is born to determine whether they have any genetic disorders is called chorionic villus sampling , or @entity123 for short			1
it usually takes place between the 10th and 12th week of a pregnancy ,			0
the test is not given to every expectant mother , but some factors give rise to it			1
it is carried out if a woman has abnormal screen results in the first trimester of her pregnancy , or if there is a family history of genetic disorders or chromosome abnormalities			0
women over the age of 35 are also encouraged to have the test , as there is an increased risk of @entity34			2
it involves taking tissue from the foetus while in the womb and screening this sample for abnormalities			1
@entity10 , 39 , told doctors she had taken a test - a chorionic villus sampling , or @entity123 for short - before the birth and that the results had showed their child would be normal			1
' we were told we had nothing to worry about , ' @entity158 told jurors			0
but days after @entity17 was born , her mother was taking her to the doctor ' to show her off ' and he delivered the blow - a blood test confirmed the baby had @entity3 's			1
' it was devastating , ' mrs @entity10 said			0
mr @entity56 claimed in the case that dr @entity169 removed tissue in the womb from mrs @entity10 , rather than from the baby , when he carried out the procedure at the clinic			1
the suit points the blame at the doctor and lab workers who did not realise they were testing maternal tissue , the @entity94 reported			0
it also suggests that two later ultrasounds carried out by @entity70 showed traits of the syndrome , yet staff failed to recognise these , and assured mrs @entity10 her baby would be born normal and healthy			1
yet the attorneys for the defense claim @entity169 and the staff followed correct procedures			0
he suggested the problem was that the girl has mosaic down syndrome			0
whereas most people with the condition have cells containing an extra 21st chromosome , a significant number of @entity60 's cells did not , @entity169 said			2
nearly 31 per cent were normal			2
yet mr @entity56 countered that obviously 100 per cent of the cells taken in the @entity123 test were normal - as they had wrongly been taken from the mother			1
he added that tests carried out after @entity17 was born show there is less than one or two per cent normal cells			1
reports have previously quoted the lawsuit as demanding as much as $ 14 million to cover the cost of the young girl 's care			2
legal team : @entity213 ( @entity214 ) said @entity17 has @entity3 's , so fewer cells contain the chromosome associated with the syndrome			1
@entity56 ( r ) said the clinic took tissue from the mother , not the fetus decisions : judge @entity223 is presided over the case the couple has already whipped up a frenzy of hate and abuse for their comments over aborting their beloved daughter			1
@entity56 said they have received death threats			1
the couple met in preschool , attended the same high school and college and married in 2000			0
civil engineer @entity9 and dental hygienist @entity10 , both 39 , are orthodox jewish , according to @entity240			0
their sons are in third grade and kindergarten			0
the boys , shown hugging their younger sister tightly in photographs , are bright - one has placed in the 99th percentile on standardised tests			1
the third pregnancy , when mrs @entity10 was 34 , was a ' surprise ' , according to the @entity23 paper			0
due to her age , the couple was vigilant about testing , undergoing the @entity123 at 13 weeks			0
it is believed one in 250 women at that age give birth to a child with @entity34			0
studies suggest that more than 89 per cent of women choose to abort a fetus with @entity34			0
after their daughter was born with the syndrome , the @entity29 expressed their fears over her future , including medical and social issues , and whether she would get the required educational support			0
experts have told them she will probably not be able to live on her own or support herself , the @entity94 reported			0
it is estimated she will live until her mid- 50s			0
she is able to speak in two - word sentences which only her parents and a few others understand , according to the @entity94			0
yet the @entity29 say @entity280 , who has down syndrome and earned a @entity283 degree , is a role model for their child .			0

a prenatal test showed couple 's daughter would be ' normal and healthy '
*shocked* when blood tests after the birth confirmed the baby had @entity3 's
botched test ' had taken sample from the mother rather than the foetus '
say they love their daughter - but have received death threats over the case
