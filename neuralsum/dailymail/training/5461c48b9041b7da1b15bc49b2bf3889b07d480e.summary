by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 15 may 2013 @entity2 's surgeon has revealed in detail the treatment the 37 - year - old actress had before , during and after her preventative mastectomy procedure			1
the actress made the brave decision to have three months of secret procedures after being told she had an 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer due to the @entity12 gene			1
@entity2 is said to already be planning her next surgery - the removal of both her ovaries - as the gene means she has a 50 per cent chance of developing ovarian cancer			1
now , in a blog post on the @entity21 website , her surgeon dr @entity18 has explained the different stages of @entity2 's medical treatment to help other women seeking information about brca gene mutations and what it might mean for them			1
@entity2 's surgeon has revealed in detail the treatment the 37 - year - old actress had before , during and after her preventative mastectomy procedure in a blog post on the @entity21 website , @entity2 's surgeon dr @entity18 ( right ) has explained the type of nipple sparing surgery and reconstructive treatment she had speaking about @entity2 's journey and recovery , she said : ' to a large extent , i believe recovery reflects expectation			1
@entity2 expected to feel well , to be active			1
' on monday , the pathology returned and i called @entity2 to confirm our biggest hope : all of the breast tissue was benign			1
' on day four after her mastectomies , i was pleased to find her not only in good spirits with bountiful energy , but with two walls in her house covered with freshly assembled storyboards for the next project she is directing			0
' all the while she spoke , six drains dangled from her chest , three on each side , fastened to an elastic belt around her waist			0
dr @entity18 added : ' it is important to emphasize that each woman ’s case is different			1
surgery will not necessarily be the right choice for everyone , and there are alternatives available			2
as @entity2 says in her article , the important thing is to be aware of your options			1
' the first stage , says dr @entity18 , is to gather data and information			1
' @entity12 stands for @entity77			0
@entity12 genes help you fight cancer when it happens in your body			2
' women carrying @entity12 or @entity84 gene mutations have up to an 87 per cent lifetime chance of breast cancer and 54 per cent chance of ovarian cancer vs. a general population risk of 12 per cent for breast cancer and less than 1 per cent for ovarian cancer			1
dr @entity18 said that @entity2 's partner brad @entity93 was on hand to greet her as soon as she came around from the anesthetic , as he was during each of the operations speaking about @entity2 's journey and recovery , dr @entity18 said : ' to a large extent , i believe recovery reflects expectation			1
@entity2 expected to feel well , to be active ' ' given the high likelihood of getting breast or ovarian cancer with @entity12 mutations , family history usually triggers testing for the gene			1
@entity2 ’s mother had breast cancer , and sadly passed away from ovarian cancer			1
her maternal grandmother was also diagnosed with ovarian cancer			2
' women carrying a brca mutation then undergo a surveillance plan involving mammograms , breast examinations , pelvic ultrasounds and blood tests to check for @entity123 , which is a marker of ovarian cancer			1
if and when a woman commits to a preventative mastectomy , there are a number of questions a woman has to address , says dr @entity18			1
the first is whether or not to preserve the nipples			0
' women undergoing preventive mastectomies can always consider keeping their nipples			0
' @entity2 had a technique called @entity138 , performed one to two weeks before the actual mastectomies			2
this uses the planned mastectomy incision and lifts half of the skin off of the breast surface			2
' a small disc of the tissue directly behind the nipple and areola is also removed and analyzed by a pathologist , ' says dr @entity18			1
@entity2 's decision to have the preventative mastectomy was prompted by the fact she lost her mother , @entity153 ( left ) , to ovarian cancer at the age of 56 ' this is done to rule out the presence of any disease directly behind the nipples , which would make preserving them a dangerous proposition			1
additionally , it recruits extra blood flow to the area , lessening the chances of nipple and skin loss due to insufficient blood supply after the mastectomy			2
' @entity2 was in the operating room for the first operation , the nipple delay , on february 2 , 2013			1
' her partner was on hand to greet her as soon as she came around from the anesthetic , as he was during each of the operations , ' said dr @entity18			1
' after the operation , her skin was slightly bruised but soon returned to normal			0
two days after her procedure , great news arrived : the tissue behind both nipples came back completely normal			0
' on february 16 , she had the main surgery , which can last up to eight hours			2
the mastectomies went smoothly , with sentinel nodes identified but not removed			0
' dr @entity18 said @entity186 had a procedure called nipple delay to preserve her nipples and an implant reconstruction with allograft when it came to the incisions , ' for @entity2 , her optimal incision choices were around the areola , or underneath the breast in the inframammary fold – the latter was chosen , ' says dr @entity18			1
' after the mastectomies , i assisted plastic surgeon , dr. @entity201 , as we performed the first stage breast reconstruction by placing tissue expanders with allograft			0
' implants are the most common reconstruction , often requiring two stages , whereby a tissue expander is placed prior to the final implant			0
' a tissue expander is a deflated implant that goes behind the pectoral muscles and gets slowly inflated with saline over a period of 2 - 3 months , until the chosen volume is reached			0
a second operation is performed to swap the expander for the final implant ( usually silicone )			0
she adds that ' @entity2 ’s body type was best suited to an implant reconstruction with allograft			1
' this uses synthetic sheets of material , that create a more natural look			0
although tissue expanders required an additional operation , she preferred to use them			0
' the next day she had her first injection of saline into the expanders , thus beginning the process that would gradually prepare the tissues for the final stage of her operations , reconstruction			0
' four of the six drains were removed			0
four days after that , on postoperative day nine , the last two drains were removed			0
a second saline fill occurred on march 4			0
over the next four weeks she was hard at work			0
' the final operation occurred on april 27 , 2013 , ten weeks after the mastectomies : reconstruction of the breasts with implant , which went extremely well , bringing an end to her surgical journey			0
' dr @entity18 says @entity2 also followed a strict regimen of supplements to both prepare and recover from surgery			1
this included : to enhance wound healing ( for each operation ) : vitamin c : 1000mg tablets ; one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after @entity262 : one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after @entity264 : 50 mg ; one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after surgery			2
to reduce the risk of infection : @entity270 ointment : @entity271 twice a day beginning 3 days prior to surgery x 7 @entity274 shower : @entity276 soap applied to upper torso and abdomen – left on for 5 minutes , then rinsed			2
@entity271 once a day for 3 days prior to @entity279 : 250mg ( antibiotic ) ; one tablet 4x a day for 7 days , beginning with 2 doses the day of the operation			2
to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting ( for each operation ) : emend : 40mg ; one tablet by mouth the night before surgery to reduce postoperative swelling and bruising ( for each operation ) : @entity291 ( @entity292 and @entity293 ) : two capsules daily x 7 days , beginning one day prior to @entity295 help eliminate anesthesia from the system ( for each operation ) : @entity299 : 10 drops in water or directly in the mouth twice daily , beginning the day before surgery and continuing for one week after surgery			1
@entity305 : 10 drops in water or directly in the mouth twice daily , beginning the day before surgery and continuing for one week after surgery			2
to increase oxygen to the skin ( operations 1 and 2 ) : @entity313 : @entity271 to breast every 6 hours x 3 days			0
skin care specialists use this topical cream after laser resurfacing to increase oxygen flow to the outer layers of skin			0
we decided in @entity2 ’s case to apply it to the mastectomy skin to give it an oxygen boost and to help ensure adequate blood flow to her skin postoperatively			2
to minimise scarring ( after operation 3 ) : @entity331 : rubbed into scars twice a day for 12 weeks – begin after the third operation once steri strips are removed			0
plus various medications needed for pain .			0
