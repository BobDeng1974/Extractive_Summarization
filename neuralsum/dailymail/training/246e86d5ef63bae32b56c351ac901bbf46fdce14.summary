by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:04 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 17:05 est , 8 september 2012 football fans are being kept in the dark about how many top players have been disciplined for taking recreational drugs such as cocaine , marijuana and ecstasy			0
a mail on sunday investigation has discovered that since 2010 details of failed drug tests that were formerly made public by a government - funded drugs watchdog have not been disclosed			1
until then , an average of six to seven failed tests for recreational drugs were reported every year , including high - profile cases such as that of former @entity20 striker @entity19 who tested positive for cocaine in 2004			1
cover up : incidents of any players failing tests for cocaine have not been reported since 2010 the @entity26 , whose chairman is @entity29 , said there had been new , unreported cases during the past two - and - half - years , but would not give details			1
however , a spokesman said that following the @entity36 ’s investigation it would now explore ways to make the information public			2
the @entity36 contacted all of the @entity41 ’s 20 clubs yesterday			0
@entity42 said they were unaware any of their players had been caught taking drugs , eight failed to respond and @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 refused to comment			0
until early 2010 , @entity51 @entity50 ( @entity52 ) , the agency that leads the fight against drug - taking in sport , would routinely make public the details of every case in the @entity51 when a footballer failed a test , both for performance - enhancing and recreational drugs			1
@entity62 of @entity63 , left , missed games because his club claimed he needed an operation , but he was suspended for cocaine use			0
the @entity26 , whose chairman is @entity29 , right , said new unreported cases of drug use had been detected in the last two - and - a - half years although the player and club were rarely identified , the substance involved , the date of the failed test and the length of any ban imposed would all be included in a database open to the public on @entity52 ’s website			1
even before @entity52 dropped its policy of reporting recreational drug offences , critics claimed that the lack of transparency over identifying offenders allowed clubs to deceive fans by claiming that players banned over drugs were not playing because of injury			2
the @entity94 programme dispatches revealed last year that in 2009 @entity63 claimed its player @entity62 had missed games because he needed an operation on a hip injury when in reality he had been suspended by the @entity26 for two months after failing a drugs test for cocaine			0
dispatches claimed that @entity52 , which was established in 2009 , and its predecessor caught a total of 43 professional footballers using cocaine , ecstasy or cannabis			0
under current rules , footballers face two types of drugs tests			0
one is for the use of performance - enhancing substances during games , under which randomly selected players are required by @entity52 to provide urine tests at full - time			1
admission : the @entity26 , based in @entity119 , pictured , says there are new drug cases the other test is carried out on behalf of the @entity26 specifically to unearth recreational drug use during the players ’ leisure time , and often involve @entity52 staff descending on clubs with little notice			1
while the @entity26 is not obliged to perform tests for recreational drugs , it says the practice is part of its wider responsibility to ensure the game is clean			2
players who fail tests face an @entity26 tribunal and punishments range from fines to bans			0
after @entity52 decided to stop reporting ‘ recreational positives ’ on its database , it also removed all past ‘ social drugs findings ’ as well			0
a @entity52 spokesman said : ‘ it was considered inappropriate for @entity147 to continue to publish this information since it related to testing undertaken outside of the @entity150 , so it is not “ our ” information or data to publish or process			2
’ the @entity26 , which claimed that it did not know that @entity52 had stopped revealing the drug tests until approached by @entity36 , said it banned recreational drugs at all times because of the wider social implications .			1

mail on sunday investigation finds information about footballers ' positive recreational drug tests has not been made public
@entity26 says there have been positive cases , but the information has not been disclosed
@entity147 , which carries out the tests , said it stopped publishing the information since the process fell outside its programme to detect performance - enhancing substances
the @entity26 did not realise the information was no *longer* made public
