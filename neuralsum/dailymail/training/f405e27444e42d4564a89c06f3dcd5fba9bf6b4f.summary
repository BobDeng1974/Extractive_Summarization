by @entity0 rumours were rife in a @entity3 town this week when a river running through turned bright red			1
the river in @entity7 , a small municipality on the border to the @entity9 , had changed colour over night and turned into ' blood '			1
police have been called in to investigate the matter , but it is believed to be a faulty filtering system from a slaughterhouse upstream			1
@entity17 : residents in the small town of @entity7 in @entity20 awoke to a river red as blood @entity23 , 65 , had gone for a morning walk when he saw the drastic change to the river which runs through the centre of the town			1
‘ i just could not believe my eyes , ’ he said			0
‘ the river was dark red			2
it was like something from a horror film			0
blood cascading through the centre of town			2
’ another local said : ‘ this is really creepy			0
yesterday evening i walked past here and it was its normal colour			0
‘ now it looks like someone slaughtered 1,000 virgins or something			0
i 'm not superstitious , and we 've never had any serial killers or anything like that here , but this is n't normal			0
' @entity50 of 1,00 virgins ' : locals feared the colour change was an result of mass murder or ' evil ' , although the most likely explanation is that of a broken filtration system at a nearby slaughterhouse @entity12 spokesman @entity59 said : ‘ we are checking the source of the blood and what caused it			1
‘ at the moment we are thinking it could have come from dead fish or maybe someone washed a barrel containing blood in the river			2
‘ it seems it came from the drains directly above the museum , ’ she said			0
the waste from a slaughterhouse higher up the @entity7 is usually pumped into a retaining pool where it is filtered before being released into the river .			1

@entity7 flowing through @entity3 village turns blood red
superstitious locals say the colour of the river is a sign of ' evil '
possibly caused by faulty filter at nearby slaughterhouse
