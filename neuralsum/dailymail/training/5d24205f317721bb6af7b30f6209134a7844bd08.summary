a frozen @entity0 , poisoned forests and paint sloughing off an empty swimming pool ; these are the remains of a city devastated by a nuclear disaster nearly 30 years ago			0
@entity8 in @entity9 , once home to a population of 50,000 , was just a few miles from the @entity11 power plant which exploded in 1986			1
now , a @entity13 - based documentary maker , @entity14 , has captured the area in decay by flying around the abandoned area using a camera attached to a drone			1
video below the footage shows @entity8 being taken over by nature			1
eerie views of rusted bumper cars and scattered papers are placed alongside golden flowers and trees growing among buildings			2
while many images have emerged of @entity8 since the disaster , this footage is the first to provide a drone 's - eye view of its abandoned remains			1
' @entity11 is one of the most interesting and dangerous places i 've been , ' mr @entity14 wrote			1
' the nuclear disaster , which happened in 1986 ( the year after i was born ) , had an effect on so many people , including my family when we lived in @entity42			2
eerie : a swimming pool slowly going to ruins after being abandoned decades ago			2
the explosion released 400 times more radiation than the @entity49 atomic bomb dropped over @entity50 ' i ca n't imagine how terrifying it would have been for the hundreds of thousands of locals who evacuated			0
' scientists are deeply divided on how many have died as a result of the explosion , which released about 400 times more radiation than the @entity49 atomic bomb dropped over @entity50			0
mr @entity14 filmed the footage , named ' postcards from @entity8 , @entity11 ' , while working on a ' @entity60 ' segment for @entity61 about the @entity62			1
it was captured using a @entity65 counter , a @entity66 , a @entity68 camera and a @entity69 +			1
abandoned : a frozen ferris wheel , poisoned forests and paint sloughing off an empty swimming pool ; these are the remains of city devastated by a nuclear disaster nearly 30 years ago @entity8 is now believed to be safe to visit for short periods as the isotopes released during the disaster have since decayed			1
' during my stay , i met so many amazing people , one of which was my guide @entity85 , also known as a ' stalker ' , ' said mr @entity14 ' we spent the week together exploring @entity11 and the nearby abandoned city of @entity8			1
there was something serene , yet highly disturbing about this place			1
the chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 april 1986 at the @entity94 in @entity9			2
an explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , which spread over much of the western @entity100 and @entity101			0
the chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and casualties , and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the @entity110			2
the battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated Â£ 11 billion ( $ 18 billion )			0
during the accident 31 people died , and long - term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for			0
' @entity120 has stood still and there are memories of past happenings floating around us			0
' the accident occurred during a systems test on april 26 , 1986 and created a huge explosion and fire which released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , spreading over western @entity100 and @entity101			0
@entity100 officials did not report the disaster for several days			0
even in the plant workers ' town of @entity8 , few knew what had happened when the plant 's no. 4 reactor blew up around 1.30am in the morning			1
disturbing : mr @entity14 filmed the footage , named ' postcards from @entity8 , @entity11 ' , while working on a ' @entity60 ' segment for @entity61 about the @entity62			1
the official acknowledgement came three days later and the government evacuated 350,000 residents from @entity11 and @entity8			1
an exclusion zone covering an area of more than 1,000sq miles around the abandoned plant was created to protect people from the effects of any lingering radiation			2
although tens of thousands of people evacuated the area , a few residents refused to leave			0
a handful of older residents moved back to be close to family graves			0
tourists may obtain day passes , and some workers who are rebuilding parts of the site are allowed in for limited hours only each month			0
scientists say the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years			0
futile : hundreds of abandoned gas masks can be seen inside a building in @entity8			2
although tens of thousands of people evacuated the area , a few residents refused to leave			0

@entity8 was just miles from the @entity11 plant which exploded in 1986
drone footage was captured by @entity13 - based *filmmaker* , @entity14
he used a @entity177 *quadcopter* , a @entity68 camera and a @entity69 +
it shows haunting views of abandoned *fairground* rides and buildings
' there was something serene yet disturbing about this place , ' said @entity14
