a @entity1 video showing a man taking five steps up a flow of lava on @entity6 in @entity7 has been analysed by a geoscientist who has confirmed it is possible to walk on lava			1
@entity11 , from @entity12 in @entity13 , has explained in his @entity14 that when boiling hot lava hits the cool air , it forms a dark crust that can be stood on - albeit for a short period of time			1
and although lava appears to flow like a stream , it is more viscous than water , which @entity11 claims means it can withstand a small amount of pressure			1
a @entity1 video showing a man walking across a flow of lava on @entity6 in @entity7 has been analysed by a geoscientist from @entity13			1
in a blog post , volcano expert @entity11 confirmed how this daredevil carried out the stunt - but strongly advised against anyone else giving it a go the word lava can be used to describe molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the rock that solidifies and cools after an eruption			1
when first erupted from a volcano , lava is a liquid and its temperature ranges from 700 to 1,200 ° @entity48 it is up to 100,000 times as viscous - thick and sticky - as water			2
a ' lava flow ' is when lava flows from a volcano and is created during a ' non-explosive effusive eruption			2
' when it has stopped moving , lava solidifies to form igneous rock			2
explosive eruptions create a mixture of volcanic ash and other fragments called tephra , rather than lava flows			2
during the 40 - second clip , a man - described in the video 's caption as a ' lava art craft worker ' - is shown running up a small channel of flowing lava			1
a colleague stands and watches from the sidelines			0
as the walker 's right foot takes his final step , a small flame is shown coming from the sole of his shoe			1
@entity11 claims that the walker 's foot probably ' combusted ' from the heat of the flow			2
in his blog , @entity11 said : ' taking a look at the video , the lava flow in question is moving pretty slow and has a dark crust on it			0
' this means it is likely pretty cool			0
' in fact , it looks like [ the lava ] is called " a'a lava " , which is even more viscous than the pahoehoe many people associate with lava flows			0
' crust forms quickly on lava flows because there is a high temperature gradient between the lava ( at ~ 1000 ° c ) and the air ( ~ @entity106 ) , so the lava hardens into a semi-flexible crust			0
during the 40 - second @entity1 clip , the man takes five or six steps up a flow of lava on @entity6			1
on his final step a flame appears under his right foot			1
@entity11 claims that this was the sole of the walker 's shoe combusting from the heat of the flow ' based on where the guys [ in the video ] are standing , the lava flow is n’t likely very large because the guy who does n’t run up the flow does n’t seem concerned to be standing only a few feet away			1
' the flow itself looks confined to a small channel surrounded by solidified lava			0
my guess is that this little flow is fairly far from the vent ( source )			0
' @entity11 continues that if a lava flow has a ' decent ' crust , if it is moving slowly and if the walker moves fast enough , their weight is n't enough to make them sink into the flow			0
yet he warns that if the crust is uneven or thinner in certain parts the walker could end up falling into the lava			0
there are two main types of lava - pahoehoe and a'a			2
@entity152 is @entity153 for ' smooth , unbroken lava '			0
and is shown in the centre of this image			0
@entity157 is @entity153 for ' stony rough lava '			0
it flows slower and cools quicker			0
this lava is shown on the right - hand side of the image and is the lava @entity164 thinks is in the ' @entity166 ' video in a previous blog post , @entity164 explained that falling into lava would cause the water inside a human body to boil , turn to steam and the person would ' explode from within			1
' commenting further on the ' lava man ' video , @entity164 said : ' apparently this video was taken by ' lava artists ' during some recent activity at @entity178			2
@entity179 flows from @entity6 can travel far downslope in channels , forming thick crusts that could support a person - as they did here			1
' running up a lava flow is possible without much in the way of dire consequences if you ( a ) pick the right lava flow - cool and slow ; ( b ) you step lively and ( c ) get lucky			1
' this hobby is up there with base jumping from tall buildings and surfing a volcano in terms of smart ways to spend your time , but really , lava flows are some of the least dangerous of the hazards from a volcano			0

the 40 - second @entity1 clip shows a man running up a stream of lava on @entity6 in @entity7
during his final step , a flame appears under his right foot as the sole of his shoe combusts
a geoscientist has studied the clip and explained exactly how the daredevil carried out the stunt - but strongly advises against trying
