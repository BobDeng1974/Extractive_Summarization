by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:14 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 09:44 est , 12 december 2013 the gap between what men and women earn in work has widened for the first time in five years , new figures show			1
full - time men now earn 10 per cent more than their female colleagues , but including all employees the gap has risen 19.6 per cent to 19.7 per cent			1
unions seized on the figures as proof that years of ‘ slow , steady progress ’ on pay equality was being eroded			1
working women receive £ 97 - a - week less than men in full - time jobs , the @entity19 said the @entity19 said it was the first time the gender pay gap has increased since 2008			1
the figures showed that median annual earnings for full - time employees were £ 27,000 in the year to april , an increase of 2.1 per cent from the previous year			1
one in 10 full - time workers earned less than £ 7.28 an hour , while 10 per cent earned more than £ 27 an hour , both figures increasing by 1.5 per cent over the year			1
weekly pay was highest in @entity31 at £ 658 , and lowest in @entity32 at £ 460			0
full - time pay for men increased by 1.8 per cent to £ 556 a week and went up by 2.2 per cent for women to £ 459			1
working mothers are seen as ‘ scatty clock - watchers ’ who are given a bad name by out - of - date sitcoms , a @entity37 frontbencher has warned			2
@entity43 said attitudes had to change because the days of dad working while mum ' stays at home bringing up the kids ' are long gone			0
the shadow childcare minister said she wanted to ‘ bust the myth ’ of working parents as unreliable employees			0
miss @entity43 , who recently returned to @entity53 from maternity leave , called for a revolution in the way employers and colleagues view working parents			0
and she complained that the depiction of mothers on television has not changed since the 1970s , when the sitcom @entity64 featured the frustrated , culinary - challenged housewife @entity65 , played by @entity66			0
mothers are wrongly seen as unfocussed employees who take too much time off while fathers have requests for leave rejected , she said			0
in her first speech since taking the role in @entity76 ’s reshuffle , she said society must value the contribution parents make in the workplace			0
she added : ' far from being scatty and clock - watching , working mums have done a day ’s work before they leave the house - we do n’t waste a minute of our day			2
’ the @entity86 said its analysis of the data based on mean , or average , figures showed that the gender pay gap was 15.7 per cent			2
@entity86 general secretary @entity91 said : ‘ years of a slow , steady progress on closing the gender pay gap has gone into reverse			1
ministers should be ashamed of presiding over this latest dismal record on pay			0
‘ it is not right that in @entity99 today women still earn 15 per cent less per hour than men , a pay gap that costs full - time women over £ 5,000 a year			1
‘ the light - touch , voluntary approach to tackling gender pay inequality is clearly failing			2
' we need tougher action to force companies to look at their pay gaps , while government can lead the way by making all new jobs available on a part - time or flexible basis			1
’ the @entity86 said the real value of the average full - time wage fell by more than £ 200 over the last year , and by nearly £ 2,000 since 2010			1
@entity117 of the @entity118 said the widening gender pay gap ‘ is a damming indictment of the government 's record when it comes to women 's standing in the economy ’			2
@entity37 ’s shadow women ’s minister @entity127 said : ‘ after falling under @entity37 , this morning we learn that the gender pay gap is back on the increase and no progress has been made in three years of this government			1
‘ women are bearing the brunt of the cost of living crisis and today confirms that decades of progress on women ’s equality are being undermined by a government that just does n’t get it when it comes to women			0
’ however chancellor @entity140 said it was ‘ interesting ’ that the @entity19 figures showed the increase in average earnings keeping pace with inflation			2
he told the @entity147 : ‘ it shows that median gross weekly earnings are increasing at 2.2 per cent			0
' that is , of course , the current rate of inflation			0
‘ so i think that points to the broader argument that i have been making , which is that as the economy recovers , that is the route to a sustained increase in the living standards of the people who live in that economy , and you ca n't pretend that the two are n't connected , that you can have a living standards plan without an economy plan			0

men working full - time earn 10 ***%*** more than women , up from *9.5* ***%***
gap for all workers including part - time rises to 19.7 ***%***
unions say steady progress cutting pay gap has been eroded
chancellor @entity140 says wages now rising in line with inflation
