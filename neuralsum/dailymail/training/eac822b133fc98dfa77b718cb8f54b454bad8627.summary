@entity2 scientists are one step closer from turning water and sunlight into an efficient supply of hydrogen - based fuel , new research has found			1
an @entity10 team has successfully replicated a protein , which captures energy from sunlight in order to create biological systems , the same way plants do			1
researchers found the protein had displayed ' electrical heartbeat ' , which is the key to photosynthesis - a process used by plants to convert sunlight into oxygen and energy used to power their systems			1
' ' it is an exciting prospect to use them to create hydrogen , and do it cheaply and safely , ' dr @entity26 said			2
the study found hydrogen offers potential as a zero - carbon replacement for petroleum products , and is already used for launching space craft			1
however , until this work , the way that plants produce hydrogen by splitting water has been poorly understood			2
' the system uses a naturally - occurring protein and does not need batteries or expensive metals , meaning it could be affordable in developing countries , ' dr @entity26 said			1
the way of the future : @entity2 scientists are one step closer from turning water and sunlight into cheap fuel co-researcher professor @entity27 said the research opened up new possibilities for manufacturing hydrogen as a cheap and clean source of fuel			1
' this is the first time we have replicated the primary capture of energy from sunlight , ' professor @entity27 said			0
' it ’s the beginning of a whole suite of possibilities , such as creating a highly efficient fuel , or to trapping atmospheric carbon			0
' professor @entity27 said large amounts of hydrogen fuel produced by artificial photosynthesis could transform the economy			2
' that carbon - free cycle is essentially indefinitely sustainable			0
@entity88 is extraordinarily abundant , water is everywhere – the raw materials we need to make the fuel			0
and at the end of the usage cycle it goes back to water , ' he said			0
the team found the protein had displayed ' electrical heartbeat ' after sunlight exposure that is the key to photosynthesis scientists used a protein called ferritin , which is usually found in almost all living organisms and often stores iron but the team removed the iron and replaced it with the abundant metal , manganese , to closely resemble the water splitting site in photosynthesis			1
the researchers also replaced the protein with a light - sensitive pigment , @entity113			2
when scientists shone light onto the modified ferritin , there was a clear indication of charge transfer just like in natural photosynthesis			0
the possibilities inspired visionary researcher associate professor @entity121 , who led the research group until his death from brain cancer , earlier this year			0
' associate professor @entity121 imagined modifying @entity126 so that it expresses the gene to create ready - made artificial photosynthetic proteins			0
it would be a self - replicating system – all you need to do is shine light on it , ' dr @entity26 said .			1

@entity2 scientists have successfully replicated one of the crucial steps in photosynthesis
scientists hope the research will open up new possibilities for manufacturing hydrogen as a cheap and clean source of fuel
researchers found the protein had displayed ' electrical heartbeat ' after being exposed to the sun , the same way plants do
dr @entity26 said : ' the system uses a naturally - occurring protein and does not need batteries or expensive metals
hydrogen offers potential as a replacement for petrol , but until now , the way in which plants produced hydrogen was poorly understood
