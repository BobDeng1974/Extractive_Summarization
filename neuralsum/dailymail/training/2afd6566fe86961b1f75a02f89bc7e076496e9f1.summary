@entity0 got back to winning ways in the @entity2 thanks to strikes from @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity7 's men also maintained their unbeaten record at @entity9 as they ground out a scrappy win over a @entity12 outfit that were forced to play the last 30 minutes of the game with 10 men after @entity16 's dismissal for a knee - high lunge on @entity18			1
@entity19 rates the players ' performances at @entity22			0
@entity5 ( centre ) is mobbed his his team - mates after scoring his side 's second goal at @entity9 @entity0 @entity27 - 7 desperate to show he can still compete at the highest level and looked comfortable throughout the game in his first league start of the season			1
@entity33 - 7.5 never really tested and looked more dangerous with his bursting runs down the right hand side			2
almost got his name on the scoresheet with a powerful shot which flew just over the bar			0
@entity42 - 6 relieved to see @entity43 only pull out a yellow card following his late challenge on @entity46 in the first half which the @entity12 players were furious with			2
caused another stir early in the second half when he appeared to dive inside the box and was lucky to stay on the field			0
@entity0 centre back @entity42 ( left ) was lucky to just see yellow for his challenge on @entity12 's @entity46 @entity58 - 8 @entity59 looked in control against @entity61 and showed once again why he is still one of the best defenders in the @entity2 with another commanding display			1
@entity7 will be praying he can stay fit to keep his side at the top of the table			0
@entity18 - 7 fortunate to escape a serious injury following @entity16 's nasty challenge in the second half which led to his dismissal			1
never put a foot wrong and will be hoping to keep his place in the team			0
@entity76 - 7 with @entity77 serving a suspension , @entity76 had a chance to show @entity7 why he should be a first - team regular and forged a good partnership with @entity82 at the heart of the midfield			0
@entity82 - 8 has been one of @entity0 's best players this season and showed once again why he is so influential for the west @entity89 club with a powerful performance and broke up a lot of @entity12 's attacking play			1
@entity0 midfielder @entity93 collapses under the challenge of @entity12 defender @entity95 @entity93 - 7.5 the @entity97 forward infuriated the @entity12 dugout when he dived following a challenge with @entity95 and received an immediate yellow card from @entity43 was taken off midway through the second half			1
@entity102 - 8 showed his intelligence once again to pick out a wonder cross which fell perfectly for hazard to open the scoring			2
@entity4 - 9 he might not be the tallest in the @entity0 team but the talented forward showed his aerial skills by planting the perfect header past @entity112 for the opening goal and produced a piece of magic to set up the second goal for @entity5			1
@entity117 performer for the home side			1
@entity12 goalkeeper @entity112 can only look on as @entity4 ( left ) nets the opener for @entity0 @entity5 - 8 the @entity121 forward ended his short goal drought after going four games without a goal with the crucial second			1
it was a shame that his performance was marred by a needless dive under a challenge from @entity16 which earned him a yellow card			0
subs : @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 ( for @entity76 82 ) , @entity135 ( for @entity102 78 ) , @entity136 ( for @entity93 ) , @entity137 , @entity138 scorers : hazard 7 , @entity5 68 booked : @entity42 , @entity93 , @entity5 @entity12 @entity112 - 7 could do nothing to prevent goals from @entity4 and @entity5 and always knew he was going to face a difficult afternoon against the league leaders			1
@entity144 - 6 lucky not to give away a penalty in the second half when his arm appeared to strike a cross from @entity93 but referee @entity150 failed to award a spot kick			0
@entity59 had a major task on his hand trying to keep the @entity0 forwards at bay			0
@entity12 's @entity144 ( left ) puts in a strong challenge on @entity0 forward @entity102 @entity158 - 6 nightmare return for @entity158 to @entity89 who only lasted nine minutes after picking up an early injury and was replaced by @entity162 after just ten minutes			1
@entity95 - 6 the afternoon was always going to be more difficult when he lost his defensive partner @entity158 so early in the game and failed to recover			0
could do nothing to stop the @entity0 goals and did his best to keep the scoreline to just two goals			0
@entity171 - 5 disappointing display from @entity171 who failed to cause any kinds of problems for the @entity0 defence and was always restricted with his attacking play as he tried to keep the likes of @entity93 and hazard at bay			1
@entity171 ( right ) put in a disappointing display for @entity12 at @entity9 @entity182 - 6 blew a golden chance to get his side back into the game at the start of the second half when he drilled a low shot which flew inches past the post			1
@entity16 - 4 did his team no favours when he was shown a red card in the second half for a high tackle on @entity18			2
after being booked earlier in the game you wonder why he produced a studs up challenge on the @entity0 full - back			2
@entity201 - 5 received a needless booking in the first half when he stuck out his arm to try and turn the ball home from a @entity12 corner even though the cross was past him			2
had to be on his guard for the rest of the game which probably affected his performance			0
@entity16 ( right ) leaves the field after his sending off for a reckless challenge on @entity217 @entity218 - 6 frustrating afternoon for the @entity12 defender who did his best to keep @entity102 at bay but found things even harder when his team were reduced to ten - men			1
@entity61 - 5 @entity223 would have been hoping to see @entity61 have more impact on the game but he failed to cause any problems at all for @entity58 and @entity42 and was taken off in the second half			0
needs to show a lot more in the coming weeks			0
@entity46 - 5 just like @entity61 , @entity46 did nothing to trouble the @entity0 defence and was also substituted			2
must fear for his place in the starting line - up			0
@entity61 ( right ) had a quiet afternoon and failed to cause @entity42 ( left ) and @entity58 any problems subs : @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity162 ( for @entity239 ) , @entity240 , @entity241 ( for @entity242 ) , @entity243 74 ) , @entity244 booked : @entity16 , @entity201 , @entity245 , @entity162 sent off : @entity16 referee : @entity43			0

@entity4 scored a rare header to put @entity0 ahead in the sixth minute
hazard set up up @entity5 for the home side 's second
@entity5 ended his four - game goal drought
@entity12 's @entity16 for sent off on the hour mark
