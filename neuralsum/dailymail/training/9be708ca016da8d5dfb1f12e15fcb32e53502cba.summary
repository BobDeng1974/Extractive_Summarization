by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 10:02 est , 27 july 2012 fashion forward : @entity2 have unveiled their new logo to accompany their rebranding as @entity2 as an exercise in rebranding it has not gone exactly according to plan			1
and disgruntled fans of @entity2 have not been afraid to let the luxury brand know just how upset they are			1
@entity10 users have taken to the social networking site to express their displeasure at @entity2 's new packaging logo since the company rebranded their ready - to - wear collection as @entity2			1
the new packaging - simple white block font lettering reading @entity2 on top of a black background ' has ruffled some online feathers , with @entity10 users slamming the design as ' boring ' , ' disrespectful ' and ' a cheap knock - off '			1
the luxury brand 's new creative director @entity23 decided on the makeover , swapping the company 's iconic monochrome logo of interlocking @entity2 letters ( that has been around for more than half a century ) with the fresh look			1
and although the famous signature will remain unaltered on handbags , lipsticks and shoes , there is no certainty that it will continue to be used as widely			2
disparaging comments on @entity2 's facebook page include those from @entity39 ( ' bad , bad , @entity41			1
reminds me of the change to @entity44 to dior ... it takes from the integrity of the original creator and what the fans are used to ! ! ' ) , and @entity50 : ' @entity51 ! @entity52 must stay in the logo ! ! ! ! the color and fonts are great but you are killing an iconic brand by excluding @entity58			2
' elegant or boring ? @entity2 's new ready - to - wear logo has not pleased the brand 's @entity10 fans classic lines : @entity2 's interlocking lettering has always been popular others remark that the new image is ' boring ' , ' confusing ' , ' too @entity66 ' , ' ridiculously stupid ' , ' senseless ' and ' disrespectful to @entity67 '			1
there are fans , however , who disagree with the mass displeasure , expressing their admiration for the new design			0
with one user commenting : ' love ! @entity52 would be proud ' and another describing it as ' simplicity and elegant			0
' one user comments that the new logo is set to be ' the @entity78 of the fashion world ' because of its ability to divide opinion			0
facebook fury : @entity2 fans have taken to the social networking site to comment on the brand 's new logo @entity2 was founded by designer @entity2 and his partner , @entity88 in 1962 , and the current logo was created by the graphic designer @entity90			1
over the years it has become as recognisable as @entity93 's interlocked cs or @entity94 's @entity94 and the recent announcement that @entity67 would be eliminated has provoked outcry from a number of commentators			0
' it 's like when they changed @entity105 to @entity105 only 10 times worse , ' @entity103 vintage clothing store @entity101 , while style website @entity99 stated the new name ' sounds like a chain of downmarket budget hotels '			0
paying tribute : the new house logo bears a strong similarity to the label 's original branding from 1966 however a spokesperson for @entity23 said he was drawing inspiration from 1966 , when the ready - to - wear line was launched as @entity118			0
earlier this month it was announced that he would be moving the @entity122 label 's design studio from @entity123 to his adoptive city of @entity125			0
while fittings would still in @entity123 and @entity2 ateliers will continue to work from the label 's @entity129 offices			2
@entity23 relocated to @entity125 in 2007 after he left @entity131 to concentrate on art and photography			0
while it is traditional for creative directors of @entity122 houses to live in @entity123 , @entity23 follows in the footsteps of @entity138 , who leads @entity123 - based @entity139 from @entity140			0
@entity2 died in 2008 and produced the label 's last haute couture collection in 2002			2
