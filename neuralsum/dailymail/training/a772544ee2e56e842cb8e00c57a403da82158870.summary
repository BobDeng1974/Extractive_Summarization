five fractures : retired teacher @entity1 suffered several broken bones before she was diagnosed with osteoporosis @entity1 was lifting her bicycle into the boot of her car when she felt her back crack			1
' i 've always been fit so it never occurred to me that i 'd broken a bone , i thought i 'd pulled a muscle , ' says the retired teacher from @entity12			0
she was 61 at the time			1
' i was disappointed to have to postpone my bike ride - and could n't believe i was still in agony days later			0
' but it was n't a pulled muscle - @entity1 had fractured a vertebra in her spine			0
she was suffering from osteoporosis , characterised by ' fragility ' fractures in the bone			1
these fractures occur most commonly in the wrist , spine or hip , and are often unexpected , coming after a minor bump or a fall from standing height			1
but , unfortunately @entity1 did n't learn this until it was too late			0
instead , a week afterwards , @entity1 went to her gp and asked for an investigation			0
' he said there was no need and did n't do even a cursory examination , ' she says			0
he sent her home and told her to take painkillers and touch her toes every morning			0
incredibly , it took eight years - and four more spinal fractures - before she was finally referred for a @entity42 ( dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) scan to check her bone density			1
the fifth fracture happened when she missed her footing stepping off a boat and fell on her backside			1
' one of the other fractures was after picking up shopping , another just pushing a trolley along , ' says @entity1			2
' each time i suffered weeks of pain			2
and each time i went to the doctor but was told there was no problem and it would get better on its own			1
' during that period my younger sister had been diagnosed with severe osteoporosis , but even though i explained all this to the doctor , he insisted that there was nothing seriously wrong with me			0
' i was in such pain with the final fracture that i kept going back to the surgery and on the third visit , i saw a new doctor who referred me to hospital , ' she recalls			1
' the @entity42 scan was sufficiently worrying for me to be sent for an @entity75 scan a few days later and the resulting image clearly showed the five spinal fractures i 'd suffered			2
it brought back some unpleasant memories , i can tell you			0
' her experience is horribly common			0
around 2.3 million people in the @entity84 , mainly women over 50 , have osteoporosis			1
the cause can be genetic , hormonal or result from lifestyle factors such as smoking , drinking or having a low body mass index ( @entity91 ) - being too light means the bones are n't stressed enough to produce new bone cells			0
porous : what happens to the bone when affected by osteoporosis medications such as steroids , and digestive disorders such as coeliac disease ( which affect the absorption of nutrients ) can cause osteoporosis in younger people			2
and while broken wrists and backs mend relatively easily , the true hazard of osteoporosis is the huge increased risk of hip fracture - every year in @entity84 it leads to 89,000 broken hips , which can often prove fatal			1
' hip fracture is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of premature death - with one in four people dying within a year of breaking their hip and thousands more becoming dependent on carers and services , ' says dr @entity121 , associate director for falls and bone health at the @entity124			1
' that 's why anyone over 50 who suffers a fragility fracture should be tested for osteoporosis and given correct treatment			1
' yet many doctors still regard increased risk of fracture as a normal part of ageing , like wrinkles or grey hair			1
a report from the @entity138 revealed sufferers endure three fractures on average before diagnosis - with one in five having another fracture within a year of their first			1
experts agree that the key to tackling this is @entity148 , linked to a hospital 's @entity149 - or in a fracture clinic or community clinic staffed by @entity153			1
' these patients might as well have signs on their foreheads saying : “ i 've got osteoporosis			0
do something ! ” yet they are sent home with reassuring noises			0
' where these services are in place , hip fracture rates are being reduced by around 3 per cent a year ( bucking the trend throughout most of @entity84 , where hip fractures are increasing by around 1.5 per cent year on year )			1
in 2009 , the @entity168 called for a fracture liaison service to be available for ' every local population '			2
yet worrying evidence from the @entity124 shows that four years later , only one in three local health authorities has a designated fracture liaison service			2
further , @entity153 as well as hospital doctors are still ' failing to instigate conversations about bone health with those at risk , ' says the @entity138			1
' it 's staggering that one in two hip fractures are preceded by at least one previous fracture , ' says @entity184 , gp and clinical champion for osteoporosis at the @entity188			1
there should be widespread alarm that so many patients presenting with a fragility fracture are sent home without a @entity42 scan , adds dr @entity195 , a @entity196 who helped write the national guidelines on osteoporosis			2
' these patients might as well have signs on their foreheads saying : “ i 've got osteoporosis			0
do something ! ” yet they are sent home with reassuring noises			0
' the failure is almost always organisational , says dr @entity121			1
' if there 's no system in place for good communication between hospital and general practice to identify who takes responsibility for following up fragility fractures , you ca n't expect individual doctors to initiate this essential assessment			1
' perhaps equally significant is the problem of getting the right treatment for patients - and ensuring people with the disease understand the importance of taking the medication			1
debilitating effect : a new report reveals that sufferers of the condition endure three fractures on average before their osteoporosis is diagnosed the mid-nineties saw the launch of the first highly - effective drugs , known as bisphosphonates , which have been shown to halve the risk of a further fracture			1
yet as with many long - term diseases where there are no ' scary ' symptoms to jolt patients into taking a daily pill , many do n't take their osteoporosis medication			0
motivation is even more of a problem with bisphosphonates , as it can take up to two years before bone density is seen to improve			2
by then , four out of five patients have stopped taking their medication - within the first year , according to some studies			0
a further complication is evidence that bisphosphonates can - in rare circumstances - cause a slight increase in an unusual type of hip fracture after five to ten years of continuous use			1
' we now know that some patients need a “ drug holiday ” of one to two years after taking medication for around five years , ' says professor @entity267 , chair of the @entity268			0
fracture liaison services can help by providing specialists to motivate patients to stick with long - term drug therapy and make lifestyle changes such as taking up weight - bearing exercise - as well as monitoring bone density in case a drug holiday is needed			2
@entity1 's story shows the value of such a regimen			2
since her diagnosis in 2011 , she 's been taking bisphosophonates along with vitamin d and calcium , and doing regular pilates			1
her bone density increased by 12 per cent in just one year , although her bones are still weaker than they should be			0
the @entity138 is now appealing to patients to take responsibility for their own care by insisting on getting fragility fractures adequately treated and asking their doctor about a bone check			2
' when people are aware they have the condition , more steps can be taken to reduce unnecessary fractures , ' says the society 's director @entity299			1
@entity1 wishes such advice had been available ten years ago			0
' i used to be able to walk 14 miles a day			0
but i 've been in constant pain since the last fracture , despite two operations			2
now i struggle to walk four miles			0
in any case i have to be careful all the time and i have to leave the heavy lifting to my partner			0
' i watch my best friend , who is the same age as me , out climbing mountains in @entity313			0
we used to match each other and it 's changed my life knowing i can no longer join her			0
it means my social life has narrowed and it 's not fair			0

around 2.3m people in the @entity84 , mainly women over 50 , have the condition
it leads to a huge risk of hip fracture , which is often fatal
sufferers endure three fractures on average before diagnosis
the failure to correctly identify the problem in time is mainly organisational
experts say there 's no system in place for good communication between hospital and general practise
