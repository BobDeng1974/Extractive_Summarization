the @entity13 bracelet reads and monitors the wearer 's cardiac rhythm , which is as unique as a person 's fingerprint , to authenticate who they are			1
a built - in proximity sensor can then detect where they are , and when the wearer is close to a paired computer , device or car , will automatically confirm their identity and unlock the required hardware or software			1
the bracelet can then be used to unlock paired computers and mobile devices and cars , for example when the wearer clasps the @entity32 around their wrist , the bracelet powers on			1
by placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor , it completes an electrical circuit			0
@entity13 will then vibrate and built - in leds light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them when the wearer clasps the @entity32 around their wrist , the bracelet powers on			1

@entity13 will then vibrate and built - in leds light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them			1
users will stay authenticated until they remove their @entity13 and the electrical circuit is broke			2
the @entity32 functions on a 3 - factor security system - the bracelent , a unique heartbeat and an @entity70 ( @entity70 ) , which is a smartphone or device registered with the app. although other companies are also working on password replacements that use a person 's biometric data such as an iris , face , or fingerprint , for example , @entity31 founder , dr. @entity74 , claims @entity13 is even more secure			1
he told @entity83 : ' your face , your iris — they 're all physical features that can be stolen , that you leave everywhere			0
' the bracelet contains a @entity89 that measures the amount of electrical power generated by a human heart , called a cardiac rhythm tracked on an electrocardiogram , or @entity95			2
this @entity95 differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart			0
@entity13 only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm , meaning if the bracelet is stolen it ca n't be hacked			1
and unlike photos of people 's faces and iris , or fingerprints left on surfaces , a heart ca n't be copied or stolen			0
along with the @entity89 and proximity sensors , the @entity32 bracelet also has a motion sensor and connects to devices using @entity116			1
the motion sensor can be used to open car boots or doors wirelessly by moving the wrist in a certain direction , for example			2
applications on smart @entity123 can also be controlled using flicks and spins of the wrist			0
plus , @entity32 can be used to pay for shopping wirelessly and securely			1
although the first @entity32 release is a bracelet , @entity74 claims that the technology could also be embedded into other accessories , such as a ring or belt - all the device needs is a connection that can be undone			2
along with the @entity89 and proximity sensor , the @entity32 bracelet also has a motion sensor and connects to devices using @entity116			1
the motion sensor can be used to open car boots or doors as well as used to control certain applications on smart tvs , pictured the bracelet only works with paired devices and once it has been joined to a smartphone , for example , it can vibrate and respond to notifications on the device such as a new email or text message			1
