i spent three days this week with @entity1 , one of the @entity3 hostages who was held captive by @entity4 in @entity5 for ten months			1
he was released last year , a short time before his @entity7 and @entity8 co-captives were beheaded one by one in a series of gruesome videos			1
he was among the last people to see them alive			1
we conducted a question and answer session at the @entity16			2
in addition , over a series of coffees and walks around @entity20 , @entity1 , a charming and good - humored but rather shy young man of 30 , slowly provided additional insights into his time in captivity - his first interview with a @entity27 @entity26 down for video released @entity3 hostage @entity1 ( far right ) arrives back in @entity3 with fellow journalists @entity31 ( far left ) , @entity32 ( second from left ) and @entity33 ( second from left ) after being released after 10 months of captivity in @entity5 he was part of a group of hostages who passed their time by playing chess on card ripped from discarded milk cartons @entity3 president @entity42 greets @entity1 on his arrival back in @entity3 from @entity5 ' we were moved around a lot , kept underground most of the time , sometimes chained together for weeks on end , ' said @entity1			1
' it was tough and terrible things happened , but we also kept ourselves in as good spirits as possible			2
' we passed the time by inventing quizzes which we played with each other			2
we created chess pieces out of a discarded milk carton we had			1
' our captors let us play but were angered when we represented some of the pieces by faces - their interpretation of @entity62 strictly forbids any depictions of any man or animal			2
so we had to make the pieces again			2
' @entity1 , speaking in @entity66 , said that during his 10 months of captivity he learned @entity66 from the @entity8 and @entity7 hostages he was held with : @entity8 aid workers @entity70 and @entity71 , freelance journalist @entity72 , @entity7 journalists @entity73 and @entity75 and aid worker @entity76			1
the others have been killed			0
' we were not given access to tv , computers or the internet - but they did sometimes give us books , but mainly books propagating @entity62 thought			0
they also brought us videos to watch , videos that tried to persuade us that the caliphate was god 's will			0
' @entity1 added that he and fellow @entity3 hostage @entity33 used the time in captivity to write a children 's story in their head , and that book , titled @entity98 rentrera - t - il à la maison ? - @entity99 come back home ? - will be published in @entity3 next month			1
@entity1 did the illustrations for the book , which i suppose also served as a kind of therapy for him			2
he is a very gifted illustrator and drew me a beautiful full - page picture , which he said represented all the human rights activists at the @entity16 , on the copy of the book he gave me			1
he speaks fondly of his fellow hostages			2
@entity1 was imprisoned with @entity8 hostages @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) for months while they were held by @entity4 he shared captivity with @entity7 aid worker @entity76 ( left ) and journalist @entity75 ( right ) , both of whom were beheaded freelance journalist @entity116 ( left ) was described as ' very sociable ' by @entity1			1
@entity8 photographer @entity72 ( right ) - who was abducted in november 2012 - is still being held in @entity5 ' @entity117 was very clever , and had deep political knowledge			1
and he was very brave			0
he was not afraid of to answer back to our captors			0
he used to challenge them with what he saw as inconsistencies in their teaching and worldview			0
he also , i should add , won all the games of chess			2
' he managed to conceal the fact from everyone that he was @entity131 and had lived in @entity132			0
none of us had any idea and i only found out from press reports after he was killed			0
' @entity4 supporters tend to be extremely anti-semitic and had they known @entity75 was @entity131 , he would probably have been subject to additional torture			2
@entity1 also confirmed what fellow hostage @entity33 already told the @entity3 media , that @entity142 - the @entity3 @entity143 on trial in @entity145 for the murder of four @entity131 at the @entity148 @entity147 last year - was the same man who had been one of his captors in @entity5			1
@entity150 has added that @entity142 was responsible for torturing them too			0
@entity1 does n't want to go into detail about the mistreatment the @entity4 prisoners received and prefers to concentrate on the more agreeable details , to make sure they are not only remembered as victims of what are in effect perhaps the most sadistic snuff videos ever posted on the @entity160			1
the @entity3 hostage was held by @entity163 's terror gang			2
in january , the group demanded ransom payments for @entity166 and @entity167 , from @entity168 @entity170 man @entity169 ( pictured as a primary school pupil ) was yesterday revealed to be the world 's most wanted man , @entity163 but he did confirm to me that ' at least 10 @entity3 and @entity145 citizens ' were among their captors			0
he also hinted that the @entity8 and @entity7 prisoners were ' supervised ' by a group of @entity8 and other fluent @entity66 - speaking @entity4 members			1
' @entity70 was in many ways the most simple and innocent guy you can imagine			0
being a taxi driver he was more down - to - earth , not like the experienced travellers that some of the journalists being held hostages were			2
' he had a huge heart			0
it was sometimes hard to understand his heavy @entity192 accent			0
but his jokes and humour came through			0
' it 's cool to be with him , ' one of the other @entity197 hostages said to me at the time			2
even though we were being moved around in locations in the middle of the desert he liked to speak of his beloved hobby of fishing			0
he was crazy about it			0
i think he taught me every word connected with fishing in the @entity66 vocabulary			0
' @entity71 was more introvert			0
he thought very carefully before he said anything			0
@entity76 had been disappointed by some of the things he had seen when he served in the @entity7 army and so much wanted to help @entity5			1
' @entity73 was very sociable			0
if the @entity197 hostages had arguments , he used to calm us all down			2
in a way he was the most respected of us all			0
he had a big soul			0
' @entity1 also spent time with @entity7 aid worker @entity221 , who @entity4 says was accidentally killed last month in a @entity223 airstrike , but said that most of the time , as a woman , she was kept separate from the men			1
@entity4 fighters parade through @entity227 , where the terror network film many propaganda videos together with the three other @entity3 hostages , @entity1 was released last summer , for a reported ransom of several million euros - though the @entity3 government has denied they had anything to do with this			1
' we were given 24 hours notice before we were freed			0
this gave time for the other hostages to give me messages to pass to their families			1
we were not allowed to take any paper with us but i memorised the email and phone numbers of their relatives			0
' @entity1 has subsequently had phone and @entity248 conversations with the relatives of some of the hostages and @entity73 's mother flew from the @entity7 to @entity253 to meet with him			1
@entity1 also indicates that terrible things were done to them , and sometimes there were sharp disagreements between the hostages , but out of respect for those who were beheaded and for the sake of their families , he says he will never make public some of the disagreements or sufferings			1
' it would be the decision of the families if they one day want to reveal details of the messages i passed on to them or what was done to them in captivity			0
' @entity1 is also wary of saying anything publically that could make life harder for @entity72 , who remains an @entity4 prisoner and who is now being used by @entity4 to film a series of propaganda reports from the de facto capital of the @entity281 , @entity227			1
@entity1 now speaks a relatively fluent @entity66 – a language he barely understood before his captivity			2
' i learned @entity66 from the @entity8 and @entity7 hostages			1
even though there were 23 of us in total from several different countries , @entity66 was the main language we all spoke together			0
' @entity4 yesterday executed four men they accused of being spies in the @entity293 of @entity294 for various security reasons , few details have been made public about other released hostages from @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 and elsewhere			1
the other @entity197 hostages were all released , apart from a @entity305 who was executed by @entity4 at the time @entity1 was being held there			1
' it is not for me to judge whether the @entity7 and @entity8 governments should have paid a ransom for their hostages			1
i would only say that the @entity7 is spending a lot more money on outside intelligence than any @entity197 government and they did not do the job to get their hostages out			1
' more should have been done , although it is not for me to say how			0
' @entity1 also wanted to point out that he spent time with the locals in @entity227 in the immediate period before his abduction and ' the population of @entity227 was not at all supportive of @entity4 and there were many demonstrations against @entity4 there			1
' he was concerned that the people of @entity227 now have to live not only under the terror of @entity4 rule but under the fear of @entity7 and allied airstrikes			1
' it is them i am also thinking of , ' he says .			0

@entity1 was held captive in @entity5 for ten months by @entity4 militants
he was one of the last people to see executed hostages alive
kept chained together for long periods with other abused hostages
made secret chess sets out of discarded milk cartons to pass the time
@entity344 and @entity7 should have done more to help rescue those held
