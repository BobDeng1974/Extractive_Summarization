@entity0 and @entity2 's @entity1 remain neck and neck , despite the @entity5 being ahead in the polls tomorrow the @entity7 dissolves @entity8 and the election campaign begins			1
it will be the strangest election of modern times and leaves the experts baffled			1
most expected that , with economic recovery , and @entity2 ahead of @entity14 in the polls as favoured prime minister , the @entity1 would pull ahead			1
labour and the @entity1 remain neck and neck			1
only a fool , or a social scientist , would predict the outcome			2
the two major parties now attract a diminishing share of voters – about two in three in 2010 compared with more than 96 per cent in 1951			2
voters have a wider choice than ever before			2
in @entity28 , they can opt for three other alternatives – not just the @entity30 , but also @entity31 and the @entity32 – all of whom score more than five per cent in the polls			2
in @entity37 and @entity38 , there is a further alternative – the @entity40			2
the weakening of the two party system makes a hung @entity8 very likely			1
but , curiously , a small overall majority for the @entity1 or @entity0 could prove even more unstable than a hung parliament			1
the @entity1 would be at the mercy of their eurosceptic right wing , as @entity47 was in 1992			1
he had a majority of just 21 , and used to say that he was at the mercy of 13 of them who were quite mad			2
they made his life a misery when he sought to ratify the @entity55 reforming the @entity56			2
a @entity0 government with a small majority would be at the mercy of its left wing which opposes austerity			1
@entity0 , contrary to @entity64 propaganda , is committed not to a splurge in public spending , but to public expenditure cuts , though less severe than @entity2 and @entity62 are proposing			1
but @entity0 austerity would disappoint the expectations of its supporters , many of whom look for rapid improvements in the @entity74 and social care			1
speaking two weeks ago at the @entity76 , @entity77 , the @entity79 leader , advised @entity28 voters to support the @entity32 or what she called ‘ progressive ’ @entity0 candidates , that is candidates opposed to austerity			1
she hopes to create an anti-austerity bloc in the next @entity8 , composed of the @entity79 , @entity32 and left - wing @entity0			1
that would cause problems for @entity14 even if he won a majority			2
but , obviously , a hung parliament is more likely			2
the key question is whether it will lead to stable government , as it did in 2010			2
many then thought , including myself , that the @entity64 / @entity30 coalition could not last			0
but it has , and with a comfortable majority of 78 in the @entity98 it has never really looked in danger of being brought down in @entity8			1
the danger in 2015 is that no majority coalition can be formed			0
under our electoral system , @entity31 and the @entity32 are unlikely to win many seats			0
that is why both support proportional representation			0
the @entity79 , which may well win many seats , will not deal with the @entity1 and will not join @entity0 in a coalition			1
if , as is likely , the @entity30 lose seats then , even if they were prepared to enter another coalition , that might not be able to secure the 325 seats needed for a majority			0
this would mean that no two parties – other than the @entity1 and @entity0 – could command a majority			1
we would have a fragmented hung parliament			0
there would have to be a minority government			0
the last minority government following a general election occurred in february 1974 after @entity124 had gone to the country in the middle of a miners ’ strike asking the voters to decide ‘ who governs ? ’ the voters , however , refused to give a clear answer and , in the fragmented hung parliament that followed , @entity0 governed as a minority for seven months			1
there was then a second general election in october at which @entity0 won a small majority			1
minority governments do not last long and , being dependent on bargaining with other parties , find it difficult to take long - term decisions			0
the longest - lasting was between 1929 and 1931 , but that was buttressed for part of the time by a pact between @entity0 and the @entity146			1
under our electoral system , @entity147 's @entity31 and the @entity32 are unlikely to win many seats in the past , the prime minister could try , as @entity0 did in 1974 , to escape from the minority situation by dissolving @entity8			1
but the 2011 @entity153 , providing for five - year parliaments , makes that option more difficult			0
besides , there is no reason to believe a second general election would , as in 1974 , deliver a majority government			1
it could easily reproduce the same result			0
why have we entered this messy period of multi-party politics , and will it prove more than a temporary condition ? i believe it will , because it stems from a new social cleavage in @entity171 politics , a cleavage between those who have benefited from globalisation , from social and economic change , and those who have been left behind			2
the two major parties , together with the @entity30 , represent the beneficiaries			0
their leaders all believe @entity171 should stay in the @entity56			0
they all broadly welcome immigration			0
they all favour gay marriage			0
but many voters do not favour these things , and feel unrepresented by the mainstream parties			0
@entity186 ( pictured ) and @entity77 are doing to labour in @entity37 what @entity147 is doing to the @entity1 in @entity28 the typical @entity31 supporter is not , as we used to think , disgusted of @entity190 , a retired @entity192 officer spluttering over his gin and tonic at the 19th hole , but a working - class voter or small businessman or shopkeeper who feels betrayed and belittled by the system			1
@entity201 ’s @entity0 sought to win over graduates and middle - class professionals – those who aspired to leave the working class			1
@entity2 ’s conservatives sought to distance themselves from the image of the ‘ nasty party ’ by rejecting @entity208 and embracing modernisation ; while @entity2 and @entity62 , liberal - minded men , seem remote in lifestyle and understanding from those left behind			2
@entity31 , in consequence , is now the most working - class party in @entity28 politics			0
the @entity79 in @entity37 is different from @entity31 in many respects			0
but it , too , represents the left behind			0
the vote in the independence referendum last september was a class vote			0
@entity0 areas in the west central belt around @entity224 voted ‘ yes ’ to independence , while middle - class @entity79 areas in @entity228 and @entity229 voted ‘ no ’			1
@entity230 , with nearly the lowest life expectancy in @entity37 , voted ‘ yes ’ , @entity232 , with nearly the highest , voted ‘ no ’			0
@entity186 and @entity77 are doing to labour in @entity37 what @entity147 is doing to the @entity1 in @entity28			1
the @entity79 could well be the third - largest party in the next @entity8 , even though it will probably secure fewer votes than the @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32			1
that will strain the @entity56 to breaking point			0
in @entity28 , @entity2 says if you vote for @entity147 you will get @entity14			0
in @entity37 , @entity14 says if you vote @entity79 , you will get @entity2			0
but , to the left behind , @entity2 and @entity14 are equivalent – members of an @entity240 liberal elite who represent the exam - passing classes who do not understand the aspirations of the less fortunate			0
that is why the multi-party system is here to stay and why we are about to enter an era of political instability			0
anyone seeking a quiet life should go abroad for the next six weeks .			0

tomorrow the @entity7 dissolves @entity8 and election campaign begins
*due* to economic recovery , most expected the @entity1 to be comfortable
but as it currently stands , @entity0 and @entity5 sit neck and neck
