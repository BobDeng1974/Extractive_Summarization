and then there 's all that flirting : ' online flirting with others may seem innocent but it can still hurt			0
it can lead to your partner not trusting you			0
' even if your flirting is only online and you have not been unfaithful in the flesh , it can still feel like a public slap in the face for your partner			0
' in previous research , @entity16 found @entity60 had a similar effect			2
but whereas @entity60 - related conflict was greater among couples in newer relationships ( of 36 months or less ) , in this latest @entity10 research , @entity16 found the same worrying outcomes occurred regardless of how long people had been together			1
' i found it interesting that active @entity10 users experienced @entity10 - related conflict and negative relationship outcomes regardless of length of romantic relationship , ' @entity16 said			2
tweeting is the source of many relationship woes ' couples who reported being in relatively new relationships experienced the same amount of conflict as those in longer relationships			0
' his advice for @entity10 lovers ? to limit use of social networking sites to more healthy , reasonable levels			2
' although a number of variables can contribute to relationship infidelity and separation , social networking site usage , such as @entity10 and @entity60 use , can be damaging to relationships , ' @entity16 said			1
' therefore , users should cut back to moderate , healthy levels of @entity10 use if they are experiencing @entity10 or @entity60 - related conflict			1
' ' some couples share joint social networking site accounts to reduce relationship conflict , and there are some social networking site apps , such as the @entity105 app , that facilitates interpersonal communication between partners			0
' the @entity105 app is a private , secure network that lets you chat , share , collaborate and coordinate with your partner			0
it features a ' date night ' feature powered by @entity115 's local listings so that couples can browse reviews before deciding where they want to have dinner			0
they can also chat in the built - in messaging space and there 's a private shared journal			0

# @entity129 ! couples are often involved in their social media world instead of interacting with each other dr @entity16 said : ‘ previous research has shown that the more a person in a romantic relationship uses @entity60 , the more likely they are to monitor their partner 's @entity60 activity more stringently , which can lead to feelings of jealousy			1
the research found @entity10 is linked to extreme ralationship issues -- breakups , infidelity and divorce ‘ @entity60 - induced jealousy may lead to arguments concerning past partners			1
‘ also , our study found that excessive @entity60 users are more likely to connect or reconnect with other @entity60 users , including previous partners , which may lead to emotional and physical cheating			1
’ according to the study , , published in the @entity156 , couples who are just starting out should consider staying away from the site			0
dr @entity16 explained : ‘ the findings held only for couples who had been in relationships of three years or less			0
‘ this suggests that @entity60 may be a threat to relationships that are not fully matured			2
‘ on the other hand , participants who have been in relationships for longer than three years may not use @entity60 as often , or may have more matured relationships , and therefore @entity60 use may not be a threat or concern			0
‘ although @entity60 is a great way to learn about someone , excessive @entity60 use may be damaging to newer romantic relationships .			2

excessive @entity10 use *increases* risk of cheating , breakup and divorce
@entity60 has similar affect and *encourages* people to reconnect with ex
people jealously monitor their partner 's activities on social media
