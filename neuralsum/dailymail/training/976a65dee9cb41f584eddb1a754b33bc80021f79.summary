by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 26 february 2013 with its grey shingle beach , often deserted seafront promenades and rows upon rows of terraced houses , @entity1 is hardly known as @entity8 's most picturesque city			1
but one diminutive tourist managed to capture the true beauty of the @entity8 's only island city from a different perspective			2
at just a few centimetres high the tiny @entity14 tourist can be seen photographing @entity17 beach , trainspotting and even slipping on a banana skin			1
little tourist : @entity21 has been photographing a @entity14 man at a variety of locations in @entity1 , @entity25 , since august last year @entity27 visit : @entity21 's tiny subject is seen taking a picture of a bench along the beachfront in @entity17 historic : the diminutive tourist managed to capture the true beauty of the @entity8 's only island city , known as the birthplace of @entity37 , from a different perspective beautiful : the @entity14 man , seen treading carefully on some ice , left , and photographing @entity41 , right , the unique set of pictures was taken by local photographer @entity21 who began taking shots of the @entity14 man in august last year when he wanted to add a common theme to the snaps he was taking			1
since then he has captured the figure in a range of weather conditions and at various locations around the historic city , famed for its @entity53 base and as being the birthplace of @entity37			2
@entity21 , 38 , said : ' the project is n't about the @entity14 , it 's about the character			1
' i used to walk around all the time taking photographs of random things like sunsets , textures , locations , but they had no connection			2
' to capture those moments is great , but they had no theme			2
by following the lego figure day to day it makes the photographs easier to follow			2
tiny : the @entity14 man is dwarfed by some fungi as he continues his tour of the @entity25 city write caption here connection : @entity21 started taking pictures of the @entity14 man , seen here on the city 's shingle beach at sunset , because he wanted a common theme running through his photography photo diary : since the turn of the year , @entity21 has taken 150 images as he seeks to complete a year long project charting 2013 through from the perspective of his little @entity14 subject ' the banana skin photo was an obvious one			1
people always say about it but i 'd never seen it so i decided to make it happen			0
' it 's making everyday things fun			0
' since the turn of the year , @entity21 has taken 150 images as he seeks to complete a year long project charting 2013 through from the perspective of his little @entity14 subject			1
far from employing the latest in photographic technology , @entity21 takes all of the images using his mobile phone			1
explorer : the @entity14 figure is seen photographing a sea shell out of its usual environment and exploring textures on the wall of a @entity1 building @entity112 : @entity21 says that his choice of photographing the @entity14 man slipping on a banana skin was an ' obvious ' one trainspotting : the @entity14 figure is captured climbing up a rusty fence to get a better view of a passing train @entity21 added : ' i enjoy the challenge of doing it all on my phone			1
' sometimes the weather can be really difficult			0
if there 's the slightest wind i feel just as frustrated as the little guy would if he could feel falling over			0
' i call him either " the little guy " or " the legographer "			0
i think giving him a real name would be going a step too far			0
shellshocked : @entity21 pictured his tiny subject looking at the word ' boo ' spelt out on the beach using pebbles all aboard : @entity21 takes the figure everywhere in his pocket in case he comes across an ideal photo opportunity action shot : the @entity14 figure takes care not to get trampled as he photographs a running race in @entity25 ' so far i 've had really positive feedback			1
i do n't think it 's something you can look at negatively			0
' people say they can relate to his mood in the photographs , they warm to them			0
' it 's a surprise to me that it 's been so popular			0
i think it helps people look back on their childhood			0
' @entity21 now carries his lego companion in his pocket everywhere he goes			2
almost all of the images are shot in and around @entity1			0
out and about : @entity21 's subject is seen visiting some buildings that are more suited to his size , left , and doing a spot of shopping , right			1

photographer @entity21 took photographs all around the city
the 38 **-** year **-** old wanted to *introduce* a common theme to his photographs
the @entity14 man is snapped at the beach , trainspotting and shopping
