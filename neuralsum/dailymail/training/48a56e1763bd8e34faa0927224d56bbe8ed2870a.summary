by @entity0 a @entity2 judge has ruled that an inmate with the critical thinking ability of a first - grader is responsible for spending the last 34 years incarcerated on an overturned murder conviction because he never asked for a new trial			1
@entity8 , 56 , has been behind bars without a new trial since 1980			1
but in a recent ruling , judge @entity11 decided that his constitutional right to a speedy trial had not been violated			1
while @entity11 found the state negligent in failing to retry @entity8 , and agreed that the man 's ability to adequately defend himself had sharply diminished , he also found that it was essentially @entity8 's own fault			1
@entity8 remains in prison 34 years after his murder conviction was overturned because he never knew to ask for a new trial as the @entity23 put it , that 's more than 12,000 days waiting for justice			1
the @entity28 native was convicted of robbing and killing a bus station worker in 1976 , the @entity26 reported			0
@entity8 's iq has been estimated at around 51			1
he has long maintained his innocence , claiming police used a false confession in the case			1
he was initially sentenced to die but in 1980 the @entity35 overturned the conviction , ruling that a juror had been improperly dismissed for airing concerns about capital punishment			1
prosecutors have tried and failed twice to get the court to reconsider			0
since then , @entity8 's case has met with one legal obstacle after another			2
@entity8 was on death row before a @entity2 governor commuted his sentence in the wake of his overturned conviction in 1983 , then - governor @entity50 commuted his sentence to life at the request of prison officials			1
according to @entity55 of the @entity56 , it 's uncertain whether @entity50 even knew the conviction had been overturned			0
but , @entity55 added , the commutation was actually issued in error			0
' he could n't commute the sentence because there was nothing left to commute , ' @entity55 said			0
' mr. @entity8 should have had a new trial			2
but he did n't get one			0
' because @entity8 had no legal counsel after his trial ' he just sat there , ' @entity55 said			2
@entity8 did n't understand he needed to ask for a new trial until a fellow inmate advised him in 2006			2
' someone helped him write documents on his own saying ' hey , i never got my new trial , '' @entity55 said			0
@entity8 's iq is estimated at around 51 and he has long maintained police used a false confession to put him behind bars @entity55 is appealing the most recent ruling , @entity8 was finally issued a court - appointed attorney after sending in handwritten legal filings			1
as his case was passed between federal and state courts over the next 8 years , somehow the pick - axe allegedly used in the murder was lost			2
even worse for his chances , key witnesses have died			0
yet after so many years behind bars , @entity8 said he is not bitter and has become a @entity88			2
' being a @entity90 - fearing person , he does n't allow me to be bitter , ' he said in a 2013 interview			0
' he allows me to be forgiving			0
' a hearing on separate proceedings to retry his criminal case is scheduled for next month .			0
