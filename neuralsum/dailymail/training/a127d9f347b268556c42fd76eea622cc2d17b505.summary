by @entity0 the sense of courtliness that is as synonymous with @entity3 as top hats and tail coats has not always extended from @entity7 princes to visiting aristocrats			1
the @entity9 — a few ago — once spied the @entity10 peering at the fish in an ornamental pond and pushed him in			2
his finery took almost as long to repair as @entity16 relations			0
not so here yesterday when the jewel in the season rolled out its most verdant green carpet to welcome @entity21 ’s rulers and their infinite zillions			1
this was the day when @entity21 , whose winter the footballing world are hoping to avoid , imprinted themselves on our summer			1
in the parade ring , close to the @entity3 signs with their crowns , were the five letters : @entity32 , shorthand for @entity34			0
@entity35 ( right ) with @entity36 and the @entity38 winner @entity37 @entity32 are @entity3 ’s ‘ partners ’ and strictly not ‘ sponsors ’ with that word ’s vulgarian overtones			1
what precisely the owner — her majesty — thinks of this is unknown , but apparently all major commercial projects are ‘ briefed in to @entity45 ’			0
discretion has limited the size and scale of the advertising			0
but the @entity52 ruling family of @entity21 , in the shape of two 20 - something - year - old cousins , let their results do the talking for them			1
the first of the cousins is @entity62 , the brother of the emir of @entity21 and something of an @entity65			1
in his dark shades , grey tails and pointy black shoes , he was phlegmatic throughout the afternoon			0
the first victory for his @entity70 came in the opening race , the @entity38 , when the 4 - 5 favourite @entity37 was a convincing winner			0
he smiled calmly , as he did following his second win in the next race , the @entity76 , when @entity77 rode @entity78 to his 48th @entity3 winner			2
the other , slightly younger , cousin — a rival in racing , though they share some horses — is the slightly less svelte @entity84			2
he owns @entity85 ( or @entity86 ) and his approach is more conservative than that of @entity62 , the big spender			0
but for good measure @entity84 , in black tail coat , claimed a second and a third place yesterday			0
the @entity70 silks were carried to glory by @entity77 on board @entity78 in the @entity76 this is only the start of this @entity21 phenomenon that is turning racing upside down			1
already they have invested more than $ 100billion on @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			2
they are fresh to thoroughbred racing but are not new to the sport or to @entity109			2
both cousins , like so many from the region , speak the @entity113 ’s @entity109			0
‘ i grew up with racing , ’ said @entity62 , who turns 28 next month			2
‘ it started in 1991 so it has been quite a long time			0
’ yes , his father started @entity70 in their homeland , a distant precursor to this move into @entity121			0
@entity35 and @entity77 celebrate @entity78 's brilliant @entity76 win @entity123 ( right ) , @entity35 's racing adviser , chats to actor @entity125 ‘ he very much sees @entity129 as representing a good face of his country , ’ said @entity123 , @entity35 ’s racing adviser , the son of the @entity113 ’s former racing manager , the @entity127			1
and today ? the small matter of @entity62 ’s @entity133 running in the @entity134			1
@entity133 is the reigning horse of the year and cost the @entity21 £ 6.4million .			1

sheik @entity35 had two winners on the first day of the royal meeting
the @entity21 royal family have invested millions of *pounds* in @entity7 racing
@entity133 bids to win *tomorrow* 's @entity134 for @entity129 racing
