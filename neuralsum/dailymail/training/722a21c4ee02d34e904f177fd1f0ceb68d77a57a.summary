@entity0 has had 20 years to forgive , forget or apologise for the kung - fu kick at @entity2 which saw the @entity3 transformed from maverick to madman — but , fittingly , he will not have a bit of it			1
two decades after that moment of insanity , when @entity0 launched himself over the advertising hoardings to attack a @entity12 fan , he simply said : ‘ i did n’t punch him strong enough			1
i should have punched him harder			1
’ anyone who remembers the incident or remembers @entity0 , will not be in the least bit surprised by his recollections of one of the most seismic events in @entity21 history			1
@entity0 launches a a kung - fu kick at @entity12 supporter @entity23 in 1995 the @entity3 forward flies into the crowd , hitting target @entity23 and the woman next to him the @entity3 lost his temper in a league match and kicked out at @entity12 player @entity30			1
he was shown a red card and as he left the pitch , @entity0 blew his top at fan @entity23 who was berating him in the front row of the stands			1
@entity0 launched himself into the crowd , following up his kick with a volley of punches before being dragged away by stewards			1

‘ it was a drama and i was an actor			0
i do things seriously without taking myself seriously			0
i think @entity65 found that side of my character and used it very well			0
even when i kicked the fan , it ’s because i do n’t take myself seriously			2
‘ i did n’t think that i had a responsibility not to do it because of who i was			0
