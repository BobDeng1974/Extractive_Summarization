a £ 25billion rival to the @entity1 could be built across @entity2 – funded entirely by the @entity3			1
the hugely ambitious engineering project would give @entity3 control of a vital waterway to challenge the one completed by the @entity8 in @entity1 nearly 100 years ago			1
legislation paving the way for a new canal was given the go - ahead by @entity14 politicians on monday night and is expected to be approved by the @entity15 tomorrow			1
a concession to build a canal across @entity2 linking the @entity18 and @entity19 , likely to go through the waters of @entity2 , are expected to be awarded to a @entity3 company five of the six proposed routes for the new canal pass through the giant @entity2 the canal would cross the @entity26 country – one of the poorest in the region – from the @entity19 coast in the east to the @entity29 in the west			1
it would thus compete directly with the 48 - mile @entity1 further south which gives ships a fast route between the @entity36 and @entity18 oceans			1
about 130 miles of waterway would have to be dug , and 40,000 construction jobs could be created over the 11 years estimated for completion , according to the project ’s supporters			1
when finished , they believe it could capture 4.5 per cent of world maritime freight traffic and double @entity2 ’s per capita gross domestic product			1
a @entity3 - based consortium would finance the construction in return for a majority share in earnings from the potentially lucrative new shipping route			1
@entity52 , @entity2 ’s socialist president , is backing the waterway enthusiastically			2
but many outside observers and @entity52 opponents point out that nearly every key detail remains a mystery , from the exact sources of the funding to @entity2 ’s share of the profits and the precise route			1
critics have also been asking whether @entity26 needs two canals , even in an age of growing world trade			0
@entity1 ’s is already being expanded to take bigger ships			0
feasibility studies have indicated six potential routes across @entity2 , many connecting with @entity2 in the west , but the legislation does not indicate which one would be dug			2
the government plans to grant the @entity74 a concession for an initial 50 years , with the possibility of extending it another 50			0
construction of a @entity14 canal would mark the end of a saga dating back to the 19th century when @entity8 shipping and railroad magnate @entity82 won the right to build a waterway across the country but gave up amid political turmoil			2
rival : a @entity91 container ship moves through the @entity1 on its way to the @entity36 other @entity8 interests then studied building a canal in @entity2 before settling on @entity1 where an attempt by the @entity96 to build a canal had ended in failure			1
the @entity8 took over and completed the job in 1914			0
the canal was owned by the @entity8 until 1999 when it was handed over to the @entity102 government			2
a second waterway linking the @entity36 with the @entity18 has long been in the planning , however			0
the steady increase in shipping since the opening of the @entity1 means there is plenty of financial incentive			0
and with the emergence of @entity3 as a resource - hungry economic superpower , the route is now more likely than ever to become a reality			1
the construction of canal locks and gates for the @entity1			0
@entity1 , in 1913 @entity96 workers using a @entity8 - made @entity121 dredging machine to dig near @entity122 , @entity1 , during the early construction of the @entity1 @entity124 , an environmentalist and adviser to the presidency on environmental issues , said authorities should be defining a specific route for the canal before approving a concession			1
' there are at least six proposed routes and five of them include @entity2 , but there is nothing definite , that 's all part of the unknown , ' he said			2
deputy foreign minister @entity138 , who is chairman of the country 's @entity139 , said monday that he had no doubt the @entity3 company would carry out the project			1
when the 48 - mile long @entity1 was finally finished in 1914 it was described as the ' eighth wonder of the world ' and observers said it would have an impact akin to ' shifting the nations on a map '			0
the international waterway allowed ships to pass between the @entity36 and @entity18 , saving about 8,000 miles from a journey around the southern tip of @entity154 , @entity155			0
the canal makes the trip from the east coast to the west coast of the @entity8 much shorter than the route taken around the tip of @entity154 prior to 1914			2
though traffic continues to increase through the canal , many oil supertankers and military battleships and aircraft carriers can not fit through the canal			0
there 's even a class of ships known as @entity91 , those built to the maximum capacity of the @entity1 and its locks			0
it takes approximately fifteen hours to traverse the canal through its three sets of locks ( about half the time is spent waiting due to traffic )			0
ships passing through the canal from the @entity36 to the @entity18 actually move from the northwest to the southeast , due to the east - west orientation of the @entity184			2
' it 's a very serious company , very responsible and recognized , ' @entity138 said			0
' to doubt ( the company ) is to oppose the project for political rather than realistic issues			0
' the @entity190 - registered company has said that it is willing to fully study the technological , economic , environmental and social impact of the project			2
' this is a great project that has the potential to transform international trade and bring significant economic and social benefits to @entity2 , their neighbors and @entity202 , ' company spokesman @entity195 said monday on the group 's website			1
under the deal , the @entity3 company would pay @entity2 $ 10million annually during the first decade , then pay it a share of canal revenues - an amount that would begin at 1 per cent and rise to an unspecified percentage over the life of the concession			1
after completing the concession , the @entity3 company would have to turn over to @entity2 all buildings and other canal infrastructure			1
@entity215 , who heads an association of @entity14 chambers of commerce , said the lack of details released about the project would slow investment			1
' until you define the path that the canal will have , it will be difficult to attract investment to the area because there is no legal certainty , ' @entity223 said after meeting with committee members			0
another @entity190 - based company has been operating port facilities on both ends of the @entity1			0
the @entity14 canal 's construction would mark the end of a long push that began at least as far back as the 19th century when @entity8 industrialist @entity82 won the right to build a waterway across the country but gave up amid political turmoil			0
other @entity8 interests then studied building a canal in @entity2 before settling on @entity1 as the crossing point			1
@entity1 is nearing the end of a seven - year , $ 5.2billion expansion project to allow bigger ships to use its waterway			2
that project is scheduled to be finished next year .			0

proposal fast - tracked through the ruling party - controlled *congress*
it happened despite a lack of details about the huge project
supporters claim the canal could double the *gdp* of @entity2
but route has *n't* been set out , or funding *arrangements* with @entity3
