by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 20 february 2013 yellow - legged @entity2 hornets that prey on bees are among the latest non-native species threatening @entity6 wildlife , and even people ’s health			2
a growing number of alien species , from killer shrimps to @entity15 slugs , are set to soon reach our shores , a @entity10 - wide study warns			1
the @entity2 hornet , which grows to between 2.5cm and 3cm ( 1 - 1.2 inches ) , preys on native honeybees , wasps and other pollinators , potentially devastating hives and threatening honey and crop production			1
killer : the @entity2 hornet can measure up to 1.2inches long and preys on honey bees			1
wasps and other polinators the hornets could devastate bee hives , threatening the production of honey and crops the report from the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) also warned of the spread of the @entity2 tiger mosquito , which is linked to more than 20 diseases including yellow fever and the dengue - like chikungunya fever			1
the species is prevalent in several southern @entity10 countries , such as @entity43 , and is likely to expand its range north as the climate changes			2
a number of alien species already in the @entity6 are causing problems			2
common ragweed , which came in to @entity10 from @entity50 in bird feed is a potent trigger for hayfever and other allergies			0
the @entity15 slug , which reaches up to 15cm ( 6 inches ) in length can hit garden planting and horticulture , as they eat plants as well as carrion and even each other			1
well - established invaders from across the @entity64 include the @entity66 mink which has destroyed water vole populations and the grey squirrel , from @entity50 , which has driven its native red cousin from most of @entity70			0
more recent arrivals include killer shrimps , which feed on other aquatic wildlife and can cause local extinctions of naturally - found species and zebra mussels , thought to have arrived in ship ballasts , which can damage infrastructure such as water plants and locks			1
the new list of invaders join established non-native species which have set up home in @entity6 such as the grey squirrel ring - necked , or rose - ringed , parakeets are now found across much of @entity6 , and there are concerns that they damage fruit crops by targeting buds and blossoms of various trees and shrubs			0
they may also carry diseases which can affect humans and are often seen as a noise nuisance in urban areas because of their loud screeching calls			0
other species posing problems to the @entity6 include brook trout , @entity66 bullfrogs , rhododendrons , @entity105 knotweed , harlequin ladybirds and the horse chestnut leaf - miner moth			0
across @entity10 , invasive alien species cost around £ 10 billion a year , the @entity35 report said			0
species are most commonly brought in for horticulture , while other reasons they are brought in include farming , hunting and fishing or as pets			2
some stow away , such as the zebra mussel and are introduced unintentionally , the study said			0
increasing tourism and trade in recent decades may have led to increasing numbers of alien invaders , while climate change may also be playing a role in the spread of species , by making areas increasingly suitable for new plants and animals			1
invading plants and animals are a major threat to already - struggling wildlife , with 110 out of the 395 @entity10 species designated as critically endangered at risk of dying out because of non-native species			0
@entity139 , @entity35 executive director , said : ‘ in many areas , ecosystems are weakened by pollution , climate change and fragmentation			1
‘ alien species invasions are a growing pressure on the natural world , which are extremely difficult to reverse			0

*predators* , which can grow up to 1.2inches long , could threaten hives
asian tiger mosquito , killer shrimps and @entity15 slugs also a problem
climate change , tourism , trade and horticulture to blame for influx
