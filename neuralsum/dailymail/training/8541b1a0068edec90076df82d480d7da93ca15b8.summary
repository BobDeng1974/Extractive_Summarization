action needed : @entity1 , the top family judge			1
says that contraception should be forced on problem parents problem parents with up to 15 children should be encouraged to use contraception by the courts , one of @entity9 ’s most senior judges said last night			1
sir @entity1 , @entity10 of the @entity11 , said it is a ‘ distressingly regular occurrence ’ that mothers end up with their dozen or more children taken into care			1
he praised the concept of @entity18 , which are being set up in several areas to control the problem			0
these courts can give parents with huge families contraception to prevent ‘ repetitive pregnancies ’			1
the judge , who is the most senior family judge in @entity9 and @entity27 , made his comments at the annual meeting of the @entity30			0
‘ the new @entity18 projects have dealt with the taking into care of 14 children of one mother and colleagues have dealt with a case of 15 , ’ he said			1
‘ i have certainly dealt with a case of 11 children			1
these cases are still happening			0
eleven children being taken into care , or 14 children – these are very usual			1
‘ repetitive pregnancies and repetitive care proceedings are a distressingly regular occurrence			2
’ the court proceedings involve social services , drug and alcohol experts and doctors , who draw up plans for parents			1
they also meet judges one - to - one rather than in the courts			2
it is hoped that this approach will keep children out of care and the parents out of prison , or off drink and drugs			1
‘ with some local authorities contraception is an important part of the thinking , ’ sir @entity1 said			1
‘ the whole thing is very intensive but it does seem to work			0
the savings if you can avoid care proceedings are enormous			2
’ dropping the traditional adversarial approach used in @entity75 courtrooms in favour of a @entity78 - style inquisitorial approach had helped the new courts be successful , he added			2
‘ that was a difficult concept for lawyers to accept , ’ he said			0
‘ they were worried about what their clients might say			0
but it has been an absolutely key component in getting @entity18 to work			0
the judge is able to built up a personal rapport with the mother and father			0
and from the parents ’ point of view , it makes them feel part of the process rather than being a spectator			2
’ in a wide - ranging speech , he pointed out there was a ‘ tension ’ between government guidelines in adoption and a recent key ruling from the @entity105			0
he said : ‘ ministerial guidance came out , in spring last year , which contained at some point the statement or an exaltation that social workers should get away from the idea that adoption is a last resort			0
backing : sir @entity1 , one of the most senior judges at the @entity11 , says that avoiding care proceedings will save a fortune ‘ two months later a ruling from the @entity105 said adoption should in fact only be used as a last resort			1
they are very difficult to reconcile – that is judicial speak for irreconcilable			0
in the final analysis , if there is a clash between what the @entity105 says and the guidance says , then under our constitutional system the @entity105 wins			0
’ if politicians wanted to shift the balance in favour of the @entity135 guidelines , making adoption more frequently used , they should change the law , he added			0
' with some local authorities contraception is an important part of the thinking ... the whole thing is very intensive but it does seem to work ' sir @entity1 he added that the courts must also devise a system which allows children taken into care to find out the reasons for the decision in later life , if they wish , saying : ‘ we do n’t deal with this adequately ’			1
sir @entity1 has said previously that a controversial court which can make life - or - death decisions and send people to jail in secret , should be opened up to public scrutiny			1
addressing a conference in @entity156 last autumn , he indicated that the rules for the @entity158 should be changed to make it more transparent			2
sir @entity1 said it should be treated in the same way as the family courts where media are allowed to attend			1
he is also keen to further open up the family courts – which journalists can now attend but are more often than not prevented from reporting the details of a case			2
he said that while there were differences between the family court and the @entity158 , they should be part of a single system			0
more judgments should be published , so the public could have confidence justice was being done .			0

@entity1 says contraception should be forced on some parents
he says mothers with up to 15 children lose them into care regularly
new courts make parents agree plans on drugs , alcohol and contraception
studies show they lead to more children being handed back to parents
