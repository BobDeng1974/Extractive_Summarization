by @entity0 published : 03:37 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 09:21 est , 20 december 2012 a smiling @entity1 gave @entity4 's exclusive @entity3 - themed nightclub her seal of approval last night when she partied the night away with the @entity7 set			1
the 29 - year - old was chic in a monochrome ensemble of black suede ankle boots , a flared snakeprint skirt and smart black jacket as she left the new @entity14 venue with new beau @entity15			1
her appearance at @entity17 will lend cachet to the latest venture for @entity20 , 30 , a close friend of the princes who is said to have organised @entity24 's stag do			0
glossy posse : @entity1 shakes the rain from her umbrella as she climbs into a taxi outside hip new nightspot @entity17 stylish couple : the 29 - year - old looked chic in black suede ankle boots and a monochrome snakeprint skirt , while new beau @entity15 was handsome in a navy suit and grey scarf , with a bright blue shirt seal of approval : the attendance of the younger @entity1 sister could trigger a flood of visits by the inner circle of young royals making waves : @entity15 and @entity1 have been dating since october and appear to have plenty in common the @entity46 's sister kept out the cold with sensible black opaques , swishing her long mane of glossy chestnut hair and grasping a black leather clutch as she cheerfully slipped out of the club under the shelter of an umbrella			1
@entity4 's last @entity7 nightclub , @entity56 , was forced to close after complaints that it had become the well - heeled area 's ' number one crime generator ' , with rich twenty - somethings causing havoc as they stumbled home in the early hours			2
@entity64 - educated @entity4 owns popular clubs @entity66 and @entity67 , but still needs the boost of a successful new project after the embarrassing blow of @entity56 's closure led some to speculate that he was relying on the status of his well - connected friends			2
so @entity1 's beam as she left the fledging nightspot will do much to cement the stylish reputation of the club , which launched in october to great fanfare			0
swish event : the socialite seemed in good spirits after her night at the fledging @entity14 club royal cachet : @entity1 's chic appearance will be a boon for @entity4 , whose last nightclub venture was shut down after becoming @entity7 's ' number one crime generator ' @entity89 ! @entity1 and friends enjoyed tequila - based cocktails served in skull - shaped bowls and mixed at their table , as well as sharing platters loaded with nibbles including tacos and nachos christmas night out : @entity1 let her hair down as she showed off her new squeeze to friends the partygoers lounged on hammocks and were served tacos on sharing platters and cocktails in skull - shaped punch bowls at the themed bar , already a hit with the likes of @entity111 , @entity112 and prince @entity113 's on - off girlfriend @entity114			1
@entity1 seems happier than ever since she started appearing in public with @entity15 last month , just weeks after splitting with cricketing boyfriend @entity116			0
the rugged 34 - year - old @entity118 graduate could be the perfect man for the younger @entity1 sister , having worked at @entity121 private bank and procuring the release of hostages in @entity124			2
he is already well used to the royal circle , as the ex-boyfriend of prince @entity24 â€™s former squeeze , @entity128			0
new author @entity1 certainly looked more than pleased with her pre-christmas night out at the subterranean @entity17 , and her visibly glowing recommendation could trigger a rush of young royals keen to down some tequilas at the trendy venue .			0

the 29 - year - old enjoyed tequila - based cocktails and @entity3 sharing food
the younger @entity1 sister had new beau @entity15 in *tow*
@entity4 's last nightclub , @entity56 , was closed for generating crime in the area
