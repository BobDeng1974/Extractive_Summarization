@entity1 political editor @entity0 has reason to question the spelling ability of @entity6 @entity5 users after his feed on the site was swamped with abuse by people who 'd confused him with @entity13 star @entity12 , who 's at the center of so - called ' deflategate '			1
@entity16 star @entity12 is busy deflecting allegations that his team used deliberately deflated balls to gain an advantage over the @entity21 on sunday , who they beat to win a place in the @entity25			1
thousands have taken to @entity5 to voice their opinion about the matter , but many have tweeted abuse at @entity1 's presenter instead of the @entity13 star , who is n't on the social media site			1
he wrote on @entity39 on thursday ' how many @entity6 ca n't spell ? ' and then pasted hundreds of messages below directed at him by @entity13 fans			1
he added : ' this is my timeline on @entity5 this morning			1
or , to be more accurate , just a part of it			2
it goes on and on and on , pages and pages and pages of it			0
something to do with deflated balls apparently ... ' i am considering two courses of action - writing to @entity12 , star quarterback of the @entity16 , to ask him to please get onto @entity5 so i do n't have to read all the abuse meant for him any more or sponsoring a new @entity6 spelling bee			1
feel free to tell me which you would recommend			0
' @entity12 became implicated in the scandal when @entity16 coach @entity59 told the media they should address comments they have about the footballs to @entity12			1
' i think we all know that quarterbacks , kickers , specialists have certain preferences on footballs			2
they know a lot more about it than i do			0
they 're a lot more sensitive to it than i am , ' he explained			0
' i hear them comment on it from time to time , but i can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy whatsoever from me on that subject			0
@entity12 's personal preferences on his footballs is something he can talk about in much better detail and information than i can possibly provide			1
' @entity16 head coach @entity59 talks to the media during a press conference to address the under inflation of footballs if , for any reason , anyone on the @entity16 is found to have anything to do with sunday 's underinflated balls , they would face up to a $ 25,000 fine on thursday @entity12 and @entity99 both appeared on nationally televised press conferences to rebut the claims as the controversy swirling around @entity6 's biggest sporting event reached fever pitch			1
@entity13 chiefs are probing allegations that balls used by the @entity16 offense in their 45 - 7 rout of the @entity21 on sunday were inflated below standard league levels - giving @entity12 and his team - mates an advantage by making them easier to handle			1
but @entity12 , one of the scandal - tainted @entity13 's biggest stars , flatly denied any involvement in the scandal dubbed ' deflategate			1
' ' i did n't alter the balls in any way , ' said @entity12 , who is preparing for a record sixth @entity25 in @entity121 on february 1			1
' i feel like i have always played within the rules			0
i would never break the rules , ' added @entity12 , a three - time @entity25 winner and two - time @entity125			2
@entity12 's comments echoed those made earlier in the day by @entity59 , who said he was ' shocked ' to learn of the possibly illegal footballs on monday			1
' i have never talked to any player , staff member about football air pressure , ' @entity59 said			0
' to me , the footballs are approved by the league and game officials pre-game , and we play with what 's out there			2
' @entity12 had originally laughed off the suggestion of wrongdoing by the @entity16 in a radio appearance on monday , thinking it was ' sour grapes			2
' by thursday , the 37 - year - old superstar was aware of the magnitude of the issue			0
' it 's very serious , ' @entity12 said			1
' obviously , integrity of the sport is very important			0
' however , he added that he believed he and the @entity16 would get through it			0
' things are going to be fine , ' he said			0
' this is n't @entity152			0
no one 's dying , ' he said , referring to the militant group waging war in @entity157 and @entity158			2
although the league has given no timetable for announcing its findings , they have reportedly found that 11 of 12 balls provided by the @entity16 for the game did not meet league standards			0
@entity12 said he had yet to be contacted by league officials about the issue , which seems certain to cloud the build up to the @entity25 in @entity169 , @entity121			2
the title game and its attendant halftime show draw millions of viewers , with television advertisers paying as much as $ 4 million a slot to reach the massive audience			0
@entity12 of the @entity16 throws a touchdown pass to @entity177 ( not pictured ) against the @entity21 @entity12 talks to the media during a press conference to address the under inflation of footballs used in the @entity183 championship game at @entity184 @entity12 , who also regularly appears in celebrity news magazines due to his marriage to @entity187 supermodel @entity36 , admitted the controversy had soured his preparations for the @entity25			1
' it 's disappointing that a situation like this happens , ' @entity12 said			1
' obviously i would love to be up here in a very joyful mood			0
these are the best two weeks of the year if you happen to be one of the two teams still playing			0
' the whiff of scandal could be especially damaging for the @entity16 , who have been sanctioned for infractions in the past			0
@entity59 was fined $ 500,000 and the team docked $ 250,000 over the 2007 ' spygate ' affair , in which the @entity13 found they illegally filmed another team 's hand signals during a game			1
if the @entity13 does find the @entity16 purposely under - inflated the balls , they could be subject to fines and the loss of draft picks			2
as for the @entity25 , @entity12 said he believes whatever the outcome of the league 's probe , his team belongs there			1
' i feel like we won the game fair and square , ' he said			0
the controversy comes at the end of an @entity13 season dogged by lurid headlines over domestic violence scandals , with @entity229 star @entity228 kicked out of the sport after video emerged of him punching his future wife unconscious in an elevator			2
@entity234 running back @entity235 also saw his season cut short when he was suspended for severely whipping his four - year - old son with a tree branch .			0
