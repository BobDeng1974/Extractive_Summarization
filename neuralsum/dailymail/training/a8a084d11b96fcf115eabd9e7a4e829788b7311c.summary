@entity1 's @entity0 could vote on @entity3 laws to prop up a @entity5 government			1
the former first minister has hinted that the @entity7 would be prepared to ditch the long - standing convention that its mps do not vote on laws that only affect @entity3			1
instead they would take part in commons votes to help @entity13 pass laws if @entity5 falls short of an overall majority in next year 's election			1
@entity1 suggested @entity9 could vote on @entity3 laws to prop up a @entity5 government mr @entity1 formally stepped down as @entity7 leader and first minister last month after voters in @entity20 rejected his dream of independence in september 's referendum			1
he announced earlier this month his bid to return to @entity25 and was unveiled as a candidate for the @entity7 nomination for the @entity29 constituency in @entity30			2
mr @entity1 hopes to steal the seat from the @entity32 , with current @entity32 mp sir @entity33 retiring in may			0
some polls have put the @entity7 on course to win dozens of seats from @entity5 , leaving mr @entity13 with a rump of just a handful of mps north of the border			1
such a result would shatter his hopes of securing a majority in may next year , forcing him to rely on other parties for support			0
however , with the @entity47 likely to have the most mps in @entity3 , it would be difficult for a @entity5 government to pass laws without the support of the @entity7 â€“ whether in a coalition or a confidence and supply deal			1
such an arrangement , which could see @entity7 mps rethink their practice of abstaining in @entity3 - only legislation at @entity25 , would be on a ' vote by vote ' basis			2
polls suggest @entity13 could be left with a rump of just a handful of mps north of the border mr @entity1 pointed to two pieces of legislation not directly affecting @entity20 which he opposed when he was an mp : the introduction of foundation hospitals and tuition fees			1
he told @entity70 : ' there will be many things that come across the @entity25 desk that would be of little moment to @entity20 people , but will be of great moment to the government of the day			2
' mr @entity1 said he would ' lay odds ' on a balanced parliament , also known as a hung parliament , which occurs when no party secures an absolute majority of seats			0
' that 's an opportunity to have delivered to @entity20 what we have been promised , ' he said			2
last month , mr @entity1 formally stepped down as @entity7 leader and first minister following september 's independence referendum result			1
he announced earlier this month his bid to return to @entity25 and was unveiled as a candidate for the @entity7 nomination for the @entity29 constituency in @entity30			2
mr @entity1 hopes to steal the seat from the @entity32 , with current @entity32 mp sir @entity33 retiring in may			0
the former first minister told the @entity70 that a ' barrel - load ' of @entity7 mps would win seats at the 2015 general election			1
he added that the @entity7 's key objectives in any negotiations at @entity25 after the election would be to ensure the @entity104 's political leaders keep their pledge to transfer powers to @entity20			1
@entity108 leader @entity107 said he could do a deal with @entity5 after the election @entity107 has made it clear that he would be ready to do a deal with @entity5 if @entity108 holds the balance of power after next year 's general election , but said ' it would n't be easy '			2
the @entity108 leader has previously said that he would ' do a deal with the devil ' in order to secure @entity104 exit from the @entity121			0
speaking on @entity122 , he made clear that any agreement to go into coalition or support a minority government would depend on the parliamentary arithmetic produced by the election next may , rather than by his political sympathy with either of the major parties			0
while insisting that he disagreed with @entity5 leader @entity13 on most subjects , mr @entity107 said he would be ready to ' do a deal with somebody that i otherwise would n't normally do ' if it meant restoring the @entity104 's ability to govern itself			0
' we are facing , in four - and - a - half months ' time , the most uncertain general election that we 've seen for many , many decades in this country , ' said mr @entity107			0
' all the balls are up in the air , chiefly because of the effect @entity108 has had on politics			0
' either the @entity47 or the @entity5 will emerge as the biggest party after that election			1
' given our constitutional history and precedent , the monarch would expect the larger of the two parties to attempt to form either a formal coalition or some kind of support mechanism or deal where you can actually have a government there that can get a budget through @entity156			0
' if we find ourselves - and it 's an if , of course it is - in a position where we actually do hold the balance of power , whilst everybody thinks it 's more likely that it 's @entity164 who would need @entity108 support , it 's not absolutely impossible that it could be @entity13			0
' but i disagree with almost everything mr @entity13 stands for and it would n't be easy			0

former first minister suggests @entity7 could ditch convention to avoid votes
@entity20 party *traditionally* only takes part in votes on @entity20 matters
polls suggest @entity5 faces *wipeout* in @entity20 , *harming* hopes of *victory*
