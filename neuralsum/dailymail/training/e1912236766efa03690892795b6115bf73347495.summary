by @entity1 reporter published : 00:54 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 01:12 est , 1 may 2012 a @entity3 advocacy group launched a free mobile application on monday that allows travelers to complain immediately to the government if they feel they 've been treated unfairly by airport screeners			1
launched at midnight on monday by the @entity10 , the @entity9 app had fielded two complaints by 10am the same day			1
the first complaint came from a woman who said she felt mistreated after she disclosed to a screener that she was carrying breast milk			1
hi - tech : launched at midnight on monday by the @entity10 , the @entity9 app had fielded two complaints by 10am edt the same day a @entity3 man filed the second complaint , saying he was subjected to extra security even though he had not set off any alarms			1
the woman 's complaint was based on gender and the man 's on religion , said coalition program director @entity24			1
@entity24 said the @entity25 and @entity26 were notified of the app before its launch			2
the agencies agreed to allow the app to use the agencies ' system for submitting the complaints			1
@entity26 said in a statement that it does not profile passengers on the basis of race , ethnicity or religion and is continually working with communities , including the @entity10 , ' to help us understand unique passenger concerns			2
' the agency said it supports ' efforts to gather passenger feedback about the screening process			2
' @entity47 : the app is intended for everyone who feels they are racially profiled or subjected to other unfair treatment by the @entity26 the app , available for @entity54 and @entity55 phones , was conceived in response to complaints from @entity3 in the @entity58 , who since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks are routinely subjected to additional inspection , @entity24 said			1
some are made to remove their turbans , which @entity3 wear for religious reasons , @entity24 said			2
the app is intended for everyone who feels they are racially profiled or subjected to other unfair treatment			1
it is also intended to provide better data on how often such incidents occur			2
in light of the shooting of @entity75 , immigration laws in @entity77 and @entity78 , and the anniversary of the @entity81 trial , ' it has never been more readily apparent how the practice of racial profiling impacts all @entity58 , ' said @entity84 , president and ceo of @entity86			1
the conference helped launch the app. after completing screening , a person can go to the app and click on the ' report ' button			2
the app will automatically fill in the person 's name , phone number and email address			0
the app asks questions such as race and name of airport , as well as the basis of the complaint , such as religion or gender			0
it has ' submit ' and ' share ' buttons to post on social media that a complaint was filed			0
the app also contains information on rights of passengers and @entity26 procedures			0
the @entity10 gets hundreds of complaints of unfair treatment and profiling , @entity24 said			1
by contrast , he said , the @entity25 said in its last report to @entity121 on civil rights and civil liberties that 11 people in the @entity58 submitted complaints in the first six month of 2011			1
' my hope is that this app will exponentially increase the number of complaints filed with the @entity26 , flood the system so they get that this is a problem			1
for too long the @entity26 has been able to tell @entity121 this is not an issue , nobody 's complaining , ' @entity24 said			0
passengers can ask to speak to supervisors or customer support managers at an airport , contact the @entity140 , submit feedback through ' talk - to - @entity26 ' online or file a civil rights complaint through its website , the agency said			0
@entity145 , a motivational speaker , said he has been profiled 30 times , starting in february 2007 when he was taking an early morning flight from @entity149 / @entity148 to @entity77			0
in that incident , he was told he had to go through a mandatory pat - down of his turban , even though he had not set off the detector			0
but after asking for information on the @entity26 policy , a supervisor told him he could not fly , he said			0
' out of those 30 incidents , i have not yet been able to take myself and write down all the information i needed to and been able to convey that to the @entity10			0
this app will allow me to do that , ' said @entity145 , who is not related to @entity24			0
' when i sat down on that airplane , after that experience , i looked around at everybody else ... and i thought , they did not have to go through what i had to go through to get on this airplane , ' he said .			0
