despite managing to stabilise mr @entity0 , he suffered ' catastrophic ' brain injuries and his family were forced to switch off his life support machine eight days later			1
he was married to wife @entity29 and had two sons			0
his family slammed the care he received at the clinic and say doctors prevented them having one last conversation with him			2
sports fanatic mr @entity0 , of @entity37 , north @entity4 , was admitted to @entity38 with chest pains on september 16			1
he was then transferred to the clinic with a severe lung infection two days later			2
dr @entity13 also blamed the experienced nurse for errors during attempts to reinsert the tube when it became clear it was not providing an air supply			2
shortly after he gave evidence at @entity22 this morning , coroner @entity48 adjourned the hearing to enable nurse @entity16 to seek legal representation			2
financial analyst mr @entity0 was starved of oxygen and suffered a cardiac arrest when his ventilator tube slipped while he was treated for pneumonia at the prestigious @entity3 on september 22 last year			1
nurse @entity16 told the inquest she had noticed mr @entity0 's ventilator tube , known as an @entity59 , had slipped ' one to two centimetres ' from his mouth when she went to assess him after seeing his heart rate drop			1
but she said she did not check it was correctly in place and failed to pass the information on to dr @entity13 when he answered the emergency call after the patient went into cardiac arrest			1
dr @entity13 told the hearing he received a ' brief account of events leading up to the cardiac arrest ' from @entity74 when he arrived in mr @entity0 's room			1
coroner @entity48 asked dr @entity13 : ' was any mention at all made of the @entity59 ? ' he replied : ' i was not made aware of any incidents at all regarding the @entity59			0
' coroner @entity48 said : ' if @entity83 did have any concerns about the @entity59 , for example if it had moved , would you expect that information to be passed on ? ' ' yes , ' @entity86 said , adding : ' a clear airway is first and foremost the important thing when managing a cardiac arrest			1
' on initial inspection of the upper airway i found the tube was not going through the vocal chords but was disappearing out the back and into the oesophagus			2
' i informed the team it was dislodged			0
i cut the tube and removed it and asked for an oxygen mask			2
' by the time the mask was placed on mr @entity0 's face , he had been starved of oxygen for at least 15 minutes , causing him ' catastrophic ' hypoxic brain injuries , the inquest heard			1
dr @entity13 went on to describe how @entity74 , described by the coroner as a senior member of staff with many years ' experience , then hindered his attempts to reinsert a new @entity59			0
he said : ' in this case , she went on to remove the bougie [ a guiding aid for the air tube before i had sufficient time to advance the @entity59 far enough for it to be in the trachea			0
' given the importance the lack of oxygen in mr @entity0 was , i immediately removed the tube and reinserted the oxygen mask instead of wasting time looking for other ways to confirm the position			1
' mr @entity0 had been receiving treatment for pneumonia at the @entity3 , pictured , after being transferred from @entity38 mr @entity0 had then been without oxygen for at least 15 minutes and dr @entity13 told the inquest it was his experience that patients would start to suffer brain injury between three and five minutes without air			1
coroner @entity48 , addressing dr @entity13 , said : ' if support had been given to mr @entity0 at about 6.31am , could his brain injury have been averted ? ' ' in my opinion , yes , ' he said			1
' steps should have been taken to confirm whether the airway was secured or in the appropriate position			0
' coroner @entity48 then adjourned the inquest until next month to allow nurse @entity16 to seek legal representation			0
her decision to delay the hearing , which had been expected to conclude today , reduced members of mr @entity0 's family to tears in the public gallery			1
the coroner said : ' the evidence we have heard this morning has taken this inquiry in a different and unexpected direction			0
' the evidence clearly suggests there was an omission by @entity156 that may have caused or contributed to mr @entity0 's death			2
' it is properly arguable that , had she done something to rescue that compromised airway , we would not be here at all			0
because of the seriousness of that i feel we have no choice but to adjourn			0
' earlier doctor @entity169 , in charge of mr @entity0 ’s care , told the inquest : ' he was in severe respiratory distress , struggling to breath , move or talk			1
' he was receiving oxygen through a tight - fitting mask , but we decided to put him on a ventilator to pre-empt him requiring emergency breathing assistance			1
' mr @entity0 ’s wife , @entity29 , said she and her sons were not informed of the decision to place him on a ventilator , robbing them of their last chance to speak to him			2
in a statement read to the court , she said : ' the nurses said they were putting lines in him for the antibiotics and would be about 30 minutes			2
' after about an hour - and - a - half i became troubled as still no - one had come to see me			0
they never said anything about putting him on a ventilator			0
' i was particularly upset about the complete lack of communication			0
it would have been better if they would have explained what they were doing and why			0
' dr @entity169 said that in hindsight he ' regretted ' not keeping the family informed			0
he said : ' i wish mrs @entity199 had the chance to say goodbye			0
' mrs @entity199 said she had serious concerns about the treatment her husband had received at the @entity3 , adding : ' he was a fit and healthy man			1
' he loved golf and exercising at the gym			0
he had a very active social life , attending charity events			0
@entity22 , pictured , heard that a nurse failed to tell her supervisor about the displaced tube ' i have lost my husband and my two sons have lost their father			1
i have a number of concerns about his treatment at the @entity3			1
' i do n’t understand how they allowed this tube to become dislodged when he was paralysed for so long			2
' mr @entity0 was given sedation drugs after he started to resist the ventilator and was pumped with five different types of antibiotics to try and fight the lung infection , the inquest heard			1
but on september 22 , six days after he was admitted to the @entity3 , he suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after 6.35am as he lay paralysed in bed			1
data recorded on the ventilator showed mr @entity0 ’s oxygen levels had plummeted in the minutes leading up to his cardiac arrest			1
coroner @entity48 asked dr @entity169 : ' would it be fair to say this dislodging led to a lack of oxygen and then the damage to his brain and his subsequent death ? ' and would it be fair to say that , but for the dislodgement , this death would n’t have occurred at this time ? ' dr @entity169 replied : ' yes '			2
nurse @entity16 , who rushed to mr @entity0 ’s room after seeing his heart rate drop on monitors at the nursing station , told the inquest : ' his heart rate slowed down to 40 from 60 or 70			1
' at the time , the line was flat and there were no numbers on the screen			0
' i heard a colleague say they had increased the oxygen to 100 per cent			2
then i saw the @entity59 ( oxygen tube ) was one to two centimetres away from his lips			1
” she added : ' the saturation probe was not in the right place			0
it could have been disconnected from the monitor			0
' asked if she checked the connection , ms @entity83 said : ' no '			0
asked what she did next , the nurse said : ' it did not come to my mind to do anything because it happened quickly			0
' i told my colleague to perform cpr and put out the call			0
people arrived in less than two minutes			0
' @entity280 , of @entity281 representing the family , said : ' the inquest being on the anniversary of the events in question has obviously been very distressing for the family			2
' as you can imagine they are enormously distressed that they now have to wait even longer for answers			0
beyond that , they have no comment to make			0
