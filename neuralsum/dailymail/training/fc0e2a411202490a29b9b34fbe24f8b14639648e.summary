@entity0 could be given powers to sack @entity2 under new laws following a series of scandals failing crime tsars could be sacked by the home secretary under radical plans to rescue the @entity9 ’ tarnished law and order policy			1
police and @entity12 can currently only be removed at the ballot box every four years , but a series of scandals has prompted a rethink			1
@entity0 joined the chorus of calls for @entity20 pcc @entity18 to stand down last week after he was implicated in @entity23 ’s failure to tackle the sex abuse of thousands of young girls			1
@entity28 pcc @entity26 also faced calls to quit after a documentary showed her struggling to explain her role and embarrassing her chief constable			2
and last week @entity33 ’s @entity32 was suspended by @entity34 while he faces possible criminal charges over leaking sensitive information about a death to his partner			0
now a senior group of elected crime tsars is drawing up ideas to improve their own accountability between elections			0
the @entity44 can reveal that among the options are : the proposals , to be submitted to the @entity48 by the end of the year , will prove controversial as they would dilute the independence of the role			0
but sources said reform was needed as the @entity54 , which got off to a bad start when only 15 per cent of voters turned out in the £ 75 million elections two years ago , was being damaged by recent scandals			2
one senior @entity54 said : ‘ if somebody does n’t resign , in extreme cases the home secretary should be able to recall the person and kick them out			1
the home secretary joined a chorus joined the chorus of calls for @entity20 pcc @entity18 ( left ) to stand down following @entity23 's child abuse scandal , while @entity26 also faced calls to quit after a documentary showed her struggling to explain her role and embarrassing her chief constable ‘ we are the ones who most keenly feel the concerns [ in the wake of the @entity20 case ]			1
’ @entity77 have joined @entity34 in indicating they would scrap @entity78 completely at the next election and return to a system similar to the old police authorities , where power is in the hands of a group of councillors rather than an individual			1

they are held to account by the most effective check on any politician – the ballot box			0

@entity104 and @entity105 can only be removed every four years
but a series of scandals has prompted a rethink in the current *legislation*
home secretary joined calls for @entity20 pcc @entity18 to quit
he was implicated in @entity23 's failure to tackle systemic child *exploitation*
giving the *public* the right to ‘ recall ’ errant @entity78 via a *petition* , as is also under *consideration* for *mps* .
forcing @entity126 to run on a joint ticket with their proposed *deputies* , to avoid *cronyism* claims and allow a smooth *succession* if one loses their **job** .
*strengthening* the powers of local *watchdogs* , known as @entity104 and @entity137 , to stand up to @entity78 .
granting the home secretary the power to sack @entity78 in extreme circumstances , such as in @entity142 where *mr* @entity18 is *clinging* to his **job** despite *key* figures *insisting* his *position* is untenable .
