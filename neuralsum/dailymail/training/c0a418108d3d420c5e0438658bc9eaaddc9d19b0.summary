professor @entity0 says that disappearance of a @entity3 army in 524 @entity4 has been solved , thanks to deciphering ancient temple blocks in 524 @entity4 , a @entity3 army of 50,000 men sent by @entity9 marched into the @entity11 desert from @entity12 - now known as @entity13			1
but , after entering the desert , they were never heard from again			0
it has been presumed they were swallowed by a sandstorm , but now a researcher claims that was n’t the case - and instead they must have been defeated in battle			1
in the 5th century @entity4 , @entity25 historian @entity24 wrote that the disappearance of the army could be attributed to an unfortunate end involving sand dunes			0
@entity30 egyptologist professor @entity0 , however , disagrees			1
‘ since the 19th century , people have been looking for this army : amateurs , as well as professional archaeologists , ’ he said			0
‘ some expect to find , somewhere under the ground , an entire army , fully equipped			0
‘ however , experience has long shown that you ca n't die from a sandstorm , let alone have an entire army disappear			2
’ professor @entity0 is now putting forward an entirely different explanation			1
he argues that the army did not disappear , but was instead , defeated			2
‘ my research shows that the army was not simply passing through the desert ; its final destination was the @entity48 , ’ he said			0
‘ this was the location of the troops of the @entity11 rebel leader @entity51 ‘ he ultimately ambushed the army of @entity9 , and in this way managed from his base in the oasis to reconquer a large part of @entity11 , after which he had himself crowned @entity58 in the capital , @entity60			1
’ according to @entity24 , @entity62 - the son of @entity63 the @entity61 - sent the soldiers from @entity12 to attack the @entity65 in 524 bc. their mission was to destroy the oracle at the @entity68 after the priests there refused to legitimise his claim to @entity11			2
but after they left , they were never seen or heard from again @entity24 wrote that the disappearance of the 50,000 - strong @entity3 army ( illustrated here ) could be attributed to a sandstorm			1
professor @entity0 , however , claims @entity11 rebel leader @entity51 ambushed them - but this embarrassment was swept under the rug by @entity9 @entity0 said he made the discovery accidentally			1
in collaboration with @entity82 and the @entity83 , he was involved for the last ten years in excavations in @entity85 , in the @entity48			0
and earlier this year , he deciphered the full list of titles of @entity51 on ancient temple blocks			2
‘ that ’s when the puzzle pieces fell into place ’ , said the @entity0			2
‘ the temple blocks indicate that this must have been a stronghold at the start of the @entity3 period			0
‘ once we combined this with the limited information we had about @entity51 , the excavation site and the story of @entity24 , we were able to reconstruct what happened			1
’ according to the @entity25 historian @entity24 ( 484 - 425 bc ) , @entity9 , the son of @entity63 , sent the soldiers from @entity12 to attack the @entity65 in 524 bc. their mission was to destroy the oracle at the @entity68 after the priests there refused to legitimise his claim to @entity11			1
after walking for seven days in the desert , the army was said to have arrived at an ' oasis ' , which historians believe was @entity114 , 120 miles ( 190 kilometres ) west of the @entity115 in the @entity116			0
after they left , a great sandstorm sprung up and they were never seen again			0
@entity24 wrote ' a wind arose from the south , strong and deadly , bringing with it vast columns of whirling sand , which entirely covered up the troops and caused them wholly to disappear '			0
however , the new research by professor @entity0 says it was n’t a sandstorm at all that defeated them - but rather another army in an embarrassing defeat , which was later covered up			1
the fact that the fate of the army of @entity9 remained unclear for such a long time is probably due to the @entity3 king @entity135 , who ended the @entity11 revolt with much bloodshed two years after @entity9 ’ defeat			1
he attributed the shameful defeat of his predecessor to natural elements , and 75 years after the events , all @entity24 could do was take note of the sandstorm story			0
but now this new research sheds light on one of the greatest archaeological mysteries of all time .			0

@entity152 professor believes he *'s* solved the mystery of missing @entity3 army
professor @entity0 claims the 50,000 - strong army was defeated in battle
*previously* it had been thought the army was swallowed by a sandstorm
but new *analysis* of *hieroglyphics* reveals this story was merely a cover - up
instead they were defeated by a rebel army led by @entity51 in 524 bc
