@entity1 @entity0 , 46 , thought she had laid six - month - old @entity9 to rest in 1999 , but only found out more than a decade later that police had in fact removed virtually all her vital organs			1
the little girl died after being flung at a wall by her father , @entity15 , then 24 , who flew into a rage when his lottery number 's did n't come up at their home in @entity20 , @entity21			1
he was convicted of her manslaughter and jailed for four years after throwing her so violently she suffered brain damage and four skull fractures when her crying disturbed his number checking ritual			0
@entity9 's body was returned to ms @entity0 fully - clothed and a funeral was held shortly after the tragic death in april 1999			1
but police failed to tell ms @entity36 she was burying her daughter with much of her body parts missing			1
it was only two years after a national police audit in 2010 that she received a letter informing her that @entity9 's vital organs were held in a fridge at @entity45 in @entity46			1
her liver , spine , bowel , lungs , kidneys , heart , spleen , thymus , stomach , pancreas , trachea and skull fragments had all been retained without ms @entity60 's consent			1
she received a further blow this month when police admitted that her brain had been cremated in 2009 , after it had been sent to a hospital in @entity65 for examination , without their knowledge			2
the organs were stored as police investigated @entity9 's death and kept in case @entity15 appealed his sentence			1
ms @entity36 said : ' after the funeral i felt i could try and move on			1
but now i feel lied to by everybody			0
i feel conned by the authorities , they have kept this secret from me for all these years			0
' the idea that i buried my girl without her heart and brain has completely broken me			0
those are the parts that make a person			0
what they let me bury was n't my daughter			2
@entity1 @entity0 , pictured holding baby @entity9 in 1998 , thought she had laid her to rest in april 1999 after she was tragically killed by her ex-boyfriend @entity15 ' there were two detectives at the funeral - and they did n't mention a thing			1
this revelation has brought all the heartache back again			0
my world was torn apart			0
' ms @entity60 , who went on to have two more children , will hold @entity9 's second funeral at @entity98 in @entity21 where her remains will be placed on top of her original coffin			1
she said : ' this whole thing has been like living in a real - life horror movie			2
i never dreamt that i would have to go through burying my daughter again			2
' i feel really upset and angry at the thought of having to go ahead with another funeral			2
i have had to sign a form to open up her grave which is just awful			0
' once the funeral is over i feel at last i can put everything behind me and try to move on			2
' i will feel happier when i know she is with her heart and everything else			0
i know she 'll finally be a peace			0
' she now plans to make a formal complaint to @entity117 , which runs @entity118 where @entity9 's brain was destroyed			1

' we kept the specimens prepared for microscopic examination but we were obliged by new guidelines to dispose of the remainder of the tissue			0
' this was ten years after the opinion had been given			0
it was carried out in a respectful manner and in line with the best practise guidelines of the @entity146			0
' subsequently we were contacted by the police in 2012 to whom we then returned the examination specimens that had been retained			0
' ms @entity36 has also complained to @entity45 , but bosses have said they acted as requested by the police			1
@entity9 's liver , spine , bowel , lungs , kidneys , heart , spleen , thymus , stomach , pancreas , trachea and skull fragments had all been retained at @entity45 , @entity46 , without ms @entity60 's consent a @entity166 spokesman said : ' we followed the procedures for storing organs in line with the protocols for police investigations at that time			1
' @entity172 said : ' in 2010 , all police forces in @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 were tasked with conducting an audit of any human tissue samples which had been retained as part of criminal investigations that had since been concluded			2
' we sought to undertake the notifying of families sensitively , prioritising the wishes of the families affected			0
