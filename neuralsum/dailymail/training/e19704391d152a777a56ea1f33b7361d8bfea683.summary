the entry for @entity1 on @entity2 was one of the most viewed pages during 2014 gaining 4.7million hits on may 24 alone popular pages on @entity2 during 2014 have been revealed with one of the most read entries being ' @entity1 '			1
for eight days running starting on may 18 , the entry was the most viewed page reaching a peak of 4.7million hits on may 24			1
but despite being one of the most read pages on the encyclopedia site last year , it is unclear why so many people worldwide were searching for the term			2
the list of last year 's most viewed @entity2 pages has been compiled by website @entity20 , who analysed the top viewed page every day of last year			1
during the study , they found that most of the top results followed big news events , with the profile of actor @entity28 being viewed more than 5.1million times on august 12 , the day after his death			0
the profile for fellow actor @entity32 was also the top viewed page with 1.7million hits on february 2 , the day of his death			0
during early march , the entry for @entity38 was the most - well read , which coincided with the region 's annexation by @entity42			0
meanwhile during most of june , while the @entity45 was taking place in @entity47 , its entry on @entity2 was the most viewed on almost half of the days in the month			1
but for other pages , such as ' @entity1 ' , researchers are unable to say why they were so popular , although one explanation is that during this time @entity1 prime minister @entity52 announced cuts to programmes that help his country 's aboriginal population			2
another possible explanation is it came in the lead up to @entity60 , which is in honour of the @entity62 in @entity63			0
other pages which also received high page views for no apparent explanation is the entry for the dinosaur species triceratops , which received 1.1million hits on march 28			1
there were also two consecutive days of more than a million views of the malware page and the entry explaining the meaning of alliteration was the most viewed entry for seven consecutive days			2
the wikipedia page on @entity1 , which was the most viewed entry on the encyclopedia site between may 18 and may 24 last year however , the site explained : ' because the data measure page views and not unique visitors , they are subject to distortion from bots , or software that requests pages programatically			1
' a software developer could accidentally write a bot that views a page tens of thousands of times instead of once			0
this helps explain the very large numbers of views for random pages like @entity96			0
' the results almost mirror the most searched for terms on @entity99 last year , which also saw the @entity45 being one of the most popular searches			2
the @entity2 entries for the late actors @entity28 , left , and @entity32 , right , were the most viewed in the days following their deaths during june , the entry for @entity45 was the most read page on @entity2 while the tournament was underway in @entity47 globally , searches for the @entity28 proved popular as did the terms @entity111 's @entity110 6 , and the @entity113 crisis			1
