by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 21 october 2012 updated : 15:13 est , 22 october 2012 for many retired couples , paying the dreaded energy bill leaves little left - over at the end of the month			2
but pensioners @entity4 and @entity6 have managed to slash their bill to an incredible £ 3 a month after researching the latest ways to cut their usage			1
a solar hot water system , a wood burner and solar panels have all helped the couple to cut their energy bills			1
the real good life : @entity4 and @entity6 have spent thousands of pounds renovating their bungalow in a bid to achieve the ultimate ' carbon - neutral ' green lifestyle the greenest couple in @entity21 ? the couple have a garden full of fruit and vegetables mr @entity26 , 77 , started looking into ways to save money on their energy bills when he and his wife started having money problems 37 years ago			1
‘ it was a time of economic uncertainty in my industry , ’ said mr @entity26 , a semi-retired naval architect			0
‘ i was a hovercraft engineer and there did n’t seem like there was a future in it at that time			0
‘ we had three children , and i thought things would be quite bleak with all of us and little money			2
’ in a bid to save money , the couple renovated their bungalow in the @entity47 to include a solar hot water system , a wood burner and solar panels which produce more electricity than they use			1
they also have a solar - powered car and grow their own fruit and vegetables - all their money - saving essentials have helped them reduce their bills to almost nothing			1
the only gas they use is for their stove , and their amazing bill of around £ 3 a month includes the annexe they rent out as a holiday home			0
reminiscent of the tv series @entity71 , which hit the screens in 1975 , the couple started their quest to become self - sufficient in the 1970s			1
living off the land : @entity76 collected wood for the fire fuel for thought : the couple have a solar hot water system , and solar panels which produce more electricity than they use and a wood - burning stove wheels : the couple also have a solar - powered car which is powered by electricity produced by their solar panels they decided to sell their home and buy a larger one in the @entity47 where they could keep livestock and grow their own food			1
but now , their innovations are no longer about saving pounds but saving the planet , and are part of a whole green lifestyle			0
dubbed ‘ @entity21 ’s greenest couple ’ , @entity26 and mrs @entity6 never fly , and mr @entity103 , even celebrated his 70th birthday with a cycling holiday from his home in @entity107 to @entity108 , @entity109			1
mr @entity26 said : ‘ we went in for self - sufficiency in a big way			0
’ ‘ we had a cow , pigs , chickens , sheep and grew masses of vegetables - it was hard work but great fun			1
’ some of the self - sufficiency aspects have now gone - they found they did n’t have time to keep animals any longer			0
although their initial motivation was to save money , as the couple learnt more about global warming they became increasingly concerned about their own impact on the environment			2
mr @entity26 added : ‘ the science is quite clear - for the world to halt climate change it needs a 100 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide by 2050			0
’ when he semi-retired around ten years ago the couple decided to step up their efforts to live a zero - carbon lifestyle			2
they estimate they are somewhere between 90 and 99 per cent carbon - free			0
standing test of time : their house is filled with inherited furniture - they still cook with pans that were a wedding present 55 years ago cheap and cheerful : the cosy home is almost completely powered by solar and green energy , including solar panels ( pictured ) their house is filled with inherited furniture and items that have stood the test of time - they still cook with pans that were a wedding present 55 years ago			1
@entity71 : the couple have been likened to @entity166 and @entity167 from the hit 1970s tv programme on the couple ’s decision to give up travelling by planes , mrs @entity6 , 79 , a retired music teacher , said : ‘ we do n’t want to feel we are killing people while we travel			1
’ ‘ our last flight was to see family in @entity177 about ten years ago - we came back by cargo ship			0
‘ the return journey took us a week and it was expensive - it cost about three times as much as flying - but it was lovely			0
’ since then their holidays have involved travelling by ferry , train , bus , cargo ship and bicycle - which is how they got to the @entity193 island of @entity194			0
the couple admit they are fortunate to be able to put their environmentally friendly methods in place , but hope to inspire others to reduce their carbon footprints			2
admittedly some of their projects have incurred costs , while others have been time - consuming , but for @entity21 ’s greenest couple that ’s not what is important			2
mr @entity26 added : ‘ it gives one a nice feeling when you have a hot shower on a cold winter morning and know the water has been heated by the sun. ‘ i claim that ’s a completely different tingle ! ’			0
