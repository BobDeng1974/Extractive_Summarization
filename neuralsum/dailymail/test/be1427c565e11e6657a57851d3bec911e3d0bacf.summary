@entity1 pundit @entity0 has laid into referee @entity2 after he failed to award @entity3 a penalty during their 2 - 0 defeat at @entity6 on monday night			1
an incident in the 38th minute of the game , saw @entity9 felled by a reckless challenge from @entity11			1
although replays clearly showed the defender scything @entity9 down and not making contact with the ball , @entity2 did not point to the spot			0
@entity0 said during his analysis , ' it was an absolute stonewall penalty			2
the gasp in the ground , @entity11 just kicks him right in the knee			0
' @entity9 drives into the @entity6 box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by @entity11 @entity11 makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball , sending the @entity27 tumbling @entity1 pundit @entity0 could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the @entity29 at @entity30 he added that @entity2 's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call			1
' i think we said it last week , in the game , we always look at the ref 's position			0
but you look at @entity2 's view of it and he 's got no excuse , he 's staring right at it there , he 's so close , within five or six yards			0
it 's just a poor decision			0
' before @entity11 's foul , @entity46 had put @entity6 in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes ; and @entity51 wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from @entity57			2
the misery was only to be compounded for @entity3 , as stand - in captain @entity59 saw red for a second bookable offence			2
with @entity3 trailing 1 - 0 , a penalty could have offered them a way back into the game , but nothing was given @entity9 lies on the ground as @entity67 ( left ) clears the ball and @entity11 ( right ) protests his innocence @entity59 ( right ) hands the captain 's armband to his manager after he is sent off for a stamp			1
