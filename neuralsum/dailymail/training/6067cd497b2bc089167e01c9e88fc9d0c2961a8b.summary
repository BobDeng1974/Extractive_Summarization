wolfing down an entire box of chocolates is enough to make anyone feel a little full			1
but for @entity10 the dog , who was rushed to the vet after eating a tin of @entity8 with the wrappers still on , the binge was just the start of his discomfort			2
for once taking a peek at the @entity17 's stomach , vets were shocked to discover the animal had also eaten five rubber toys			1
booster the @entity17 was rushed to the vet by owner @entity21 after eating an entire tin of @entity8			1
there , x-rays revealed he had in fact also swallowed five rubber balls ( pictured above ) x-rays showing five toys in @entity10 's stomach			1
the dog has since had an operation to have them removed it came after his owners @entity35 and @entity21 from @entity36 , @entity37 , found the dog severely bloated and writhing in pain after eating the chocolates that had been left over from @entity42			1
' we came downstairs one morning and he was the size of a cow , ' said mr @entity21 , a builder			2
' he was really bloated and did n't look well - we could see he had eaten a 750g tin of @entity8 so we took him to the vets			1
' after spending two days in vets ' care , @entity10 was sent home but still seemed to be in pain			2
when mr @entity21 returned to weeks later , an x-ray revealed the pet had swallowed five rubber balls that were lodged in his stomach			1
' he takes them off other dogs in the park and tends to chew them up , so we try to keep him away from balls , ' mr @entity21 , 55 , said			0
' but we never thought he would eat one , let alone five			0
' mr @entity21 said in the past he had tried to keep booster away from rubber balls as he had a tendency to chew them up the dog owner knew something was wrong with his pet after finding him writhing in pain and bloated ' to the size of a cow ' one morning after @entity42 @entity74 , of @entity75 where @entity10 was treated , said the dog 's pain came after gases from the chocolates stopped his blood flow			1
' his immediate problem was that all of the gas blowing up his stomach was preventing blood from flowing back to his heart , and so his circulation was failing			0
' it was only weeks later mr @entity74 discovered the toys lurking in his stomach			0
' x-rays showed some very strange shadows in his abdomen and exploratory surgery yielded two balls and three toys from his now slightly sagging stomach			2
' however , not a quality street in sight			0
' @entity10 has recovered from his surgery with further care at the hospital and on examination this week has returned to his old , noisy and slightly cantankerous self			0
' we still do n't know where the toys came from and how long they had been inside his stomach			0
' they only seemed to cause him a problem after his chocolate eating antics			0
we are hoping for no repeat performances and are very glad that mr @entity21 had him insured for all of his life saving treatment			0
