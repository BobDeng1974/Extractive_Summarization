once again , this was a @entity1 performance that lacked conviction			1
once again , this was a @entity1 performance that made you wonder just what their defensive training entails at their @entity9 training ground			1
once again , this was a @entity1 performance that posed more questions than answers for their manager @entity14			1
at half - time , @entity1 had seemed well on their way to a third win in a row and although this particular showing remained lightyears away from the dynamic and eminently watchable performances of last season , it would have taken them only five points behind @entity27 and within touching distance of the top four			1
@entity14 ’ side , however , do not resemble a team capable of challenging for @entity33 football , despite the best efforts of @entity35 and @entity27 to invite them back into the race			0
in truth , they were lucky to escape from this game with a point			0
@entity40 hit the post inside the opening exchanges when @entity44 was caught cold and a @entity63 free - kick cannoned off the inside of the post			1
@entity1 failed to heed the warning			2
further chances passed @entity40 by before their hosts were granted the initiative by a referee decision that @entity71 described as the ‘ worst ever ’ on @entity72			2
certainly , @entity73 did not help his cause by sliding in , arms outstretched and flailing like an octopus but it did strike his head and @entity40 have justification to be aggrieved			2
for a while , there were signs that @entity1 were discovering the zest and rhythm of happier days , particularly in the speed and skill of @entity86 and @entity87			2
they remain the two @entity1 players most eminently capable of raising this @entity1 team when they feel the need			0
it was this combination that combined so beautifully to slice open the first goal , as @entity87 received the ball on the half - turn , pirouetting into space and zipping a reverse ball into the run of @entity86			0
@entity14 watches on as his @entity1 side squander a 2 - 0 lead at home to basement boys @entity40 @entity103 had put @entity1 2 - 0 up after scoring two penalties in the first half of the match gerrard slots home to score the second of his first - half penalties to double @entity1 's lead at @entity42 @entity112 captain @entity103 ( right ) pumps his fists after scoring the first goal of the game on @entity116 @entity40 's @entity117 ( centre ) protests his innocence after the referee awards @entity1 a penalty with the score at 0 - 0 , @entity40 captain @entity73 ( left ) concedes a penalty from @entity86 's cross the @entity40 players argue with referee @entity126 after his decision to award @entity1 their first penalty @entity129 gives a thumbs up to the away fans after pulling one back for @entity40 in the second half after the second penalty , we wondered briefly whether @entity136 may steam into overdrive			1
there was one wonderful effort from @entity140 who arrowed a volley inches past the juncture of post and bar , almost replicating the @entity147 effort at @entity148 all those years			0
in the second half , however , all that momentum dissipated			0
the vulnerabilities of the 3 - 5 - 2 system were exposed by a direct @entity40 outfit			1
gaps appeared between the defence and midfield , defenders backed off as @entity103 and @entity157 were caught too high up the pitch			0
at 2 - 2 , @entity1 were the side that appeared edgy , short on confidence and unable to seize the initiative			1
there was a telling moment when @entity103 had possession on the right flank and with those in front of him stood like statues , he gestured furiously for some movement			0
a familiar groan rang out from those fans around the press box			0
they have seen this ordinary level of performance far too often this season			0
@entity129 takes the ball back to the halfway line as @entity40 looked to level things at @entity42			1

@entity1 drew 2 - 2 against @entity40 in the @entity54
@entity129 and @entity39 's goals *embarrassed* @entity1
