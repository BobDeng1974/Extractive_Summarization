by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 19:19 est , 2 september 2012 fresh questions about @entity3 ’s role in @entity4 were raised last night after commanders suspended the training of the country ’s police militia amid fears it had been infiltrated by the @entity11			1
military chiefs took the drastic step in response to a rise in the number of murderous ‘ green on blue ’ attacks – where foreign troops have been killed by @entity4 policemen or soldiers			1
rogue members of the security forces have carried out 34 attacks this year , killing 45 coalition troops , including seven @entity3 servicemen – a quarter of the @entity3 ’s 31 war dead since january			1
criticism : fresh questions about @entity3 's role in @entity4 were raised last night after commanders suspended the training of the country ¿ s police militia amid fears it had been infiltrated by the @entity11 building up the @entity35 is the key plank of @entity38 ’s strategy for withdrawal of combat troops			1
international soldiers are training and mentoring @entity4 forces so they can assume responsibility for the country ’s security by the end of 2014			2
it means that @entity38 soldiers must work closely with the @entity4 police they are training			2
plan : international soldiers are training and mentoring @entity4 forces so they can assume responsibility for the country 's security by the end of 2014			2
it means that @entity38 soldiers must work closely with the @entity4 police they are training this requires them to live , sleep and go on patrol together			0
but it involves a huge amount of trust , and this has been slowly eroded by the shocking rise in the number of ‘ green on blue ’ attacks			1
there are 9,500 @entity3 troops in @entity4			1
the suspension of training currently only applies to new recruits to the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , a militia set up two years ago by @entity71 forces in villages where the @entity73 – a separate body trained by @entity38 – is weak			0
but the @entity69 has been beset by allegations of abuse and widespread corruption			0
it is also believed that insurgents had infiltrated the organisation in order to carry out insider attacks			1
@entity71 commanders said they would temporarily suspend training of around 1,000 new @entity69 recruits and re-vet members currently belonging to the 27,000 - strong security force			0
in july , warrant officer class 2 @entity88 , 44 , ( not pictured ) from the @entity90 , @entity91 , 22 , ( centre ) and @entity93 , 28 , right ) of the @entity94 the @entity95 , were killed in a ' green on blue ' attack and the sale of @entity4 army and police uniforms will be made illegal so they are less likely to fall into @entity11 hands			1
colonel @entity103 , spokesman for @entity71 forces in @entity4 , said : ‘ while we have full trust and confidence in our @entity4 partners , we believe this is a necessary step to validate our vetting process and ensure the quality indicative of @entity4 local police			1
’ he insisted the suspension of training would be ‘ temporary ’			0
but @entity115 mp @entity114 , said the decision was yet another reason to bring @entity3 troops home			1
he said : ‘ it ’s about time we realised we are funding , arming and training our future enemies and it is only because of our misplaced optimism that we have got ourselves into this situation			0
there is no reason why @entity4 police officers will put their own lives on the line to serve their corrupt president , let alone a foreign power			0
they are , however , very happy to take the enormous sums of money we have invested in the country			0
‘ we are in a terrible situation with politicians trying to spin an end to the war in a good light			0
the timetable for the end of the war is designed entirely for election purposes			0
‘ @entity144 and the @entity145 , who have both made great sacrifices in @entity4 , have brought their troops home			2
there is no reason why we should n’t bring ours home now – independently of @entity71 troops			2
’ the @entity153 and @entity73 , trained by @entity38 forces including @entity3 troops , are not affected by the suspension			1
the training of @entity4 special forces will also continue			0
on average , 7,000 @entity4 soldiers and 3,700 @entity4 police graduate from training every month			0
around 130,000 @entity38 troops are fighting insurgents in @entity4 alongside 350,000 @entity4			2
the @entity69 have been to blame for a number of green - on - blue attacks , but more come from the regular army and police force			1
re-vetting the national police and the @entity167 would be an enormous task			0
the coalition forces said they believed that 25 per cent of this year ’s attacks had confirmed or suspected links to the @entity11			1
sometimes insurgents have infiltrated the ranks of the @entity4 army and police but in other cases the @entity11 has coerced legitimate members of the @entity4 forces to turn their guns on foreign troops			2
intelligence reports have highlighted ‘ deep concerns ’ that one in ten recruits were vulnerable to being turned by the @entity11 .			0
