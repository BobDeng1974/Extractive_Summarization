by @entity0 published : 18:26 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 18:53 est , 10 june 2013 we were walking home together when my ten - year - old daughter told me she had eaten a cake at school that day			1
this perhaps unremarkable statement left me overjoyed because , throughout her life , @entity8 has lived with a potentially life - threatening milk allergy			1
holy cow : a cow 's milk allergy is extremely common , affecting up to 8 % of children , including ten - year - old @entity8 @entity8 's allergy was so severe that she could not manage anything containing even the tiniest amount of milk , such as a regular sandwich with butter or an ordinary biscuit			1
for years we had been among hundreds of thousands of @entity24 families meticulously planning allergen - free lives			2
in our case this meant dairy - free meals and hunting for alternatives to milk - based treats			2
at birthday parties , @entity8 could n't touch any of the cake , but would have to take her own box of dairy - free food			1
we 'd pack soya milk cartons for holidays abroad			2
restaurants were the hardest , when she would scour the dessert menu hoping for something she could eat			0
i 'd normally have to shake my head and promise her an alternative at home			0
@entity8 was always incredibly accepting and mature about it			2
a cow 's milk allergy is extremely common , affecting up to 8 per cent of children and usually developing in the first year of life			1
this means it can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms , such as reflux and diarrhoea , are common during infancy , explains dr @entity58 , a consultant paediatrician at @entity59			0
' on average , it takes three months and six visits to the gp before a milk allergy is diagnosed , ' he says			1
diagnosis is based on a skin prick test - a small amount of the suspected allergen is inserted under the skin with a tiny needle and raised , red skin is a sign of allergy			1
milking it : by having small doses of foods made with milk , @entity8 was eventually able to overcome her allergy there is also a blood test to check levels of the antibodies which trigger an allergic reaction and a ' food challenge ' - when food containing the suspected allergen is given in the controlled environment of the hospital			1
but for us , the diagnosis was unequivocal and unforgettable			0
@entity8 was breastfed , so her first taste of dairy was from formula milk mixed with baby rice when she was six months old			1
she had three spoonfuls and screamed			0
her face quickly began to swell			0
by the time i had dialled 999 , @entity8 's left eye had disappeared under the swelling			1
an ambulance took us to @entity103 at @entity104 where she was given a dose of adrenaline - this reduces inflammation and swelling in the throat , opening the airways and easing the itching			2
a blood test confirmed she had a severe allergy			0
an allergic reaction happens when antibodies become over-sensitive and attack the proteins in certain foods			0
these antibodies then bind themselves to the allergen and cause the release of chemicals , including histamine , which triggers swelling , itching , rashes and tightening of the airways			2
in extreme cases , it can cause anaphylactic shock , with severe swelling , breathing difficulties and sometimes loss of consciousness			0
' a food allergy , particularly to milk , which is in so many foods , has a massive impact upon a child and their family , ' says dr @entity140 , consultant paediatrician in allergy at @entity142 , @entity143			2
one study of 40 children , half with a food allergy and half with diabetes , found those with food allergies reported more fear about their health and eating , and more restrictions on their life overall			1
when it came to @entity8 's brother @entity160 , now seven , we avoided giving him any dairy products for his first year			1
we were overjoyed when , aged one , he had a blood test which showed his risk of milk allergy was very low			1
he has eaten freely since			0
with the help of my husband , @entity167 , 46 , a communications manager , i found we could make dairy - free cake and obtain dairy - free ice cream for @entity8			1
her annual hospital tests showed little change in the allergy			0
the tests checked her levels of @entity176 antibodies which trigger an allergic reaction			0
a normal reading is 0 to 6 - at the age of six , @entity8 's result was 78 , slightly higher than when she was younger			1
' she had three spoonfuls and screamed			0
her face quickly began to swell			0
by the time i had dialled 999 , @entity8 's left eye had disappeared under the swelling			1
' most children do grow out of their milk allergies - with about 80 per cent becoming fully tolerant by school age			1
it 's thought this is due to a natural reduction in the @entity176 antibodies , and a rise in @entity195 , which blocks the antibodies from binding to the allergen			2
' we used to say 90 per cent will grow out of a milk allergy by school age , but we 're now seeing a growing number of children whose allergy persists longer , sometimes beyond age ten , ' says dr @entity140			1
this seems particularly the case for children with more severe milk allergies			2
even eight months ago , @entity8 became itchy after mistakenly having a few spoonfuls of porridge made with cow 's milk			1
but a new scheme could offer these children an alternative to a life spent anxiously avoiding dairy			2
dr @entity58 has established the @entity24 's first cow 's milk tolerance system , which manipulates the immune system to actually cure the allergy			1
it 's an approach more widely used in @entity225 and the @entity226 and based on immunotherapy , a long - established treatment for hay fever sufferers			1
' the principle is if you give someone very small doses of the allergen , very slowly building it up over time , their sensitivity to it will decrease , ' says dr @entity58			1
the programme is for children with a milk allergy which has persisted to the age of six			1
they start by having a drink which is 1 per cent milk to 99 per cent water			0
the dose is incrementally increased over 67 consecutive days up to full cow 's milk			1
so far 50 patients have completed the course , with 23 completely overcoming their allergy and nine developing partial tolerance - for example , they could eat cake made with butter , because the milk proteins have been partially broken down during baking			1
' we 've worked with children who had really severe milk allergies who went on to develop full tolerance , ' says dr @entity58			2
beating the allergy : @entity8 's experience and dr @entity58 's scheme demonstrate it is possible to cure the allergy ' it can be challenging for them - children usually have tingling lips and sometimes suffer nausea and vomiting			1
' but this has enormous implications because it means we can offer families more than avoiding the allergy or hoping their child will outgrow it			0
' the one - third for whom it does not work are not necessarily the ones with the strongest allergies			0
some struggle with the side - effects of the programme , such as nausea and mild sickness , and do not complete it			0
a similar programme exists for nut allergy sufferers at @entity295 , @entity296 , and @entity24 experts are likely to follow colleagues in mainland @entity225 and @entity299 in setting up a tolerance programme for egg allergies			0
but in her own way , @entity8 had already stumbled across the approach by herself			1
last year during breakfast , she mistakenly had a piece of toast with butter			0
she kept quiet , but came into the kitchen ten minutes later , asking whether the toast had butter on and grinning broadly as we realised it had			0
' nothing happened , mum , ' she said			0
we were both excited about what this could mean			0
she later tried cheese - flavoured crisps , and then a teaspoon of dairy ice cream			0
the second caused her lips to tingle , but she said it was ' ok because it will go away soon '			0
she had recognised the familiar symptoms of an allergic reaction , but also had the confidence to sense they were mild and temporary			0
if anything , i had a greater fear of @entity8 eating foods containing milk than she did			1
and @entity8 became increasingly determined to overcome her restrictive diet			2
once she had eaten dairy ice cream several times , the lip tingling disappeared			0
soon , there was nothing on the ' forbidden ' list			0
by the time @entity8 tried a cake at school , she 'd eaten enough similar food at home to give her the confidence to go ahead			2
the time from @entity8 's first taste of butter through to full tolerance was less than three months			2
we had not heard of dr @entity58 's programme , but its principles reflected much of what i 'd witnessed with @entity8 - motivation is important , as is confidence that symptoms can be handled and that the allergy can be overcome			1
but dr @entity140 warns people with allergies to avoid trying known allergens at home without supervision			0
' there can be severe and even life - threatening reactions and we see this particularly with teenagers , who are fed up with a restrictive diet , ' he says			1
watching @entity8 tuck into her first ever ice cream on the beach on holiday recently , it seemed as if a miracle had occurred			2
moving to an unrestricted diet is surely something which , if possible , should happen for children sooner rather than later .			0

a cow 's milk allergy affects up to 8 % of children , including @entity8
last year , @entity8 overcame her potentially life - threatening allergy
she introduced small doses of the allergen to decrease her sensitivity
this approach is also used by new schemes that can cure the allergy
