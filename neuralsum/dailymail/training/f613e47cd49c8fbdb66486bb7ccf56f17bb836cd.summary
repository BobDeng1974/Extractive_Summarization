according to the @entity133 , judge @entity132 warned them not to be swayed by their impact : ' your verdict must not in any way be influenced by the fact that these photos may be unpleasant and graphic			0
' mr @entity8 is entitled to a verdict based solely on the evidence , and not one based on pity or sympathy for the deceased			0
' the defense opened their side of the case with the questioning of @entity8 's aunt , who said that mental illness runs in the family and that her nephew had slipped into a deep depression after the break up			1

the point of the question was to help bolster his case that @entity8 was a teen with health issues who snapped and had mental episode that lead him to kill his long - term girlfriend			1
