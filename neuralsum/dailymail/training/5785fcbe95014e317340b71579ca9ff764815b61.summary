by @entity0 published : 02:04 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 09:45 est , 6 november 2012 turmoil : @entity2 weeps as she makes an appeal for information about her missing daughter the distraught mother of a missing girl kidnapped three years ago wept yesterday as she told of fears she may have been sold on the black market in a child trafficking racket			1
former charity worker @entity2 , 32 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , has not seen little @entity13 since her third birthday in 2009 when she was snatched by her father in a spiteful act of revenge during a planned day trip to the seaside			1
former insurance salesman @entity20 , 28 , who was livid at being spurned by @entity2 , jetted off to his native @entity21 with @entity22 before contacting her mother saying : ' you ’ll never see your daughter again			1
' despite a global inquiry spanning three countries , the youngster has not been heard of since and now it is feared she may have been sold by her father to another family living in @entity21 or @entity32			1
@entity20 returned to the @entity33 less than a fortnight after he flew out and is now serving a fourth consecutive jail term for contempt after defiantly refusing to reveal @entity37 ’s whereabouts - dismissing @entity2 as ' only a birth mother '			1
today on what would be @entity37 ’s six birthday @entity40 sobbed as she pleaded for information about what happened to her daughter			1
' i pray she ’s okay but we do n’t have any proof that she ’s okay and no proof she is even still alive , ' she said			1
' it ’s been discussed that she could have been sold , but i do n’t want to believe it			1
' as far as i ’m aware she has n’t been with any family member so i can only assume she ’s with strangers			1
' to know that she ’s safe , to know that she ’s being looked after , to know where she is			1
a child does n’t disappear , does n’t evaporate			2
a child is put somewhere and people know - and that information needs to be talked about			1
' @entity2 met @entity20 in 2003 while they were on the same college course at @entity63 and @entity37 was born on november 7 , 2006			1
but @entity2 ended her on / off relationship with @entity20 in 2008 due to him being possessive and controlling and he swore revenge on her			1
during an access visit on the youngster ’s birthday he said he was taking @entity22 to @entity70 but instead , he took her to @entity71 where he claimed she was staying for a week with relatives			2
adorable : @entity37 before she was abducted			2
police believe she may be being hidden in @entity21 mystery : a computer - generated image of what @entity37 might look like now @entity37 was supposed to share a flight with her grandmother on november 16 , but the grandmother came back alone			1
@entity20 himself returned to the @entity33 on november 20 without his daughter and he was subsequently arrested			1
he claimed he handed @entity37 to a mystery man called @entity84 and taken to @entity32 but an address for the shady mr @entity86 proved to be false			2
@entity2 said : ' it ’s been an absolute nightmare			1
when i close my eyes i see @entity37			2
i say good night to her every night before bed			2
' i just want @entity37 back home but her father ’s just not prepared to back down - he ’s not prepared to work with the police			1
he ’s enjoying playing his controlling mind games			2
' it ’s just sick			2
he still refuses to reveal his daughter 's whereabouts and has been given a fourth jail term for his silence she added : ' we have n’t celebrated her birthday since she went missing but i ’ve bought her presents each year - they are waiting for her to open when she comes home			1
' on the day she went missing she was due to spend some time with @entity20			2
she was picked up by her uncle and taken to go see him			2
she was due to come back the next day and spend some time with her family opening presents			2
' i had no reason to believe that she was at any risk			2
there had been a standard routine , there had n’t been any problems with the arrangements			2
i really do n’t know where she is			0
' it looks as though she ’s still in @entity21			0
@entity20 is refusing to say where she is , who she ’s with and he wo n’t say anything other than she ’s in @entity32 yet originally she was in @entity21			0
' he wo n’t give the actual location of where she is			0
he ’s doing this because he has control over me			0
he had sent abusive text messages after our relationship ended and the last control he would have had over me was to hurt me through @entity129 - he knows she ’s everything to me			0
missing : @entity20 claimed he handed @entity37 to a mystery man called @entity84 who took her to @entity32 but an address for the man proved to be false ' i think he would be boasting about what he ’s doing in prison , to make himself feel good about the control he has over us			0
i would do anything to get her back			0
i just want to know where she is , how she is , ' she added			0
' we ’ve been trying to arrange meetings with his family but they do n’t want to communicate with me			0
' the police have tried to ask them for information , but they are n’t willing to cooperate			1
i do n’t know any of his family over in @entity21			0
' i think someone in the community around the family knows something			0
i ’m hoping the information that is known could be given so we know @entity129 is safe , we know she is alive and that she ’s at least settled			1
' it should n’t be a game of control			0
i will be thinking about her on tuesday , thinking about what she ’s doing and who she ’s with			0
she has a loving , doting family waiting for her			0
he should n’t be able to play games with children ’s lives			0
we just want her home			0
' police have launched a fresh appeal for information about @entity37 's whereabouts @entity174 , who has a son from a previous relationship , has been the subject of several civil court actions ordering him to disclose where @entity22 is but he supplied false information			1
he was initially jailed in june 2010 for a maximum two years at the @entity181 of the @entity181 but has subsequently been given three more jail terms the latest imposed in march this year			1
one judge said it was the most ' cynical and cruel ' form of abduction he had dealt with in his 30 year career			1
det con @entity187 of @entity188 said : ' as far as we know , @entity20 has had no contact with @entity129 himself			0
' he ’s never received any letters or photographs of @entity193			0
so there ’s no way that he knows how she is			0
' we ’ve been to see him a few times			0
he maintains the facade she ’s in @entity32 , but there ’s no evidence to support that so we ’re very sceptical			0
' it ’s only him that holds the information			1
' supt @entity206 said : ' we ’re working with a range of international agencies in order to find out who may be harbouring her but it presents its challenges and problems and hopefully this is now the time to tug at heart strings and generate information from the public			1
' we have n’t got any evidence to know she ’s even alive			0
this is the only way he can exert control			0
' he ’s manipulative , he puts himself first			0
he will convince himself that she ’s looked after and cared for but he does n’t know that			0
