@entity5 promised that 90 per cent of all the dresses in the chain ’s new collections will have proper sleeves following criticism a year ago from women shareholders about the dominance of unflattering sleeveless and cap sleeve designs			1
older women have shied away from designs that show their sometimes flabby upper arms , so - called bingo wings , which has been disastrous for @entity6 sales			0
speaking about fulfilling her promise to customers , @entity5 said : ‘ to be absolutely sure that we meet your expectations on this , cap sleeves , which cause much debate have been reclassified as sleeveless			2
so it ’s official , sleeves are in			0

' today , to this venerable list , we can add the name @entity5 , style supremo at @entity6 , whose no - nonsense attitude is about to ensure women will be able to wave at a friend , hail a taxi and enthusiastically applaud a win at the tennis without looking round furtively , then performing said action with elbows firmly planted in ribs , like a trussed chicken			2
' when i previewed @entity5 ’s autumn / winter collection i was so relieved at the re-emergence of the sleeve i would have hugged her , had i not been afraid of squashing my bare , flabby , cellulite - ridden upper arms against her torso			1
' such was my excitement that she then and there promised to add sleeves to 80 per cent of @entity6 ’s garments - and at the agm on tuesday she had added 10 per cent to the figure she gave me in the spring			2
' @entity5 added : ' with such a distinctive array of contemporary trends , the @entity235 / winter 13 collections look set to revitalise the way we dress and inspire an exciting change to our winter wardrobe			1
