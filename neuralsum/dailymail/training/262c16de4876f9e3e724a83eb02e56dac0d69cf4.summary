by @entity0 published : 18:47 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 08:13 est , 22 november 2013 shake - up : health secretary @entity2 announced a string of reforms for the @entity5 this week hospitals have made no improvements in patient safety or care in the three years since the @entity12 scandal , the health watchdog said yesterday			1
in a scathing verdict , the @entity13 said the number of warning notices it had handed to @entity5 trusts for putting patients at risk had more than doubled over the past year			1
and the number of serious problems – including patients not being fed , being left for hours on trolleys or over serious staffing shortages – had risen by a fifth			1
the appalling neglect that cost hundreds of lives at @entity28 from 2005 to 2009 has put hospitals on notice not to repeat the same mistakes			0
but the @entity13 warns they are no better at protecting patients from harm , ensuring they are treated with dignity or respect or in monitoring standards of care			1
in its annual report on the @entity5 – published yesterday – the watchdog states : ‘ in the aftermath of the failures of care at @entity28 , our inspectors ’ biggest concern in 2012/13 was that acute hospitals made no improvement in assessing and monitoring the quality of the care they provided			1
‘ hospitals did not improve their assessment and monitoring of the quality of the care they provided			0
there was also no improvement in safety and safeguarding , or in treating people with dignity and respect			0
‘ we were alarmed to see that there were fewer hospitals where patients were always treated with dignity and their privacy and independence respected			2
’ this week @entity2 announced a string of reforms , including jail for doctors and nurses involved in neglect and fines for hospitals that cover up mistakes			2
example : the appalling neglect that cost hundreds of lives at @entity28 from 2005 to 2009 has put hospitals on notice not to repeat the same mistakes the health secretary admitted that cruelty had been allowed to become ‘ normal ’ in the @entity5 but he promised to transform it into one of the best healthcare systems in the world			2

under fire : chief executive of the @entity5 sir @entity92 has faced calls to resign since the crisis the @entity13 ’s report is based on 35,000 inspections of hospitals , care homes , gp practices and dental surgeries last year			1

dr @entity113 , of the @entity114 , which represents health service managers , said the lack of improvement was disappointing			0
‘ it is absolutely critical that we continue to focus on delivering the highest levels of care and compassion across the entire health system in hospitals , in communities and at home , ’ he added			0
‘ there is no excuse for not treating every patient as an individual , with the highest levels of dignity and respect			0
’ @entity134 of the @entity135 , said : ‘ far too often we have seen decisions based on financial necessity rather than patient need , with services being removed from hospitals while community teams are still pitifully short - staffed			0
