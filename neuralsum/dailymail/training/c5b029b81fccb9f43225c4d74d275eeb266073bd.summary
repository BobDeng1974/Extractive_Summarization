up to 11 party leaders could take part in election debates after @entity3 said @entity5 ’s parties should not be excluded			1
broadcasters last week made a ‘ take it or leave it ’ offer for a seven - way debate between the leaders of the all the major political parties in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
it came after @entity15 threatened to boycott the debates unless the @entity17 were invited to take part alongside @entity3 , the @entity19 and @entity20			1
the province 's first minister , @entity38 leader @entity37 ( right ) , and deputy first minister , @entity40 's @entity39 , could now take part @entity5 's @entity43 mp @entity42 ( left ) and @entity45 leader @entity44 mp ( centre ) may also push to be involved in the debate			1
respect mp @entity48 has also vowed to push for a place the new schedule proposed two debates involving seven leaders – one on @entity53 and one on @entity55 – with a third , on @entity56 and @entity57 , which would be a head - to - head clash between mr @entity15 and @entity26 only			1
along with the @entity60 , @entity3 , @entity19 and @entity20 , tv executives have extended the invitation to the @entity17 , the @entity30 and @entity63 nationalists @entity32			1
@entity3 last week appeared to sign up to the deal – while the @entity60 and @entity19 said they were ‘ considering ’ the proposal			2
but a @entity3 source this evening suggested @entity5 ’s political parties should not be kept out of the debate			1
the source told the website @entity70 : ‘ we can see no good reason to treat @entity72 differently to the rest of the @entity74 in these debates			2
’ if broadcasters accepted the proposal there would be at least eight parties involved – but possibly up to 11 if all @entity5 ’s parties were also invited			1
@entity40 – @entity5 ’s second biggest party – do not take up their seats in @entity83 but have warned they would challenge any attempt to discriminate against them			2
a party spokesman said : ‘ @entity40 will take every opportunity to present and promote its policies and positions			0
’ the @entity38 's leader , @entity5 first minister @entity37 , has written to the broadcasters and @entity92 stating that the proposal is ‘ unacceptable ’			1
the @entity60 pushed for the debates to happen in 2010 , when mr @entity25 was seen to have have triumphed over mr @entity15 and @entity95 @entity96 candidates : @entity15 and @entity26 host : @entity99 @entity53 candidates : @entity15 , @entity26 , @entity25 host : @entity102 @entity55 candidates : @entity15 , @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity33 host : @entity105 @entity96 candidates : @entity15 and @entity26 host : @entity99 @entity53 candidates : @entity15 , @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity33 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity31 host : @entity102 @entity55 candidates : @entity15 , @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity33 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity31 host : @entity105 he said : ‘ in light of the extension of the debates to smaller and regional parties , the failure of the broadcasters to invite the @entity38 to participate is inexplicable			1
‘ the broadcasters ' decision can not logically or legally be defended			0
@entity48 , the @entity122 ’s sole mp , has also demanded his inclusion			0
mr @entity33 , who had been the main beneficiary of the original format proposed by the broadcasters , said the revised offer had made the programmes less likely to take place			0
‘ you ca n't have a debate with seven people on the podium			0
and if you are going to have seven , you have got to have the @entity5 @entity38 , they are after all the fourth biggest party in @entity83 , ’ he told @entity129			1
‘ the broadcasters made a decision , @entity92 backed that decision up : there are four major parties in @entity74 politics			2
‘ mr @entity15 , i 'm afraid , has managed to upset the whole debate , to dilute the thing			2
and i think these debates are now looking less likely to happen than they were before			0
’ the @entity145 had thrown scheduling plans into chaos after refusing to take part unless @entity150 leader @entity28 was offered a place at the podium			0
her inclusion put pressure on @entity155 to agree to the debates – even though ongoing unrest among other smaller and regional parties threatens to scupper the screenings altogether			0
broadcasters said they had made the changes after reviewing the ‘ electoral landscape ’ but issued a clear warning that they would ‘ empty chair ’ any leader who refused to turn up			0
the original proposal was for one debate featuring the @entity145 and @entity26 , a second including mr @entity25 and a third with the addition of @entity20 leader @entity33			1
the row over the exclusion of the @entity172 has sparked an apparent surge in support for the party , which saw it pick up several points in the polls and thousands of new members			0
leader miss @entity28 described the decision to include her party as ‘ groundbreaking ’ and the apparent surge in support as a ‘ @entity184 ’			0
the group of major broadcasters said that since the initial proposal they had monitored ‘ the electoral landscape ’ and taken into account polling data and ‘ expressions of public support for the debates to go ahead and for a wider range of parties to be included in the debates ’			2
the proposed dates for the debates are april 2 , 16 and 30 – with the final clash exactly a week ahead of the @entity201 poll on may 7 .			0

broadcasters agreed to @entity15 's demand for a role for the @entity172
new plan saw one tv battle between @entity15 and @entity26
@entity53 and @entity55 would then host separate debates with seven - *strong* line - up
this would include @entity13 's @entity32 and the @entity30
tv chiefs say debates will go ahead with or without @entity15 and @entity25
but minor parties are *furious* over snub - including @entity220 and the @entity38
now @entity3 say ' no reason ' why @entity5 should be excluded
