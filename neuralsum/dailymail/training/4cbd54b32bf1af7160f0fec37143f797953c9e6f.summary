@entity2 ’s foreign aid budget worth £ 11billion should be immediately suspended with the money diverted to help areas in the @entity2 devastated by flooding , @entity0 said today			1
the @entity7 leader insisted ‘ charity begins at home ’ and urged the government to step up its response to the colossal damage to homes , businesses , roads and railways			1
the call came as @entity18 was again forced to defend the government ’s response from claims ministers have been slow to act and ill - prepared , even turning up to flood hit areas without wellington boots			1
@entity7 leader @entity0 insisted ' charity begins at home ' and demanded foreign aid money be redirected to help communities hit by flooding flood waters have risen over night in @entity30 , @entity31 , where residents have been advised to evacuate their homes heavy rain and gale force winds continue to batter much of southern @entity2 today , with new warnings of further flooding			1
homes across much of the @entity39 have been evacuated while ministers are drawing up an emergency plan to repair a vital rail link at @entity43 near @entity44 after its collapse when huge waves whipped up by high winds smashed a 100ft section of sea wall			0
communities secretary @entity50 today announced an extra £ 30million for this year and £ 100million next year to pay for repairs , urgent work in @entity31 extra maintenance			1
but mr @entity0 insisted it was not enough			0
he said : ‘ anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that a government ’s primary duty is to the well - being of its own citizens			1
charity begins at home and it is not mean - spirited to say that , it is just basic common sense			0
‘ the amount of damage caused by the floods and storms across a large swathe of the south west and other regions too is colossal			1
‘ yet the government ’s response is both lethargic and inadequate			1
people would be forgiven for thinking that they do n’t really care and that ordinary @entity2 families are not their priority			0
’ residents in @entity30 have been advised to evacuate their homes , as floods continue to cause chaos high tide strikes again at the @entity43 train station in @entity83 where the train line has been exposed by the wild storm @entity18 today leapt to the defence of his minister who visited flood - hit areas in black polished shoes			1
the prime minister rejected claims that environment secretary @entity93 had arrived in @entity31 dressed like he was going to the @entity94			1
mr @entity18 said : ' i completely disagree with what you said about @entity93 who knows a lot about rural issues and the countryside			1
' he sits for a rural seat , he was absolutely on top of those flooding issues			0
' he went to visit the floods			2
he was not dressed as if he was going to the @entity94			0
he was dressed as if he was going to floods			2
' he had a pair of wellies but because he was harassed as soon as he got out of the car he did n’t have a chance to put them on			2
' the government and the @entity112 have faced mounting criticism for the handling of the floods and the response as more rain and high winds swept across the country			1
today mr @entity18 was forced to defend his response during an interview on @entity122			1
he insisted : ‘ we have been very pro-active we have an emergency planning system in government called cobra which we called on straight away			2
‘ we ’ve been planning this across government			2
i chair a meeting yesterday which has everyone around the table , the police , the fire service , the local authorities , all ready to help with whatever we can			0
’ but the prime minister was critical of the @entity112 's decision to cut back on dredging rivers over the past two decades			1
' the fact is , since the @entity112 was founded in the late 1990s , it took a view - and increasingly other organisations took a view - that dredging was n't appropriate , ' he said			0
' i think that 's wrong			2
i have a constituency that does flood frequently			0
i pushed for dredging and some dredging has taken place and it does make a difference			0
' we 've got to make sure that our system is focused on protecting people above all else , so some of the arguments against dredging have to be taken on and we need to start dredging again more systematically			0
the @entity112 now accepts that			0
' he added : ' the scale of these weather events and the scale of the flooding has shifted even more something that was beginning to shift anyway			0
the @entity112 had taken a very anti-dredging view for many years			0
that was beginning to change and now it 's changing faster , and that 's something i welcome			2
' @entity171 revealed the army could be called in to help rebuild the @entity43 railways line in @entity83 .			0
