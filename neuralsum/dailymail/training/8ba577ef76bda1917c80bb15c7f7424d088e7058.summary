the ordeal was photographed by 62 - year - old mr @entity13 , who moved to @entity107 from @entity165 , as he feared his daughter my never see her children alive again			1

' i looked at the firefighters and said , " i have to go to @entity116 and the kids " , ' he told the @entity215			0
' for the next two - and - a - half hours , we huddled under the jetty as the fire intensified and produced a plume of smoke , ash and debris that left us with very little oxygen			2

i was able to scoop some water onto the jetty and put it out			0
