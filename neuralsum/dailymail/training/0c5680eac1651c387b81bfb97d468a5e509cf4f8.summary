a new interactive map lets users nuke any location in the world with a nuclear bomb of their choosing			1
the @entity6 uses @entity8 images to simulate the nuclear attack and bases the animations on how mushroom clouds have behaved using information from various nuclear tests since the 1940s			1
users can select a location , choose their weapon and their viewing location , and see the bomb drop and the cloud develop			1
the altitude of the cloud , how far it spreads and the number of casualties is also shown			2
click the map below to nuke a city the @entity6 uses @entity8 images to simulate the nuclear attack and bases the animations on how mushroom clouds have behaved during various tests since the 1940s			1
users can select a location , choose their weapon and their viewing location , and see the bomb drop and the cloud develop real - time			1
the altitude of the cloud , how far it spreads and the number of casualties is also shown			0
casualty numbers are based on how many people live in that region and their various distances from ground zero			1
@entity43 is the third in a series of nuclear bombing simulators created by historian @entity46 from the @entity47 in @entity48			0
according to @entity46 , the map was designed to provide a visual and accurate simulation of what would happen if a nuclear bomb was dropped on any city in the world			0
it was also created to give people a better understanding of how it would affect their hometowns or places they are familiar with			0
and the map can highlight the varying levels of nuclear bombs and their respective threat			1
@entity46 said on his blog : ' we live in a world where nuclear weapons issues are on the front pages of our newspapers on a regular basis , yet most people still have a very bad sense of what an exploding nuclear weapon can actually do			0
' casualty numbers quoted on @entity6 are based on how many people live in that region and their various distances from ground zero			1
this image shows the cloud from a 10 kiloton blast on @entity84 , as seen from @entity86 harbour			2
the @entity6 lets you change location , the size of the bomb and the viewing location this population information was bought by the @entity93 at the @entity47			1
the behaviour of the clouds is based on equations by @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , i. @entity101 , and @entity102 , as well as @entity103 , written in february 1953 , and @entity105 and @entity106 's @entity104 , 1964 edition			0
the bombs nukemap users can choose from include a @entity111 bomb tested in october 2006 as well as the ' little boy ' @entity114 bomb and the ' @entity115 ' - the largest known pure fission weapon ever tested			2
if a 20kt nuclear bomb was dropped on @entity119 , pictured , the cloud altitude could reach 7,210m			2
it could cause 11,950 deaths and 42,750 injuries each bomb is shown with its relative yield in tonnes or kilotonnes , which determines the size and impact of the nuke			0
@entity46 adds that all of the information used to create the @entity43 is publicly available and does n't provide any secret data			0
he defends the map against critics who claim the site could be used by terrorists by saying : ' if we get to the point where a terrorist group is asking , ' where should i set off my nuclear weapon that i have ? ' then we 've already gone past the point of no return			2
there 's no way to avert a catastrophe at that point			0
' because the @entity6 uses @entity8 images , users must have the @entity8 plug - in installed on their browser to use the map			1
previous versions of the @entity6 use @entity153 but do n't have the 3d animations of the @entity43			2
this map created by nuclear weapon historian @entity46 demonstrates the fallout caused by 2.3 megaton bomb dropped on @entity159			0
it was modeled on the @entity162 weapons held during the @entity163 of the 1960s			0

the @entity6 uses @entity8 images to simulate nuclear bombings
users can select the location and size of the bombs
