@entity1 's culture minister has provoked a cry of disbelief after admitting that she has n't read a single book over the past two years			1
to add to her embarrassment , @entity5 was also unable to say on a tv show which book by @entity1 's new @entity9 winner @entity8 was her favourite , just minutes after having said she had lunched with the author			1
only two weeks ago , she had hailed @entity8 as representing the ' influence and vitality of @entity1 literature in the eyes of the world			0
' sacre bleu ! @entity1 culture minister @entity5 ( left ) has admitted that she has n't read a single book in the past two years and did n't know any by @entity1 's new @entity9 winner @entity8 ( right ) ' i admit without any problem that i have had no time to read over the past two years , ' she went on to say , referring to her time in government first as minister for innovation and the digital economy and now as culture minister			1
' i read a lot of notes , i read a lot of legislative documents , i read a lot of news , @entity27 ( news agency ) stories ... but i read very little			0
' her admission sent @entity38 ablaze , with many shocked by the fact that a culture minister had not read books for two years and did not know any of @entity8 's books			1
' long live our brilliant government and especially culture , ' said one @entity38 user with the handle @ @entity48			1
honoured : @entity8 was named the 111th winner of the @entity50 for literature earlier this month but others leapt to her defence or ridiculed the controversy			2
' the worst thing is that if @entity5 had said she spent her evenings reading , many would have blamed her for not working enough , ' said @ intwittoveritas			0
' @entity1 is finally facing up to its main problem in this period of deep crisis : @entity5 has not read @entity8 , ' joked @ @entity62			2
@entity8 , 69 , was named the 111th winner of the @entity50 for literature earlier this month , taking home the £ 700,000 award			0
he is perhaps best known for his 1978 novel @entity66 , for which he won the prestigious @entity69 @entity1 literature prize			0
@entity5 , 41 , was born in @entity70 but adopted by a @entity1 family at six months old after being abandoned on the streets of @entity73			2
she took over the post of culture minister from @entity76 in august and is seen as more progressive on issues such as technology .			0

@entity5 also could n't name novel by @entity1 's new @entity50 winner
her admission *prompted* wave of *exasperation* from shocked @entity38 users
one *tweeted* : ' long live our brilliant government and especially culture '
