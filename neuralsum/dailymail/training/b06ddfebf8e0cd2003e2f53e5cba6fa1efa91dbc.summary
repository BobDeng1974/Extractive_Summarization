@entity1 's already tight housing market just got another squeeze after a tiny former earthquake shelter sold for $ 765,000 in october			1
according to @entity4 , the 330 - square - foot shack that sits on a quiet street in @entity7 is one of the surviving properties built for earthquake victims in 1906			1
the @entity11 built the shacks in public spaces to house some of the 250,000 people displaced by the fires and quakes that struck the city			2
shocking : a 330 - square foot ' shack ' in @entity1 sold for $ 765,000 , which was $ 100,000 over the asking price floorplan : the design utilizes the space to create the illusion of separate dining and living rooms to give the home an open feel once those camps started to close , the @entity27 allowed families to take the homes with them , on the condition they hauled them away themselves , which most did with the help of a mule or two			1
that does n't mean that the new buyer is going to be living in a dilapidated shack , as this hardy home has been kept in great shape over the century it 's stood in the city			0
its previous owner , an artist based in the city , recently renovated the interior , managing to economize the space without making it feel small			2
roomy : the emergency shelters were built after the @entity50 in 1906 and designed as simple shelters renovation : many still survive , and have been given a modern update in order to keep their avant garde homeowners happy space : a recent renovation by the artist that owns the home tries to be economical with space without squeezing too tight up the staircase is where the new owner has their semi-enclosed bedroom , and a walk - in closet provides some storage space			0
when the inside starts to feel like too much of a squeeze , there 's an adjoining patio and a porch that 's as pint - sized as the home			0
@entity1 's housing market has experienced some overheating during the last few years , as @entity79 's employees have snapped up the limited amount of real estate			0
living room : the space might not be enough to throw a rager , but an open floor plan gives it a great atmosphere for an intimate gathering cozy up : the semi-enclosed bedroom up a flight of stairs may not be to everyone 's taste , but for some it will truly feel like home storage : a rolling door gives the walk - in closet a little more breathing room in spite of the low ceilings space at the top stretch out : when living in the small shack gets to be too tight , homeowners have a patio and a small elevated porch according to the real estate site @entity109 , the median price of a home sold in the city is $ 979,000 , having hovered around $ 1million since it broke that record back in 2013			1
if you still have your heart set on one of the city 's emergency shelters - cum - luxury properties , @entity111 reports that a $ 1.15million shack in @entity118 went on the market earlier in the year			2
this one has a bit more space , with a garage , two full floors and ample room on the patio , as well as a solarium .			0
