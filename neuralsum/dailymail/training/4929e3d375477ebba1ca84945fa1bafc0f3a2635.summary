@entity11 pledged before coming to power to seek a two - year extension to the deadline for implementing unpopular cuts demanded in exchange for two massive international aid packages worth 240 billion euros that are keeping @entity4 afloat			1
but delays in implementing reforms and austerity measures have fueled impatience in @entity9 - the largest single contributor to the bailouts - and other eurozone countries			0
