fifty - six minutes gone at @entity2 , a @entity1 move breaks down and @entity3 brings the ball out of defence			1
he gives the ball to @entity7 , on to @entity8 , and then @entity9 virtually on the centre spot receives it			2
he ’s on the half turn looking to get forward but is quickly closed down so lays it back to @entity3 , and offers himself again			0
@entity14 gives him the ball , @entity9 moves forward and taps it back to @entity14 who runs into the space @entity9 created			1
again the @entity20 man wants it back , but @entity14 ’s pass is careless and @entity1 take up possession			1
there is a real threat because @entity26 is miles up the pitch			0
as @entity28 lost the ball he stood and watched and then decided to trot back			2
@entity9 sees the danger straightaway and as @entity31 passes out to the left to @entity33 , he sprints into the right back position and launches a perfectly timed tackle to snuff out the danger			2
quiet night : @entity9 struggled in front of goal against @entity1 but still put in a committed performance getting stuck in : @entity9 slides in on @entity1 's @entity33 during friday 's 3 - 0 win at @entity2 frustrated figure : @entity9 was deployed behind @entity41 as @entity42 persisted with a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation that tackle happened right in front of where i was sitting with my son watching the game and it had to be perfectly timed			1
get that one slightly wrong and it ’s a yellow card			0
if that happens at a @entity53 , it could prove costly			2
as the ball hit the advertising hoardings @entity26 sauntered into the penalty area			0
now i ca n’t say @entity9 had a great game			2
going forward it just did n’t happen for him at all			0
and a great tackle wo n’t save him from another disappointing @entity53 if he does n’t create and score for @entity28 in @entity62			1
but what i want to see from @entity28 players , even when they ’re not playing well , is commitment , and that tackle showed why people are so wrong to call for @entity9 to be dropped			1
when i read @entity68 describing @entity9 as the ' weak link ' on @entity70 last week i was shocked			2
the former @entity72 and @entity73 striker is right that @entity9 has n’t delivered at a @entity53 , but he ’s only the weak link if he offers less than the rest			1
at his best @entity9 is a hard - working goalscorer and a creator			1
at his worst he is a team player			0
@entity9 does n’t deserve the criticism			0
he has earned the right with performances and goals for his club and country for us all to debate how to get the best out of him , rather than lazily writing him off			0
the problem @entity9 has is that because he is so good at everything , his true strength is overlooked			0
he is a goalscorer – a goal machine			0
check out how brilliant @entity9 was in the 2011 - 12 @entity93 season for @entity20			1
he scored 34 goals in 43 games , back - to - back @entity93 hat - tricks , the first when he was man of the match in @entity20 ’s record - breaking 8 - 2 demolition of @entity100			2
he was an out - and - out striker at that point			0
a change of position , playing a deeper role , has led to some doubting his @entity20 credentials			0
rested : @entity9 is replaced by @entity107 midfielder @entity106 after 66 minutes on friday night danger man : @entity41 continued his good form with a stunning strike against @entity1 familiar sight : @entity41 has become @entity28 's main goal threat after a standout season for @entity107 same with @entity28 – he is well on the way to breaking sir @entity116 ’s goalscoring record			1
but in the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , he plays behind lone striker and has become less of a goal threat			1
@entity28 have two fantastic centre forwards in @entity41 and @entity9 , play them both up front , put a diamond behind them – with @entity8 deep , @entity106 at the point , @entity123 or @entity7 on one side and @entity14 on the other , and you have a better chance of getting the very best out of @entity9 who let ’s not forget is , on his day , @entity28 ’s best player			1
problem is he does n’t have enough of those days and he has n’t had any of them at a @entity53			0

@entity9 was played behind @entity41 in @entity28 's 3 - 0 win against @entity1 on friday
the @entity20 failed to score and struggled to make an impact in the final third
@entity9 's form has been criticised recently but he remains the @entity28 ' best player
the 28 - year - old needs to be played further forward if he 's to find his best form at the @entity53
