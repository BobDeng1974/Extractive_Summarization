the @entity1 row took a sensational turn last night after a police constable said the former @entity5 minister he claims called him a ‘ f * * * * * * pleb ’ must pay him up to £ 200,000 damages , and be gagged from speaking out			1
@entity10 @entity9 , who claims he was abused by former chief whip @entity11 when he refused to let him cycle through the @entity14 gates , has tabled his astonishing demands in court documents obtained by @entity17			1
speaking out for the first time since the incident in 2012 , the police officer insists mr @entity11 did use the term ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’ – and in a dramatic twist , implies mr @entity11 apologised for using the words			1
@entity26 claims : @entity10 @entity9 , left , intends to launch a £ 200,000 libel suit against former chief whip @entity11 , right , claiming that he called him a ' f * * * * * * pleb ' when he asked for the gates of @entity14 to be opened for him in september 2012 he says mr @entity11 phoned him to say sorry afterwards ‘ with the clear implication he admitted using the said words ’ – but later repeatedly lied about it to try to save his career			1
it is the first time anyone has suggested mr @entity11 owned up to calling no 10 police ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’			1
the former minister , who was forced to resign from the @entity41 as a result , has already stated that he rang @entity43 to apologise for ‘ using @entity45 language ’			2
but he has never admitted he called him a ‘ f * * * * * * pleb ’			1
now @entity48 is demanding up to £ 200,000 in ‘ aggravated damages for slander ’ and has asked the court to grant an injunction to ‘ restrain ’ mr @entity11 , and anyone acting on his behalf , from repeating his claim that @entity9 fabricated the allegation			1
as he fought to clear his name mr @entity11 has been aided by @entity5 mp @entity58 and senior @entity60 figures such as @entity61 , chairman of the @entity62			2
@entity48 ’s request for an injunction would appear to extend to them and would mean they would also be silenced by court order			2
both mr @entity58 and mr @entity61 would almost certainly refuse			0
in theory , the gag could apply to mr @entity11 ’s wife , @entity68 , a family doctor who has vigorously defended her husband			1
conversely there are those who believe that mr @entity11 ’s ability to call on the help of friends in high places has given him an unfair advantage in his battle with @entity48			1
the bombshell new claims are contained in a statement of more than 10,000 words by @entity43 to the @entity26 , setting out his libel claim against mr @entity11			1
it says @entity43 wants ‘ damages including aggravated damages for libel , and if appropriate , slander ’			2
he also wants ‘ an injunction to restrain [ @entity88 ] whether by himself , his servants , agents or otherwise howsoever , from further publishing or causing the publication of the same or similar words defamatory to the claimant			0
’ the controversial nature of parts of his statement are bound to raise the temperature in the breakdown in police relations with the government as a result of @entity102			0
one policeman has been jailed for falsely claiming he witnessed the incident , three others face @entity106 disciplinary hearings this week over other misconduct allegations			0
and the @entity109 has been accused of using @entity1 to undermine the government ’s attempts to reform the police			0
@entity43 ’s counter claims against mr @entity11 , his demand for up to £ 200,000 , and a gag on an mp , could further inflame tensions			1
the stakes could not be higher : @entity43 claims mr @entity11 falsely accused him of ‘ dishonesty and corruption ’ and ‘ humiliated ’ him			1
@entity120 is keen to restore mr @entity11 to the @entity41 – but he has no chance of doing that if he loses the libel case to @entity43			1
the former international development minister last night stood by his claim that he never said ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’			2
he told @entity17 : ‘ i have always made clear that the police account of what happened that night is untrue			0
thanks to good investigative journalism much of the truth has already come out			0
‘ there are ten police officers facing some form of misconduct inquiries for what they did and one has gone to jail , with three gross misconduct hearings taking place in @entity142 , starting tomorrow			0
my legal defence to these allegations will be filed shortly			0
’ @entity43 says he wrote down mr @entity11 ’s ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’ alleged comment in his notebook 90 minutes after the event and immediately emailed it to senior officers			1
@entity9 also says : until now , @entity43 , 43 , has not uttered a word in public since the incident 19 months ago			0
@entity9 ’s lawyer @entity154 states : ‘ the claimant ( @entity9 ) can not say how much he expects to recover , save that he does not expect the amount in damages to exceed £ 200,000			2
’ @entity9 ’s ‘ statement of claims ’ filed to the court , declares : ‘ on the evening of 19 september the claimant , on duty in @entity14 , declined to open the main gate to allow the defendant to pass through with his bicycle , explaining it would be against security policy			2
‘ the claimant opened the pedestrian side gate for the claimant			0
the defendant said to the claimant : “ @entity174 learn your f * * * * * * place – you do n’t run this f * * * * * * government , you ’re f * * * * * * plebs			0
” ’ the alleged comments were leaked to the press and mr @entity11 was forced to resign as international development secretary			2
but he claimed he did not utter the ‘ toxic phrase ’ , joked about @entity43 ’s ‘ alleged logbook ’ and said he was the victim of a police ‘ stitch up ’			1
@entity43 says it meant mr @entity11 had accused him of ‘ fabricating the damning allegation that [ @entity11 ] had called @entity9 and / or police “ f * * * * * * plebs ” ’			1
justifying his demand for up to £ 200,000 damages , @entity9 ’s lawyer declares : ‘ he has been very seriously injured in his personal and professional reputation and suffered great distress , humiliation and upset			1
’ mr @entity11 ’s allegations ‘ could not be more serious for a serving officer , let along one engaged in protecting members of the government			1
the impact on his career could be devastating			0
’ @entity11 was ‘ well aware how serious it was to make such allegations ... he knew were baseless ’			0
@entity43 says : ‘ initially [ @entity11 ] did not allege [ @entity9 ] had lied			2
in fact he apologised [ to @entity9 ] privately by phone not long after the incident			0
‘ the clear implication was that he admitted to using the said words			0
’ mr @entity58 said last night : ‘ the idea a policeman can ask for £ 200,000 damages from an elected member of parliament , ask a judge to gag them and to gag any other @entity217 or friends and relatives who wish to speak up freely for them , undermines the very democracy the police are supposed to safeguard			1
’ @entity11 ’s claim that he is the victim of an orchestrated police smear campaign will receive a boost this week when three officers face gross misconduct hearings over their role in the saga			1
the cases have been brought as a result of @entity232 , the @entity234 investigation into @entity102			0
two officers have already lost their jobs as a result : @entity10 @entity238 , who was sacked from the force and sentenced to 12 months in prison for fabricating a witness statement purporting to be from a member of the public ; and pc @entity244 , who was fired for leaking pc @entity9 ’s ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’ version of events to @entity245 now two women and one man , all from the @entity253 , face the prospect of further disciplinary action			1
the first hearing , tomorrow , is for an unnamed constable accused of forwarding @entity43 ’s log to @entity259			0
two further hearings will be held for a pc accused of falsely claiming not to have been in contact with @entity238 , and for a constable accused of giving false statements to @entity232			0
both women have been suspended from duty , while the male officer has been on restricted duties			0
the fake email sent by @entity238 to @entity269 mp , the government ’s deputy chief whip , proved fatal to mr @entity11 ’s career because it appeared to offer independent corroboration of the police log version of events			1
it purported to come from a member of the public present outside the gates , and claimed that the incident had been witnessed by other tourists			0
@entity120 rang mr @entity11 after reading the email and told him to quit the @entity41			2
mr @entity11 has said that the emergence of the email was ‘ the worst moment of my life ’ , adding : ‘ suddenly i realised i was being stitched up			2
i knew it was false but i did n’t know what to do			0
i realised something terrible was happening to me over which i had no control			0
’ mr @entity11 was given the nickname ‘ @entity290 ’ at school , and some say his reputation for high - handedness was why not all @entity5 mps immediately rowed in behind him when the controversy broke			1
one said : ‘ @entity11 can have quite an off - hand manner about him at times			0
’ mr @entity11 has continuously maintained he is the victim of a smear campaign			1
‘ if this can happen to a senior government minister , then what chance would a youth in @entity301 or @entity302 have ? ’ he has said			0
mr @entity11 admitted swearing ‘ in exasperation ’ but always denied losing his temper			1
@entity308 to mr @entity11 ’s argument is @entity310 footage , released in december 2012 , which cast doubt on the police account by showing only a brief interaction between @entity11 and the officer – and no tourists			1
he received a further boost in october 2013 after a report from the @entity318 concluded three officers had given a false account of a meeting they had with @entity11 at his constituency office in october 2012 , and that the findings of a subsequent investigation had been changed at the 11th hour to recommend no disciplinary action be taken			0
that prompted mr @entity120 to call for mr @entity11 to receive an apology over the incident			2
the officers issued a statement in which they apologised for misleading the public			0
although this week ’s disciplinary hearings will be held in private , mr @entity11 has been invited to attend .			2

@entity335 breaks silence in sensational twist to ' @entity1 ' row between police and former **cabinet** minister
he claims former chief whip @entity11 changed his story over *confrontation* with @entity14 officers
*testimony* from @entity48 even implies mr @entity11 and admitted using the insult , then denied to it salvage career
court papers seen by the @entity17 show that @entity43 insists mr @entity11 did call him a ' f * * * * * * pleb '
but former **cabinet** minister mr @entity11 stands by his claim , and insists that the police have lied , not him
he had nothing to do with any plot to ‘ stitch up ’ mr @entity11 .
mr @entity11 launched a ‘ wholly gratuitous attack ’ on him accusing him of ‘ dishonesty and corruption ’ to *deflect* attention from a law chiefs ’ ruling that the pc says rejected mr @entity11 ’s version of events .
his demand for up to £ 200,000 damages is justified by the way mr @entity11 ‘ humiliated ’ him and his family .
