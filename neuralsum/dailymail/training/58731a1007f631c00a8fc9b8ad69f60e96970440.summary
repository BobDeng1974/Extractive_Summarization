a close - knit family , with an urge to return to their @entity3 roots , have given up their beach - side @entity6 luxury life and sold everything they own in order to move into a run - down @entity13 castle			1
the @entity15 family , from @entity16 in @entity6 's northern beaches , have taken it upon themselves to restore a romantic 14th century @entity13 chateau to its former glory and share it with romantics everywhere by transforming it into an affordable boutique hotel			1
@entity15 told @entity25 that she and her husband , their three children , their son in law and two of their grandchildren have been sleeping on air - mattresses since arriving at the @entity34 in the south west of @entity13 two and a half months ago			1
the @entity15 family , from @entity16 in northern @entity6 , have moved into the @entity34 in the south west of @entity13 @entity15 ( left ) told @entity25 that she and her husband , their three children , their son in law and two of their grandchildren ( right ) arrived at their new home two and a half months ago the family of gyprock workers , who bought the property for two million euros and set aside another million for the renovation , are entirely dedicated to turning the 20 acres of land and its buildings into the romantic fairy - tale it once was , but they have a lot of hard work ahead of them			1
' it was n't quite like the advertisement			2
the outside has been a bit of challenge – i 'm not a gardener and this is like having a garden or steroids , ' mrs @entity55 said			0
' initially , it was the complete opposite of what we were expecting			2
the outside is completely overgrown – you could n't see the outhouses and the summer house was also completely overgrown			2
' it sits on 20 acres , so there 's a lot of clearing			1
there 's these horrible thorny bushes called brambles and they 're taller than me so we 've had to get a lot of heavy duty tools to cut and slice through them			2
we also have to put in a new septic tank			0
they will spend the next few years restoring the castle and its 20 acres of land and turn it into a romantic boutique hotel mrs @entity55 said she and her family uncover the chateau 's historical secrets each day			1
pictured : the original 13th century staircase in the main tower which remains in a ' superb condition ' for its age ' so , all that is happening at the moment and we still have to throw all this stuff out before winter comes so that we can work on the inside			1
' within , the 16 bedroom , two - story castle has also suffered extensive damage and minor deteriorations through ageing , and will require a great amount of re-patching and restoring			1
' inside , the ground floor was the worst , because they have n't cut the tress away for some time it got very damp and so there 's a lot of rotten panelling and plaster – but all the problems are just cosmetic			1
the building is still sound , ' mrs @entity55 said			0
underneath the cracked paint and peeling plaster , mrs @entity55 said that the @entity34 's history continues to peek through the more they clear			0
the front part of the dovery on the property which has had the wild shrubs recently cleared up the original tiling on the bottom floor of the castle ( left ) and the original condition horse stables ( right ) ' we know that it was built in 1301 and that because it 's by the river traders used to come here to pay their pass so they could trade at the time			2
i also know that an @entity137 sailor married into royalty and they lived in the chateau , ' mrs @entity55 said			2
' but there is a big gap in the history of is ownership , right in the middle			0
a family lived here just before the [ second world ] war , and the gardener and chauffer lived in the cottages , but after that we do n't know			1
a lot of things were taken over by the @entity155 at the time , especially big houses and castles , but we do n't know what happened or who moved in			1
' she said the family keep discovering more and more as they continue to fix up the castle , including the original stables , winding circular staircase and cellar			0
' we found stuff everywhere			0
the ground floor has the original floor tiles and they 're beautiful and still completely intact			0
we also found through cutting back all the shrubberies , the water tower and wells are all originals			0
there 's also a laundry which has a sunken floor where the water came in and they washed inside a big bath tub - the whole room is like a paddling pool - and the old taps are still there , ' mrs @entity55 said			1
the @entity15 family have started their restoration from the outside and are currently taming the wild bushes and plants that have become overgrown once winter arrives , mrs @entity55 said the family will begin to work on restoring the inside of the chateau and its outhouses ' a lot of the walls inside – they used to put materials on the wall , not plaster , and some have been hand painted so we are going to have someone come in and restore them and clean them			1
' by may 2015 , mrs @entity55 and her extended family plan to have a small sectionof their 16 bedroom hotel ready for the public ' we 're eventually going to have the oldest part of the building - the first thing ever built , which is the tower – made into a wedding bridal suite , but because there 's six bedroom in the whole tower we 'd like to offer it to their families as well , so they can have everyone stay in the area			1
and just on that side at the bottom we have an old chapel , so we want to offer for people to get married there , ' she said			0
' all the other rooms will be suits that can accommodate families			0
we also have a lot of land we ca n't touch so we are thinking of building a golf course on that in the future and we 're going to build a swimming pool just near the summer house too			1
' built in 1301 , the @entity13 castle has a mysterious and long history			2
it is not known who owned the property after the second world war before and after : ' the old pump house and water tower , it was a challenge but definitely worth it ! ' the family wrote on their @entity250 page the other 19 outhouses on the property will be built into homes for mrs @entity55 , her children and grandchildren so that ' the whole family is together '			0
nearby , the closest town is @entity34 , with a population of 260 people and so small that mrs @entity55 said ' if you blink you 'll miss it '			0
' the mayor lives down the road from us and everyone is so supportive because this it the biggest thing they have and it has been neglected for so long – they call it @entity266 and now she 's finally alive and kicking			0
' the property will eventually also include a gold coarse and a large swimming pool for hotel guests although they 've left everything and everyone behind and even have had to learn @entity13 from scratch , mrs @entity55 says she and her family regret nothing although they 've left everything and everyone behind and even have had to learn @entity13 from scratch , mrs @entity55 says she regrets nothing			1
' in the beginning it was very exciting and as the time to move came closer and you get rid of your furniture and you 're jobless , homeless and car-less , it 's very scary and you panic because you think " is it the right thing to do ? " ' she said			0
' but even with the really hard work , and we have got a lot in front of us , i still have no regrets at all			2
' every time you come up that lovely driveway it takes your breath away and you go " yeh , i did the right thing "			0

the @entity15 family , from @entity16 in @entity6 , left their beach - side life for the @entity13 *countryside* two months ago
