they like to play a bit of @entity2 at @entity4 ’s little home in the minutes before their matches start			1
they might be better served singing @entity7			0
only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of @entity4 ’s afternoon engagement with @entity12			1
in sequence , they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2 - 2 draw			1
they are neither up nor down ; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot			0
how delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of @entity22 football that a team unbeaten in 10 before saturday ’s kick - off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose			1
@entity28 converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for @entity12 at @entity31 @entity28 celebrates his late , late strike as the @entity33 held @entity4 to a draw on their home turf the battle for automatic promotion to the @entity38 is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play			1
1 @entity42 85pts to play apr 25 @entity43 ( a ) , may 2 @entity12 ( h ) 2 @entity4 84pts apr 27 @entity45 ( h ) , may 2 @entity44 ( a ) 3 @entity46 84pts apr 25 @entity47 ( a ) , may 2 @entity43 ( h ) 4 @entity48 82pts apr 25 @entity49 ( a ) , may 2 @entity47 ( h ) and how			2
they dominated , then they trailed , then they levelled and had a man sent off			0
then their fans got mocked by a wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again			1
how significantly will @entity28 of wednesday feature in @entity4 ’s final analysis ? how serious was @entity65 when he indicated that the referees feel @entity4 , at 15 kicks , have reached their quota for penalties this season ? he was unhappy , to put it mildly , that @entity72 was cleared of fouling @entity73 in the second half , telling a radio station : ‘ it looked like the referees have come together and talked about @entity73 and said , “ do n’t give him any penalties because @entity4 have had too many this season and we do n’t want them to have any more ”			1
’ @entity82 ( second right ) celebrates with his team after his 36th minute header put the visitors ahead he toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best			1
@entity65 is a good and rational man ; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all @entity90 coaches			2
a sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race , then ? who could blame him if it was ? @entity46 had beaten @entity48 on friday night to take @entity4 ’s place at the top and at 3.36pm on saturday @entity82 put wednesday in front			1
when @entity100 scored a magnificent volley for @entity42 against @entity102 — the only goal of the match — @entity42 were top and @entity4 were third			2
then @entity106 equalised , lifting @entity4 back up to second , and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman			1
senses take leave at this time of a season , which might also explain how @entity112 quickly landed himself a second yellow card			0
@entity28 turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes			2
alas , @entity116 then hit the top corner and put @entity4 top again but in stoppage time @entity119 fouled @entity121 for a penalty			1
‘ no - one will blame @entity119 , ’ @entity65 said			1
‘ we will tell him how much we love him tonight			0
’ @entity106 ( second left equalises for the @entity124 with 20 minutes of the contest remaining @entity4 's @entity112 is dismissed by referee @entity126 in the 78th minute which is nice , though @entity28 did score the penalty and @entity4 did fall			1
@entity65 said he felt ‘ heartbroken ’			2
over the course of two spells at @entity4 he has led them from @entity132 to this precipice , occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke			2
today , in their tiny stadium where parking costs £ 1 and stewards are encouraged to say hello , they are so close to something incredible			0
@entity140 , @entity4 ’s captain , gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through			2
‘ he is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit , ’ he said			0
‘ we realise how much he does for us			0
when a single person gives that much of their life towards you , you only want to repay them			0
’ but the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this			0
promotion is worth somewhere in the region of £ 120million and , as of the weekend , eight teams are in the hunt for three spots			0
multiple narratives , multiple charges and multiple futures on the line			0
it ’s crazy but it ’s brilliant			0
with only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill			0
@entity116 races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time			1

@entity4 are now second in the *championship* following their draw
@entity65 hits out at referee after his side give up lead in stoppage time
@entity82 fired wednesday into the lead with a 36th minute header
@entity106 equalised with 21 minutes remaining
@entity116 looked to have sealed the win for the @entity124 late on
but @entity28 had the final say with his last - ditch penalty strike
