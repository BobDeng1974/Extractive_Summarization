doctors have found a way of putting healthy people 's poop into pills to cure serious gut infections - a less invasive way of carrying out ' fecal transplants '			1
@entity9 researchers tried the new tactic on 27 patients and cured them all after strong antibiotics failed to help			1
while it sounds like a gross problem , it 's also a serious one ; half a million @entity15 get @entity16 , or c - diff , infections each year , and about 14,000 die			1
the germ causes nausea , cramping and diarrhea			0
a very potent and pricey antibiotic can kill c - diff but also destroys good bacteria that live in the gut , leaving it more susceptible to future infections			0
inventive : dr. @entity28 , an infectious disease specialist at the @entity30 , holds a container of stool pills that are helping to fight gut infections using samples from healthy people recent studies have shown that fecal transplants - giving infected people stool from a healthy donor - can restore that balance			1
but they 're given through expensive , invasive procedures like colonoscopies or throat tubes			0
doctors also have tried giving the stool through enemas but the treatment does n't always take hold			1
there even are @entity51 videos on how to do a similar treatment at home via an enema			0
a study in a medical journal of a small number of these ' do - it - yourself ' cases suggests the approach is safe and effective			1
dr. @entity28 , an infectious disease specialist at the @entity30 , devised a better way - a one - time treatment custom - made for each patient			0
less invasive : dr @entity28 prepares vials in the process of making stool pills which treat @entity16 , or c - diff , infections			1
every year around 14,000 die from this condition in the @entity15 the ' poop pills ' are being used to treat a serious condition called @entity16 , also known as @entity16			1
it is a bacterium that can cause a wide range of symptoms including from diarrhea , cramping and weight loss to kidney failuer and a life - threatening inflammation of the colon			0
if not treated promptly , the condition can lead to a perforation of the bowel or even death			0
elderly patients in hospitals or long - term facilities are most often affected , but young and healthy individuals are also known to get the condition			1
it can be contracted through the health care facility , where more people carry it , and it is passed in feces and spread to surfaces when infected people do not wash their hands properly			0
the bacterium can be treated with antibiotics , probiotics , fecal transplants - and now , the poop pills			2
each year , more than half a million people get sick from the bacterium and 14,000 die			1
donor stool , usually from a relative , is processed in the lab to take out food and extract the bacteria and clean it			1
it is packed into triple - coated gel capsules so they wo n't dissolve until they reach the intestines			1
' there 's no stool left - just stool bugs			2
these people are not eating poop , ' and there are no smelly burps because the contents are n't released until they 're well past the stomach , @entity28 said			0
days before starting the treatment , patients are given an antibiotic to kill the c - diff			2
on the morning of the treatment , they have an enema so ' the new bacteria coming in have a clean slate , ' @entity28 said			0
it takes 24 to 34 capsules to fit the bacteria needed for a treatment , and patients down them in one sitting			2
the pills make their way to the colon and seed it with the normal variety of bacteria			2
@entity28 described 27 patients treated this way on thursday at @entity145 , an infectious diseases conference in @entity147			1
all had suffered at least four c - diff infections and relapses , but none had a recurrence after taking the poop pills			2
@entity153 , 69 , a retired nurse 's aide from @entity155 , told of the misery of c - diff			0
' it lasted for two years			0
i thought i was dying			0
every time i ate anything or drank water i was into the bathroom , ' she said			0
' i never went anywhere , i stayed home all the time			0
' with her daughter as the donor , she took pills made by @entity28 two years ago , and ' i 've been perfectly fine since , ' @entity168 said			2
life saving : donor stool , usually from a relative , is processed in the lab to extract the bacteria and clean it			1
it is packed into triple - coated gel capsules so they wo n't dissolve until they reach the intestines dr. @entity183 of the @entity184 , who has done fecal transplants through colonoscopies , praised the work			1
' the approach that dr. @entity28 has is completely novel - no one else has done this , ' he said			0
' i am optimistic that this type of preparation will make these procedures much easier for patients and for physicians			2
' the treatment now must be made fresh for each patient so the pills do n't start to dissolve at room temperature , because their water content would break down the gel coating			1
@entity205 doctors are testing freezing stool , which does n't kill the bacteria , so it could be stored and shipped anywhere a patient needed it			2
' you could have a universal donor in @entity205 provide a transplant for someone in @entity214			0
that 's where we 're heading , ' @entity183 said			0
success : researchers tried the tactic on 27 patients and cured them all after strong antibiotics failed to help other researchers are trying to find which bacteria most help fight off c - diff			1
those might be grown in a lab dish and given to patients rather than the whole spectrum of bacteria in stool			1
the hope is ' we could administer that as a probiotic in a pill form , ' @entity183 said			2
@entity28 sees potential for the poop pills for other people with out - of - whack gut bacteria , such as hospitalized patients vulnerable to antibiotic - resistant germs			1
' this approach , to me , has wide application in medicine , ' he said			0
' so it 's not just about c - diff			0
