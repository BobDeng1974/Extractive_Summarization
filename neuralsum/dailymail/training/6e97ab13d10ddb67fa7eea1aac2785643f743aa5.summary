by @entity0 @entity1 with the future @entity2 heartfelt love letters to @entity4 , baby books created by a doting @entity1 , even @entity7 's household accounts - the @entity8 held at @entity9 since 1914 contain rarely seen regal documents going back 700 years			1
and now , along with a new book , 25 of its most impressive treasures are on display at the @entity9 , many for the first time , to mark its centenary year			1
the oldest document in the archive is a list of jewels from the wardrobe of @entity21 , written in @entity22 in 1297 and acquired by @entity23 in 1911			2
among the @entity26 treasures are the household accounts of princess @entity7 , later @entity28 in the early 1550s when she was in her teens , it details the expenses for the scullery and ' saucery ' - where sauces were prepared - at @entity33 , with each page elaborately signed by the princess			2
another account book , from the reign of @entity38 , reveals even kings had to deal with decorators			1
it details work done at @entity9 in the late 17th century , stating that @entity44 artist @entity43 was paid £ 10,000 ( £ 850,000 today ) for doing 20 ceilings , the @entity46 and @entity9			1
in 1912 , just before the archive moved to @entity9 , it acquired 30 large boxes of papers belonging to @entity51 and his son @entity52 that were discovered in the basement of @entity55 in @entity56			1
labelled ' to be destroyed unread ' , they 'd lain there since the @entity57 , executor of the younger @entity52 's will , had received them in 1830			2
they included the 1763 title deed for @entity51 's purchase of @entity65 for £ 28,000 ( £ 3.5m today )			2
originally called @entity65 , it was intended as a private residence for his new wife @entity70			2
it became known as the @entity72 and 14 of the couple 's 15 children were born there			2
a more sensational document , which can be seen in the accompanying book , dates from 22 years later			1
it 's a sham marriage ' certificate ' handwritten by @entity52 , @entity52 , when he attempted to wed @entity78 , a twice - widowed @entity79			1
the ceremony was held in her drawing room at @entity83 in @entity56 , conducted by an @entity85 priest who had been let out of the @entity86 for the occasion and witnessed by @entity78 's brother and uncle			2
the baby book created by a doting @entity1 for her son @entity2 the ceremony was illegal as it violated the @entity93 , which stipulated the monarch 's permission was needed for descendants of @entity97 to marry , and also the 1701 @entity98 which prohibited a @entity100 sovereign , reigning or future , from marrying a @entity79			1
queen @entity4 , a prodigious letter - writer , also kept a diary for 68 years from 1832 until her death			0
it 's estimated she wrote 2,500 words a day , some 60 million words during her lifetime			0
the display features the first of 141 volumes			0
written on 2 august 1832 , it describes the 13 - year - old princess 's progress through the industrial @entity113 on her way to @entity115 where the people were ' black ' , the country ' desolate ' , and the buildings ' flaming with fire '			0
eight years later she married her cousin @entity120			0
he was clearly besotted with his bride - to - be , as a never - before - displayed letter tells us			0
written in @entity125 , it begins , ' dearest deeply loved @entity4 , ' and continues , ' your image fills my whole soul			0
even in my dreams i never imagined i should find so much love on earth			0
' @entity4 's heir , @entity134 , and his consort @entity136 requested that their private papers be destroyed after their deaths			0
a few letters did survive , however , and appear in the book including one from @entity142 to her son @entity52 - later @entity23 - in which she describes motoring ' at 50			1
miles ! ! an hour ! ' @entity52 and his signature on a sham wedding certificate the @entity4 appears to have been a bit of a back seat driver : ' i poke him violently in the back at every corner to go gently and whenever a dog , child or anything else comes in our way , ' but by the summer of 1901 she had moved into the driver 's seat , having instructed her lady - in - waiting to contact the @entity160 in april			1
miss @entity161 duly wrote to one of its senior members that ' the @entity4 as well as myself will be most grateful for some instruction in driving '			0
the book also features some eye - opening documents from the 20th century			1
one reveals @entity23 's voracious appetite for reading - he got through more than 1,000 works between 1890 and 1936 , including the sensational @entity172 , which was first published privately in @entity44 in 1928			1
a fully unexpurgated version was not published in @entity100 until 1960 after a dramatic obscenity trial , but the 68 - year - old @entity23 obtained a copy in 1933 from @entity176 , whose mother @entity177 was a lady - in - waiting to @entity23 's consort @entity1			0
we 're also given a different perspective on the character of @entity1 , who comes across as an emotionally rather chilly character in biographies			0
for example when , after her death in 1953 , her eldest son the @entity188 wrote to his wife , ' i 'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death			0
' the archives , however , show a soft side to her			0
for each of her six children she faithfully kept a baby book in which she recorded their first steps , first words , even their first outing in the royal pram as well as their signatures from the age of eight to 21 , locks of their hair and dozens of photographs			1
@entity7 keeps a diary too , memorably telling two of her ministers , @entity213 and @entity215 , in the 1992 documentary @entity217 that it was n't like @entity4 @entity4 's			0
when @entity213 asked her if she writes it in her own hand she joked , ' well , i ca n't write any other way ! ' the monarchy now has a website , a @entity223 on @entity224 and is on @entity225 , and the challenge for the next century of royal archival life is going to be how to preserve all those emails , text messages and tweets			0
treasures from the @entity8 , @entity9 , until 25 january 2015			1
the book is £ 19.95 from @entity234 shops ; £ 29.95 from bookshops .			1
