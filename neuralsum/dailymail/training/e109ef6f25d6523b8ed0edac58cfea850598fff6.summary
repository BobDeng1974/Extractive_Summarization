a new form of cancer could be triggered by a type of breast implant popular with @entity6 women , scientists are warning			1
at least 150 cases of the disease , called anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( @entity10 ) of the breast , have been reported , including a handful in @entity6			1
nine in 10 cases of the disease – a cancer of the immune system – have been in women who have received breast implants with a textured outer shell , according to experts			1
a nurse holds defective breast implant manufactured by @entity24 company @entity23 ( @entity23 ) scientists say this rougher surface is ‘ the ideal breeding ground ’ for bacteria which could sow the seed of cancer			0
women should be warned of the cancer risk before undergoing implant operations , they argue			0
textured shell implants are relatively uncommon in the @entity35 , but in @entity6 – where 30,000 women have implants every year – they account for 99 per cent of the market			1
most women with @entity10 have made a full recovery after surgery			0
in some cases they also needed chemotherapy and radiotherapy			0

plastic surgeon @entity47 displays a defective silicone gel breast implant manufactured by @entity24 company @entity23 ( @entity23 ) after he removed it from a patient mother - of - two @entity50 , 40 , from @entity52 in @entity53 , passed away in july 2012 , six years after receiving @entity23 implants			2
at the time her family believed the cancer may have been caused by toxic chemicals spilling into her body after the implants ruptured			0
but @entity61 studies have found no ingredients in the now banned @entity23 implants – illegally made with industrial grade silicone – to be carcinogenic			2
now scientists suggest @entity10 is linked to a relatively common complication of having textured breast implants inserted , called capsular contracture			1
implants can enhance women 's lives but can also be a cause of long - term illness textured implants were introduced in the 1980s but not widely used until a decade later			1
prof @entity74 , who led the research study at the @entity76 at @entity77 , said @entity6 should expect to see more cases in the future			1
‘ countries that mainly use textured implants , like @entity82 , have seen proportionally more cases			2
’ but plastic surgeon @entity84 , of the @entity86 , said : ‘ these tumours are extremely rare , treatable and patients should continue to feel safe			0
