@entity0 said it took ' 1,000 dead @entity2 ' before the @entity3 took the @entity5 outbreak seriously , wasting precious time before acting appropriately			1
the @entity13 microbiologist say that although the @entity3 knew about the outbreak three months after it started , it took them a further two months to declare a state of emergency			1
professor @entity0 , director of the @entity17 , was part of a team that discovered the ebola virus in north west @entity21 in 1976			1
' it took three months for the @entity3 to find out there was an @entity5 outbreak , that i understand			1
@entity27 had a poor laboratory infrastructure , ' he said in an interview with @entity30 to @entity31 , due to be aired on saturday			0
' i have much more of a problem with the fact that it took five months for @entity3 , for the international health regulations committee , for that 's what it is , to declare this a state of emergency			1
' it took 1,000 dead @entity2 and two @entity41 who were repatriated to the @entity41 because they were infected			0
' there 's no excuse for that			0
it took too long ; we wasted too much precious time			1
' in october , the professor warned that the @entity5 crisis had spiralled ' out of control '			2
having waited too long to act , he believes the international community has then over-reacted in unhelpful ways			0
he added : ' there is an epidemic of @entity5 in @entity10 and then there is a second epidemic , an epidemic of mass hysteria that we saw particularly in @entity59			1
it was really out of proportion with the issue			0

. ' in theory @entity5 is very easy to control , but it has got completely out of hand , ' he said , speaking at a seminar at @entity86 in october			0
' this is no longer an epidemic , it is a humanitarian crisis			0
' while he predicted the epidemic could be over by this time next year , he said it will take years to help reconstruct the countries devastated by the virus			2
who recently claimed that around 6,000 people had died of the virus since the outbreak begun - and not 7,000 as was previously reported			2
all but around 15 of those deaths have hit the three countries at the heart of the crisis in @entity27 , where the outbreak began last december , @entity102 and @entity103			2
taking action : @entity41 president @entity105 tours a lab with dr. @entity107 to discuss @entity5 while he visits the @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 on tuesday professor @entity0 claims solutions need to address not just the lack of healthcare systems in place in these countries but the local population ’s cultural habits and belief systems			1
he highlights that some parts of @entity10 have a habit of touching the dead at funerals - while others may believe in ‘ witchcraft			0
’ he adds : ' the concept of an infectious agent is not always there			0
