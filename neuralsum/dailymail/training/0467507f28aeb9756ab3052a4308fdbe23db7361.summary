by @entity0 for @entity1 a homeowner is demanding a classroom block towering over his garden be torn down after planners told him it would be 90ft away - then built it 72ft closer to his home			1
a typing error by planning officers in @entity10 saw the temporary classroom listed as being 90ft away from @entity14 's @entity13 home in documents handed to the council			1
however , the building , put up to cope with an influx of pupils at @entity20 , was then constructed just five metres , 16 ft , from his semi-detached home			1
blocked : @entity14 is demanding this classroom block which towers over his garden be pulled down after planners told him it would be 90ft away , then built it 72ft closer to his home ' the council said the building would be 27metres away in the @entity30 document attached to the plan i saw , ' said the plumbing and heating engineer			1
' we did n't have an issue with that			0
' but two or three weeks ago they started building it and i questioned what was going on and they admitted they made a typing error in the documents			2
' i think it was misleading			0
there was n't enough information and i do n't think the drawings were clear			0
' father - of - three mr @entity14 , 31 , says the ' intrusive ' building blocks light into his 42ft back garden and has slashed the value of his £ 220,000 home			1
before : mr @entity14 's garden once looked out onto the playing fields at @entity20 work underway : work began on the temporary classroom earlier this month , when mr @entity14 realised just how close the new classrooms would be to his home ' it blocks light and is intrusive			1
an estate agent came to value the place and was told i 've lost two to five percent of my house value			2
' the whole saga has been quite stressful and the chances of anyone wanting to buy my house are pretty slim now , ' he said			0
' from our dining room window we used to have a great open view out over the school playing field , instead there 's a huge , great building there			2
' intrusive ' : father - of - three mr @entity14 , 31 , says the building blocks light into his 42ft back garden and has slashed the value of his £ 220,000 home ' it towers over my garden and is not nice to look at			1
there are four or five houses either side of me who have to face the same thing			0
' in the winter when the sun is lower it 's going to block light from our garden			0
a tree i planted down there last year will have to be taken out now			0
' mr @entity14 , whose eldest two children go to the school , bought the house he lives in with wife @entity99 , 40 , seven years ago			1
mr @entity14 added : ' i complained and wanted the council to tear the building down but they say there 's nothing they can do			1
' they 've offered to come round and monitor the light into my garden , but it 's all a bit late in my eyes			0
' i think they 're doing things now they should have done earlier			0
' planning documents show it has been given permission to exist until september 2019 - more than five years			1
they read : ' the distance between the proposed mobile unit and the nearest property in @entity121 will be approximately 27m			0
' @entity122 admits there had been a ' clerical error ' in documents considered by the planning committee			1
a spokesman said : ' due to a clerical error , the distance from the temporary classrooms to mr @entity14 's house was given incorrectly on one of the documents presented to planning committee , although not in the consultation documents that were available to residents			1
' while this error is regrettable , members of the planning committee were provided with site photographs and copies of the plans showing the precise location and elevations of the mobile classroom , so they were aware of the proximity of residential properties when considering the matter			2
' this was recognised in some of the conditions attached to the planning permission aimed at minimising the impact on neighbouring properties , including the use of obscured glass on windows overlooking properties and a canopy covering the entrance to the classrooms			0
' this application was subject to consultation with all neighbouring properties and we only received one objection to the scheme from a resident			0
' regret ' : @entity122 says staff sympathise with mr @entity14 , but the distance between his home and the building was listed correctly on photographs and plans given to the planning committee ' this was a near but not immediate neighbour of mr @entity14			1
' while we sympathise with him , we do believe this option is the best solution to accommodate an increased demand for school places in the area			2
' a document from the planning committee 's agenda states the temporary mobile unit will hold two classrooms , toilets and a storage area			2
it was listed as 3.5 metres in height , 16.7 metres deep and 8 metres wide			0
it said : ' the distance between the proposed mobile unit and the nearest property in @entity121 will be approximately 27 metres			0

planning documents said building would be 90ft from @entity14 's home
however , this was an error and temporary classroom is just 16ft away
mr @entity14 , 31 , says the structure has slashed the value of £ 220,000 house
@entity122 says error is ' regrettable ' , but figures were correct on other papers
building is the ' best option ' to accommodate influx of pupils at the school
