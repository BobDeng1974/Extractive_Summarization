by @entity0 and @entity1 just hours after his ex-girlfriend declared her innocence in the murder of her roommate @entity8 , @entity3 's former flame @entity2 said that the @entity11 court 's decision to reconvict them ' is completely unbelievable '			1
@entity2 told the @entity12 this morning that latest court decision that names the @entity14 and her @entity11 boyfriend as the killers of her @entity18 study abroad roommate ' is full of errors , there are mistakes all over the pages ' and he is planning on appealing			1
' they invented new evidence ... they pictured it happening ( and ) it never happened			0
they invented more fiction , ' he said in a remote interview from @entity34 , @entity11			2
i had no reason to hide an argument with @entity3 or mere or anyone in this case			0
he said that ' no clue or little piece of suspect - nothing at all ' places him at the scene or could tie him to the victim 's murder			0
' my position is completely different than @entity3 's case , ' he said , though it came just hours after @entity58 made a similar statement , saying there is no hard evidence to show her as the killer			1
' if i were ( at the scene ) , i would have had traces of @entity8 's broken body on me and i would have left traces of myself around @entity8 's corpse and i 'm not there and that proves my innocence , ' she told @entity73 in an interview that aired thursday night			0
close : the 26 - year - old from @entity76 , @entity77 got emotional as she spoke about @entity78 , saying she would n't have killer her friend ' it 's only speculation that convicts us its evidence that acquits us			1
' victim : @entity58 was first convicted of killing @entity18 roommate @entity8 in 2007			2
she was allowed to return to the @entity14 four years later when that decision was overturned			0
but the case was brought up again this year unlike @entity3 , however , @entity2 was in @entity11 and in court for the latest incarnation of the trial while @entity3 stayed in @entity93 for fear that she would be re-imprisoned if the court found them guilty - which they did			1
' i came back to @entity11 because here i have my dreams my life my friends and i have nothing to hide , ' he said friday morning			0
' there 's nothing against me and nothing has ever been against me			0
i have really a clear conscious and there is no reason for me to accept or understand why i am free or to look at my back or my shadows for the rest of my life			0
' it is completely unbelievable and it 's out of reality			0
' @entity2 has vowed to appeal the latest decision , which finds them guilty of killing @entity78 in 2007			1
this round - the third of its kind after they were first found guilty , then innocent , and now guilty again - raised new questions and suggested a new possible motive in the case			0
the formal ruling was handed down on tuesday in a 337 - page report , which finds that @entity58 stabbed @entity78 to death in a fight over money			1
according to the report , known as a ' motivation ' of the sentence , @entity58 inflicted the fatal knife wound to @entity78 , a student at @entity132			2
the document states : ' it is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events accelerated ; the @entity138 girl was attacked by @entity3 , by @entity2 , who was backing up his girlfriend , and by @entity140 , and constrained within her own room			2
' finding the faults : speaking from @entity34 , @entity11 , @entity2 said his lawyers are working through the 337 - page decision which was handed down on tuesday couple : @entity58 and @entity146 served four years in prison before being acquitted and released			1
however , they were reconvicted by the @entity150 appeals court on january 30 , and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively it adds that it 's difficult to establish a reason for the brutal slaying of ms @entity78 , but goes on to cite allegations of tension between @entity58 and the student			1
it also refers to a statement that @entity140 made to police that ms @entity78 believed @entity58 stole 300 euros ( £ 246 ) - and two credits cards - from her , which is described as a ‘ valid motive ’ for the murder			1
@entity58 is dumbfounded by the court 's conclusions , saying she saved up money to go to @entity11 and was n't financially strained			2
that 's compared to @entity8 , who was separately convicted of @entity78 's murder and testified in this latest case			2
@entity58 says he was ' a known thief , a known burglar who did this on a regular basis to survive ' .			0

@entity2 has spoken from @entity34 , @entity11 about the latest ruling that charges both him and his ex @entity3 with murder
' they invented new evidence , ' he said , vowing to appeal
@entity58 was convicted of killing @entity78 in 2007 but she was allowed to leave @entity11 prison four years later when the ruling was overturned
the case was brought up again this year and she was *re-convicted* in january
on tuesday , the court released a 337 - report on the case , concluding that @entity58 murderer @entity78 in a *row* over money
but @entity58 says she was under no financial strain and that @entity78 was her friend
