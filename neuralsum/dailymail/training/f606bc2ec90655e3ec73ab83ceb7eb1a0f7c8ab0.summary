@entity0 had the look of the emperor with new clothes as @entity4 outplayed , outfought and out - thought @entity7 - until , that was , the final minutes when he was bailed out by @entity6			1
@entity7 had been bereft of any attacking ideas despite what had seemed , on the face of it , fielding a team of offensive possibilities			2
at times it was a bit like the blind leading blind until @entity6 ’s intervention			2
@entity6 ( left ) rescued a point for @entity7 , and saved @entity0 's blushes at @entity19 blind celebrates after scoring an equaliser for @entity7 in the dying moments of the match against @entity4 but just when it seemed the @entity4 had done enough to earn a deserved victory - they had indeed wasted a couple of late chances to seal it - @entity20 picked up the pieces of a half - cleared free - kick and did what none of the @entity7 forwards had managed all afternoon by producing an emphatic finish			1
on the evidence of this though @entity33 needs to get back to his whiteboard , and whatever other tools he uses , and find a formation that works			1
more to the point , one that does n't waste @entity41			2
a couple of weeks ago , @entity33 declared that playing 4 - 4 - 2 gave him a twitchy ' a * * * ' , saying that he felt more secure with a 3 - 5 - 2 or a variant of it			1
it was certainly a squeaky - bum afternoon for the @entity7 manager			2
it was a turn - up for the books when @entity33 fielded an unchanged team from their previous @entity52 match ; last week 's 3 - 1 home win over @entity53			1
and it was once again 4 - 4 - 2 with a twist … the midfield was set out in a diamond shape			0
in that respect , you could describe the formation as 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2			1
@entity60 , @entity61 and @entity41 ( left - right ) all proved ineffective against @entity4 @entity33 ( second right ) watches on as his @entity7 team struggled until a late equaliser blind operated as the anchor man ahead of a back four , @entity41 played towards the right , @entity70 to the left , with @entity72 roaming in the hole behind two front - runners @entity60 and @entity61			1
it is seen as a way of of getting all of @entity7 ’s best attackers in the same team but as the game started to take shape it did n't work that way , and @entity41 looked lost most of the time			1
the @entity84 captain found himself shuttling up and down , somewhere between right - midfield and and inside - right , and often embroiled in a battle with @entity4 skipper @entity88			2
if @entity41 is deployed in a deeper role surely it should be more advanced , in the hole			0
indeed it was n’t long before it appeared @entity7 would have been better served had @entity41 and @entity94 swapped roles			1
after all , @entity94 is naturally a wide player who thrives when he has space ahead of him to exploit his pace and trickery running at defenders			0
as it was , the @entity100 found it hard to find space , constantly crowded out by @entity4 ’s busy midfield and a direct pathway to @entity105 and @entity61 was usually blocked by @entity106 who played the holding role for the @entity4			2
it meant @entity7 ’s two strikers were starved of service not least because of a lack of width			0
@entity105 wipes his brow at @entity19 as he struggled to make an impact against @entity4 @entity115 ( second right ) celebrates after scoring a goal to put @entity4 1 - 0 up against @entity7 @entity41 was reluctant to go wide , and his passing was too often square and safe			1
@entity70 just could n’t get into the game			0
nor did the front two do much to help themselves			0
both @entity105 and and @entity61 were too static , making it easy for @entity121 and make - shift centre - back @entity115 to keep them under wraps			0
what , on paper , seemed to be a team full of attacking possibilities could not even get close to opening up the @entity4 defence in the first half ; keeper @entity130 only having to make one save of note from a speculative @entity94 shot			0
in contrast , @entity4 ’s similar diamond system was more fluid and full of possibilities			2
that was because @entity4 ’s two strikers @entity138 and @entity139 offered much more movement , as did @entity141 who operated as the tip of the diamond			1
@entity115 was afforded three touches in the box as he fired home to give the @entity4 the lead @entity115 smiles after his goal , which put @entity4 1 - 0 up against @entity7 in the @entity52 while @entity94 was bogged down in the middle , @entity141 roamed around with menace and flitted from wing to wing			1
injury to @entity154 meant that @entity155 and @entity139 started together for the first time since the beginning of the season when @entity154 was n't fit			0
their pace , energy and finishing was one of the main reasons the @entity4 got off to such a good start			0
and there was a good case to argue that @entity154 ’s absence was a blessing of sorts			0
without the long high - ball option into the big centre - forward , @entity4 played a much slicker passing game , and the two strikers were a constant threat			1
while @entity7 ’s defence looks far more sound and settled than it was at the start of the campaign - ironically with a back four that @entity33 does not favour - there were still several alarms in the first half ; @entity4 just lacked a precise final ball or finish			1
@entity61 spurns a golden opportunity , putting the ball wide of the post after going through one - on - one @entity61 's heat map shows the @entity189 forward 's poor performance on sunday - he did not play well but that changed just four minutes after the break			0
indecision in @entity7 ’s defence from a set - piece , and weak work by @entity41 , allowed @entity115 to bring the ball down from a free - kick , before swivelling to lash home			1
it was an exciting finish , but it was poor defending			0
@entity7 responded by upping their tempo - but only a bit			2
it was still too predictable , lacking in pace and nous			0
and @entity33 offered nothing in any inspiration from the sidelines			1
he just sat in his seat on the bench and stared blankly			0
his only idea to change things was to take off @entity70 and bring on @entity212			0
@entity33 claimed the introduction of @entity212 was a ' plan b ' but all it amounted to was @entity7 hitting more long balls			1
@entity4 manager @entity216 could n’t resist smirking at the irony of that			0
in the end the only way he could see @entity7 getting back into the game was to go route one			2
so much for the tactical genius of the supposed @entity226 master			0
@entity41 was pushed out wide and was wasted by a poor tactical decision from @entity7 boss @entity33 @entity70 is crowded out by @entity141 ; the @entity7 man struggled at @entity19			1

@entity0 's @entity7 drew 1 - 1 with @entity4 at @entity19
@entity7 played a diamond formation and @entity41 was wasted
@entity6 bailed @entity33 out with an equaliser in the dying moments
@entity33 offered no tactical *knowledge* from the sidelines , instead sitting *quietly* watching the game with a blank expression
