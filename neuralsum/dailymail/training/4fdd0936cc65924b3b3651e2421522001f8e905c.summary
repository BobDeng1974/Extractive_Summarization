the children of a 48 - year - old stroke victim have been forced into a lengthy battle with the @entity3 after doctors placed a controversial ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order on their father			1
days after @entity7 was admitted to @entity8 in @entity9 , doctors applied to put the @entity11 notice on his medical notes – meaning they would let him die if he suffered a cardiac arrest			1
the orders are controversial because they can be applied despite strong objections from relatives if doctors think they are in a patient ’s ‘ best interests ’			1
since august , doctors have applied four times to put a @entity11 on mr @entity7 , who has extensive brain damage			1
he is immobile , confined to an intensive care bed , reliant on a ventilator and largely unable to communicate			0
support : danielle with her father , @entity24 , who is being treated at @entity8 after he suffered a stroke but his son @entity27 and daughter @entity28 believe he could recover – and want him moved			1
they claim @entity8 has ‘ given up ’ on him , and an independent specialist brought in by the hospital to assess the case said he should be resuscitated , if needed , adding : ‘ it is my opinion that full active treatment is in @entity24 ’s best interests			1
’ dr @entity36 found there had been ‘ considerable improvement in his neurology ’ , and he was ‘ noticeably more awake and interactive ’			0
he said he had seen similar patients recover to ‘ a reasonable functional state ’ – although others had died			0
the hospital ‘ categorically refutes ’ any allegation it has ‘ given up ’ on the case			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we would not deny mr @entity7 the opportunity of life - saving treatment if that was a realistic option			1
’ but @entity51 , 28 , from @entity52 , @entity9 , claimed he and his sister had been forced to battle doctors from the start			1
he said : ‘ i ’m not going to let him go without fighting my hardest			0
i would n’t be able to live with myself			0
‘ that ’s my dad			0
but the doctors at @entity60 – they ca n’t understand that			2
their attitude was , “ we are going to give up ”			0
but they never thought that we would actually fight it			0
‘ if you believe something ’s wrong , do n’t you fight it ? ’ he claimed his father understood and had mouthed ‘ do n’t stop ’ to him			2
miss @entity71 , 29 , said last month one doctor advised them to ‘ seriously consider ’ what their father ’s life would be like if he lived on			2
the hospital , based in @entity9 , ' categorically refutes ' any allegation it has ‘ given up ’ on the case if he is to survive , mr @entity7 must have an operation to fix two leaky heart valves and be ‘ weaned ’ off his ventilator			1
dr @entity36 believes it is ‘ more likely than not that he will die ’ due to this treatment			0
but miss @entity71 said : ‘ we ’ve got to give him that chance			0
’ doctors first applied for a @entity11 on august 20 , then again on september 9			1
it was finally imposed on october 14 , but was rescinded the next day after the siblings got lawyers involved			0
on october 22 , doctors reactivated the @entity11 , said miss @entity71			2
it is now suspended while the family wait to hear if the @entity95 in @entity96 will admit mr @entity7			1
doctors there say he ‘ definitely should be considered for surgery ’ but the risk of death is ‘ extremely high ’			2
they want to assess him in person			0
a @entity8 spokesman said last night : ‘ we categorically refute any allegations that we have neglected mr @entity7			1
we have done everything we can to deliver the best possible care in very difficult circumstances			0
’ he said @entity108 officials agreed the hospital was ‘ offering the most appropriate care ’ based on the independent review			2
he added that doctors were awaiting @entity95 ’s decision , and insisted : ‘ we have n’t given up on him			0
