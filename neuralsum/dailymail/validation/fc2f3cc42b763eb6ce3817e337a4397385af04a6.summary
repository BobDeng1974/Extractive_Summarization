the sperm of a proto - facist @entity2 soldier and poet has been used to reconstruct his dna , the first time this technique has been used			1
scientists performed the reconstruction , which usually requires the exhumation of remains , by analysing a handkerchief belonging to soldier and poet @entity12 100 years ago			1
it had been given by @entity12 to his lover , countess @entity14 , in 1916 with semen residue on it			1
@entity2 @entity12 's ( shown right , with @entity18 on the left ) sperm was use to reconstruct his dna			1
scientists analysed a handkerchief belonging to @entity12 100 years ago			1
it had been given to his lover @entity25 with semen on it the handkerchief was analysed by police in @entity31 , @entity32 , along with a letter written by the countess and an ivory toothbrush			1
they had been stored at the @entity38 foundation in @entity39 , northern @entity2			2
@entity12 , born 12 march 1863 , moved into the building in 1922 until his death on 1 march 1938			2
it was later turned into a museum			0
scientists believe that dna evidence found at a crime scene could in the future be used to create mugshots of criminal suspects			0
this is one potential use to emerge from a new research paper - modeling 3d facial shape from dna - published on last year in @entity53			0
in the article , a team of scientists explained how they were able to produce crude 3d models of faces simply from people 's dna samples			2
‘ we show that facial variation with regard to sex , ancestry , and genes can be systematically studied with our methods , allowing us to lay the foundation for predictive modeling of faces , ’ the researchers wrote			0
experts studied the artifacts using a crimescope light , which can observe objects in a variety of wavelengths			0
this revealed the hidden blotches on the handkerchief , the dna results of which were then compared with @entity82 , the right - wing revolutionary ’s great grandson			0
@entity38 foundation chief @entity84 joked that the experiment might open the door to the future cloning of historical figures even if their remains have been lost			0
‘ nobody wants to clone @entity12 , but nobody knows what changes will take place in science and society , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s good the dna has been collected			0
’ @entity99 news agency described @entity12 as a ‘ proto - fasciast warmonger ’ , with many saying his ideals were a forerunner to @entity2 fascism			1
the @entity2 @entity104 ( shown ) presented results of their research about an unpublished letter that @entity12 ( 1863 - 1938 ) wrote on 15 july 1935			2
@entity12 's dna has been extracted from a handkerchief stained with sperm that the poet gave a woman as a ' present ' after having sex in 1916 a member of the @entity2 @entity104 presents an unpublished letter ( left ) that @entity2 poet @entity12 ( 1863 - 1938 ) wrote on 15 july 1935 to @entity104 colonel @entity116			1
right is an image provided by @entity12 's @entity118 showing @entity2 poet @entity12 ( 1863 - 1938 ) the handnkerchief was studied using a crimescope light , which can observe objects in a variety of wavelength			1
this revealed the hidden blotches on the handkerchief , the dna ( stock image shown ) results of which were then compared with @entity82 , the rightwing revolutionary ’s great grandson			0

@entity2 @entity12 's sperm was use to reconstruct his dna
scientists analysed a handkerchief belonging to @entity12 100 years ago
it had been given to his lover @entity25 with semen on it
@entity21 reconstruction usually requires the exhumation of remains
but this technique could now help when cases have gone cold
