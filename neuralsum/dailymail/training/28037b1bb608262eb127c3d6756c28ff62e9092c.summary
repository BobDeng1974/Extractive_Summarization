by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:04 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 07:57 est , 21 september 2013 the @entity3 woman who almost died when a drunk driver hit her head - on in early august thanks the priest who prayed with her at the scene for her survival			1
at first , 19 - year - old @entity9 did n't know the identity of the caring priest , since none of the pictures taken at the scene that day pictured him			1
that mystery sparked a search to identify the holy man , and eventually father @entity19 of @entity20 , @entity18 came forward			1
scroll down for @entity21 special meeting : @entity9 , left , will reunite today with father @entity19 , right , the catholic priest who prayed by her side after she was struck head - on by a drunk driver last august hanging onto her life : on the morning of august 4 , @entity9 was hit head - on by a drunk driver and it took emergency crews more than two hours to extricate her from her green @entity30 @entity31 briefly visited @entity9 in the hospital one week after the crash , but will enjoy a longer reunion with the recovering @entity36 student today for her twentieth birthday party at her home in @entity39 , @entity3			1
' today is the real reunion , ' @entity9 's mother @entity40 told @entity42			1
@entity31 first encountered @entity9 on the morning of august 4 , after his 8:30am sunday mass @entity9 , a sophomore at @entity36 , was driving from her parents ' @entity39 , @entity3 home to @entity45 , @entity18 , where she has a summer internship			1
her @entity30 was hit head - on by another vehicle , driven by a drunk driver and the accident crushed @entity9 's car in a mangled wreck that left her with multiple broken bones , a ruptured spleen and damaged liver			1
at first @entity31 's identity remained a mystery until he stepped forward after the story was publicized in the media recovering : @entity9 recovering at the hospital after the crash on august 4			1
@entity31 briefly visited her there a week after the crash , but the visit was cut short workers from across the county battled for over an hour and a half to extricate @entity9 from her car - but she was fading fast and their equipment was not heavy duty enough			1
it was then that she asked to pray and at that moment the priest appeared to offer his blessings to @entity9 and the emergency workers			2
the silver haired priest was reportedly in his 50s or 60s and was wearing black pants , a black shirt and black collar and seemingly stepped forward to answer @entity9 's plea from nowhere			1
savior : since no one recognized @entity31 , some faithful people hypothesized that the priest was actually the saint @entity86 @entity87 , the @entity88 fire chief said that it struck him as odd from the start as @entity91 was blocked off for two miles in each direction and no one from the close - knit community recognized the man			2
' we 're all local people from four different towns , ' @entity87 said			0
' we 've only got one catholic church out of three towns and it was n't their priest			0
' immediately after the 6ft tall priest gave his blessing , the emergency workers righted the car , stabilized @entity9 's vital signs and cut her out once the jaws of life appeared from a neighboring town			1
she was put in an air ambulance and taken to a nearby hospital but by then the priest was gone			0
for a time , speculation become rife that @entity9 may have been visited by the spirit of @entity115			2
however , despite not appearing in any of the 70 photographs taken at the scene , it was not an aparition who helped @entity9 that day , but @entity31			1
' their calmness kept me calm as well			0
so i can not express my gratitude enough toward them , ' @entity9 told @entity126			0
watch video here : prayer : when emergency workers could not free her - @entity9 asked them to stop so that a prayer could be said while @entity19 left the scene without any fuss , his disappearance added to the mystery			1
he was quickly dubbed the ' angel priest ' and in his absence he became a national celebrity			0
' i have no doubt the @entity142 answered their prayers and i was part of his answer , but only part , ' @entity19 , a priest in the @entity139 of @entity45 , told @entity126 earlier this month			2
when she was recovering in the hospital late last month , @entity9 spoke of her pride that her story has inspired so many people across the country			2
' i love hearing that support , because it 's what drives me to push myself harder everyday with therapy , ' she said			0
impact : @entity9 says she loves hearing how her story has inspired others , and how that motivates her to push herself everyday with her therapy @entity19 , under the article on the @entity162 site , explained he was in fact responsible for the apparent divine intervention			1
he said he had been filling in for a sick priest at @entity166 and was on his way home when he came upon the crash scene			2
authorities had closed off the area and were re-routing traffic but @entity19 waited until he could get closer			0
' i parked behind a large vehicle about 150 yards from the scene			0
i asked the sheriff 's permission and approached the scene of the accident , ' @entity19 said			2
stuck : it took crews more than two hours to get @entity9 out of the car which makes it all the more miraculous that she is going to make a full recovery ' i absolved and anointed @entity9 , and , at her request , prayed that her leg would not hurt			2
then i stepped aside to where some rescue personnel and the pilot were waiting , and prayed the rosary silently			0
' he said he left the wreckage just as the helicopter was about to leave to take @entity9 to hospital			0
interestingly , he said he told someone on the scene his name but it must not have been passed on			0
@entity198 , a native of @entity199 , @entity200 , was ordained a priest of the @entity202 in 1982 and has served at parishes in @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 , @entity18 , and in the diocese â€™s mission parishes in @entity212 and @entity213 , @entity214			0
he is currently serving in prison ministry and in parish ministry to @entity218 - speaking @entity217			0
progress : at the end of august , @entity9 was already able to walk 150 feet unaided			0

@entity3 student @entity9 , 19 , will reunite with the priest who prayed by her side the morning she was hit by a drunk driver
today marks @entity9 's twentieth birthday and it will be the first time she has seen the priest since he briefly visited her in the hospital a week after the crash
at first , father @entity19 's identity was a mystery since he was n't captured in any of the pictures taken on the scene that day
but after @entity9 's story was picked up by several news outlets , @entity31 came forward
