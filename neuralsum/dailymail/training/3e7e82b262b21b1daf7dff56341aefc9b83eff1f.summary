cleanse , tone and moisturise is a mantra for millions of women , sold by the beauty industry as a sure - fire way to fresh , glowing skin			2
but while the benefits of cleansing and moisturising are obvious , part of the routine is simply habit for many women - and few question its benefits : toning			2
toning is meant to remove the last traces of dirt and grime , leaving skin dewy and pores closed			1
according to market intelligence firm @entity23 , one in five of us uses toners daily - which range in price from £ 1.32 for @entity26 's to £ 110 for @entity28 ' @entity27			1
toning is meant to remove the last traces of dirt and grime , leaving skin dewy and pores closed - but the products contain alcohol and parabens which can damage our skin astoundingly , this means toners are more popular than anti-ageing serums ( used by 13 per cent ) and acne products ( three per cent )			1
but many women who religiously apply this classic skin care product do n't realise toners can include harsh ingredients such as alcohol , which can dry out even the most oily skin , and parabens , which have been shown to induce allergic reactions			2
' the alcohol found in toners can be a trigger for rosacea , increase the risk of breakouts in acne - prone skin or exacerbate sensitivity , ' reveals cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity57			1
this means that regular use of toners could leave the skin irritated , inflamed and vulnerable to environmental damage			2
dr @entity57 believes that even if your toner does n't harm your skin , its place in your beauty regime may be redundant			0
' soap used to leave behind residues , but today 's cleansers are designed to rinse clean and do n't disturb the skin 's natural equilibrium in the same way , so there 's no need to use a toner			0
' toners range in price from @entity26 's £ 1.32 product , left , to @entity28 ' @entity27 , £ 110 , right in fact , in the @entity82 the @entity81 disallowed many of the claims made for skin toners in @entity87 and said no astringent could improve skin elasticity or close pores			1
but elsewhere , the idea that they ' tightened pores ' and ' stimulated circulation ' persisted			2
@entity96 - based consultant nurse practitioner of @entity98 @entity97 , @entity99 , agrees : ' although toners momentarily appear to make the skin seem cleaner and tighter , for the most part they are an expensive soup of water , colours , preservatives , alcohol and acids			1
' most toners actually do more harm than good because they disrupt the delicate balance of the skin , which can lead to symptoms such as dry , oily and cracked skin			0
this can increase the growth of bacteria , risking further breakouts in all skin types			0
' two products recommended by doctors are @entity123 ( £ 32 , facethefuture.co.uk ) , left , and @entity124 ( £ 25.18 , @entity125 , right so is every toner a waste of money ? not necessarily			1
@entity129 ( £ 19.50 , effortlessskin.com ' some modern toners contain skin - calming ingredients like plant oils and aloe vera , and can even be made with salicylic acid , which has a positive impact in skin rejuvenation , ' says cosmetic doctor dr @entity138			1
he recommends @entity129 ( £ 19.50 , effortlessskin.com ) , @entity123 ( £ 32 , facethefuture.co.uk ) and @entity124 ( £ 25.18 , effortlessskin.com )			1
' these can also break up the glue between epidermal skin cells , allowing the dead skin cells to be exfoliated off , which brings fresh skin cells to the surface , leading to a brighter complexion			0
' @entity146 also advocates the use of new skin care products with toning properties			0
' advanced alternative solutions known as balancers and skin conditioners contain far more effective , friendly ingredients such as antioxidants that promote skin health , ' she reveals			0
her favourites include @entity158 ( £ 35 , shopfacialgarden.com ) and @entity159			0
so if want to rejuvenate your skin with a toner , skip solutions with high alcohol content and choose calming , balancing lotions with effective ingredients			0
or you could be splashing your cash on a product that 's no more effective than cold water .			0
