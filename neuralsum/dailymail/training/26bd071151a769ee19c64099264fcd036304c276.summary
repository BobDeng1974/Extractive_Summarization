from herbal remedies to acupuncture and hypnotherapy , we will try anything that promises to banish pounds without the need for willpower			0
and with stars like @entity14 and @entity15 crediting acupuncture with their healthy physique , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 preaching the benefits of green tea and @entity22 extolling the virtues of natural diet pills , the allure of the diet aid is a powerful one			1
but according to a new study , these complementary medicines could have no absolutely no effect as weight loss aids - and could in fact be causing more harm than good			2
@entity14 and @entity15 credit regular acupuncture with helping keep them red carpet ready the @entity35 reports that a study by the @entity37 into natural diet aids has found that there is no evidence that natural diet remedies work to help with weight loss			1
@entity43 , professor of complementary medicine at the @entity37 , went as far as to call them ' bogus ' , saying that while natural remedies have a better image than diet pills , his extensive research has found no evidence that they work			1
in his latest study , published in the @entity52 supplements @entity54 reviewed control trials which reported a positive effect on weight loss of @entity58 , or @entity59 , which is found in many natural diet products			1
although all three studies claimed the @entity62 @entity59 was more effective than a placebo , professor @entity43 found their methodology was flawed and the supplement could not be recommended as a weight loss aid			2
he said : ' over the years we have looked into a lot of treatments and there is not a single one i recommend			0
' indeed professor @entity43 , who has previously been labelled as the ‘ @entity73 ’ for exposing phoney claims by herbal and homeopathic drug companies , warns that such weight loss methods can even be harmful			1
both @entity19 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) credit green tea for their enviable figures though homeopathic remedies are generally harmless , he says that some may cause headaches and insomnia , as well as potentially interacting with prescription medications			2
@entity43 claims that the natural diet remedy industry - worth an estimated £ 1 billion - is preying on those who are desperate to lose weight and therefore vulnerable			1
he says : ‘ they are easy victims of the irresponsible promises that are being made on the internet and elsewhere			0
' @entity43 's own complex theory on weight loss ? ' eat less and do more exercise			0
' @entity22 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) have both used natural aids to try and shift the pounds			0

natural or homeopathic diet aids have no effect on weight loss , study finds
green tea *capsules* , acupuncture and herbal pills are *popular* with *celebrities*
*university* of @entity37 study found methods can even have harmful side effects
the natural weight loss industry is estimated to be worth over £ 1 billion
' @entity73 ' professor behind study says remedies prey on the vulnerable
