by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 , @entity3 ’s veteran goalkeeper coach , was expecting a promising 14 - year - old by the name of @entity6 but did not recognise the callow youth who turned up at his door clutching a pair of gloves			1
‘ i did n’t realise he was the goalkeeper they meant because he was so small and his voice was so high , ’ recalls @entity2			1
‘ from a physical point of view , he was the opposite of a goalkeeper			0
’ when @entity3 considered letting @entity6 go shortly afterwards , however , @entity2 had already seen enough to know they were making a big mistake			1
‘ do n’t do it , ’ he said			0
‘ one day @entity6 will be the best in the world			2
he has been the outstanding goalkeeper of the tournament , brilliant against @entity39 and @entity40 , unbeatable against @entity41			0
now it ’s the turn of @entity43 to try and find a way past @entity45 ’s imperious 6ft 4in ‘ sweeper keeper ’			1
alongside @entity6 in @entity47 will be @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , three other graduates of @entity52 comprehensive who went to school in the shadow of @entity3 ’s old @entity55			1
@entity6 could see it from the window of his house in the @entity60 district of @entity61			2
he was given his first ball at the age of two and had signed up for @entity3 when he was four , initially as a striker			2
‘ the coach put me in goal and back then we were playing on bone - hard ground , ’ he recalls			2
‘ red ash , we even trained on black ash , which was worse			0
au revoir : @entity6 's fine save from @entity26 was @entity41 's last chance of the game as @entity45 held out ‘ that ’s not easy for a goalkeeper			1
my mother was always taking out her sewing kit for the countless holes in my training pants			0
for a long time i had to buy my own gear			0
@entity83 : @entity6 in 2004 as a @entity3 youngster ‘ i used to cry when i let in a goal			1
i always thought i was to blame because i was the last man			0
’ @entity6 , a promising tennis player until he gave up the sport in favour of football at the age of 14 , has developed an altogether tougher mentality over the years			2
former @entity93 international @entity92 refers to him as @entity94 and @entity95 , @entity45 ’s goalkeeper coach at this @entity37 , believes the @entity98 star is one of the finest exponents of nervenstarke — strength of nerve			1
‘ this is the quality that makes him stand out , ’ says @entity95			0
‘ if something goes wrong for him during the game , he can put it aside immediately			0
he embodies exactly the goalkeeper we want to see in the national team			0
he ’s not only an excellent keeper , but also a good footballer who can participate in the build - up play			2
’ if @entity6 is n’t keeping the ball out of his goal — the nonchalant one - handed block from @entity41 ’s @entity26 in the quarter - finals was reminiscent of @entity118 deflecting a bullet — he is charging out of his box to break up an attack or venturing forward with the ball			2
a sweeper keeper , the penalty area is just a white line drawn for the benefit of others			1
‘ my role model was @entity132 who played that way when it was unusual , ’ says @entity6 , who was also a big admirer of former @entity3 and @entity130 keeper @entity129			1
‘ the game has changed			0
i want to help and support the team , even if it ’s with my feet			0
’ celebrate : @entity45 's goalkeeper coach @entity95 embraces @entity6 as he waves to the fans @entity140 : @entity6 and @entity141 applaud the @entity93 fans after sealing a spot in the last four @entity6 ’s brother @entity144 , who is one year younger , is a referee who officiates fixtures up to the fourth tier of @entity93 football			1
@entity6 will be operating on a different level against @entity149			1
the hopes of a nation could rest on his shoulders			0
‘ he has proven at this @entity37 that he is the world ’s best goalkeeper , ’ says @entity45 ’s legendary keeper @entity153			1
‘ everyone knows he is a wonderful footballer but what is crucial is that in important situations he can rescue the win			0
that is what he ’ll be measured by			0
’ back then : @entity6 thwarting @entity162 's @entity161 during his days with @entity3			1

the @entity93 stopper was once just a thin 14 - year - old , recalls @entity3 's veteran goalkeeper coach @entity2
@entity166 must find a way past @entity45 's 6ft 4in ' sweeper keeper '
