by @entity0 published : 13:40 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 17:44 est , 29 october 2013 fears that use of @entity2 and @entity3 is making people ruder is a myth and @entity6 is still a nation of polite people , according to university researchers			1
for centuries @entity6 have been famed for their reserve , indirect way of saying things and , of course , a love of queuing			2
and although many of us might believe that modern life , texting and tweeting is making us as a nation ruder , the study from @entity16 's @entity15 has found that the @entity6 are just as polite as ever			1
myth : despite fears to the contrary , a new academic study has shown that using @entity3 and @entity2 is not making us ruder , and that @entity6 is still a nation of polite people however , the research has revealed that what we find polite , and what we find rude , is unique to @entity6 culture , and can be very different to notions of rudeness in other countries			1
as part of his research professor @entity34 , an expert in linguistic politeness , studied 500 diary reports of incidents of impoliteness experienced by those living in @entity6 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
he found that whilst personal image and appearance was most important for @entity48 , social rights and fairness , and how they were perceived within a group , was most important for the @entity44			0
' this fits the idea that @entity6 culture is more individualistic , whereas @entity44 culture emphasizes one 's position in the group and social reciprocity , for example reciprocal gift giving and returning favours , ' said professor @entity34			1
the study also dispels the popular belief that we 're getting ruder , with the perceived rise in impoliteness merely down to a clash of values between different generations			1
professor @entity34 said that if anything , we are more polite than our ancestors , and that 400 years ago everyday language was far more plain and direct than it is today			2
professor @entity34 said : ' a thousand or so years ago in @entity73 , it was fine to use brusqueness which is jaw - dropping from our modern perspective			0
national sport : the @entity6 are famed for their love of queuing , as these polite sports fans hoping to watch @entity79 play at @entity80 demonstrate ' our impression of a massive explosion in the use of impolite language is partly the panic reaction of those with more traditional values meeting new values - values which encourage more direct ways of expressing emotions and doing business			1
' he added : ' the new ' let it all hang out ' culture is clashing with the " beat about the bush " culture			0
a result of this clash is a sense amongst traditionalists that their values are under attack			0
' professor @entity34 's research will be presented on november 4 as part of next week 's @entity105 â€™s annual @entity104 , which encompasses a series of events across the @entity6			1
as part of the study he also found that when people talk about things they consider impolite , they actually refer to a very limited number of things in specific contexts			0
professor @entity34 used the two - billion word @entity117 , an electronic collection of various writings including newspapers and online blogs , and found that actions likely to be described as rude or impolite included : ' evesdropping ' , interrupting ' , ' pointing ' , ' ignoring ' , ' smoking ' and ' laughing '			0
among the people most likely to be described as rude or impolite included : ' doorman ' , ' bouncer ' , ' bartender ' , ' waitress ' , ' waiter ' , ' staff ' , ' guest ' and ' customer '			2
many of these relate to those in public service , where people have expectations of entitlements , which are not always met			0
research : the study was carried out by academics at the @entity16 ( file picture ) professor @entity34 said : ' @entity145 often gets a bad press			2
it is assumed to be a poor , debased kind of language used for dysfunctional social purposes			0
but impoliteness can also be sophisticated , creative , and can entertain			0
' the word most commonly used by people when describing events in which they had been offended was ' patronising ' , which professor @entity34 said was because the @entity6 are particularly sensitive to power hierarchies and can take offence when a speaker adopts a position of superiority			1
' what @entity6 people tend to react to and label as impoliteness are abuses of power , that is , cases where a person or group exerts power over another person or group beyond what is considered legitimate , ' he said			2
' this means that while asking someone to do something in a normal way is not considered impolite when the speaker is in a position of power , for example a boss asking an employee to do something , even politely worded requests could be deemed to be rude , if the speaker were in a position of very low power			0

study probes diary reports of rudeness to find @entity6 are as polite as ever
professor says perceived rise in impoliteness down to generational clash
' @entity200 ' *professions* include doorman , bouncer and waiter
@entity205 most commonly used to describe offence is ' patronising '
