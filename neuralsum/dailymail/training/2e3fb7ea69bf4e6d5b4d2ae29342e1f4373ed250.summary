they are the much - coveted jetset jobs that see men and women fly around the world to exciting destinations			0
but working as cabin crew certainly comes with its trials - especially with the unusual requests often made by airlines			1
from a minimum arm reach to jungle training and even an enforced single relationship status , airlines often demand the most unlikely situations and skills of their employees			1
the same airline was the subject of controversy just a year ago after it was reported that female cabin crew must remain unmarried for the first five years of their contract			1
the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) launched a campaign against the airline over its demands about marriage and pregnancy			2
the airline reportedly warns women who fall pregnant that they can not be guaranteed ground staff jobs			2
@entity45 came under fire for reportedly not allowing air stewardesses to marry in their first five years of the job @entity49 told @entity50 : ' if you come to seek employment with @entity20 we give you a document that these are the rules and regulations , if you as a mature individual accept those conditions , then you should nâ€™t complain			2
' he added : ' you know they have come there to do a job and we make sure that they are doing a job that they give us a good return on our investment			0
' @entity69 has contacted @entity20 for further comment on the policy			0
that 's not the only bizarre - and sometimes seemingly unnecessary - requirement made on future air stewards			0
air stewards working for @entity77 airlines in @entity78 are required to undergo a strict @entity80 jungle training for instance , @entity78 airline @entity77 require air staff to undergo intense @entity84 survival training			1
over half of the country is covered in rugged rainforest and if an aircraft had to make an emergency landing among the trees , cabin crew need to be prepared			1
in fact , the country 's government require any airline based in the country to offer this kind of training			2
according to airline reporter , @entity77 's course is undertaken by cabin crew in a section of rainforest behind their training centre , and includes instructions on using debris to build a makeshift lavatory			1
meanwhile , @entity110 cabin crew - male and female - must attend a ' groom school ' at the airline 's base in @entity114 , near @entity115 , to learn the company 's staunch rules on appearance , which includes a minimum make up requirement			1
' stewardesses must wear mascara , blusher and red lipstick , ' grooming manager @entity121 told the @entity126			0
@entity128 crew @entity127 and @entity129 sit in one of the engines of an @entity132 at @entity134 airport ' the boys are allowed to use clear mascara and wear make - up - like to cover up a spot - as long as you ca n't tell			2
' the airline has its own shade of lipstick - @entity142 by @entity143 , which exactly matches the uniform			0
' the girls can pick any red from any brand and they need n't spend a fortune			0
nails should be red too , or smartened with a @entity151 manicure or pale pink polish			0
' @entity153 also has its own unusual requests , asking for cabin crew applicants only aged between 20 and 28 with excellent eyesight			1
@entity153 advertises for staff aged between 20 and 28 years old who will not be allowed to wear glasses however , applicants are assured they will be allowed to wear contact lenses if needed , but no glasses			0
@entity128 air stewards do not have such strict rules , but the safety requirements on their website stipulate that applicants must be able to tread water for at least a minute			1
@entity169 stops short of that but asks that all cabin crew are ' able to swim well '			2
they also request that stewards are between 5ft 2inches and 6 ft 2inches height ' with weight in proportion '			0
like @entity45 , @entity177 requires that cabin crew have an arm reach of just less than 84 inches while standing on tiptoes			1
@entity110 cabin crew - male and female - are required to attend a ' @entity182 ' to hone their immaculate appearance @entity185 ' @entity184 who works as a member of the @entity115 cabin crew team @entity185 underline the importance for its cabin crew to look preened at all @entity192 request that tights are 10 or 15 denier in black , or nearly black , shirts well ironed and crisp , and nail polish must be red or very pale natural shades			1
@entity197 , @entity198 , told : ' we expect our crew to look the part and uphold high uniform standards , both in the air and on the ground			0
@entity185 ' uniform is one of the most distinctive and our customers immediately recognise our crew when they step on board			0
' according to one poster , apparently recruiting cabin crew in @entity210 , @entity153 requires air stewards to be aged between 20 and 28 , university educated and with a minimum height of 5 ft 3 inches			1
those who fall short by an inch can reconcile themselves with the fact that they still make the @entity169 minimum height .			0

@entity45 airlines request cabin crew have an arm stretch of 84 inches
@entity78 airline @entity77 train their flight attendants in jungle survival skills
meanwhile , @entity128 staff must be able to tread water for at least a minute
