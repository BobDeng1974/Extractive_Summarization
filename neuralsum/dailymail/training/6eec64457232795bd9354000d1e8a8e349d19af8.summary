@entity1 enthusiasts claim to have spotted @entity3 's head on the @entity5 surface			2
they says a panoramic image from 2005 taken by the @entity7 shows a rock shaped uncannily like the president 's head - and that it could be part of a statue			1
it is the latest in a long line of claims of heads and other structures on the thousands of images sent back from the @entity5 surface by @entity19 's rovers			1
the summit region is a broad plateau about 100 meters ( 300 feet ) above the surrounding plains of @entity35 , consisting mostly of outcrop rocks and windblown drifts			0
' searching for structures on @entity5 i found this head , ' said @entity41 of the @entity43 blog			0
' from the way its standing up i would say that it is a full statue , but is buried from the shoulders down			0
' he believes the structure in @entity49 printed			0
however , another @entity1 enthusiast , writing on @entity51 , altered the image on a computer and found @entity3 's head was revealed			1
' by cleaning the image in a software program , i discovered that this relic has an uncanny resemblance to the @entity60 president , @entity3			2
' the original image is taken from the @entity7 's @entity26 ' @entity25 ' panorama , acquired on sols 620 to 622 ( october 1 to 3 , 2005 ) from a position in the @entity28 at the true summit of @entity30 on the @entity5 surface			1
it was released online by @entity19 , and even turned into an interactive panorama			1
where 's @entity3 ? the original image of the @entity5 surface			1
the image is taken from the @entity7 's @entity26 ' @entity25 ' panorama , acquired on sols 620 to 622 ( october 1 to 3 , 2005 ) from a position in the @entity28 at the true summit of @entity30 on the @entity5 surface			1
as the image is zoomed in , a skull - like rock becomes more visible the summit region of @entity5 is a broad plateau about 100 meters ( 300 feet ) above the surrounding plains of @entity35 , consisting mostly of outcrop rocks and windblown drifts			1
the image is the latest in a series claiming to show faces on @entity5			1
@entity83 is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimuli			2
it is a form of @entity89 , which is when people see patterns or connections in random , unconnected data			0
there have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places , especially the faces of religious figures			2
although @entity1 experts say the rock has the fave of president @entity3 , experts say it is simply a case of @entity83 , the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus			1
many involve images of @entity112 , the @entity113 and the word @entity115			2
for example , in september 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey , leading believers in @entity121 to pay homage to the @entity124 god			0
another famous instance was when @entity113 's face was a grilled cheese sandwich			2
images of @entity112 have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of @entity131 and in a potato			2
for the the last few decades @entity19 has spent billions of dollars on a variety of missions to @entity5 to find out if the planet might once have been habitable			2
but has a @entity137 blogger found evidence for past life on @entity5 in the form of a human face - like rock hidden in an old @entity19 photo ? the answer , of course , is an emphatic ' no ' , but that has n't stopped the @entity1 enthusiast from suggesting that the rock may be a sign the planet was once inhabited			1
on his website @entity43 mr @entity41 said he has ' found a new face ' on @entity5			0
the discovery was seemingly made by the @entity153 on @entity5 back on 22 july 1997 , but not unearthed by mr @entity41 until now			0
in a video he expresses bafflement that @entity19 has pointed out features on @entity5 , including the face , with arrows in the image			1
' this rover found some objects and @entity19 was pointing them out with different arrows			1
' i was just thinking ' wow @entity19 's really not helping us at all find any of these objects on @entity5 ' and bam , there is an arrow pointing right to the face			1
' the actual ' face ' spotted by mr @entity41 is in the bottom left of the main image			0
it appears to bear a resemblance to a human face with a nose , chin , eyes and so on			0
sadly for mr @entity41 and similar @entity1 enthusiasts , this rock like so many others has a simple explanation			0
@entity41 has previously claimed he has found signs of life in an old @entity19 photo ( mr @entity41 has highlighted the ' facial ' features to the right )			2
the image comes from the @entity190 - based agency 's first rover on @entity5 , called @entity153 , which landed on @entity5 on 4 july 1997			1
in the image the rock seems to have a human - like appearance @entity153 was a rover that travelled with the @entity196 mission			1
it landed on @entity5 on 4 july 1997 and became the first rover to operate on the surface of the red planet			0
it was designed to last just seven days on @entity5 but stayed active for 83 @entity5 days , eventually losing communication with @entity202 on 27 september 1997			0
in its time on @entity5 the rover travelled a bit more than 330ft ( 100 metres ) the rover returned more than 550 images and , through chemical analyses of rocks and soil , also suggested that @entity5 may have once been warm and wet			0
namely , it is simply a chance alignment that tricks the brain into thinking it is seeing a face - known as face pareidolia			1
mr @entity41 also added : ' of course @entity19 noticed it , but they did n't label the reason for the arrow			2
' however , looking up the image in @entity19 's library of images reveals the true reasons for the arrows			1
' the large rounded rocks in the distance , marked by the red arrows , are comparable to ' @entity226 ' said @entity19			2
@entity226 , found previously by @entity153 , was the first rock on @entity5 found to be made of basalt , which suggested the planet was once volcanic			0
its smoothness also hinted at a wet past for the planet			0
' a second population of smaller , angular rocks ( blue arrows ) in the foreground have unweathered surfaces even on the downwind side , except where covered on their tops by drift ' @entity19 continued			2
' the third kind of rock ( white arrows ) is white and flat , and includes ' @entity245 ' in the foreground			0
' ' scooby doo ' was a pink rock that was coated with a crusty substance and contained a lot of rust			0
mr @entity41 says this indicates the planet was once inhabited			0
however the rock is nothing more than a case of pareidolia - when our brain tricks us into see human faces in objects like @entity112 in toast			1
@entity19 also said the arrows simply showed different types of rock the image was taken by @entity19 's @entity153 on 22 july 1997			1
this particular rock had an unweathered surface that appeared to have been unaffected by wind on @entity5 - but it was not a sign that some sort of intelligent civilisation carved a face into the rock the agency explains how the image is a 360 - degree colour gallery pan looking to the northeast of @entity5			1
in it the colours have been exaggerated to highlight the differences between rocks and soils			0
the image is actually fairly remarkable as it is one of the first images ever taken by a rover - in this case @entity153 - on @entity5			1
@entity153 ( seen here with the @entity226 rock ) was a rover that travelled with the @entity196 mission			0
it landed on @entity5 on 4 july 1997 and became the first rover to operate on the surface of the red planet			0
it was designed to last just seven days on @entity5 but stayed active for 83 @entity5 days until 27 september 1997			0

image comes from @entity19 's @entity7
in the image a rock seems to have a human - like appearance
expert say rock is nothing more than a case of pareidolia - when our brain tricks us into see human faces in objects like @entity112 in toast
