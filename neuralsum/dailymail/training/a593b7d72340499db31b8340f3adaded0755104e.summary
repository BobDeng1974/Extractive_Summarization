by @entity0 forget going under the knife , if you want to show off a bountiful cleavage on the beach this summer then @entity2 say they have the answer			0
the lingerie brand promise to boost women by two cup sizes with their ' boob job ' bikini			1
following on from the success of their ' @entity14 ' the company are responding to demand from their customers who want to be body confident on their summer holidays			1
instant lift : @entity2 model @entity19 said the bikini boosted her bust from a @entity23 to a @entity24 but rather than resort to expensive surgery to get a lift , @entity2 offers the same effect for £ 30 with their bikini top , which is available in hot pink and cobalt shades			1
matching briefs cost £ 14			0
they create the uplifting effect using in - built gel technology which is integrated into a foam cup			1
the bikinis go on sale today in sizes 32a to 3dd and eight to 18 for the briefs			1
@entity19 , who modelled the bikini for the @entity2 campaign , said she was impressed with the way the swimwear boosted her cleavage from a @entity23 to an ample @entity24			1
true blue : @entity2 founder @entity48 models a swimsuit from the summer collection the model from @entity52 , @entity53 , said : ' i 've always been flat chested and wanted bigger boobs , but i would never consider anything as drastic as going under the knife			1
when i put the bikini on for the first time , it took a bit of getting used to - as i suddenly had boobs - but the effect was amazing			1
i was definitely a full two cup sizes bigger and my cleavage was really natural looking			1
' @entity2 founder @entity65 , is also pleased with the design and has already been pictured in a similar style for previous advertising campaigns			0
boob job bikini : the hot pink and cobalt blue tops cost £ 30 each - a lot less than a real boob job meanwhile the matching briefs costs £ 14 available from size 8 to 18 she said : ' this is the bikini of all bikinis			2
for girls that lack volume in the cleavage department , this is an instantaneous , natural - looking boost for the bust and as effective as a boob job			2
' the most important thing about this design is that the internal gel is light as a feather , so you barely notice the extra volume at all , but you have the benefit of being a whole two cups sizes bigger			1
for women who are an a or b cup , this is an absolute godsend and an @entity2 holiday must - have			1
' a recent survey published on @entity101 found more than half of @entity104 women hate their bodies - and would rather forgo a holiday then dare to bare in a bikini			2
these swimsuits are also part of the new collection and cost £ 40			0
the suit has a tummy control panel for anyone self - conscious about their stomach thanks to the rise of instantly sharing snaps on social media , many fear being seen not just on the beach but online in their swimwear			1
but @entity48 believes their bikini can give a self - esteem boost as well as a cleavage one to self - conscious @entity127			1
she said : ' looking good on the beach or by the pool has never been so important - and this is the perfect solution to create incredible curves			2
' the new collection also includes a swimsuit with a tummy control panel for anyone who does n't want to show off their stomach			0
@entity48 says the right fit and style is important to showcase your best assets size matters : any good swimwear brand will size by cups , so think of swimwear as an extension of your lingerie drawer - make sure that it fits properly ! it is vital for a woman to be expertly fitted on a regular basis , and i recommend every six months			1
once you know the right size , then it 's easy for you to try on different shapes and strap solutions			0
do n't be afraid to ask for assistance and let the experts advise on the best styles to boost your assets			0
experiment : swimwear is similar to a good pair of jeans - you have to try on a lot before you find one that 's " just right			1
" if you think a bikini is the only way to look sexy on the beach , think again ; a great tankini or one - piece that shows less skin can be equally flattering and look just as hot			2
there 's also lots of trickery nowadays , from gel cups to add a little boost to slimming mesh panels to streamline your silhouette			2
experiment with various shapes and styles no matter how young or old you are			0
be bold : i 'm all for experimenting with colour			0
bold shades look just beautiful in the sunshine and can really highlight a gorgeous golden tan			0
be brave and go bright ! watch your back : do n't forget to look at yourself from the back , beware of saggy bottoms or briefs that disappear when you walk - that 's not a good look			2
the backside view counts as much as the front , especially in swimwear ! @entity202 : i think every woman should invest in a good quality one piece as a basic summer staple			2
it 's a timeless piece , and although trends may come and go , this classic shape never goes out of style and will reappear in your suitcase year after year			0
shop online : if you just do n't feel comfortable stripping off and shopping for swimwear in store , why not browse online ? there ’s a lot to choose from out there so be adventurous , as you might be surprised at what suits ! order what takes your fancy or the styles that you like , and try them on in the luxury of your own home			0
although make sure to check return or exchange policies on everything you purchase online beforehand so that you can return whatever you do n't like			0
@entity233 : the glamour stakes on the beach have shot up in recent years so remember to accessorise and look out for lovely detailing in swimwear like brushed gold accents that add a little touch of luxury			0
@entity240 : so , you do n't have the body of a swimsuit model - do n't get stressed because nobody 's perfect and most people do n’t			1
downplay your less - loved parts and focus on what you do have , accentuate those bits and you ’ll feel a million dollars no matter where you are soaking up the sun this summer			0
