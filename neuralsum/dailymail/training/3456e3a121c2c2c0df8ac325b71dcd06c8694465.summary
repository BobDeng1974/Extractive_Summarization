by @entity0 and @entity1 last week @entity2 announced to the world the steps they would be taking in order to land humans on the red planet			1
and now , in a video , they 've revealed the missions , technologies and developments that will make a manned mission to @entity13 possible			1
proposals to send people to the red planet have been floating about for a while , but now the space agency has revealed how such an endeavour will be attempted in the video @entity2 highlights the development of the heavy - lift rocket known as the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) as being integral to a @entity13 mission			1
this rocket , when complete , will be the most powerful ever built - dwarfing even the @entity39 that took humans to the @entity41			0
there will be two versions of the @entity36 rocket			2
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity36 will stand 321 feet tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million poundsand carry 154,000 pounds of payload			2
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			0
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			0
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			0
the huge lifting power of the @entity36 - up to 130 ton - will enable it to take the components and fuel needed for a nine - month trip to @entity13			1
this will be accompanied by other vehicles that will carry unmanned cargo spacecraft			0
some of these could be powered by innovative means such as @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , an emerging technology that is a form of ion propulsion			0
meanwhile , advanced vehicles such as the @entity70 spacecraft will handled the manned aspects of the mission			2
on 4 december this year , @entity70 will launch on its first ever mission , completing two orbits of @entity75 without a crew before returning home			2
the mission is important as the capsule will be raised to an altitude of 3,600 miles ( 5,800 km ) , over 13 times higher than the orbit of the @entity16 this will give it a very high re-entry speed of about 20,000 miles ( 32,000 kilometres ) per hour - the fastest since the days of the @entity86 mission			2
the purpose of this will be to test the re-entry capabilities of the spacecraft , as it will need to be able to handle these speeds when returning a crew from a @entity13 mission			0
construction of the @entity16 , a key step on the path to @entity13 according to @entity2 , began at the turn of the century and is now all but complete			1
today the station is used to carry out a variety of experiments not possible on @entity75 in addition to testing capabilities that will be needed for future missions into deep space on 4 december 2014 @entity70 will launch on its first ever mission			1
the capsule will be raised to an altitude of 3,600 miles ( 5,800 kilometres ) to simulate a return from @entity13 , giving it a very high re-entry speed of about 20,000 miles ( 32,000 kilometres ) per hour - the fastest since the days of the @entity86 missions ' our next step is deep space , where @entity2 will send a robotic mission to capture and redirect an asteroid to orbit the moon , ' @entity2 said in the announcement last week			1
' astronauts aboard the @entity70 spacecraft will explore the asteroid in the 2020s , returning to @entity75 with samples			0
' this experience in human spaceflight beyond low - earth orbit will help @entity2 test new systems and capabilities , such as @entity66 , which we ’ll need to send cargo as part of human missions to @entity13			1
' a @entity133 subcommittee recently approved an authorisation bill that would allow @entity2 to redirect an asteroid into the moon ’s orbit , land astronauts there and use the asteroid as a testing outpost and way station on the way to @entity13			1
' beginning in @entity144 , @entity2 ’s powerful @entity36 rocket will enable these “ proving ground ” missions to test new capabilities , ' @entity2 said			1
' human missions to @entity13 will rely on @entity70 and an evolved version of @entity36 that will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever flown			1
' later this decade astronauts will be sent on a mission to visit and study an asteroid using the @entity70 spacecraft			0
this will enable them not only to perform key science at the asteroid , including analysing its composition and structure , but it will also prove as a test mission for journeys into deep space @entity2 's ' path to @entity13 ' graphic sets out the steps needed to send humans to an asteroid and @entity13 by the 2030s how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity170 rockets than launched man to the @entity41			1
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity175 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity175 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway the agency will now have to spell out the cost and details of the mission as part of an exploration ' roadmap ' to @entity13 that @entity2 will have to submit to @entity185			1
associate @entity2 administrator @entity186 told members of a @entity188 that the agency remains on target to launch an uncrewed mission in 2017 to test the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) rocket and @entity70 multi-purpose crew vehicle that will carry astronauts to @entity13			1
avionics testing of solid rocket boosters was completed last week at @entity197 in preparation for tests of the @entity36 rocket 's components , and acoustic testing is also underway			1
' there is real hardware in manufacture for the path to @entity13 , ' @entity186 told senators			2
' our architecture is designed for long - term human exploration of our solar system , including the goal of human missions to @entity13			1
' the hearing , called ' from here to @entity13 , ' outlined intermediate space missions being planned as steps toward long - duration space travel			1
' with the technologies and techniques we develop , we will enable expeditions to multiple destinations , ultimately allowing us to pioneer @entity13 and other destinations as we lay the groundwork for permanent human settlements in the solar system , ' @entity186 said			0
@entity2 would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide			0
they would then tow or push it towards @entity75 so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon			0
in 2021 astronauts would then use an @entity70 - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis			2
this asteroid would also , probably in the 2030s , be used as a stop - off point for astronauts on their way to @entity13			2
exact details on how @entity2 plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known , but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag			2
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity70			0
after the @entity70 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object			0
once the @entity70 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			1
after the mission is complete , @entity70 returns to @entity75 on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean – likely the @entity274 – 10 days later , as seen in the video			2
one planned mission is to a near - @entity75 asteroid , @entity186 said			0
' @entity2 will employ @entity36 and @entity70 for an early human exploration mission to perform pioneering human operations further from the @entity75 than ever before , rendezvousing with and returning samples from an asteroid redirected to at stable orbit around the @entity41 by the robotic segment of the @entity284 ( @entity285 ) , ' he explained			1
' we 're going to grab a piece of the solar system , we 're going to deflect it around the moon and insert it into a distant retrograde orbit around the moon where our crews can go visit , ' he said			0
' to think we 're moving a piece of the solar system for our use that will allow us to learn skills and techniques that we need to push the human presence into the solar system , that 's a pretty awe - inspiring statement			0
' however , the ambitious @entity13 mission could be delayed or derailed if funding from a budget - conscious @entity185 continues to erode , or if other countries ’ plans for a lunar mission force the @entity307 to change course for security reasons .			0

@entity2 has unveiled the steps they will need to take on the ' path to @entity13 '
in a new video the agency shows how new and emerging tech will be used
they highlight the @entity16 as being important for testing exploration capability
future missions of @entity70 and @entity36 will also lead humans to the red planet
this follows @entity2 's announcement to land humans on @entity13 in the 2030s
