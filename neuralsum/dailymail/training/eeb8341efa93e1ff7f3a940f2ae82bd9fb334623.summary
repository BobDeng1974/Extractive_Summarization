by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 18 may 2013 an asteroid nine times larger than the @entity3 is due to sail past the @entity4 later this month			1
luckily , the giant space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles , or 15 times the distance between the @entity4 and the moon			0
scientists have named the asteroid 1998 @entity3 but the name has nothing to do with the transatlantic @entity13 liner - it follows a code used for newly - discovered asteroids by the @entity17 @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity19			0
it was discovered on august 19 , 1998 , by the @entity26 @entity27 ( @entity27 ) programme near @entity29 , @entity30			0
the object makes its closest approach to @entity4 at 9.59pm on may 31			1
scientists plan to scan it with radar using a 230ft wide dish telescope at the @entity37 in @entity39 ’s @entity38			1
even from a distance of nearly four million miles , the researchers expect to resolve features on the asteroid as small as 12ft across			0
chief investigator dr @entity44 , from the @entity17 space agency @entity45 ’s @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity39 , said : ‘ it is tremendously exciting to see detailed images of this asteroid for the first time			0
the asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long , or nine times the length of the queen elizabeth 2 ‘ with radar we can transform an object from a point of light into a small world with its own unique set of characteristics			0
’ the asteroid will not make a return trip to the @entity4 for at least another two centuries			1
in 2016 @entity45 will launch a robotic sample return mission to one of the most potentially hazardous known near - @entity4 objects ( @entity67 ) , the asteroid ( 101955 ) @entity65			1
the asteroid , which measures a third of a mile across , comes within 500,000 kilometres of the @entity4 every six years			2
scientists have calculated that in 2182 there is a one in 1,800 chance of the object colliding with the @entity4 .			2

the asteroid will sail past the @entity4 at 9.59pm ( @entity76 time ) on may 31
it will be scanned by scientists using a 230ft wide dish telescope
