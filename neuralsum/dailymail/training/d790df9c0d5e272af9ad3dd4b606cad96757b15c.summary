the @entity0 pushed through a $ 1.1 trillion bill financing the government through september after president @entity3 phoned @entity5 lawmakers and urged them to back the measure on thursday			1
the @entity0 approved the measure late thursday by 219 - 206 , hours before a midnight deadline to avoid a government shutdown			1
although it must also pass the @entity9 and be signed into law , the @entity0 has already agreed to support the bill			1
after the measure passed in a narrow vote , house speaker @entity12 said with relief : ' thank you and @entity17			1
liberals lambasted two provisions of the massive 1,600 page joint continuing resolution and omnibus bill - being referred to as the @entity34 in @entity35 - that provided sweeteners for @entity38 and the wealthy and threatened to yank their support from final passage of the bill in a thursday afternoon vote			1
their last - minute push to block the legislation received a punch to the gut on thursday afternoon when the @entity0 came out in favor of the compromise package , but with just a few hours left to go , the president 's team still had n't wooed enough lawmakers , creating an opening for legislators unhappy with the final version of the bill			1
throughout the first part of thursday @entity5 took to the @entity0 floor to voice their displeasure with a section that would weaken restrictions on financial derivatives and another that would increase the amount of money that individuals can donate to political parties ten-fold			1
@entity69 rep. @entity68 described the first as a ' @entity38 giveaway ' and the second as way to allow @entity38 to flood the political system with more money			0
referring to the way the bill was released late tuesday evening just before midnight , @entity76 said , ' these two provisions bumped into each other somewhere in the middle of the night , in the corridors of @entity83 , up here			0
' they bumped into each other , or maybe they were introduced and one of them said i 'll be the quid , and the other one said i 'll be the quo , ' he said			0
' i do n't know which is which , but i know this is a quid pro qou , and it 's the kind of quid pro qou that is corrupting the machinery of our government and is offensive to the @entity99 people			2
' continuing , @entity76 , said			0
' we need to get rid of the quid , we need to eliminate the qou , from this bill , bring it back in a way that we can actually support it			0
that 's what we need to do for the @entity99 people			0
' earlier , @entity109 democrat @entity108 said he shared a @entity112 colleague 's concern that voting the bill down would lead to a shutdown , as the continuing resolution the government is currently operating off of will sunset at midnight			2
' the question we need to ask ourselves in this body , ' he said , ' is at what price do we keep government open ? ' @entity108 said there 's a lot of good in the legislation before the @entity0			1
but ' the notion that a price has to be paid in order to keep government open and that price is to grant greater power to the wealthiest @entity99 to have more influence over our political process is just too much for me to take , ' he said			1
a flabbergasted @entity134 said he could n't believe that of all the problems the @entity0 could use this opportunity to solve , such as increased funding for infrastructure or leveling the playing fielding for the less fortunate , it ' is deciding that the one thing we have to do is to make sure that the wealthiest @entity99 can now spend 10x more money on the political process than they did last year			2
' ' seriously ? this is a problem that we have to solve in order to keep government open ? i just ca n't imagine , ' he said			1
' i just ca n't imagine that this is the price we have to pay			0
' even as @entity5 were threatening to shred the delicately crafted bipartisan bill , house speaker @entity12 was telling reporters that he expected the bill to pass with votes from both @entity112 and @entity5			1
' it 's a good bill , and i think it reflects the people 's priorities , ' he said at a @entity83 press conference on thursday morning , later pointing out , ' listen , if we do n't get finished today , we 're gon na be here until @entity17 ! ' the @entity0 is scheduled to recess on friday until early january , but a failure to pass a new continuing resolution would force @entity21 into staying through the weekend and potentially next week			1
opposing sides : @entity0 minority leader @entity169 encouraged @entity5 to vote down the bill - despite the president asking them to support it - while @entity0 speaker @entity12 urged his colleagues to vote for it , lest they have to remain in @entity35 through the holiday season just minutes after @entity12 's press conference a procedural vote allowing the bill to come to a full vote barely passed 214 - 212 , as a group of conservative members held out their yes votes over fury that the bill did not include language prohibiting the @entity185 from implementing @entity3 's immigration orders			1
a vote on the final bill was to come later on thursday , and was expected before close of business			2
yet the @entity0 still had n't voted as of early evening as the @entity0 scrambled to whip votes			0
just as liberals and conservatives thought they may have won a second chance at debating the appropriations legislation , the @entity0 threw it 's support behind the package as is on thursday afternoon			2
@entity0 press secretary @entity197 told reporters at his daily briefing that @entity3 backs the compromise proposal and would sign it if it came to his desk			1
@entity197 said @entity3 was particularly pleased that that the bill included $ 5.4 billion to fight the spread of @entity204 and ' substantial funding at @entity3 â€™s request ' for the fight against @entity208			2
he said @entity3 was also happy to learn that the continuing resolution and omnibus bill appropriated $ 750m for early childhood education and an ' appropriate level of funding ' for climate change measures			0
in terms of what the bill does not do , he said it does n't include major @entity38 reforms that @entity112 have tried to slap onto spending legislation in the past as well as riders that would ' gut ' the @entity224 created by the 2010 @entity226 legislation , @entity227 and the president 's immigration actions			0
@entity197 said @entity5 ' should vote their conscience ' while making it clear that the president believes the compromise bill is the best option			2
meanwhile , @entity235 continued to encourage her caucus not to vote for the bill , sending them all a letter making it crystal clear what she expected of them			0
' it is clear from this recess on the floor that the @entity112 do n't have enough votes to pass the @entity34			0
this increases our leverage to get two offensive provisions of the bill removed : the bank bailout and big money for campaigns provision , ' she said			0
' however you decide to vote in the end , i thank those who continue to give us leverage to improve the bill			0

@entity261 keeps the government open through the end of the current fiscal year ; @entity21 had just hours to prevent a shut down
it passed 219 - 206 in the @entity0 but must be approved by the @entity9 and signed by the @entity0
house speaker @entity12 said he expected the bill to pass ; ' it 's a good bill , and i think it reflects the people 's priorities '
@entity0 said @entity3 would sign it if it came to his desk and *lobbied* @entity5 on thursday to vote for it
