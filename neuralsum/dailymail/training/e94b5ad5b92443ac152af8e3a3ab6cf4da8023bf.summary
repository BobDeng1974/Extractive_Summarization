miraculous recovery : ex-england batsman @entity1 claims he recovered from cancer thanks to extracts of mistletoe an international cricket career that spanned two decades , he won a reputation as a dogged and fearless batsman			1
now , @entity1 is applying the same determination to fighting cancer – with a little help from mistletoe			2
the opening batsman , who played 77 tests for @entity14 between 1963 and 1976 , has credited the experimental tumour treatment with saving his life			1
@entity1 was given just seven years to live when he was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer in 2000			2
his health deteriorated so badly by 2005 that he told his wife @entity19 he was on the brink of death			2
shortly afterwards , he heard about @entity22 , an @entity24 gp who uses injections of mistletoe extract as a cancer treatment			1
he has never looked back			2
the 75 - year - old is on the golf course three times a week and says he feels on top of the world			1
speaking from his home in @entity35 , @entity36 , mr @entity1 said : ‘ my quality of life was grim			2
i said to my wife , @entity19 , “ this is the end ”			2
i was so tired and lethargic , i could n’t do anything			2
then three or four days later a friend of a friend rang me and said i had to see dr @entity22 because his treatment had worked wonders with another patient			1
there is some evidence that compounds found in mistletoe can have an effect on cancer cells , but there is little concrete proof of its value as a treatment at present			1
scientists claim extracts from the plant : the use of mistletoe extract is widespread in @entity62 , particularly in @entity63 , but the third mistletoe symposium in that country - reported on in the @entity67 - detailed a long list of possible side effects from mistletoe , from nausea to herpes			1
the issue is also confused by the fact that mistletoe is sometimes used as a homeopathic remedy - which is never recommended as a key treatment for any type of cancer			1
‘ when i went along , i asked him whether he thought i could really get better and he said “ you will be all right , @entity1 ”			0
‘ the difference now is incredible			0
@entity81 is not the final cure , but whatever is inside it certainly helped me			0
without it , i do n’t think i would be here today			0
’ mistletoe has been touted as a cancer treatment since the 1920s and experiments show it can kill cancer cells in the lab. doubts remain however about how effective it is in the human body			1
dr @entity22 said that in some cases injections of the plant can help shrink tumours			1
other patients seem to benefit from a better quality of life , more energy or a healthier appetite			0
the doctor , who is to carry out a clinical trial of the treatment on breast cancer patients , said : ‘ @entity81 has to my experience helped a lot of patients tremendously			1
‘ but it does not work for everybody – it ’s not a miracle cure			0
we need to find out why the mistletoe works for some people , and not for others – that ’s why we need the trials			0
’ professor @entity118 , an @entity119 cancer specialist who will help run the trial , told the @entity121 : ‘ there is n’t any evidence that mistletoe does have an anti-cancer effect , in terms of prolonging the life of patients			0
unusual methods : dr @entity22 , left , a gp at @entity24 ’s @entity132 , suggested the radical treatment using the traditional winter plant , right ‘ what it does do , possibly , is improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer who are having chemotherapy			1
‘ therefore i think it ’s important to look and evaluate that and study it , in very good randomised controlled trials , conducted in a very controlled setting			0
’ mr @entity1 was diagnosed with @entity149 ’s macroglobulinemia in 2000			0
‘ i had n’t seen a doctor for about ten years , but i ’d been feeling tired for a while , ’ he said			0
‘ having taken blood tests they discovered leukaemia			1
it was quite a shock			0
you ca n’t fight it			0
‘ i think we ’ve got to be grateful for what we ’ve had			0
i did something which i loved and had the ability to play cricket at the highest level			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s fearlessness on the pitch saw him twice returning to the wicket to bat during the 1974 - 5 @entity169 tour despite having his hand and later ribs broken by balls from @entity174 fast bowler @entity173			1
he comes from a famous @entity176 sporting family and four of his cousins played first - class cricket			1
a scorer of 12 centuries for @entity14 , his best effort was 310 not out against @entity183 in 1965 .			0

treatment has been widely used in @entity62 - particularly in @entity63
*christmassy* plant may contain compounds that *affect* leukaemia cells
there is still *scepticism* in the @entity193 , however
