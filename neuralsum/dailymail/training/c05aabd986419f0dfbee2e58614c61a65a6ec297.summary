by @entity0 published : 19:38 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 19:40 est , 20 november 2012 voters are turning away from the @entity2 because of @entity4 ’s support for gay marriage , according to a poll			1
the finding casts doubt on the prime minister and @entity11 ’s claims that backing same - sex weddings will boost @entity14 chances of securing a majority at the next election			0
a @entity18 survey published today found that 62 per cent of voters and 68 per cent of @entity2 believe marriage should continue to be defined as a ‘ life - long exclusive commitment between a man and a woman ’			2
pm @entity4 ( left , pictured yesterday ) and @entity11 both support gay marriage , but a poll suggests voters do not agree in a further blow for the @entity9 , 65 per cent agree that his plans to legalise gay marriage are ‘ more to do with trying to make the @entity14 look trendy and modern ’ than a matter of conviction			1
one in four voters says gay marriage could sway their vote at the next election			1
but while 7 per cent say they are more likely to vote @entity14 , 18 per cent – more than twice as many – say they are less likely			0
more significantly , the effect is dramatically magnified among those who voted @entity14 in 2010 but say they may not do so at the next election			0
only 4 per cent of this group say they are more likely to vote @entity14 over gay marriage , while 36 per cent say they are less likely			1
that eightfold margin has increased as public discussion of the issue has intensified in recent months			0
in april the margin was just three to one			0
@entity47 : the @entity9 and the chancellor both believe the @entity14 has a better chance of re-election if they support gay marriage ( file picture ) the poll comes after the chancellor wrote a newspaper article earlier this month arguing that the @entity14 would be wrong to drop its support for gay marriage			1
only 23 per cent of all voters agree with the @entity14 leadership that gay marriage will help them win the next election , while 40 per cent disagree			1
of those who have turned away from the @entity2 since 2010 , 17 per cent agree and 56 disagree			0
the poll of more than 2,000 voters conducted over the past week also found that 63 per cent believe many of those opposed to gay marriage are reluctant to say so ‘ for fear of being called a bigot ’			1
the poll also suggested that voters see their support for legislation to allow gay people to marry as an attempt to look modern ( file picture ) by a margin of 45 to 38 per cent , voters do not think opponents of gay marriage are bigots who should be ignored			1
in another result that piles pressure on mr @entity4 , 71 per cent say ‘ marriage is important to society and should be promoted by the state ’			2
that will embolden cabinet ministers such as @entity90 who are telling mr @entity4 he must honour his long - standing pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system at the next budget , rather than waiting until 2015 as the chancellor would prefer			2
another huge majority – 69 per cent – believes children should be raised by a father and a mother in a committed permanent relationship			0
there is some solace for gay rights campaigners			2
two thirds of voters back civil partnerships for same - sex couples			0
and by a margin of 44 to 38 , voters say legalising gay marriage is important because maintaining the distinction between civil partnerships and marriage ‘ worsens public attitudes towards gay people ’			1
gay marriage is not part of the government ’s current legislative programme but all three party leaders have said they will support its introduction before the next election			1
@entity123 , campaign director of the @entity125 pressure group , said : ‘ this poll is the latest blow to a profoundly undemocratic plan that day by day is falling apart before our eyes			0
‘ [ mr @entity11 ] should concentrate on fixing @entity132 ’s broken economy instead of trying to rip up the centuries - old definition of marriage in a desperate bid to appear progressive and trendy			2
’ @entity136 , november 15			0

poll suggests most voters do *n't* share support of gay marriage
*research* also suggests @entity9 *'s* support is *cynical* attempt to look ' trendy '
