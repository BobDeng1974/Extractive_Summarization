@entity0 just keeps on finding new ways to stake his claim for status of greatest player ever			2
he 's done the two - goal games , the three - goal games , even the four - goal games ; throughout @entity7 on thursday he was being hailed for a game he did n't even score in			2
the victory over @entity10 was being seen as the most one - side 1 - 0 in the history of 1 - 0 wins and the man who set up the winner was given @entity15 in all the reports of @entity18 ’s passage to the last eight			1
it was a game in which , for once , he had broken no records … only @entity10 's spirit , with a mesmerising display that left them doubting if they were worthy of being on the same pitch as him			1
@entity0 joins in the celebrations with @entity30 and @entity31 after the first - half goal @entity0 taunts the @entity10 defence on the edge of the penalty area during a classy performance @entity0 delivered a man of the match performance as he ran the @entity10 defence ragged at the @entity39 @entity7 paper @entity40 hailed the ' @entity42 ' @entity0 after his ' masterclass ' against @entity10 that included ' nutmegs , dribbles and an assist ' , while he also featured on the front cover of @entity48 @entity0 does that to opponents , not just bamboozling them with skill but undermining any confidence they may have that they can live with him			1
' the best i 've ever seen ' said @entity55 and @entity56 called it ‘ another recital ’ but in truth players do n’t like what ’s known as ‘ the @entity0 question ’ because whatever answer they give is going to be inadequate alongside the man they are trying to describe			2
‘ i 'm just glad he plays for us said @entity67 '			0
the two nutmegs – one on @entity70 and one on @entity72 – reminded many of something the coach said before he managed @entity18			0
he said that @entity0 stands out from the rest not because he necessarily does anything different to other players , but that he does it in big games against big name rivals			0
all footballers grow up being able to belittle far inferior rivals – they do it on the school playground against other kids first , then in youth academies against youngsters with less talent , and then eventually in training as senior professionals against the reserve - team centre - backs			0
but @entity0 , in contrast , does it against internationals in big matches all the time			0
@entity72 approaches @entity18 star @entity0 during their @entity98 tie on wednesday @entity0 slips the ball through @entity10 midfielder @entity72 's legs at the @entity39 it ’s easy to laugh at his @entity10 victims but they are just two more of a long line as @entity0 takes playground football on to the big stage and runs rings around everybody just as in those grainy videos of him aged six and seven playing @entity109 in @entity110			1
it was fitting that @entity112 was looking on on wednesday night			0
the @entity114 coach was there with a view to scouting potential quarter - final opponents			0
it was @entity112 who transformed @entity0 from a wide attacker in @entity18 's front three to a deep - lying attacker – the famous false nine			1
anyone who thought that would be the last @entity0 innovation was wrong – who knows where the @entity125 was playing last night ? he now has complete freedom to go where he wants on the pitch and spends large chunks of games with a deep right - sided midfield spot as his starting position			0
that was where he found himself when he seemed to draw the entire @entity10 side to him in the first half , just before he released @entity30 for the goal that won the game on the night for @entity18			1
@entity72 slides as @entity0 nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their @entity98 match former @entity18 manager @entity112 reacts to the nutmeg in the stands at the @entity39 @entity114 manager @entity112 reacts to the ridiculous skill from @entity0 during the @entity18 match the new ‘ more roving than ever ’ role even begs the question is it time for coaches to start trying to man - mark him ? that in turn begs another question – would he have been so good in the age of cynical man - marking that allowed hatchet - men to scythe down great players without punishment ? that variable always needs to be factored - in to comparisons between him and @entity161			1
on thursday in @entity18 the over-riding sentiment was : it ’s good that football is not like that anymore , and we can enjoy @entity0 the magician to the absolute maximum .			2
