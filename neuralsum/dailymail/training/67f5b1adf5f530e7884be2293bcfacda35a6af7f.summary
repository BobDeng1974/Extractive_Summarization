by @entity0 published : 14:22 est , 7 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:23 est , 7 december 2013 prince @entity5 ’s dream of winning a 200 - mile race across the @entity7 has been shattered by a string of injuries among the team and safety fears , it was announced last night			1
instead of racing to the @entity12 , @entity5 and his companions will continue trekking to their destination over less dangerous terrain			2
announcing last night that the team was no longer racing , expedition director @entity17 admitted that the terrain , weather and altitude – 8,000ft above sea - level – had got the better of everyone			1
@entity5 and his companions have endured temperatures as low as @entity53 , as well as altitude sickness – which caused one of the guides to withdraw with breathing difficulties			0
a spate of injuries have been caused by pulling 200lb sledges across a landscape of sharp ice ridges , each 3ft high			0
guide @entity63 , who has been exploring polar landscapes for 25 years , had to pull out last week when water began seeping into his lungs			0
at the time he said he ‘ felt terrible ’ and could n’t get any air ’			0
one group : the three teams will now arrive in the @entity12 as one group rather than competing against each other to reach the finish line first tough conditions : @entity73 , a member of @entity35 , is pictured trudging through the snow during the walking with the wounded challenge one of @entity5 ’s companions , @entity77 , 34 , said : ‘ people have been suffering big time			1
most people have got horrible dry , hacking coughs due to the weather			0
’ in a statement on the charity ’s website last night , @entity17 said : ‘ it became obvious that underneath the concrete determination of all the team members , the harsh reality of the @entity7 was starting to take its toll			1
‘ it was becoming evident that there was a higher degree of stress imposed on the team members , due to unprecedented terrain on the plateau			0
‘ with careful consultation from our doctor and the race team , we have put the race on hold			2
‘ the reason for this is entirely simple – safety , which remains the core principle of our expeditions			0
’ inspiring : every one of the prince 's team - mates has lost at least one limb serving in @entity112 prince @entity5 , pictured on the first day of the trek on december 1 , and his teammates are expected to complete the challenge on december 17 @entity17 ’s decision was backed by @entity5 ’s team leader , @entity118 , who described the first four days of the trek as a ‘ full - out slog ’			1
many marchers suffered injuries that slowed them down until they fell behind the schedule set for the march			2
@entity118 insisted that morale remained high			0
today , prince @entity5 and the teams , which also include the actors @entity127 and @entity129 , will continue their trek along a different route to the @entity12 , with each team completing the 70 miles in its own time			1
the course is expected to take the marchers around seven days			2
mr @entity17 added : ‘ i strongly believe that by friday or saturday every member of the expedition will be standing on the @entity12 , celebrating what will have been the most extraordinary journey			1
’ at the start line : it was uncertain whether the trip would ever begin after blizzards blighted initial preparation and left @entity5 and his team largely confined to their rooms getting ready : prince @entity5 and the walking with the wounded teams pictured at they headed to the starting point for the race team @entity42 members ( r - l ) prince @entity5 , @entity152 , @entity118 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity77			1

walking with the wounded teams set off on the 208 - mile trek on *sunday*
but conditions have been ' very difficult ' and ' far harder ' than expected
expedition director @entity17 has taken the decision to suspend the race
the three teams from the @entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity35 will now finish the challenge together
