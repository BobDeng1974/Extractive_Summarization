the general consensus up until the late 20th century was that after @entity3 ’s formation 4.54 billion years ago , the planet was a hellish place covered in magma			1
but now scientists say conditions on @entity3 for the first 500 million years after it formed may have been surprisingly similar to the present day complete with oceans and even continents			1
researchers say that ancient rocks in @entity12 indicate that early @entity3 had a more moderate temperature and was more hospitable than thought			1
researchers at @entity16 in @entity17 say that the young @entity3 ( pictured from space on the @entity19 in 2007 ) might not have been inhospitable to life			1
it had been thought that in its first 500 million years after its formation 4.54 billion years ago our planet was covered in magma and was a hellish place the study was conducted by a team of geologists from @entity16 in @entity17			1
they examined a long - standing theory that modern @entity12 is an analogue of the early @entity3			2
previously it had been thought that @entity12 ’s crust , which formed from magma that is much hotter than anywhere else on the planet , was similar to @entity3 ’s in its first 500 million years			1
however in the study the researchers examined zircons - crystals that have existed almost since @entity3 ’s formation - in @entity12			2
the first 500 million years of the @entity3 's life are known as the @entity44			2
although this time amounts to more than 10 percent of @entity3 's history , little is known about it , since few rocks are known that are older than 3.8 billion years old			0
for much of the @entity44 , @entity3 and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts			0
and they found that while the zircons on @entity12 were indicative of a hot formation , they did not match the composition of zircons found elsewhere on @entity3			2
this suggest that @entity12 is not a model for the young @entity3 - and instead @entity3 4 billion years ago was not as hellish as thought			1
‘ we discovered that @entity12 zircons are quite distinctive from crystals formed in other locations on modern @entity3 , ’ explained @entity16 doctoral student @entity63 who was part of the study			2
‘ we also found that they formed in magmas that are remarkably different from those in which the @entity44 zircons grew			0
’ analysis of zircon crystals - remants of the ancient @entity3 - in @entity12 suggests our planet was hospitable early in its formation			1
shown are images of a collection of @entity12 zircons taken with a scanning electron microscope			0
they range in size from a tenth of a millimeter to a few thousandths of a millimeter the researchers found that while zircons on @entity12 grew from hot magma , they did not match zircons found elsewhere on @entity3 , suggesting @entity12 was not an analogue of the young @entity3			1
pictured is professor @entity94 , who led the study , at the @entity97 volcano in central @entity12 @entity63 collected samples from volcanoes and sands derived from the erosion of @entity12 volcanoes			0
she separated thousands of zircon crystals from the samples , which cover the island 's regional diversity and represent its 18 million year history			0
together with other scientists she analysed about 1,000 zircon crystals for their age and elemental isotopic compositions			0
most importantly , their analysis found that @entity12 zircons grew from much hotter magmas than @entity44 zircons			0
although surface water played an important role in the generation of both @entity12 and @entity44 crystals , in the @entity12 case the water was extremely hot when it interacted with the source rocks			0
by comparison , the @entity44 water - rock interactions were at significantly lower temperatures			0
‘ our conclusion is counterintuitive , ’ said professor @entity94 , who led the study			0
‘ @entity44 zircons grew from magmas rather similar to those formed in modern subduction zones , but apparently even " cooler " and " wetter " than those being produced today			0
’ the researchers would suggest @entity12 is not an analogue of @entity3 , and instead our young planet may have had more moderate temperatures as opposed to being a hellish place as shown in this illustration			1
this means that in its first 500 million years continents and even oceans could have formed on the surface of @entity3			1

researchers at @entity16 in @entity17 say that the young @entity3 might not have been inhospitable to life
it had been thought that in its first 500 million years after its formation 4.54 billion years ago our planet was covered in magma and was a hellish place
but analysis of zircon crystals in @entity12 suggests this is not the case
zircons are ancient *remnants* of @entity3 left over from its formation
scientists had thought @entity12 was an analogue of early @entity3 owing to its crust being hotter than elsewhere on the planet
but they found that while zircons on @entity12 grew from hot magma , they did not match zircons found elsewhere on @entity3
this would suggest @entity12 is not an analogue of @entity3 , and instead our young planet may have had more moderate temperatures
this means in its first 500 million years continents and even oceans could have formed on its surface
