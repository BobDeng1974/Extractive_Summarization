by @entity0 @entity3 's independent supporters ' club has joined a legal action being taken by a @entity6 agent against @entity8 's financial fair play rules			1

@entity3 supporters have joined legal action against financial fair play rules despite a fine and restrictions , the @entity28 champions still bought @entity31 for £ 32m the action claims the @entity9 rules contravene @entity34 ( @entity34 ) laws including the right to free competition			1
a statement from @entity38 , which has almost 15,000 active members and 168 branches worldwide , said : ' our members are consumers of the football product and it is as such that they denounce the @entity34 competition law infringements caused by the @entity8 break - even requirement			2
' far from implementing a true ' financial fair play ' , this rule is in fact a prohibition to invest that prevents ambitious owners to develop their clubs , that therefore shields the established @entity55 elite from being challenged ( this elite being unsurprisingly the main sponsors of the @entity8 rule ) and that , consequently , puts additional financial pressure on supporters ( higher prices and lower quality )			0
big spending @entity17 have also been hit heavily by @entity8 's new regulations ' with this @entity8 rule , it is now almost impossible for any ambitious investor to take over a ' sleeping giant ' and to turn them into the next @entity3 or @entity17			2
' in other words , the @entity8 rule may be bad news for @entity38 supporters , but it is even worse news for supporters of all clubs that do not today belong to the established @entity55 elite			0
' the legal action was brought by agent @entity76 and is being led by lawyer @entity77 , part of the legal team that won the @entity81 ruling in the 1990s .			0
