choking smog engulfed one of northeastern @entity3 's largest cities last week , causing @entity3 authorities to shut down the city			1
the incredible amounts of smog in @entity8 - a city of more than 10 million people – meant that visibility was reduced to less than 10 metres			1
the smog forced schools to suspend classes , caused snarling traffic and closed the airport , in what was the country 's first major air pollution crisis of the winter			1
the thick haze of smog is clearly visible as the murky grey colour in this @entity32 image from the @entity34 satellite now , the latest satellite images from @entity37 ’s @entity34 - @entity34 satellite show the startling extend of @entity3 ’s smog problem			1
measurements taken on october 20 , 2013 , scored the air quality index ( @entity41 ) in the city at 500 , the highest possible reading			2
levels above 300 are considered hazardous to human health			0
the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) on the @entity48 satellite acquired a natural - colour image of northeastern @entity3 on october 21 , 2013			1
the brightest areas in this image are fog , which has a tinge of grey or yellow due to the air pollution			1
other cloud - free areas have a pall of grey and brown smog that blots out the city and surrounding towns this image show the dramatic increase in air quality worsened during the october 15 - 19 , 2013 period			1
two - day averages are used to provide an increased amount of data , reducing missing data from gaps between instrument scanning swaths or due to clouds the brightest areas are fog , which has a tinge of grey or yellow due to the air pollution			1
other cloud - free areas have a pall of gray and brown smog that blots out the city and surrounding towns			1
some neighborhoods experienced concentrations of fine particulate matter ( @entity87 ) as high as 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter			0
for comparison , the @entity91 @entity90 ’s air quality standards say @entity87 should remain below 35 micrograms per cubic meter			2

each red dot indicates a fire detected by the fire - sensitive infrared radiation band of @entity46			0
the @entity105 is visible at top right			0
smoke from the fires is visible as a greyish haze as it accumulates on the central coastal plain @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity8 are located on @entity3 's coastal plains , to the east of mountain ranges and land at higher elevations it is extremely rare for particulate levels to reach that high in the absence of a dust storm or forest fire			2
a few days after pollution levels started to rise , @entity8 hospitals reported a 30 per cent increase in admissions related to respiratory problems , and several @entity8 pharmacies were sold out of pollution facemasks , according to media reports			2
cold weather and the lack of wind helped fuel the pollution outbreak , but human factors also played an important role			0
wheat and corn farmers in the region light fires in the fall to burn off debris following the harvest			0
a true - colour @entity46 - @entity48 image of central @entity3 , acquired on october 3 , 2013 , shows the numerous fires adding smoke and soot to the atmosphere over @entity3			2
air quality in @entity3 cities is of increasing concern to @entity3 's stability - obsessed leadership because it plays into popular resentment over political privilege and rising inequality in the world 's second - largest economy			0
domestic media have run stories describing the expensive air purifiers government officials enjoy in their homes and offices , alongside reports of special organic farms so cadres need not risk suffering from recurring food safety scandals			0
the government has announced plans over the years to tackle the pollution problem but has made little apparent progress			0

smog is visible as murky grey colour shown in @entity34 satellite image
