click here to see all the stats from the big game with our brilliant @entity3 if @entity7 fans were wondering what they may be missing from @entity9 , the answer is the same old feints and flicks ... accompanied by an ultimate sense of frustration			1
it 's fair to say that the @entity16 winger failed to live up to expectations at @entity18 before agreeing a loan move back to his former club @entity20			0
he was back in action against @entity24 opposition when @entity25 travelled to the @entity26 for their @entity28 group @entity29 - with contrasting performances in each half			2
@entity9 was practically anonymous during the first half back came to life in the second half against @entity25 @entity9 was left ultimately frustrated at the end of the game , a feeling @entity7 fans will remember the @entity20 winger practices ahead of the @entity28 clash with @entity25 0 - 5mins : the 27 - year - old started on the wing - where he has spent most of his career at both club and international level playing under the shadow of another @entity20 alumni @entity47 - and his first touch involved a typically jinking move that ultimately lacked an end product			1
9mins : @entity9 temporarily switched wings with @entity52 , who had been the more impressive going forward on the rare occasion that @entity20 managed to break , but struggled to get any time on the ball as @entity25 dominated early proceedings			2
18min : as elder statesman , @entity9 's younger teammates repeatedly tried to search him out in what appeared to be a free role across the front			0
his simple pass to @entity62 led to a scoring opportunity wasted by @entity64 - but @entity9 lost possession only moments later and @entity20 were fortunate that @entity66 was in another profligate mood			0
the former @entity7 forward struggles to find a way past @entity70 on the wing @entity9 exchanges pleasantries with fellow @entity16 and @entity25 manager @entity73 33mins : not one renowned for his defensive capabilities , @entity9 was nowhere to be seen as former @entity76 midfielder @entity75 opened the scoring with a solid header from a floated cross by @entity80			1
37mins : @entity9 attempted to beat @entity81 for pace down the left touchline in a battle re-enacted from his time in @entity86 , but the @entity25 defender used his strength to usher the ball out for a goal kick			0
41mins : as half - time approached , the closest @entity9 came to being compared with @entity47 is petulantly complaining with his hands on his hips when @entity94 opted for a shot instead of passing to him			0
@entity96 : @entity7 fans will recognise a first - half performance that saw @entity9 roam freely around the pitch playing subtle passes without actually imposing himself on the game or penetrating the areas that matter			1
@entity9 receives close attention from @entity25 's @entity75 ( c ) and @entity81 ( @entity104 ) @entity9 played in a free role without penetrating in the first - half - click here for more @entity3 stats @entity9 's first - half heat map shows him flitting around the pitch without influencing the danger areas @entity75 ( @entity104 ) opened the scoring with a header in the first - half with @entity9 nowhere to be seen 47mins : @entity9 took his first shot with a whipped effort from a standing position that raised the commentator 's voice before a different angle revealed the ball swerving well wide of @entity122 ' goal			1
49mins : in a move that perfectly illustrates why @entity9 frustrates , he raced down the left wing after taking the ball in his stride with a beautifully deft touch but , once inside @entity25 's penalty area with options available , he decided on a back heel ... after confusing the referee for a teammate ! 50mins : @entity20 definitely looked more dangerous after the interval and @entity9 saw far more of the ball			1
another raid down the left was halted by a shove from @entity136 that was seen by everyone except the referee who failed to award a deserved free - kick on the edge of the area			0
@entity9 takes down the ball with a deft touch before racing past @entity80 ( r ) @entity9 's general ( @entity104 ) and attack ( r ) statistics from the game reveal no crosses or shots on target the @entity20 winger is easily shrugged off the ball by the more robust @entity25 defender @entity81 54mins : @entity9 missed a superb chance to level the scoring after racing on to a loose ball on the left of the penalty area but his composure deserted him with @entity122 racing out and the ball could only find the side netting			1
60mins : a nicely placed free - kick was lifted tamely into the wall by @entity9 before he lost possession from the rebound and almost allowed @entity25 another break away before @entity163 was cynically brought down			0
65mins : @entity9 tried to switch play with a raking cross field pass to @entity52 but it was slightly over hit , allowing @entity168 to cover enough ground to intercept			0
the 27 - year - old does his best @entity47 impression after teammates fail to find him with a pass @entity9 misses a chance at the beginning of the second half after latching on to a loose ball in the box 71mins : @entity179 is cautioned for tripping @entity9 from behind as @entity20 continue their second half resurgence			2
78mins : @entity9 conceded a free - kick after tumbling over @entity182 on the byline in a rare show of tracking back			0
81mins : the @entity16 winger had another shot but could not get enough pace or direction on the ball to trouble @entity122 86mins : in his best effort of the night , @entity9 cut inside from the right and ghosted past three defenders before unleashing a superb dipping effort that sailed agonisingly over the crossbar			0
ft : @entity20 and @entity9 came to life at the beginning of the second half with the winger seeing far more of the ball and dictating more of the play while coming close with a couple of decent efforts			2
however , none were on target while his final product still leaves much to be desired - and @entity7 fans wo n't be losing any sleep after a typical performance coined by inconsistency			1
@entity9 was far more influential in the second half , especially from the left where he had most of his chances @entity9 and @entity81 share mutual respect after @entity25 win the @entity28 clash 1 - 0 @entity9 is comforted by @entity25 keeper @entity122 after failing to register a shot on target			1

@entity25 defeated @entity20 1 - 0 in their @entity28 clash
@entity75 scored the winner with a header from @entity80 ' cross
*ex-manchester* @entity7 winger @entity9 was virtually anonymous in first - half
@entity16 was more influential after the interval but ultimately frustrated with his final product
