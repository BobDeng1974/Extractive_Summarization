@entity0 may not want to compare this @entity2 team to others he has been involved with , but the long - serving goalkeeper believes they have ' huge potential ' this season			1
@entity8 's men have been the campaign 's most impressive side , with last weekend 's loss at @entity12 their only defeat in 24 matches in all competitions			0
that ended talk of the west @entity18 going through the season unbeaten , yet they remain top of the @entity21 after continuing their 100 per cent record at @entity23 by overcoming @entity24 2 - 0 on saturday			1
@entity0 gives out instructions to his @entity2 team - mates in a rare appearance for the veteran keeper an injury to @entity30 saw @entity0 make his first top - flight start of the season against the @entity33 , with the @entity35 ' dominating throughout despite their display lacking the panache of other matches			1
' you always look for a response when you have a game when you do n't win and it is not going the way you want , ' @entity0 said			2
' you need to find a way to win the next game			0
it was not an easy one but we managed to get a good result out of that and we controlled it for most of the game because @entity24 did n't have a shot on target			2
' it is obviously nice to have the game time and the most pleasant part is to have the clean sheet and three points because @entity24 made it hard for us although we had a good start			2
' we scored an early goal but for a long time in the game it was just 1 - 0			1
the second goal obviously made a big difference and with the sending off we could control the game			0
' @entity30 has been @entity8 's no 1 between the sticks for @entity2 this season while it was not the impressive display @entity2 fans have become accustomed to , there were flashes of the quality which makes them favourites to add to their haul of four league titles			1
@entity0 was between the sticks for three of those triumphs and , while not keen to compare this team to others , believes they can achieve something special			2
' we only judge the team when the season is finished and you can see how many trophies the team has in hand , ' the 32 - year - old told the official club website , www.chelseafc.com			1
' it is difficult to say which @entity2 side in history was the best because a lot of them won trophies			0
' this team has huge potential , it has been doing really well this season , we are top of the league and have been doing some brilliant games but we are empty - handed at the moment , and i do n't like to compare the teams until the season is finished			1
' @entity2 's first chance of a trophy comes in the @entity108 , with @entity0 likely to remain in goal for tuesday 's quarter - final at @entity111			1
@entity0 waves to the @entity2 faithful after the @entity35 kept up their excellent form with a win against @entity24 @entity117 's side are amongst those vying for promotion from the @entity120 - a division @entity24 could soon find themselves unless they buck up their ideas			1
the @entity33 have not won a league match in nine attempts and could do with a moment of magic to turn decent displays into three points			0
such inspiration is unlikely to come from the boots of @entity130 , though			0
@entity131 is unsure whether @entity132 will play for @entity24 again after the playmaker 's exodus an exciting deadline - day loan signing from @entity12 , the 27 - year - old has become persona non grata at the @entity138 and has been omitted from the squad since last month 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity141			1
@entity131 retains there has been no bust - up with @entity130 , although does not expect him to don the amber and black shirt again			0
' to be honest , i do n't know if @entity130 is in @entity148 , ' the @entity24 boss said in response to reports the midfielder has returned home			2
' that 's the truth			0
the playmaker - on loan from @entity12 - has failed to impress for @entity131 's side ' as for not playing again for @entity24 , then at the moment he 's not in the squad and the transfer window opens in january			0
' there are still conversations to be had with him , but at the moment he is not in the squad and he has n't earned the right to be in the squad at the moment			0
' i do n't know if the report that he is in @entity170 , or whatever it is , is true			0

@entity2 maintained their three - point lead at the top of the @entity21 with a 2 - 0 win against @entity24 on saturday
@entity0 made a rare appearance with no 1 @entity30 out injured
the 32 - year - old says the *current* @entity2 team has ' huge potential '
however , @entity0 says the team ca n't be compared to other @entity2 sides he has been involved with until the end of the season
