by @entity0 published : 19:28 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 01:49 est , 20 june 2013 a cast of @entity4 's death mask has sold for almost £ 170,000 at auction after spending years stored in a family attic			1
the mask was made for a @entity10 chaplain shortly after the @entity13 emperor ’s death on the @entity15 island of @entity16 in 1821 , where he was exiled			1
the rare find went under the hammer at @entity19 , @entity20 and manuscript sale in @entity22 , central @entity23 , yesterday and sold for £ 169,250 - well above its estimate of £ 40,000 to £ 60,000			1
under the hammer : the mask ( cast , pictured left ) was made for a @entity10 chaplain shortly after @entity13 emperor @entity4 's ( right ) death on the @entity15 island of @entity16 in 1821 , where he was exiled known as the ' @entity32 ' , it was made for the reverend @entity33 , senior chaplain of @entity16 , two days after @entity4 's death - and when the @entity38 's body was beginning to decompose			1
it was sold by @entity40 , a direct descendent of the original owner 's brother , who was left it in a family member 's will			1
after years of being stored in the attic of his home , @entity48 boys decided to sell it			1
the cast is classed as the most significant example of its kind remaining in private hands			2
all but one of the other examples are in national collections in @entity13			0
@entity40 said for years he did not know what to do the cast , adding : ‘ at a family funeral i was rather surprised and taken aback , to hear that i had been left this mask			1
‘ after a while i realised its significance but i was not sure what to do with it beyond ensuring its safety			0
to date it has been confined to an attic but i most definitely did not want this to happen for another generation			2
‘ i came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to offer it for sale in the hope that , as a result , it was something more people would then be able to see and enjoy ’			2
rare : known as the ' boys cast ' , it was made for the reverend @entity33 , senior chaplain of @entity16 , two days after @entity4 's death - and when the @entity38 's body was beginning to decompose after @entity4 's death , there was a protracted wrangle over whether his physician , @entity94 , or the @entity10 doctor , @entity96 , should make a death mask			1
practical difficulties also meant this was not done until two days after the former @entity38 had died			0
the mask was given to @entity101 by the portrait painter , @entity103 , who helped mr @entity94 to make the mask			0
rev boys received it before @entity4 's entourage left the island			2
@entity4 , who was exiled to @entity109 , @entity110 , after defeat in 1814 , escaped and returned to @entity13 before being beaten again at the @entity112 in 1815 and imprisoned by the @entity10 on @entity16			1
he was supported by @entity113 , which was backed by him when it was trying to gain independence from @entity115 , and had ambitions of a new empire in @entity118 or @entity119			0
but @entity4 was one on the most closely guarded prisoners of all time , with a strong @entity123 squadron of 11 ships patrolling the @entity15 island where he was kept 1,200 miles from the nearest land			0
plots to rescue him included those using yachts , steamboats and balloons - and one was said to have even involved a submarine			0
the escape plans were hatched despite @entity4 being confined to an astonishingly secure prison for the era , which was guarded by 2,800 men and 500 cannon on its handful of possible landing ports			0
he spent six years on the heavily - guarded island , in the refurbished @entity143 mansion , where visitors were thoroughly questioned and searched , before dying in may 1821 , apparently of cancer			2
it is inscribed ' @entity147 ' on the inside of the cast - and comes with a note by boys , reading : ‘ this @entity151 was taken from the face of @entity4 as he lay dead at @entity153 7th may 1821 which i do hereby certify / @entity158 chaplain / @entity156			1
’ @entity150 is recorded as having played chess with @entity4 and is said to have brought several mementos of the @entity13 with him on his return to @entity162 eight years later			0
he was a strict moralist who made himself unpopular by preaching sermons against the loose living of senior members of the @entity10 garrison			2
as a result he was said to have been viewed as something of a liability by the @entity10 authorities and well - regarded by the @entity13 contingent on the @entity174			0
this may explain why he managed to get hold of such an intimate memento of the @entity38 as this impression of his death mask			0
@entity19 spokesman @entity180 said : ‘ this mask is a fascinating reflection on the nature of power and its projection			2
‘ by the time the cast for the mask was made @entity4 's body had begun to decompose in the fierce heat and , as was noted at the time , his features had changed quite markedly			1
‘ the very last image we have of @entity4 , therefore , is more that of a saint than the man of action and resolution carefully engineered in the portraits painted during his lifetime			0
' @entity19 consultant @entity199 added : ‘ before the invention of photography , taking a cast from a person 's face was the one way of producing what may be described as an objective likeness			1
these masks were most often taken after death			0
' in this they became part of the funerary rites of the dead , the royal dead especially - royal death masks can be traced back to at least the time of @entity216			0
‘ the present death mask of @entity4 can be seen as standing at the end of this long tradition - the world 's first photograph was to be taken only five years later ’ .			1
