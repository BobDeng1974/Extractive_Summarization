the trial of disgraced @entity3 private @entity1 has revealed troubling information about the may , 2011 , raid on @entity8 's @entity7 hideout : one of the raid members - presumably a @entity13 member - suffered memory loss stemming from ' repetitive ' traumatic brain injury			1
the raid member , identified only as ' @entity16 , ' may testify at @entity1 's trial to demonstrate that files that @entity1 released to @entity19 ended up in @entity8 's possession , as they were found inside his @entity22 , @entity7 , complex when it was raided by members of @entity25			1
traitor ? manning is escorted out of a courthouse monday , the fourth day of his court martial according to a filing in @entity1 's court marshal , the presumed seal has ' occasional short - term memory deficiencies , ' like forgetting where he put his car keys			1
the memory issues , the raid member says , started two to three years ago , which means he would have suffered from the memory issues prior to the raid on the terror mastermind 's compound			2
the raid member , however , says the memory issues ' do not impact my life in any discernible way ' and have not effected his memory of the raid that killed @entity8			2
the memory issues arose as prosecutors plan to argue that @entity52 and the @entity54 's diplomatic cables that were leaked by @entity1 were found in @entity8 's compound in an attempt to prove that the leaks were a direct threat to @entity60 security			1
the raid member 's testimony presumably would be used to establish a chain of custody of the documents found in the compound			2
life : the @entity3 private @entity68 faces life in prison if he 's convicted of the most serious charges against him @entity1 's trial , which is heading into its fifth day , comes three years after the @entity3 private first class was first arrested for allegedly stealing classified government documents and giving them to the anti-secrecy website			1
in all , @entity1 , 25 , faces charges of larceny , aiding the enemy and violating the @entity80 , as well as 10 lesser counts - such as improper handling of classified information and impeding the order and discipline of the military - on which he already has pleaded guilty			1
manning has been considered both a hero and a traitor after his may , 2010 arrest for giving the sensitive government materials to @entity19 - his supporters say he is a ' political prisoner ' who simply shed light on serious problems within the military and the @entity60 government as a whole			0
his critics say he put @entity60 lives at risk by distributing military secrets that could help enemies of the @entity60 kill soldiers			0
@entity19 attorney @entity106 takes a break outside of the courthouse during the fourth day of @entity1 's trial of the items @entity1 is alleged to have stolen and given to the website are more than 250,000 diplomatic cables , more than 500,000 @entity3 battlefield logs , and videos of airstrikes in @entity115 and @entity116 , @entity117 , during which soldiers are heard making disparaging remarks about the men they had just killed			2
@entity1 says he stole the information after becoming disillusioned with @entity60 actions in @entity124 and @entity117 , and a policy geared towards ' killing and capturing people			0
' ' they dehumanized the individuals they were engaging and seemed to not value human life , and referred to them as , quote - unquote , dead bastards , ' @entity1 said of the video of the airstrikes , noting the ' blood lust ' the soldiers appear to show by their comments			0
@entity137 human - rights lawyer @entity106 has been a member of a legal team representing @entity139 and @entity19 in @entity140 and has been attending the court marshal @entity1 's attorney , @entity142 , issued a brief statement on his website prior to this week 's court marshal			1
it reads in part , " on behalf of both myself and @entity68			0
@entity1 , i would like to thank everyone for their continued support over the last three years			0
" he also thanks supporters for raising money and awareness of the case			0
@entity142 has made few public statements during the @entity1 case			0
if convicted of the more serious charges , @entity1 faces up to life in prison .			1

the raid member might be called to testify in @entity1 's court marshal to show that documents he leaked to @entity19 were found in @entity8 's @entity7 hideout
@entity1 faces charges of larceny , aiding the enemy and violating the @entity80 , as well as 10 lesser counts
if convicted , @entity1 could spend the rest of his life in prison
