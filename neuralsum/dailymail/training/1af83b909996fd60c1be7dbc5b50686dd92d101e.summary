' yes it is real ' : @entity1 , pictured , has seen atrocities from inside @entity3 i have just returned from a secret visit to @entity6 – once the largest @entity8 town in @entity3 , but no longer			1
today , @entity6 stands 90 per cent empty , desecrated by the gunmen of the fanatical islamic state terror group now in control			1
the majority of the town ’s 50,000 people have fled , fearing that , like other @entity8 in this region , they will be massacred			1
the militants , in a further act of sacrilege , have established their administrative posts in the abandoned churches			1
my visit , under the noses of the gunmen , was frightening – but that is nothing to the terror of the poor souls left behind			1
since i went to @entity30 ’s @entity29 church in @entity31 in 2003 – the only @entity29 church in the city – i have seen countless terrible things			1
many of my congregation have been killed or mutilated in the years of violence			1
but i have never witnessed anything on the scale , or which has affected me quite so dreadfully as on this visit to the north of @entity3			1
in the nearby city of @entity43 , i found many of those @entity8 who had fled			1
some 30,000 refugees are packed into the @entity47 capital , forming a new @entity8 suburb			1
i spoke to one woman who had survived the massacres in @entity6			1
she had a bandaged left hand			1
when is soldiers could not remove her gold wedding ring , they had simply hacked off her finger			1
she wept as she told me			1
the refugees are now penniless , robbed of their homes and possessions			1
christian houses were daubed with the letter ‘ n ’ for @entity62 and given to @entity64 families			2
i met @entity65 , who used to be the caretaker of my church in @entity31 , and fought to stay dry - eyed as he told me the fate of his youngest son , aged five			2
the boy was chopped in half in front of @entity65 ’s eyes during an is attack			2
hunted : @entity3 @entity8 - whose ties to the land are ancient - have been hounded from their homes and threatened with death if they do not convert the family had moved north to @entity6 when @entity65 , who was a founding member of my church , retired			2
i baptised his remaining children there in @entity43			2
the murdered little boy had been named @entity84 , after me			2
i cry now every time i think of him			2
people say to me : ‘ is it really as terrible as this ? can these atrocities be real ? ’ i tell them : ‘ yes			2
it is as real and terrible as this			2
’ @entity6 has become a place of terror			2
its people were shot and some – already dead – were ‘ crucified ’ , a final humiliation and an outrage against the individual , and the faith they had refused to abandon			0
i am sorry to say that i have seen the pictures printed on these pages , and am sickened			0
now @entity43 fears it too will fall to the @entity105 , as they expand what they claim is a new caliphate			0
and without @entity43 there is no hope for the @entity8			0
they are running out of places to go			0
what is happening in northern @entity3 is almost unimaginable			0
part of my purpose on this journey was to help feed and clothe this desperate population , using £ 300,000 from the @entity117 in the @entity118 , and other generous individuals			0
persecuted : @entity3 @entity8 families forced to flee their home shelter in the @entity122 in @entity43 , northern @entity3 yet it feels that we are alone			0
where is the response of the @entity127 ? we have seen nothing on the ground			1
members of the worldwide @entity117 are praying over this devastating situation			0
but there is a desperate need for practical action , too : these people need mattresses , clothes , blankets and food			0
families are crammed into churches to sleep on the floors			0
we must also ask : ‘ what next ? ’ @entity3 ’s @entity8 ca n’t stay in @entity47 forever			0
at some point they must be rescued and relocated			0
they will flee to @entity148 , then @entity149 , @entity150 or @entity151			1
@entity118 has said it will not take one @entity3 refugee			0
the people of this region have had their homes burned and destroyed before			0
each time the @entity8 have survived and fought back , returning to rebuild desecrated churches and their lives			1
it is hard to see , however , that this will happen this time			0
where is their protection ? it is a terrible thing to wish , but i now believe that military action of some sort is necessary , if only to reduce the movement of @entity168 tanks , their soldiers , and their power and authority on the ground			1
even this is not the solution in the long run			0
we need money , and we need prayer			0
without those we have nothing			0
those wanting to donate can do so at the website of the @entity184 : @entity181			0

*president* said the speed of the @entity189 advance was *surprising* , and there is no quick fix for the *problem*
but was *definitive* that @entity151 would not be *dragged* back into ground *confrontations* in the country
@entity151 military sources revealed that more strikes had been made against @entity168 *mortars* and convoys
