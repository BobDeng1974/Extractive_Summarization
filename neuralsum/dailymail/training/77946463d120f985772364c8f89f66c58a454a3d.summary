by @entity0 the last king to sit on it was poisoned at his own wedding , so it was perhaps no surprise that the @entity5 preferred not to take the @entity6 when she visited the @entity7 set			1
instead , the monarch inspected the seat , which is made from interlaced iron swords , from a safe distance before getting a closer look at the royal treasury of @entity14 , laid out beside it			0
she was , however , happy to hold a tiny replica and beamed as she met cast members , among them @entity18 who plays @entity19 , @entity20 who plays queen @entity21 and @entity22 who plays @entity23			1
home to the wicked queen @entity21 , @entity6 was the scene of several machiavellian plots and scores of unpleasant murders , among them that of the ' @entity45 who was stabbed in the back by @entity48 's brother , @entity47			1
luckily for the @entity5 and @entity51 , the cast were on their best behaviour and chatted politely with the royal couple as they showed them around the set			1
@entity58 , the 17 - year - old star who plays the spirited @entity59 , was the first of the actors to chat to the monarch			0
' she kept commenting on how uncomfortable the throne looked , that was funny , ' she said			0
looks uncomfortable ! @entity64 refused to say whether the @entity5 and @entity51 watch @entity7 curious ? the @entity5 steps a little closer to the throne which according to @entity14 legend , is made from more than 1000 swords - is she tempted to take a seat ? one is amused ! the @entity5 seemed in good spirits during her tour of the set while the @entity51 was fascinated by the knives and swords ' i do n't think i 've ever been as nervous to meet anybody , ' added @entity20			1
' i did n't think i was , and then i saw her appear and i suddenly thought , " it 's the @entity5 , the real queen " ! she was really cool and gorgeous and delightful			1
' i think of everything she has done and everything she has achieved and the fact she is still interested even though she has met countless people and talked about numerous things			0
' equally excited was @entity18			2
' being here and meeting the @entity5 , it 's pretty amazing that the show has done that and she has come to see the sets			1
it gives it some sense of scale , ' he said			0
' she is an incredible person			0
she has an incredible presence about her			0
to meet someone who has been on the throne as long as she has and has seen the things she has , it 's quite an experience			0
' one has better jewels in the @entity99 ! the @entity5 looked less than impressed with the contents of the @entity14 royal treasury @entity29 to meet you : the @entity5 chats to @entity22 ( @entity23 ) and @entity58 ( @entity59 ) while the @entity51 speaks to @entity20 and @entity18 captivated : the @entity5 and prince @entity51 were both fascinated by the huge array of props - most of which took the form of swords and knives chatty couple : the @entity5 and prince @entity110 seem to have lots of questions for the @entity7 cast , among them @entity22 and @entity18 nervous ? @entity114 ( @entity115 ) , @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) and @entity58 ( @entity59 ) await the arrival of the @entity5 the @entity118 drama , which emerged from a set of fantasy novels by @entity121 , is thought to be loosely based on the @entity122 , which saw two opposing dynasties battle it out for the throne of @entity125			1
with @entity127 on one side and @entity126 on the other , @entity125 was convulsed by a series of battles , dastardly plots and pretenders lurking on the other side of the @entity135 until , with the death of @entity137 , @entity126 finally triumphed			2
@entity5 , who also holds the title and the lands of the @entity140 , had earlier been given a snapshot into the @entity143 's more recent bloody past , visiting the infamous @entity144 , accompanied by former inmate @entity145			2
@entity145 , who remains a controversial figure thanks to his links to the @entity148 , also met the @entity5 for a 10 - minute meeting at @entity150 , her official residence in @entity152 , last night			2
not as good as the @entity153 ! the @entity5 showed a healthy interest during her tour of the set and looked particularly interested in the trappings a fan in the making ? the queen seemed keen to learn more about the programme although @entity64 refused to say whether she watches the show more manageable ? the @entity5 holds a miniature @entity6 and seems slightly happier with its size compared to the original throne wicked queen : in the fantasy world of @entity14 , the evil queen @entity48 rules the roost - with the help of her brother , and erstwhile lover , @entity173 afterwards , he told the @entity174 that the meeting was about ' reaching out the hand of friendship to the @entity178 '			1
' i met @entity5 tonight in my role as deputy first minister , representing the entire community , ' he added			0
' @entity183 requires bold gestures and this is the third time i have met with @entity5 as part of that continuing process			0
' @entity64 declined to say whether the @entity5 and @entity51 are fans of the show			1
a spokeswoman said they were ' interested to see the impact the filming has had on the local economy and the local skills and crafts that make the show			0
' the @entity5 's visit to the @entity7 set was one of a series of engagements scheduled in and around @entity36 today			1
after a lunch at @entity204 with local dignitaries , the monarch visited the lovely @entity207 's covered market , where she chatted to stallholders and met well - wishers			0
she also became the latest victim of an unscheduled royal selfie , as an eager young fan tried to snap a photo with her on his @entity214 - much to the consternation of the @entity5 's security detail			2
afterwards , she was driven back to @entity150 , her @entity152 official residence , where she and the @entity51 joined guests for a party in the sunny garden			2
not impressed : the @entity5 's security detail look horrified as a local boy attempts to take a selfie with the @entity5 during her visit to @entity207 's market adorable : the @entity5 looks delighted after being presented with a cushion by a tiny well - wisher during her visit to the lovely @entity207 's covered market in @entity36 enjoying the day : @entity5 , who had changed into a pretty pale pink ensemble , beamed as she was introduced to guests at @entity150 prison : the @entity5 had earlier been given a snapshot into the @entity143 's more recent bloody past at the @entity144 with @entity145 and @entity233			1

the @entity5 toured the set of the *popular* @entity118 drama during a visit to @entity36 's @entity35
although the only real queen on the set , @entity5 refused to take the famous @entity6
@entity7 is loosely based on the @entity122 , which was eventually *won* by @entity126
the @entity5 herself is descended from @entity126 and is the current holder of both duchy and title
she was joined for the visit by stars @entity18 ( @entity19 ) and @entity22 ( @entity23 )
@entity20 , who plays queen @entity21 , *confessed* to being nervous before the meeting
@entity64 refused to say whether the @entity5 and @entity51 watch the @entity118 show
