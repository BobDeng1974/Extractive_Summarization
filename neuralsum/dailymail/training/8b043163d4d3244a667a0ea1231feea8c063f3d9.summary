@entity9 struck home a penalty just minutes after star forward @entity12 saw red for slapping an opponent			1
@entity14 had put the hosts in front after just three minutes , before @entity17 equalised			1
host commentator the @entity5 players are clapped off the pitch , and rightly so			1
incredible scenes at the end as @entity12 is sent off for the limp @entity23 before @entity9 saves the day			1
real extend their lead at the top , somehow			0
of course , @entity9 scores			1
who needs @entity12 ? boos ring out at the @entity29			1
the hosts have hung on so well but 10 - man @entity4 have got lucky			1
@entity9 's free - kick strikes a hand in the wall and the referee has no hesitation			1
@entity12 is sent off ! the star forward has had a poor day at the office and he is red carded after slapping ( and kicking the defender )			1
he was caught in a scuffle just before that as well			0
70mins : @entity42 ca n't bring off one his front three , can he ? left back for left back			0
68mins : so close for @entity5			1
@entity44 goes clear after a poor back pass , loops the ball over @entity47 but the ball bounces and hit the bar			2
63mins : not exactly an attacking sub , but @entity52 looks shattered			2
on comes @entity53 , who has been linked with a move to @entity55			0
can he kick @entity4 into life ? 55mins : close again from @entity5			1
@entity58 's shot fizzes just wide of the post			0
so flat here today , @entity4			2
@entity60 then tests @entity47 again with a low effort			2
he 's getting closer ... 53mins : @entity5 still not sitting back ! a free - kick is met and the header loops back across goal but @entity65 just gets his head to it ahead of @entity68			1
@entity4 ca n't get any worse , can they ? closer than we thought it would be , that 's for sure			2
it 's been more the half of @entity60 than @entity12 , the @entity5 man has been superb			1
still , @entity12 go in at half time level , which is probably more than they deserve			2
34mins : @entity17 again goes close at the back post , @entity12 there too			1
@entity4 really knocking on the door now			2
i would normally be saying a @entity4 goal has been coming			2
so cruel on the hosts as a @entity9 flick on is pocked home by @entity17 in what was @entity4 's first real chance of the game			1
24mins : first sight of goal for @entity12 , who i do n't remember touching the ball this half			2
his free - kick sails harmlessly over the bar though			0
he promptly looks to the heavens			0
18mins : @entity60 goes close again ! the former @entity100 winger makes space on the right edge of the box but his shot whistles past the post with @entity106			0
minutes later , his volley his straight at the @entity4 goalkeeper			1
15mins : closest @entity4 have come so far			2

@entity9 was nearby but was flagged for offside			0
13mins : very fast start here from the hosts			0
@entity60 again dances away down the right but his cross is way overhit and it 's a goalkick			0
you 'd think they will need more than one to get anything out of today 's game			0
8mins : forward they come again ! @entity60 breaks away but his cutback to @entity124 is deflected			0
looking for that second goal on the counter , here			0
what a start for the minnows ! @entity14 scores his sixth goal of the season , sending the ball into the top right corner			1
@entity5 go straight on the attack ... and they 've got a penalty ! a shot is hit hard towards the goal and it strikes @entity140 ' hand			1
not much he could have done there , bit harsh			0
but what a chance ! got a feeling of a cup game this one			0
small stadium , fans close to the pitch - the tunnel the players walked through looked a bit like a greenhouse , which is nice			0
yes - there was a familiar name in that @entity5 starting xi.			1
. it 's @entity60 ! the former @entity157 flop is on loan with the @entity7 side having failed to impress at @entity160			0
he 's played twice , and is yet to score			0
