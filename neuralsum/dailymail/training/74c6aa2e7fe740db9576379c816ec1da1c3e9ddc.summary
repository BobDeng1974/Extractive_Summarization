miss @entity10 had taken his phone from him one morning in june last year at their home			1

i do n't think he wanted to live the life he had any more but i do n't think he wanted to die			0
i think it was a cry for help ' @entity10 , mother of @entity8 assistant deputy coroner @entity79 asked her : ‘ in an incident which must happen probably hundreds and thousands of times every day throughout the country , a parent takes the mobile phone away for a short period or even if it 's only until such time as you 've cleaned and tidied your room or until you 've done your homework , how would @entity8 react to that ? ’ she replied : ‘ he probably would have been angry with his mum for taking it and perhaps sulked about it			1
’ describing how she heard the news of @entity8 's death , mrs @entity92 said : ‘ i did n't believe it at first when i heard			2
for one minute i do n't believe @entity8 wanted to take his life			2
‘ i actually think he wanted to inflict pain upon himself			0
that 's how i interpret it			0
he wanted to see how much pain he could stand and unfortunately it ended in his death			0
’ a post-mortem examination found @entity8 had died from hanging			1
the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death and said he could not be satisfied that @entity8 had intended to take his own life			2
treatment : the 12 - year - old schoolboy was pronounced dead at @entity14 last june ‘ i hear that he is a young man with attitude , not a bad thing , ’ mr @entity79 said			1
‘ in my own school reports i can remember people saying “ attitude retarding progress ” and it did n't seem to do me any harm			0
' he obviously wanted to inflict pain upon himself or indeed pain upon his mother ... " i 'll show you " sort of attitude ... " you 've taken my phone away " ' assistant deputy coroner @entity79 ‘ part of that was mum taking his phone away from him in order to tidy his room or do something he needed to do			2
' mr @entity79 said he did not think @entity8 understood that ' if you are dead today , you are dead tomorrow '			1
he added : ‘ they ( some children ) do n't realise , perhaps sometimes it 's not a question of re-booting the computer and they all come back to life			0
‘ he obviously wanted to inflict pain upon himself or indeed pain upon his mother ... " i 'll show you " sort of attitude ... " you 've taken my phone away ”			0
education : @entity8 had attended @entity13 in @entity9 and was described as a ' well respected ' pupil ‘ i think if one considers the nature of this young man and the nature of his personality , i think it is more than likely than not this was a cry for help or a cry of punishment to his mum or to scare people and so led to an unfortunate turn of events			1
’ ' he probably would have been angry with his mum for taking it and perhaps sulked about it ' @entity70 , family support worker mr @entity79 urged miss @entity10 to remember the good things in @entity8 's life and not the tragedy of his death			1
‘ all i would say to you @entity10 , as his mum , is that while @entity8 may have been a difficult lad during his 12 years , i am sure there were many moments during his life where he brought great joy , fun and everything else you do in your family , ’ he said			1
‘ what i would urge you and the rest of your family to do is when you wake up tomorrow morning and remember @entity8 , remember those occasions rather than the circumstances resulting in his death			2
‘ if you want to remember him , go back to that school report because there is a lot there you and your family can be mightily proud of			0
