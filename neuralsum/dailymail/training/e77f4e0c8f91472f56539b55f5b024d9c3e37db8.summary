a @entity1 congressman known as a pit bull in @entity3 said thursday that he does n't support the idea of impeachment proceedings against president @entity6 because winning that fight would elevate the vice president to the @entity9			1
' have you met @entity13 ? ' @entity11 rep. @entity10 asked during a @entity15 interview			1
impeachment talk has swirled around @entity3 since the president announced that an executive order overhauling @entity20 's immigration system is imminent			1
but some in the @entity1 see @entity13 as @entity6 's hedge against removal from office , since much of his public exposure has come in conjunction with a series of embarrassing gaffes			1
' ' only in this case , we 're pretty sure we know both devils			0
and @entity13 – he 's two floppy shoes short of a complete clown outfit			1
let 's be honest : he 's @entity6 's insurance policy			1
' impeachment is a process that begins in the @entity39 with a list of charges that must fit what the @entity20 @entity59 calls ' high crimes and misdemeanors ' – with ' high ' referring to the level of the president 's office , not the seriousness of the offenses			1
a supermajority of two - thirds of @entity20 senators are required to convict @entity20 's chief executive after a trial			2
president @entity73 survived an impeachment after @entity75 remained unanimous in acquitting him			2
@entity76 resigned his office as a groundswell of support formed in @entity80 for impeachment proceedings following the @entity82			0
@entity6 appears safe , even with republicans holding 54 or 55 of the upper chamber 's 100 seats next year			1
and besides , there 's the @entity13 factor			1
in a speech this year , this vice president told a gathering of @entity92 leaders that @entity92 was a country , not a continent			0
it brought back memories of a 2008 photo - op outside @entity13 's home where he told journalists that he had just returned from ' a successful dump , ' which turned out to be a trip to a nearby landfill			1
in 2010 he had a diplomatic face - palm moment by consoling @entity104 prime minister @entity103 on the loss of his mother – who was very much alive			2
in 2012 he made the sign of the cross while on stage to address a group of more than 1,600 @entity113 rabbis			0
reporters guffawed later that year when he tried to capture the spirit of president @entity117 's famous ' speak softly ' philosophy , by noting that ' the president has a big stick			2
' during a campaign speech during his first vice presidential run , he criticized then - @entity1 candidate sen. @entity125 for what he called a ' last - minute economic plan ' that did ' nothing to tackle the number - one job facing the middle class			1
' ' it happens to be , as @entity6 says , a three - letter word : jobs			2
' @entity10 , a former criminal prosecutor , chairs the special @entity135 looking into the 2012 terror attacks in @entity137 , @entity138			0
he is also chairman of the @entity139 on @entity140 and @entity141 he hinted thursday on @entity15 that because @entity13 would be a global laughingstock , the idea of trying to kick @entity6 out of office is far out on @entity146 's fringes			1
' nobody 's discussing impeachment except pundits and commentators , ' he said			0
' first of all , impeachment is a punishment			0
it 's not a remedy			0
second of all , the only people who want us to talk about impeachment are the president 's allies			2
' @entity15 host @entity160 had asked whether @entity6 's threatened immigration executive order would be reason enough for the @entity1 to try to remove him from office @entity13 , seen friday at the @entity165 in @entity3 , has made no secret of his leaning toward a 2016 presidential run @entity15 host @entity160 had challenged him , citing an analysis by former new jersey superior court judge @entity169 , who is now a @entity15 analyst			1
an @entity6 - initiated move to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants , @entity160 said , paraphrasing @entity169 , ' is an impeachable situation because it does go against @entity80 making the laws , because the president is making a new law			1
' ' and the new law says that if you have children who are @entity20 citizens even though you yourself are an illegal undocumented person , you can stay in this country			0
that supersedes the old law			0
@entity169 claims it ’s unconstitutional and impeachable			0
' with that bait dangling , a few @entity1 have broached the subject , including @entity188 rep. @entity187			1
' impeachment is indicting in the @entity39 and that ’s a possibility , ' @entity187 said monday on @entity191			2
' but you still have to convict in the @entity75 and that takes a two - thirds vote			0
' but impeachment would be a consideration			0
' @entity10 , however , said he can resist the same bait			2
' i 'm not going to take it because i 've met @entity13 , ' he explained			0
' that 's not the answer			0
... he could be the new president ! '			0

@entity10 said his party ca n't impeach the president over his threatened immigration overhaul – but only because @entity13 would become president
the folksy @entity13 wants the top job for himself but @entity1 see him as a *potentially* embarrassing one - man gaffe factory
one senior @entity39 @entity1 aide said @entity13 is ' two floppy shoes short of a complete clown outfit ' and @entity6 's ' insurance policy '
@entity10 hinted that impeachment is being dangled by the @entity218 as bait in the hope that the @entity1 will *destroy* its own *credibility* by trying it
a @entity188 @entity1 congressman and a judge - turned - news - analyst floated the idea this week
