by @entity0 from pork scratchings to haggis , brussels sprouts and marmite , most of us are fans of at least one food that others would n't touch			0
but while marmite might seem a bizarre choice to some , the yeasty spread pales in comparison to the favourite snack of @entity16 , from @entity17 in @entity18			1
instead of putting make - up on her face , the 22 - year - old prefers to eat it , munching her way through between 15 and 20 compacts a day			1
tasty : make - up fan @entity16 savours some of her favourite metallic brown and grey eyeshadow what 's more , she says , the taste varies by brand and colour , with metallic eyeshadow in light brown , white and grey apparently boasting the nicest flavour			1
' i can not live without eating make - up , ' she explains			1
' you can imagine it just coating your insides with whatever colour you 're eating			0
it 's just like craving your favourite candy bar			2
' @entity16 's unusual habit began when she was just five years old and , intrigued by the colours in her mother 's make - up case , decided to taste it			1
' seeing all the colours made me want to taste it , ' she remembers			0
' once i tasted it , i just could not stop eating make - up			1
' my favourite type of eyeshadow to eat is usually the metallic colours , ' she continues			2
' my favourite colours are grey , white and the light colour browns			0
light colours usually taste a lot cleaner than darker colours			0
' tucking in : @entity16 has eaten make - up since tasting a compact belonging to her mother at the age of five dangerous : @entity16 's unusual snack contains some unpleasant ingredients such as talc , mica and mineral oil tasty treat : this @entity71 with several metallic shades would be a treat for @entity16 despite having had a penchant for tucking into eyeshadow since the age of five , @entity16 admits that she goes to extreme lengths to keep her snacking habits secret from her family			1
' i hide make - up everywhere around my house , ' she explains			1
' under the couches , in the flower vases , the freezer ... my hair is long so i like to use it to conceal the make - up i would like to bring			2
' i keep my addiction to make - up hidden because i 'd rather not go through the hassle of explaining it to people			2
' my mother does n't know but if she knew , i 'd never hear the end of it and it would go on for hours and hours every day			0
' thanks to her penchant for eating make - up , @entity16 now spends upwards of $ 200 ( £ 120 ) a week on cosmetics and has developed an unusual supermarket shopping routine			1
' when i come into the store , i have to taste to make sure i bought the right ones , ' she reveals			0
' i would just pour some on my hand , look around to make sure no - one 's walking down the aisle and i would just lick it			2
' if it 's not the right kind and since nobody sees me lick it , i 'll put it back			0
i know that 's kind of wrong but i do n't want to get stuck with something i do n't eat or wear			0
' but while @entity16 appears to think that her penchant for eating make - up is harmless , a swift glance at some common ingredients is enough to suggest that it 's likely to be doing her body no good at all			1
among ingredients typically found in @entity16 's favourite eyeshadow is @entity121 , or as it 's properly known , hydrous magnesium silicate which is similar to asbestos			1
choices : brittoni stocks up on make - up at the local supermarket - she spends up to £ 120 a week sneaky : @entity16 takes a sneaky slurp from a compact while shopping for make - up in a supermarket other substances found in make - up include mineral oil , a petrol derivative , and mica , a mineral that is used to colour paint			1
diagnosed with heart trouble at the age of 12 , possibly because of her unusual habit , @entity16 says she tries not to think about potential adverse effects			0
' i try not to think about the impact the make - up is having on my heart , ' she explains			2
' i see the chemicals in the make - up and i do n't know what they are			2
' it really scares me : are they making my heart worse ? are they not affecting me at all ? i do n't know			0
' and its not just her health that has been affected			0
@entity16 's relationship with boyfriend @entity156 has also been put under strain by her passion for paint			2
' one day i saw her doing it and she tasted it , then i just saw her eat a whole scoop of the thing and i could n't believe it , ' he explains			0
' when she eats make - up , it looks like a clown went crazy			1
you know how you have a milk mustache ? it looks like that to the tenth power - that 's how her face looks			0
i 've kissed her before and i 've tasted make - up - it 's horrible			1
