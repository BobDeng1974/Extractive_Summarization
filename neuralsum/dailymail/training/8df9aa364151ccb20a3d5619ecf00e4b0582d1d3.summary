@entity11 in @entity12 by @entity13 last updated at 2:30 pm on 27th january 2012 somali pirates have threatened to kill an @entity2 hostage after a daring night - time @entity17 mission to rescue two foreign aid workers			1
the pirates have moved the hostage at least three times in 24 hours in reaction to the rescue of the @entity2 woman and @entity24 man			1
their response has now raised questions about whether other @entity28 captives are now in greater danger			0
danger : the pirates have moved the @entity2 hostage at least three times in 24 hours after @entity17 parachuted into @entity8 to rescue a @entity2 woman and @entity24 man earlier in the week ( graphic ) mission : two teams of @entity17 rescued the hostages after a gun battle with the pirates in the middle of the night ( file picture ) ' if they try again , we will all die together , ' warned @entity43 , a @entity8 pirate connected to the gang holding the @entity2 , who was kidnapped on saturday in northern @entity8			1
' it 's difficult to hold @entity2 hostages , because it 's a game of chance : die or get huge money			1
but we shall stick with our plans and will never release him until we get a ransom , ' @entity43 said			0
overnight on wednesday , @entity17 parachuted into @entity8 and hiked to the base where the pirates were holding 32 - year - old @entity2 @entity54 and @entity55 , a 60 - year - old @entity24			1
a gun battle ensued and nine of the pirates were killed			0
the hostages were freed unharmed			0
no casualties have been reported among the @entity2 forces			2
in response the gang holding the @entity2 kidnapped in the northern town of @entity63 have moved him three times , @entity43 said			1
' holding hostages in one place is unlikely now because we are the next target , ' he told @entity70 by telephone			2
he also expressed concern that the @entity2 has pirate informants			2
' it was n't just a hit - and - run operation , but long planned with the help of insiders among us , ' @entity43 said , noting that the @entity2 struck at a time when the pirates were least on their guard			2
@entity83 spokesman @entity82 said officials have been in contact with the family of the latest @entity2 kidnapping victim			0
night - time rescue : the pirates kidnapped 32 - year - old @entity2 @entity54 and @entity55 , a 60 - year - old @entity24 in october held captive : ms @entity54 , left , of @entity90 , and mr @entity91 , right , are seen speaking in a hostage video ' we are also working with our contacts in @entity95 and in @entity8 to try to get more information , ' @entity82 told reporters in @entity98			1
' obviously we condemn kidnapping of any kind and call for the immediate release of the victims - any victims			0
we also would note that our travel warning for @entity8 does caution @entity2 citizens about the risk of travel			2
' after their rescue , miss @entity54 and mr @entity91 were flown to the @entity111 at @entity112 on the @entity114 island of @entity12 to undergo medical screenings and other evaluations before heading home , a @entity2 defense official said			1
miss @entity54 's family was meeting her at the base , which is the hub of @entity17 air operations in the @entity122			0
the pair had been working for the @entity124 , part of the @entity126 , when they were abducted by gunmen near the north - central town of @entity130 in october			0
@entity24 foreign minister @entity131 said miss @entity54 's poor health had led the @entity2 to take action and the operation did not necessarily pave the way for further missions an ailing @entity137 kidnapped by @entity8 gunmen died in captivity last year after not having access to her medication			1
message : @entity143 , who authorised the rescue mission , called miss @entity54 's father @entity145 to say : ' all @entity2 have @entity54 in our thoughts and prayers , and give thanks that she will soon be reunited with her family ' there is mixed opinion on the effect the @entity2 raid will have on the situation with other captives , with one pirate warning that other @entity2 hostages might suffer as a result			1
however a @entity28 official in @entity95 said that the killings of the nine captors might make pirates think twice about taking more captives			0
he spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media			0
on wednesday evening , hours after the @entity2 military raid , the gang holding the @entity2 hostage started circulating false rumours that they had executed him			1
another security official who has years of experience in the region said it was likely the men holding the @entity2 would move him onto a ship with other foreign hostages , because ships were easier to defend and planning rescue operations is more complicated when hostages from other countries are involved			1
at least one pirate agreed with his analysis			0
' i think land captivity is going to end now			0
sea is much safer , ' pirate @entity187 said by phone from the coastal town of @entity191			0
' even ships are not very safe , but you can at least hit back and resist			0
' other hostages held in @entity8 include a @entity196 tourist and two @entity198 aid workers seized in neighboring @entity95 , a @entity137 military adviser and 155 sailors of various nationalities hijacked at sea .			2
