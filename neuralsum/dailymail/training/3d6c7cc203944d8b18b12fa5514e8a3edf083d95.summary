by @entity1 reporter published : 03:03 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 3 june 2013 former @entity3 presenter @entity2 admitted he would ' probably ' watch child pornography after provoking outrage last month by appearing to suggest women could ' aggravate ' their risk of being raped former @entity3 presenter @entity2 has admitted he would ' probably ' watch child pornography to ' see what all the fuss is about '			1
mr @entity2 , 65 , provoked outrage last month among campaigners against rape and on social networking sites by appearing to suggest women could ' aggravate ' their risk of being raped			1
he has now admitted his views were likely to get him into ' hot water ' again after making comments about child pornography , as well as suggesting some cultures were more likely to commit certain crimes			1
speaking at @entity19 yesterday , he said : ' i had never seen , until i started working on @entity3 , child pornography			1
' i think if someone came to me and said : " would you like to see what all the fuss is about ? " , i ’m sorry , i probably would say yes			0
' he also referred to a study which suggested internet users clicked on links to extreme pornography even if that had not been what they had searched for			2
he said he did not believe this meant ' we 're all awful '			0
he also courted further controversy when he said certain crimes were more likely to be committed by some cultures more than others			2
he claimed there was no evidence of institutional racism in the police force but said some @entity44 communities were more likely to mug people			0
today , mr @entity2 hit back at the reports , saying : ' once again , i am being made to sound as though i am making outrageous comments			1
' in a statement to @entity50 , he said of his comments on child pornography : ' this was in the context of an academic experiment that showed , against expectations , most people do look at pornography if they stumble across it , even if they were not seeking it			1
' my book quotes many examples of how we believe we are personally immune from things for which we blame others , but that temptation and opportunity are dangers for us all			2
' for the record , i have been shown photos of child pornography by police in the @entity3 office , so i can not say i have never seen such images			1
' i have never looked at child pornography in any other context and nor would i wish to			1
mr @entity2 also referred to a study which suggested internet users clicked on links to extreme pornography even if they had not searched for it ' any report that i said , or think , that it is acceptable to view child pornography is entirely false and defamatory			1
' all such images are crimes against children and any circulation of them perpetuates a dangerous problem			2
' i have devoted much of my career professionally and privately trying to protect people of all ages from crime , and it is highly offensive that anyone might be led to believe i would do anything to endanger children , let alone in indulge in child pornography			1
' referring to his views on crime , he added : ' today , as a result of a talk at the @entity19 yesterday , the impression has been given that i have said different races are likely to commit different crimes			1
' this is wholly untrue			0
i said that different cultures tend to favour different crimes			2
any connection with skin colour is entirely incidental			0
' ' i think if someone came to me and said : " would you like to see what all the fuss is about ? " , i ’m sorry , i probably would say yes ' - @entity2 mr @entity2 , who presented @entity3 from 1984 to 2007 , caused a storm of protest last month over comments about rape in his new book			1
he likened women who dressed and behaved provocatively to banks storing cash by the front door , or motorists leaving laptops on the back seat of their cars			2
he insisted he was not blaming victims – saying ‘ no amount of temptation can excuse rape ’ – but questioned whether some women chose not to pursue complaints because they felt partly responsible			0
in an extract from his new book , published in the @entity130 , he said : ‘ rape victims were once treated appallingly , as though it was all their fault , but have we now gone too far the other way ? ‘ many of the victims seem to think we have			2
the main argument of my book is this : we can aggravate crime by tempting fate , and we curb it by playing safe			0
‘ we have come to acknowledge it is foolish to leave laptops on the back seat of a car			0
we would laugh at a bank that stored sacks of cash by the front door			0
we would be aghast if an airport badly skimped on its security measures			0
‘ our forebears might be astonished at how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been regarded as incitement			0
mr @entity2 is famous for presenting @entity3 with the late presenter @entity155 ‘ not even in the licentious days of @entity156 in the 17th @entity157 was it acceptable for women to dress as provocatively as they have done in @entity160 culture since the 1960s			1
equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted , stay out late , often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss , grope or go to bed with one - night stands			0
’ mr @entity2 said the @entity130 had misquoted him in its headline , which said ‘ not all women are victims and not all rape is rape ’ , but said the edited extract was fair			2
mr @entity2 said the book was ‘ serious , carefully researched and evidence - based ’ and an attempt to have a reasoned debate about a sensitive subject			1
he told the @entity1 : ‘ of course i do not compare a woman to a laptop			0
that is nothing short of misrepresentation of my message			0
‘ what i am saying is that opportunity and temptation are key factors in all crimes , and so far as the evidence goes sex crimes are no exception			0
‘ far from blaming people my book says we are too quick to blame , and that it tends to distract us from finding solutions to crime			0
’ speaking yesterday mr @entity2 urged critics to read his book ' @entity193 and how to solve it , and @entity194 of what we ’re told is wrong ' .			1

@entity2 admits he would ' probably ' watch child pornography
he also suggested some cultures were more likely to commit certain crimes
@entity2 was forced to defend himself after a *backlash* against his new book
presenter hit back today saying : ' i am being made to sound as though i am making outrageous comments '
