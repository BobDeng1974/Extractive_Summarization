by @entity0 for the @entity1 stroke patients admitted to hospital at the weekend could have a higher risk of dying on badly staffed wards , new research suggests			1
a study of 56,000 patients found a huge disparity in the number of nurses working on stroke units at weekends			1
the worst staffed wards saw an extra death for every 25 patients within a month of admission , the data shows			1
the research , carried out by specialists from the @entity20 and five @entity22 universities , found a five-fold difference in weekend staffing between the best and worst hospitals			1
stroke patients admitted to hospital at the weekend could have a higher risk of dying wards with fewer nurses , new research suggests while the best stroke units had five nurses for every ten patients , the worst - staffed had just one nurse monitoring ten people			1
the study , which used data from 103 @entity39 stroke units over 18 months , found that death rates are directly related to the number of nurses on the ward			1
remarkably , the researchers found specialist doctors did not have the same impact on mortality			0
there was no significant difference in death rates in units where consultants did weekend rounds and those where they did not , according to the data , which was collected in 2011 and 2012			1
but the study suggests that nurses - who are more likely to spot problems with eating or breathing - are vital to life expectancy			2
taking the average figures for all 103 hospitals , the researchers found only a ‘ borderline ’ difference between the death rates for patients admitted on weekends and those admitted on weekdays			1
but they said that picture ‘ masked ’ a huge variation between different stroke units - with poorly - staffed wards seeing rising mortality for weekend patients			1
the paper , published last night in the journal @entity75 , reports that patients admitted at weekends to a well - staffed ward , with three nurses for every ten patients , had an 11.2 per cent chance of dying within a month			1
that death rate rose to 15.2 per cent on stroke wards with 1.5 nurses for ten patients , meaning an extra death for every 25 patients			1
the authors wrote : ‘ patients admitted on a weekend to a stroke unit with below - average nurse / bed ratios had a higher risk of death than those admitted on a weekday			2
‘ by contrast , weekend admission to a stroke unit with above - average nurse / bed ratios was not associated with an excess of mortality task compared to patients admitted during a weekday			2
’ the @entity100 recently issued new guidelines advising hospitals to provide a nurse for every eight patients on general wards , but there is no guidance on how many nurses should work on specialist wards covering specific problems such as strokes			2
the survey of 56,000 stroke patients in the @entity22 found the worst staffed wards saw an extra death for every 25 patients within a month of admission study author dr @entity115 , of the @entity20 , said : ‘ we found a strong relationship between the number of nurses working on a weekend and the risk of a patient dying after a stroke			1
‘ it is up to individual hospitals to review their staffing levels and for policy makers to look at this sort of evidence and point to what they think would be minimum levels of nurses			0
’ dr @entity133 , chief executive of the @entity134 , said the disparity was unacceptable			0
a @entity137 spokesman said : ‘ @entity139 stroke units are open seven days a week and provide excellent care			2
‘ getting staffing levels right is a key priority for hospitals , but we understand it ca n’t be achieved overnight			0
' progress has been made and the addition of 6,300 more nurses on hospital wards since 2010 is making a big difference			0
’ ‘ this is further evidence of the vital importance of having proper nurse staffing levels to ensure good patient care , ’ he said			0
‘ if a hospital has enough nurses in place , stroke patients are more likely to survive and to recover			2
‘ it is unacceptable that stroke patient mortality rates are higher at weekends when staffing levels tend to be lower			0
‘ driving up standards of patient care in the @entity100 requires commitment to investing in the nursing workforce			0
' we ’re worried that this is n’t happening and that there remains much more work to do in providing safe staffing levels for every health setting			0
’ @entity174 , deputy director of external affairs at the @entity176 , added : ‘ nurses are a vital part of the specialist stroke team , helping more people survive and thrive after stroke			0
' stroke is a medical emergency , so stroke survivors should have access to the best levels of specialist diagnosis and treatment seven days a week			0
‘ @entity190 staffing levels of specialist stroke nurses play a key role in ensuring that no one dies needlessly of stroke			0

study of 56,000 stroke patients found huge disparity in number of nurses working on stroke units at weekends across @entity22 hospitals
worst - staffed wards saw extra death for every 25 patients within a month of admission , data reveals
*scientists* at five @entity22 universities found five-fold difference in weekend staffing between best and worst hospitals
