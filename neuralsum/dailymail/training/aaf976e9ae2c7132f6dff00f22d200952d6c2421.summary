letting your husband teach you how to drive might sound like a recipe for marital disaster but that has n't stopped three intrepid women from doing exactly that			1
yet despite the potential for pit falls , @entity9 , 33 , from @entity10 , says far from being a disaster , having partner @entity12 , 31 , with her in the car proved something of a blessing			1
' when i was younger , i was in a road traffic accident and my boyfriend at the time was killed , ' explains the mother - of - three			0
' it made me terrified of being on the road			0
all that changed , however , when she met @entity33 , a teacher and now the father of their three children , @entity38 , nine , @entity39 , four , and @entity40 , one			1
' being with @entity12 has cleared the way for me to do things for myself , ' adds his adoring partner , ' and he and the children gave me the confidence to start driving again			2
' not , however , that driving lessons with @entity12 went entirely to plan			0
filmed for @entity51 documentary , never teach your wife to drive , ms @entity9 's inability to concentrate on the road is enough to leave @entity12 tearing his hair out			1
a lack of spatial awareness and a fondness for the accelerator do n't help either , with @entity12 at one point leaning over to grab the wheel , only for ms @entity9 to screech : ' you 're not allowed to grab my flipping wheel ! that must be illegal , @entity12 ! ' @entity65 : @entity9 and @entity12 scream in terror as she plunges across a junction towards a petrol station stop ! a clearly rattled @entity12 ca n't resist grabbing the wheel - much to his other half 's displeasure but while it might sound , quite literally , like a recipe for car crash tv , ms @entity9 insists that the overall experience has been a positive one , even if she was n't too keen on her other half 's ' blunt and to - the - point ' teaching style			1
' we have a very strong relationship , we laugh everyday and always make up if we have a tiff , ' she explains			0
' if your relationship is strong it should n't cause a problem and i enjoyed every minute			0
we still laugh about the experience now			0
' poor @entity12 is also nursing some bruises after ms @entity9 accidentally hit him with the car and , unsurprisingly , asked her to get a real driving instructor for attempt number two			1
one lesson she is still to learn is one that @entity12 spends much of the series trying to pass on - concentrate on the road			2
' @entity12 teaching me to drive only really affected our relationship while we were in the car , ' she explains			0
happy ending : despite the thrills and spills , @entity9 said she would do it all over again given the chance ' @entity12 was always telling me to take it seriously and concentrate but that was something i found really difficult because i 'm a fun - loving person and rarely take anything seriously			1
' and , in one heart - stopping moment , it almost had fatal results			2
' i put my foot on the wrong pedal and shot across the junction into a petrol station , ' she admits			1
another scary moment saw her take out a row of recycling bins - much to the horror of both @entity12 and the driving examiner in the back			2
but , hopes ms @entity9 , the day when she finally makes it onto the road as a fully - fledged driver is n't far off and since the end of filming , has passed her theory test			1
still having lessons , albeit not with @entity12 , she says her driving has improved immeasurably although , she jokes , she still rings her friends and family to warn them when she 's on the road			0
after a litany of near misses , tension - laden drives and driving induced flare - ups , would she recommend other women employ their husbands as driving instructors ? ' i 'd definitely do it all again , ' she chuckles			0
' from me , it 's a big , fat yes ! '			0
