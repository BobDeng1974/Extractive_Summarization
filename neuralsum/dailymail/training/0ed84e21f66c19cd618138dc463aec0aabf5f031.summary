by @entity0 for @entity1 you might want to keep your fear of flying in check next time you 're at an airport			0
a new camera being developing in @entity8 aims to highlight highly - anxious people in the hopes of catching suicide bombers			2
the device uses a stress sensor that measures the amount of oxygen in blood in various parts of the body , such as the face , to pick out suspects in a crowd			1
the device was inspired by recent deadly attacks in public places in @entity8			2
for instance , in march eight knife - wielding criminals in the city of @entity28 , @entity25 left 29 civilians dead and over 140 others injured ( pictured ) the device is currently under development at @entity8 's @entity34 in @entity35 and was inspired by recent deadly attacks in the country			1
in march , eight knife - wielding criminals in the city of @entity28 , @entity25 left 29 civilians dead and over 140 others injured ' they all looked and behaved as ordinary people but their level of mental stress must have been extremely high before they launched their attacks , ' @entity38 , an associate professor of electronic information engineering at @entity34 told @entity45 at @entity46			2
the device uses a stress sensor that measures the amount of oxygen in blood in various parts of the body , such as the face , to pick out suspects in a crowd ' the higher the mental stress , the higher the blood oxygenation			1
our technology can detect such people , so law enforcement officers can take precautions and prevent these tragedies			0
' when the body is stress it releases hormones such as epinephrine and cortisol which increase strength and concentration			0
heart speeds up , sending more blood and oxygen to your muscles so you can take the body can take ' fight or flight ' action as soon as possible			0
chronic stress , or a constant stress experienced over a prolonged period of time , can contribute to long - term health problems for the heart and blood vessels			0
other indicators of stress , such as changes in heart rate and facial expression , can be controlled with practice , which is why the researchers chose to focus on the level of blood oxygenation			0
the camera uses something known as hyperspectral imaging which examines information across the electromagnetic spectrum and can pick out oxygen levels			0
the more stressed you are , the more oxygen is in your body			0
professor @entity38 explained that the mini-cameras would place a ' stress bar ' above a person 's head to help police officers monitor suspicious behaviour			1
he added that device would be able to tell the difference between high - oxygen levels in the blood caused by moderate exercise , such as running , and oxygen levels caused by stress			2
the technology is still at development stage and requires improvements in computing power to fit into a handheld device			1
even if the technical problems are overcome , professor @entity45 says that the device will not be launched for commercial use until laws exist in @entity8 to govern its use			1
cameras would place a ' stress bar ' above a person 's head to help police monitor suspicious behaviour			1

camera works by measuring the amount of oxygen in a person 's blood
it places a ' stress bar ' above person 's head if they are acting anxious
technology still under development and needs better computing power
@entity8 's @entity34 in @entity35 says the device will not be launched for commercial use until laws exist in @entity8 to govern its use
