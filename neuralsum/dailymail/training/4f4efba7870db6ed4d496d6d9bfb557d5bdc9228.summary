@entity9 who came to fame for her role on @entity12 has penned a book about her marriage and one portion that her husband @entity16 contributed is causing outrage			1
' men , i know you think your woman is n't the type who wants to be taken			0

' outrage : @entity9 's new book talks at length about her sex life with her husband and she says that wives should do everything to please their husband and avoid fights the couple 's sex life is discussed at length in the book by both of the @entity48 , and @entity9 advocates both ' real passionate sex and maintenance sex '			1
' maintenance sex keeps the wheels greased , the lines of communication open , and the fights to a minimum , ' she wrote , according to @entity57			1
her frequent mentions of fights that are avoided using sex has raised some eyebrows about their tempestuous relationship			1
' in the beginning , @entity16 wanted to have sex every single day , at least once , if not twice or three times … if i did n't give it to him once a day , he 'd get upset , ' she wrote			1
weighing in : @entity67 says that even if the woman says no , men should dominate them and force them to have sex family values : @entity9 ( left ) is @entity74 's ( right ) sister - in - law ' i can do something that pisses him off on a monday , but if we had sex on sunday night , it blows over more easily			1
but if we have n't done it for two days and i give him attitude ? it could be a huge fight			0
' @entity67 is the brother of @entity74 , who is another one of the stars on the @entity86 - based reality show			1
in spite of her tips about how she has to be home when her husband gets home and how she dresses to impress him , @entity9 maintains that the book - like their marriage - is all about ' mutual respect '			1
' i think it 's controversial in many ways because we do really live an old school type of marriage but with a modern twist , ' she said in a recent interview with @entity103			1
the @entity104 have three children - two boys and a girl - and @entity9 has said that she will be happy to give the book to her daughter when she gets married someday so that she knows how to approach her own marriage			1
though her marriage is said to be ' hot and happy ' , her continual fights with @entity74 remain a regular storyline on the reality show			1

love : @entity16 has been at @entity9 's side during a number of book appearances there 's real passionate sex and maintenance sex			1
you need them both for a healthy marriage			2
maintenance sex keeps the wheels greased , the lines of communication open , and the fights to a @entity143 way i see it , if a wife is a puttana , her husband will never feel the urge to go outside the marriage to actual whores , or strip clubs			1
he wo n't hit on women in bars , or drool over his friend 's girlfriends or the secretary			1
he 'll rush home to his wife , who makes sure he 'll have a good time ( the best time ) in the comfort of his own @entity159 in our early years , we 'd go to the bar , and i 'd make the rounds and talk to everyone			0
when we got home , @entity16 would say , " i feel like we did n't hang out			1
like you talked to everyone else more			0
" now , you might think , " why is he so needy ? " he 's not			2
@entity16 does n't need me to hold his hand at a party			2
it 's about respect and loyalty … we arrive together			2
we stay near each other			0
@entity67 's quotes from the book : men , i know you think your woman is n't the type who wants to be taken			2

to be on the same level , everyone has to get off the high horse			0
i do n't care if the woman makes more money than the man , if he 's a janitor and she 's the president			0
after a fourteen - hour workday , if a man comes home and there 's no dinner on the table , and his wife is on the phone , watching tv , or on the computer ignoring him , he wo n't feel respected .			0
