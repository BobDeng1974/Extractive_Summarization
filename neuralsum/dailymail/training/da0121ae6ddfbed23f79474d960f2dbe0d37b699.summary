the search engine would n't be responsible for selling or shipping items directly from its @entity19 ( pictured )			1
instead , it will work with manufacturers to simply offer a faster payment option at the moment , @entity0 's search results and shopping tab find items for sale and then send the customer to that merchant 's website to complete the purchase			1
under the rumoured plans , if a customer wants to buy an item without looking at it on the merchant 's site first , they can pay for it in one click of the buy button			0
the exact details of the scheme have not been announced , and reports claim the plans are still in the very early stages			0
on @entity10 , when a customer places their first order and enters a payment method and delivery address , 1 - click ordering is automatically enabled			1
earlier this year , @entity51 introduced a ‘ @entity7 ’ button that lets users make purchases directly through tweets			1
the button , which is currently only available to a small percentage of @entity59 users , appears at the bottom right of partner tweets in the @entity51 apps on @entity63 and @entity64			2
to make a purchase , users tap the button , review product details and enter their shipping and payment information when prompted			0
once complete , @entity51 sends an order confirmation			0
‘ an an entire purchase can be completed in just a few taps , ’ the company boasted in a blog post introducing the feature			0
to take advantage of the faster payment option , customers click ' buy now with 1 - click ' on any product page			1
the order is then charged to the default payment method on the account and delivered to the default address			0
it is thought @entity0 's system would work in a similar way and either charge to a card linked to a @entity0 account through @entity90 , or via a secure payment partnership with the website			2
