an inquisitive six foot tall polar bear got a bit too close to a photographer for comfort as it posed for the camera			2
@entity5 came within inches of the predator as she took pictures of it in the wild and was only separated by a chain fence			1
she said at first the animal was curious and came up to investigate what she was doing but rangers had to scare it away when it became too feisty			2
the curious polar bear dwarfs photographer @entity5 as they watch each other through a chain fence the enormous polar bear bites the fence and shows off its full height as it is photographed in @entity23 , @entity24 the polar bear and a ranger stand inches apart on either side of a chain fence ms @entity5 said rangers became concerned when the polar bear seemed to want to ' play - fight ' with her through the fence			1
she said : ' at first when the bear is lying down on the ground he seems like a big , cute dog			0
' but when he suddenly stands up on his hind legs easily reaching two meters high , you really get the idea of how strong and powerful this animal is			0
' this bear was trying to play - fight with us by pouncing on his front paws and the second the guides saw its behaviour they threw a stone at the bear 's feet to scare him off and it did the job			0
ms @entity5 said when the polar bear was lying on the ground he looked like a ' big , cute dog ' the inquisitive bear puts his paw on the fence during the ' photo shoot ' at the park in @entity24 @entity63 became concerned when the polar bear got feisty and appeared to want to ' play - fight ' through the fence ' if that did n't work they would use pepper spray			1
they also have a gun just in case and the loud sound would definitely scare the bear away			0
' the photographs were captured at @entity75 in @entity23 , @entity24 , in the heart of the bear 's territory			1
it is one of the few places people can get this close to the predators			0
ms @entity5 , from @entity84 , said : ' the bears come up to the fence of the lodge and it is an amazing experience facing such a marvellous and deadly animal			2
@entity90 , in @entity24 , is one of the few places people can get close to the magnificent animals two juvenile polar bears size each other up during a play - fight in the snow photographer @entity97 travelled from @entity84 for a chance to capture wild polar bears on camera ' they are very clever animals who are used to everyone running away from them , so when a human stands and wo n't move they become curious			1
' many the younger bears gather in @entity90 to practice fight other young bears			1
this helps them weigh up competition for serious battles later on in their lives .			0
