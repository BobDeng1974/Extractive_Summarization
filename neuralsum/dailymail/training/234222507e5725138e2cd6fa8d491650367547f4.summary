by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 08:29 est , 8 october 2012 there was mayhem in @entity3 on sunday as 25 cars were caught up in a huge crash on the final lap of @entity8 ’s @entity7 500			1
with the drivers racing at speeds of up to 200mph and in such a tight space on the circuit , the crash seemed an inevitability			2
but the racers managed to avoid serious disaster until the fourth turn of the 188th lap – the final one of the day - when 25 cars were caught up in the crash , caused by @entity20			1
over he goes : @entity20 ( no 14 ) battles to keep control of his car , but can do nothing to prevent it overturning a clean set of wheels : @entity20 had been leading the race before @entity29 clipped his rear bumper back down to earth : as @entity20 's car slid on its side , a 25 - car pile - up was created @entity20 , who was leading the race , tried to avoid the takeover attempt by @entity37			1
but the pursuing driver clipped @entity20 ’s bumper , sending him ploughing into several other cars			1
@entity20 ’s car then flipped over as 24 other cars were dragged into the collision			1
the no 14 car slid towards the barriers surrounding the track , taking out the other cars in the process as screeching tyres and clouds of smoke filled the arena			2
it was all part of the spectacle for the baying @entity8 fans , as many roared and cheered as the cars slid and careered into one another			2
@entity57 , who was higher up on the track at the time of the crash , was able to avoid the carnage and slipped by unscathed to win the race ahead of @entity63 and @entity64			1
@entity63 and @entity64 were nose - to - tail behind @entity20 when the crash happened , but were somehow able to round the carnage to finish the race			1
races at the @entity3 and @entity70 are run with restrictor plates which limit the speed of the cars , but that was n’t enough to prevent the ‘ big wreck ’ on sunday			0
luckily , no one was seriously injured in the crash after the cars ground to a halt and the flames were extinguished			2
carnage : the racers collided amid screeching tyres and clouds of smoke before the mayhem : the cars move at great speed in close proximity to one another not for the first time : @entity91 ( no 1 ) spun off the track before the massive wreck in the final lap @entity20 , who had tried to block out his opponents in the final lap to seal the victory , took full responsibility for the crash and said : ' i just screwed up			1
' driver @entity100 was shocked after the huge pile - up , and believes that the close proximity of the cars was a contributing factor			0
he said : ' it ’s not safe			0
if that ’s what people want , that ’s ridiculous			0
' ' if this is what we did every week , i would n't be doing it , ' @entity100 said			0
' i 'd find another job			0
... you ca n't get away from each other			0
how many cars were in that wreck ? and that 's ok with everybody ? ' i do n't even want to go to @entity3 or @entity70 next year , but i got no choice			0
' @entity100 's team - mate , @entity63 , echoed his views and said : ' that literally is bumper cars almost at 200 miles an hour , and i do n't know anybody who likes that			2
' loving it : fans can be spotted cheering as the cars continue to slide across the track the real deal : the drivers managed to complete 188 laps before the huge crash took place just a scratch : @entity142 managed to drive across the finish line after wrecking his car ‘ i 've gained a little bit of patience over the years , ’ said @entity57			1
‘ and i had to be patient two or three times			0
’ ‘ i saw @entity20 's back bumper and i saw him getting spun out , ’ he added			1
‘ i do n't know how that happened or how he got in that position , but i saw him spinning out and then when we were clear of him			0
’ after @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity153 and @entity154 were fourth and fifth respectively			0
@entity142 even managed to cross the finish line with smoke rising from his battered car after being caught up in the wreck			0
balls of fire : flames engulf @entity163 's car as @entity164 ( no 38 ) passes after wrecking on the last lap all ok ? no one involved in the crash was seriously injured			1

race leader @entity20 has bumper clipped at almost 200mph and turns car over causing 25 - car smash
crash happened on the final lap of @entity8 's @entity7 500 , with no one seriously injured
@entity57 was *fortunate* to escape the collision and went on to win the race
