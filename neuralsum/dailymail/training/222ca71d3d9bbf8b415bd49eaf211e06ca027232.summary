you may know them best for strutting their stuff on the catwalk or starring in hit tv shows and films			0
but @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are among the celebrities who have studied engineering			1
the @entity12 in @entity13 has shared a list of celebrities with @entity16 to highlight the breadth of appeal of engineering			1
while the subject may have not have prepared him for his acting career - aside perhaps from playing @entity42 - it may have stood him in good stead for his interest in tech start - ups			2
the actor has so far successfully invested in companies such as @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
@entity7 ( left ) studied chemical engineering at @entity26 before taking to the catwalk , while @entity29 studied mathematics and engineering at @entity31 before playing @entity33 in @entity55			1
she is pictured on the right receiving a @entity57 for her role in @entity36 @entity60 actor @entity59 who is known for his roles in action movies ( a shot from @entity64 is shown ) , has a degree in chemical engineering from the @entity67 in @entity68 , followed by a master 's degree in chemical engineering from the @entity72 in @entity73 before becoming the 108th mayor of @entity76 and a business magnate , @entity74 studied electrical engineering			1
actor @entity9 , the son of an engineer , studied the same subject and @entity60 actor @entity59 who is known for his roles in action movies , has a degree in chemical engineering from the @entity67 in @entity68 , followed by a master 's degree in chemical engineering from the @entity72 in @entity73			1
footballer @entity85 studied mechanical engineering at @entity88 his first big break came in @entity90 and he has recently starred alongside @entity91 and other action stars in @entity94 film franchise			1
and it is not just actors that set their sights on becoming engineers			2
footballer @entity85 studied mechanical engineering at @entity88 , while @entity101 , creator of @entity102 , was a software and telecommunications engineer , before drawing his famous comic strips			1
@entity105 , founder of rock band @entity106 , studied mechanical engineering at @entity108 and holds a number of patents , while @entity111 , a jazz musician , studied electrical engineering			2
a number of celebrities have expressed an interest in become more technically - minded too			2
for example , @entity116 has said that he would like to study computer science and has recently launched a smart watch , while model @entity120 , recently participated in ‘ @entity122 ’ to encourage people to learn how to create their own computer programmes			0
despite more people keen to build their own apps and a widespread interest in green technology , for example , there is a major shortage of engineers			2
in the @entity137 alone , 1.82 million new engineering , science and technology professionals will be needed by 2022 , for example			2
the @entity12 , which has been likened to a ‘ @entity139 ’ for engineering , aims to raise the public profile of engineering			1
the £ 1 million prize has this afternoon been awarded to chemical engineer @entity142 for his revolutionary advances in the fields of chemistry and medicine			0
@entity116 ( left ) has said that he would like to study computer science and has recently launched a smart watch ( also shown ) , while model @entity120 ( right ) , recently participated in ‘ @entity122 ’ to encourage people to learn how to create their own computer programmes the 2015 @entity12 has been awarded to the ground - breaking chemical engineer dr @entity142 for his revolutionary advances in the fields of chemistry and medicine			1
dr @entity142 has over 1,000 issued and pending patents , over 200 major prizes to his name , and is the most cited engineer in history			0
a chemical engineer by training , dr @entity142 was the first person to engineer polymers to control the delivery of large molecular weight drugs for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and mental illness			0
the 2015 @entity12 has been awarded to the ground - breaking chemical engineer dr @entity142 ( pictured ) for his revolutionary advances in the fields of chemistry and medicine his unconventional thinking toppled the established view that controlled - release drug delivery would not work for large molecules like proteins , which are very sensitive to their surroundings			1
dr @entity142 's work has helped lay the foundation for a myriad of health innovations , including the long - lasting brain cancer treatment called @entity181 and the prostate cancer and endometriosis treatments @entity184 , @entity185 , and @entity186 he is also behind the schizophrenia treatment @entity188 , the diabetes treatment @entity189 and the drug - coated cardiovascular stents that alone have benefited 10 million heart patients			0
his laboratory at the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) in @entity196 - with over 100 students , postdoctoral students , and visiting scientists at any one time - is the world 's largest academic biomedical engineering laboratory			0
one of dr @entity142 ’s most recent projects is a microchip - based implant capable of storing and releasing precise doses of a drug on - demand or at scheduled intervals for up to 16 years			0
the @entity207 is a global £ 1million prize that celebrates the engineers responsible for a ground - breaking innovation that has been of global benefit to humanity			0
the @entity213 will present the prize to dr @entity142 at @entity215 later this year .			0
