@entity3 could not believe his eyes when his @entity14 account in @entity15 credited him online with 490bn rupees , making him a billionaire on paper			1

the @entity14 have refused to explain how the huge fund ended up in mr @entity3 's account ' i called up a friend in the bank and joked , maybe money is overflowing in your bank , that 's why your system has remitted so much money into my account			2
' even though i got my money back , the account still holds the billions of dollars as uncleared amount			0
i do n't know how long i 'll have to keep that astronomical figure in my account			0
