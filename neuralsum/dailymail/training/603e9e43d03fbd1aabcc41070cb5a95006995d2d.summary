@entity0 ran the half marathon and won the event			0
half and full marathon runners set off at the same time , and mr @entity0 led the pack at the point when the error took place 5,000 runners have been told they fell short of completing a marathon last month by just 264m because of an organisational blunder			1
runners in the @entity12 took the wrong route along part of the course in @entity16 because they were given the wrong directions			1
organisers said the marshalling error meant all but one of the competitors did not complete the full marathon			1
@entity0 , who won the half marathon event , took the correct route along @entity16 's @entity26 at 26.2 miles , or about 42,000 metres , the marathon course was cut short by just 264m			1
this meant around 5,000 runners missed out on running the full length of the marathon or half - marathon courses at the event on april 28			2
event organisers told the @entity34 : ' regrettably , due to incorrect placing of marshals , which we take full responsibility for , only the lead athlete followed the correct route through the @entity41 area near the @entity26			2
' unfortunately , the second and third placed runners were not within line of sight of the leader and lead bikes / vehicle			0
' this resulted in all those who followed taking an incorrect route through this section			0
competitors who were running both full or half marathons did not fully complete the required 26.2 miles or 13.1 miles ' our course measures has now confirmed that 264 metres were therefore lost from the measured route			2
' we are sincerely sorry for any confusion and frustration that this has caused			0
' the organisers said they are offering the affected runners 25 % off entry to other events and said they hoped the error would not put competitors off future participation .			0

competitors were 264m short of running full marathon because of wrong directions
@entity12 *winner* @entity74 was only runner out of 5,000 who took the correct path
