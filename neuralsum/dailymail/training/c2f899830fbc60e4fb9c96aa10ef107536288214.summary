at first glance , @entity0 is just an ordinary everyday pug			2
pudgy face , cute skin rolls and a breathless little grunt that makes him all the more adorable			0
@entity0 is the star of a new video in which he takes going for a wee to the next level			0
the three - year - old , believed to be owned by @entity12 , is filmed outside his home in @entity14 on his two front paws doing a remarkable paw - stand while he pees			1
he walks around the concrete yard , anything but camera shy as his owner films			0
paw - stand peeing is nothing new for pugs , one of the quirks of the beloved breed from from @entity35 to @entity36 in the 16th century , but few are as impressive as @entity0			2
' his owner says no one taught him how to do it and that it has been a habit with him since he was a pup , ' says the @entity44 post			0
' while she and her children are used to seeing it , @entity0 's peeing technique never fails to put a smile on the face of bystanders every time they take him for a walk			1
' @entity0 's epic leek starts innocently enough , with the traditional leg - cocking technique on the curb but in one smooth move @entity0 , who is three and lives in @entity14 , is on his two front paws and he keep that pose while peeing for an incredible 67 seconds before a third paw touches the ground while his circus skills are admirable , unfortunately his front legs ca n't hold out as long as his bladder can produce its core product			1
when @entity0 's legs give way at the end of the video , and with no standard leg - cocking technique at his disposal , the little guy simple pees on his front foot			1
after all that effort !			0
