by @entity1 reporter published : 17:57 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 18:45 est , 16 february 2013 the world witnessed two galactic events on friday that had only a one in 100 million chance of happening on the same day , according to astronomy expert @entity5			2
the asteroid that flew within 17,000 miles of @entity7 was a once - in - 100 - years event , while the meteor that exploded over @entity10 was a once - in - a - decade occurrence , @entity5 wrote on @entity12			1
multiplying those two probabilities together results in a one in one hundred probability that they would happen on the same day			1
it penetrated @entity7 's atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,0000mph			1
as it raced through the sky , the 50 - foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it , creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time			1
although some debris fell to earth , ‘ whipping up a pillar of ice , water and steam ’ and creating a 20 - foot - wide crater , the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding			1
hours later , the 150 - foot , 130,000 - ton asteroid successfully skimmed past @entity7			1
it was the nearest fly - by for an object from space of this size since records began			1
although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 @entity91 hitting the planet , if it did , it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on @entity95			1
its closest approach , passing within 17,000 miles ( 27,357 kilometers ) , which is closer than some satellites , was at 7.25pm , @entity98 disaster : this graphic shows the sequence of events which led to the meteor crashing in @entity10 speed : @entity10 's space agency @entity105 said the meteorite was travelling at a speed of 30 km ( 19 miles ) per second and that such events were hard to predict interception : according to an unconfirmed report in @entity112 , the meteor was intercepted by @entity10 air defense shockwave : people heading to work in @entity27 heard what sounded like an explosion , saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave of the meteor , @entity120 , a resident of @entity27 , 930 miles east of @entity28 and the biggest city in the affected region , said : ‘ i really thought it was doomsday			1
’ teacher @entity125 , who tried to protect her pupils from the force of the blast said : ‘ there was an unreal light that lit up all the classrooms			2
‘ that kind of light does n’t happen in life , only at the @entity135 – then a trail appeared like from a plane but only ten times bigger			1
’ amazingly , there were no fatalities and most of the wounded were hurt by flying glass – some 1.8million square feet of which will have to be replaced			2
@entity10 news networks noted that the meteor struck just hours before the @entity7 was due had its closest recorded shave with an asteroid			1
however , space experts said the arrival of the much larger asteroid was merely a coincidence			2
professor @entity152 , of @entity153 , said there was ‘ almost definitely ’ no connection between the exploding meteor and asteroid 2012 @entity91			1
‘ this is literally a cosmic coincidence , although a spectacular one , ’ he said			2
prime minister @entity158 said the meteor could be a symbol for the vulnerability of the economy – and the ‘ whole planet ’			1
@entity165 experts said that thousands of tons of material from space rains down on the @entity7 each day , but nearly all of it burns up and disintegrates far from the view of the naked eye			1
occasionally a meteor can come so close that its explosion is felt , as happened yesterday , or a small meteorite or large asteroid can actually hit the planet			1
smoking : pictures show a streak of smoke followed by several bright blasts of flames coincidence : early indications are that the shower is unrelated to @entity185 , which is due to skim the orbit of the @entity7 later today high in the sky : the vapour trail of a falling meteorite is seen in the sky over the city of @entity27 injured : a man identifying himself as @entity194 poses for a photograph after receiving treatment for injuries after the meteorite shower hit the @entity10 region medical treatment : many injured had bloodied faces from being hit by shards of glass broken in the explosions toll : hundreds of people were injured , but there have been no reports of fatalities dr @entity210 , an astrophysicist from @entity211 , said : ‘ while events this big are rare , an impact that could cause damage and death could happen every century or so			1
' it very much depends on where it hits			2
a big enough meteor could cause significant immediate death and maybe cause climate change by releasing dust into the air – these are maybe every few thousand years			2
‘ and a really big impact occurs every few ten millions of years and can cause mass extinctions			0
‘ scientifically this is not hugely interesting			0
probably its greatest importance is to make people realise that things fall from space all the time , and every now and then they can be dangerous			0
‘ and an impact in a heavily populated area could kill huge numbers of people with no warning or chance of stopping it			0
' sonic boom : @entity242 , associate director of the @entity244 's @entity243 , said the injuries were caused when the meteor created a sonic boom causing windows to shatter explosion : eyewitnesses spoke of several devastating explosions rocking buildings and shattering glass damaged : a zinc factory in @entity27 was seen with a partially collapsed roof and walls in the morning after meteor pieces rained on the town moment of impact : a pair , seen on @entity261 , cower from the impact as the window near them explodes injured : four schoolchildren were known to have been injured from broken glass unexpected : eyewitnesses spoke of several devastating explosions rocking buildings and shattering glass one eyewitness @entity120 , in her 20s , gave a dramatic account of the meteorite , telling how she feared ' doomsday ' had arrived , reported the @entity276			2
' what was it ? people said it was a plane that fell and exploded , ' she said			0
' i saw a bright blast from behind me			0
everything was lit up , very bright light			0
' it was like from @entity50 movie when the meteorite rain started , i really thought it was like doomsday			0
' it was so scary especially the explosion			0
my camera could n't reproduce how strong the bang was			0
' ' i was sitting at home and typing something on my computer			0
suddenly there was a huge bright flash , ' said @entity300 , an historian and journalist from @entity27			0
hurt : a school in @entity27 took a fair brunt of the explosion - four students were injured blown out : a building damaged by the shockwave from the meteorite surprise : shocked residents look up in the sky with horror aftermath : people look at damage to a shop following the meteor shower shattered : the city of @entity27 , 900 miles east of @entity28 and close to the @entity30 border , took the brunt of the impact ' at first i thought something happened at my neighbours place but a minute later the sound of the explosion came			1
' he said ' many lost their windows , glass is everywhere in the streets '			0
children were left panic - stricken as windows smashed at @entity334 15 in @entity27			0
' first there was an unreal light that lit up all the classrooms on the right side of the school			0
that kind of light does n't happen in life , only at the @entity135 , then a trail appeared like from a plane but only 10 times bigger , ' said teacher @entity125			2
residents in one 19 storey block reported feeling the shockwaves of the explosions			0
the sounds of car alarms and breaking windows could be heard in the area , said a witness , and there were reports that the internet and mobile networks were temporarily down			0
destroyed : the building of the local zinc plant badly damaged by a shockwave from a meteorite impact getting to work : rescue servicemen work at the site of a collapsed wall and roof of the concentrate warehouse of the zinc plant in @entity27			0

asteroid flew within 17,000 miles of @entity7 several hours after a meteor shower over @entity10
asteroids fly close to the planet once a century while meteor showers happen about once every decade
