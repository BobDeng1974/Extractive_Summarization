by @entity0 as i posed for photographers on the @entity5 ’s red carpet last week , my show - stopping , sequinned frock made me feel a million dollars			1
and i ’m certain that as i took to the rostrum to conduct a full orchestra and choir of 280 in @entity10 ’s @entity9 at @entity11 — a musical event held in aid of the wonderful charity @entity14 , of which i am president — no one guessed my secret			1
for while my elegantly cut dress could easily have passed for a designer number worth thousands of pounds , it was in fact from @entity23 favourite @entity21 — with a much more modest ( although , admittedly , still significant ) price tag of £ 295			1
it is just one of a new wave of glamorous yet affordable red - carpet - worthy evening gowns hitting the shops in the nick of time for summer events			1
these full - length frocks are brilliant for older women like me because , as is the case with chunky jewellery , i find that in my 60s i can wear things that would overwhelm a younger woman			1
here ’s my verdict on the @entity23 ’s limelight - stealing dresses			1
i associate @entity48 more with reliable day wear than with evening sophistication , so this was a real find			0
it ’s extremely comfortable , beautifully graded in colour , and the v - neck gives a flattering flash of decolletage			1
£ 99 , debut at @entity59 a bargain , although that ’s somewhat reflected in the quality — it looks far more elegant than it feels			2
the draping is kind to the figure , though , and i love the classic , subtly sexy design			0
ideally the bodice would be boned and fitted , and the sheer top extended into sleeves , @entity71 - style , to make it perfect for all shapes and sizes			1
gold collar , £ 34.99 , hm.com i could n’t believe this dress cost just £ 34.99 , but when i put it on i realised it looked like something a footballer ’s wife might wear			2
it looks and feels flimsy and absolutely necessitates a strapless bra			0
on someone 20 and tanned it might just work , but on me it looks as cheap as it is			2
@entity87 sequin , £ 69.99 , quizclothing.co.uk the best value of the lot			0
eye - catching without being tacky , it can be stepped into so you can do your make - up and hair before getting dressed			2
if my budget was under £ 100 this is what i ’d choose			0
blue high neck , £ 275 , @entity99 at @entity100 this seemed like a real winner at first			0
it ’s well - made in a rich , silky fabric and fully lined , but to get it on , you have to pull it over your head , so i had to redo my hair and make - up			1
worst of all , the shape is unflattering			0
gold bead embellished , £ 184 , debenhams.com when i saw this i immediately thought ‘ mumsy ’ , but once i had it on , i loved it			0
an evening dress with sleeves is a fantastic find — perfect if you do n’t feel confident about baring your arms			1
it ’s also fully lined and easy to step into , and feels far more luxurious than i expected			0
good price for the quality			0
@entity125 multiway , £ 80 , bhs.co.uk this is n’t really a dress at all — it ’s an elasticated skirt with two very long pieces of fabric attached at the waist			2
the claim is that these can be used to create 15 different styles , but you ’d have to be pretty clever to do it and feel secure enough to venture out			2
although it comes in a lovely range of colours and the fabric is good , tying it is so fiddly i bet you ’d wear it once — before leaving it hanging reproachfully in the wardrobe .			0
