by @entity1 reporter created 2:00 pm on 7th december 2011 rev @entity2 said : ' some people , who provide essential services , have to work on christmas day - but i do n't feel that those employed by a fast - food restaurant should be in the same situation			1
' church leaders have hit out at a branch of @entity11 which is to open on christmas day			1
a @entity13 branch manager has been drafted in by the fast food outlet to cover for the usual boss who is taking the day off and staff have volunteered to work that day for seven hours			1
@entity17 said the decision to open the branch showed ' the continuing decline of @entity21 in this country ' and his reaction was ' one of great sadness '			1
he added : ' i ’m sad that we ’ve got to this point in our society where something that means as much as @entity31 seems to mean so little			1
' it shows the continuing decline of @entity21 in our country			2
' @entity34 , of @entity35 , said : ' some people , who provide essential services , have to work on christmas day - but i do n’t feel that those employed by a fast - food restaurant should be in the same situation			2
' @entity41 who has volunteered to manage the outlet said he expected a steady trade throughout the day			2
he said no staff who did not want to work that day were being forced to			2
he said : ' it ’s the first time the restaurant will open on december 25 and it ’s for the convenience of our customers			0
' there are people who work on @entity31 and they would normally struggle to find somewhere to eat			1
' i think the move will prove popular with @entity54 , and several customers have asked us whether we will be open			0
' it ’s difficult to say how many we are expecting but i think there will be a steady trade			0
' @entity60 , 43 , from @entity61 , @entity62 , was in the branch when she was asked if she would not be taking her children there that day			0
' there ’s no way i ’d take my kids for a @entity11 on christmas day , ' she said			0
' i suppose it ’s good news for people from different religions though			0
' however , the @entity73 , dr @entity74 , said he had ' no argument ' with the move			0
he said : ' @entity77 , @entity78 and the babe were lucky to find an innkeeper who helped them find a place to stay			0
he provided hospitality for them			0
' families and friends should come together at @entity31 , and if they want to do that in @entity89 ’s then who is the @entity90 to object ? ' a spokesman for @entity11 said many of the stores are franchises , adding : ' it is up to the individual store and their staff members which individuals work on christmas day			1
' it is not policy for staff members of a particular religion to work on any specific day - although staff who do not celebrate @entity31 may make the decision to work on december 25 themselves			1
' we expect there to be about 60 stores in the @entity110 that remain open this year , all in areas where there is a high demand for us to stay open , and where there are a large number of people who perhaps do not celebrate @entity31			1
' there have always been a small number of our stores which choose to open on december 25			0

' i ’m sad that we ’ve got to this point in our society where something that means as much as @entity31 seems to mean so little '
