@entity0 claimed the current system of university financing would leave a ' huge looming charge ' for taxpayers @entity6 's plan to cut tuition fees to £ 6,000 a year will inflict ' colossal damage ' on universities , top academics have warned today			1
@entity12 leaders said the move could leave them £ 10billion out of pocket and said it was ' implausible ' that the government could step in to make up the difference given the state of the public finances			1
but @entity6 hit back this morning , claiming the current system was unfordable for students and taxpayers			0
@entity0 said new figures showed half the student debts would never be repaid – leaving the government with a £ 2.5billion bill			1
but in a letter to the @entity30 , a group of university vice chancellors accused @entity6 of failing to understand that cutting fees will only benefit richer graduates – because under the present system , people only start paying back their loans once they earn more than £ 21,000 a year			1
student debts are also written off after 30 years			1
the vice-chancellors said mr @entity39 's plans to lower tuition fees by £ 3,000 would leave £ 2billion a year out of pocket			1
they fear future @entity6 governments would be unable to find an extra £ 2 billion a year in the present financial climate			1
sir @entity44 , vice-chancellor of the @entity12 , said : ' this is purely a pragmatic issue , that a policy is evolving on the hoof which is not really a practical policy going forward and the potential damage is colossal : ' i really feel @entity6 has missed the point here			0
if you talk to students and to many mums and dads , the £ 9,000 [ fee ] is no longer the key topic			1
' @entity59 , president of @entity60 , added : ' what our students tell us is that clearly the debts incurred through fees is important , but what would be a real game - changer for students , or what can defeat students , is the debt that arises from living expenses while they are at university			2
' if money were to be spent to support the most needy students to go to university , subsidising fees is not the way to do it			2
' cost cutting : @entity6 is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £ 9,000 a year to £ 6,000 but mr @entity0 claimed the current system of university financing would leave a ' huge looming charge ' for taxpayers as many graduates fail to pay back the cost of their tuition			1
' the universities are hugely important but the status quo is not working well at the moment for the students , for taxpayers and the government for a clear reason … we were told that the increase in fees to £ 9,000 would save money for taxpayers , save billions and deliver a good deal			1
' what we 've seen is graduate contributions go up by over 50 % , graduates paying for their fees , we 've seen money for universities go up by 28 % , but it turns out its costing taxpayers more not less , and the truth is we 're now in a position where almost half of students are n't repaying fees because they do n't earn enough in their lifetime ... there is a huge looming charge for taxpayers in the future			1
' what i want is a solution which is fair for students , which does n't stop students going to universities which protects the taxpayers and is also good for universities … the status quo is unsustainable , costly and hidden , @entity120 has played totally fast and loose with the public finances and we 're going to expose that			0
' the row comes after @entity136 figures revealed that the government 's decision to triple tuition fees will end up costing students and taxpayers more money – because half the loans will never be repaid			0
business secretary @entity144 said the @entity145 had lost a lot of support after agreeing to increase tuition fees - but insisted it was ' worth it ' ministers increased the cap on student fees from £ 3,000 to £ 9,000 a year to fill the hole in university funding left by government cuts to the higher education budget			1
but , because student debs are written off after 30 years , 49.5 per cent will never be recouped , meaning the scheme will cost the government £ 2.5billion a year more than ministers claimed , @entity136 library figures show			1
at the same time average graduate debts have doubled from £ 20,000 in 2010 to £ 43,500			2
it comes after @entity162 , the shadow business secretary , revealed @entity6 would introduce a ' graduate tax ' on the earnings of those who go to university to replace tuition fees			1
mr @entity162 said the system would be ' fairer ' than tuition fees and would be introduced ' in the medium term ' if @entity6 returns to power			0
the @entity171 proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £ 15,000 , for a period of 20 years , with the highest earners paying higher rates			2
@entity6 is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £ 9,000 a year to £ 6,000			1
@entity162 revealed @entity6 would introduce a ' graduate tax ' on the earnings of those who go to university to replace tuition fees in 2011 , it announced the policy as it sought to win over disaffected former @entity145 voters angered by @entity187 reneging on a pledge to scrap fees and signing up to @entity190 plans to allow institutions to charge up to £ 9,000 a year – triple the amount students paid previously			1
the £ 6,000 cap is expected to be included in @entity6 's general election manifesto , but it is not clear how the party intends to meet such an expensive commitment			2
previously , @entity6 has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better - off students			2
the party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees , leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost			2
mr @entity162 , who is responsible for higher education policy , said introducing a full - scale graduate tax ' as soon as possible is my priority '			1
@entity39 's campaign chief @entity215 attacked the decision to increase tuition fees			2
she said : ' @entity0 has long said that he thinks that the current system [ of tuition fees ] needs to change and a report out this morning , figures we 've gained from the @entity222 this morning show that the new funding arrangement , the increased tuition fees to £ 9,000 a year is actually costing the taxpayer more because half of those loans that people are having to take out wo n't be repaid			1
' so we 've got young people leaving university with £ 30,000 , £ 40,000 worth of debt			2
nearly half of them wo n't actually repay those loans so it 's costing the taxpayer more anyway			0
' the decision to hike tuition fees is one of the most controversial decisions of the @entity190			0
@entity187 , appearing on the comedy show @entity241 on friday admitted it had given him sleepless nights			0
however he also continued to defend the decision , adding : ' i 'm not prime minister so i ca n't do what i want			0
' the @entity145 have pointed to figures showing the gap between the number of rich and poor students wanting to go on to higher education had fallen since 2010			0
business secretary @entity144 has described the new system as ' better , affordable and fair '			0
he said : ' we have paid a price for this policy more than any other party			0
but the success of these reforms , with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university than ever before , shows it was a price worth paying			0
' regardless of family circumstances , all students can now obtain university level education as long as they meet academic requirements			0
this is a good legacy			0
' the figures , from university admissions service @entity267 , show 21 per cent of 18 - year - olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in @entity271 applied this year			0
overall , the richest 18 - year - olds in the @entity273 are 2.4 times more likely to want to go to university than the poorest			0
but in 2006 , when @entity6 was in power , the wealthiest were 3.7 times more likely to want to apply .			0

@entity39 has previously pledged to cut fees by £ 3,000 after the election
@entity280 eventually wants to scrap fees and introduce a ' graduate tax '
but university leaders say cutting fees will leave them £ 10 billion short
they say it is ' implausible ' ministers can afford to make up the *shortfall*
*coalition* increased the cap on student fees from £ 3,000 to £ 9,000 a year
but student debts written off after 30 years so 50 % will not be recouped
