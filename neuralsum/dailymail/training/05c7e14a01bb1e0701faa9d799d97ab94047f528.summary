but last night @entity5 and @entity6 did not put a well - shod foot wrong as they arrived for a private party at @entity11 's @entity10 looking catwalk ready			2
the young royals both chose brightly coloured dresses that fitted their figures perfectly			2
for @entity5 , a screen - printed mini dress that revealed toned legs			1
for @entity6 , a vivid coral dress with cap sleeves , a fitted waistline and a deep v - neckline , all of which served to enhance her petite hourglass figure			1
stylish : often criticised for their over-the - top fashion choices , at a party in @entity11 last night the girls looked glamorous in simple dresses with classic accessories @entity30 was present at the party too , arriving in a @entity32 flag dress , thought to be designed by @entity33 , which she paired with a pair of classic @entity33 moulded toe shoes			1
the party was also attended by @entity38 and her brother @entity39 , who were forced to cut short their day in the royal box at @entity42 in order to attend			1
the @entity45 ' early exit from the tennis tournament meant that they missed @entity48 's incredible defeat by @entity50 player @entity49 after the game ran until almost 10pm			2
colour matching : @entity5 picked out the colours of her dress with midnight blue clutch and sandals , while @entity6 accessorised hers just as the @entity57 herself would - with black bag and shoes party time : @entity5 attended the event , held in @entity10 in @entity11 , with her boyfriend @entity62 left : artist @entity30 in @entity64 dress and @entity33 shoes			1
right , a guest makes the most of the summery weather last night with a floaty dress split to the thigh spectacular venue : the party took place in @entity10 , a @entity74 - listed property on @entity75 in @entity11			1
it is the only surviving part of the mansion of @entity10 , built in 1466 by wool merchant @entity78 the simple silhouettes were a savvy choice for the girls , both of whom have very good figures , but who often fail to show them off to their best advantage			0
instead of wearing figure - skimming clothes like these that enhance the body , the girls often end up in too - tight pencil skirts that appear to be stretched across their thighs , making them look bigger than they are			1
the warm weather was a blessing , and meant the girls left their jackets at home			0
too often they wear boxy jackets that add bulk , or button up too tightly across their bodies			0
a touch looser is better - strained buttons or stretched fabric adds pounds that are n't there			0
royal blush : nice dresses , but both girls could have done with a touch more make up @entity5 's high hemline showed off great legs honed from running , while @entity6 's vintage - style tailoring showed off the fact that the royal 's waist is in fact tiny - something that is sometimes lost when the princesses wear badly fitting clothing			0
the only negative ? @entity6 's hair is crying out for some volume - someone give that girl some rollers			0
and both , but especially @entity6 , could do with more make up			0
a bold pink lip , some blusher , bronzer and mascara would take @entity6 , who has beautiful bone structure , from dressed - up teen to elegant princess			0
her black shoes , too are a tad heavy for summer , and for the bright dress they accompany - but we 'd take them over the dreadful standard - issue nude pumps the female royals ca n't get enough of any day .			1
