a mysterious ancient creature , resembling both a @entity1 and a modern human , has been unearthed in @entity3			1
fossils dating back 60,000 and 120,000 years have revealed an unknown species that does n't seem to fit with any known hominin ancestor			0
scientists claim one explanation for the remarkable find may be that the fossils were the result of interbreeding between two known species			1
a mysterious ancient creature , resembling both a @entity1 and a modern human , has been unearthed in @entity3			1
the fossils , discovered in a cave in the @entity18 site in 1976 , are made up of skull fragments			1

@entity27 of the @entity28 on @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity26 recently made a new analysis of the teeth			2
she focused on the size and shape of the crown and root system , as well as the cusps , grooves and their positions relative to each other , according to a report in the @entity42			0
the teeth were then compared to 5,000 other teeth that have been found from other known hominin species			0

rather than being a new species , scientists claim another explanation for the remarkable find may be that the fossils were the result of interbreeding between two known species @entity27 of the @entity28 on @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity26 recently made a new analysis of the teeth			1
she focused on the size and shape of the crown and root system , as well as the cusps , grooves and their positions relative to each other			0
pictured is a computer model of the analysis @entity69 may be closer to their @entity1 cousins than previously thought , research last year suggested			1
breeding with @entity1 has long been known to have left its traces in the dna of modern @entity69			0
scientists in @entity75 have now confirmed that the genetic similarity between the two must have arisen after interbreeding in @entity69 and @entity78 , before our ancestors spread across the globe			2
previous research speculated that modern @entity69 and @entity83 are related to @entity1 because they originated from a similar sub-population in @entity85			2
both groups evolved from a common ancestor in @entity85 before spreading to other parts of the world			0
the two groups emerged at different times with @entity1 leaving the @entity85 continent more than 200,000 years before humans did			0
scientists at the @entity95 and @entity96 found the species mated in @entity69 and @entity78 thousands of years ago			2
' each of those slopes , grooves , valleys define a pattern or combination of features that can be distinctive of a population , ' @entity27 told @entity105 at the @entity42			0
some of the teeth had features that resembled the older species @entity107 , while some appeared more @entity1			1
' they have a mixture of something very primitive , which is currently unknown , ' said professor @entity27			0
' we can not go further to say it 's a new species because we need to compare it to other things			0
' while modern humans were in @entity85 , scientists are aware of four groups of early humans living elsewhere on the planet			0
the @entity1 lived in @entity69 , @entity122 in @entity123 , the @entity124 in @entity78 and the @entity122 in @entity123			1
one possibility is that these fossils belong to @entity124 – a mysterious species which co-existed and interbred with our human ancestors			1
but @entity130 of the @entity131 in @entity132 says surface features on the teeth strongly suggests a new , unrecognised species , distinct from @entity124			2
researchers are now hoping they will find more bones in other parts of @entity78 that could help solve the mystery			0
a separate study published last week suggests there is yet another new primitive human species that may have lived in @entity78			1
the six permanent maxillary teeth of the unknown species			0
these are the teeth along the top of the human mouth			0
they rest along the upper jawbone , or maxilla , and have roots that extend into the upper jawbon the fossils were discovered in a cave in the @entity18 site of norther @entity3 in 1976			1
the latest study took a fresh look at the evidence to find a mysterious creature that shared traits neanderthals and human ancestors while modern humans were in @entity85 , scientists are aware of four groups of early humans living elsewhere on the planet			0
the @entity1 lived in @entity69 , @entity122 in @entity123 and the @entity124 in @entity78 and the @entity122 in @entity123			1
one possibility is that these fossils belong to @entity124 – a mysterious species which co-existed and interbred with our human ancestors			1
fishermen working off the coast of @entity173 dredged up the jawbone of an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago			1
the short , thick mandible has unusually large teeth and a strong jaw compared to other human fossils found in @entity78 , according to anthropologists			1
the discovery , like the most recent one in @entity3 , suggests that it belonged to an previously unknown ancient human lineage			2
experts say it means that there may have been several species of early human living in @entity78 until modern humans arrived 55,000 years ago			1
the fossilised jawbone was the first ancient hominin remains to be found in @entity173			2
it was dredged up in a fishing net from the @entity196 submarine channel , about 15 miles ( 25km ) off the west coast of @entity173			2
a separate study published last week suggests there is yet another new primitive human species that may have lived in @entity78			1
fishermen working off the coast of @entity173 dredged up the jawbone ( pictured ) an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago			1
the @entity196 mandible ( centre ) found off the coast of @entity173 is much larger than the lower jawbones of @entity107 from @entity209 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) , despite its much younger age according to the researchers during the @entity214 between 2.5 million and 11,000 years ago , periods of low sea level would have meant the area was part of the mainland of @entity78			1
anthropologists from the @entity219 in @entity173 and the @entity220 in @entity221 who studied the newly discovered fossils say it is unlike any of the other fossilised ancient humans that spread through out @entity78			1
homo erectus , remains of which have been found in @entity209 , @entity123 , and mainland @entity3 , tended to have much narrower jawbones and smaller teeth			2
researchers say that this suggests the robust - jawed ' @entity196 man ' had a different evolutionary origin from the ' classic ' homo erectus found in the area			0
it could mean that it is either an entirely new species or a rare subgroup of @entity107			2
scientists used @entity241 to create the virtual reconstruction above of the jawbone discovered in @entity244 this graphic above shows how the @entity196 1 fossil may fit into the complex timeline of human evolution dr @entity249 , an anthropologist at the @entity220 in @entity221 who was involved in the study , told @entity252 : ' it is a well - preserved mandible - a small fragment but contains a lot of information useful to evaluate its evolutionary position			2
' what we can say is that it is clearly different from the known homo erectus populations from northern @entity3 and @entity209 , and likely represent a group that has been so far unrecognized so			0
' he added that the species would have looked very different from modern humans			0
he said : '' the new @entity173 mandible is markedly different from us in robusticity , not size , of the mandible			0
' width of the bone at the lateral part of the mandible is 20.7 mm ( 0.8 inches ) for @entity196 , but on average 14 mm ( 0.55 inches ) for fossil modern humans			0
' the @entity276 ( seen above ) , where the jawbone was found , was once been part of mainland @entity78			0

the fossils were discovered in a cave in @entity18 , @entity3
they are made up of skull pieces , and teeth from four individuals
teeth had features similar to @entity107 as well as @entity1
one possibility is that the creature was the result of interbreeding
analysis of a jawbone dredged up in @entity173 last week suggested there is yet another new primitive human species that may have lived in @entity78
