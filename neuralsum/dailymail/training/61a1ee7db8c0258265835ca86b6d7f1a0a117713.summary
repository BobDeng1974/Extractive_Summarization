by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity2 refused to break off his holiday and recall @entity4 last night despite @entity5 deploying warplanes to @entity7			1
in a significant escalation of @entity5 involvement in the crisis , the bombers will take on surveillance and reconnaissance duties			1
the @entity14 are also capable of attacking enemy targets with bombs and missiles			1
ministers have already pledged to consider supplying arms to @entity21 fighters battling against @entity23 fanatics			1
@entity5 tornado jets will soon fly over @entity7 plight : several ministers are on holiday ( left ) while @entity31 people flee the terror of @entity29 in @entity7 the developments raise the prospect of @entity5 joining the @entity44 in taking a more active role – all at a time when the country ’s leaders are on holiday			1
the prime minister is in @entity50 where officials insist he is in close touch with ministers and officials and is still running the country			1
his deputy , @entity56 leader @entity56 , is in @entity57			1
home secretary @entity58 is on an @entity60 break , and first secretary of state @entity61 , who has been mr @entity2 ’s official deputy in previous summers , is also abroad			1
it leaves foreign secretary @entity65 as the most senior minister in @entity67 , even though he has only been in his job for a month			1
however @entity69 defied mounting calls for mps to return to work , insisting our role was solely humanitarian			2
the sense of disarray at the heart of government intensified yesterday as foreign office minister @entity79 stepped down less than a week after the resignation of @entity81 over what she described as the government ’s ‘ morally indefensible ’ position on @entity85			2
exhausted : a @entity31 baby rescued from the mountains of northern @entity7 by @entity21 forces as thousands flee tent city : thousands of refugees from @entity7 are being housed at a temporary camp in @entity93 , @entity34 @entity94 accused the government of being ‘ rudderless ’ and former foreign secretary @entity96 called for a concerted action			2
‘ one way or another , these maniacs , these medieval maniacs in the so - called @entity23 have got to be defeated , ’ he said			1
number 10 said mr @entity65 was one of the most experienced ministers in government and had done sterling work in recent weeks			2
he chaired the emergency cobra committee yesterday , which was attended by the new defence secretary @entity106			2
but @entity94 said the fact that three of the @entity110 ministers had been in the office for a month or less meant the department lacked the expertise or experience to deal with simultaneous crises in @entity7 , @entity85 and @entity116			2
the party had to issue its statement though through junior foreign affairs spokesman @entity119 , because @entity94 leader @entity120 is also on holiday			2
mr @entity119 said : ‘ the new foreign secretary has now lost two ministers in just a few days			0
‘ at a time when the @entity110 should be focused both on the crisis in @entity7 and the situation in @entity85 following the recent appalling violence there , @entity128 instead risks looking increasingly rudderless , and characterised by confusion			0
’ there were continued demands for a recall of @entity4 to discuss the crisis in @entity7 and for potential military action by @entity5 forces			1
departing minister mr @entity79 told the @entity136 he would support further action to protect stricken communities in the north of @entity7			0
‘ if it is the collective international view that air strikes would be the best way to support the @entity144 , then we should be supporting the @entity44 , ’ he added			0
‘ we should be supporting the @entity44 in that way , but i ’m not sure we should be putting troops on the ground			0
’ mr @entity65 dismissed the call , saying : ‘ we do n’t envisage a combat role at the present time			0
‘ we are talking at the moment about a humanitarian operation and using our assets to gain more awareness of what ’s going on			0
’ @entity158 mps @entity156 and @entity159 have written to the prime minister urging the recall of @entity4 to discuss the crises in @entity7 and @entity85 , while fellow conservative @entity163 said he wanted to send in special forces to assist @entity165 in @entity7			0
refuge : this group of children are among some 45,000 people so far to cross the @entity7 - @entity34 border tired : a @entity31 child catches a brief moment of rest as she makes her way from @entity29 to @entity34 former defence minister @entity175 said it was ‘ no good just sending aid ’ – the ‘ real solution ’ was to stop is fighters			0
‘ there are many ways one can use military action , ’ he told the @entity180 ’s @entity181			0
‘ air strikes , or indeed the use of [ drones ] , from a suitable launch site , are ways that it can be done – dare one say it – surgically without putting troops on the ground			0
’ two sentinel spy planes are also being relocated to @entity195 from @entity196 , making them available for operations in @entity7			0
lord @entity199 , the former army chief , warned the risk of a genocide unfolding meant further help should be considered , arguing that the @entity5 shared ‘ some culpability ’ for the breakdown in @entity7 society			1
@entity206 indicated that @entity5 may be willing to follow the example of the @entity44 in arming @entity21 forces			1
the prime minister ’s spokesman insisted mr @entity2 was ‘ very much engaged ’ with the situation despite being abroad and a recall of @entity4 was ‘ not on the cards ’			1
in a further blow to the prime minister , @entity94 has jumped to a seven - point lead over the @entity158 party , according to a @entity220 / @entity219 poll			0
labour support has gone up five points over the past month to 38 per cent while the @entity158 have fallen by three to 31 per cent .			0

@entity14 to carry out surveillance and are capable of attacking with missiles
it is a major escalation of @entity5 involvement in fight against @entity23
but @entity2 , @entity58 , @entity56 and @entity61 all abroad
