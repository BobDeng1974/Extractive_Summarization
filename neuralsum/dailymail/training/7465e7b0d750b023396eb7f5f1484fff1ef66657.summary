from edge - to - edge , @entity1 's ring system would be too big to fit in the distance between @entity4 and the moon			1
but now a new ring system has been found that dwarfs @entity1 's enormous structure – and it 's the first of its kind to be seen outside our solar system			1
astronomers discovered more than 30 rings eclipsing the very young sun - like star @entity15 , each of them tens of millions of miles in diameter			1
there are gaps in the rings , which indicate that exomoons may have formed			1
pictured is an artist 's impression by @entity33 the rings were first spotted in 2012 by the @entity35 in the @entity36 , and the @entity37 in @entity38			2
a new analysis of the data , led by @entity42 's @entity41 , shows that there are gaps in the rings , which indicate that exomoons may have formed in the space			1
' the details that we see in the light curve are incredible , ' said professor @entity41			0
' the eclipse lasted for several weeks , but you see rapid changes on time scales of tens of minutes as a result of fine structures in the rings			0
' @entity57 is much too far away to observe the rings directly , but we could make a detailed model based on the rapid brightness variations in the star light passing through the ring system			2
' if we could replace @entity1 's rings with the rings around @entity66 , they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon			1
' from edge - to - edge , @entity1 's ring system ( pictured here by the @entity71 probe ) would be too big to fit in the distance between @entity4 and the moon			1
but now a new ring system has been found that dwarfs @entity1 's enormous structure – and it 's the first of its kind outside our solar system the astronomers analysed data from the @entity85 project – a survey that is designed to detect gas giants that move in front of their parent star			1
their conclusions is that the companion is likely to be a giant planet – not yet seen – with a gigantic ring system responsible for the repeated dimming of @entity97 's light			1
the star is similar in mass to the sun , but is much younger			2
astronomers believe it to be about 16 million years old or 1/300th the age of the solar system			0
it lies about 420 light years away			0
there are more than 30 rings eclipsing the very young sun - like star			1
each of these rings tens of millions of miles in diameter			2
if we could replace @entity1 's rings with the rings around @entity66 , they would be easily visible at night			1
the mass of @entity117 is most likely in the range of about 10 to 40 @entity120 masses			0
the researchers encourage amateur astronomers to help monitor @entity97			2
they want to detect the next eclipse of the rings , to find out the definite mass of the ringed companion			0
the light curve tells astronomers that the diameter of the ring system is nearly 120 million kilometers , more than two hundred times as large as the @entity124			1
the ring system , 420 light years from @entity4 , likely contains roughly an @entity4 's worth of mass in light - obscuring dust particles			2
professor @entity136 puts into context how much material is contained in these disks and rings			0
' if you were to grind up the four large @entity144 moons of @entity120 into dust and ice and spread out the material over their orbits in a ring around @entity120 , the ring would be so opaque to light that a distant observer that saw the ring pass in front of the sun would see a very deep , multi-day eclipse , ' he said			2
' in the case of @entity97 , we see the rings blocking as much as 95 per cent of the light of this young sun - like star for days , so there is a lot of material there that could then form satellites			1
' in the data the astronomers found at least one clean gap in the ring structure , which is more clearly defined in the new model			0
' one obvious explanation is that a satellite formed and carved out this gap , ' said professor @entity41			0
' the mass of the satellite could be between that of @entity4 and @entity178			0
the satellite would have an orbital period of approximately two years around @entity66			2
' astronomers expect that the rings will become thinner in the next several million years and eventually disappear as satellites form from the material in the disks			0
' the planetary science community has theorised for decades that planets like @entity120 and @entity1 would have had , at an early stage , disks around them that then led to the formation of satellites , ' professor @entity136 explains			2
' however , until we discovered this object in 2012 , no - one had seen such a ring system			0
this is the first snapshot of satellite formation on million - kilometer scales around a substellar object			0
' astronomers estimate that the ringed companion @entity117 has an orbital period roughly a decade in length			0
the mass of @entity117 has been difficult to determine , but it is most likely in the range of about 10 to 40 @entity120 masses			0
the researchers encourage amateur astronomers to help monitor @entity97 , which would help detect the next eclipse of the rings , and constrain the period and mass of the ringed companion			1
professor @entity41 adds that finding eclipses from more objects like @entity97 's companion ' is the only feasible way we have of observing the early conditions of satellite formation for the near future			1
' @entity97 's eclipses will allow us to study the physical and chemical properties of satellite - spawning circumplanetary disks			1
' ' the details that we see in the light curve are incredible , ' said professor @entity41			0
' the eclipse lasted for several weeks , but you see rapid changes on time scales of tens of minutes as a result of fine structures '			0

the massive rings were seen eclipsing the young sun - like star @entity97
there are gaps in the rings , which indicate exomoons may have formed
their diameter is more than two hundred times as large as @entity1 's rings
if we could replace @entity1 's rings with the rings around @entity66 , they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon
