a @entity1 climber miraculously escaped death twice after being pummelled with rocks ' the size of cars ' while ice climbing in @entity7			1
@entity8 , 28 , had just completed her lifetime ambition of ice climbing in @entity7 when rocks began to hurtle down the glacier towards her as she waited to be rescued by helicopter			1
the climbers ran to take cover at the edge of a helipad but , just minutes after the rocks stopped flying over their heads , a second fall was triggered			2
after completing an ice climb in @entity7 , 28 - year - old @entity8 found herself faced with death during not one - but two - rockfalls on the @entity24 ( pictured ) @entity8 , from @entity25 , miraculously escaped with just a small bump on her head			1
she described her brush with death : ' i heard this massive thunderclap			1
i turned round and i saw a mass of cloud and rocks and noticed our guide 's face had gone from normal to sheer panic as the rocks started to hurl towards us			2
' ' i had my hands over my head to protect it because even the smaller rocks could 've wiped me out			2
' ' boulders the size of cars and fridges were flying past us , and one the size of a microwave seemed to skim past my head			1
' ' we were hunkered down for what seemed like forever and i was just thinking , " any minute now , we 're going to get crushed			0
" ' ' boulders the size of cars and fridges were flying past us , and one the size of a microwave seemed to skim past my head , ' @entity8 remembers of the experience the @entity61 native was backpacking around @entity7 and on that day , the group had spent the day scaling @entity24 in @entity63			1
the @entity65 environmental sciences student said she was ' buzzing ' after surviving the first rockfall			0
but the second struck as the climbers were waiting to board the helicopter - forcing it to take off without them			0
' i was thinking , " i 've just cheated death ! , " and not many people can say that - so i was buzzing			2
' ' when the second rockfall happened my sense of humour failed - i just wanted to get off the ice			0
' ' i just thought , " get me out of here " - whereas before i was thinking , " yes , i 'm alive			0
' @entity25 native @entity8 's lifetime ambition was to try ice climbing in @entity7 after the second rockfall the group was able to make it safely back to base , but @entity8 suffered from severe paranoia for several days and returned home to @entity25 early			1
she still climbs , and has chosen to learn more about natural hazards as part of her course			0
she says the experience has given her a new perspective on life			0
' i 'd cheated death twice and was convinced it was coming for me but it is an awesome story , ' she said			0
' it 's made me a lot stronger and more determined to not shy away from something just because i 'm nervous or i do n't like it			1
