@entity0 recorded a night to remember on wednesday as @entity2 's side earned a place in the @entity5 quarter - finals after a 2 - 0 win against @entity7			1
goals from @entity9 and @entity10 ensured the win for the @entity12 against a @entity7 side which started with @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
here , @entity18 's @entity17 gives his verdict on how the players performed at the @entity21			2
@entity9 ( centre ) wheels away in celebration after his early goal against @entity7 @entity7 : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity26 5.5 nutmegged for the opener and beaten quite easily for the second , did little to press claims for a run in the team			1
@entity32 5.5 done all ends up for @entity10 ’s excellent second and did not get to grips with @entity9 all night			1
@entity34 5.5 dithered when presented with one glorious first - half chance to level			2
@entity36 5 clumsy – he looks anything but a £ 30million @entity39 centre back			0
@entity40 5.5 struggled to contain @entity41 at times and did n’t offer a great deal in attack			0
should have been sent off for trip on @entity41 in area			0
@entity14 ( centre ) struggled to make an impact against a spirited @entity0 midfield @entity50 6 a frustrating night , he tried his best to make things happen but it just did n’t come off			1
@entity14 ( off 59 ) 5.5 just did not impact his superiority yet again , especially against young opponents			2
@entity55 5 was guilty of dawdling in possession at the cost of the opening goal			1
@entity55 was caught in possession in the early stages , leading to @entity0 's opener @entity15 was forced off with an injury just nine minutes into the first half @entity15 ( off 9 ) injury woe and now a doubt for the derby			1
@entity67 5 precious little impact in the final third			0
@entity16 failed to make an impact as @entity7 struggled against @entity0 substitutes @entity73 ( on 9 & off 70 ) 5.5 floated around the periphery of the game without making any difference			1
@entity77 ( on 59 ) 5.5 like all of his team - mates , failed to make a telling impact			2
@entity82 ( on 70 ) 6 too late for him to save the day this time			0
@entity82 did n't have enough time to save @entity7 after coming on in the 70th minute @entity0 : ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity84 6.5 relatively untroubled but did what he had to with minimum fuss			1
@entity87 ( off 63 ) 7 continues to look a class act – just why did n’t want of the bigger boys take a chance on him at £ 5m ? @entity92 7.5 another assured performance from the skipper – he is the picture of cool and organised a young backline			0
@entity92 ( left ) looked assured at the back and stayed strong throughout @entity99 7 switched to centre back from the left and did not look out of place			0
@entity102 7 offered as much in attack as he did in defence and might just have done enough to keep his place for @entity106			0
@entity107 8 what a reintroduction after 26 months out – first he crocks @entity15 and then sets up the opener			2
@entity112 7 was strong in the tackle and crisp with his passing , a solid performance			2
@entity41 fires a shot towards goal during the @entity5 clash at the @entity21 @entity120 6.5 knitted play together in the middle of the park without being spectacular			0
@entity41 7 a willing runner , as ever , and caused problems for @entity125 down the right			0
@entity127 6.5 it was n’t the easiest of tasks as a lone frontman , but the teenager stuck to it and did n’t afford his minders a moment ’s rest			0
@entity9 ( off 46 ) 7.5 terrorised @entity7 with his skill and pace and took his goal with the confidence of a seasoned striker , not an 18 - year - old rookie			1
@entity143 terrorised @entity7 's defence and scored the opening goal before coming off at half - time substitutes @entity148 ( on 46 ) 6.5 followed up his game - changing performance at @entity150 with another tricky 45 minutes			1
@entity10 ( on 63 ) 7.5 was brought on to help see home a 1 - 0 but made it safe with his quite brilliant second			1
@entity155 ( on 63 ) 6 took up the baton from @entity127 .			0
