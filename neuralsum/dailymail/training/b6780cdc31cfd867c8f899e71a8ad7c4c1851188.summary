a notorious former strip club has been transformed into a luxury boutique hotel in @entity2 , @entity3			1
built around the history and culture of @entity7 , the @entity4 is a hotel that values collaboration with its neighbours			0
filled with custom furniture , craftwork from local purveyors and found objects from @entity15 and beyond , the @entity4 revels in the details			0
but just three years ago the building was in disrepair - once used as a brothel and strip club , designer and developer @entity22 decided to breatehe new life into the dilapidated eyesore			1
designer and developer @entity22 has utilised original themes from the strip club in a fascinating new look the bar where ladies would dance and entertain the crowds is now a chillout area - but notice the drawing on the wall and a hark back in time the tired and tacky green shutters have been ripped off , and the exterior of the hotel looks fresh and inviting to the tourism industry built in 1912 , the building was originally meant to house the clergy , but by the time @entity43 came around , it became a shelter for the poor and impoverished			1
then , as theatre took over the downtown @entity7 area , the building became a pit - stop for actors and actresses			1
but then the area fell into decline , and it became a strip club , with 60 hourly rooms upstairs			2
the renovation works took two - and - a - half years to complete , and now the building has had a much - needed focus the @entity4 is filled with custom furniture , craftwork from local purveyors and found objects from @entity15 and beyond the exit door to the old strip club - girls would have come and gone through here , earning their living while entertaining their ' clients ' interestingly , the shapes from the old strip club have been incorporated into the hotel 's fresh and clean design @entity22 used to walk past the strip club , and once it had shut down , he seized upon the opportunity for his next project these rooms are a far cry to what was there before , where strippers used to entertain their clients , with the furniture of high standard the bathrooms in the rooms at the @entity4 are beautifully designed and add a real touch of class to the building , and right , the bright walkways built around the history and culture of @entity7 , the @entity4 is a hotel that values collaboration with its neighbours and really stands out speaking to @entity91 , mr @entity22 said : ' it was in that condition up until the moment we bought it			1
i went to the building on the last day of its active strip club life			1
the next day , the lights were off and that was the end of that			0
' ' there were definitely moments of panic , where it felt highly unrealistic that we would be able to make something out of that			0
' there was nothing good happening in those rooms			0
they did everything wrong to make the space feel as disturbing as possible			0
' fast forward two - and - a - half years and the refub is complete - rooms are eloquently designed with decor from @entity120 and @entity121 , while working with the original layout of the building and structure			2
there is a restaurant , a coffee shop , a bar , and a karaoke lounge , as well as 52 beautifully - designed bedroom suites			2
certain themes from its past remain , for example there is an artistic drawing of a naked woman on the walls of the bar .			0

historic construction transformed into luxury , 52 - room boutique hotel that *maintains* links with its past
