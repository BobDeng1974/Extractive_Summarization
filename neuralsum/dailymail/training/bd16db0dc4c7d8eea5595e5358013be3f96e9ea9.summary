the survey revealed only 19 per cent of members believe mr @entity10 will lead the party to victory in 2015			1

it reveals a growing disconnect between mr @entity10 and his members , with almost half saying they now spend no time campaigning for his re-election as prime minister			2
many of them are actively considering switching to back @entity5 , in a major boost for @entity28 ’s party			1
the damning verdict comes just two months after party relations were shattered by claims a senior @entity4 figure had dismissed activists as ' swivel - eyed loons '			1
mr @entity10 was forced to publicly declare his support for party members after the insult was used to explain why @entity4 @entity64 voted against gay marriage plans , under pressure from their local associations			1
unpopular : coalition policies on gay marriage and ring - fencing international development from cuts are opposed by @entity4 activists the research was carried out by @entity31 for @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity36			1
it is unusual to see surveys of party members because lists of names are not released , but the polling firm has identified 852 individuals from its previous work			2
the study emerged as former defence secretary @entity83 stepped up his attacks on the @entity85 , attacking the political class in @entity87 for ' fanning the flames of frustration ' by failing to listen to fears about immigration across the @entity85			2
@entity93 commissioners are ‘ paving the way for extremists ’ by turning a blind eye to increasing concerns about immigration , @entity83 warned today as he called for a policy that puts ‘ the @entity6 people first ’			0

in a speech to the @entity105 in @entity106 he also called for reforms that would make it easier for international workers with skills needed in @entity6 to enter the country but tougher for those that are a ‘ burden ’ on the state			0
he indicated a green - card style system could be introduced as part of an ‘ open and shut ’ immigration system			2
‘ nobody should assume they have the right to come to our country because they have relatives already here or because they happen to reside in some remote corner of the @entity85 , ’ he said			0
respondents were asked to say whether they would consider voting for @entity5 on a scale of one to 10 , with the top rating indicating a definite ‘ yes ’ and 0 meaning they would ‘ never ’ defect			2
some 19 per cent gave a score of eight or above , while nine per cent said they would definitely switch			0
only a fifth ( 19 per cent ) think the @entity4 will win an overall majority in the 2015 general election , with 10 per cent predicting a second coalition with the @entity141			1
a further 12 per cent think the @entity142 could forge a coalition without the @entity141 or @entity144 , but relying on the support of smaller parties			0
almost a third ( 31 per cent ) think the @entity4 could plough ahead as a minority government			2
just 24 per cent support the introduction of gay marriage , while 59 per cent are opposed			0
the coalition policy to protect the overseas aid budget from spending cuts is also opposed by 67 per cent of party members , compared to just 18 per cent who back it			1
only seven per cent of those surveyed thought the party leadership ' respects them a lot ' , while 42 per cent feel it ' does not respect them very much ' and 11 per cent said it ' does not respect them at all '			0
more than two in five ( 44 per cent ) say they spend no time at all on campaign activity , while 30 per cent say they give up to five hours a month for leafleting , social events and meetings			0
almost 40 per cent say they are now less active within the party than five years ago			0
the polling was carried out between may 31 and june 11 , and they were not able to weight the results to reflect the estimated 100,000 @entity4 members .			1

only a third of *grassroots* say they definitely would not back @entity5 in 2015
44 *%* of members say they do no campaigning for the party
study comes after row over @entity4 describing activists as ' swivel - eyed loons '
@entity28 's @entity5 predicted to win @entity187 vote in 2014
