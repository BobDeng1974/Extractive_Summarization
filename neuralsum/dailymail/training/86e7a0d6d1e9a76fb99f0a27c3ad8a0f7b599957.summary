@entity0 is in no doubt : stepping on to the @entity3 dancefloor is guaranteed to give you sweaty palms and a racing heart			1
‘ being on that dancefloor on saturday night in front of the studio audience is one of the most terrifying things i ’ve ever done , ’ she says			1
and it does n’t seem to get any easier			1
several weeks into the competition , and despite talking to weekend fresh from performing a beautifully executed waltz that won praise from the judges , she ’s still full of trepidation			1
‘ it was lovely to get some good comments but as soon as we go back to @entity21 i predict a dip			1
’ her anxiety is understandable : @entity26 presenter performed a distinctly underwhelming cha cha cha with her dance partner , @entity28 , on her first week on the show			1
golden couple : @entity26 co-hosts @entity32 , 33 , and @entity0 , 34 ‘ it was a disaster , ’ she says			1
‘ i was like a rabbit caught in headlights			1
i had to have a word with myself afterwards and say , “ @entity0 , get a grip			1
” ’ like many @entity3 competitors , the 34 - year - old is only just realising the extent to which @entity3 requires not only physical but also emotional dedication			1
‘ people warn you how tough it is , ’ she says			1
‘ @entity32 said , “ it ’ll take over your life			1
” but until you do it you have no idea how much			1
’ @entity32 , of course , is her 33 - year - old @entity26 co-host @entity32 , a graduate of the @entity3 class of 2010			1
he reached the final and is proving a sounding - board , advice guru and potential partner to practise with			1
it is , @entity0 says , ‘ only a matter of time ’ before he squires her around the @entity26 studio			1
in fact , watching her co-host go through his @entity3 paces last year was the main spur to taking part			1
‘ i always said if i was ever going to do that type of show , it ’d be @entity3			1
@entity32 ’s experience sealed the deal			1
i knew how much he ’d enjoyed it			1
i also thought , “ it ’s good for our show , for our relationship			1
” ’ ah yes , their relationship			1
it ’s nearly a year now since @entity32 joined @entity0 on @entity26 , after their predecessors @entity81 and @entity86 ’s muchpublicised ( some would say catastrophic ) move to @entity87 to launch @entity88			2
on screen chemistry : @entity32 and @entity0 on @entity26 the onscreen chemistry between @entity81 and @entity86 had set tongues wagging – though both denied an affair – and helped take @entity26 to great heights , attracting audiences of more than five million			2
by 2009 , however , viewing figures were dwindling , dropping below four million			2
a combined pay packet of £ 10million was too good to turn down , and @entity81 and @entity86 finally jumped ship to @entity87			2
for that sort of money , @entity87 must have been expecting tv gold – instead they got @entity88 , which is currently pulling in just 700,000 viewers , less than half the audience of its rival , @entity104			2
it has n’t all been plain sailing at @entity26 , either			2
when @entity0 , then a presenter on @entity110 channel @entity109 , was announced as the new female host she was dubbed a ‘ @entity112 ’ who lacked experience			1
her male co-presenter , @entity115 , meanwhile , resigned after just a few months after confessing to dubious online chats behind his wife ’s back , and was replaced by @entity119 and in september , more than 400 viewers complained about the behaviour of a dog trainer who appeared on the show , claiming he had been too aggressive towards a @entity124			2
but ratings these days are buoyant , averaging five million , and the @entity81 and @entity86 era seems a distant memory			2
‘ it ’s definitely been a rocky time but now it feels really secure , really solid , ’ says @entity0 adds , ‘ it seems to have just worked			2
and you ca n’t force that – if you try too hard it ’s just awful			2
we wanted it to come naturally , especially as in the past the show has had a turbulent ride			2
now it ’s , well , settled			2
’ so settled , in fact , that guests are often struck by how laid - back they are on set – it ’s been remarked that they come across like a happily married couple			2
‘ we ’re always chatting away so it ’d be quite easy for us to go on air without realising , ’ says @entity145 came on and he said , “ well , you two are incredibly relaxed ; you just seem to be making this up			2
” we ’re not but i guess it can appear like that			2
’ but for his part , he likes the show best when they ’re doing something gritty			0
‘ we did some stuff with the riots that i was really proud of , ’ he says			0
‘ we had a lot of victims who came on , we ’d gone out on to the street to find them and i ’d like to do more of that kind of reporting			0
’ @entity32 with @entity160 last year ( left ) and @entity0 with her @entity3 partner , @entity28 in the current @entity104 series ( right ) @entity32 is also doing his best to calm his co-host ’s nerves on the dancefloor			1
@entity0 admits she was left downhearted by her first performance , labelled ‘ starchy ’ by judge @entity168			0
‘ i felt a bit defeated before we got anywhere near the studio , ’ she admits			0
‘ i remember @entity28 saying , “ @entity174 my shoulder when you hear the strongest beat in the bar , ” at our first meeting , and i could n’t do it			0
he said , “ oh , @entity183 , ” and i thought , “ this is terrible			0
” later , @entity28 admitted he was horrified when he saw me dancing because he did n’t think i ’d be that bad			0
he said , “ just ask @entity32 – he ’ll show you how to do it			0
” ’ @entity32 certainly had natural flair , but he ’s so busy with a new challenge now that he has little time for dance coaching : as you read this he is in training for @entity193 – he ’s going to ride a rickshaw from @entity195 to @entity196 with a different passenger for each leg of the journey			0
today , he is sore after months in the saddle , yet still says , ‘ i probably have n’t done enough preparation			0
’ at least he ’s not expected to do the cycling wearing little more than two tiny pieces of cloth held together by dental floss , like @entity3 ’s female competitors			1
‘ yes , i ’ve worn more coming out of the shower than i did on the launch show , i felt completely naked , ’ confesses @entity0			0
‘ but people like to see you being a bit different			0
’ she ’s only worried about impressing one man , anyway – a chap she ’ll name only as @entity215 , who she met through a friend and has been dating for the past five months			0
he ’s from @entity217 and was n’t aware of @entity26 when we met			0
it ’s going well , but he has nothing to do with the media , so i do n’t want to say too much , to save him embarrassment with his friends and colleagues			0
’ you can understand her caution , having already seen the break - up of two long - term relationships , both with television types : shortly before she started on @entity26 in august last year , her relationship with her boyfriend of seven years , presenter @entity224 , ended , while before that she had dated @entity232 , front man on the @entity233 , for three years			0
it ca n’t be easy , of course , watching your beloved entwined with someone else			0
some of the moves in @entity3 are so steamy they should be x-rated			1
‘ i do n’t envy anybody ’s partner , ’ @entity0 admits			0
‘ but @entity215 said to me , “ if i even have a hint that you ’re worrying about what i think , i ’ll be really annoyed			0
” ’ @entity32 had the same conversation with his physiotherapist wife @entity247 , 33 , mother of his two children , @entity250 , four , and two - year - old @entity251			0
‘ @entity247 was brilliant , ’ he says			0
‘ she said at the start , “ if you ’re not going to give it everything , do n’t bother doing it at all			0
” ’ @entity0 describes reporting for her @entity26 duties each evening following @entity3 rehearsals as ‘ like putting on a comfy pair of shoes			1
at the moment it ’s a lovely contrast			0
’ the word ‘ contrast ’ is just the prompt her co-host needs for a spot of mickey - taking			1
‘ when you take part in @entity3 , you get more and more tanned as the weeks go by			1
so i ’ve asked the producers to introduce a split - screen format , ’ he says			0
‘ that way we can just lower the contrast slightly on @entity276 , for equilibrium			0
’ equilibrium , of course , being a cherished asset on @entity26 these days – one that its presenters are , no doubt , praying will last			0
@entity32 starts @entity282 for @entity193 on 11 november			0
