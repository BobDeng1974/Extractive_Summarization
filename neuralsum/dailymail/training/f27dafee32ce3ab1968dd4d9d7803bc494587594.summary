the last meal of a new species of marine reptile that lived in the seas during the time of the dinosaurs has been found preserved in a forgotten fossil stored at a museum			1
a palaeontologist discovered the 189 - million - year - old ichthyosaur while looking through the collections at @entity11			1
the five foot ( 1.5 metres ) long fossil , which was thought to be a plaster copy , had been kept in storage for nearly 30 years and had been largely overlooked			1
the fossilised , which has been named @entity16 , had lain forgotten about in @entity11 for nearly 30 years			1
the dark mass between the ribs are the remains of the animals last meal however , @entity22 , a visting scientist at the @entity23 , noticed some unusual structures in the bone structure while browsing the museum 's collection			1
skin pigments preserved in fossils - including an extinct creature that swam the oceans almost 200 million years ago - have been revealed using x-rays			2
scans of the beautifully - preserved marine organisms help paint a picture of the appearance of animals that died out millions of years ago			0
dark traces on fossilised skin from three reptiles - a 55 million - year - old leatherback turtle , an 86 - million - year - old mosasaur and a 190 to 196 - million - year - old ichthyosaur dating back up to 196 million years - were found to contain melanin			1
this pigment is found in many animals and serves various roles , from camouflage to regulation of body temperature			0
it suggests the ichthyosaurs had dark skins much like some species of modern dolphin			0
dr @entity56 and colleagues at @entity58 , in @entity59 , who conducted the study said evidence of it in these creatures reflects the important evolutionary role melanin played			0
they said the pigment was crucial in determining whether such animals were able to live in the colder parts of the world			0
trapped within the fossilised bones of the ancient reptile , which had a similar shape to modern day dolphins , were also the remains of its last meal - squid			1
the finding has shed new light on the diets that these ocean dwelling reptiles lived on and gives new insight into their behaviour			2
@entity83 spend most of their time in the cold , dark depths of the ocean and most modern species that feed on them tend to dive down hundreds of metres to reach them			0
according to scientists this suggests that ichthyosaurs may have also been capable of withstanding high pressure and cold temperatures to reach their food			0
working with palaeontologists at the @entity99 , mr @entity22 has now identified the fossil as a new species that was previously unknown to science			1
it has been named @entity16 in honor of the @entity106 fossil collector @entity105 , who first collected ichtyosaurs in the early 1800s			1
mr @entity22 said : ' it has taken us seven years of comparing this fossil with other ichthyosaur specimens from around the world to establish that it is a new species			1
' finding the contents of the stomach inside were an added bonus			0
most fossils of ichthyosaurs have had their gut contents removed , if there were there , when they were excavated in the early 1800s to make them more aesthetically pleasing			0
' in this fossil , however , there is a mass of thousands of tiny hooks - the ends of squid tentacles			1
we also found a fish scale close to the gut mass too , which could also have been the remains of a meal , although it may have just ended up inside the fossil by accident			2
' the artists impression above shows how @entity138 may have looked 189 million years ago the fossil was found between @entity140 , near @entity141 , and @entity142 on the @entity143 in the 1980s the sharp teeth of @entity16 shown above would have allowed it to snatch squid as it swam the fossil is the first new species of ichthyosaur to be discovered in around 130 years and is one of the most complete specimens of its age			1
it was originally found among the rocks somewhere between @entity140 , near @entity141 , and @entity156 on the @entity157 of @entity143 during the 1980s and bought by @entity11 in 1983			1
however , after some staff changes at the museum it was later mistakenly labelled as a plaster cast copy and left to languish in the museums collections			2
however , in 2008 mr @entity22 noticed that some of the fin bones appeared to be different from other species of ichthyosaurs he had seen			2
working with professor @entity167 from the @entity99 , they compared the fossilised bones with around 1,000 other ichthyosaur remains			0
their findings are published in the @entity172			0
in their paper they describe the fossil as a new species and say it lived in the oceans between 189 and 182 million years ago during the early @entity157 period			1
@entity22 , pictured above , discovered the new species while browsing the collection at @entity11 the scientists discovered tiny hooks from the end of squid tenticles fossilised in the remains of the reptile during their search they discovered three other specimens in museums elsewhere in the world that they believe are also of the same species as the fossil in @entity11			1
they were also able to determine that the fossil in @entity11 , which is almost complete apart from the end of its tail , belonged to an adult male			2
the other specimens are thought to be a subadult and two juveniles			0
mr @entity22 said he thought it was the first time it had been possible to determine the sex of fossilised ichthyosaurs			2
@entity22 and fellow palaeontologist @entity207 examine the new species of ichthyosaur above ichthyosaurs are an ancient species of marine reptile that are distantly related to turtles as shown above he said : ' there appears to have been some sexual dimorphism as the humerus bones appear to be different			1
we examined dimorphism in other reptiles and found this often differs significantly			0
' we were able to say the fossil in @entity11 is probably a male adult			2
' ichthyosaurs were once common in the world 's oceans and had sharped teeth with which they are thought to have used to snatch fish as they hunted			0
some fossils have been found with the remains of fish preserved inside them			2
it is hoped the discovery will encourage other museums to look back through their collections as there could be other new species hidden there			0
dr @entity239 from @entity240 told the @entity241 : ' collections are treasures that show their value each time we 're able to look at them with a different perspective , and by asking new scientific questions			0
' palaeontologist @entity207 ( above ) helped prepare the fossil so its features could be examined more clearly			0

palaeontologist @entity22 found fossil in storage at @entity11
it was thought to be a plaster cast of ichthyosaur found on @entity157
he found it was a real fossil and a species previously unknown to science
the 189 million - year - old reptile has been named @entity16 -
it is was about 5 feet long and is thought to have looked similar to dolphins
preserved in the fossil 's gut were *undigested* remains of squid tentacles
the findings has provided insight into how these reptiles ate and lived
