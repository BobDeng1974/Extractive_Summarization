@entity39 : @entity6 want the return of the country 's spiritual leader , @entity43 at around 2.15pm they walked out of the hotel towards the temple and made a traditional victory call before setting themselves on fire			1
there have been at least 34 self - immolations since march of last year to draw attention to @entity10 's restrictions on @entity53 and to call for the return from exile of the @entity6 spiritual leader , the @entity43			1
most have taken place in heavily @entity6 areas of @entity10 , but only one had occurred in @entity30 itself and none in the capital			1
protests have become rare in remote @entity30 and @entity7 in particular because of tight police security that has blanketed the area since anti-government riots erupted in @entity7 in 2008			2
the latest incident occurred in the open - air barkhor market near the temple in the center of @entity7 , an area popular with @entity6 and tourists alike			2
@entity72 reported on monday that @entity7 was under heavy police and paramilitary guard following the immolations and that the situation was very tense			0
@entity10 's official news agency @entity77 blamed the protests on separatists and said the incidents were handled quickly and order restored			0

protest : the men ' self - immolated ' outside the @entity27 in @entity7 , one of @entity30 's holiest buildings @entity10 says @entity30 has always been part of its territory			0
@entity6 say the @entity109 region was virtually independent for centuries he said it reflects the fact that anger against @entity10 rule is not restricted to the areas where most of the self - immolations have occurred - mostly ethnically @entity6 areas outside the legal boundaries of @entity30			2
' all over @entity30 it 's the same emotion , it 's the same response ' to @entity123 's policies , he said			0
' we are always in fear of the next self - immolation , and whenever it happens we say prayers			0
and every time it happens we hope the world is listening			0

a @entity6 man self - immolates at a protest in @entity102 in march @entity10 says @entity30 has always been part of its territory , but many @entity6 say the @entity109 region was virtually independent for centuries until @entity10 troops invaded in the 1950s			1
@entity123 blames the exiled @entity6 spiritual leader , the @entity43 , for fanning anti-government sentiment and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries , where support for the @entity43 and @entity6 independence runs high			2

the centuries - long tradition has become a type of radical political protest and more than 500 have been reported in @entity167 media since the 1960s			0
