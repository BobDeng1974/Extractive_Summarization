@entity8 , which supplies more than 3.5million homes in @entity10 and the @entity11 , will face a deficit of 125million litres a day by the end of the decade if no action is taken			1
that is roughly equivalent to the amount needed for a million baths			0
as well as reducing leakage and wastage , and introducing more water meters , the company is now asking customers for their views on drinking recycled toilet water			1
reusing waste water is common in drier climates such as @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity30 , but a relatively untested technology in @entity32			2
it involves putting treated effluent from a sewage works back into a river upstream of a water treatment plant			0
the diluted waste is then treated to drinking quality standards before being supplied to customers			1
with @entity10 ’s population continuing to grow , its ageing utilities are struggling to keep up with demand			2
by 2040 , @entity8 will have a 16 per cent deficit if it does not boost its output – leaving 2.2million people short of water			1
recycling sewage into drinking water is being considered to meet shortfalls from 2025 , with the most likely site in east @entity10 , under the firm ’s draft resources plan for 2015 to 2040			1
currently , @entity8 is investigating recycling used household water – including effluent from dishwashers , washing machines , baths and toilets – at a plant in @entity62 , north @entity10			1
none of the water is being put back into supply			0
the company said the claim that water drunk in the capital has already gone through the human body seven times is a myth			0
recycling sewage into drinking water is being considered to meet shortfalls from 2025 , with the most likely site in east @entity10 , under @entity8 's draft resources plan for 2015 to 2040 by 2040 , @entity8 will have a 16 per cent deficit if it does not boost its output - leaving 2.2million people short of water but it did admit that a small amount of today ’s drinking water could come from waste , with treated sewage from locations such as @entity83 and @entity84 discharged into the @entity85 before being purified at downriver plants and pumped to residents in @entity10			1
the fact that consumers have already been drinking reused water may help convince them not to reject the method			2
@entity8 said : ‘ after 2025 we are likely to require a major new source of water			1
' on the basis of what we know now , this would be either a large new reservoir or a major water transfer scheme from elsewhere in the country or significant reuse of waste water			0
‘ the purpose of the consultation is to explain the pros and cons of all these options to our customers and seek their views			2
’ most utilities get their supplies from two major sources , rivers or groundwater – the latter tends to be cleaner			0
after being passed through grilles to remove large items of debris , the water is pumped into plants where chemicals are added to help remove finer particles such as mud and silt			0
it is then passed through a fine filter , often a bed of sand which contains micro- organisms that provide additional cleaning by breaking down any organic compounds			0
the water is then aerated to remove pesticides and any remaining organic compounds , helping to achieve a more neutral taste			0
in the final stage , chlorine is added as a disinfectant before the water is supplied to the consumer .			0

@entity8 supplies 3.5million homes in @entity10 and @entity11
it will face a deficit of 125million litres a day in 10 years if no action is taken
customers will be asked for their views on drinking recycled toilet water
