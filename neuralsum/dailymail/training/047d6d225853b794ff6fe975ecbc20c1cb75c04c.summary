@entity0 refused permission for @entity3 producers to even mention his agency by name after he was passed a memo on @entity7 nowadays @entity3 is a household name that everyone , from designer brands to luxury car makers , wants to be associated with			1
but back in 1964 - just two years after the @entity13 - the @entity12 reacted with horror after learning of plans to feature the @entity12 in upcoming @entity3 flick @entity7			1
@entity0 refused filmakers permission to even mention his agency by name after being passed a memo explaining that @entity3 was a @entity21 spy who had ' beautiful women presenting themselves to him in scanty attire '			0
newly released @entity12 files show that the movie was brought to the attention of the @entity12 after producer @entity28 requested the use of military aircraft during filming			1
the request prompted the @entity12 , which was still on high alert after years of @entity34 tensions , to run background checks on @entity28 , author @entity36 , and screenplay writer @entity37			1
while the reports seem to have got some information spot on - referring to @entity36 's novels as being filled with ' sex and bizarre situations ' - in other places the intelligence was sadly lacking			1
for example , the character of @entity46 is described as ' a fictional @entity12 agent ' , while any true @entity3 fan will know he in fact works for the @entity51			2
the reports , which were revealed by the @entity53 , also wrongly name actor @entity54 as the man playing @entity46 , when in fact he was replaced by @entity57 in @entity7			0
and , in a spectacular rewrite of the ending , the report claims that @entity7 's attempted robbery of @entity62 is solved by the @entity12 themselves , when in fact @entity3 foils the dastardly plot			1
the @entity12 were clearly not impressed with what they found , writing that @entity36 's book was ' not the type where we would want any mention of the @entity12 or a portrayal of @entity12 agents , no matter how favorable they might look in the movie			0
' @entity36 's stories generally center around sex and bizarre situations and , certainly , are not the type with which we want to be associated			2
' after reading the reports , @entity0 responded that agents speaking to @entity28 should ' forcibly bring to his attention ' a law ' which prohibits the use of the words " @entity12 " or any of its written initials without my written permission			2
' the documents also contain wrong information about previous @entity3 films , including @entity89 which is repeatedly referred to as ' for @entity90 with @entity91 ' , and is said to contain ' sex and excessive nudity			0
' the memos also reveal that 1964 was not the first time @entity36 's books had been brought to the attention of intelligence agents , after the author mentioned the @entity12 on several occasions			0
but they also got the ending of the film wrong , claiming the @entity12 foils @entity7 's plot the memo reads : ' all of these references have been favourable in the past			1
his stories are generally filled with beautiful women presenting themselves to him in scanty attire			0
' it was reported in @entity116 in august 1962 that president @entity117 was one of his most avid readers			0
' but despite the favourable references and presidential endorsement , @entity0 ordered his agents to contact @entity28 and ' vigorously protest any mention of @entity12 or portrayal of its agents in his proposed movie			2
' behind - the - scenes details about the production are also unearthed in the secret files , including the fact that film company @entity131 paid $ 300,000 fro the script , and planned to spend $ 3million making it .			0

producer @entity28 sent @entity12 request to use military planes in film
*letter* prompted agency to run checks on everything to do with @entity3
' sex and bizarre situations ' in novels meant @entity12 did not want to be involved
reports also claimed @entity7 's plot foiled by @entity12 , rather than @entity3
