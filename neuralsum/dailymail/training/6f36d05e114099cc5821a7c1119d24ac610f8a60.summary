@entity0 can afford himself a smug smile of satisfaction knowing that right now he can confidently claim that four of the @entity5 's best five goalkeepers on current form are @entity7			1
it must be years since any @entity10 manager could have looked at the top flight and been able to make that boast			2
unfortunately the best is n't available to @entity0 , but remarkably he is n't a regular for his own national team			0
here 's my top five in reverse order : @entity10 goalkeepers ( from left to right ) @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity22 train at @entity23 5 @entity24 ( @entity25 ) – he has made some outstanding stops for @entity27 this season and has reduced the errors that used to raise so many doubts about his ability at the very top level			1
he 's unfortunate to be returning to such good form at a time when @entity10 already have three goalkeepers unlikely to lose their place in the squad any time soon , injuries permitting			1
@entity25 are bottom of the league but that 's not because of @entity24 , who 's been excellent			2
@entity24 jumps to gather the ball under pressure during @entity25 's defeat at @entity46 on saturday 4 @entity20 ( @entity47 ) – far from the perfect keeper , indeed he sometimes makes me look technically gifted when the ball is at his feet			1
but for breathtaking shot - stopping there are few better			0
his tip over from @entity53 against @entity46 at @entity54 earlier this month was the best save of the season so far in my opinion			2
@entity47 goalkeeper @entity20 dives to make a save during his side 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity61 3 @entity19 ( @entity62 ) – he 's the clean - sheet king but that is n't always because the goalkeeper is brilliant			1
however , in this case , closer inspection of the action shows @entity19 has made a huge contribution to @entity62 's success this season			1
a big , commanding presence was something @entity62 needed and his confidence is infectious – as is the case with most keepers			0
an eyebrow - raising price tag has n't affected him and although he is capable of calamity – he was at fault for @entity81 's goal on monday night - there are definitely strengths in his game that contribute more to his growing reputation			0
@entity19 made a mistake against @entity81 but he has been key for @entity62 this season 2 @entity22 ( @entity87 ) – it 's only when you watch @entity22 live at a match that you fully appreciate what he brings			1
he 's a leader , he has presence in the box , and he is confident and assertive in his decision - making			0
when people barked and ranted about his ' mistake ' against @entity98 earlier this season at the @entity100 , it was because he is normally so good in one - on - one situations			0
i watched him on saturday and with a less - than - rock - solid defence in front of him @entity22 made himself big and hard to beat several times in the second half with @entity109 looking for an equaliser			2
his form for @entity10 has been excellent this season as well			2
is he fault - free ? no , but then not many are and that 's what he is aiming for i 'm sure			0
his confidence is sometimes interpreted as cockiness which is why some do n't like him			0
i prefer to judge him on his goalkeeping			0
is he the best in the @entity5 ? no , but he 's not far off			1
@entity87 goalkeeper @entity22 dives to punch the ball clear against @entity109 on saturday 1 @entity120 ( @entity121 ) – he 's gone from blunder - full to wonderful in his time at @entity124			1
he is now virtually a one - man defence for @entity121 – and boy have they needed him this season			1
his masterclass against @entity129 earlier this season was stunning , and his save from @entity131 at @entity132 on saturday was one of the best we 've seen in this campaign			0
surely it 's only a matter of time before he takes over from @entity138 for @entity139			0
and maybe even for @entity140			0
of course there will be fans reading this and crying that their keeper is n't acknowledged ( obviously not @entity146 fans )			0
@entity121 goalkeeper @entity120 ( right ) pulls off a fine save in his side 's 2 - 1 win against @entity132 @entity149 , pictured at the @entity150 , has been in outstanding form for @entity153 's side this season @entity154 of @entity155 is particularly unfortunate not to make the top five			1
@entity157 is capable of the spectacular for @entity81 – witness his display in the goalless draw at @entity160			0
@entity61 's @entity161 is an excellent keeper but he has so little to do at the moment it 's hard to judge him			1
@entity165 at @entity109 and @entity167 's @entity166 have also surprised me with their level of performance this season as well			2
there are some good keepers around the @entity5 that 's for sure and quite a few of them are @entity7 .			1

four of the @entity5 's top five goalkeepers are @entity7
@entity22 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity178 are all in form
but @entity121 's @entity120 has been superb this season
@entity161 and @entity154 *unlucky* not to make top five
