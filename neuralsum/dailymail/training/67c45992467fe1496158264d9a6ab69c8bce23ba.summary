by @entity0 it has been touted as the future of computing , the next revolution in technology , and also been barred from many establishments before it even goes on sale			1
however , until now , it has not been clear exactly how @entity9 , the search giant 's eyewear , actually works			1
luckily , a designer has taken it upon himself to create an infographic showing exactly how @entity14 manages to project an image into a user 's view			1
how @entity9 works : a @entity19 designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image the infographic also reveals how @entity9 is focused so the image always appears sharp ' depending on how you wear the @entity9 , the layer appears in the upper right corner or in the middle of the visual field , ' says @entity29			1
' when the @entity9 is high on the nose , so that you can practically see through underneath , you must turn the eye up to view the image sharp			1
' because the prism is semi-transparent you can also place it directly in front of the pupil			2
in that case , you have the sharp layer directly in front of the eyes			2
' @entity29 , a @entity19 designer , said he created the graphic to show people how the @entity14 system works			1
' @entity9 is a technical masterpiece , ' he said			2
' it combines numerous functions and features in a very small unit			2
in addition to phone and camera ( photo , video ) , it offers internet connection , including gps			2
' glass is set to go on sale later this year , although will initially be limited to developers and selected members of the public			0
it is expected to cost under Â £ 1,000 when it becomes widely available			0
' the core feature of @entity9 is a visual layer that is placed over the reality ( ' augmented reality ' ) , explains @entity29 ' this layer opens a door to amazing new possibilities			1
' in the @entity9 contains a mini-projector , which projected the layer via a clever , semi-transparent prism directly on the retina in the eye			0
' because of this the image , even though it is so close to the eye , is sharp and clear			0
' you can move the front part of the @entity9 easily to optimize the focus			0
' @entity14 has so far only released limited video footage of how @entity9 will actually look augmented reality : this demonstration shows off navigation information similar to what @entity14 currently offers via its @entity87 service wearing glasses and using glass could be impossible , warns @entity90 @entity90 also warns those wearing glasses with prescription lenses may struggle			1
@entity14 co-founder @entity93 demonstrating @entity14 's new glass - but the firm has so far refused to reveal exactly how it works ' the biggest challenge for @entity14 will now be to make the @entity9 also usable for people with normal glasses ( to compensate for a low vision )			1
' in this case the @entity9 has to be placed ahead of normal glasses - which does n't look and feel well or like a glass			0
' or @entity14 has to manufacture individual customized prisms , but this would be considerably more expensive than the standard production			1
it comes as it emerged people wearing @entity9 eyewear could be banned from strip clubs , cinemas and casinos because their owners donâ € ™ t want them filming there			0
bosses for establishments in the @entity115 said that due to privacy concerns they would be asking anyone wearing the glasses to remove them or they wonâ € ™ t be let in			0
lap dance clubs said that they would treat @entity9 wearers the same as anyone caught filming a stripper - and would kick them out			0
@entity115 technology guru @entity123 predicts wearable devices like @entity9 ( pictured ) will be expensive as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by phone companies and consumers will have to upgrade their data plans t is believed @entity9 ( pictured ) will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity but it could also spark an increase in the cost of data plans - possibly for all consumers even if they are not taking advantage of the new technology			0

@entity14 has refused to reveal the internals of its system , or show exactly how it will work
@entity19 designer @entity29 created a graphic explaining the system
