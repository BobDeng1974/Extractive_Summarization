by @entity0 as a byword for barbarity , @entity1 has come down to us 800 years later as the cruellest conqueror of all time			1
we preserve his name to compare the perpetrators of genocide today to him			2
is this tradition justified ? that is what a new biographer should tell us and this one , @entity14 , has every qualification			2
he even speaks @entity16 and makes @entity17 his stamping ground			2
he has written a very lively and enjoyable book on a very complex and baffling story			2
it is littered with names that you have never heard of and can not pronounce , and the two you do know are not as you thought : @entity1 starts a soft g — @entity25 — and his grandson was @entity27 , not @entity28 as @entity29 had it			1
barbaric : @entity1 's name has lived on for 800 years because of the mass killings that took place under his command the first chapters tell how a poor , illiterate boy , originally called @entity1 , got himself recognised as leader of the hitherto disunited @entity16			1
this near - pagan lad had one great conviction : that @entity40 , the @entity16 deity , had decreed that he was to conquer all the land in every direction			1
why he believed this is a mystery			1
he set about it and every victory which he and his horsemen achieved confirmed his belief that @entity49 was on his side			1
in 1189 the @entity16 decided he should have a new name : @entity1			1
it was unique and until recently no one could explain where it came from			2
now , however , scholars believe it derives from an obsolete @entity58 word , chingis , meaning ‘ fierce , hard , tough ’			1
the @entity16 took naturally to the idea that they were the master race			2
under @entity1 — the @entity62 — their empire swelled like a pregnant pig , swallowing up most of central @entity65 from the @entity66 in the west to the @entity68 in the east , and taking in the great cities of the @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
in the spring of 1211 , he gathered an army some 100,000 strong and advanced across the @entity76 to conquer the @entity78 empire of @entity79			1
the men took 300,000 horses and were armed with catapults which could lob rocks or firebombs 100 metres			2
great empire : under @entity1 's reign of terror the @entity86 encompassed most of @entity65 behind this came herds of mares to provide the warriors with horse milk			1
often this mass migration incorporated wives , families and sheep			2
the whole juggernaut probably ran to 250,000 with a million animals in tow			1
when they reached a fortified city their strategy was to surround it , starve it and invite its leaders to surrender or be annihilated			2
those that refused were slaughtered to the last man , woman or child , but the same thing might easily happen to those which capitulated			2
@entity115 was the @entity16 ’ weapon — shock and awe			2
in 1219 he led his army westwards from @entity78 towards the ancient cities of @entity73 and @entity72 , the eastern outposts of @entity122 , which had a degree of civilisation undreamed of on the @entity16 steppes			2
there they lay with domes , palaces , mosques , huge libraries and scores of scholars leading the rest of the world in maths , science , astronomy and general knowledge			2
@entity72 was stripped of its treasures , bombarded and burned until all the males ‘ who stood higher than the butt of a whip ’ had been killed			1
the @entity147 juggernaut rolled on towards @entity73 , defended by some 100,000 troops and 20 elephants , which panicked , trampled their drivers and made off into the plains			2
when the city ’s merchant leaders and senior clergy invited the @entity16 in , they looted their treasures , their wives and helped themselves to such survivors as would make slaves			2
they moved on to lay siege to the remaining great city , @entity163			0
by the time victory came , five months later , the invaders ‘ were in no mood for mercy ’			0
the figures recorded by @entity170 historians are staggering : 50,000 soldiers killed 24 men each			1
there were 40 sacrificial virgins slaughtered at @entity1 's funeral @entity1 now turned his attention to @entity177 , an oasis city of mosques and mansions			1
its ten libraries contained 150,000 volumes , the greatest collection in @entity65			1
the @entity16 entered the city and after separating 400 craftsmen and a crowd of children to act as slaves , drove the remaining population on to the plain			0
‘ then , ’ writes man , ‘ the killing started			0
the place was ransacked , the buildings mined , the books burned or buried			0
@entity177 lost almost everything and almost everyone			0
’ the @entity16 ordered that no woman , man or child be spared			0
each soldier in the 7,000 - strong army was allotted around 300 people to kill			1
most had their throats slit			0
others were led out , 20 at a time , to be drowned in a trough of blood			0
you might have thought even the most hard - hearted troops would baulk at having to slit the throats of so many victims , but it does n’t seem to have troubled the @entity16 who would have despatched them , says man , as easily as sheep			1
merciless : some historians estimate that as many as four million people were killed by @entity1 's soldiers the fearsome leader remembered : a 16ft @entity1 statue in @entity223 , @entity224 he points out that it takes only seconds to slit a throat , and that for 7,000 soldiers ‘ the slaughter of a million would have been an easy two hours ’ work ’			1
in the late 18th century the @entity232 historian @entity231 placed the total slaughter at more than four million			1
the figure may be exaggerated , but it was certainly one of the biggest mass killings in history			0
@entity1 then returned to northern @entity78 , which he had only partially conquered			1
by the second week of august 1227 he was on the verge of achieving an empire running from the @entity241 almost to @entity242			0
it was not to be			0
he became seriously ill — possibly with typhus — and just days later was dead			0
but not before having told his leading captives : ‘ i am the punishment of @entity49			1
if you had not committed great sins , @entity49 would not have sent me as your punishment ’			1
throat slitter supreme : @entity1 , whose real name was @entity1 , was named @entity1 by his troops because of his fierce personality his body was secretly taken back thousands of miles to @entity17 , where it was buried somewhere unknown on a sacred mountain			1
today , a massive mausoleum shows its visitors colossal statues of him — but no body			0
they are still looking for it			0
did @entity1 achieve anything but the @entity267 record in bloodshed ? @entity14 believes he had redeeming features			1
he allowed toleration of all religions — perhaps because he did n’t have much of one himself , except as a mandate for conquest			0
he allowed women to play a more leading role than other dictators and he employed anyone of talent , irrespective of where they came from			0
he left no palaces , no writings , no philosophy , nothing but territories that owed allegiance to him			0
it is a relief to turn to his grandson , @entity27 , for the rest of the book			0
@entity27 had himself been recognised not only as the great @entity1 but as first emperor of a new @entity78 dynasty , the @entity293			1
he built his new capital , known as @entity295 , which was mistranslated by @entity29 in his opium - inspired poem , @entity296			0
@entity27 ’s normal palace there was called the @entity300 but for summer he built the pleasure dome that we all know			0
it was n’t much like @entity29 ’s dream			0
the sunny pleasure dome was not made on caves of ice			0
it was made of bamboo rods laid in a circle and supported by carved wooden columns			0
one of his great innovations was paper money			0
he gave @entity78 a new legal system			0
he built pagodas and adopted @entity318			0
altogether he was a lenient dictator			0
he grew very fat ( the drink was to blame ) and died at the age of 80			0
at this point he ruled from the @entity322 in the west to the @entity68 in the east , covering a sixth of the world ’s known land mass. but within two years of his death this empire had split into its component parts , according to nationality			1
the @entity86 had vanished , leaving a legacy to the world of precisely nothing .			1

@entity1 has been a byword for barbarity for the last 800 years
some historians estimate four million people were killed under his orders
as a boy @entity1 believed @entity49 had decreed he should conquer the land
the name @entity1 means ' fierce , hard , tough '
during @entity1 's reign of terror the @entity86 took up most of @entity65
