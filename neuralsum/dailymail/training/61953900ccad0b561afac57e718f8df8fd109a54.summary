@entity8 , seven , died at her home in @entity10 , @entity11 , in april 2009 , from an asthma attack brought on by a cardiac arrest @entity7 said she had felt partially responsible for not knowing how to perform emergency first aid on her dying daughter the paramedic was struck off in 2010 after the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) heard about @entity8 's case and other , separate incidents - including one in which he ' behaved without compassion , feeling or tact towards the patient and his family '			1
mrs @entity8 told @entity34 : ' it 's morally wrong , if nothing else			1
' they should have informed me			0
they should have informed the police as far as i 'm concerned			0
it 's my child , not theirs			2
to them she 's just a piece of paperwork			2
' papers from the @entity25 about mr @entity17 's case do not mention @entity8 's name			1
they show how mr @entity17 did not perform advanced life support and that he pronounced the patient dead after only performing basic life support			0
a technician on a second ambulance wanted to take the little girl to hospital , which he said would have ' given the family some support ' but was overruled by mr @entity17			0
hush - up : paramedic @entity17 who drove a @entity59 similar to the one pictured , was found to have ' behaved without compassion ' experts have said , though , that the chances were that @entity8 was unlikely to have survived even if these actions had been taken			1
denials : @entity66 said there had been no policy of keeping any information from the @entity8 family mr @entity17 was only brought before the @entity25 after an audit of the documentation			1
a spokeswoman for @entity74 , which is part of @entity76 , said : ' it has not been , and is not , our intention to keep information from the family concerned and we would like to reassure them and members of the public that we are committed to being open with patients and their relatives			0
' we understand the additional distress raising this again will cause the patient 's family and we would be willing to meet with them and discuss any concerns they may have			0
' an @entity25 spokeswoman said the council ' operates transparent and open fitness to practise processes ' and stressed its hearings are held in public and are well advertised in advance			1
@entity99 , @entity25 director of fitness to practise , said : ' it is often the case that it is the employer of the registrant that raises the concern			1
tragedy : a technician on a second ambulance wanted to take @entity8 to hospital , which he said would have ' given the family some support ' but was overruled by mr @entity17			2
pictured , her home town of @entity10 , @entity11 ' in cases such as these , we are not always informed of the identity of the patients involved			0
' the @entity25 has a statutory responsibility to liaise with the complainant ( s ) whether it is an individual or employer and is committed to ensuring that they are kept up to date with the progress of our investigation			2
' often family members , who are not complainants , are not required to provide evidence at hearings ; however , we are taking steps to ensure that they are informed of the hearing by the employer where appropriate			0
' the case is one of a number uncovered by a @entity34 investigation in which relatives have not been told about paramedics being disciplined after treating members of their families .			0
