southern states have long been seen as the unhealthiest in the nation @entity2 and @entity3 regularly top the list as the ' fattest states in @entity6 ' new study shows that there 's a difference between recorded weights taken over the phone compared to those in - person tables are turned with ' truthful ' southerners found to be less obese that their northern cousins with some of @entity6 's tastiest , yet unhealthiest food , it 's no wonder that for years , many have deemed people from the @entity21 to be amongst the fattest in the nation			1
whether its because so much of the food is fried or simply because access to healthy food and vegetables is hard to come by , or because southerners do n't do much exercise - the stereotype seems to have stuck			2
but a new study from the @entity30 in @entity31 says that the @entity21 is not as fat as the rest of the world would have us believe			2
epidemic : rising levels of obesity is a major problem sweeping the @entity6 the journal @entity39 , says that there â€™s a higher concentration of obese people in the @entity44 states of @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
the northern region of the country appears to have about 41 per cent obesity compared to 31 per cent in the southern states of @entity2 and @entity3			1
just two years ago , the @entity52 claimed the two states were the fattest in the @entity6			1
@entity21 definitely enjoy their fried chicken ( not to mention fried steak , fried onions , fried green tomatoes , fried pickles and fried corn bread ) but the northerners of states like @entity62 and @entity63 enjoy their fried cheese curds and deep dish pizzas			0
i 'll have fries with that : or maybe just fries on their own ? the southern states are notorious for the unhealthy eating habits shocking : there are now 12 states where obesity levels are at 30 per cent or more the region famous for its biscuits , barbecue and pecan pies has been struggling with its weight for years			1
so what are the reasons for this gut - busting turnaround ? the journal believes that truth - telling has something to do with it			0
the @entity39 journal believes those who took part in the @entity52 telephone survey in the @entity21 were simply more honest about their weight than those in the @entity47			0
the @entity30 conducted their survey in - person using actual recorded weights			1
change in the numbers : @entity3 and @entity2 found their obesity rate fall from 41 per cent to 31 per cent big statement : the report by the @entity30 found that southerners were less likely to lie about their weight when asked over the telephone they found the results to less than a similar survey which was carried out by the @entity52 over the phone			1
the @entity107 report suggests the results gathered by telephone may have been inaccurate with participants lying about the digits on their bathroom scales			0
in this latest survey , @entity3 was fourth and @entity2 was in the middle of the pack			2
truth be told : a study to measure obesity found that people who were asked their weight over the phone lied more if they were from the northern @entity6			1
@entity121 , professor in the @entity122 at @entity107 explained to al.com his theory on why the results are so different			0
' my speculation is that people in the @entity21 are telling the truth more			0
perhaps there is not as much stigma connected to obesity as say someone in @entity133 , or in this case , @entity45			0
the numbers shows the wide discrepancy between what people say on the telephone and the physical evidence of actually getting weighed			0
everybody under - reports their weight but women do it more whereas men over-report their height , which makes them seem less obese			2
