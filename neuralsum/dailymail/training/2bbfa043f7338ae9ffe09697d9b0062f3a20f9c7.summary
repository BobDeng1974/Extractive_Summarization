by @entity0 a paragliding pensioner was left dangling 60m above the ground for three hours when he collided with a cable car wire			1
too high to be reached by ladder , he eventually had to cut himself free and lower himself down under guidance from rescuers			2
the high drama played out in the @entity8 and began when 74 - year - old @entity9 was blown off course in strong winds and became entangled in the support wire of a cable car at @entity13 , a village in the canton of @entity16 in @entity17			1
perilous : @entity9 was blown off course in strong winds and became entangled in the support wire of a cable car at @entity13 extreme danger : mr @entity9 was too high up to be rescued by ladder happy ending : rescuers slid mr @entity9 a knife , rope and harness and in the end he was able to lower himself down he would have fallen to a certain death if his parachute had come free			1
fortunately , there was a happy ending , but it was agonisingly touch and go for a while			0
mountain rescue boss @entity34 said : ' @entity35 did manage to put up a rescue cushion but it was always touch and go whether it would actually catch the man if he fell			0
he managed to get a shoe free and throw that down and based on where that landed was where the cushion was positioned , but again with the wind and other factors it was still very risky			0
' soft landing : a huge rescue cushion was placed under mr @entity9 in case his parachute worked free firemen then managed to get the rescue vehicle below the hanging paraglider and put up a ladder but it fell short and so that plan had to be abandoned as well			2
in the end rescuers slid a radio , rope , harness and a very sharp knife along the wire to mr @entity9 in a small bag			1
they then talked him through putting the harness on and cutting himself free from the parachute so that he could rescue himself .			0
