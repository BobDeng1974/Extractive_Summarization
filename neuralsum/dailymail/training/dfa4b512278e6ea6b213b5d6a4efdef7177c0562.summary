by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 16:46 est , 10 march 2014 a new generation of ' super vegetables ' with far more nutrients that current plants could soon be on a table near you			1
originally designed as a way for astronauts to protect their eyesight in space , the research could lead to a boost for leafy vegetables on @entity15			1
the key to boosting nutrients was to flash plants with bright light			1
eat your super-veg : researchers believe they have found a way to boost the nutrients in leafy vegetables grown in space - and say the same technique could be used on @entity15 a lack of water can limit the plant ’s ability to use all the sunlight it ’s getting for photosynthesis			1
to keep the excess sunlight from damaging the plant ’s biochemical pathways , it produces zeaxanthin , a compound that helps safely remove excess light			2
@entity41 , which the human body can not produce on its own , plays a similar protective role in our eyes			0
while the study is published in an astronautics journal , experts says the findings are applicable on @entity15 as well and could be especially relevant for future research into plant - based human nutrition and urban food production , which must maximize plant growth in small areas			1
the findings also highlight the potential for investigating how to prod plants to express traits that are already written in their genetic codes either more fully or less fully			1
' learning more about what plants already ‘ know ’ how to do and trying to manipulate them through changing their environment rather than their genes could possibly be a really fruitful area of research , ' said undergraduate researcher @entity71 of the @entity72			1
the team found that exposing leafy vegetables grown during spaceflight to a few bright pulses of light daily could increase the amount of eye - protecting nutrients produced by the plants , according to a new study by researchers			1
one of the concerns for astronauts during future extended spaceflights will be the onslaught of eye - damaging radiation they ’ll be exposed to			1
but astronauts should be able to mitigate radiation - induced harm to their eyes by eating plants that contain carotenoids , especially zeaxanthin , which is known to promote eye health			1
@entity41 could be ingested as a supplement , but there is evidence that human bodies are better at absorbing carotenoids from whole foods , such as green leafy vegetables			0
the research could also help maximise the nutrition of vegetables grown in space on missions to planets such as @entity109			0
using the model plant species @entity111 , the team demonstrated that a few pulses of bright light on a daily basis spurred the plants to begin making zeaxanthin in preparation for an expected excess of sunlight			1
the pulses were short enough that they did n’t interfere with the otherwise optimal growing conditions , but long enough to cause accumulation of zeaxanthin			0
@entity111 is not a crop , but past research has shown that its behavior is a good indicator of what many edible plant species will do under similar circumstances			0
current research into space gardening tends to focus on getting the plants to grow as large as possible as quickly as possible by providing optimal light , water and fertilizer			2
however , this can impact the nutrients they hold			2
' there is a trade - off , ' said @entity142 , professor of distinction in the @entity144 and a co-author of the study published in the journal @entity148			0
' when we pamper plants in the field , they produce a lot of biomass but they are n’t very nutritious			2
' if they have to fend for themselves — if they have to defend themselves against pathogens or if there ’s a little bit of physical stress in the environment — plants make defense compounds that help them survive			2
' and those are the antioxidants that we need			0
' plants produce zeaxanthin when their leaves are absorbing more sunlight than they can use , which tends to happen when the plants are stressed			2
for example , a lack of water might limit the plant ’s ability to use all the sunlight it ’s getting for photosynthesis			0
to keep the excess sunlight from damaging the plant ’s biochemical pathways , it produces zeaxanthin , a compound that helps safely remove excess light			0
@entity41 , which the human body can not produce on its own , plays a similar protective role in our eyes			0
' our eyes are like a leaf — they are both about collecting light , ' @entity142 said			0
' we need the same protection to keep us safe from intense light			0

technique originally developed for astronauts
could also be used on @entity15 to create plants with more nutrients
flashing bright lights at plants found to be key
