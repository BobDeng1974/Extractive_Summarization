by @entity1 reporter published : 06:55 est , 6 january 2013 updated : 21:04 est , 6 january 2013 the head of the @entity3 is facing calls to resign over his role in one of the worst hospital scandals in history			1
sir @entity9 helped appoint the chief executive who presided over @entity11 at a time when up to 1,200 patients died through neglect			1
he is one of numerous executives who prospered despite their links to the scandal , described yesterday by health secretary @entity18 as a ‘ shocking betrayal of @entity3 founding values ’			1
scandal : a public inquiry will to recommend hospitals are fined or closed if they cover - up blunders in the wake of the tragedy at @entity11 , which was responsible for the deaths of up to 1,200 patients today sir @entity9 , who was appointed chief executive of the @entity3 in 2006 , earns more than £ 200,000 a year			1
between 400 and 1,200 patients are thought to have died at @entity31 from 2005 to 2008 , with some left so thirsty they were forced to drink water from vases next to their beds			1
later this month a report will call for sweeping changes to the @entity37 to ensure such a disaster can not happen again			1
it will describe a ‘ culture of fear ’ at @entity40 , which runs two hospitals , @entity42 and @entity43 , with managers more obsessed with meeting targets than protecting patients			1
in january 2006 sir @entity9 , at the time head of a regional health authority , was on a panel of @entity3 managers that interviewed mr @entity52 and appointed him as full - time chief executive of the trust			1
the decision was made even though mr @entity52 had no formal management training			1
he resigned in 2009 and received a reported £ 400,000 pay - off			2
but the career of sir @entity9 – a member of the @entity60 until 1983 – has blossomed			2
he was also recently appointed chief executive of the @entity62 , a new body that will oversee hospitals and gp services			2
although he is expected to be heavily criticised in the forthcoming report , it is unlikely that he will be sacked as he is such a powerful figure in the @entity37			2
@entity69 , 68 , ( left ) died of @entity70 at @entity31 after being left on filthy wards			2
@entity72 , 81 , ( right ) died after suffering severe bed sores but relatives of patients who died say he must resign or be sacked because his position is untenable			0
@entity78 , who helped expose @entity31 ’s failings following the death of her mother @entity81 and started the campaign group cure the @entity3 , said : ‘ our relatives suffered at the hands of these professionals			0
nobody spoke out and nobody was there to protect them			0
’ not a single nurse or doctor working at the hospital at the time has been struck off			0
the @entity1 understands that 37 nurses were referred to the @entity95 , but 25 were not deemed to have done wrong			0
another 11 are still having their cases considered by the watchdog , nearly five years later			0
one was handed a three - month suspension , but she was already planning to retire			0
while 41 doctors were referred to their regulator , the @entity102 , not one has yet been struck off			0
the failings at @entity40 emerged in march 2009 in a report by the @entity105 which described how sick and dying patients were ‘ routinely neglected ’ , ‘ inhumanely treated ’ and ‘ bullied ’			0
its findings prompted a public inquiry lasting two years , chaired by @entity110			1
he will present his findings later this month and is expected to call for sweeping changes to the @entity3 , including better regulation of managers and an overhaul of nurses ’ training .			0

probe into deaths at @entity11
public inquiry will say trust run under culture of fear , bullying and secrecy
