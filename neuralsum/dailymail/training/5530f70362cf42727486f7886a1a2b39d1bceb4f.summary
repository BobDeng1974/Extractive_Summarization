by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 12:11 est , 28 december 2012 a @entity2 family has adopted a four - year - old down syndrome girl from @entity4 , just before president @entity5 moved to ban @entity7 citizens bringing the country 's children to @entity7			1
@entity10 and @entity11 welcomed little @entity12 into their home on christmas eve after fighting for almost a year to get her here			2
but they will be among the last of more than 60,000 @entity7 families to bring up a @entity4 child as their own as @entity4 signed a bill today outlawing the process			1
@entity5 's approval of the adoption ban will leave nearly 50 @entity4 children on the verge of adoption by @entity7 families now stranded			1
the measure is retaliation for the @entity46 , legislation that calls for sanctions against @entity4 officials deemed human rights violators , after @entity4 imprisoned lawyer @entity50 , who later died , after uncovering a £ 143million fraud			2
the bill 's signing coincides with a @entity55 court acquitting the only official charged with his death			0
the @entity4 - language hashtag ' @entity58 ' was trending on @entity60 just minutes after @entity5 signed it			2
@entity62 estimates that there are about 740,000 children not in parental custody in @entity4 while about 18,000 @entity4 are on the waiting list to adopt a child			1
the law also blocks dozens of @entity4 children now being adopted by @entity7 families from leaving the country			1
siblings : @entity12 , 4 , pictured right with one of her new siblings , is settling in well to her new home in @entity76 , @entity2			2
critics say many other @entity4 children have been denied a similar future due to mr @entity5 's decision bittersweet : while being thrilled to have @entity12 , pictured right , the @entity81 's are heartbroken that @entity4 has finalized a ban on @entity7 adopting @entity4 children the @entity7 is the biggest destination for adopted @entity4 children - more than 60,000 of them have been taken in by @entity7 over the past two decades			1
the @entity87 says it regrets the @entity4 @entity89 's decision to pass the bill , saying it would prevent many children from growing up in families			1
@entity93 and @entity95 director @entity94 said : ' this bill is frankly a childish response to the @entity46			0
' the @entity97 should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen @entity4 civil society , not weaken it			2
' preempting criticism of the move , @entity5 promised measures to better care for his country 's orphans			0
' i intend to sign also a presidential decree that will modify the support mechanisms for orphaned children ... especially those who are in a difficult situation , by that i mean in poor health , ' @entity5 said			0
critics of the bill say the @entity4 authorities are playing political games with the lives of children			2
the @entity87 repeated its concerns over the measure			0
' since 1992 @entity7 families have welcomed more than 60,000 @entity4 children into their homes , and it is misguided to link the fate of children to unrelated political considerations , ' @entity87 spokesman @entity122 said in a statement			1
@entity131 : @entity4 president @entity5 , pictured , has signed a bill banning @entity7 from adopting @entity4 children that has raised tensions between @entity55 and @entity136 @entity122 added that the @entity7 was troubled by provisions in the bill that would restrict the ability of @entity4 civil society organizations to work with @entity7 partners			1
children in @entity4 's crowded and troubled orphanage system - particularly those with serious illnesses or disabilities - will have less of a chance of finding homes , and of even surviving , child rights advocates said			1
it took about 11 months for the @entity150 to bring @entity12 home from @entity4			1
she arrived at @entity152 at 11pm on @entity32			0
' it 's been tough , but worth it , and to have her here and be part of our family , it 's now great , ' @entity11 told the @entity160			0
' we feel like we 're complete and we 're excited to have her			0
' children with disabilities are placed into institutions when they turn five years old , and they are taken off a database of orphaned children , so it makes it almost impossible to find them a permanent home , the @entity150 said			0
at the institutions , the basic needs of the children are met , but they are given no education or attention , they said			0
they found @entity12 through a website that advocates for children with special needs called @entity179 ’s @entity178			2
according to the newspaper , she was the second girl they adopted from @entity4 with the help of the website			2
@entity184 , who is now 7 years old , was adopted in march 2011			0
nearly 50 children who were on the verge of being adopted by @entity7 are expected to stay in @entity4 despite the fact many of them have already been authorised by courts			1
' we know a lot of families who have already been to @entity4 and have met their children , ' @entity190 said			1
@entity196 concerns : the @entity87 said it had ' deep concerns ' about the welfare of more than 700,000 @entity4 children in orphanages , particularly those with disabilities like @entity12 , pictured big brother : @entity12 , 4 , spent @entity32 day getting to know her new family in @entity2 ' you just do n't know how , you feel like they 're your children , and the thought of them being locked away in an institution for the rest of their lives is almost hard to even bear			1
' @entity11 told the @entity160 she fears for children with special needs			0
' ' it 's just sickening , ' she said			0
' i do n't even want to believe that it can happen because it 's very personal to us			0
we know many families who are in the process to go to save these children from a horrible life			0
it just does n't make any sense that the children are the ones that are suffering because of retaliation in politics			0
' @entity7 points to people like @entity232 , who was given up shortly after birth by her parents in @entity235 but was raised by adoptive parents in the @entity7 and became a paralympic swimming champion			0
however , the @entity4 authorities point to the deaths of 19 @entity4 - born children adopted by @entity7 parents in the past decade , and lawmakers named the bill after a boy who died of heat stroke in @entity246 after his adoptive father left him locked in a car for hours			1
@entity5 reiterated @entity4 complaints that @entity7 courts have been too lenient on parents in such cases , saying @entity4 has inadequate access to @entity4 - born children in the @entity7 despite a bilateral agreement that entered into force on november 1			1
but @entity5 , who began a new six - year term in may and has searched for ways to unite the country during 13 years in power , suggested there were deeper motives for such a ban			0
success : @entity232 , pictured , was given up shortly after birth by her parents in @entity235 but was raised by adoptive parents in the @entity7 and became a paralympic swimming champion winner : @entity232 , pictured , won a gold medal for the women 's 100m freestyle @entity269 swimming final at the @entity270 ' for centuries , neither spiritual nor state leaders sent anyone abroad , ' he said , indicating he was not speaking specifically about @entity4 but about many societies			1
' they always fight for their national identities - they gather themselves together in a fist , they fight for their language , culture , ' he said			0
the banning of @entity7 adoptions plays on sensitivity in @entity4 about adoptions by foreigners , which skyrocketed as the social safety net unraveled with the 1991 @entity292 collapse			2
families from the @entity7 adopt more @entity4 children than those of any other country .			1

@entity12 among the last of some 60,000 @entity4 children to grow up in @entity7
now 50 @entity4 children on brink of adoption expected to miss out
@entity7 families adopt more @entity4 children than those of any other country
@entity62 estimates that 740,000 children not in parental custody in @entity4
only 18,000 @entity4 are on the waiting list to adopt a child
