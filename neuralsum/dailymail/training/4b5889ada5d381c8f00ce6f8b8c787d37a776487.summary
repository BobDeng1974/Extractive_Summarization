tv watchdog @entity0 has rejected complaints that comedian @entity3 's use of the word ' mong ' during a stand - up show was offensive			1
the @entity7 star and controversial comedian claimed that @entity11 's @entity10 singer @entity9 looked like a ' mong ' during his ' @entity14 ' live show on @entity15 last year			1
during a tirade about the @entity18 singer in october , @entity3 said : ' she would not be where she is today if it was n’t for the fact that she looked like such a f * * * * * g mong			0
' controversy : @entity3 , seen here in a picture posted on his @entity27 feed , branded @entity9 a ' mong ' and repeatedly used the term on the micro-blogging site last year outspoken : the comedian , pictured hosting the @entity32 last week , was described as ' exploratory and subversive ' in an @entity0 ruling today ' when she first came on the telly , i went , " is that a mong ? " you all did			1
' the jibes saw charity bosses write to @entity3 to demand he stop using the word , which they saw is a cruel nickname for @entity45 sufferers			0
@entity0 launched an investigation , but today cleared @entity15 of breaching guidelines on offensive content			1
the tv regulator ruled that although @entity3 's comments could cause ' considerable offence ' , they were justified in the context of a late night comedy show			1
@entity0 ruled that @entity3 's jibes towards @entity9 were ' justified in the context of provocative comedy ' during the show , @entity3 went on to say that he did n't mean @entity9 had @entity45 , and argued the word ' mong ' was no longer associated with sufferers of the condition			1
@entity0 said that in the name of freedom of expression , no word was banned after the tv watershed			0
however , there must be a good reason for using language many people find offensive			1
the regulator 's own research found that many people did not know of ‘ mong ’ came from the term ‘ mongoloid ’ – an offensive term for people with @entity45 ‟ s syndrome – but it ‘ could cause considerable offence to those who are aware of the association ’			1
in its ruling , @entity0 said : ' we noted that the programme began at 22:35 , more than an hour and a half after the watershed , and that therefore most viewers of the programme would have been expecting stronger and more challenging content			0
' the late scheduling of the programme , and its late night comedy context on @entity15 , meant that the majority of the audience was likely to expect the exploratory and subversive bent of the programme in general and of @entity3 's humour in particular			1
' offensive ' : @entity3 's previous use of the word ' mong ' saw him contacted by campaigners who demand he stop using the term the comedian has insisted the meaning of the word ' mong ' has changed over time ' we also took into account that @entity15 brought the challenging nature of the content to the attention of viewers with a warning at the start of the programme , which stated that it would contain ' strong language and adult humour '			1
' we therefore concluded that several aspects of this content had the potential to cause considerable offence			0
' however , on balance , this potential offence was justified by the context of this provocative comedy routine challenging the evolution of words , as broadcast with a warning as part of a late night comedy show on @entity15			1
' the broadcasting regulator did , however , issue a warning to tv bosses about the use of the word ' mong '			1
although @entity3 claims ' mong ' is no longer a derogatory term , the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) still classifies it as offensive : its entry states : ' @entity140 : a person with @entity45 's syndrome			1
now generally regarded as offensive			1
' the use of the word harks back to the implied similarity in appearance of those with @entity45 's syndrome and the @entity140 race of @entity151 - who established an empire in much of @entity154 during the 13th century			1
its un-pc usage is cited in the @entity133 as far back as 1866 : ' i have for some time had my attention directed to the possibility of making a classification of the feeble - minded by arranging them around various ethnic standards			2
' a very large number of congenital idiots are typical @entity166			0
' the citation is from none other than @entity171 - the man after whom @entity45 's syndrome was named			2
it was @entity45 's work at an asylum in @entity176 in the late 1860s that led to the term ' mongolian idiocy ' being used to classify certain clinical cases			2
it was not until 1961 that the term @entity45 was first used , following consultation with genetics experts unhappy with the previous label			0
they said their research showed it had the potential to be highly offensive and ' great care ' should be taken over its use			2
@entity3 has been criticised by the @entity191 for his repeated use of the word			0
the award - winning comedian and writer landed himself in hot water for a second time with his use of the word by repeatedly using the word ' mong ' on his @entity27 account and blog			1
after using the word on the mico - blogging site , @entity3 was eventually questioned by @entity204 , a disability campaigner and mother of two disabled girls			2
mrs @entity204 broke down in tears while discussing the row on @entity212 's @entity211 show last october			0
mrs @entity204 had wept while discussing the abuse directed at her daughters by people on the street using words like ‘ mong ’			0
multi-millionaire @entity3 went on to describe his use of ' mong ' as ' naive ' in an online conversation with mrs @entity204			0
@entity3 then contacted mrs @entity204 on @entity27 to offer ‘ a very public thank you ’ for her ‘ kind , rational and understanding words in private ’ since the issue broke			0
speaking about the controversy last year , @entity3 said : ' i have used ' mong ' , but never to mean @entity45 and never would			2
' the meaning of words change over time , ' gay ' for example			0
' the modern use of the word ' mong ' means dopey or ignorant , it 's in slang and urban dictionaries			0
' @entity15 argued that @entity3 was ' exploring the contemporary use of the word in a comedic context ' and said he did not mean to suggest @entity9 had a disability			1
after @entity3 's use of the word ' mong ' in october , @entity240 , director of @entity45 charity @entity242 , refuting his claim that the meaning of the word has changed			0
after learning of @entity0 's ruling , she told @entity247 today : it 's very sad that in effect @entity0 is excusing @entity3 because of the time the show was broadcast and a very loose warning about content and yet they issued a warning to tv bosses about the use of the word saying ' their research showed it had the potential to be highly offensive and ' great care ' should be taken over its use			2
' ' it 's almost like giving carte blanche to anyone to use offensive language directed at a particular group just as long as they do it at ' an appropriate time '			2
' why ca n't we just accept people for who they are ? and if we really ca n't cope with their differences ( usually from fear of the unknown or outdated and unrealistic stories i might add ) , ca n't we just avoid them without feeling the need to publicly poke fun at and humiliate them			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity9 refused to comment			0
representatives for @entity3 did not respond to requests for comment .			0
