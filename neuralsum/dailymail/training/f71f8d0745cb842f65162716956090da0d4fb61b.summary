by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:07 est , 28 june 2013 updated : 05:18 est , 29 june 2013 admittance : child killer @entity2 , murdered another four people letters emerged last night in which @entity2 reveals the details of four more murders he claims to have committed			1
in the handwritten letters , the @entity10 said he killed two men in his hometown of @entity14 and a man and a woman in @entity17			1
he also claims the body of missing @entity19 is buried in @entity20 , and not on @entity21 , near @entity17 , where painstaking searches have taken place over many years			1
the previously unseen letters emerged as @entity25 was told he must remain in a mental hospital indefinitely after his request to return to prison was refused			1
a mental health tribunal yesterday concluded the child killer ’s mental disorder was severe enough to justify his ongoing treatment at @entity34 high - security hospital			2
@entity25 , who was convicted of the murders of five children aged between ten and 17 , has made several claims over the years that he killed more victims			1
in 1987 he wrote to the @entity39 claiming he had killed five more people			2
four of these he confessed to killing in the latest letters , which he had written to @entity42 , a former journalist he was in contact with while in @entity34			1
@entity25 describes the four murders as ‘ happenings ’ and claims he killed a man on ‘ waste ground behind the station ’ , a ‘ woman ’ in a ‘ canal ’ , a man in @entity14 and another man ‘ above @entity51 ’ , a picturesque sea loch at the mouth of the @entity54			1
he also gave details of the four alleged murders to detective chief superintendent @entity59 , who led the search for @entity19 when @entity25 confessed to killing him in 1985			2
the claims were discussed in mr @entity59 ’s 1989 autobiography , in addition to an 18 - year - old youth @entity25 claimed to have killed and buried on the moors			1
but the detective said he had serious doubts about whether @entity25 was telling the truth , and even the killer himself had suggested some of his claims might be ‘ figments of his imagination ’			1
according to @entity25 , mr @entity59 told him a ‘ mentally retarded man ’ had confessed to the killing near the station but was never charged , and the woman found in the canal had been classed as a suicide despite ‘ the absence of a suicide note and the presence of a bruise on her head ’			1
still locked up : a mental health tribunal yesterday concluded @entity2 's mental disorder was severe enough to justify his ongoing treatment at @entity34 high - security hospital he alleges the detective told him records at @entity91 did not go back as far as the death of one of the men in @entity14 and the second did not match any reports of missing persons			1
@entity25 also claims he gave mr @entity59 ‘ names , places and methods used ’			2
he writes : ‘ my statements were an embarrassment to the police , who , rather than admit irregularities had taken place , will move mountains to cover up			2
’ in the same letter , dated november 24 , 1989 , he writes : ‘ as for @entity19			2
the area of the site is in @entity20 , not [ double underlined ] @entity110 , and should have been dealt with by the @entity111			0
‘ i have already stated my readiness to questioning under @entity113 [ sic ] so - called ‘ truth drug ’ , but not [ double underlined ] by the @entity115			0
’ it is unclear if @entity25 's claim that @entity19 's body is buried in ' @entity20 , not @entity110 ' is in reference to his disagreement with boundary changes , and does not mean @entity115 , who he has a grudge against , have been searching in the wrong area			0
last night it emerged the mental health tribunal process could be repeated almost immediately because @entity25 has the right to ask the authorities to review his detention every 12 months			0
victim : @entity19 , 12 , was snatched and murdered in 1964 the tribunal was delayed from last year due to @entity25 ’s ill health , meaning he could ask for another hearing later this year			2
under the @entity134 , @entity25 also has the right to challenge yesterday ’s decision , which would require a further hearing at an @entity138			0
the victims ’ families last night branded the tribunal system ‘ a farce ’ and ‘ circus ’			0
@entity144 , 59 , whose brother @entity145 was killed aged 12 in 1963 , said : ‘ that he should be allowed to have another tribunal with the huge cost and heartache it has caused is a total farce			0
' he uses the system as a plaything			0
it really does beggar belief			0
’ in the tribunal , estimated to have cost the taxpayer £ 250,000 , @entity25 argued he merely suffered from a personality disorder which should not preclude him being returned to a normal prison			0
the 75 - year - old painted himself as a victim , saying the conditions at the hospital in @entity162 were the ‘ catalyst ’ for his 13 - year hunger strike – although the hearing was told he regularly enjoyed cups of soup and toast			0
he denied eating in secret and refused to say whether he would try to starve himself to death if he was transferred from hospital to a prison			0
@entity173 , @entity175 's @entity174 , said : ' in the 1980s , @entity25 " confessed " to a number of other unrelated murders			0
' all these claims were thoroughly investigated at that time and found to be completely unsubstantiated			1
' a week hardly goes by when we do not receive some information which purports to lead us to @entity19 's burial site			0
' all of these claims are investigated and it remains our aim to find @entity19 for the sake of his surviving family members			1
' only one person knows where @entity19 is buried and he refuses to disclose that information , preferring to taunt @entity19 's loved ones , assisted by those who seek to profit from his manipulative scheming			0
' he added that the police force has seen similar correspondence between @entity25 and his confidantes and advisers , who ' have similar plans to capitalise on his notoriety after his death '			2
a @entity200 spokesman said : ‘ we have no ongoing inquiries into @entity2			1

@entity2 claims to have committed four more killings in new letters
' murdered ' two men in @entity14 and man and woman in @entity17
claims were ' thoroughly investigated ' and ' unsubstantiated ' , say police
