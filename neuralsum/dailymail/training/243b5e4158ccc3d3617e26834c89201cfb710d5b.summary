as the star of three @entity2 wins with @entity3 between 1978 and 1984 , @entity0 knows exactly how difficult it is to maintain success at the very highest level of football			1
but , even so , @entity9 ’s greatest - ever player admits to being genuinely stunned at just how speedily @entity11 ’s players have gone from dipping their toes in the pool of sporting immortality to , in @entity0 ’s own words , ‘ tumbling down the water slide ’ to ignominy and crisis			1
back in 2010 , the @entity20 giants were crowned @entity2 winners , swatting away the mighty @entity22 at the peak of their powers on the road to conquering the continent under @entity27			0
@entity28 ( second right ) celebrates with @entity11 team - mates during their match against @entity32 @entity0 believes that the @entity20 giants have fallen from grace in recent years just five years later , however , they are mere @entity35 strugglers under the faltering stewardship of former @entity38 boss @entity37			1
it represents quite a fall for such a proud and famous institution			0
few gave @entity42 a prayer of progressing when the teams were paired in the draw for the last - 32 of the @entity46			1
but @entity48 ’s side have come on leaps and bounds in recent weeks and , ahead of @entity11 ’s visit to @entity52 for the first leg on thursday , @entity0 sees no reason why his old team should fear a fixture that conjures up so many happy memories for the @entity59 club			1
@entity11 , naturally , will still be tough to push past if @entity42 are to reach the last 16			1
but 63 - year - old @entity0 feels @entity48 ’s improving side have at least a fighting chance of updating the history books with another famous victory over the club side @entity62 ’s men dispatched in @entity63 in 1967 to become the first @entity65 team ever to lift the @entity2			1
‘ there ’s been a demise at @entity11 , ’ said @entity0			1
stats from @entity73 @entity27 holds up the @entity2 trophy as @entity11 manager in 2010 but @entity11 are currently languishing in midtable in @entity77 under current boss @entity37 ‘ it was only in 2010 that they won the @entity2 under @entity27 in @entity80			2
but it ’s been like going down a water slide for them ever since			0
‘ five years later and they are lying tenth in @entity35 ? they have n’t been great			0
‘ they ’re definitely not as strong as they used to be			0
they ’ve brought in @entity37 but he ’s had one or two setbacks , too			0
they have n’t done as well as they expected with him coming in but he still knows how to win games			0
he ’s done exceptionally well in the past ( at @entity38 and a previous spell at @entity11 ) and it ’s still going to be exceptionally difficult for @entity42			1
‘ but while @entity42 had a hard time in the @entity2 earlier this season they have stayed patient , they have regrouped and they have done well in the @entity46			1
they ’ve got a chance			0
‘ in the end , it does n’t matter what @entity11 are like back in @entity20			2
it ’s about what they are like in the @entity46			2
but i think it will be a good game , a fantastic occasion and a brilliant atmosphere			0
’ the first - ever meeting of @entity42 and @entity11 , in @entity63 back in 1967 , remains the high water mark in @entity111 club football			1
after falling behind to @entity113 ’s penalty , @entity62 ’s @entity42 – playing what the manager later described as ‘ pure , beautiful , inventive football ’ – triumphed over the @entity20 masters of defending with goals from @entity119 and @entity120			2
the only other two competitive meetings to date between the @entity111 and the @entity20 went less well for the @entity52 club			0
in the @entity2 semi finals in 1972 , the classic @entity123 prevailed			0
after two goalless draws , @entity126 – on as a substitute for @entity0 - missed the vital penalty in a 5 - 4 shootout defeat			1
@entity42 captain @entity130 leads his side out for the @entity2 final in @entity63 in 1967 @entity133 lifts the trophy after @entity42 beat @entity11 2 - 1 to secure victory it cost @entity62 and @entity42 what would have been a third appearance in the final , against @entity139 in @entity140 , after they were defeated by @entity141 at the @entity142 in 1970 ’s showpiece			1
as a further reminder that the past is a foreign country , on the same night in 1972 that 75,000 were inside @entity52 for the @entity11 game , 80,000 crammed into @entity148 as @entity149 beat @entity150 2 - 0 on their way to winning the @entity152			1
if april 19 , 1972 made for an unforgettable evening of sport for the city of @entity59 , however , it does not remain uppermost in the memory of @entity0			2
he , admittedly , has far happier memories of his own in the competition , including scoring the only goal of the 1978 final for @entity3 against @entity161 of @entity162 at @entity163			0
‘ the shoot - out at @entity52 in 1972 was n’t great – but i ca n’t actually remember anything about the game , ’ confessed @entity0			1
‘ i would n’t know if we hit the post four times or if our goalie was magnificent			0
i could n’t tell you a thing ! ‘ would i like to see @entity42 get revenge for the defeat in 1972 ? well , maybe at the time @entity11 thought that was their revenge for 1967			1
that had been a real shock for them			0
they were expected to win easily in @entity63 and they even went 1 - 0 up before losing			2
‘ but they got their own back that night in 1972			0
it ’s 1 - 1 between the teams just now so we ’ll keep batting it backwards and forwards			2
but this match is going to be a massively romantic game with all the memories of 1967			0
it ’s going to be some night alright			0
