he died aged 42 after mistakes by @entity7 consultants , an inquest heard a father - of - two died of a heart infection after doctors missed three chances to save him , an inquest has heard			1
@entity3 , 42 , could have lived if doctors had put him on antibiotics just 48 hours sooner , it was said			1
but , despite displaying the telltale symptoms of infection , consultants at @entity7 missed three opportunities to treat the taxi - driver and former local football team manager and coach			1
at his inquest in @entity26 , heart expert professor @entity24 condemned the decisions made by hospital staff			2
describing dr @entity24 ’s evidence as ‘ compelling ’ , coroner @entity29 said : ' an appropriate physician should have been able to recognise the symptoms as indicated			0
had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would not have died			1
' mr @entity3 , from @entity34 , @entity7 , first visited his gp in october 2011 , suffering broken sleep , night sweats and lethargy			1
he was diagnosed with a chest infection , and prescribed antibiotics			2
but his symptoms worsened after a brief improvement , prompting further antibiotics and a referral			2
then at @entity7 on may 1 , 2012 , dr @entity45 , consultant rheumatologist , recognised his symptoms as indicating a heart infection , but after tests , failed to diagnose him			2
on his return on may 11 , dr @entity48 , consultant physician , again suspected mr @entity3 had a heart infection , but stopped his gp - prescribed antibiotics to carry out tests , including a heart scan			1
due to a system failure , the scan order never reached the right department			0
mr @entity3 with mother @entity57 , wife @entity58 , 44 , daughter @entity4 , now 14 , son @entity59 , now 18			1
if the popular father had had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would not have died , it was said on may 14 , yet another consultant re-ordered the scan urgently , but when his condition was finally diagnosed the next day , and an antibiotics drip was started , it was too late			1
he suffered a cardiac arrest and died on may 15			1
coroner @entity29 said mr @entity3 , who had a congenital condition which made him more susceptible to infection , died of endocarditis			1
coroner @entity29 said mr @entity3 , who had a congenital condition which made him more susceptible to infection , died of endocarditis he said contributory factors were ‘ significant failures ’ on may 1 and may 11 to recognise his symptoms and failure to start the right antibiotics drip by the 12th			1
he said if the young father had the right scan , diagnosis and treatment earlier , he probably would have survived			2
recording a narrative verdict , mr @entity29 added : ' these medical practitioners are bound to reflect upon their involvement but at the time they thought they were making the right judgements			0
' but they were not judgements that were well - founded			0
' @entity92 and well - liked mr @entity3 lived in @entity93 and worked for @entity7 ’s @entity94			1
more than 800 people attended his funeral and he left behind wife @entity58 and children @entity59 , 18 , and @entity4 , 14			0
after the hearing his wife , 44 , said : ' @entity7 has not only let our family down but they have let our entire community down			0
' @entity3 was a wonderful family man but also so well - known and loved in the community			1
' the findings of the inquest have confirmed the family ’s view that @entity3 ’s death could and should have been avoided if only he had been provided with appropriate and prompt clinical care and management during his time in hospital			1
' a @entity114 spokesman said : ' we would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of mr @entity3 following their very sad loss			2
' the trust has reflected on its practice following its investigation to understand what lessons can be learned			0
' we will also give full and careful consideration to the comments and feedback from the coroner			0
' infective endocarditis is an infection that can seriously damage the heart valves and cause other serious complications if not treated quickly with antibiotics			2
after someone has suffered from the infection they often require surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves			0
it is an infection that affects some parts of the endocardium - the tissue that lines the inside of the heart chambers			0
the infection usually involves one or more of the heart valves which are part of the endocardium - it is serious and life - threatening			0
most cases are caused by a bacterial infection and usually occur in a person who has an infection or a wound in another part of the body			0
people who inject street drugs are also at greater risk as they can also inject bacteria into their bloodstream if they use dirty needles			0
in the @entity161 , endocarditis occurs in about 20 in a million people each year			0
it is most common in people with heart valve problems , have had heart valve surgery , have congenital heart defects or who have a poor immune system			0
symptoms include feeling generally unwell , having aches and pains , tiredness , fever and loss of appetite .			0
