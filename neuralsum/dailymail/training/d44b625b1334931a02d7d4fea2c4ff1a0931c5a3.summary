with nine in every 10 cosmetic operations now involving either fillers or @entity3 , jabs are fast becoming a routine part of the average beauty regime			1
but there 's a snag : unlike surgery , cosmetic fillers remain unregulated and as a result , horror stories about bungled procedures that leave people disfigured and traumatised are increasing			1
one woman who knows the risks of cosmetic filler all too well is @entity17 , a 41 - year - old mother - of - four from @entity18 who was left with infected lumps all over her face after being injected with permanent filler			1
shocking : @entity17 , 41 , was left with lumps all over her face after cosmetic filler became infected although initial injections using non-permanent lip plumpers had worked well , ms @entity17 wanted a procedure that lasted and when she was offered the chance to have an irreversible injection for Â£ 700 , she jumped at the chance			1
' they [ the surgeon ] said " if you have this done , you do n't have to worry about coming back and having needles " , ' she remembers			0
' i did n't think anything would go wrong			0
' because it was so expensive , i did n't expect them to inject anything bad into my face			0
' at first she was pleased with the results but seven years after having the treatment , her lips broke out in lumpy sores that oozed pus			0
worse , lumps began appearing all over her face as the filler migrated through fatty tissue , leaving her distraught and too embarrassed to leave the house			2
painful : her lips were covered in pus - filled sores while lumps of filler migrated to other parts of her face painful : ms @entity17 had to undergo a two hour operation to remove the lumps of plastic in a bid to repair the damage , she went to see the surgeon who had performed the original procedure and asked him to help			1
his solution ? injecting the lumps with an anti-inflammatory - a process that ms @entity17 describes as ' extremely painful '			1
' they were as hard as rocks and i think that angered me more , ' she adds			0
' he 's never apologised - he never said sorry			0
' what 's left in my face is hard plastic and hence my body is rejecting it and pushing it out			2
' and she 's not the only person to have suffered the ill - effects of permanent fillers			2
of those who have them , 49 per cent experience problems and of those , 89 per cent need to have surgery to resolve them			1
the issues created by permanent fillers have not gone unnoticed			2
speaking to the independent newspaper , leading @entity92 surgeon , dr @entity89 said : ' all of the permanent fillers are creating , from time to time , serious problems with bumps and deformities , and sometimes you have to operate			1
dangerous : leading surgeons recommend avoiding permanent filler because of the risk of problems improvement : although ms @entity17 has been left with faint scars following surgery , the lumps are finally gone difference : ms @entity17 says since surgery , she 's no longer afraid to smile and leave the house ' all serious plastic surgeons agree one should avoid permanent fillers			1
we will see in the future patients of 50 who have had 15 years of fillers with fibrous , tough tissue we would n't be able to do anything with			0
' another leading cosmetic surgeon , @entity114 based dr @entity115 , added : ' the issues with permanent fillers are all the same in my opinion			2
' the filler needs to be injected into the fatty tissues of the face but fatty layers of the face do n't stay put			2
if they did , we would literally be out of business			0
' for ms @entity17 , and others like her , the only solution is more surgery to remove the hard lumps of plastic dotted around the face			1
@entity138 - facial specialist , dr @entity133 , who appears , along with ms @entity17 , in tonight 's episode of @entity136 documentary , botched up bodies , adds : ' you can easily end up with a permanent problem , which with something that was meant to treat something that was a small problem in the first place , is a real shame			1
' after years of suffering thanks to her disfigured face , ms @entity17 , at least , has had the happy ending she hoped for			1
five weeks after surgery to remove the plastic - filled lumps , her complexion is visibly smoother and the weeping sores are gone			0
' it 's made a huge difference , ' she says excitedly			0
' i keep being told i have a really nice smile , which is great ! ' i can finally look people in the eye and talk to them			0
i 'm no longer hanging my head in shame and hiding away			0
' @entity161 , tonight at 10pm on @entity136			0
