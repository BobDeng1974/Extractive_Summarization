@entity1 ’s hopes of qualifying for the quarter finals at the @entity4 hang by a thread after they drew with @entity6 in @entity7			1
@entity8 rounded off a fine move with a clinical finish early in the second half to give @entity13 ’s side the lead , but @entity15 , bizarrely wearing gloves despite the stifling jungle heat , leveled things up 15 minutes later with a towering header			1
the result puts @entity6 top of the competitions ’s ‘ @entity22 ’ , a point ahead of both @entity25 and @entity26 , but @entity1 must win their final game against the @entity25 to have any chance of progression			1
@entity1 's @entity30 ( right ) celebrates @entity8 's opening goal against @entity6 @entity6 's defender @entity32 ( right ) celebrates after scoring the equaliser against @entity1 after a first half of few chances , the game came to life in the second , with @entity8 ’s goal igniting a crowd that had already watched 135 minutes of football with barely a shot on target following the bore-fest earlier between the group 's other two sides			1
a neat move saw @entity48 striker @entity30 create space and feed @entity50 down the right			0
his low cross found @entity8 at the back post and the @entity55 winger made no mistake , slotting coolly past @entity57			1
as it had in their previous game against @entity25 , going a goal behind brough @entity6 out of their shells			1
they had shaded the possession from the off , but aside from an early run from @entity69 ’s @entity68 , returning from injury after missing the win over @entity25 with a troublesome hamstring , the @entity64 carried little threat from open play , despite their array of forwards			0
however , when the majority of your team are over six foot and built like a fleet of tanks , set pieces will always be a threat			0
@entity1 's goalkeeper @entity84 clears the ball during the @entity87 clash @entity1 's @entity88 ( left ) challenges @entity6 's @entity89 for possession and so it proved			1
having gone close several times - @entity96 ’s @entity95 the most culpable – and having had a @entity68 goal disallowed correctly for offside , finally the @entity64 superiority in the air told			0
@entity99 got up highest at the back post and powered a header over @entity102 to equalize			0
the keeper was not directly at fault , but it was his uncertainty under the high ball that contributed to @entity1 ’s nervousness at set pieces			2
@entity109 always looked shaky , twice misjudging a cross and almost dropping it into his own net , and fumbling @entity95 ’s header in the lead - up to @entity68 ’s disallowed goal			0
you have to sympathise with the @entity1 boss @entity13 – after first choice keeper ’s @entity118 tragic death just weeks ago , he decided @entity120 would get the number one jersey			2
but @entity120 was at fault for at least one , perhaps two of the three goals @entity1 conceded against @entity26 , and @entity13 has had to call upon @entity84 , who just a few months ago was considered fourth choice for the national side			2
the 27 - year - old did make one excellent save , however , pushing away @entity128 ’s shot at full stretch as @entity6 pushed for a winner			1
@entity1 's @entity131 ( left ) challenges @entity6 and @entity69 's @entity132 @entity1 's @entity88 , celebrates their opener against @entity6 on friday @entity6 's @entity135 ( left ) challenges @entity1 's @entity30 in the air @entity6 's defender @entity99 ( centre ) celebrates after levelling the tie on the hour mark the result was harsh on @entity1 , who played some lovely football before falling to defeat in their first game on monday , and again showed plenty of one - touch interplay around the box , threatening to create chances			1
however , actually breaching a well - organised @entity64 backline proved difficult , and @entity152 was rarely overly stretched in goal			0
@entity154 forced @entity152 into a sharp save with a rising drive after a lovely passage of play , and @entity158 fired just wide from a similar move on the other side , but chances were relatively few and far between			0
the niggly nature of the game suited @entity6 , who carried far more physical presence , particularly in midfield			2
@entity167 midfielder , and @entity1 captain , @entity88 was incensed by one tackle in particular , when @entity169 lunged in on @entity170 , but escaped a booking			0
and , in the end , it was the extra height and presence that the @entity6 side possessed , rather than any particular skill , that could have earned them all three points , @entity99 coming close to his second goal , again with a header from a set piece , in the closing stages .			0

@entity1 's hopes of qualifying for quarter - finals hang by a thread
@entity189 ' @entity8 's opener was cancelled out by @entity32 of @entity6
