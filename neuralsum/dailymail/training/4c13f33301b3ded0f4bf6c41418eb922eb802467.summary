@entity15 , 17 , is currently a patient at @entity16 after contracting septicaemia - a blood infection - due to the condition @entity19 ( @entity19 ) she has which means she ca n’t digest food			0
the teenager has been unable to eat any food for more than six months - and has to be fed through a tube taking nutrients straight to her heart			0
but after a rare visit to a restaurant with her mother , @entity4 , and sister , @entity31 , after she was allowed to leave hospital for a few hours , she was left mortified when a waitress told the party had not spent enough money as @entity2 was not eating - and allegedly asked them to leave			1
the family claim a waitress at the @entity39 in the @entity40 , near @entity16 ( @entity16 ) told the family they would have to order a third meal - as they were pennies under the restaurant ’s minimum spend of £ 6 per diner			1
although stunned mother @entity4 explained that her daughter @entity2 was unable to eat - and even offered to show staff the tube taking nutrients into her heart - they claim they were told there would be ' no exceptions			1
' one staff member even suggested @entity2 could have ' just a starter ' - and offered to let the family buy food to take away and eat later			1
@entity4 said : ' i am furious at the way my daughter was treated			0
' it is hard enough for @entity2 to go into a restaurant knowing she ca n’t eat - but she wanted to go out because her sister had come to visit her , and they were only allowed out of hospital for a short time			1
' @entity2 is a very thoughtful girl , and she knows that her sister really likes the food at this restaurant - and said she wanted to go , even though she could n’t have anything to eat			1
' the @entity71 in @entity72 where a family claims they received poor treatment from staff the three women visited the restaurant on tuesday lunchtime - the day before @entity2 underwent risky surgery to have a portacath - which connects the central line that allows fluids to travel to her heart - replaced after it became infected with the bout of septicemia			1
she had been looking forward to going to the restaurant as they sell iced tea - one of only a small number of drinks she can have - and she wanted that as her only 500ml dose of fluids allowed that day			0
@entity4 said : ' @entity2 was quite happy to sit and just have a drink while we both had food , but we were told that because there were three diners , we had to spend at least £ 18			1
' i had ordered food and drinks that came to more than £ 17 - we were pennies off the minimum spend			1
' the food bill for @entity4 and @entity31 came to almost £ 13 and the two bottles of water and iced tea they ordered would have tipped them close to the requested £ 18 fee for three people to dine in the restaurant			0
' i explained that really there were only two diners in our party , and told them about @entity2 ’s condition			1
she even had a @entity16 wristband on , but then the waitress suggested she just had a starter - or even ordered some food and took it home later			0
' i said we did n’t want anything else to eat , but we were told we ’d have to leave			2
@entity2 during treatment at @entity119			2
there is no known cure for her condition that leaves her unable to digest food @entity2 , who is fed through a tube , received a visit from @entity126 during one of her stays at @entity16 ' she went to speak to the manager , who i explained the situation to as well - but he told me i did n’t understand the situation , and all i had to do was buy some more food for @entity2			1
' there was no compassion , and they did n’t even bother to try and understand what i was explaining to them			0
' it ’s not about the money - i could n’t care less whether the meal cost £ 100 - but @entity2 was so upset she ’s been made to feel like she had done something wrong			1
' when the waitress was talking to us , i could see the look in @entity2 ’s eyes - she was devastated by how she was treated			2
' the restaurant is a five minute walk from @entity16 , and a lot of children are probably taken there by their parents on rare days away from the hospital			0
' i ’d hate to think any other child with dietary requirements was made to feel so small over a few pence			0
' when we went back to the hospital , all the doctors and nurses who had been treating @entity2 were appalled			2
' @entity2 shows the tube that takes nutrition to her heart for 12 hours a day @entity2 , from @entity162 , @entity163 , has to be fed by tube to her heart which feeds liquid nutrients into her blood stream , but what the future holds for her is uncertain			2
there is no known cure			0
@entity2 said : ' i ’ve got one life , i ’ve just got to laugh and enjoy it			2
' a spokesperson from the @entity8 and @entity9 disputed the family 's account of events , and said : ' we are saddened to learn of the unfortunate experience our customers had at our restaurant during the busy lunch hours			1
' the customers , a couple with a young girl ( later we learned she had a serious health problem , being unable to eat ) , ordered two meals and a drink , amounting to approx. £ 14 to £ 15 , just shy of £ 18 to make the average £ 6 per head			2
' our staff explained to the customers our rule , i.e. minimum spending of £ 6 per head as written on the menu , and offered them an option to order something extra or take - away meals to make up the spending shortage			1
but the customers were somehow just upset and were unwilling to consider this option we offered			0
' learning that the girl has just come out of a hospital , our staff apologised and said we are making an exception this time to enable them to enjoy dining at our restaurant			1
' unfortunately , however , the customers decided to leave			2
' we are a very busy and popular restaurant , often with a long queue seen outside , and well - known for providing quality meals at affordable prices			0
' therefore , we have to ensure that there is a good turnover of customers to satisfy the needs of all our good customers and that is why we have certain rules in place			0
' it is felt that our staff treated the customers fairly and well , and made a kind concession too			0
we are just saddened to hear of the unhappy incident			0
in order to show our goodwill , our management has decided to contact the customers to send them a @entity227			0

mother says her family were asked to leave because daughter 's lack of meal meant they did *n't* meet ' minimum spend '
she added that staff asked them to order a starter for @entity2 , even though she can not eat
restaurant spokesman claims staff said they would make an exception for daughter after learning of her condition but family decided to go
