' you 're too fat , ' is something no woman should ever have to hear in the workplace			0
but for @entity5 , who has made a living for the past fifteen years modelling in the plus size clothes market , the insult is a regular occurrence			2
in the last 12 months , the 27 - year - old from @entity10 has been elevated to the ranks of supermodel - gracing the cover of @entity14 earlier this year and featuring in both @entity16 magazine and @entity17 this month			1
supermodel @entity5 has launched a lingerie range ( featured in pic ) across @entity20 for plus - size women after being taunted all of her life over weight			1
the @entity25 is hoping to encourage women to embrace their curves but that does n't meant that the model is treated with kid gloves - her size means she is regularly subjected to a whole host of verbal abuse both outside and inside of the industry			1
she said : ' i have been in , i 've been out , i 've been too fat , i 've been too thin , i 've been too ethnic , i 've been too white , i 've had people tell me i 'm too ugly			2
' you really have to have thick skin to be ( plus - size ) in this industry			0
' but after decades of completely ignoring overweight women in fashion , film and music , @entity5 believes that the tide is finally changing thanks to more and more women speaking out about their needs being ignored			1
she has just launched her own 19 - piece lingerie range for plus - sized online retailer @entity51 , with bras starting at @entity53 and going up to @entity54			1
with the average @entity56 woman in the @entity56 now a size 16 , @entity5 hopes we are seeing an end to a clothing market focused solely on the perfect size ten			2
@entity5 wants more fashion houses to use curvy models so that the general public can see themselves represented on tv and in magazines she said : ' to see the changes in this industry is phenomenal and i 'm excited to see where it 's going			1
' i really feel that curves are in and everything that i do on @entity73 is # curvesarein			0
' ( as plus size models ) we go on the runway castings as much as we can for the high end designers that have never done plus - size before			2
' and for the beauty adverts - just because i 'm plus - size does n't mean that i ca n't do a beauty or hair campaign			0
' i was on the cover of @entity14 at the beginning of the year , i have done some editorial for @entity84 and i 'm in @entity16 and miss @entity17 right now , so it 's happening			2
' that 's when you know the industry is changing			0
' often , change starts with prominent public figures taking a stand and @entity5 believes that @entity56 singer @entity92 is one of the stars that have really helped push the cause of curvy women in the western world			1
although @entity5 is larger than your average model , she maintains a healthy and active lifestyle she said : ' with @entity92 , people are n't looking at her and saying that 's a big girl who can sing , they 're just saying that 's @entity92			1
' but it 's still something lingering over people 's minds			0
' @entity108 is still only cast for big girl roles - i think that there is still that struggle in tv and film but she is still getting very high - profile roles			0
' however , there is still most of the work to be done , in the last two fashion weeks - during february this year and the most recent one last month - @entity5 maintains that all of the big fashion houses did not want to use anybody plus - size on their catwalks			1
she said : ' in february 's fashion week and this fashion week , no high end designers wanted to use plus - size			2
' there was a backlash - they saw us and they thought we were great , but they also said they were't ready to work with us yet			0
over years of working in fashion , @entity5 has worked out how to dress to best flatter her figure - she enjoys both accentuating her hourglass figure ( left ) and wearing slouchy clothes ( right ) ' so while they see the curves and the plus - size , there are n't any high end designers putting curves on the catwalk yet			1
' but things are going to be changing soon , the fact that they are open to seeing plus - size models at castings - that 's a big deal			1
' @entity5 is most concerned about pushing through a change because she believes is is something that normal women need to see - plus - size women being admired and welcomed by the media and fashion - in order to feel good about themselves			1
she said : ' i think seeing plus - size women on catwalks gives normal women confidence by knowing that there are actually people their size			2
' they want to see themselves in the magazine - whether they are 13 or 45 , they want to see someone representing them on a billboard , in a magazine or in a campaign			0
@entity5 for @entity173 collection left to right : padded bra , £ 39 , @entity175 bra , £ 39 , pearl bra , £ 39 , lace bra , £ 39			2
bra sizes range from @entity53 to @entity54 @entity5 for @entity51 pants collection , each £ 17 ' it 's important for women to see body diversity in the community reflected in the media and you can tell it 's wanted			1
' ' i have talked to multiple girls in different high schools with some other plus - size models , i also just went to a weight loss camp in @entity191 and it was really interesting because there were girls from a @entity25 size six ( @entity56 10 ) and some as a @entity25 size 22 ( @entity56 26 )			1
' these girls could n't believe that there were these models who were plus - size , who were excited about their curves and who were in the media			1
' they do n't know that it exists and they were excited and they said to us , ' thank you for making me feel so incredible about my body			0
' i do n't have role models like this but you have created one for me			0
' dress for your body type - trends do n't necessarily matter buy classic pieces that you can wear in five or six years time - your wardrobe will grow immensely be confident to show off your hourglass figure if you feel good in an outfit then it shows - @entity5 would rather be half an hour late than not feel good in what she 's wearing for the day ' to have 13,14 and 15 - year - old girls say this was so nice and it really makes me want to do something about the fashion industry			1
' and while @entity5 is full of positivity about women embracing their bodies , the model maintains that she is extremely anti-overeating			2
over the years , being a plus - size model has made her a figurehead for the anti-fat brigade , with people accusing her of making the world an unhealthier place by promoting curvy bodies			0
she said : ' i absolutely hate that			0
to the people who say i am pro-obesity , i laugh in their face			0
' i am pro-health and i am pro-diversity			0
' if you look on my @entity73 page , you can see that i work out constantly and i have a workout video coming out that shows you how to work out and keep your curves			0
' i work out three - four days a week but i can modify my eating to kind of what i want , i also like green juices and healthy salads			0
' i just happen to be big boned and have an extra layer of meat on me			0
