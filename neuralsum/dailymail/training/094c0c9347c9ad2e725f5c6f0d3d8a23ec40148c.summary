@entity9 celebrates in style as @entity1 defeat @entity3 4 - 0 to reach @entity6 quarter - finals @entity1 manager @entity0 is refusing to start thinking of @entity16 as the @entity1 battle relegation ' it was a good performance , we 're very pleased , but there 's still a long way to go in the league and obviously we need a little but of luck in the next draw			1
' @entity0 was more forthright about two - goal @entity34 and dismissed speculation the club 's Â£ 10million record signing was set for @entity40 exit door during the winter transfer window			2
' even if we had brought @entity42 ( @entity43 ) in , we still would 've needed another forward to have stayed so i 'm not so sure he would 've left , ' @entity0 added			0
@entity9 scored an impressive brace despite being linked with a move away from the @entity48 in january @entity1 midfielder @entity10 scored the goal of the game with a sublime long - range effort ' but he 's done absolutely fantastic and there was a weight on his shoulders and scoring goals takes that weight off your shoulders and he 's blossomed and looks a good player			1
' while @entity0 refuses to look further than the next round , @entity9 , who has scored four goals in three games , sees no reason why @entity1 can not win the trophy at @entity16 in may			1

former @entity1 stra @entity73 strikes @entity75 in full view of referee @entity77 @entity73 gives referee @entity77 no choice but to send him off in the second half @entity3 's miserable afternoon was made all the worse by substitute @entity73 's second - half dismissal and @entity3 boss @entity81 believes his side 's recent fixture congestion has finally caught up with them			1
' i would say it ( the defeat ) was probably coming based on what we 've had to cope with over the last few weeks and i think it told on us today , there 's no doubt about that , ' he said			0
' i have to give @entity1 a lot of credit - they were very good			2
i do n't want to take any credit away from them , particularly the front two today , but i look at the players and there was not the energy we know they 've got based on all they 've done in the last few weeks			0
' on @entity73 's dismissal , @entity81 added : ' it 's unprofessional , is n't it ? the punishment is laid down in our code of conduct and by the @entity110			0
