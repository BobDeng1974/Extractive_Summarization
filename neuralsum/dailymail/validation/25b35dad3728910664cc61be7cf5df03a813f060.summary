millions of working class families will be given the chance to buy their own homes under radical @entity3 plans to extend @entity5 's flagship housing policy			1
under proposals being considered by @entity12 , the right - to - buy scheme - currently restricted to families in council owned properties - will be extended to up to 2.5million housing association tenants			1
@entity13 hopes the ' big door step offer ' will sway enough working class voters to earn him a second term as prime minister			1
since right - to - buy was set up in 1980 by the conservative prime minister @entity5 , more than two million council houses have been sold under a plan being championed by the work and pensions secretary @entity22 , housing association tenants will be given the right to buy their homes at a knockdown price			1
since right - to - buy was set up in 1980 , more than two million council houses have been sold , but current rules make it difficult for those in housing associations to buy their homes			2
housing associations are non-profit making private bodies that provide low - cost social housing			2
regulated by the state , they receive public funding			0
right - to - buy rules allow most council tenants to buy their homes at a discount , but the rules do not apply to housing associations			1
they only qualify for limited discounts and can only buy a property that has been acquired by an association since 1997			0
discounts vary between areas , but range from £ 9,000 to £ 16,000			0
council house tenants , by contrast , can get discounts of up to £ 77,000 across @entity52 and £ 102,700 in @entity53			0
@entity13 hopes a ' big door step offer ' on housing will sway enough working class voters to earn him a second term as prime minister under the new plans , housing associations will be able to use the funds from the sale of the houses to build more homes , the @entity59 has reported			1
taxpayers ' money will be used to fund the discounts , which are expected to be 30 % off the market value of the home			0
a more radical plan advanced by @entity22 , to simply give away housing association properties to those who have worked for a year , has been ditched			2
number 10 believe it would cost votes among those who have worked for much longer to save for their own home			0
a senior @entity12 source said : ' you are safe to say that broadening right - to - buy is on the cards			1
' but the source added : ' giving away homes is off the table			0
if your message is that you want to reward people who work hard and get on , it would n't be seen as fair to give homes to people in social housing while others have been saving for years to buy their own place			0

right - to - buy could be extended to up to 2.5m housing association tenants
