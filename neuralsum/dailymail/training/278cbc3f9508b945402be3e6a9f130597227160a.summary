by @entity0 @entity1 died in january after doctors at the @entity3 in @entity4 inserted a chest drain into the wrong lung , causing it to collapse a ' series of failings ' at a @entity11 hospital led to the death of a great - grandfather after doctors operated on the wrong lung			1
@entity1 , 85 , was rushed to hospital with several chronic diseases and a collapsed left lung			1
doctors took him into theatre for a procedure to help his breathing - but in a fatal error , the surgeon operated on his right one			1
the great - grandfather - of - four , who had been admitted five days earlier to @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity11 , died just three hours after the operation			1
coroner @entity28 , concluding the inquest in @entity30 , @entity11 , said a number of ' failings ' by the hospital led to mr @entity1 's death			1
ms @entity28 said : ' mr @entity1 suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a left pneumothorax [ air that is trapped next to a lung ]			1
' a series of failings by the @entity40 have caused or contributed to the cause of death			1
' she added that an ' erroneous aspiration ' - the drainage of air or fluid - in the right chest cavity caused his death after a number of ' systematic errors '			1
the registrar , dr @entity52 carried out a procedure on mr @entity1 , called an aspiration , on the evening of january 22			2
this is when air between the chest wall and lung , which causes the collapse , is removed using a needle and syringe			0
but the inquest heard she had been given an inaccurate medical note written by another doctor which said the right lung needed treatment - when it was the left			1
when she discovered she had treated the wrong lung she carried out an aspiration on the right one			0
but both lungs had by then collapsed and mr @entity1 , from @entity73 , @entity11 , died about three hours after the treatment			1
the inquest heard there were a number of blunders made before the procedure , including failing to give mr @entity1 a chest drain			1
in her conclusion , ms @entity28 found dr @entity81 failed to request an x-ray before carrying out the procedure , despite the most recent scan being more than two days old			0
the inquest heard the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity11 apologised to mr @entity87 's family and has implemented a raft of changes to ensure similar mistakes are not made in the future the same doctor also failed to check the existing radiology immediately before the procedure and did not examine mr @entity1 to check her findings matched the data			1
the coroner branded the hospital ' conservative ' for treating his condition with antibiotics , nebulisers and steroids and found he had been inappropriately prescribed other medication			2
furthermore , it failed to provide an on - call respiratory consultant and kept medical records in a ' confusing format ' , the coroner said			2
in a statement , mr @entity1 's heartbroken sons @entity110 and @entity111 said their father , who ran a nursery all his life with his brothers , should not have ' been left to suffer '			2
mr @entity1 's sons @entity111 and @entity110 said : '' our father is missed by many friends , family , grandchildren and great grandchildren ' they said : ' we have yet to see any proof that systems have been improved within the trust since his death			2
' we do now believe that the treatment provided to our father was unsatisfactory			0
he should not have been left to suffer for more than five days before any action was taken to ease his suffering			2
' if earlier action had been taken then perhaps this " out of hours " procedure would not have taken place at all - or may not have resulted in a fatal consequence			1
' we have made it clear to @entity81 , and have told her so personally , that we hold no ill feelings towards her and hope that she will continue with a successful medical career			0
' we feel that she is another victim here , let down by some of her medical colleagues and the lack of systems put in place by management			0
' our father is missed by many friends , family , grandchildren and great grandchildren			0
we do not want his premature death to be in vain			0
' mr @entity1 was the widower of @entity155 , with whom he was married to for almost 60 years			0
he is survived by two sons , three grandchildren and four great grandchildren			0
dr @entity81 still works for @entity160			0
but dr @entity161 , who was supposed to fit the chest drain , does not			0
a trust spokesman said : ' we would like to express our sincere sympathy to his family and apologise for the errors in his care			0
' the trust has taken this incident extremely seriously and , following a detailed investigation , has put in place a series of steps to attempt to reduce the risk of these events from occurring again			0
' he added they are carefully considering the concerns of the coroner and new protocol and checklists for all procedures on patient 's lungs has also been put in place .			2
