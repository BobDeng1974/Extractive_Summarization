just a few years ago , @entity0 was worried her partner @entity1 would die in his sleep because of severe breathing problems brought on by his excess weight			1
now the couple , from @entity6 , have shed nearly 22 stone between them – with @entity1 losing more than half his body weight – and have compiled a ' slim list ' of things they plan to do to celebrate their amazing achievement			1
tipping the scales at 29st 5lbs @entity1 , 51 , suffered with sleep apnoea , which regularly saw him stop breathing in his sleep , and 55 - year - old @entity0 feared one day he might not wake up			1
since joining @entity27 and losing a combined weight of 21st 11lbs , the pair have been named as the organisation 's @entity29 2015			1
@entity1 and @entity0 , who have been together for 25 years , began to have weight problems around 15 years ago			1
@entity1 said : ' we stopped smoking and replaced cigarettes with snacks like crisps , sandwiches and pies			2
around the same time we got a second car so did n't need to walk places anymore			0
' then when the kids – i have two daughters and @entity0 has one daughter from previous relationships – left home we fell into the habit of eating more takeaways and washing them down with a bottle of wine			2
' a low point : @entity1 was left mortified after a wooden chair collapsed underneath him at a family barbecue			2
at that point , he decided that losing weight was his only option the couple , pictured before their weightloss , began to have weight problems around 15 years ago when they began to replace cigarettes with snacks however things changed when , in summer 2010 , @entity1 was left mortified after a wooden chair collapsed beneath him at a family barbecue			1
the garden furniture broke into pieces and cut into @entity1 ' leg , which became infected with cellulitis and worsened and ulcerated because of his weight			2
soon after , @entity1 suffered further embarrassment when he was unable to fit into a hotel shower and the couple had to request a new room			2
so when his doctor , who was a @entity27 member herself , recommended @entity1 join his local group in may 2011 , he decided losing weight was his only option			1
@entity1 , pictured before his weight loss , used to eat 3 or 4 slices of toast with butter or a sausage sandwich with tomato sauce just for breakfast @entity1 , pictured at 29st 5lbs on a camping holiday , regularly stopped breathing in his sleep @entity1 said : ' my leg was in a real mess and it was getting to the point where they did n't know what else to do , i started to worry that i might actually lose my leg			1
' i knew i had to do something about my weight			0
i was embarrassed and worried because i thought i 'd be the only man in a roomful of women , so @entity0 agreed to come with me			2
' as soon as we walked through the doors though , we were warmly welcomed and made to feel comfortable – it was nothing like we 'd expected			0
now i ca n't wait to go to group every week			0
' @entity0 lost 4st 9lbs , going from 15st 4.5lbs to 10st 9.5lbs , and dropped from a dress size 22 to a 12 @entity1 and @entity0 , holding an old pair of @entity1 's jeans - he has since dropped 32 inches from his waist the pair began following @entity27 's @entity111 programme and swapped their regular takeaways for healthy home - cooked meals , including their favourite friday night dinner of homemade cheese burgers and @entity27 - style chips ( baked in the oven )			1
in his first week @entity1 lost 8.5lbs and since then he has gone on to lose a total of 17st 2lbs , going from 29st 5lbs to 12st 3lbs , and dropped 32 inches from his waist			1
his health problems are gone and he 's discovered a passion for healthy eating : ' our tastes have changed completely since we started slimming			0
' we do n't even want the foods we used to enjoy because the meals that we make at home are so much nicer			0
the pair joined @entity27 's programme and swapped their unhealthy diets for home - cooked meals			1
@entity1 shed a total of 17st 2lb and @entity0 lost 4st 9lbs ' i 've learned so much about healthy eating , and i wanted to share that so i 'm in the process of setting up a healthy catering company			1
' meanwhile @entity0 , who works for a children 's charity , has lost 4st 9lbs , going from 15st 4.5lbs to 10st 9.5lbs , and dropped from a dress size 22 to a 12 to fit into her first pair of jeans for more than 20 years			1

before we used to just sit in our extra-large camping chairs and watch the kids running around			0
' now we 're running around with them , swimming with them , and it 's much more fun			0
it 's really important to us because you do n't get those times back			0
' @entity1 and @entity0 are also keen walkers and have climbed the highest peak in @entity183 twice , and @entity1 enjoys cycling and finds a round of golf much easier nowadays			1
in fact , the pair have so much more energy that they decided to compile a ' slim list ' of places they 'd like to visit and things they 'd like to do minus their extra 21st 11lbs , which includes travelling to @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 and re-visiting the @entity201 so that they can fit comfortably into the seats			1
@entity0 says : ' we 'd never been abroad as a couple , we would n't have dreamed of trying to go on a plane because @entity1 would never have fit into the seats			1
@entity1 , pictured before his weight loss , said he would dine on spaghetti bolognese with cheese on top and a garlic bread baguette , a takeaway from the local chip shop or a pizza for dinner at his heaviest , 51 - year - old @entity1 was 29st 5lb , but went on to lose more than half his original body weight ( right )			1
he now tips the scales at 12 stone 3lb ' now we 've been to @entity199 and to @entity198 and we had a brilliant time			1
it 's like a whole new world has opened up for us			0
' before we lost weight we did n't have a life , we just sat around the house			2
we did n't really go anywhere or do anything , we did n't enjoy ourselves			0
now things are completely different			0
breakfast : porridge with berries or a full @entity234 breakfast ( grilled instead of fried ) mid-morning : a piece of fresh fruit lunch : homemade soup or jacket potato topped with beans and salad mid-afternoon : a fat - free yogurt and another piece of fruit dinner : homemade cheese burger with @entity27 - style chips ( baked in the oven ) , peas and pickles or a homemade curry with rice			2
snacks : fresh fruit , fat - free yogurts , homemade frittata , scotch eggs and onion bhajis ' my only regret is that we did n't do something sooner			0
i 'd been worried about @entity1 ' health for a long time and i dread to think how bad it might have got , but i did n't say anything because i thought it was kinder not to upset him			0
' i was completely in denial about my own weight too , but when i look back i realise how unhappy i was			0
' i would hide behind big baggy clothes and always turned down invitations to parties and events			0
we both wish we 'd been honest with ourselves and with each other			0
' we 've done it now though , and the only way is forward – after all , we 've got to make up for all the things we missed out on in our 30s and 40s			0
' @entity1 says : ' while it 's obviously not why we joined @entity27 in the first place , it 's amazing to be the @entity29			1
' going on this journey together has been so important because it 's meant we 've had the other person to bounce ideas off and support from each other , as well as from our @entity289 and the rest of the group			0
' i could n't be more proud of @entity0 and of myself , too			0
