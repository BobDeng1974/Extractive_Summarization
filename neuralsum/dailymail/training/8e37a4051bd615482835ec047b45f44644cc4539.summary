by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 18 september 2013 firemen are set to walk out across @entity2 and @entity3 for the first time in 10 years over changes to their pension scheme			0
they will strike for four hours next wednesday after almost 80 per cent of the @entity7 voted in favour of industrial action			1
the unions warned that the strike could be the first of many – with another potentially on @entity13			0
industrial action : firefighters will down tools in their first nationwide strike for a decade next week in a row over pensions although there have been local disputes in recent years , it is the first time for a decade that firemen have voted in favour of a national walkout			1
ministers insisted that contingency plans were in place , and pledged that all 999 calls would be answered			0
the service will be kept running by part - time fire crews who are not part of the @entity7			2
in some areas , trained volunteers will be called upon to help out			0
there will be no @entity36 on the streets , as in previous strikes , because since 2004 it has been the role of fire and rescue authorities rather than government to provide cover in the event of industrial action			2
most of the @entity36 – @entity47 appliances used to respond to 999 calls – have been sold to brigades in @entity49			0
dangerous : the @entity7 say that it is ' ludicrous ' to expect firefighters to work to the age of 60 before they receive a full pension ( file picture ) @entity55 , general secretary of the @entity7 , said the strike is ‘ a warning shot ’ to the government			1
‘ firefighters could not be more serious about protecting public safety and ensuring fair pensions , ’ he said			0
strike : general secretary of the @entity7 , @entity55 , said that the industrial action is a ' warning shot ' to the government the dispute centres on the pensions paid to firemen over 50 who are forced to retire early after failing to meet the required fitness standards			1
the union says thousands are threatened with the sack and paid a reduced pension simply because they are getting older			0
it wants them to be paid a full pension			1
a government review found that more than half of firefighters between the ages of 50 and 54 can not meet fire and rescue service fitness standards for fighting fires , while two thirds of those beyond the age of 55 fail to meet the standards			2
the retirement age is 60			0
the @entity7 claims that its members pay some of the highest pension contributions in the public or private sector			1
fire minister @entity93 described the strike as ‘ entirely unnecessary ’ and that ‘ robust ’ contingency plans are in place			1
‘ the pension on offer to firefighters is one of the most generous public service pensions available , ’ he said			2
‘ a firefighter who earns £ 29,000 , and retires after a full career aged 60 will get a £ 19,000 a year pension , rising to £ 26,000 with the state pension			1
‘ to get the same pension from a private scheme firefighters would have to contribute twice as much			0
’ last week , the @entity108 approved a ‘ day of action ’ on november 5			0
