the skull ( left ) belongs to one of 800 ‘ martyrs of @entity33 ’ who were executed on 14 august 1480 and has eight holes and eight partial perforations			2

‘ the skull of a person who died of violent and sudden death is better than that of a man who died of a long illness or who had been taken from a cemetery : the formers has held almost all of his spirits , which in the latter they have been consumed , either by illness or by the earth , ’ he wrote in in his book , @entity72			2

but , one of the skulls was set apart from the rest because it featured rounded holes that had been deliberately drilled into it			0
the reason for the drilling had perplexed researchers for years			2
@entity102 , professor of history of medicine and paleopathology at the @entity105 , @entity37 , noted the holes are a regular round shape			1
exactly half of them are a conical shape and the rest are partial perforations , according to the @entity113			0
professor @entity102 said : ‘ the perfectly cupped shape of the incomplete perforations leads to hypothesise the use of a particular type of trepan , with semi-lunar shaped blade or rounded bit ; a tool of this type could not produce bone discs , but only bone powder			1
’ a trepan or trephine is a surgical instrument used up to drill a burr hole into the skull in order to expose the tissue for medical reasons			0
