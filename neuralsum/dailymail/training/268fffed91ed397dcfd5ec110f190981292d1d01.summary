by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:03 est , 13 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:17 est , 13 december 2013 a woman has described how going through the menopause killed her sex life - because intercourse became so painful			1
@entity7 , 58 , says she felt so guilty that she and her husband @entity8 had n't had sex in four years that she told him to sleep with someone else			1
despite the couple always enjoying an active sex life , she says everything changed when she went through the menopause			1
@entity7 says she felt so guilty that she and her husband @entity8 had n't had sex in four years that she told him to sleep with someone else she said : ' we 've been together for 20 years and used to have a great sex life			1
when i first slept with @entity8 i 'd never had an orgasm like it before			2
' i used to say " i feel this good i could die this minute " - it could n't feel better			0
it was like that for a long time			0
' but after the menopause sex was , at first , uncomfortable			1
' then one night i just had the most horrendous pain , as if i 'd been stabbed			0
i pushed my husband off , saying " stop , go away - i ca n't enjoy sex any more "			2
' my desire has n't gone , but i 'm fearful of the pain i want my sex life back			1
i 've had 40 years of orgasms and now i 've been robbed of them			0
' the couple share their story in a new documentary on more 4 called @entity37 , which reveals that one in three women have sexual difficulties that rob them of ability to orgasm			0
because they no longer had sex , intimacy between @entity7 and @entity8 , 61 , had plummeted to an all - time low - and she confesses in the programme they are more like brother and sister			1
she adds : ' we always swore we 'd never have separate beds - but that 's not what happens			0
despite the couple always enjoying an active sex life , everything changed when she went through the menopause			1
@entity7 suffers from vaginal atrophy , or dryness , which is very common after the menopause ' we love each other dearly but the spiritual connection has vanished , that secret spark in the eye that you share			1
' i 'd like to get that sparkle back and not tears			0
' in the programme @entity7 meets @entity70 , a psychosexual therapist who regularly treats people with sex and relationship problems at her clinic in @entity75			1
@entity70 explains : ' sex seems like a luxury , so if it goes wrong , it 's the last thing that gets fixed			0
it 's not considered important enough , but when something goes wrong it can be devastating for self - esteem and confidence			0
' @entity7 is found to be suffering from vaginal atrophy , or dryness , which is very common after the menopause			1
here , the vagina shrinks and dries out , the cervix lowers and some women experience a chafing , carpet - burn feeling during sex			2
in the programme @entity7 meets @entity70 ( left ) , a psychosexual therapist who regularly treats people with sex and relationship problems a survey commissioned by the @entity98 found that 45 per cent of women who have reached the menopause had suffered from atrophy and 70 of those women said their sex life had suffered drastically as a result			1
despite being offered oestrogen cream to restore the balance of the hormone that drops after the menopause , @entity7 did n't want to pursue the @entity111 route			2
although she and @entity8 tried numerous other lubricants , nothing helped			2
over time , @entity7 backed away from @entity8 , fearing any intimacy would be leading him on - and she would n't be able to satisfy him			2
' if he got aroused i felt guilty , like i was teasing him			0
i know he is still a virile , active man and i told him to go out and have sex with someone else			2
she adds : ' but really , i know he would n't - his view is unselfish - he wants to give me pleasure			0
' @entity70 's mission is to help inject some intimacy back into the couple 's relationship			0
now , they must kiss each other hello and goodbye , have date nights , give each other 10 - minute massages and write notes to each other			0
two months later , after slow and steady progress , @entity7 and @entity8 have made it back to familiar ground for the first time in four years			1
while @entity7 no longer feels she can have penetrative sex , she and @entity8 have found other ways of keeping each other satisfied			1
@entity7 tells the camera that @entity8 has given her multiple orgasms that morning and they have ' big smiles ' on their faces			2
she adds : ' instead of thinking about my old sex like , i 'm going to focus on my new one			0
' the @entity145 is on more 4 at 10pm on monday 16 december			0

@entity7 and her husband @entity8 had always had an active sex life
but after the menopause sex became *unbearably* painful
she has vaginal atrophy , which *affects* many *postmenopausal* women
after four years , she says they had become more like ' brother and sister '
feeling guilty about not having sex , @entity7 told @entity8 to find another woman
but after relationship *counselling* , they have a good sex life again
