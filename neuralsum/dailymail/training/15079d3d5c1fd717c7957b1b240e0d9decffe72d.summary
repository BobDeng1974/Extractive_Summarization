the @entity0 said enhanced interrogations helped capture @entity2 in 2004 @entity6 's top @entity5 terrorist was captured after @entity0 spies tortured former @entity9 detainee @entity8 , it was claimed today			1
crucial information provided by mr @entity8 while he was being held helped identify ' dirty bomber ' @entity2 who was plotting terror attacks on @entity13 , according to the long - awaited publication of a report into @entity0 torture programmes in the wake of 9/11			1
the report claims that drawings by mr @entity8 – who claims to have been beaten and deprived of sleep in @entity9 – helped lead @entity5 security services to @entity2 , who had gone to ground in @entity13			1
@entity2 – also known as ' @entity23 ' or ' @entity24 ' – was tracked down in 2004 before being found guilty two years later of planning to detonate a dirty bomb and launch an attack on the @entity27			1
the revelation will prove highly controversial as it appears to contradict the findings of the @entity31 's intelligence committee report which found that the @entity0 's ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' did not yield information crucial in stopping terror attacks			1
it even stated specifically that torture techniques – including waterboarding , rectal feeding and sleep deprivation – at @entity9 were not central to @entity2 's arrest , or any other significant breakthrough			1
the report criticises the @entity0 for making ' inaccurate ' representations that ' enhanced interrogation ' was effective and necessary in producing ' otherwise unavailable intelligence '			0
it said @entity2 's arrest ' resulted from the investigative activities of @entity5 government authorities			1
after initially insisting that no representations were made to keep secret evidence about @entity5 complicity in @entity0 interrogation programmes , @entity68 yesterday changed its story			2
asked on wednesday about requested redactions , @entity75 ’s official spokesman said there had been ‘ none whatsoever , to my knowledge ’			0
but yesterday his deputy said : ‘ my understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was @entity5 involvement in any alleged torture or rendition			2
' but i think there was a conversation with the agencies and their @entity64 counterparts on the executive summary			0
‘ any redactions sought there would have been on national security grounds in the way we might have done with any other report			0
’ but the report also described how mr @entity8 not only suggested where @entity2 – an old acquaintance – might be found in @entity13 , but provided a sketch good enough to identify him , according to report footnotes revealed in the @entity104 today			1
one reference in the report states : ' while still in @entity108 custody , @entity8 provided reporting on @entity5 - based extremists in the context of terrorist training camps , including information on an individual who would play a key role in ' @entity23 's ' identification and capture			1
' in october 2003 , @entity0 officers wrote : ' our latest information , based on [ foreign partner reporting ] and a detainee 's assessment [ @entity8 in @entity64 military custody ] , is that @entity23 is believed to currently be located in @entity124 , a suburb of @entity13			1
' according to the @entity0 document , @entity8 's ' description and resulting sketch of @entity5 contact @entity129 ' – whose true identity was then unknown – ' was compared to a still shot of an unidentified man taken from a surveillance video of @entity5 extremists			1
' the comparison ' revealed that the man in the video probably [ was ] the elusive @entity129			0
' just months later , in august 2004 , @entity2 was arrested			1
mr @entity8 has also reacted furiously to the claim			2
in a letter to @entity104 last night , lawyers for mr @entity8 rejected any suggestion that he ' volunteered or co-operated in the provision of information to any intelligence service '			1
they added : ' insofar as he was tortured and under extreme and unlawful continuing duress for three - and - a - half years in @entity145 and @entity9 he , as every other individual subject to such treatment , can not be regarded in any proper sense of the words to have ' given or provided information ' voluntarily			2
' mr @entity8 was arrested in @entity108 in 2002 , and was held at @entity145 , @entity151 , before being sent to @entity9			2
he was among former detainees who received an out - of - court payment over claims @entity5 officials were complicit in his torture			2
mr @entity8 was arrested again this year – accused of attending a terrorism training camp in @entity158			0
but the charges were dropped in october after it emerged @entity161 knew of his activities			0
a parliamentary probe into the complicity of @entity5 spies in @entity64 torture programmes will not get fully under way for at least six months , it was claimed today			0
the revelation will pile further pressure on @entity75 to launch a full - judicial inquiry to get to the bottom of how much @entity173 and the @entity174 knew about @entity0 ‘ enhanced interrogation techniques ’			0
the prime minister earlier this year asked the commons intelligence and security committee to complete a probe started by former judge sir @entity179 into whether @entity5 spies and ministers turned a blind eye to the torture of detainees by the @entity0			0
that inquiry , set up in 2010 , stalled because of police investigations into the rendition of two suspects to @entity189 , before any @entity161 or @entity173 officers were questioned			0
but a member of the committee told the @entity193 it was unlikely to start examining witnesses before the general election – raising concerns that the probe has been kicked into the long grass			0
the deputy prime minister , @entity199 has said he is open to a full public inquiry into @entity5 ’s involvement in torture			0
mr @entity75 has not ruled this out if the current investigation by the @entity205 does not settle the issue .			0

information provided by @entity8 helped identify @entity2
@entity5 terrorist was plotting ' dirty bomb ' terror attack on @entity13
he was considered @entity6 's top terrorist in the @entity5 , lying low in @entity13
@entity2 , also known as ' @entity23 ' or ' @entity24 ' , was tracked down in 2004
