four out of 10 infants born in the @entity1 do not form a strong bond with either parent , and they will pay for that the rest of their lives , a new study has found			1
research from @entity9 has shown the number of babies born into families that are poorly equipped to give them a fair chance at having a successful life is alarmingly high			1
additionally , a study from the @entity17 showing that nearly one - third of @entity1 parents do n't know what to expect from their newborns , or how to help them grow and learn and get along with others			1
the main problem , according to the @entity9 study , is 40 percent of infants in the @entity1 ' live in fear or distrust of their parents ' , and that will translate into aggressiveness , defiance and hyperactivity as they grow into adults			1
it 's bonding time : a new study says not enough parents are properly bonding with their babies , which creates greater problems later in life			1
however researchers say basic bonding is simple of that number , 25 percent do n't bond with their parents because the parents are n't responding to their needs			1
some 15 percent find their parents so distressing that they will avoid them whenever possible			0
' they can overcome it , ' sociologist @entity48 of @entity9 , lead author of that study , told @entity51			1
' it 's not a make or break situation , but they might find it harder to regulate their behavior			0
' @entity48 , along with coauthors from @entity59 and the @entity60 in @entity61 , analyzed more than 100 research projects , including data collected by a @entity1 longitudinal study of 14,000 children born in 2001 , to reach their conclusions			1
while many factors contribute to the problem - including poverty , ignorance , and stress - critical bonding is simple to achieve , researchers say			1
' when a parent , most of the time , responds to a child in a warm , sensitive and responsive way - picking up the child when they cry , and holding and reassuring them - the child feels secure that they can meet their needs , ' the study notes			2
other research shows that simply touching , or caressing , a newborn is critical to the infant 's sense of security			1
the study also says that the bond can be with either parent , not necessarily both , but studies of childhood crime and risky behavior contend that for boys , the bond is more important with the father , and for girls , the bond is relatively more important with the mother			2
mother 's touch : researcher 's say that little things like sensitivity when picking up a crying child and even a soft touch makes the child feel secure nearly all of these studies are based on observation of children over an extended period of time			2
researchers usually pay more attention to the child than the parent , because the lack of a bond is more apparent in the infant			1
one innovative technique is called the ' strange situation '			0
the parent leaves the baby with a caregiver for about 20 minutes , and then either the parent or a stranger reenters the room			0
the reaction to the returning parent , compared to the arrival of a stranger , tells volumes about the relationship between parent and child			0
if a failed relationship is detected , especially when the infant is six months old or younger , the chances of helping the parent and the child form a strong bond is greatly improved , the study notes			2
the fact that damage can begin that young should be sobering to parents			0
however , often the parents most in need of help are the least likely to seek it			0
@entity48 said researchers in one study had observed 2 - year - olds over several months and were able to predict which ones would have the most trouble years later in school , based on the child 's level of poverty			1
the bond can be with either parent , but studies of childhood crime and risky behavior contend that the bond is more important with the father for boys , and for girls , the bond is relatively more important with the mother usually , it 's the mother who is the central focus of studies like these , probably because the mom is the main caregiver , especially in the early years			2
but a study at the @entity180 two years ago concluded that ' being attached to dad is just as helpful as being close to mom '			0
that is critical during the first two years of life			0
a similar study in 2012 from the @entity186 found that fathers were especially important in helping the infant avoid behavioral problems later in life			0
if the father is remote or distracted , the child is more likely to be aggressive			0
this is a problem that is not going to go away , and some percentage of parents will never be able to do a decent job because of a wide variety of reasons			0
but what all these studies show is the importance of those first few months of life , when a tiny baby is sent on a trajectory that will partly determine success at something as simple - and as critical - as getting along with others .			2

new @entity9 research shows the importance of parental bonding in the long - run
some 40 per cent of infants are living in fear or distrust of their parents because of a lack of bonding as children
poverty , ignorance and stress said to be the main factors *preventing* the bond from forming
researchers study basic bonding is simple to achieve and can come just from touching and sensitivity
it gives the child a sense of security and allows them to know their needs have been met
