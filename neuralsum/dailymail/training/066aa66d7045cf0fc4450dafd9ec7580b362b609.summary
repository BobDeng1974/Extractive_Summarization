' it is clear that anyone who stands up against the executors of the estate - @entity23 , @entity24 and their attorney @entity25 - is denied access to my mother			1
' it is my fear and belief , that they are trying to take my mother ’s life , ' he wrote			0

in her statement to @entity217 , @entity14 said she did n't want any calls during her vacation and thought she had made appropriate arrangements for her grandchildren			2
