three people have been tested for bird flu as the slaughter of 10,000 chickens begins on a farm struck by @entity6 's first outbreak of the @entity8 strain in seven years			1
officers ordered that the entire flock at the farm in @entity12 , @entity13 , be culled , and they imposed a 1km ( 0.6 miles ) exclusion zone around the site after the chickens tested positive for the strain of avian influenza			1
it is understood that three people , including an official from the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , were tested for the disease after showing symptoms but were proved to be negative			1
the outbreak was confirmed last friday following several deaths amongst the chickens , according to a source			2
it is the second outbreak of bird flu in in just four months , but this time it has been identified as the @entity50 strain , which officials insisted was ' much less severe ' than the @entity53 strain found at a @entity55 duck farm in november			1
@entity22 said there are no links between the two cases and @entity59 said the risk to public health is very low , but scientists have shown that the virus can infect humans			1
@entity8 was detected in the @entity6 in june 2008 , when egg - laying hens at a farm in @entity68 , @entity65 had to be culled			1
a spokesman from @entity22 told @entity70 that the previous case had been more serious than the current outbreak			2
all of the birds at the commercial chicken breeding farm , which has not been named , are to be slaughtered as part of action to prevent any spread of the disease a police car drives down a road closed because of a bird flu outbreak in @entity12 , as experts work to establish the source of the outbreak it is understood that three people , including an official from the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , were tested for the disease after showing symptoms but were proved to be negative there have been several outbreaks of the @entity8 flu in @entity92 and 18 months ago it was found in @entity94			1
during the @entity94 outbreak in august 2013 , three poultry workers became infected with the virus , developing conjunctivitis			0
more than 1 million chickens and other poultry were culled during the @entity94 crisis			0
tests carried out by scientists in @entity104 in 2013 revealed there was a potential risk for humans after revealing that the strain can cause severe pneumonia in ferrets			2
the exclusion zone around the farm will remain in place for at least three weeks while @entity22 officials work to establish exactly where the outbreak had stemmed from , and if it has spread			1
chief vet @entity117 said last night : ' we have taken immediate action to contain this outbreak as part of our robust procedures for dealing swiftly with avian flu			2
' this is a low severity form of the virus and we are taking action to ensure that the disease does not spread or develop into a more severe form			2
' we are investigating the possible sources of the outbreak			0
' i would urge poultry keepers in the surrounding area to be vigilant for any signs of disease and to ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises			0

pictured : an outbreak at a @entity55 farm in november the outbreak is the second of the disease to hit the @entity6 in four months , following the outbreak at a @entity55 duck farm last november ( pictured )			1
officials have insisted that the most recent case is ' much less severe ' @entity154 , director for the @entity155 and @entity156 said : ' based on what we know about this strain of avian influenza and the actions that have been taken , the risk to human health in this case is considered very low			1
' @entity59 continues to work closely with @entity22 throughout this investigation			2
' the @entity166 said there was no risk to food supplies			0
' on the basis of current scientific evidence , @entity166 advice is that avian ( bird ) flu does not pose a food safety risk for @entity6 consumers , ' a spokesman said			1
' laboratory investigations on the outbreak indicate that it is the @entity181 sub-type of @entity50 but this will need to be confirmed in further testing			0
' mp for @entity186 @entity185 said the outbreak was ' very concerning '			0
officials said the chickens at the @entity13 farm had tested positive for the @entity8 strain of avian influenza he said yesterday : ' i ’ve been liaising closely with @entity59 , based in @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity22 throughout today to ensure i ’m kept up to date with developments			1
' it appears that all precautions have taken place to ensure this problem is dealt with effectively and the experts are doing all they can to identify exactly what type of @entity50 strain it could be			0
' most importantly , i have been told that presently any danger to the public is very low and this is very welcome news			0
the strain is a mild one and is not similar to the recent outbreak at a duck farm in @entity55			2
' however , there is no doubt the authorities are taking it very seriously and regular updates will be issued in due course			0
' dr @entity217 , research associate in the @entity218 at @entity219 , said : ' if the virus is confirmed as a low pathogenic – or low severity – @entity8 avian influenza virus then the investigating authorities will try to work out where it might have come from and how it might have infected the chickens on the farm			1
it is a different subtype and severity of influenza virus from the @entity53 case last november in @entity55 so these two outbreaks are not directly linked			0
@entity59 said the risk to public health is very low			1
pictured : medication to treat bird flu strains ' low pathogenic avian flu viruses naturally infect wild birds			1
these wild birds get several influenza infections a year , often with different subtypes of influenza , and usually these wild birds do n't appear sick			0
' these wild birds also migrate and can carry their influenza viruses among geographic regions			0
' the investigating scientists will be able to compare the virus genetic material from this outbreak to influenza viruses in both wild and domestic birds , from both within and outside the @entity6 to try to work out where it might have come from			2
in the meantime , the control measures taken on the farm by the @entity6 authorities will ensure that the virus does n't mutate into something more severe and so safeguard human health			2
' the last outbreak of bird flu , which is unrelated to the current case , saw 6,000 ducks culled at a farm in @entity263 , @entity55 , involving the @entity53 strain			1
that farm was owned by @entity266 , @entity6 's biggest duck producer , which supplies ready meals to @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272			2
there have been no cases of human infection with bird flu in the @entity6			1
dr @entity276 , lecturer in @entity277 , @entity278 , said : ' @entity8 is a completely different sub-type of avian influenza a to @entity53			1
' @entity53 is relatively new , and is a hybrid ( “ re-assortant ” is the technical term ) between the old @entity284 highly pathogenic strain and an unknown other strain			0
' @entity8 on the other hand is much more familiar , and exists in two continental varieties – @entity289 and @entity290			0
' i would guess that the @entity13 strain will turn out to be a @entity290 one			0
there have been occasional infections of humans with @entity8 , most recently in @entity94 in late august 2013 , and prior to that in the @entity298 in february 2003			0
' none of these cases were severe , and all patients fully recovered			0
the virus is only transmitted from birds to humans and not from person - to - person			0
there is no danger to the general public			0
' ducks were culled at the farm in @entity263 , @entity55 , after strains of bird flu were detected @entity6 's largest duck farmer – which supplies ready meals to @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 – was at the centre of the first outbreak of bird flu in six years			1
@entity317 – which rears nearly half of the 15million ducks a year bred in the @entity6 – was forced to cull all 6,000 birds at one of its sites in @entity55 last november			0
officials imposed an ‘ exclusion zone ’ , restricting movement of poultry within six miles of the breeding farm which houses @entity329 ducks that produce eggs to be hatched for their meat			0
it came after the animals tested positive for bird flu , also known as avian flu			1
at the time , officials said the outbreak may have been be linked to a strain of avian influenza , which originated in the @entity341 and infected birds in @entity343 and the @entity298			2
it was the first serious case of bird flu in @entity6 since 2008 , when the @entity8 strain was found in free - range laying hens near @entity68 , @entity65 .			1
