by @entity0 @entity1 by @entity2 five months after @entity5 ’s father died , she found herself pacing anxiously up and down a @entity7 quayside , a cigarette in one hand , a can of @entity11 in the other , and an envelope containing £ 800 in £ 20 notes stuffed into her back pocket			1
the shy poet and historian felt like a drug dealer			2
then she saw the man she ’d come to meet , struggling with an enormous cardboard box that was lurching and thumping strangely in his arms			2
as he leaned forward to open it , she saw dried blood around a nasty gash on his wrist			2
and , suddenly , the female goshawk she had ordered burst out , in a furious clatter of wings and talons			1
author @entity5 in happier times in @entity7 with a @entity33 , the largest of the falcon species @entity5 ’s heart jumps sideways			1
to her , the bird is ‘ a conjuring trick			0
she hopes that the intense concentration required to tame such a wild creature will help cure her grief			1
bereavement happens to everyone , notes @entity5 , but you feel it alone			1
she likens it to somebody walking into a room containing your whole family , and punching each member individually , hard in the stomach			0
‘ so , the thing is , you all share the same kind of pain , exactly the same , but you ’re too busy experiencing total agony to feel anything other than completely alone , ’ she says			0
@entity5 ’s father , @entity60 , was a successful photo - journalist , ‘ a quiet man in a suit , who had set out each day in search of things that were new , who had captured the courses of stars and storms and streets and politicians ’			1
in 2007 , he set out to photograph storm - damaged buildings in @entity72 , and died of a sudden heart attack			0
the last photo on his camera is blurred , taken from a low angle , far too low , in an empty , @entity78 street			0
a young @entity79 at a parrot with father @entity60 a few days later , there ’s a strange family outing as @entity5 , her mother and brother walk the streets , looking for his car			1
they must provide his death certificate before the fine can be waived			0
this is the car she drives to @entity7 to collect her goshawk : his equipment still rattling around in the boot			1
from him , she ’s inherited her ability to wait patiently and pay attention to the details of the world around her			0
as a small child , she would hide beneath a rhododendron bush on the hill behind her house and watch the world like a tiny sniper : ‘ basking in the fierce calm that comes from being invisible , but seeing everything ’			0
@entity5 says this drive toward ‘ watching , not doing ’ has not served her well in life			1
‘ not with people and loves and hearts and homes and work			0
but in the first few days with a new hawk , making yourself disappear is the greatest skill in the world			2
’ she trained her first raptor — a kestrel called @entity122 — when she was 13 , then moved on to merlins and peregrine falcons			1
before becoming a @entity126 academic , she ’d trained birds for @entity129 sheiks			1
but she ’d always stayed away from goshawks — historically disdained by aristocratic falconers as the ruffians of the bird world , hunting in short , inelegant stabs and unfussy about their prey			0
bigger and bulkier than the sparrowhawks that snatch pigeons from suburban lawns , goshawks are the ‘ dark grail ’ of the bird - watcher ’s world			0
the pair have an unusual relationship , with @entity143 serving as the companion to her grief , @entity5 found the bird of prey to be as brutal as her emotions although gamekeepers persecuted them to extinction in the @entity154 by the end of the 19th century , they were successfully reintroduced in the @entity156			1
the females are so fearsome that breeders have to keep them in separate aviaries to the males — they will slay them if introduced at the wrong moment			0
in choosing a female goshawk as the companion to her grief , @entity5 is seeking a creature as overwhelmingly brutal as her emotions			1
but the bird she christens @entity143 turns out to be a remarkably calm hawk , settling into life in urban @entity126 with admirable ease			1
it is bizarre to picture such a cool - eyed predator taking her first meat from her new trainer in a brightly - lit lounge with ’ allo ! ’ allo ! on the television			0
although there is one terrifying scene , in which @entity143 ’s talons cause blood to gush from between @entity5 ’s eyes , the hawk also surprises the human by playing — retrieving balls of crumpled - up paper in her deadly , @entity184 - lite beak			1
@entity143 looking regal perched on @entity5 's hand the 21st - century woman ’s account of her mutually successful cohabitation with @entity143 runs parallel to her sensitive analysis of @entity191 ’s celebrated 1951 memoir @entity192			1
in that , the author of @entity194 ( the @entity196 classic disneyfied as @entity197 ) retreats with fantasies of primitive survivalism from an unhappy existence as a schoolmaster to hole up in rural isolation with a goshawk			2
while @entity5 admits she wants to learn from her hawk how to become ‘ numb to the hurts of human life ’ , @entity191 locked himself into mutually destructive battle of wills with ‘ @entity209 ’ , — replaying the shame and terror of a traumatic childhood , during which both his parents made regular threats to kill him			1
he drives himself half - mad trying to stay awake for days on end with his bird , spoils the hawk with too much meat , and tries repeatedly to break the spirit he so admires			2
he becomes his own sadistic father			2
at times , he even feels he has become a hawk			2
during one chase , his hawk grabs a rabbit , and @entity191 pins the animal ’s skull to the grass with a hunting knife			2
‘ @entity235 , ’ wrote @entity191 , who struggled to ‘ cure ’ his homosexuality with psychotherapy			0
‘ real blood - lust is like that			0
’ but for @entity5 — who understandably prefers hawk - caught meat to the flesh of sad , battery - raised animals — the kill is the point where bird and woman separate			1
‘ hunting makes you animal , ’ she writes , ‘ but the death of an animal makes you human			0
’ unlike @entity191 , she has friends and family to help her through her distress			0
she ends her exquisitely written book safe in the knowledge that her pain is a separate thing from her bird			0
@entity143 ’s talons have left thin , white scars on her hands			1
but hands , she realises , ‘ are for other human hands to hold			0
they should not be reserved exclusively as perches for hawks			0

after *losing* her father @entity60 , @entity2 buys a goshawk to help her deal with the grief
@entity5 began training @entity273 at the age of 13 and even trained birds for @entity129 sheikhs
the hawk , called @entity143 , is playful but can not be tamed
