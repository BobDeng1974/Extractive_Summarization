motoring organisations last night welcomed a city ’s ‘ bold ’ decision to scrap most of its bus lanes – and urged others to follow suit			1
@entity6 is believed to be the first local authority in the country to remove bus lanes en masse after a successful year - long trial without them			1
motoring groups welcomed the move and said they hoped it would be the start of a new trend			0
the @entity17 said all councils should now review their use of the bus - lanes so that they were used only where absolutely necessary - and not simply to punish motorists for having the temerity to use their cars			1
@entity6 is to remove nearly all of its bus lanes after a study found they were not working properly in a victory for ordinary car drivers , town hall chiefs declared the bus lanes , which prioritise passenger vehicles while restricting the amount of space left for drivers and other road users , ‘ simply do n’t work ’			1
an independent review recommending retaining just four of its 26 bus lanes was backed earlier by @entity40 ’s cabinet			1
anti-car campaigners like bus lanes because – in the transport planners ’ jargon - they ‘ deny road - space ’ to motorists , thereby artificially creating man - made traffic jams , while simultaneously allowing those in buses to get around the gridlock in their otherwise empty reserved lanes			1
this sends a less than subtle message to drivers to leave their cars behind and use public transport			0
for these very same reasons the bus lanes are loathed by drivers			1
bus lanes boomed during the last @entity61 ’s so - called ‘ integrated transport policy ’ which was dubbed a ‘ war on motorists ’ by opponents			2
the most infamous bus lane on the @entity66 into @entity67 – dubbed the ‘ @entity78 ’ because the then @entity69 ’s driver used it to speed mr @entity70 out of the gridlock from @entity72 into the capital citing ‘ security ’ reasons for the @entity76 exemption			0
it was scrapped within weeks by conservatives within the coalition government getting into power in 2010			0
only four of the 26 lanes will be saved , if the city council approves , and they could operate at different times @entity6 mayor @entity87 introduced his city ’s bus - lane free trial in september 2013			1
@entity17 president @entity90 welcomed the move in @entity6 and hoped other towns and cities would follow suit			1
he said : ‘ town halls should review where and when they operate bus lanes			2
too many of them are not working			0
they may be operating 24 hours a day when there ’s no need for it because the perceived traffic problem applies only for eight of them			0
‘ bus lanes are like yellow no parking lines			2
they are not always necessary			0
councils must review their blanket use			0
’ an @entity112 spokesman called the move ‘ bold ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s interesting to see a city the size of @entity6 taking a very different approach to congestion and if it continues to be successful may well set a precedent for other @entity121 cities to follow suit			1
’ bus operator @entity123 said it was an ‘ irresponsible ’ move which ignored the needs of ‘ thousands of bus passengers ’			0
a @entity123 spokeswoman said : ‘ it is clear that the needs of the thousands of people who rely on bus services every single day across @entity6 are not seen as a priority by the city council			0
’ she said loss of bus lanes would increase journey times , adding : ‘ we believe this is an irresponsible decision which could well come back to haunt them			2
’ the review by engineering consultant @entity140 looked at issues such as changes in bus journey times , times of non-bus passenger numbers and accident statistics			0
it examined traffic flow on three of the city ’s main bus corridors - @entity153 , between the @entity154 and @entity155 ; , @entity156 , between @entity157 and the @entity159 motorway ; and @entity160 , between @entity161 and @entity162 - where the majority of the bus lanes are placed			1
the report , which included data from researchers who travelled as bus passengers , said bus lanes only offered ‘ marginal benefits ’ along all three corridors			2
it also found that buses were slowed down by on - street parking rather than other vehicles on the road			0
to address this councillors also approved moves to study the possibility of ‘ red routes ’ to deal with ‘ indiscriminate street parking ’			0
mayor @entity87 also promised that roads where the lanes are scrapped will have better provision for cyclists			1
traffic regulation orders for the bus lanes will now be revoked with new orders introduced for the four remaining lanes .			2

city to remove nearly all bus lanes after study found they are not working
mayor @entity87 wants to ensure travel is *quick* through city for all
@entity17 delighted with change and say other cities should now follow suit
