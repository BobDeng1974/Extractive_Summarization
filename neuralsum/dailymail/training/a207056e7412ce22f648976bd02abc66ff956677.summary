by @entity0 human evolution is surging as a result of improvements to healthcare and larger populations			1
that 's according to dr @entity7 , an anthropologist at the @entity9 ’s @entity8 , who believes we are seeing a rapid rate of progress			1
but while evolution is moving quickly , dr @entity7 warned waterborne and airborne illnesses could also spread more easily as a result			1
human evolution is speeding up as a result of better healthcare , larger populations and our ever developing brains , according to dr @entity7 , an anthropologist at the @entity9 's @entity8			1

the changes of men 's beard fashions , for instance , may be guided by darwinian selection , according to a recent study			0
the more beards there are , the less attractive they become - giving men without beards a competitive advantage , scientists in @entity36 found earlier this year			0
when a ‘ peak beard ’ situation is reached , evolution favours those with beards - a trend we may be witnessing now , @entity49 researchers claim			2
‘ i invite you to look into the eyes of our ancient relatives , ’ dr @entity7 said			1
‘ why did most human ancestors go extinct , while homo sapiens survived ? the answer has a lot to do with human brains			0
’ the largest evolutionary changes have occurred in the neocortex , the area responsible for processing abstract thinking , long - term planning , empathy and language , according to @entity67			0
but while we may be evolving rapidly and spreading further around the globe , humans are also at risk of deadly parasites			2
this , dr @entity7 claims , is due to rising sea levels and less land available , along with concerns over frozen parasites being revived on @entity78			1

the more beards there are , the less attractive they become - giving men without beards a competitive advantage , scientists in @entity36 found earlier this year for example , the smallpox virus was eradicated in 1979 , according to the @entity91 , but some experts claim it has only been eradicated from the @entity78 ’s surface , surviving instead in frozen form			1
if viruses such as this survive , they could pose a threat to humanity			0

evolution is speeding up due to better *medical* care and a larger population
but despite this , dr @entity7 , an anthropologist *speaking* in @entity121 , said illnesses could spread more easily in coming years
this , she claims , is due to rising sea levels and less land available , along with concerns over frozen parasites being revived on @entity78
