' it hit so hard that four or five neighbors ' car alarms went off , ' he told @entity11			0
' it missed going through my roof by only inches and if i had stayed in the car and answered by son ’s message about picking him up , that piece of ice would have gone right through my chest			2
' @entity10 said a chunk of ice fell from a plan smashing through the windshield of his @entity12 parked at his @entity15 , @entity1 home ( above his damaged @entity12 ) he said the @entity36 did an investigation and found an @entity39 aircraft that matched within two minutes of the time the incident happened and when the plane was flying above his home mr @entity10 said two minutes later at 1.55am he called police to file the report of the ice chunk falling through his car 's windshield , which he believes came from a @entity39 aircraft			1

' the investigator can not give me the flight number but the time it happened matched within two minutes that the plane was overhead , ' he said			1
' what caught my attention was that as he turned the plane and put his spoiler down , you could hear the engine change , and i looked up and saw that it was a @entity3 plane			0
' then i heard a huge crash which sounded like a major car accident			0
' mr @entity10 said the hole in his windshield is about 12.5 inches in length and that the size of the piece of ice that went through was the size of a cinder block			1
' the pieces that broke up were the size of a grapefruit and the smaller ones were the size of golf balls , ' he told @entity11			0

' you try and stay on a budget and you find a car that you really wanted and it ’s damaged in this way			0
' my insurance says yes they ’ll fix it , but my agent explained to me what happens and told me to call @entity36 , and said if i did n’t make a claim my car would be worthless so i ’m at @entity113			1
' i do n’t know why they ca n’t admit what they did			2
' mr @entity10 said the chunks of ice ranged in size from grapefruits to golf balls ( above the chunks of ice following the incident ) he said the hole in his windshield is about 12.5 inches in length and that the glass was shattered into a fine powder mr @entity10 said that he has contacted @entity3 and the person in charge of the aircraft has not returned his calls			1

' they do n’t want to recognize it as their mistake that something happened from their plane , ' he told @entity11			0
' one of the people who did the preliminary investigation explained that if it was a part or a panel they are responsible , but ice is an " act of @entity150 " or cause of nature			1
' i said it could be a malfunction in the plane and they wo n’t recognize that or give me a call back			0
' i want them to admit that it was their fault			2
' @entity11 calls to @entity3 on friday were not immediately returned			0
mr @entity10 said he wants @entity3 to admit the chunk of ice came from their aircraft			1
on friday , he told @entity11 he had not had calls returned from the person in charge of the airbus an incident similar to @entity10 's occurred earlier this year , when large pieces of ice slammed down into a man 's @entity172 living room and bedroom , causing destruction including a massive hole in his ceiling			1

' i walked in and it looked like a bomb had exploded up in here , ' @entity178 told @entity188			0
at the time , pilot @entity189 told @entity190 that he thought the ice dropped through @entity193 ' apartment because of a plane flying overhead			1
@entity189 said : ' there ’s a slight possibility the ice - ball fell from an airplane			2
it ’s not a common occurrence but it does happen from time to time			0
' it ’s very likely that many arriving airplanes were operating in that vicinity			0
' he added : ' some airplanes use potable water to flush the lavatory toilets			0
' normally the flushed waste is collected in a storage tank but if the tank was leaking , ice could have built up on the outside of the plane and eventually broke free			0
' in january , @entity178 ( pictured above with his cat @entity180 ) experienced a similar incident when ice pummeled through his @entity172 apartment leaving his cat @entity180 scared and a massive hole in his ceiling			2
