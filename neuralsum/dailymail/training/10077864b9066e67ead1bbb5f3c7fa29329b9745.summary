' we just began mass production and we do n't expect any disruption in supplies , ' @entity28 , chief executive of @entity19 , a panel supplier for @entity12 products , told reporters in @entity35 last night			2
mr @entity28 made no mention of who the customer could be			0
his announcement came as a photo apparently showing a charge and sync cable for the new @entity3 emerged online			2
@entity12 is planning a major product launch on september 12 , stoking speculation that the world 's most valuable technology company will unveil its eagerly awaited redesigned @entity3			1
the company is rumoured to be equipping the next @entity3 with a larger screen after @entity49 unveiled its latest @entity51 smartphone with a 4.8 - inch touch - screen			0
sources have said that the panels for the new @entity3 will be 4in corner to corner - 30 per cent bigger than current iphones			1
the @entity3 screens will also be thinner than previous versions with the use of so - called in - cell panels which embed touch sensors into the liquid crystal display , eliminating the touch - screen layer found in current iphones			1
however , @entity64 reports that pundits have speculated that the revolutionary new design could lead to shortages , because the displays are harder to make			0
the new @entity3 5 ? these images purport to show the new version of @entity12 's popular smartphone earlier this week a phone company leaked what it claimed is the official front cover of @entity12 's soon - to - be - released upgrade to its @entity3 range , which appears to confirm a larger screen for the bestseller			1
phone repair shop @entity80 released two images of the ' @entity3 '			0
how it looked before : the older iphones sport a 3.5inch screen it follows rumours that the next @entity3 will be thinner than ever , with a thickness of 7.6mm , making it two millimetres thinner than the @entity88			0
@entity19 's announcement came as a single photo purporting to show a charge and sync cable for the next - generation @entity3 appeared on social messaging site @entity7			1
the cable appears to be similar to previous @entity3 cables , except of course that at one end is the notorious new smaller dock connector which will , at a stroke , make all previous @entity3 accessories obsolete			1
well - informed sources have noted that the length of the cable is different to the standard length of previous @entity106 cables , prompting speculation that this is actually a third party cable			0
the image was posted by @entity110 , a @entity111 maker of mobile phone accessories			1
it is believed the @entity3 will be announced on september 12 , with pre-orders opening immediately			0
the phone itself is expected to launch just over a week later on september 21			2
however , @entity12 fans in the @entity117 may have to wait another two weeks until october 5 before getting their hands on a phone			1
@entity12 are notoriously secretive and have not even revealed what they will call their next @entity3			2
it could be ' @entity3 ' , or it may follow this year 's spring @entity123 launch and simply be called ' the new @entity3 '			2

as well as the new dock connector , the part also seems to take in the headphone jack and the home button connector for the hotly awaited devices			0
there was an outcry when it was revealed that the next @entity3 would get a new docking port connector			0
the newer , slimline port means that thousands of current @entity12 accessories will need a potentially clunky adapter to work with the ' @entity3 ' - or their devices will become unusable			1
popular : but @entity3 users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device obsolete : the @entity167 speaker , left , and the @entity168 10 , right , are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the @entity3 leaks from the website @entity172 , which has strong sources ' close to @entity12 ' , earlier this month suggested the entire next generation of @entity177 , including the @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity133 and future versions of the @entity123 , will use the new port			2
the site believes a special connector will be released to connect older accessories - such as docking stations and speakers - to newer versions of the range			0
the ' @entity190 ' slot , containing the sim card which connects a phone to the carrier network , has also been redesigned to be thinner , although this will be unlikely to cause much disruption to users as networks will provide replacements sims if necessary .			0

screens for the new @entity3 will be thinner thanks to so - called in - cell panels which embed sensors into the display
pundits warn that the new technology could cause delays in production if they prove more difficult to make
