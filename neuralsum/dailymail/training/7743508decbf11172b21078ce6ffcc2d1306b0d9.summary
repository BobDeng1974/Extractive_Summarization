@entity29 also scored his first in the @entity16 since a long injury absence			1
it was his first since he last played @entity9 , and @entity29 weighed in on the baby theme with a thumb - sucking celebration dedicated to his niece			1
teenager @entity38 found the net , too , with his first for the club , while @entity23 grabbed the opener and @entity34 struck from the penalty spot , a goal which his fabulous performance deserved			1
there might have been more			0
twice @entity28 rattled the goal frame and @entity29 saw one ruled out for offside , all of which must have been very painful for @entity9 to witness			1
@entity103 's team have not scored in more than 10 hours , and the fact they dominated possession and missed very good chances at key moments is of little consolation			2
' we scored goals and we did n't concede , ' said @entity111			2
' our offensive game was good even though we had weaker periods when @entity9 were in possession			2
we always looked dangerous when we got through their lines			0
and we were defensively sound			0
overall , it was a positive day for us			0
' i feel a bit for @entity9			2
they were caught in last 20 minutes because they were tired			0
the second goal was a blow for them			2
but overall they did fight			0
' @entity28 have won three on the bounce in the @entity16 for the first time this season , building on the victory at @entity130			2
@entity11 , @entity29 , @entity49 and @entity46 are back after injuries , but @entity111 's decisions to bring in goalkeeper @entity133 and @entity48 , who has added bite in midfield , have provided stability in the team , together with what seems a tactical tweak to concede a little more possession and operate on the break			1
the @entity144 striker 's team - mates rush over to congratulate him after his delicate finish early in the first half @entity29 put in arguably his best performance of the season as @entity28 beat @entity9 on sunday afternoon @entity11 celebrates scoring his first @entity16 goal of the season against @entity9 in @entity151 @entity34 is congratulated by @entity152 , who won the penalty from which the @entity154 scored @entity38 , set up by compatriot @entity34 , celebrates scoring the final goal of the afternoon there was no @entity63 , who was resting a tight hamstring , but , with such an array of creative talent , @entity28 will always score goals			1
more importantly , these three wins have been achieved without conceding once			0
' we have found better consistency , ' said @entity111			0
' that will be important until the end			0
let 's show we can win more			0
confidence is higher but defensive stability vital			0
when you do n't have that you suffer			0
' it 's too early to say we are in the title race			0
we are 11 points behind			0
they need to lose four and we need to win four			0
let 's try to be consistent and see what happens			0
' when @entity29 's ambitious heel - flick cleared @entity61 and fell perfectly for @entity23 , there was a hint it might be one of those days			1
once he cleared it from under his feet , @entity23 , clipped a neat finish over the dive of @entity25			2
@entity34 thumped a low curler into a post , @entity29 was denied by a flag and @entity25 saved from @entity49			1
@entity9 steadied but were cautious			2
even on the turnover of possession , they appeared reluctant to commit anyone in support of the ball - carrier , often leaving it to the front three , who were overwhelmed			0
even so , three minutes before half - time , the visitors should have been level and would have been were it not for a fabulous save from @entity44			2
@entity9 's players look dejected after a torrid afternoon in north @entity151 that saw them concede five goals @entity23 celebrates after scoring his eighth goal of the season for the @entity31 after just eight minutes of the first half @entity69 beat @entity38 in the air to meet a cross at close range but @entity44 sprang to his left to keep it out			1
he made another fine save in stoppage time to deny @entity64 , but @entity69 ’s header was the big chance			0
score and it might change the rhythm of the game , panic @entity28 , but it was saved and within seconds @entity62 was lunging into a last - ditch tackle to avert another dangerous breakaway from @entity11			1
@entity71 missed the target as @entity9 came out for the second half with more adventure , which only made it easier for @entity28 to rip them apart on the counter-attack			1
since his players were wasteful in possession , it is easy to understand why @entity103 operates with caution			0
@entity23 supplied @entity29 for the second , who took it on at pace and applied a precision finish , and @entity11 made it three , cutting in from the left , trading passes with @entity34 and swerving his shot inside the post			1
@entity23 headed against the bar before he was replaced by @entity152 , who soon won a penalty , tumbling over @entity25 after beating the keeper to a though ball			2
@entity25 read @entity34 ’s plan to smash it down the centre and stood firm but was only able to deflect the powerful strike into the net with his left - hand			1
@entity38 slid in the fifth , a beautifully accurate side - footed finish from the edge of the penalty box			1
it was one of those days			0
@entity9 : therapy for the goalless			2
