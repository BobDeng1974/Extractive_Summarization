last season , @entity0 were top of the @entity3 on @entity4			1
this season , they are 6th			2
click here to read the five things the @entity9 need to do to reach the top four @entity11 were runners - up in the @entity3 last season , but this year they 're struggling to break into the top half			1
the sale of @entity15 and injury to @entity17 have seen them struggle to score goals , and defensive troubles have left them leaking goals			0
after 17 games last season , @entity11 were top of the @entity3 with 36 points			1
now , they are 10th with 22			0
here , @entity26 look at the five things they need to do to right their wrongs , and climb into the top four of the @entity3			1
send for @entity29 @entity11 have a nine - point gap to make up if they want to gatecrash the @entity32 placings and for that they need goals and more goals			1
it is hardly rocket science to suggest a return to fitness for striker @entity17 would make a huge difference to a squad desperately short of forwards			0
he scored 24 times for @entity11 last season , remember			1
@entity17 ’s arrival would provide a psychological boost and surely @entity47 will be especially delighted to have someone to provide the finishing touches to his runs and crosses			0
@entity17 has struggled with injury , but @entity11 desperately need him back in the @entity53 make history @entity11 have 22 points from 17 games this season			1
no side with that total has finished higher than sixth in @entity3 history			2
boss @entity61 said after the draw against @entity0 on sunday that a similar run to last year ’s 11 wins on the spin could do it			1
@entity11 are tenth , seven points above the relegation zone			1
they may be going in the right direction but that is a lot of catching up to do			0
for a period on sunday , it looked like @entity11 would kick - start their season - now they need to make history sign a cech @entity78 has been taken out of the firing line after his error - strewn season but @entity81 is only ever going to be an interim measure			1
@entity61 needs an experienced , reliable stopper between the posts and if @entity78 does not get his confidence back , then it might be worth a punt for someone in january , even on loan			0
so how about @entity90 , currently no 2 to @entity91 at @entity92 ? @entity61 and @entity93 are mates , after all			0
@entity90 is no 2 to @entity91 at @entity92 - perhaps @entity11 could sign him in january ? find a winning formation @entity61 has tweaked and fiddled this season , partly out of necessity and partly because most of his summer signings have struggled one way or the other			2
has he accidentally stumbled on a winning formula with 3 - 4 - 3 ? stacking midfield seems to suit @entity103 and it also gives @entity105 a bit more room for manoeuvre , although it does put the defence under pressure			0
@entity111 was hardly mr @entity112 against @entity0 while @entity113 is off to the @entity114 , which suggests @entity61 may have to get that chalkboard out again			2
@entity11 manager @entity61 is under pressure to find a winning formation for his team @entity119 buoyant despite mistakes discover the @entity121 anyone who saw @entity124 play for @entity125 and then for @entity11 would struggle to believe it was the same player			2
the central defender has been a mistake waiting to happen since his summer move but this is someone who is usually comfortable on the ball and , in theory , perfectly qualified to slot into a 3 - 4 - 3			0
the groin injury he picked up on @entity138 duty could turn out to be a blessing in disguise			0
it gives him a chance to re-group , which should be to @entity11 ’s gain because he is a class act			2
@entity124 suffered an injury in the cup , but his performances on the pitch have left a lot to be desired @entity150 here to @entity153 's facebook page .			0
