@entity1 parents are choosing increasingly unusual names for their children - including @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			1
national records for 2014 show thousands of babies are now the only person in the country to have their name			1
the trend for calling youngsters something completely unique has led to some bizarre examples , such as @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
babies in the @entity1 are increasingly being given unique names including @entity22 , @entity4 , @entity7 and @entity5 ( file picture ) the number of unique names chosen last year topped 4,800 and accounted for nearly two - thirds of the total number of names			1

a boy was also called just the letter 'm ' while others were named @entity41 and @entity42			0
the names of footballers also proved popular with one boy being called @entity22 after the @entity48 @entity47 player and others called @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			2

records show the trend for one - off names led to more than 4,800 unique children 's names last year @entity96 , of @entity97 , the @entity1 's largest parenting club , said : ' celebrities like the @entity100 are renowned for choosing unusual names for their off - spring and today 's parents are quick to follow a trend in a bid to make sure their choice of baby names stands out from the crowd			1
' but baby name trends can change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom			2
' just a couple of years ago @entity112 and @entity113 were pretty uncommon as a baby girl 's name , yet now they regularly feature in the top ten			0
' likewise for boys , a decade ago the names @entity119 and @entity120 were rarely considered , but nowadays parents look beyond previously traditional biblical names like @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
' whilst certain baby names can quickly rise to fame they can just as easily fall from favour			0
take @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 for example , now that they are more common in classrooms across the country they no longer make the grade for new parents who want a name that no other child is likely to have in the playground			0
