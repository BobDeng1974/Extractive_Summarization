security at the wing is second only to the notorious ‘ @entity65 ’ wing - where the most dangerous inmates are held			1
@entity25 is currently on trial at the @entity33 in @entity34 for alleged kidnapping and torture , but is being held in @entity38 as he is considered a high security risk prisoner			1
@entity38 was the execution site of dozens of black political activists by @entity56 's white - only apartheid government , which ended with the election of @entity74 in 1994			1
it is now the home of apartheid death squad leader @entity77 , known as ' @entity79 ' , and is known for a vicious gang culture			2
the correctional services department on monday denied that it was making arrangements in advance of @entity1 ’ sentencing tomorrow			1
lock up : @entity38 was the execution site of dozens of black political activists by @entity56 's white - only apartheid government			1
now it is home to the apartheid death squad leader @entity77 killer : @entity1 , right , pictured in november 2012 with girlfriend @entity88 , who he shot dead in their home in @entity38 while she was locked in the toilet , saying that he mistook her for a possible intruder @entity93 , who prosecuted @entity1 for the murder of 29 year old @entity95 , told judge @entity96 that the idea of the athlete serving his sentence at home under ' correctional supervision ' with an order to carry out community service , was ' shocking inappropriate ' for the severity of the crime he had committed			1
he said the double amputee ’s disability should not be taken into consideration when he is sentenced and called for a minimum of ten years behind bars			2
the trial of @entity25 is one of the most high profile and high security @entity56 has ever seen			1
the fugitive arrived in @entity56 on a fake passport and since then a number of his business rivals and associates have died in mysterious circumstances , including @entity124 super car conversion specialist @entity122 and the owner of a string of strip clubs , ‘ @entity128			2
the special arrangements come after @entity1 's legal team told the court their client faces threats from a ruthless prison gang leader is he is given preferential treatment in jail			1
@entity137 - known as @entity138 - said he would order ' a hit ' on the double - amputee if his fame and wealth bought him an easy time behind bars			2
defence lawyer @entity40 quoted the claims from a newspaper article to argue that the athlete 's life would be at risk if he was jailed for killing his girlfriend @entity88			0
@entity1 talks to his lawyer @entity40 on day four of his sentencing hearing at the @entity33 in @entity38 emotional : the athlete 's sister , @entity153 , wipes tears from her eyes next to her aunt @entity157 while listening to testimony from miss @entity88 's cousin , @entity159 , during the sentencing hearing if he is jailed , it was thought the paralympian could have been sent to @entity165 prison in @entity38 , where feared gangs are notorious for turning new inmates into sex slaves in exchange for protection			1
mr @entity40 said @entity137 , the head of the feared 26s gang who claims to control all of @entity56 's inland jail , made his threats in an interview from a prison phone box			0
@entity137 said : ' if he thinks he is going to come here and buy his way to get computers and cellphones and a lavish lifestyle , he must know that will never happen for as long as i am around			0
' the criminal kingpin , who has been in and out of prison for the past 33 years , admitted he had organised similar retribution on other prisoners who had received special care , including the killer of @entity190 - a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle			1
the revelations came after miss @entity88 's cousin made a dramatic appeal for @entity1 to be sent to prison , telling the court that he ' needs to pay for what he 's done ' to her family and his own			1
prison life in @entity56 is characterised by an elaborate system of gangs , through which much prisoner - on - prisoner violence is mediated , a report by a human rights group has found			0
while gang activity is common to many prison systems , @entity56 prison gangs are distinctive			0
most importantly , they have a national organisation			0
as such , a gang member who is transferred from one prison to another , or even released and re-imprisoned , will keep his membership and gang rank in the new prison			0
stark conditions : prisoners are lined up inside the @entity218 during a surprise raid by prison officials checking for drugs and other contraband			0
the jail is the most likely one that @entity1 will be sent to if he is given a prison term for killing his girlfriend @entity88 the gangs have a history that predates the formation of the @entity56 prisons department			1
they are not spontaneous creations in each prison , with an improvised system of membership and command			0
they instead have an elaborate structure , ranking and disciplinary code that mimics the militaristic structures of the @entity56 apartheid system in general and the prison administration in particular			0
the three predominant gangs operating in @entity56 's prisons today are the 28s , 27s and 26s , known collectively as the ' number gangs '			0
the ' number gangs ' trace their origins , by an elaborate oral history , to the late 19th century , when gangs were formed in the all - male compounds occupied by migrant laborers working in the mines on the @entity256 , near @entity34			2
@entity257 : the athlete 's lawyer has argued that there will be a risk from prison gangs if he is sent to jail a report by @entity265 found that promotion is gained by carrying out acts of violence on non gang members or rivals the 28s are said to be the most feared , operating an organised system of ' wyfies ' - or sexual partners			0
the 26s are known for skill at obtaining contraband items , while the 27s enforce the codes of the other two groups			0
inmates who are not associated with a gang complain of having to ' buy ' back their own bunk from gang members and have other possessions confiscated			0
and any attempts to disrupt the structure of gangs often leads to warfare within the gang and with rivals			0
most worryingly , warders often turn a blind eye to gang activities and in some cases , actively collaborate with them .			0
