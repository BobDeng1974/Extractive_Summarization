who do @entity1 dream of sitting next to at 30,000feet ? the royal family , @entity3 and @entity4 top the list according to a new survey commissioned by @entity7			1
@entity8 proved the favourite royal of those questioned , followed by @entity11 , whose potential for in - flight banter was no doubt what pipped his brother @entity16 to the post for second place			1
the @entity19 herself came in third			0
13.5 % of people would most like to fly alongside the royal family , with @entity8 in the number one spot and prince @entity16 in third place a host of celebrities fill the remainder of the top ten famous faces that would fill a fantasy flight			1
a-list stars of days gone by , including @entity32 and @entity33 featured highly stealing more than 12 per cent of the vote each , while @entity35 shared fourth place with the very much alive @entity3 , who won 11.1 % of the vote			1
swoon in the sky : 7 % of passengers asked would like to fly next to @entity41 , making him the 9th most popular celebrity , while 6.5 % put @entity4 in 10th place @entity41 and @entity4 , who were in ninth and tenth place , with 7 % and 6.5 % of the vote respectively , also made the grade			2
and passengers who do n't win any friends in the skies ? a bad smell is the least attractive quality to @entity1 people with 48.2 % of those surveyed citing a companion ’s bad body odour as their number one gripe			1
however , it seems us @entity59 are the least concerned about a stinky seatmate when it comes to our @entity64 cousins			2
70 % of @entity66 participants admit they ca n’t bear @entity67 along with 64 % for the @entity68 , 61 % of @entity69 and 53 % of @entity71 passengers			0
it ’s no great shock that notoriously prudish @entity1 list canoodling as an in - flight annoyance with 5.2 % of people saying they would n’t like to sit next to an amorous couple on an aeroplane			2
surprisingly though , passion - loving @entity69 are with us on that one , with 5 % saying no way to wandering hands in the next seat , while the @entity66 and @entity68 remain non-plussed by in - flight naughtiness			0
it was n't just today 's celebrities who were on the top ten fantasy passenger list : @entity32 and @entity33 made it on there along with @entity86 and @entity35 unsurprisingly , most people asked were reasonably irked by children kicking the back of their seat , but it ’s the @entity1 and @entity71 who have the least tolerance with as many as 20 % and 27 % respectively expressing a dislike of children putting the boot in			1
if you do find yourself travelling with a child , perhaps hope to sit them behind someone @entity66 , as they were the least bothered with only 11 % complaining			0
‘ when 30,000ft up in the sky , we get pretty up close and personal with our fellow passengers and if you ’re sitting next to somebody you ’re not keen on it can make for a long flight ’ , a spokesperson for @entity7 , which commissioned the survey , said			0
‘ consider those around you , make sure you ’re smelling fresh , do n’t fall asleep and keep chewing to a minimum , ' was the sage advice offered .			0
