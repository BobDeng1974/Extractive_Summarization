reclusive billionaire @entity10 was a keen squash player whose injury sent him into retail , leading him to create one of @entity74 's most successful companies			1
ranked as the 15th richest person in @entity74 with a £ 1.5bn fortune , he rarely gives interviews and is only seen publicly when watching @entity78 , the football club he owns			1

its young customers have been hit hard by the downturn but the firm , which is predominantly based in the north of @entity157 , has also been slow to join rivals with a meaningful website			0
it came as the true scale of the devastation wreaked on the @entity74 @entity163 was laid bare yesterday as it was revealed that the number of store closures skyrocketed last year			0
a total of 7,300 high street shops closed down in 2012 , a net loss of 1,800 - compared with just 174 the year before			0
while most attention was focussed on the troubles of a few high - profile firms , the real damage was done by profitable businesses seeking to cut costs by trimming the number of stores			2
a new report on @entity74 's 500 largest town centres by @entity179 and the @entity180 showed that an average of 20 stores closed every day			2
success : @entity2 's share price is up a pound in six months - but down slightly today - as they continue to hoover up failing businesses and turn them round crisis : @entity163 vacancies have remained strikingly high since the start of the recession desolate : @entity74 's @entity193 had 1,800 fewer stores at the end of last year as businesses shut down outlets the squeeze on @entity163 chains is of course closely linked to the double - dip recession , but they are also under pressure from the relentless rise of online shopping			1
last year saw well - known businesses such as @entity207 and @entity33 sports cease operations , but even healthy firms closed branches in an attempt to keep costs down			1
