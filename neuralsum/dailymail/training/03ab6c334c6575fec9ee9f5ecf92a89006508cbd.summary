singer @entity0 appeared to have had a @entity2 - style makeover before she arrived at court in central @entity4 this morning to face a drugs charge			1
the 25 - year - old singer strode into @entity7 in sky - high heels , coiffed blonde ringlets and full war - paint before denying one charge of supplying @entity13 drugs			1
the @entity15 star , of @entity16 , north @entity4 , is accused of setting up an £ 860 deal to sell 13.9g of cocaine to an undercover reporter			1
she appeared alongside rapper @entity20 , real name @entity21 , 35 , of @entity23 , north @entity4			1
he too denied a charge of supplying the drug			1
celebrity chef @entity28 looked strikingly elegant when she arrived at @entity29 earlier this month for the trial of her assistants , @entity32 and @entity33 @entity0 , who wore tight black trousers , a black top and black jacket , was forced to disclose her address to the court after her solicitor applied for it to be withheld to prevent ' unwanted visitors '			1
but chief magistrate @entity41 ruled ' the address must be given ' after considering the application with representations from prosecutor @entity45 and members of the @entity47			0
the singer told the court : ' just to let you know , after it being read out , in the next month or so i might have to move to a new address			0
' the court heard how the charge relates to 13.9g of cocaine - dubbed ' white sweets ' by @entity0 as a codename for the powder when talking to mr @entity59			1
@entity45 , prosecuting , said : ' this was an investigation carried out by an investigative journalist at the @entity64 newspaper			0
' on the march 28 , @entity59 met @entity0 under the pretense of her playing a role in a forthcoming film			2
' there was no reference to drugs in that meeting			0
he again met her later on may 10 at a hotel in @entity4			2
holding her head up : just like @entity28 did two weeks ago , @entity0 made sure she looked her best defiant : the singer appeared outside court with her solicitor @entity76 after denying the drugs supply charge fellow defendant : rapper @entity21 , 35 , aka @entity20 , arrived at court to deny one drugs charge court sketch of @entity83 , aka @entity20 , and @entity0 in the dock at @entity7 ' during the course of the conversation , @entity0 offered to supply cannabis and then cocaine to mr @entity59			1
' she said she would use a code over the telephone , referring to cocaine as white sweets			0
' there was a series of recorded phonecalls			0
' on may 21 , mr @entity59 called @entity0 and said he would be in @entity4 and could she get him white sweets and she confirmed she could			1
' on may 22 , she arranged a table at a club called @entity98			0
' she then said she would text mr @entity59 a number of a good friend of hers who would provide her with the sweets			0
' that was the last contact he had with @entity0			2
he then telephoned the number provided and spoke to a gentleman called mr @entity21			2
' [ caption going , going ... with large strides and an almost military swing of the arms , @entity0 tried to look in command of the situation as she ran the gauntlet of photographers the court heard that @entity83 arranged to meet the journalist to supply the cocaine at the @entity117 hotel , where the meeting was covertly recorded			1
committing the case to trial at @entity121 , district judge @entity41 said : ' this matter is not suitable for a summary trial and is too serious to be dealt with at the magistrates ' court and will be sent to the crown court			0
' ' this matter is too serious to be dealt with at the magistrates ' court and will be sent to the crown court			0
' - district judge @entity41 @entity21 , who wore a blue jumper and black jeans to attend court , is accused of supplying the drug on may 23			1
@entity0 , who was initially arrested in connection with the incident with @entity21 on june 4 , was officially dropped as a judge on @entity136 days before her arrest , with @entity138 returning to the show in her place			1
the pair , who were given unconditional bail by mr @entity41 , will next appear at @entity121 in central @entity4 on january 14			2
the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) announced last week that it had authorised the @entity145 to charge the former x factor judge with ' being concerned in ' the supply of @entity13 drugs			1
@entity150 chief crown prosecutor @entity149 said : ' we have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest			0
' @entity0 denied the charge and will now appear at @entity121 on january 14 next year different styles : @entity21 arrived for his court appearance in trainers , jeans and a blue cardigan , while @entity0 clearly decided the occasion called for a more glamorous look low - cut top : @entity0 chose an outfit with a plunging neckline			1
even though @entity2 's curves are more famous , she chose to cover up for her day in court last week @entity0 ' lawyer , @entity171 , said that his client had joined a line of celebrities who had been used as ' fodder by greedy newspapers '			0
he said : ' this was a deliberate attempt to target a young woman , who is all the more vulnerable because of her celebrity status			0
' @entity0 was initially arrested in connection with the incident with @entity21 on june 4			1
she was officially dropped as a judge on @entity136 days before her arrest , with @entity138 returning to the show in her place			0
a @entity64 spokesman defended the article , adding : ' @entity64 on sunday 's investigation into @entity0 was entirely justified in the public interest			0
' ms @entity0 is a self - described role model for young people and therefore has certain responsibilities			1
' throughout our investigation , our team followed the @entity196 and then handed over our dossier of evidence to the police			0
' @entity0 might have taken some style tips from @entity2 ’s courtroom makeover , including wearing head - to - toe black , applying heavy make - up and tilting her chin just so , but the singer seems to have missed a few key points from the power dressing memo			1
while @entity2 buttoned up in a high - necked shirt and smart coat , @entity0 is showing off more cleavage than she ever did as an @entity212 judge			2
she has carefully chosen an all - black outfit and ditched any attention - grabbing accessories but her choice of low - cut top is more distracting than any jewellery she could have worn			0
@entity219 fashion choice : the ensemble looked suitably sombre for the occasion - except for @entity0 's hot pink nail varnish and £ 500 @entity224 stiletto 's , which made it look like she was rushing off to a nightclub yes , there is a 28 - year age gap between the two women , and @entity0 is a young women with a very different style than the 53 - year - old chef			2
but @entity2 ‘ s curves are far more famous than 25 - year - old @entity0 ’s and she still managed to restrain them for the sake of a court appearance			1
in fact @entity2 was very careful not to show any skin at all , choosing boots and thick tights for her legs , while @entity0 has decided to flash some ankle ( a brave choice in december ) and could n’t resist wearing a pair of high - end , highly expensive stilettos			2
no doubt @entity0 thinks her £ 500 @entity248 make her look steely and serious , but in reality they make her look like she ’s ready to bundle into a cab and head to g.a.y. the minute the proceedings are over			0
her perfectly curled hair extensions and bright pink nails also jar with the sombre style she is trying to channel by wearing a smart black blazer and tailored trousers			0
but @entity0 does win style points for her make - up , copying her unlikely fashion inspiration @entity2 with a strong brow and nude palette			2

@entity0 , 25 , turned up with full war - paint , heels and blow - *dry*
@entity271 denied one charge of being concerned with supply of @entity13 drugs
rapper @entity21 , 35 , aka @entity20 , also denied supplying drugs
