from @entity5 lightweights to @entity7 heavyweights , the transformation in some of @entity3 football 's most disappointing imports has been quite remarkable			1
from @entity9 to @entity10 , @entity11 to @entity12 , these players have swapped anonymity in the @entity3 winters for dancing to the @entity15 beat on the grandest stage of all at the @entity7			2
@entity17 – @entity18 signed for £ 10.6million in 2011 , the @entity20 playmaker was jeered off the field against @entity22 three years - and just eight goals – later			1
the forward ’s fleetness of touch has never been in doubt and his flicks and tricks have , on occasion , drawn gasps of wonder from the @entity34 crowd but his inability to produce consistently led @entity37 supporters to view @entity17 as a scapegoat as the club ’s form disintegrated under @entity41			1
loaned out to @entity42 in january and now likely to move on permanently following @entity37 ’s relegation			1
magic moment : @entity37 's @entity17 scored @entity18 's winner against @entity46 last week @entity47 – @entity48 @entity47 was signed on loan in january by @entity51 manager @entity50 but made just five appearances , with the @entity51 losing four of those assignments			1
the @entity7 , though , has been a different story for @entity47 , with the full - back embracing @entity48 ’s high - tempo , attacking football , opening the scoring in the win over @entity60 and impressing once more in the victory over the @entity62			1
getting forward : ex-west @entity51 loanee @entity47 scored @entity48 's opener in their 3 - 0 win against @entity60 @entity68 - @entity67 just as @entity70 though his reputation could barely take any more blows to the system , along comes @entity68 , the youngster that the former @entity22 manager released on a free transfer after handing him just one appearance as a substitute for @entity77 during a @entity79 match against @entity80			1
@entity68 joined @entity81 from @entity82 in 2009 but did not appear in the @entity5 and was released in 2012 , joining @entity83 , where the defender has flourished , culminating in a @entity7 place and a second - half substitute appearance against @entity87 in the 2 - 2 draw on saturday evening			1
world stage : @entity68 ( bottom ) was let go by @entity81 but came on for @entity67 against @entity87 @entity91 – @entity92 signed by @entity50 for @entity9 at the age of 20 , the @entity94 midfielder arrived at the @entity96 with great expectations but was immediately set back by a serious knee injury and made just one appearance for the club in a 2008 home defeat inflicted by @entity102			1
the midfielder , though , managed to reinvent his career in @entity46 , enjoying spells with @entity105 , @entity106 and now , @entity107 , where he made 28 appearances last season			0
his wonderful free - kick in the 5 - 2 defeat by @entity113 remains the only direct free - kick to be scored in @entity115 so far			0
revival : @entity91 scores for @entity113 against @entity118 but was unsuccessful at @entity9 @entity120 - @entity119 the self - anointed ‘ pitbull ’ lost his bite as @entity122 meekly surrendered to relegation under @entity124 but in the colours of @entity119 , @entity120 has been a @entity126 at the heart of a back three , anticipating danger and using the ball with composure and accuracy			1
@entity122 can expect plenty of interest both at home and on the continent – @entity137 are keen - for one of the most impressive defenders on show in @entity115			2
chairman @entity141 is determined not to make a loss on a player who cost an initial £ 10million to the @entity145 club , with wages in the region of £ 35,000 - a - week			0
key man : @entity122 's @entity120 has helped @entity119 reach the last 16 after being relegated with the @entity145 club @entity149 – @entity115 a relic from the days of @entity152 ’s kamikaze spending , the £ 19million @entity149 struggled to make an impact in the @entity5 after signing from @entity154 , scoring just thirteen goals in three seasons at @entity152 - a period which also included loan spells with @entity81			1
a return to his homeland with @entity162 and @entity163 has resurrected his international career , although it is admittedly helped by the paucity of options available to @entity115 in the forward positions			2
yet to start at a game at the @entity7 but did appear to represent an upgrade on @entity170 when he came on against @entity171			0
surprise inclusion : @entity149 flopped at @entity152 and @entity81 but has seen some action for host nation @entity115 @entity175 - @entity174 in @entity174 , they call him @entity178			0
at @entity180 , they sing : ‘ we ’re calling him @entity181			0
’ the @entity183 locals will be shaking their heads at the man who scored one goal in seventeen appearances since signing for @entity180 in january , and then headed to @entity115 to terrorise @entity189 ’s superstars in a scarcely believable performance of courage , organisation and quality by @entity174			2
finding his form : @entity180 striker @entity195 almost got on the score - sheet against @entity189 for @entity174 @entity197 – @entity115 a @entity199 winner with @entity200 , @entity197 was actually one of @entity202 ’s most impressive performers in that wretched campaign that saw their frenetic approach to the transfer market result in relegation			0
loaned out to @entity209 side @entity207 to offset the club ’s spiralling wage bill			0
from relegation at @entity213 to @entity7 glory in the @entity215 - via a pit stop in @entity207 - would make for quite the 18 months			2
safe hands : @entity218 goalkeeper @entity197 , pictured here in action against @entity171 , was frozen out at @entity202 @entity221 – @entity171 recruited with the reputation of being one of @entity225 ’s most exciting young talents , @entity221 failed to live up to expectations at @entity227 , completing ninety minutes on just six occasions in between loan spells with @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232			0
it would be an exaggeration to say that @entity221 has set this @entity7 alight for @entity171 but he has forced the prolific @entity235 out of the starting line - up , who boasts 35 goals in 64 starts for @entity171			2
the @entity22 striker 's record of an international goal every 1.83 games is better than that of @entity245 ( goal every 2.3 games ) and @entity248 ( goal every 2.2 games )			0
on the run : @entity221 ( right ) endured a difficult time at @entity227 but is a key player for @entity171 @entity254 – @entity62 it is quite difficult to believe that @entity254 - who glided and tricked his way past a host of @entity259 defenders to score one of the individual goals of the tournament against the @entity62 - is the same @entity264 flop that scooped an open goal over the crossbar on a freezing december night at @entity267 just 18 months ago			1
a fine season for @entity269 has been followed by two goals in two games in @entity115			0
maybe the winger had a point when he commented earlier this year : ‘ the fundamental difference between the @entity269 and @entity264 is the coach			0
@entity277 here gives me confidence , i know that he believes in me			0
what i learned at @entity264 ? honestly , not so much , because you can not learn a lot if you 're on the bench			0
’ stunner : former @entity264 man @entity254 scored a fine solo goal in the @entity62 's defeat to @entity48			1

@entity37 forward @entity17 was sent out on loan in january but has been in fine form for @entity18
@entity68 was released by @entity81 but came on for @entity67 against @entity87
former @entity264 man @entity254 scored one of the goals of the @entity7 for @entity62 against @entity48
@entity120 has helped @entity119 reach the last 16 after relegation with @entity122
