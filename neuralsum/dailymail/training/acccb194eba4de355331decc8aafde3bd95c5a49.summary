by @entity0 fearing its latest round of bonuses would create negative headlines and trigger a backlash , @entity1 decided to act			1
but rather than rein in fat - cat remuneration , it came up with a novel way to head off public anger – turn off televisions in branches so customers could n’t watch the news			1
earlier his week @entity1 announced that 500 super-rich bankers pocketed at least £ 1million each last year			1
one of the many branches that will have been told to turn tvs off so that customers do n't see the news about the head of their bank getting a £ 950,000 share remuneration ( which some are calling disguised bonuses ) concerned about ‘ negative coverage ’ it urged staff in its high - street branches to turn over from news channels and , in a last resort , to unplug the screens			1
last night bank bosses denied they had made a direct instruction to change the channels but spoke of their regret over the memo in which the ploy was outlined			2
the memo read : ‘ it ’s likely there will be some media interest			0
' we ’d like to give you the heads up so you can change the channel in your branch to support colleagues in the event there is negative coverage			0
@entity1 customers have been complaining about the revelations , with some saying they were ' stunned and outraged ' it recommended a couple of channels , adding ‘ as a last resort find the power source and turn off the tv ’			1
yesterday customers at @entity1 said they were ‘ stunned and outraged ’ by the directive and accused the bank of trying to mask a fat cat culture			1
customer @entity62 , 24 , of @entity63 said : ‘ it ’s shocking that they would issue a memo which set out to deceive their own customers			0
’ another customer said : ‘ it ’s astonishing			0
many people who bank with @entity1 will be outraged			2
it is absolutely stunning really			0
' they have obviously learnt that customers find these bonuses unacceptable so their solution it – keep it from the customers			2
’ @entity1 ’ annual report , released this week , also revealed that chief executive @entity81 will be paid £ 950,000 in share allowances on top of his normal salary and bonuses – taking his potential remuneration to £ 6.3million			1
mr @entity81 said the controversial decision to increase bonuses by £ 200m in 2013 despite profits falling had to be made or the investment division would suffer			2
last night a spokesman for @entity1 said : ‘ the tv screens in our branches are tuned to one channel , typically news			1
some branch staff asked whether they could change the channel if they felt the programme unsuitable			0
‘ we encourage our staff to use their discretion and confirmed that they could do so			0
we did not direct colleagues to change the tv channel			0
