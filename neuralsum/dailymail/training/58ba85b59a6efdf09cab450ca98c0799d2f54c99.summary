plants use a newly discovered ' language ' to ' speak ' to each other , research has revealed			0
the finding opens the door to a new area of science that explores how plants communicate with each other on a molecular level			2
it could also give scientists new insights into how to fight parasitic weeds that devastate food crops in some of the poorest parts of the world			1
plants use a newly discovered ' language ' to ' speak ' to each other , research has revealed			0
they studied the molecular communication between a parasitic plant called dodder , and two host plants , @entity27 ( pictured left ) and tomatoes ( pictured right ) professor @entity29 , an expert in plant pathology , physiology and weed science at @entity33 , said : ' the discovery of this novel form of inter-organism communication shows that this is happening a lot more than any one has previously realised			1
' now that we have found that they are sharing all this information , the next question is , " what exactly are they telling each other ? " ' professor @entity29 examined the relationship between a parasitic plant called dodder , and two host plants , @entity27 and tomatoes			1
in order to suck the moisture and nutrients out of the host plants , dodder uses a root - like appendage called a haustorium to penetrate the plant			1
professor @entity29 has previously discovered that during this parasitic interaction , there is a transport of @entity61 between the two species			0
the research could give scientists new insights into how to fight parasitic weeds that devastate food crops in some of the poorest parts of the world and in extreme cases lead to famine ( illustrated with a stock image ) @entity74 acid ( @entity61 ) is a family of large biological molecules that code and decode information passed down from its dna			1
his new work expands the scope of this exchange and examines the @entity84 , or messenger @entity61 , which sends messages within cells telling them which actions to take , such as which proteins to code			2
professor @entity29 has previously discovered that during this parasitic interaction , there is a transport of @entity61 ( illustrated ) between two species			0
it was thought that @entity84 was very fragile and short - lived , so transferring it between species was impossible			2
but professor @entity29 found that during this parasitic relationship , thousands upon thousands of @entity84 molecules were being exchanged between both plants , creating an open dialogue between the species that allows them to freely communicate			1
through this exchange , the parasitic plants may be instructing the host plant to lower its defences so that they can more easily attack it			1
professor @entity29 's hopes to discover precisely what the @entity84 are ' saying '			2
his findings , published in the journal , @entity109 , will be able to examine if other organisms such a bacteria and fungi also exchange information in a similar fashion			0
they could also help solve issues of food scarcity			0
commenting on the research , in which she was not involved , @entity118 , a professor at @entity119 , said : ' parasitic plants such as witchweed and broomrape are serious problems for legumes and other crops that help feed some of the poorest regions in @entity129 and elsewhere			2
' in addition to shedding new light on genetic interactions , professor @entity29 's findings have exciting implications for the design of novel control strategies			0
for example , armed with this new knowledge , scientists could engineer plants that could combat against the @entity84 information that the parasite uses to disrupt its host			1
' professor @entity29 added : ' the beauty of this discovery is that this @entity84 could be the achilles heel for parasites			0
' this is all really exciting because there are so many potential implications surrounding this new information			0

an expert at @entity33 found a form of inter-organism communication
he studied the relationship between a parasitic plant and two host plants and found that @entity84 molecules were being exchanged between the plants
the parasitic plant may have been instructing the host to lower its defences
finding could give scientists new insights into how to fight parasitic weeds that devastate food crops in some of the poorest parts of the world
