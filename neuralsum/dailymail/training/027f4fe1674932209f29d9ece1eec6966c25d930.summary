by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 06:44 est , 29 november 2012 a dentist is facing up to five years in jail after she admitted sending a text message at the wheel as she knocked down and killed a dog - walker			1
@entity6 , 45 , had pulled over in a lay - by to compose the message on her mobile phone but had set off again by the time she pressed ‘ send ’			1
as she did so , she ploughed into @entity10 , 60 , a grandfather who was walking his @entity12 terrier , @entity13			1
@entity6 , left , knocked down and killed @entity10 , right , while sending a text message in june last year both mr @entity10 and his dog were then hit again by the car behind @entity17			1
mr @entity10 was taken by air ambulance to hospital but died later			0
@entity17 , who works as a dentist at a practice near @entity23 , had been facing a charge of causing death by dangerous driving – which carries a maximum 14 - year prison sentence			2
but on the day she was due to stand trial by jury , lawyers allowed her to plead guilty to the lesser charge of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving			2
the charge carries a minimum sentence of 15 months and a maximum of five years			0
last night the family of the victim were too upset to speak about the tragedy			0
' it sends out the wrong message that taking and destroying lives on roads is treated leniently ' but @entity45 , of road safety charity @entity46 , said : ‘ brake believes it is inappropriate to prosecute someone whose bad driving has killed or seriously injured for “ careless ” driving , because if you have killed or maimed through your bad driving , your actions were by definition dangerous			1
‘ @entity46 is very concerned that fewer and fewer road death cases are being prosecuted under the charge of causing death by dangerous driving			0
‘ this means that in many cases people who kill through their bad driving are receiving unduly low sentences that do not reflect the harm they have caused , do not act as a deterrent and send out the wrong message that taking and destroying lives on roads is treated leniently			2
’ the tragedy occurred at 5.20pm on june 6 , 2011 , as @entity17 was on her way home to the village of @entity73 - in - @entity74 near @entity75 , @entity76			0
mr @entity10 , a @entity78 member who had two sons and three grandchildren , was taking @entity13 for his regular walk			1
@entity17 , in her silver @entity83 car , pushed the button to send her text message as she drove down the road			0
police said her car then hit mr @entity10 and his dog , who were both then hit again by a @entity91 travelling behind			1
no one in either car was injured but mr @entity10 suffered horrendous injuries and despite the efforts of medics at @entity97 , he later died			0
@entity17 was charged last january with death by dangerous driving but @entity100 , prosecuting , told @entity101 on monday that the @entity102 had decided to accept her guilty plea to the lesser charge after discussions with mr @entity10 ’s family			2
@entity17 , who has no previous convictions , will be sentenced on december 17			0
an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that @entity10 was hit by a car that was being driven by @entity6 as she was sending a text message			1
it also incorrectly stated that miss @entity6 was pulling out of a layby in @entity115 when in fact it was @entity118			0
and also that miss @entity6 had a collision with a @entity91			0
nor did miss @entity6 send a text seconds after the collision with mr @entity10 .			1

@entity6 killed @entity10 and his dog , @entity13 , in june 2011
she admitted death by careless driving and faces up to five years in prison
had pulled over to write message but did *n't* hit send until she was driving
