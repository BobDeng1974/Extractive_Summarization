by @entity0 a comet which could become the brightest for a century is racing into our inner solar system , to the delight of astronomers			0
@entity7 will pass exceptionally close to the sun in just under a fortnight , creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail			1
at least , it will if the heat does not blast the comet to smithereens - which scientists warn is not out of the question			1
cosmic show : @entity7 , which is heading to within 600,000 miles of our sun on november 28 the comet was discovered in september last year by two amateur astronomers using @entity24 's @entity23 , @entity23 , who marvelled at how bright it was even beyond @entity27 's orbit			1
on november 28 it will pass just 621,000 miles from the sun 's surface - 150 times closer to our star than we are			1
it will be more than 100 times closer to the sun than the @entity36 comet , one of the brightest of the last century which was visible with the naked eye for a record 18 months , passed at its peak in 1997			1
as it blasts towards the sun , the intense gravitational pull will make it speed up to 234 miles per second			2
the sun 's rays will also heat the ball of ice , metal and rock to 2,760 degrees @entity48 , making it much brighter than most comets - with some scientists claiming it could outshine the moon			1
@entity23 is named after the @entity23 , used by a pair of @entity24 astronomers to detect the comet in september 2012 , but it officially is known as c / 2012 @entity57 an image taken and annotated by astronomers in @entity60 , @entity61 , showing the tail pointing away from the sun some have warned that the intense pressure on the comet could simply blast it apart , as the heat melts not just the ice but also rock and metal			2
however , recent calculations have shown @entity23 is more likely than not to survive			0
over the weekend , amateur astronomers began posting the first pictures of the comet on the internet that were taken with just binoculars or small telescopes			0
pilot @entity79 wrote on the @entity81 website : ' i finally saw @entity7 for the first time using small binoculars ! it was faint , but is predicted to brighten and move each day ! exciting ! ' it is expected to be visible to the naked eye in early mornings throughout december and during the night in january			1
it is currently passing through the @entity90 in the east of the morning sky			0
comets are believed to be frozen remains left over from the formation of the solar system four and a half billion years ago			0
@entity97 : @entity23 could prove brighter than @entity36 , pictured , which lit up the skies in 1997 @entity23 , which has never visited our inner solar system before , has emerged from the @entity101 , a reservoir of icy bodies beyond @entity105 's orbit			2
these balls of ice are occasionally ' bumped ' by the sun 's gravity out of the cloud and into a flight path that brings them into the inner solar system			2
the vast majority of comets are invisible to the naked eye , but the most famous is @entity117			1
that is because it is the only comet which visits often enough and shines brightly enough to be seen by most people in their lifetime			0
it comes to our inner solar system between every 75 and 76 years and last visited in 1986			0
among other things , it inspired the name of 1950s rock and roll outfit @entity129 .			0

@entity7 will skirt 150 times closer than us to the sun on november 28
it will either light up in *magnificent* spectacle *...* or be vapourised
@entity117 has already become visible without a telescope for the first time
some scientists have even claimed it could shine brighter than the moon
