they ca n’t lay claim to morning sickness , sleepless nights or swollen feet			0
but it seems that fathers - to - be do suffer at least one symptom of pregnancy			0
research shows that men ’s hormones go into a spin in the months before becoming a parent for the first time			1
a fall in testosterone may make men less aggressive and more caring			0
a drop in oestradiol helps prepare them for new responsibilities the prospect of fatherhood brings with it a dip in two key hormones			1
the changes may help men prepare for bonding with their babies – as well as stop them from straying			1
in these most detailed study of its kind , @entity35 researchers measured hormone levels in 29 couples at four points during pregnancy			1
all four hormones – testosterone , cortisol , progesterone and oestradiol , a form of the sex hormone oestrogen – shot up in the women			2
amounts of testosterone and oestradiol fell in the men			0
levels of the other two hormones did not change , the @entity55 reports			0
the surge in women ’s hormones in pregnancy has been well - researched but this study is the first to look in detail at men ’s hormones			1
@entity67 researcher @entity66 said : ‘ other studies have shown that men ’s hormones change once they become fathers			1
' but our findings suggest that these changes may begin even earlier , during the transition to fatherhood			0
the changes may help men prepare for bonding with their babies – as well as stop them from straying ‘ we do n’t yet know exactly why men ’s hormones are changing			1
' these changes could be a function of the psychological changes that men experience as they prepare to become fathers , changes in romantic relationships or even physical changes that men experience along with their pregnant partners			2
’ a fall in testosterone , for instance , may make men less aggressive and more caring			0
it may also be nature ’s way of keeping them faithful to their partner			0
a drop in oestradiol may also help prepare men for their new responsibilities			2
it seems , however , that men are pretty relaxed about fatherhood			2
cortisol and progesterone – the two hormones that did not rise in the men as the birth become closer – both go up when stressed .			1

the prospect of fatherhood brings with it a dip in two key hormones
helps men prepare to bond with their babies – and stop them straying
@entity67 study is the most detailed of its kind
