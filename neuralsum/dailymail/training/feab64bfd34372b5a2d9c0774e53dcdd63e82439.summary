by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 02:15 est , 23 september 2013 the son of the @entity3 kidnapper has spoken out for the first time since his father 's death , saying society should learn from @entity8 to better deal with sexual predators , mental illness and domestic abuse			1
in a letter published in the @entity15 today , @entity13 said his father deserved to serve ' every day ' of the 1,000 - year sentence that he received for the kidnapping and decade - long rape , torture and beatings of @entity8 , @entity8 and @entity8			1
however , he cautioned that ' justice truly will have been served ' only if the country examines and learns from the horrific ordeal			0
@entity13 , right , circa 2001 , is seen with his father standing in front of a pad - locked basement door in the @entity27 where @entity8 , left , kept his three victims behind bars : @entity8 , 53 , admitted to his crimes and accepted a prison sentence of 1,000 years			1
he is hanged himself one month later @entity13 , a banker in @entity31 and a former journalist , said he has been in hiding since news broke that his father had been arrested for keeping the three young women captive for more than 10 years in may			1
' i was horrified and disgusted and angered when i got the news of the unthinkable crimes my father committed			2
he deserved to pay for his actions , every day of those 1,000 years he could possibly serve , ' he wrote			1
' my anger with him kept me from visiting him in prison , even when he was moved to a facility just 20 minutes away from my doorstep			2
' @entity8 hanged himself in his @entity50 prison cell september 3 - after just one month after he admitted to his heinous crimes and accepted a sentence that guaranteed he would spend the rest of his life in prison			1
recovering : @entity8 , left , @entity8 , center , and @entity8 , right , have all appeared in public since they were freed - though experts say all will likely bear lasting scars from their ordeal he was taken to a hospital in @entity31 , @entity50 , just a few miles from his son 's home , where he was pronounced dead			1
since @entity13 first spoke out to @entity68 , days after news of the heinous crimes came to light , he has denied have any knowledge of his father 's double - life and worked to distance the himself and his three sisters from his father			1
he reiterated those assertions in his letter sunday , saying he wanted to scream from the rooftops that he was ' not his father			2
' ' i am not my father , and i ca n't explain his actions or be held accountable for something i never knew he was doing , ' he wrote			2
gone : even the @entity81 on @entity82 have been demolished - leaving little trace of the pain and terror that was inflicted there for a decade he added , ' i was horrified and disgusted and angered when i got the news of the unthinkable crimes my father committed			1
' @entity13 described being hounded by the news media and how thieves broke into his apartment and vandalized it after his name surfaced publicly			1
still , he says , the demolition of his father 's house on @entity82 in @entity3 and @entity8 's death should not be cause to ' bid goodbye and good riddance ' to his crimes			1
' if my father 's life and death can lead to changes in how we deal with sexual predators , domestic violence , mental illness and , yes , prison safety , then we should have those discussions , ' he wrote			1
' if we can prevent a repeat here or anywhere , then justice truly will have been served amid all the broken pieces my father left behind			2
