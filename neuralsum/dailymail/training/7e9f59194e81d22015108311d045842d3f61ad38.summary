@entity0 has warned @entity1 it will take an inflated fee for them to have any chance of prising @entity5 away from @entity6 in january			1
@entity7 revealed this week that the @entity9 club were weighing up a £ 1.5million offer for the @entity11 forward			1
@entity0 , however , has made it clear he has no wish to part with @entity5 , who has contributed seven goals this term despite operating mainly on the left flank			1
the @entity18 manager believes the 26 - year - old can further improve his physical condition but insisted he has been impressed by his mentality – an aspect of his character the former @entity25 player has faced criticism over in the past			1
@entity5 ' form for @entity6 has drawn transfer interest from @entity30 ‘ we want to build the best team we can for @entity6 and i think the january transfer window will see us strengthen rather than weaken , ’ said @entity0 as he prepared for tonight ’s @entity32 tie against @entity33			1
‘ we will see what possibilities there are			1
we always look at the players and think of what is the best for the future for the club and the right way to go			1
‘ nobody is for sale - but then everyone is for sale as well ! if someone comes in with money where we ca n’t say no , then of course we must think about it			1
but they are all very expensive			2
‘ i think @entity5 is happy and i ’ve been talking to him a lot			1
he ’s under contract and i ’m in control of the situation			2
’ @entity5 signed a new three - year deal in october of last year and @entity0 views his adaptability as an asset			1
the 26 - year - old striker has scored seven goals so far this season for the @entity64 club ‘ @entity5 has played well on the left but he is not there yet , ’ he said			1
‘ he needs to improve physically so he can run even more and he can get even sharper			2
‘ he is an important player because he is scoring goals and he is a very intelligent player			2
he knows how to play and he can also link up well with the other players			2
‘ he needs to get his fitness up for the highest level but his attitude is very good			2
’ @entity5 joined @entity6 as a central striker in 2010 and has netted 75 times for the club			1
@entity0 is n’t ruling out a return to that preferred role in the future			1
‘ i think it is possible , ’ said the @entity78			2
‘ he has to show himself positively in the games and the training			2
‘ when he does play as a striker he goes out to the left all of the time			1
so i do n’t think it is that different - and he enjoys playing on the left			1
he has also played some very good games there			2
‘ he has the talent but he has to keep working the way he has been and then he will get better every day			2
’ @entity5 ( centre ) trains with @entity91 ( left ) ahead of @entity6 's @entity32 tie with @entity33 @entity93 has been @entity6 ’s main goal threat this term but his ineligibility in @entity97 means £ 2m signing @entity98 could be given a chance to convince in @entity100 this evening			1
captain @entity101 has been left at home as he is one booking away from a @entity97 ban			0
@entity105 is being rested following his recent return to action , while injured trio @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 also miss out			0
@entity6 are guaranteed to finish second in @entity111 but there is approximately £ 160,000 up for grabs in prize money this evening			1
@entity115 would take their total @entity32 earnings from @entity117 to almost £ 2m			1
it would also bolster the club ’s co-efficient , which impacts upon the seedings for next season ’s @entity124 qualifiers			0
‘ it is an important game ahead of the next round and also for getting seeded next year , ’ insisted @entity0			1
‘ these are all important things we have to think of			0
it is also important to use this game to make the team even better in @entity97 games away from home			0
we want to get a victory because we know that would be a very good achievement			0
‘ some players have not travelled but when people get their chance it is up to them to take it			0
it is up to the players coming in to say : “ @entity0 , i want to play			1
” @entity6 manager @entity0 speaks in @entity100 ahead of his team 's clash with @entity33 ‘ there is also prize money from this game and this is good			1
it would be a positive even though we know it wo n’t be huge			0
‘ we will go to a training camp soon ( in @entity155 next month ) as we want to improve and all the money that comes in can help us improve as a unit			0
’ @entity33 boss @entity158 also dismissed talk of tonight ’s clash being meaningless and insisted his players must leave everything on the field			0
@entity164 is demanding maximum commitment from @entity33 after a disappointing @entity97 campaign that has yielded just three points from five @entity111 games			0
‘ i do not agree there is no imperative to win , ’ he said			0
‘ we ca n’t qualify but all other motives are there			0
we should be prepared to die to win			0
‘ i will play my strongest possible team			0
we will look at the game and play to win			0
‘ it does n’t matter if @entity6 make changes			0
players who are at @entity6 certainly do not lack talent			0
whoever comes in , it will not be easy			0
‘ we want to win this last @entity97 game			0
it improves our image and it carries prestige			0
it would also give us coefficient points and money			0
