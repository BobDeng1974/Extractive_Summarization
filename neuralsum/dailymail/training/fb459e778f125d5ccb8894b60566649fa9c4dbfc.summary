by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:08 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 16:37 est , 4 june 2013 a judge has accepted @entity5 ' plea of not guilty by reason of insanity - as the @entity9 theater shooting suspect smirked and yawned his way through the hearing			1
@entity5 , who allegedly killed 12 theater goers and injured 70 more as they watched @entity13 last july , looked indifferent as he followed the ground rules of the plea in court on tuesday			1
after judge @entity17 read through the 18 points and asked @entity5 if he had any questions , @entity5 answered ' no ' in a clear , firm voice			2
@entity17 then accepted the plea , setting the stage for a lengthy mental evaluation of @entity5			1
the judge also determined prosecutors can have access to a notebook that @entity5 sent to a psychiatrist filled with violent drawings before last summer 's rampage			1
the insanity plea is widely seen as @entity5 ' best chance of avoiding execution , and possibly his only chance , given the weight of the evidence against him			1
@entity5 ' lawyers repeatedly have said he is mentally ill , but they delayed the insanity plea while arguing state laws were unconstitutional			1
they said the laws could hobble the defense if @entity5 ' case should ever reach the phase where the jury decides if he should be executed			2
the judge rejected that argument last week			0
' killer ' : @entity5 sported a beard and longer hair as he appeared in court on tuesday silent : @entity5 only said ' no ' when the judge asked him whether he had any questions about his plea on tuesday , @entity17 ordered @entity5 to undergo a mental evaluation at the state hospital in @entity71 , as soon as the hospital is ready to conduct it			1
but evaluators want to review the 40,000 pages of evidence in the case first , so it 's unclear when it will happen			0
@entity17 set a tentative deadline of august 2 for @entity5 ' evaluation			2
@entity9 law defines insanity as the inability to distinguish right from wrong caused by a diseased or defective mind			0
if jurors find @entity5 not guilty by reason of insanity , he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital			1
he could eventually be released if doctors find his sanity has been restored , but that is considered unlikely			0
in court : judge @entity93 accepted the plea , setting the stage for a lengthy mental evaluation if jurors convict him , the next step is the penalty phase , during which both sides call witnesses to testify about factors that could affect why @entity5 should or should n't be executed			1
the jury would then decide whether @entity5 should be executed or sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole			0
if jurors impose the death penalty , it would trigger court appeals and open other possibilities that would take years to resolve			0
the hearing came as the court released dozens of pretrial motions filed by defense attorneys challenging the admissibility of ballistics , handwriting and mountains of other evidence			0
the motions challenge the search and seizure of computers , a pistol from @entity5 ' car outside the theater , evidence taken from @entity5 ' booby - trapped apartment , emails and other items			0
scene : members of the the prosecution team are pictured at the @entity136 theater last july , days after @entity5 allegedly killed 12 people and injured 70 more there as they watched a film apartment : authorities said @entity142 had booby - trapped his apartment for police after the shootings the motions also indicate the prosecution has as many as 3,000 witnesses , including @entity149 and @entity33 officials , and demands that prosecutors hand over as many as 2,000 pieces of physical evidence			1
they also signaled that @entity5 will seek a change of venue because of pretrial publicity			0
lawyers also argued about whether prosecutors should have access to a notebook @entity5 sent to psychiatrist @entity162			1
media reports have said the notebook contains violent drawings			0
defense lawyers argued @entity167 never received the notebook so prosecutors should n't have access to it ; prosecutors say police would like to do unspecified ' additional processing ' on the notebook			2
@entity17 ordered the notebook to be turned over next week			0
missed : people visit a memorial for the victims across the street from the movie theater last july victims : six - year - old @entity183 , left , and 18 - year - old @entity184 , right , a popular musician and art student , were among the 12 people who lost their lives in the shooting last july hundreds of people were watching a midnight showing of @entity13 at the @entity33 theater july 20 when the shooting occurred			1
the dead included a @entity195 veteran who threw himself in front of his friends to shield them , an aspiring sports journalist who had survived a mall shooting just two months earlier , and a six - year - old girl			0
prosecutors say @entity5 spent months buying weapons , ammunition and materials for explosives and scouted the theater in advance			2
he donned police - style body armor , tossed a gas canister into the seats and opened fire , they say			0
what a different a year makes : @entity5 left in his mug shot and right in his first court appearance last july			2

judge also ruled that prosecutors could access the notebook @entity5 sent to his psychiatrist before the shooting spree last summer
insanity plea means he will now undergo lengthy mental evaluation
if found not guilty by insanity he will go to state mental hospital indefinitely
@entity5 , who now sports long hair and a beard , is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 70 more in @entity33 cinema in july
