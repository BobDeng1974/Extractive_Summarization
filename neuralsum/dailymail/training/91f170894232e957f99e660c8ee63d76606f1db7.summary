@entity1 's famous warship @entity0 may have been painted the wrong colour after historians examining the ship found no evidence of the well known ' bumblebee ' design in its original paintwork			1
hundreds of fragments of the ship 's original paint have been studied , with experts concluding that the hull was mostly black with varnished timber - not the pale orange and black design adorning the ship in a @entity18 drydock today			1
the paint analysis may lead to @entity0 being repainted in its traditional colours , and casts doubt on the legend that the current design was introduced on @entity1 's orders during an 1803 refit			1
wrong colour : @entity0 may have been painted the wrong colour after historians examining the ship found no evidence of the well known ' bumblebee ' design in its original paintwork questions : the paint analysis casts doubt on the legend that @entity0 's current design ( masthead pictured left ) was introduced on the orders of @entity1 ( right ) during an 1803 refit experts at the @entity40 's conservation institute described the current design as a ' hideous orange ' that was brought in about 100 years after the @entity42			1
by that point @entity0 had become a symbol of @entity45 's naval strength , and it is thought the bumblebee pattern was added during a renovation to give @entity1 's flagship a more distinctive look			1
' what you see today is largely an early 20th century invention of what an 18th century warship looked like , ' the institute 's founder @entity50 told @entity57 - adding that the team 's work was inspired by a item on the @entity61			0
mr @entity50 's team were able to peel back 72 layers of paint one - by - one to by the reveal the ship 's changing decoration since it was first launched on may 7 , 1765			2
according to the research , the ship was originally a simple black and vanished wood design when it first saw action at the @entity74 in 1778 and 1781 , the @entity67 in 1782 and the @entity68 in 1797			0
is this really how it was ? @entity0 was depicted with two - tone paintwork in this painting of the @entity79 by @entity80 from 1822 - 17 years after the event history : mr @entity50 's team were able to peel back 72 layers of paint one - by - one to by the reveal @entity0 's changing decoration since its launch on may 7 , 1765 later in 1797 , @entity0 was declared unfit for service as a warship and was converted to a hospital ship to hold wounded prisioners of war			1
within two years the ship returned to war service and , by the time @entity1 hoisted his flag in @entity0 on 18 may 1803 , it had been painted a light shade of ochre - a kind of pale , rust colour			2
the research also suggests @entity0 's deck - on which @entity1 was shot and killed by a @entity101 sniper during the @entity79 - was a pale cream colour , not the bare wood often depicted in classical paintings			1
meanwhile cabins on the ship , including the one belonging to @entity1 , are thought to have been much plainer than they look today			0
' these were working spaces , not country houses at sea as they appear now , ' mr @entity50 said			0
although it had been in service for 40 years by the time , @entity0 's most famous moment came during the @entity79 , when it was used as @entity1 's flagship			1
during the battle , @entity0 led 27 @entity45 ships to triumph over 33 from the @entity101 and @entity117 navy			0
the @entity117 fleet lost twenty - two ships , without a single @entity45 vessel being lost			0
the battle was seen as confirmation of @entity45 's naval supremacy - in part due to @entity1 's unorthodox tactics			2
he went against traditional naval convention and divided his smaller force into two columns directed perpendicularly against the larger enemy fleet			0
the result was a decisive @entity45 victory , with the commander of the joint @entity101 and @entity117 forces , @entity132 , captured along with his ship @entity135			0
the battle is widely seen as @entity45 's greatest naval victory , but during the action @entity1 was fatally wounded by a @entity101 sniper on the deck of @entity0			2
his body was brought back to @entity142 where he was given a state funeral			0
@entity1 's death secured his position as one of @entity45 's most heroic military figures and numerous monuments , including @entity149 in @entity151 's @entity150 have been created in his memory .			2

paint fragments suggest orange and black pattern was a *modern* addition
the original @entity0 is *believed* to have been black and bare wood
analysis may mean @entity1 's @entity79 flagship is repainted
