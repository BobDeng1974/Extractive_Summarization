tests on 8,800 people over 50 have showed cigarettes can damage memory smoking is known to be highly damaging to physical health , being a major factor in cancer and heart disease			1
now , however , its alarming effects on the mental well - being of millions of smokers have been outlined by @entity14 scientists			2
lighting up regularly has been associated with a sharp decline in the performance of the brain , according to their study			2
they found that middle - aged smokers performed less well on tests compared with those without the tobacco habit			0
the project examined memory , planning and overall mental ability after four and eight years			0
the tests included asking people to learn new words or name as many animals as they could in a minute			1
researchers concluded that smoking ‘ consistently ’ reduced all three performance measures after four years			2
they also found that high blood pressure and being overweight took their toll of brainpower – but not as much as smoking			1
the team warned that people need to be aware of the impact on their health of lifestyle choices , like smoking			1
risk factor data was examined for more than 8,800 people aged 50 and over taking part in the @entity49			1
the researchers at @entity51 were investigating links between the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke and the state of the brain			0
smoking , high blood pressure , high cholesterol levels and a high @entity60 all worsen the risk of dementia high blood pressure and high risk of stroke were also associated with lower scores for memory and overall mental ability after eight years			1
being overweight was linked to poor memory , according to the findings published in the journal @entity73			0
lead scientist dr @entity74 said ‘ cognitive decline becomes more common with ageing and , for an increasing number of people , interferes with daily functioning and well - being			2
‘ we have identified a number of risk factors which could be associated with accelerated cognitive decline , all of which could be modifiable			2
this offers valuable knowledge for prevention and treatment interventions			0
’ the researchers said their results indicate that high blood pressure has a gradual effect on the brain over a long period			1
this could explain why short - term trials of blood pressure drugs being used to treat mental decline failed to show a clear benefit			1
recent laboratory research suggested a compound in tobacco called @entity104 provokes white blood cells in the central nervous system to attack healthy cells , leading to severe neurological damage			1
there are almost 10 million smokers in the @entity14			0
the habit is still by far the biggest single cause of preventable illness and premature death			0
it is a major contributory factor in causing heart disease and 39,000 lung cancer cases each year			0
dr @entity121 , of @entity122 , said : ‘ research has repeatedly linked smoking and high blood pressure to a greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia			1
this study adds weight to that			0
‘ cognitive decline as we age can develop into dementia , and unravelling the factors linked to this decline could be crucial for finding ways to prevent the condition			0
’ @entity136 , of the @entity137 , said : ‘ we all know smoking , a high blood pressure , high cholesterol and a high @entity60 is bad for our heart			1
‘ this adds to the huge amount of evidence that also suggests they can be bad for our head too			0
’ one in three of the over- 65s will develop dementia , she added .			0

test on nearly 9,000 people over 50 have shown lifestyles could damage the mind as well as the body
smoking , high blood pressure , high cholesterol levels and a high @entity60 all worsen the risk
