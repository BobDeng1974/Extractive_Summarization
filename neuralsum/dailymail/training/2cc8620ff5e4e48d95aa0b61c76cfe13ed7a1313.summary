by @entity0 published : 04:23 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 04:24 est , 24 may 2012 devastating nuclear reactor meltdowns like those at @entity4 and @entity5 could happen every decade , according to a disturbing new study			2
scientists at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , fear similar catastrophes could occur around the world every ten to 20 years - 200 times more frequently than previously thought			1
and they said people in @entity15 have a higher risk than anybody else in the world of being affected by radioactive fallout from such a disaster			1
warning : devastating nuclear reactor meltdowns like those at @entity5 ( pictured ) could happen every ten to 20 years , according to a worrying new study the researchers based their gloomy predictions on the operating hours of all civil nuclear reactors and how many meltdowns there have been			2
they also warned that half the radioactive caesium - 137 produced , which was released following the @entity4 and @entity5 meltdowns , would spread over an area reaching as far as 1,000 kilometres ( about 620 miles ) from the reactor			0
@entity15 is likely to be contaminated once every 50 years , according to the research team led by @entity35 , director of the @entity9			2
the @entity36 designates an area as ' contaminated ' if it has a reading of more than 40 kilobecquerels of caesium - 137 per square metre			0
prof @entity35 said @entity11 needed to carry out an ' in - depth and public analysis of the actual risks of nuclear accidents '			2
global risk : the map shows the annual probability in per cent of radioactive contamination by more than 40 kilobecquerels per square metre and he added : ' in light of our findings i believe an internationally coordinated phasing out of nuclear energy should also be considered			1
' accidents at @entity60 , @entity61 , in 1979 and @entity4 , @entity62 , in 1986 made nuclear power a politically toxic issue			0
radioactive contamination spread across much of @entity15 following the meltdown at the @entity68 's @entity4 plant			2
the meltdown at @entity71 's @entity5 plant following the march 2011 tsunami triggered a worldwide debate on the future of the energy source , leading to @entity11 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022			1
before the crisis , @entity71 provided almost a third of its electricity from 54 reactors			0
but earlier this month it closed its last nuclear reactor on the island of @entity85 for maintenance - leaving the country without electricity from atomic energy for the first time in more than four decades			0
worldwide , there are currently 440 nuclear reactors in operation , with 60 more planned			0
the team in @entity10 found @entity11 citizens in the densely populated southwestern part of the country run the highest risk of radioactive contamination in the world because of the numerous nuclear power plants near the borders between @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity11 and the prevailing westerly wind			1
disaster : radioactive contamination spread across much of @entity15 following the meltdown at the @entity68 's @entity4 plant in 1986 if a nuclear meltdown happened in @entity15 , an area with a population of around 28 million people would be contaminated , they said			1
this figure would be even higher in southern @entity115 , due to the dense populations			0
a major nuclear accident there would affect around 34 million people , while in the eastern @entity121 and east @entity115 this would be 14 to 21 million people , said the @entity11 scientists			1
prof @entity35 , who is an atmospheric chemist , said : ' @entity11 's exit from the nuclear energy programme will reduce the national risk of radioactive contamination			1
' however , an even stronger reduction would result if @entity11 's neighbours were to switch off their reactors			0
' aftermath : officials scan people for radiation , 60km ( 37 miles ) west of the nuclear power plant in @entity5 on march 18 , 2011			0

@entity11 scientists say meltdown could happen 200 times more often than previously calculated
people in @entity15 have a *greater* risk than anybody else in the world of being affected by radioactive fallout from such a disaster
