what better way to kick off the week you get married than by settling a pressing matter at work before you relax and prepare for the big day ? that is how @entity5 may be feeling as he looks to face @entity6 in the final of the @entity8			1
the @entity10 @entity9 marries @entity11 in @entity12 on saturday and , win or lose on sunday , he will be heading straight to the airport to get back and focus on what lies ahead next weekend			1
@entity5 reacts as he reaches the @entity8 final with a win over @entity17 in the last four he will face long - time rival @entity6 in the final in @entity19 on sunday @entity5 's fiancee @entity11 watches on in the heat in @entity19 during his semi-final he would dearly love to do so with the trophy in his luggage			1
for one , it would represent his biggest tournament win since taking the @entity27 title in 2013 , irrefutable proof that he is back towards his best			0
perhaps even more importantly it would end the growing dominance of @entity6 over the @entity32 — and everyone else for that matter			2
@entity5 will need no reminding that he has lost nine out of his last 10 matches against the @entity37 , so it is a huge task			1
even more remarkably , @entity6 has won his past nine finals at these masters - level events , which are one tier down from the @entity41			2
@entity5 allowed himself to get befuddled by the world @entity9 ’s histrionics in the @entity45 final , and then played a plain bad match when thrashed by him in their @entity48 semi-final last month			1
the 27 - year - old was in clinical form as he set up a final showdown with @entity6 @entity5 reacts after winning the final point before shaking hands with @entity17 as he heads into the final ‘ i learned more in the @entity48 @entity56 match from what i did n’t do , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ the final in @entity59 did n’t necessarily feel like it came down to the tennis or the tactics , but in @entity48 there were a few things i did wrong			0
’ @entity64 of that list was to lapse into his tendency to feel his way into the match , rather than come out firing on all cylinders			0
if @entity5 does that again he will lose , but he plays well here and is hugely familiar with the heavier conditions , so this should be closer			2
he has also played all his matches during the day , which will help with the lunchtime start ( 6pm @entity10 )			0
his opponent , however , looked incredibly sharp in defusing @entity77 ’s big serve in the semi-final and @entity6 knows recent history is on his side			0
@entity5 is set to marry his fiancee in @entity12 next saturday ‘ it can only serve as a positive , going in with the fact i won the last six matches we played against each other , especially the most recent one , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ it gives me confidence and maybe a slight mental advantage			0
but we are talking about small margins , that ’s always the case when we play each other			0
’ one thing for sure is that the next big tournament when they face off , two players who have been rivals since before their teenage years will both be married men .			0
