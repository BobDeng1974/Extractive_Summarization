' loneliness maps ' are being used to tackle the problem of elderly people being left alone by working out which areas ' residents are most at risk			1
health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day , leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure			2
now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation			1
map : this ' loneliness map ' was drawn up by @entity22 showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated two county councils , @entity25 and @entity26 , have already implemented the maps , which allow them to target ' danger zones ' of loneliness			1
a new report from the @entity31 and the @entity32 to end loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country			0
in @entity26 , council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people			1
they looked for areas with large numbers of over- 65s , people living alone , people suffering from mental illness , households with no car and people on a low income			0
danger : being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia ( picture posed by model ) the council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours , are unsatisfied with their social life and say they do n't have someone to talk to			1
they then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness , with the most vulnerable areas marked in red			0
a spokesman for the council said : ' targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in @entity26 and we are always looking at new ways to reach them			2
' the map we 've adapted from a model by @entity22 means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most			0
' the campaign to end @entity82 has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area			2
the campaign 's director @entity87 said : ' finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging , as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities			0
' however , it is encouraging that , across the country , there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness			2
' if local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness , we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services			1
' the report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness			0
people from ethnic minorities , those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible .			0

local councils are urged to draw up maps of the residents who are at risk
@entity25 and @entity26 have already made ' loneliness maps '
experts warn that being lonely can lead to serious health problems
