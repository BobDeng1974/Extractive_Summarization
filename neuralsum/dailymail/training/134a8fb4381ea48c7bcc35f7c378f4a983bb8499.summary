years after it was created the intricate fresco , which dated back to the early period of the @entity30 ( 1644 - 1911 ) , was left with only hints of its former glory , with large pieces scratched away and only scraps of colour left			1
but they have now been completely painted over with cartoon - like @entity39 figures in garish colours			1
