by @entity0 a new @entity2 injection could give people 100 per cent protection against the virus for up to three months a new @entity8 injection could protect people from the infection for up to three months , a study suggests			1
researchers believe the injection of long - lasting drugs could temporarily provide 100 per cent protection against hiv infection			1
they say this could be a huge breakthrough which would be particularly important for couples in which one partner is infected while the other is not			0
in two separate studies scientists found that the injection gives monkeys complete protection when it is administered monthly , the @entity22 reports			1
however , scientists think that having a single injection just once every three months month could be sufficient to provide complete protection			2
they hope the results can be replicated in humans			0
currently , people who are in a relationship with someone who is hiv positive are given low doses of antiretroviral drugs to prevent them contracting the infection			1
however , this can be problematic if they forget to take the drugs at the right times and , even if they do , it only offers about 90 per cent protection			2
the researchers hope this injection could eventually offer a safer alternative			2
human trials of the vaccine are due to start later this year according to experts at @entity50			0
however , if this is successful , a larger human trial will still be required before the injection could be widely offered			2
this would take a number of years			0
it is thought the injection could be particularly beneficial for women in @entity58			2
the injection could be particularly beneficial for @entity8 negative people who are in relationships with people who are @entity8 positive			1
image shows @entity8 in human tissue many such women with an hiv positive partner already take the daily pills but some have reported that taking medication every day leaves them open to stigma by people who assume they are already infected			1
as a result , they might benefit from being able to go for a regular protective injection			0
many of these women already receive long - lasting contraceptive injections for fear that their partner would be angry he found a packet of @entity80			0
as a result , offering the @entity8 injection as well could be relatively easy			1
currently people who are in relationships with people who are @entity8 positive take low doses of antiretroviral drugs each day to prevent them becoming infected			1
however , many forget to take them or are stigmatised for doing so dr @entity91 , director of the @entity92 at @entity93 told the @entity22 that these contraceptive injections give ‘ a good analogy for how [ the @entity2 vaccine ] might work in developing countries ’			0
one of the injection trials was conducted by the @entity99 in @entity100 and saw six female monkeys given monthly doses of @entity103 – a long - lasting antiretroviral drug			1
another six monkeys were given a placebo and then they were all exposed to @entity8 in a way that simulated having vaginal sex with an infected man			1
the researchers observed that none of the injected monkeys became infected while all of the unprotected ones did			0
the second study was designed to establish whether the injection could be as effective in people having anal sex with someone @entity8 positive			1
it was carried out at @entity93 , in @entity121 , and involved 16 monkeys who were injected with the same drug			0
during the study none of the monkeys who were given the injection contracted the infection while all of the unprotected ones did			0
dr @entity130 , director of the @entity131 , told the @entity22 that the results are ‘ very impressive for something in the animal model ’			0
‘ this is the most exciting innovation in the field of hiv prevention that i 've heard recently , ’ added dr @entity135 , an @entity2 expert at the @entity136 , a foundation affiliated with the @entity138 , @entity139 .			0

the injection of antiretroviral drugs gives monkeys 100 *%* protection
it is set to be trialled in humans and could eventually be widely available
it would be most beneficial for *uninfected* people who are in relationships with people who are @entity8 positive
