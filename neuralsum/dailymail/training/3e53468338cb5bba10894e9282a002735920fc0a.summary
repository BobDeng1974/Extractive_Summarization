by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity1 admitted he had never felt under more pressure after hitting 95 as @entity3 reached an imposing 247 for two on the first day of the third @entity4 against @entity5 in @entity6			1

but what it ’s done for me is given me confidence that my batting is going in the right direction again			2
‘ the most pleasing aspect is that it ’s probably the most pressure i ’ve ever been under as a player			2
when everyone is telling me to stop doing the job and it ’s not working , to score runs is a nice place to be			2
‘ i would have loved those extra five , so that the 20 - odd innings without a hundred that everyone keeps banging on about could have stopped			2
’ few have suggested @entity1 be dropped from the side — only that @entity3 have won none of their last 10 tests and that the captaincy may have affected his batting			1
fell : he eventually went just five short of his 100 but behind the choirboy ’s smile last night lurked the grit that made him the third - highest run - scorer in @entity3 ’s @entity4 history			1
‘ it ’s been a tough six months , and it ’s still going to be tough , ’ he said			0
‘ but i feel as if i ’ve got a good attitude to the job and i can smile through tough times			0
’ @entity1 had a rare moment of good fortune when @entity11 dropped him at third slip off debutant seamer @entity59 when he had only 15			0
out : @entity5 's @entity11 successfully appeal for the wicket of @entity1 he said : ‘ the attitude was to make sure at least i go down fighting , and sometimes you need a bit of luck			1
it was nice @entity11 dropped me , but he did have the last laugh			0
’ the overwhelming mood was one of relief			2
‘ it ’s just a sense of contributing to the team , ’ he said			0
‘ i ca n’t tell you how frustrating it is as a batter when you keep going out and not scoring runs and sit back there in the dressing - room			1
and everyone ’s supporting you but it still feels as if you ’re letting people down			0
‘ it was an amazing reception from the crowd , even when i was walking out to bat			0
i ’ve never experienced anything like that			0
the noise would have been fantastic if i had got a hundred			0
