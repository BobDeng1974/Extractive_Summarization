by @entity0 published : 21:11 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 21:11 est , 21 december 2012 @entity1 faces an uphill battle to maintain @entity4 ’s top notch credit rating next year following the release of data showing the economy is doing less well than hoped			1
new government borrowing rose sharply to £ 17.5billion in november			2
this suggests the chancellor will find it hard to bring the total deficit for 2012 - 13 down to £ 80.5billion as projected in the @entity13 just two weeks ago			1
task ahead : the chancellor may struggle to bring the total deficit down to the level projected in the @entity13 just a fortnight ago dampened : the @entity18 - aided bounce in @entity19 in the third quarter has been downgraded slightly from 1 % to 0.9 %			1
sluggish growth has led to a shortfall in @entity23 and company tax receipts , as well as higher spending as welfare costs rise			2
@entity28 figures show output in the third quarter expanded by 0.9 per cent rather than the 1 per cent previously reported			2
@entity30 immediately attacked the chancellor over the numbers , accusing him of using ‘ smoke and mirrors in the @entity13			1
’ @entity30 ’s @entity35 spokesman @entity34 said : ‘ these figures show that borrowing is rising and is up by 10 per cent so far this year			1
’ however , the government is likely to hang on to a glimmer of hope – the service sector , which represents as much as 70 per cent of national output , is improving			2
a key survey shows that in october – the first month of the final quarter of the year – the services sector expanded and construction spending strengthened			2
if this optimism held into november and december it is possible that a drop back into recession could be avoided			0
graph showing initial and revised gdp quarter on quarter growth ( source : @entity28 ) among the keys to whether another dip in the economy can be averted will be the @entity58 ’s ‘ funding for lending ’ scheme , designed to bring down the cost and ease of home loans and credit for small and medium sized businesses			1
if lending by the banks can be restored , momentum from the housing market and small businesses could keep the economy buoyant into 2013			1
much of the focus of the markets will be on the public finances			0
all three of the major credit rating agencies have placed @entity4 ’s ‘ @entity80 ’ credit rating , among the best in the world , on ‘ negative watch ’			0
a run of bad monthly deficit and debt numbers could push the @entity4 over its own fiscal cliff			0
@entity85 reported that the @entity13 ‘ weakened the chancellor ’s fiscal credibility ’ , @entity84 ’s said it will reassess the ‘ @entity80 ’ rating in early 2013 and @entity89 ’s has the matter under review			1
how we compare : international gdp growth rates for the third quarter ( source : @entity28 ) however , market commentators believe the loss of the rating , while embarrassing for the chancellor , would not make much difference to the country ’s borrowing costs			1
this is because the @entity4 is one of few nations with a credible plan to restore stability			0
city economist @entity108 of @entity109 said : ‘ it ’s another month of disappointing deficit data and it ’s pretty clear now that barring unexpected positive developments , the underlying deficit will widen this year , compared with 2011 - 12			1
’ analysts at @entity115 warned if there was further slippage of the economy in 2013 the @entity4 would ‘ possibly lose its aaa rating ’			1
graph showing workers ' pay increases , quarter on quarter ( source : @entity28 ) so far this year the government has borrowed £ 92.7billion – £ 8.3billion more than in the first eight months of last year			0
however , the end - of - year numbers will be improved by several one - offs , including a contribution from the @entity128 , the sale of new mobile phone spectrum and a gain from the interest collected by the @entity58 on government debt			0
graph showing how the services sector has grown , quarter on quarter ( source : @entity28 ) the latest figures show the national debt – or the accumulated government borrowing over many years – has reached a record £ 1,083billion , or 68.5 per cent of the annual national output			0
mr @entity1 had promised that by the time the @entity141 leaves office in 2015 - 16 the national debt would be falling as a proportion of output or gdp			0
but the latest figures from the @entity146 show the first dip will not take place until 2016 - 17 , when it will fall to 79.2 per cent of @entity19 , breaking the government ’s fiscal rule			0
@entity152 prime minister @entity151 resigned last night , keeping a pledge to step down after parliament approved his budget			0
mr @entity151 , a respected economist , took over as head of a technical government last year as @entity152 ’s borrowing costs soared			0
he is credited for steadying his country ’s economy following the premiership of @entity162 .			2

newly released data indicates the economy is doing less well than hoped
