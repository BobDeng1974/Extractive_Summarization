as his old side gears up to try and force further misery upon bitter rivals @entity1 , @entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on @entity6 and his tenure at @entity8			1
speaking to @entity9 , @entity0 , who was a coach at @entity11 during sir @entity13 's era , blasted @entity15 's personal skills and implied his fellow @entity16 has been fortunate with how results have panned out for him			1
' we are nearly at @entity19 now and look at the performances			0
i still do n’t see a flow , a rhythm , ' @entity0 said			0
' they win five on the spin but they were absolutely pummelled at @entity27 and should have lost against @entity28			0
@entity0 was a coach at @entity8 under the era of sir @entity13 ( left ) @entity6 has also faced criticism from @entity31 and @entity32 about his side 's style of play ' he will blow up at some point			1
that ’s part of his make - up			0
' if you go and sit with @entity15 , you ’ll come out thinking ‘ i ’m 12 years old ’			2
he will speak to you as if you have no clue			0
he will look at you and be thinking ‘ what are you asking me ? i ’m @entity6 ’			0
